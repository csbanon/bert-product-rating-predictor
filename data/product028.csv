The noise cancellation is awesome and works well with cancelling out noises such as: 55 gallon fish tank with tetra air pump and filters; Honeywell hepa air purifier 50250S on high mode; central a/c on; dogs snoring.I can still hear people talking if they are 10ft away having a full conversation but it does help some. (I tested it in the office) For the price it meets my personal needs. The sound quality works equal or better than my iPhone 7s connecting headset. Sync to Bluetooth was a breeze. Love the case and doesn't take long to charge. The headphone is comfortable. Quality seems well bit. I will post an update if it breaks. :),5,1,2017-9-13,1,2,0
"After seeing all the high reviews for these headphones, I purchased them with the expectation that they were going to be amazing, I came to the realization that those reviews were not accurate. I’m of the belief that those high reviews were left after the initial use of the headphones.Construction quality - They feel flimsy at best. The earphones are comfortable but the unit tends to slide off of ones head and doesn’t stay in place. After using them for a few months one of the earphones broke away from the unit and is only hanging by a wire. For the life of me I can’t figure out how it happened or how it was even staying in place.",1,1,2018-12-21,1,1,1
"Absolutely love these. I have no issues. Generally, as long as the volume is high enough, I cannot hear anyone when music is playing (which I guess is the goal) but if it isn't high enough you can still here things. The color is really pretty...these have even fallen a few times and are still working great and perfectly. So they don't seem to break easily. I was little worried about buying some random brand of headphones but no regrets! The sound quality is great. The bass is great. I have no issues with it connecting to bluetooth as long as there are no other devices around it that it is connected to. IE, if my computer is on and my phone is on....it will choose to connect to whichever one the BT picks up first, which seems to always be the one that I don't want it to connect to. The battery lasts a very long time. As an example, one time I left them on a whole day and the battery still lasted a few more days before needing a charge.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0
"I have tried many other brands of headphones and comparatively these look much nicer than some of the really expensive brands I have tried. The sound quality is also great and they block outside noise very well. I purchased these for a long haul flight I was taking and they were extremely comfortable and not super bulky and heavy. I am very pleased with the battery life too. Overall these are a great pair of headphones and I would recommend them to anyone, especially if you will be wearing for long periods of time.",5,1,2017-10-24,1,2,1
The right swivel axis broke AGAIN after 6 months of everyday use.  They're totally useless now and I had hoped they would of lasted longer.They were great while they worked but won't buy it again because I want something that will last longer.,1,1,2018-1-28,1,1,0
"I purchased these to use while studying. I'm a stay at home mom/college student and needed something to help block the noise of cartoons while studying. They block out background noises so I can easily focus on what I'm reading for school, and they visually tell my family that I'm working on homework. They're super comfortable and stay on really well. I was a little concerned about the potential to be too heavy, or to slip, but these are nicely cushioned in both the ears and headband. I really love that I can use them corded with my laptop, or via Bluetooth to watch some Netflix on my phone while laying with a sleeping kid. They hold a great charge so I can go from watching videos, to doing school work, to listening to podcasts while folding laundry while my kid naps. The Bluetooth range seems to be quite good, too! Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase, it has turned out to be much more versatile than I had originally anticipated, and that's fantastic! I don't think I would have made it through my accelerated summer class without them!",5,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"I have tried two competitor's products before...I had just about decided to give up on wireless when I came across the E7 and thought if I buy it and it sucks at least I could get a free no-hassle return.It came early (Thx, Amazon) and the first thing I noticed was the quality feel. It came fully charged and once I got it paired with my phone I played a classical selection that tests highs and lows well...I closed my eyes and could easily imagine I was in a concert hall. I loved it!!!",5,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0
"I got this noise cancelling headset because my house is very busy/loud all the time. Sometimes I just need to focus on one thing or have some peace. Not to mention, the sound these have is amazing. I grew up going to concerts in the 80’s & 90’s so I love LOUD music.My favorite thing to do is throw these on and crank up the music. The best part is I never miss a phone call. Owning a business, I have to be available to my customers. The addition of the phone features are what sold me on these. Plus, the battery life is really long as well. I don’t think I could have found a better choice for such a great price.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,1,1
"I really like these headphones. Yes they are clunky. But the sound quality is excellent for both music and audiobooks and the Wireless bluetooth battery lasts forever on one charge, not like those small ones that only last 2.5 hours on a charge. These last like 8 hours on one charge. They also cut the ambient noise around me if I want to activate the noise cancelling option. I never do because I use these to travel with and I need to hear what's around me. These headphones get me ""there and back again"" with a minimum of fuss. I just wish they were a little smaller.",5,1,2018-11-16,1,2,0
"Today I discovered that my prior top-rated critical review of this item had been deleted at some point, without notification.I purchased these headphones on Amazon and initially wrote a very positive, detailed review. I subsequently updated my review when these headphones malfunctioned.",1,1,2019-7-16,1,6,0
"Wow. These are absolutely phenomenal headphones. I bought them about a year and a half ago and I use them all the time. I had a pair of on ear headphones from a no-name brand a few years ago and, while they served their purpose, they were not impressively loud and became a little aggravating on the ears after a while. These sit very comfortably on my head while I do chores around the house or yard work etc. I run a mobile auto detailing business in my spare time and use them for that as well.  I don’t have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big noggin. If I find myself looking down for too long they will start to slip off my head. I wouldn’t even attempt to do any kind of cardio with these. Weightlifting, sure but running - no. They are too loose and when using the noise canceling feature, any excess movement makes it crackle.The noise canceling is pretty decent. It’s not Bose quality but it’s plenty powerful to muffle a mower, vacuum or grinder. It almost entirely mutes plane noise. Like I mentioned, it doesn’t take much jostling to make it crackle, but if it becomes too annoying I just turn the NC off.",5,1,2018-4-24,1,3,1
I want to give special attention and rating to COWIN's AMAZING customer service.I never imagined they could be so kind and understanding and after contacting them I just had to go back and write this thankful review.,5,1,2018-12-9,1,8,0
"I am not a professional of any sort, just a 69 year old guy who wears hearing aides who wanted a good and comfortable pair of wireless headphones to use with my laptop while watching Netflix and YouTube. Bought two pair, the other one for my wife.The Cowin E-7 is a beautifully crafted, very comfortable, noise cancelling headphone and the sound quality everything I had hoped for. It paired up quickly with my HP Laptop on the first attempt without any hesitation. The fit and finish is near perfect in my opinion. The attractive brushed aluminum frame is very attractive, well padded and oh so smooth to the touch. It came with a nice leather like travel bag, a cord for direct connection to a cell phone, laptop or other similar device and a USB cable for charging the lithium battery. After performing a good long over night first-time battery charge, I used them for six continuous hours glorious comfortable hours. There was no fading of sound and the battery seemed to be ready for several more hours of use. The volume control is smooth and adjusts easily. The sound remained clear, crisp and easy to listen to from the highest to the lowest volume setting.",5,1,2017-7-20,1,1,0
"This product is on par with big brand names (and I have used several of them including Bose and Dr. Beats for over 6 months). It works just fine with cellphones and tablets. When turned on, it automatically connects to my cellphone every time after the initial set up. Voice quality for phone conversations is good; people at the other end could easily hear me. Wired connection is good as well.When one side of the heaphone did not work, I contacted the seller. They promptly responded back and took care of the issue, which I'm very happy about. I would highly recommend this product and the seller.",5,1,2017-5-9,1,8,0
Nicely packed. They are light have great sound. I noticed if you have the noise cancelling on and you barely bump them they make a crackling sound also the music sounds more like it's in a hall. With noise cancelling off they sound excellent crisp sound great bass the works. They are great headphones. UPDATE: THESE HEADPHONES ARE STILL AWESOME.MUSIC SOUNDS BETTER ON BLUTOOTH AND NOT WITH THE NOISE CANCELLING ON. YOU CAN SAVE $10.00 BY BUYING THE VERSION WITHOUT NOISE CANCELLING. THEY REALLY DON'T CANCEL OUT NOISE BUT WITH THE MUSIC PLAYING YOU DON'T HEAR OUTSIDE NOISE AND THE MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE YOUR THERE OR EVEN BETTER. GREAT QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP. VERY WELL BUILT,5,1,2017-1-6,1,6,0
"Two weeks after first receiving these headphones, I find myself using them for a few hours everyday. They're comfortable enough for long listening periods, and I now consider the sound quality to be above average. 8.5/10 stars.I also forgot to mention the noise canceling feature in my initial review - 8.5/10 stars. Very good at masking ambient noise while preserving the integrity of the audio you're listening to. I'd say ambient noise is about 85‰ eliminated, which should put these headphones at least in the $150 range. On a full charge, no static, dropouts, or interference in the strong Bluetooth connection. After a few hours, the wireless connection destabilizes a bit, but I don't know any headphones that don't do the same thing. Plus, the shakey signal could just as easily be my computer's fault. That makes the ability  to charge these headphones and listen at the same time a very useful feature.",5,1,2017-9-16,1,4,1
"Look, I can't compare these to Bose, because I've never tried them before - or any other $300 pair of headphones. However, these are fantastic for me. I work in an open office environment and sometimes the level of noise spikes from ambient to distracting to intolerable (you know how there's always that one person in the office louder than everybody else? I sit next to five of them). The very first day, my colleague and I looked at each other and nodded, it's time for noise cancelling headphones - so I did some research, read some reviews, and bought two Cowin E-7's for us.Having never tried active noise cancelling before, I have to say I'm impressed (my coworker didn't like it, as the noise cancelling made her feel queasy, but that's not Cowin-specific, just the technology in general doesn't agree with her). For me, it puts a strong damper on the background noise. Now if people are talk-yelling loudly, of course I can still hear them, which is great because if someone yells FIRE! I'd like to know about it. But I'm streaming my Boston sports radio and my Pearl Jam and clacking away while my noisy keyboard to get some revenge to those who don't have noise-cancelling headphones like these.",5,1,2016-11-17,1,2,0
"I only had a pair of these for 2 months now and so far, they have been the best headphones I ever bought on this site! These E7 Noise Cancelling Headphones have been so comfy, easy, and convenient to use ever since the first day I took it out the box and started using them. They are pretty much my dream headphones I wanted to have when I relax, listen to music, watch TV, play video games, or even lie down (well on my back because the headphones are pretty big).Now I'll be honest, I felt very skeptical at first when getting these because they were going to be the most expensive wireless headphones I ever bought at the time, and I didn't wanted to become upset that I'm basically buying Beats headphones. But these $67 headphones that are capable of rechargeable noise cancelling, the most comfortable ear cushions ever, and a pretty long battery life shown me that they are most definitely worthy to buy!",5,1,2018-7-25,1,2,1
"July 31st 2017:I have had these for a week now and they are great wireless headphones. The unit is sturdy and built well. They are comfortable to wear, highly adjustable,have a soft/cushy pad, and fit quite snug around my ears. The bluetooth range is actually very good, I had no problems walking around the house with a strong connection. They connect flawlessly with my Samsung S6 and reconnect as soon as they are turned on. The NFC also works well to establish a connection almost instantaneously. Phone calls can be easily picked up and dropped with the play button. The active noise cancelling is decent. Microphone was pretty clear and my friend was able to hear me talk quite well. The buttons on the unit are somewhat shakey but still feel sturdy (they arent going to fall off).  The pouch that comes with it is awesome to protect your headphones from scratches.",5,0,2017-8-7,1,2,1
"These were my first wireless headphones so I got these based on the good reviews. Not at all disappointed. Work great, Comfortable and were a great price. I am very pleased and have no problem recommending these headphones. Not a Audiophile so cant get get into technical stuff but they sound great. I had an old set of Bose headphones I think were close to $300 and to be fair there is not that much difference.",5,1,2017-5-15,1,2,0
I just upgraded my iPhone and I wanted to buy myself an nice set of headphones as a treat. I listen to lots of music. I figured I'd look at the bose and the beats. Every time I did a search for noise canceling headphones these kept popping up. I'd look past them. But then they'd pop up again. The high end headphones are pretty expensive. So I figured I'd give these a try for $70. Worst case I'd send them back and buy something better. But WOW. THEY SOUND GREAT!  Nice and clear and crisp. Great range of sound.  Nice balance. Not too heavy. Great range at both ends of the sound spectrum. The noise canceling nicely lowers ambient sound. The headphones are light weight and very comfortable to wear. And the battery charge is great. They came charged. I've been listening here for 3 hours just relaxing. James Taylor. Boston pops. Trans Siberian orchestra. Garth brooks. I've tried a nice mix. I'm very pleased. They paired easily. Only annoyance as others mentioned is the volume controls are reversed. Top button lowers sound and bottom raises it. Very well made and comfortable to wear. They seem built to be quite durable and very high quality. They feel high quality in the hands and on the head. They even come with a storage bag. No charger. Only a cable. But they will charge from any USB charger.Update over a year later. I'm still loving these headphones. I recently tried in a set of beats. And compared backnand forth. I'd argue these sound just as good. I'm still lovin them. Listen to music nearly every night and these are wonderful.,5,1,2017-2-10,1,3,0
"I've had these for 6 months and they were doing great until today when the left ear piece broke. I bought these for using at my desk, so I don't move them around. So, they shouldn't have broken because there is no wear and tear on them. When not in use, they sit on my desk. I was surprised today when I picked them up to find the headphones broken. They no long lay flat against my left ear. Before they broke, the sound quality was good but not 100% noise cancelling. They do block out a good amount of sound but if you want true noise cancelling headphones, these are not it. They are comfortable as I could wear them for basically 8 hours a day. But they are a bit bulky. Since they broke, I need to find a new pair. I don't know that I'll be purchasing these again.",1,1,2018-12-6,1,1,1
"These do a great job of blocking out sound. IBackground noise that is static, such as a noisy air conditioner or lawnmower, just disappear. Voices do not get cancelled so much, BUT: The passive noise cancelling of these headphones (just by sheer blocking of sound), and playing music or white noise, I can completely block out my kids while I'm doing work from home or homework.and my kids are NOISY!!!",5,1,2017-10-13,1,2,0
I loved the Cowin E-7 so much that I ended up getting a  second one for my wife! They will come in handy when we go flying soon thanks rto the noise cancellation technology great product! Sound is great syncing to your device is a breeze do yourself a  favor and pick up a case as well (the case is sold separately) there tailor made for this model(I'll do a separate review after my trip) wich combined(they compliment each other) is still a fraction of the price of a major brands similar product,5,1,2017-7-31,1,2,1
"These headphones are great, especially considering the price.  They replaced an older set of Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 phones, and there really is no comparison (note - I have no idea if the newer Audio Technica headphones are better than the ones I own).  The Cowin’s are much more comfortable, and the noise reduction is far better.I bought the original AR's for long haul airplane travel.  They were only OK, with noticeable background noise.  They were also too tight on my head, even with bending the headband, and the ear pieces were shaped such that they pressed on my ears, creating pain after a while.",5,1,2018-8-3,1,2,0
I just purchased the Cowin E7 (69.00)noise cancelling headphones from Amazon today for our upcoming trip to Tibet and they sound excellent.  I am returning a pair of 250.00 Sony XB950N1 Extra Bass Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones because the Cowin’s sound just as good and last longer (30 hours vs 22 hours for the Sony - long enough for any of our trips).I have been playing it right out of the box with no charge for two hours now and you are suppose to charge it for 7 hours before using it.  I ordered it at 8 this morning and it was sitting on my doorstep at 6 pm today - same day delivery.,5,1,2017-7-3,1,2,0
"Better sound than what I get from my 6-month old wireless Bose SoundLink II which is surprising considering the cost of the Bose pair. And I do not think that the Bose headphones are defective either, but after getting this pair and comparing the sound, I think that the Bose pair may be over-hyped and consequently overpriced.It's kind of like the situation with Reebok's, Nike's, and Beats earphones. As long as the brand has enough street-cred among a certain clientele, a ""classiness"" label gets attached to the brand and a higher quality rating becomes more a result of assumption rather than objective evaluation against less-known peer brands. I don't really blame so much the customers for this though as I do marketing departments.",5,1,2017-4-19,1,2,0
"I bought these headphones about 9 months ago.  I absolutely loved them.  The active noise cancelling is amazing.  You can really tell the difference when you turn it on.  They synced no problem with both of my phones, and the buttons to control the volume or stop and play the music work great with my phone and Amazon music and the Relax Melodies app.Yesterday, I opened my headphone case and found that they had broken.  The articulating piece on one side is plastic, and had sheared off.  I emailed the seller through Amazon, and by the end of the day, I had a code to order a new set for free!",5,1,2018-2-22,1,2,0
I travel by air approximately 20 times a year and finally decided to invest in a pair of bluetooth headphones with noise cancelling when I started to shop I immediately realized they were say huge price variance As you move from manufacturer to manufacturer chose this particular model because it seemed the possess all the features I was interested in at a reasonable cost I've now Taken 3 trips by air since I received these Bluetooth headphones and I couldn't be more impressed first of all the styling appealed to me the function of having the ear sections completely rotatable is a huge Advantage for packing the battery life is more than acceptable and they are incredibly comfortable almost pillow like against your ears but the real test for me was the noise cancelling feature having already owned a pair of bluetooth headphones without a noise cancelling feature it was an easy comparison for me to make and I immediately was impressed that when I had the noise canceling feature on ambient engine noise was almost 100% eliminated I've used them to listen to music as well as movies as I travel and I'm very pleased with the sound quality the other nice feature is that you get to choose whether the noise cancelling feature is on or off so when wearing them around the house where ambient noise isn't a problem you don't have to have this feature on and your sound quality is a little bit better if you're looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones with active noise cancelling that is literally hundreds of dollars less than the big-name brands but delivers in a huge way I would highly recommend these,5,1,2017-5-31,1,5,0
"I wear headphones for 10 to 12 hours a day.  I take online classes and listen to audio books to relax.  I have a massive music collection.  I can't tell you how many different headphones I've gone through over the last few years.  Actually I probably could since they were all ordered through Amazon.  Most of them start out nice, and then inevitably in about a month one speaker goes out and you are left with headphones that send sound to only one ear.I have never used headphones more than I use this pair.  They have more than passed the test of time.  Additionally I find my daughters trying to copy me and wear them all the time.  Their toddler and infant hands have very little control so they get dropped.  Still they work perfect.",5,1,2017-5-8,1,2,0
"I'm a software developer, and I've been able to evaluate these headphones in two different office environments. The first one was a very small space in which our misguided CTO thought it would be cool and productive to fit as many people as possible. He was loud and kind of dorky and pretty much the main reason I had for buying these headphones. I couldn't swing a more expensive pair, so I went with these, based on the good reviews I'd read.In a small room with a Loud Howard type, I don't think earplugs or any noise canceling headphones could totally block out ambient noise (ridiculously talking about every. single. thing). These did help somewhat to dampen the volume of the incessant conversations happening around me.",5,1,2017-7-31,1,2,0

"Review and ImpressionI’m excited to have a good quality bluetooth headset that smooths out outside sound to a muffle and have great quality sound and base lines. There is a minor tinny sound to some music but that’s usually the source too. Wearing these isn't embarrassing and I like the look, I like how they wirelessly connect fast and handle handsfree smoothly.  They fold flat by rotating the cups to fit in a backpack or luggage. But why? 30 hour battery life you can wear this on a trip. NYC to Hawaii with 1 full charge. I forget I’m wearing these and they don’t produce much heat or become cumbersome around the ears or pull on my head. The microphone is responsive, but i pull one ear cup off to talk on the phone so i can hear myself so i don’t speak too loud. Walking and listening to music can be dangerous in headphones, these overcome traffic and noise with the onboard microphone(s?) for noise canx. The battery is removable and replaceable.",5,1,2017-5-22,1,2,0

"The good:  They sound amazing! Battery life is great also (I charge mine about once a week with 3-6 hours of usage per day). And they are extremely comfortableThe bad: Once the battery gets to a certain point, the right speaker will ""pop"" so to speak when on noise cancellation and you make sudden movements. I assume it reacts a bit too slow at that point, or the cups suction slightly to my head causing a pressure difference.. It definitely has something to do with noise cancelling feature though. That is fine, flip to regular bluetooth, and that issue goes away.",5,1,2017-3-8,1,2,0
"I received these for Christmas and was very pleased with the fit, comfort and sound. Very soon though it because apparent that the buttons on the ear piece for volume were not working as they should. While pairing has been easy, the ability to answer the phone while wearing them never worked. I don't know if it was the button or what, but I never got a chance to use the microphone. There was also random noise in the left ear piece, especially when the noise cancelling mode was on. Not sure what to do, I used Amazon's contact link to write to the seller, Cowin. They responded very, very quickly with a coupon code to replace the headphones. No questions, no red tape, just great customer service. I'm very happy! These headphones feel so good to wear. They sound great too. I'm very hopeful that the new pair will arrive in great working condition.***edited 2-17-17***",5,1,2017-1-30,1,4,0

"UPDATE: Several months after my purchase, customer service reached out to me about the issues I was having. I increased my rating from 1 star to 3 stars for this reason, as the representative was very sweet and accommodating (Thank you, Lexi). I do not support the philosophy of this company, however, as they tried to coerce me into deleting my negative review for a free pair of upgraded headphones. Whereas I do appreciate the upgraded headphones I received (still not the greatest quality), I thought that was very duplicitous and could not in good faith support that kind of deception- especially as a customer who purchased this item BECAUSE of all the great reviews. That being said, if you are willing to spend a little more money but still not as much as a pair of Beats etc., Cowin's E8 headphones are a much better option (warning: they beep every time a song skips, every time you touch your phone screen, get a notification, touch a control button etc).*****************************************************************",3,1,2019-5-10,1,3,0

First, for those that claim this is comparable to Bose anc, it's not. Definitely not. But given the price, they're acceptable. BUT, these had that weird compression feeling when the anc was turned on...and a bit of hiss. I've had similar experiences with some other anc headphones (not Bose) which is why i'm a bit wary when it comes to anc cans.

I am happy with this purchase and I would recommend them to others.,5,1,2017-7-21,1,3,0
"I had initially gave these headphones a bad review because out of the box there was static in the earpiece. This was a second pair ordered btw! After my negative review i recieved an email from the company asking to recind my review for an additional refund or new pair of headphones. I deleted my review for the refund and was assured i would get it. Well, it has been 2 weeks and have not seen a refund anywhere. So my review will stay nowJust for info...i purchased a different brand of headphones and they work great.",1,1,2019-3-3,1,4,0
"Love these as noise cancelling, with the bonus of Bluetooth music!  I use them almost everyday to listen to music and once a week to cut and trim my lawn...though I'm sure my neighbors don't care my sing-along lyrics!  Initially, they felt a bit bulky and large, as I'm use to earbuds, big difference.  However, once you enjoy the noise cancelling capability and the easy to setup Bluetooth music, you will not notice the size/weight.  Look over the instructions first, as it is a bit challenging to find and identify each switch/control.  You must plug it into your computer USB port to charge it up; have not checked out any of my chargers to see if any of them are compatible, i.e., not to overcharge it.  As far as how long the charge last, I've used it for three-four hours before I recharged it, as there is not power gauge to show you the charge level.  The ear muffs fold inward, so it can lay flat and minimal storage room.",5,1,2017-5-4,1,2,0
"Above and beyond probably one of the best pair of headphones I have ever purchased. Not only well worth the money, but I've been converted from Beats to these. Absolutely would recommend these.The sound quality is crisp and enjoyable, trust me when I say the noise cancelling version is worth the extra money. If you're a fan of softer music like score or jazz and hate that you can't listen to it well in public, that mode helps quite well with it. The design is comfortable and fits snugly on the head. The ear padding is fairly well set and actually feels like it breathes a little, so not a lot of worry for sweat from that area. Headband is snug, and the entire structure of it feels sturdy. Sure, it doesn't bend, but the rotating cuffs work well also. Just take note that because of the design, you may not even need to turn on the sound cancelling to even mute outside noise. The design naturally does a little of that already, so the sound cancelling is a little bit extra.",5,1,2017-3-5,1,2,0
"Cancels screechy noises like the broken A/C at work.Not the best headphones I've used or the quietest earplugs, but still an excellent combination at an excellent price, and easily a ""5 star"" value in this price range.",5,1,2016-11-9,1,2,0

We ordered the Cowin E-7 ear phones for our son-in-law as a birthday present..(his 54th)..He was impressed as soon as he pulled them our of the box and started trying them out.. All of the 20's aged grandkids had to try them out too and also were impressed.. which is not easy you know!!.. He has been using it now for about 4 days and let us know today that the new Cowin E-7 work beautifully and he  knows that he will get a lot of enjoyment out of them. We think those are the best recommendations you could get...so we gave them 5 stars...,5,1,2017-5-3,1,2,0
"I wanted to find a pair of decent wireless noise-cancelling headphones for travel. The Cowin E7 headphones fit the bill and the budget.I'd rate the sound quality on the E7's as very good. They perform as advertised, with a strong base. I was impressed by the wireless range with Bluetooth, as I could walk into another room without any decrease in perceived audio bit-rate. But Bluetooth has its quirks sometimes, so I'm glad that the headphones come with a regular 1/8 inch stereo jack as a backup if the wireless is having issues.",5,1,2019-9-16,1,1,1

"I purchased these headphones in August 2018, and paired it with a three year warranty through SquareTrade. The sound was alright, though you can't walk with the sound canceling activated - it cuts in and out of the music.By November, both earphones had popped out of their rotation socket. Both happened as I was putting the headphones on, first the right ear than the next week the left ear popped out. Currently it's held together by tape which I have to reapply every few hours. I am incredibly disappointed with the product. I use these headphones solely at my desk and still, they fell apart. Literally.",1,1,2018-12-4,1,8,1
"The Cowin E-7 headphones are very impressive. Have great bass, excellent high and lows. They come nicely packaged with a micro USB charger, a 3.5 mm plug in cord, and a nice looking vinyl pouch. They are extremely easy to pair, have the operating controls positioned in the right place and come with an excellent warranty. The range is great and the battery life is amazing, at 30+ hours of operation. You can't go wrong with these headphones, the build quality is excellent and they look amazing, very expensive. If you want a good over the ear headphones, at a very reasonable price, I highly recommend the Cowin E-7. These headphones are on par with many more expensive brands.",5,1,2017-9-4,1,4,1
"I was going to get the Bose (It is easy to experience the Bose product by just walking in a best buy store where they have the Bose ready to sample as sound quality and noise canceling functionality. When I put on the Bose in the store, there was fairly loud music playing from the overhead speakers and amazingly the noise canceling function of the Bose made the overhead music magically disappear almost entirely and you really had to pay attention to listen to it. Also very important to note that although the Bose earphones are over-ear they feel more like on-ear and very, very comfortable.",3,1,2017-8-31,1,1,1
"I bought these on a sale since I was looking to purchase a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones. For the price, I couldn't beat it, so I ordered them. All seemed well and good for the first day of use. Noise cancelling didn't do much, but the Bluetooth connected fast with great range and they were quite comfortable. The reason I rate this one star is the second day of use, there was an extremely loud static that happened suddenly in the right earphone. When I say ""extremely loud"", I mean ""I had to rip them off my head because it physically hurt"" loud. The sound occurred with the Active Noise Cancelling switch on. I don't dare use these as I'm afraid it will happen again.",1,1,2017-12-21,1,4,0
"Nicely Built. But Squeezes My Head & Ears Hard Therefore You Can Not Wear It On Long Flights.  Battery Life Is Good. Good If You Want To Connect To Air Plane Monitor.

"I mistakenly did not read the reviews before purchasing these. I was excited to get such a great ""deal"" on them - clearly you get what you pay for. Although the ear pads are as soft as advertised, it doesn't matter when you cannot move your head without the sound/noise cancelling quality cutting in and out. I received the package, opened the box, tried them on and moved my head to the right when the right speaker cut out. I thought ""huh, maybe it's my phone?"" I used them with two other devices and suffered the same issues. This is not an issue of receiving a faulty pair as I went back and read the reviews and see that almost ALL reviews complain of the same issue! This site should not carry products that have the same complaints in reviews over and over again, or there should be a warning before purchasing. They simply do not work.",1,1,2018-12-3,1,1,0
"Awesome headphones!!! I bought these for work.  I share a very large office another person and needed something to block his constant talking to himself. I have several other Bluetooth sets of headphones be I can't turn them up load enough to dround him out without doing damage to my hearing (I've tried). These work magnificently!!! The sound quality is exceptional, very very close to my Bose headphones but at less than a quarter of the cost. Highly recommend these.",5,1,2017-3-14,1,2,0
I used these on a 14 hour flight to HKG and back. I wore these for 5-6  hours of the flight. Battery held up great. They were comfortable and did not hurt my ears after several hours. Noise cancellation was not perfect but muffled out the engine roar well. Aren't as loud as I prefer but were loud enough to hear movie dialog from my movie. I am suggesting that my wife buy a pair since I was happy with them.,4,1,2017-2-10,1,2,0
"These are fairly inexpensive noise cancelling headphones. I'm not a huge fan of the plastic silver or the big button, but that's subjective. They feel fairly sturdy and reasonably well made. I have large ears, unfortunately, so any around/over the ear headphones are generally uncomfortable for me. I wore these for an hour in my house and they did not give me a headache or pinch my ears as many headphones do.I am not an audiophile, but the sound seemed a bit muddy to me. I did come from headphones which plug in and I understand that bluetooth degrades sound quality. There are evidently headphones which support higher resolution sound from bluetooth; I am not sure if these do or not because my Android phone doesn't support the standard anyway.",3,1,2018-2-1,1,1,0
"The headphones looked great and felt great on my head. The first issue I had with them was that while listening to music at normal volume, the music was very loud and clear to people standing next to me. I can’t imagine using these headphones on an airplane for example, without disturbing passengers around you. The bigger issue is what seemed like a defect. With noise cancelling turned on, when I would turn my head I would hear static for a split second. I then realized that touching the ear pieces also resulted in static. I sent these back to amazon because of these issues.",1,1,2018-5-3,1,3,0
"I would like to say that the appearance and comfort of these headphones are great and the bluetooth function is easy to use. I just spent the entire day traveling on planes and in airports and the battery life is very good. At one stop I did add a bit of charge to them but just to be safe type thing and I don't believe I would have had an issue if I didn't. They also come with a plug so that if you wanted to use them with a unit that had no bluetooth, they would also work.Overall the noise canceling works well as long as there is a song playing. However at that point in between songs you can hear quite a bit of outside noise and on planes you still get some of the plane noise. This didn't bother me and for the price and I'm very happy. I did have a previous pair of Bose NC headphones and they cancelled almost all noise but then again they were way more expensive and #2 they died after 2 years.",5,1,2017-4-12,1,5,0
"No complaints....light, comfortable for 10 hour plane ride, stayed charged for 10 hour plane ride, worked great and look good (as far as wearing headphone looks!).  Used the bluetooth for music from my cell, no problem, sound was crystal clear.  Used the noise cancelling feature...you need to know that it doesn't cancel the noise per se but it does reduce it dramatically.  If the jet engine noise without headphones is a 10 and you put these on and go to noise cancel mode the noise goes down to a 2.  Makes it so much quieter for sleeping or simply not having to have the jet noise so loud.  But you can still hear announcements etc when they occur.  I won't fly without them again.  Great product.",5,1,2017-4-30,1,2,0
"As a set of bluetooth headphones, I have no complaint.  The audio quality may  not impress audiophiles, but it is good enough for me, in fact better than any other headphones I've owned.  And the bluetooth connection has never dropped for me—something I can't say for other bluetooth products.  If I had paid $30 for a set of Bluetooth headphones I'd be very happy with my purchase.  But these are advertised as having active noise cancellation, which is a complete crock of $%1+.  There is no detectable noise cancellation.For example, I'm in my office with a bass-heavy song playing loudly in my ears through these things, and a relatively quiet fan behind me is still audible.  There is ZERO noise cancellation.  And YES, in case you're about to ask, I DO have the switch on the headphones set to the NC position.  I can't discern any difference between the two ""on"" positions, with and without (the supposed) noise cancellation.",1,1,2019-6-27,1,1,0
"I pulled the triggersd on this and all I can say was WOW, one of the worst headphones I have owned.  I will admit, I was so excited all day to receive this based on reviews I read and the feedback from happy customers.  Unfortunately, mine was the opposite.1. Easy pair was amazing",1,1,2019-6-25,1,9,0
"Got these on July 16, 2017 and today is October 11th 2017, and they quit working. They are fully charged, and are kept in the protective case always, there was no damage due to being poorly cared for or dropped. Do not buy these! The noise cancelling doesn't work either, save up your money and buy Bose.*EDIT TO ADD UPDATE* The company I bought these from read my review and sent me a new headphone at no extra cost to me. They worked fine until last week, in the middle of my work day when the sound just stopped. It showed that my audio book was still playing, and it displayed correctly when I pushed the button on the right earpiece to pause, but there was no sound...nothing. So this pair worked for an even shorter time than the first pair. Now I have 2 sets of headphones that don't work, and I'm even more bummed. I can honestly say the quality in comparison with the cost is just not worth it...I will never buy this brand again, I've learned my lesson. I really wanted to be able to change my review for the better, sadly I think my opinion has gotten worse. This company ""Cowin"" needs to get some quality control people who actually know what they're doing.",1,1,2017-10-11,1,3,0

"Used these for 1 day and the left ear stopped working.  The noise canceling is not good at all I could hear everything.  But they are comfortable, a little heavy though.  So disappointed based on the other reviews that I read on amazon.OK this is an update on my review:  The customer service is awesome, I posted my previous review and returned the item and Joey from COWIN emailed me the next day and apologized for the problems.  He sent me a free pair to test and make up for the faulty pair that I received.  This pair was 100x better, the noise canceling is much better, its doesn't completely drowned out the background noise but it takes out most of it.  I can't here conversations around me hardly at all and the white noise that plays in my office is completely gone.  They are really comfortable and soft, I wore them for 18 hrs straight and didn't even feel like I had them on. the sound quality is really good, its not BOSE quality, but way more than I expected for the price point.  The battery life is crazy good, I didn't need charge them for a week and I accidentally left them on all night.  the range is good as well I went all the way to the other end of my office building and they still played.  They cut out when I went into the elevator.  As for using them to take phone calls, well the mic is pretty much like all the other blue tooth headsets, not to great.  People complained and said they couldn't really hear me.  I expected that b/c its the same response I get with all my hands free cell devices. They are very easy to pair and you can pair them with multiple devices.  One other really nice feature is that they also come with a cord to just plug them straight into your phone, ipod, or computer.  Which I needed as my office doesn't let you use the Bluetooth functions on their laptops.  I'm very thankful that I gave them another chance and these are a great buy for the price point.  I recommend them.  The customer service is worth just trying them.",5,1,2016-8-29,1,3,0
"EDIT:  I'm leaving my original review at the bottom.  But, I absolutely HAVE to mention the customer service experience I have had with COWIN.  Even after I had already returned the first set i bought, they were willing to ship me a completely new pair FOR FREE to allow me a chance to give them another, more lengthy test.  Which I absolutely have done, so i can say plenty more about them.  Fit wise, they are still not ideal for someone with my head size and ear size.  Which are definitely far above average.  But, after spending lots of time fiddling around with them, i found a way that they were at least comfortable enough to wear while doing chores around the house and other like tasks.  The max time I could stand was about 45 minutes, so definitely not good for marathon gaming sessions or Netflix binge watching.  The other major complaint I have about these is the noise cancellation.  Its mostly passive from the foam pad seal, which is actually VERY EXCELLENT.  However, when I turned on the active NC, it... didn't really do anything but muffle the music quite a bit while only SLIGHTLY reducing ambient noise more than just the seal does.  This is definitely an area of ""you get what you pay for"" so if more isolation is what you're looking for, you're gonna have to spend way more than $80.  Sound reproduction is absolutely top notch though.  Very clear and crisp while I was listening to house and electronica EDM.  The low end and bass is NOT punchy at all though.  Not something I care much about, but if that's something you want, you're also gonna have to look elsewhere.  Despite all its shortcomings though, I HIGHLY recommend this set of headphones.I'm going to preface this review with some simple facts.  I have a VERY BIG head (size 8 hats are usually uncomfortably snug, depending on the manufacture) and also abnormally sensitive ears.  I found the clamping force to be too snug for my taste and the ear cups pinched and flattened my ears to the point of discomfort in about 5 minutes.  However, if you are someone that doesn't suffer from such annoyances, you'll most likely love these.  The sound quality was fantastic for my use case (music and PC games).  I cant say anything about either the battery life or the noise cancellation as I dint own them long enough to test either.",4,1,2017-4-23,1,3,0
"Two of my coworkers in the office like theirs, but I must have gotten a bad pair. In less than 3 months the left ear is already having issues crackling on/off. Not to mention, both ears broke off, so I have been holding them together with rubber bands since month two. I sit in an office all day, not like I'm being rough with these or dropping them. These are truly the worst headphones I've ever had, and ironically more than I usually spend.",1,1,2018-4-3,1,2,0
"Update September 4, 2018:I see some buyers say they reached out to the seller to get help with their problems with this headset.  I did not. The seller reached out to me.  It was felt that I probably got a defective headset.  I was asked to give it another try or a complete refund.  I wanted it to work, so I decided to give them another try. I am glad I did. The seller had another pair delivered to me within two days.",4,1,2018-5-5,1,1,0

"My son bought a pair of these, and they were so comfy and worked so well that I decided to buy a pair for myself. Shortly after making my purchase, my son's broke. He only had his for a couple months, and took very good care of them, but one of the ear pieces, where it swivels, snapped in half. I was a little worried, but decided to take my chances. Well, just over a year later, mine did the same thing. Knowing that I could have the same problem, I've taken extra special care of these, but it didn't matter. The swivel piece is made of plastic, and because there's some pressure on it every time they're in use, I believe it will always break eventually. Great headphones otherwise, with great sound, but sadly they just aren't built to last. Very disappointed.",1,1,2019-7-13,1,1,0
"There are almost zero options for active noise canceling below $200. Some headphones say 'noise isolating,' but I wasn't sure they would do enough, so I settled for the Cowin E-7.First, the comfort is amazing. I can wear them for 8 hours without issue. It took me about a day to figure out how they should sit on my head, but once in position, they cover my ears do a good job of reducing ambient noise",5,1,2017-5-6,1,3,0
"I've had these headphones for about 5 months and want to make it clear...I really do like these headphones and would consider giving it 5 stars, but there are a couple of things that bring down the stars.PROS:  For the price you can't beat them.  They look slick, came packaged well to avoid any shipping damage, are comfortable for me, have nice quality sound when they play, and the noise REDUCTION (not cancelling, will get to that later) is decent.  I like to use these when flying to help reduce noise and they do a good job.  The bluetooth set up is simple and the battery lasts a while on a full charge.",3,1,2017-6-10,1,1,0
I've owned these for a couple of weeks.  The instructions are anemic and no help at debugging.I get a single blue flash every two seconds.  And five flashes every 60 seconds.

"Got these headphones for Christmas over a year ago. They work great, cancel noise pretty well, and feel very comfortable.

I tried to deal with it, but it couldn't even stay on my ear.",2,1,2018-1-24,1,1,0

"First of all, I'd like to say that when I bought this product, I kept in mind the wireless ability, noise cancelling feature, price, then quality, in that order. They also have an inline mic that is not the greatest. I didn't get this for the mic though. I mostly use this for casual use since I've gotten tired of wires trippin' out on me.1. Appearance 7/10 - It's made of plastic. It feels cheap but that's also a benefit, since it is quite light on the head. It came in a nice box with a microUSB - USB charger, slightly shorter than 2 feet. It does not come with a bag or anything to hold it, so if you're looking to have something to put it in for carrying, you'll have to get that separately. I bought a wireless bluetooth adapter to plug into my laptop, and while the sound won't go through thick walls or around corners easily, I'm plenty happy to have it at maximum quality while I'm in my room.",5,1,2016-8-31,1,3,0

"*updated review after customer service provided a replacement for the defective pair that was originally received.  I will still say that I find the controls to be not well thought out.  The up (top) button is designed to either skip back or turn the volume down. This is a counter-intuitive design.  I also dislike the main switch on the bottom that moves from the Off position to the On position (Bluetooth) and often slides right past the middle and all the way to the noise cancelation setting (which is a white noise that I find distracting due to the mic picking up subtle bumps and dimming the audio in order to squelch the noise).  Moving that slider back to the Bluetooth-only (On) setting usually results in turning the unit off due to the same issue of easily overshooting the step of the switch.  It also still appears that the power must be on in order to use the wired connection.  The audio is still pretty clear and the headphones are quite comfortable.  I don't think they'll stay on during heavy activity.  I'm leaning towards keeping these dedicated to use while playing guitar, or some casual listening around the house, but I don't have much greater expectations or plans for these headphones.Original review (in full):",3,1,2018-3-19,1,1,0
"I was going to use the product in school to cancel my load classroom as I work independently. It was claimed that these headphones use “noise isolation” ( which blocks out noise passively and without use of power ). I put them on when I got them and tested out the feature. There was no difference from wearing them to not wearing them. So I though, “okay, maybe they need battery power before they can isolate noise, for some unnecessary reason.” So I let them charge for 8+ hours and put them on. Still no difference. I turned on the active noise canceling feature ( which technically isn’t part of the product according to the manufacturer’s list of “extra features”). Active noise canceling SHOULD have replace the noise of the outside world with another noise, which it didn’t. There was still no difference from wearing them to not wearing them. I didn’t even bother testing if the Bluetooth worked or if it even produced sound. I just shipped it back. To any cowin employees, here’s a manufacturing tip; don’t claim that your product has something when it really doesn’t.",1,1,2019-3-10,1,1,0
"UPDATE:  Based on my review below, the seller reached out to me and provided a new set of ""optimized"" headphones. I'll upgrade my rating to 3 stars only because of the customer service response.While they do get an A for customer service, these new ""optimized"" headphones still do not provide any significant noise cancellation.  For comparison, I sat in my living room with my tv on normal volume.  I put on the headphones, but did not turn them on.  I could still hear the tv about as well as before.  I turned on the noise cancelling function and literally heard zero reduction in the tv volume.  The headphones were NOT paired to the tv.  I then got out those expensive ones my husband is so fond of and repeated the same steps.  His reduced the tv volume by about 25-30%.  I repeated the same experiment with both sets of headphones -- this time to listen to music on an Apple device.  Same results -- the expensive headphones cancelled out a lot of the background (tv) noise while these did not.  For the price, these are not bad headphones -- they just provide nowhere near the noise cancellation I've come to expect.  Disclaimer -- the husband who is so selfish with his expensive headphones tells me I hear noises only dogs can hear.  That might be the whole issue.",3,1,2017-9-1,1,1,0

"Used Cowin E7 on 4 flights and loved it. Then clicking sound started in one ear and got louder. Almost painful. On the 6th flight, the second earphone also started clicking, especially during turbulence and take off/landing. No longer able to use these.Also keep in mind, noise canceling does not work if you plug into the audio system on the plane, it only works if you are using wireless/bluetooth - which means you can listen to your recorded audio on the iPhone etc - or choose no sound, just reduce the background noise.",1,1,2017-9-4,1,3,0

"They're terrible. I have a phone that still has an aux outlet so I dont need bluetooth. That's part of why I got these. I hate how all headphones now are bluetooth only and it drains my phone's battery when I really dont need that. I like having the option of both bluetooth and aux so I can use these with my ipad and other devices but with these headphones in particular that's not an option. You have to be on full battery and if you only use corded like I did it doesnt matter, the battery still drains because you have to have bluetooth on to have these on in general. Why the hell would you even include an aux cable and outlet then? -1 star for basic designThey look good but form follows function",1,1,2019-12-20,1,3,0

Update: Contacted again by Cowin who made a generous offer to make this situation right. In addition to offering a replacement (which I would have expected) the tone and quality of the communication was extremely professional. The new headphones also seem to work better over bluetooth; the first pair stopped working after just a few feet while the new one works across the room.Broke after a few months. Contacted Cowin International support. They directed me to Cowin Amazon support. They gave me a voucher code to get a replacement pair. Voucher didn't work. They told me the voucher only works for a day (I tried to redeem 2 days after they sent) and gave me a new voucher. Didn't work. They told me the voucher only starts working the next day. We're now 15 total emails into this process which started April 25 and is not resolve today on May 5. Awful customer service. Would advise not to buy.,5,1,2017-5-5,1,1,1
"1. Appearance -nice looking headphones, though the metallic portion loves to hold onto fingerprints2. sound quality -seems to be pretty good, I like that I have been able to pair it with both my phone and my computer",3,1,2017-6-25,1,1,0

"[Initial review here, updated review in next paragraph]Wow. I've never written a product review so quickly after testing out my purchase! I'm sitting here listening to Tron's The Son of Flynn and I'm really impressed with the sound. But backing up just a bit. When I put these on right out of the box, before even turning them on, the world went silent all around me. No, not the active noise cancellation, just an amazing fit over my ears and great sound proof construction just shut out all noise. Pairing with my Lumia 950 was a breeze. The headphones came with enough juice in the battery that I could try them out before charging them, and that makes me happy. The controls are easy, they fit very comfortably, and the sound is fantastic.",4,1,2017-2-5,1,4,0
"First, product: I bought these headphones early this year to use while studying. I am a PhD student. The noise cancelling element is great and the bluetooth works very well. This allows me to pace comfortably around my apartment while thinking without having to worry about a cable or hear the traffic outside. As far as the range on the bluetooth, it goes for a few rooms, but gets choppy if I go to the other end of my apartment. It really isn't meant for distance. Keep your phone in the room though and it is great. Sound quality is acceptable, but these are certainly not recording studio quality.Second, customer service: about 2 months after I purchased them the bluetooth stopped playing in the right ear. I checked and they still worked fine with the cable. I emailed the company that night and within 12 hours they had offered to replace them and sent me a coupon code that covered the cost. Now I have a new pair that works great and I still have the broken pair that just works with the cable. I didn't have to bother with shipping it back or anything. These guys kick ass. Great experience.",5,1,2017-5-1,1,1,0
These are not comfortable on my head. Very tight in general fit wise. The ear muffs are smaller than my ears so my ears do not fit comfortablely inside the muffs.Sound qaulitly for playback (like listening to music or incoming call qaulity is really good. Surprisingly good bass.,2,1,2019-11-6,1,3,0
"I purchased this to obtain quiet sound output from my LG TV.  First, the instruction manual was printed in type so small that I could not read it.  After extensive search,  I finally obtained a downloadable PDF.  The controls themselves are very tiny, and must be operated mostly blind, while the headset is on your head -- how you can see the tiny LEDs when on your head is another problem.Next, I found it impossible to connect the device by Bluetooth to my (LG) TV.  The operation of the TV itself is very complex, completely unsupported by LG.  After about two days of unsuccessful manipulation of the complex and undocumented remote, Costco Concierge finally helped me to find a Bluetooth selection.  The headset responded with a ""dudududu"" sound as documented by Cowin, indicating that it was supposedly Bluetooth-connected.",1,1,2020-1-19,1,2,0
"So In my first review after purchasing these for my 26 year old son who landscapes for a living, he was initially impressed. He had been using his beats which were extremely sensitive to weather conditions, like rain, heat, cold etc but he really needed to have the noise canceling aspect as well as being able to hear his music above the din of his equipment. So fast forward 3 months and again I asked for a report, ""unbelievable"" I believe he said. Not a single complaint nor a single issue, through rainy (many) days and now humidity, much airborne dust and pollen, previous cold and now 80 plus days with full humidity, not a sausage, nothing negative at all. In fact he said ""they blow the beats away for quality and consistency""  for a fraction of the price. Blue tooth works perfectly even though his phone is sealed in a waterproof sleeve beneath his clothing, no disruption at all. Though they have never been submerged in water they have gone through the gamut of bad weather and never failed where as the rain was the downfall of his beats. So there, I hope that you find this helpful, should we encounter a problem I will report back 👍",5,1,2017-6-27,1,5,0
"Nothing is more annoying than being on a plane that's delayed on the tarmack before take-off. People are still talking on the phone, children are still screaming and there's no hope of escape.  These Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, however, are perfect for making that experience less tedious.These headphones are bluetooth but they come with a regular audio mini-plug connector so you can use them in a device that still has a headphone jack. This is great because it means you can use it with multiple devices without having to sync it to bluetooth on every device.  Bluetooth connectivity is good and didn't drop any sound when turning my head from side to side like some headphones are prone to do.",5,1,2019-3-31,1,2,0
"It didn't take long to realize these headphones had too much low frequency.  Without the noise cancelling the sound is completely different, sort of like listening to a very clean bass feed, a bit too vivid.  If you turn on noise cancellation, the bass dies down a bit, and the rest of the auditory frequency range comes to play, but it loses all definition and is unpleasant - almost an echo sound, boxed in.  Bottom line, the sound is not very good.  I will return it.Update. After returning these headphones for a refund, I have received multiple overtures from the vendor asking me to change my rating from three stars to five stars. I was offered free headphones and doubled up refund. The final straw is when I was offered upgraded headphones if I would reconsider my position. I agreed to receive the new headphones and write a new review based on a truthful experience. The customer experience person then told me they would only ship the headphones if I FIRST deleted my review. I consider this kind of aggressive suppression of truthful reviews as a very unethical business practice. If they invested more in product quality and less in post customer experience and bullying, I would have given them a positive review to start with. Do not believe the positive reviews, they must be arrived at through unethical means because the product is very poor in quality. Please see credible reviews from CNET and others. You'll realize that apart from the many that get free stuff to say good things, this is a low quality product.",1,1,2018-12-19,1,4,0
"I just tried these out and so far I think the headphones are pretty alright. The sound quality is great, I think the noise-cancelling feature is pretty good. I'm trying out this pair and also SkullCandy's Crusher Wireless headphones, which is around $105-$150, to see which one I like better and here's what I've found:- SOUND QUALITY: The sound quality is pretty much equal among both pairs. They sound slightly different, but I can't tell which one sounds better to me than the other. The sound quality slightly decreases in COWIN's pair when the noise-cancelling feature is turned off, but that's easily fixable by simply turning the feature on.",5,1,2019-2-15,1,2,0

"I really wanted this item to work out. I had read multiple positive reviews and figured I'd give it a shot. The item is as described and it feels very comfortable around the ears and head. It was easy to pair and at first the sound quality was great, nice deep bass and clear sound. Unfortunately, after a few days of when the headphones automatically connected, the sound quality was really bad. The bass was still working but the rest sounded very muffled (like when aux cord is not completely connected). I tried everything to fix it, I removed it and re-connected it and made sure that the headphones were fully charged. I connected a different headset to make sure that it was not my device that was the issue. However the problem still remains. I really wanted to enjoy these headphones because of the great reviews but the sound quality is not there after only a short period of time.",2,1,2020-7-14,1,2,0
"I researched all the review sites, I read all the Amazon reviews. I've tried a few different models. I'm looking specifically for diverse headphones that don't sacrifice clarity for bass. I thought I could expect a good result from these, as Cowin seems to have a good rapport. First, I'll give the good.PROS: comfortable, wide ear cups. They sat quite naturally over my ears. The low bass notes punch through pretty well. They look stylish.",2,1,2019-2-7,1,4,0
"*UPDATED Review- August 2020*I originally purchased this in January 2020. You can see my original review below, where the microphone wasn't working. I was just recently contacted by Cowin's customer service with an offer to replace the defective headphones. They asked if I wanted a different model, which was nice, but I just asked for this same E7's with working mic.. didn't want to be greedy. They ended up sending me upgraded headphones that costs $100 more than my defective E7 set! They're black instead of the green color of the E7's, but they're sleek, lightweight, sound great and.. the mic works perfectly! Great customer service!! Thank you!",5,1,2020-1-12,1,3,0
"So far i have owned 3 different  kinds of bluetooth headsets, i must  say the  battery life of this headset  is unbelievable. Myself  i used  mind for 5 nights and 5days straight before i had to recharge the headset . I like  the fact  that when you charge it a red light will come on and when its done charging it turns  off  automatically. Really this  is a  great  feature because that way you will not damage the headset if you forget to unplug it .  Really of all the headsets i have  owned  i put this one at the top and yes I would recommend this headset to any one . I will not explain to you why you should void some headsets but I can say  i got  2 other kinds of headsets that i am not happy with . i did notice with this headset the range  is alot future than from the other ones i got ,the quality for material and sound are perfect . when battery is low it will tell you twice before it actually turns itself off . don't be afraid to get ahold of the saler for any reason they will get back with you to see what the issue is with your headset . keep in mind i did read all reviews on this headset before i bought it and you will notice there was 5 stars marked on  everything . you hardly ever see all stars checked off  on  any one item . this just goes to show you what kind of headset you are getting !! I give 5 stars  on  every thing this headset has to  offer !!",5,1,2020-5-26,1,2,0
I'm loving these head phones I brought them to workout with and i needed active noise cancellation and these do the job very well. The fit is great and the sound is even better. When I do get a call while in use no one complains that I sound muffled which was the case with other headphones I've had. So I would definitely recommend these headphones so far so good.Update: I have had these headphones for 3 months using them 4 days a week for 2 hours. And they are not holding up there is static and the sound is spotty they seem loose now I have to keep adjusting them the cushion is a little uncomfortable now those are small things i could have dealt with but when I can't listen to anything without it going out which causes me to have to rewind and listen again I had to get this issue fixed. So I go online to check the warranty and I see that this company has released an upgraded version of the E7 and renamed it E7 pro upgraded and I read the description because just like phone newer models come out but most of the time the numbers change. Reading the description it gives. I read where they have made improvement that match everything that I am having issues with down to the cushion so upon future reading I see there is a 18 month warranty so I figure they would say hey we apologize  that the older version was not reliable as promised in the description we have since improved and upgraded the E7 and fixed those issues we will send the upgraded headphone. THEY DID NO SUCH THING. They wanted to send me the same E7 that is currently having enough issues to warrant improvement and upgrades.  I asked why would I want the same headphone that basically will quit in 3 months when you have the same product that fixed the issues of the first product. Needless to say after 3 days of emailing seller a refund was giving.  I wouldn't recommend any company who would knowingly give its customers a replacement product that is already known for having issues when they know that they have a product where they fixed the issues of the first. these are not 20 dollar headphones I paid over 70 dollars I think that should be taking into account when your product only last 3 months. They refuse because the price for the upgraded version is 20 dollars more so instead of losing 20 dollars they would rather do a refund instead and lose 1 customer and a 5 star review.,1,1,2019-3-12,1,3,0
"We've been using these for several months now and recently took them on a 6 hour flight. I bought them for my wife and she loves them. Very easy to connect to her devices and for her that is saying something. She says the comfort level is very good, and quality of sound is also very good. Battery life before needing a charge is better than expected and uses a standard mini usb so we always have a cord laying around. Overall we are 100% happy with this product.",5,1,2017-5-3,1,2,0
"Two stars because wow, comfortable: Light, soft, well balanced.ONLY two stars because the first pair I received, I charged them up and turned on the Noise Cancellation (NC) mode, it was beautifully silent until I moved my head - and then I got bursts of white noise in my right headphone.",2,1,2018-5-10,1,8,0
"So, I was really looking forward to a good quality bluetooth headphone with noise cancelling tech that I could use at work during loud noise situations to listen to podcasts.  This just isnt the case, and here is why I claim that.1. The pause/playback, doesnt work on my phone ( I have a Google Pixel 2XL ) So, this means I have to pick up my phone ( much to my boss's dismay ), unlock my phone, open the podcast app, and find the pause buttom.  Not good.  How can something in 2020 not have this option worked out for all phones ( makes me wonder if it works at all ).",3,1,2020-2-6,1,2,0
"The quality of sound to me was reasonable, nothing special.  The quality of the microphone however, sounded like I was using one of those deliberate voice obfuscators, only this one was programmed to sound like Darth Vader.  I had a snippet recorded to listen back and it was unusable.Had to return the unit.",2,1,2020-5-30,1,7,0
"This product might fairly deserve a 2½-3-star rating based on sound quality. Since I'm no audiophile, I do not feel qualified to assess the relative quality of the sound produced...However, I bought this product MAINLY for the ""active"" noise cancelling feature. Unfortunately, the product doesn't measure up in this category. If you're looking for decent bluetooth headphones with moderate *passive* noise cancelling, this might be a good purchase for you. External sounds are definitely somewhat muffled with these headphones on. But this level of passive sound muffling does meet my needs.",2,1,2019-11-21,1,2,0
"I saw the most popular review and I got so excited to get these headphones! I'm not sure if there's been a change in design or something, but the Bluetooth on these headphones is spotty at best and completely non-functional at worst. I literally cannot use these as wireless headphones (which was my *one* requirement in my headphone purchase). I'm so, so, so disappointed.And this ain't user error, baby. I've connected multiple Bluetooth devices to my PCs and smartphones, including my previous pair of headphones that had no issues with connection or sound. I tried: un- and re-pairing the headphones; connecting headphones to different devices; trying different Bluetooth dongles; trying different environments to test interference; uninstalled and reinstalled drivers; uninstalled and reinstalled Bluetooth on my machine—nothing. Everything is just intermittent.",1,1,2020-9-9,1,2,0
"(Will edit when situation is resolved). I was quite excited to find these headphones- they were reasonably priced, had good reviews overall, and did not look cheap. They arrived quickly, UNFORTUNATELY the headphones were broken upon arrival. The right speaker does not work nor does the bluetooth option work. I gave it two stars for now because it is comfortable and the customer service seemed willing to work to fix the problem, waiting to hear back from them. Hope to get this fixed soon.(EDIT 1) 9/14/2018: After dealing with Cowin customer service and receiving a new product I'm going to bring it up to 4 stars. The headphones are working well, the sound seems to be well balanced between the highs and mids the bass is kind of struggling. But overall it is a great bang for your buck.  Now customer service was good,, they handled the problem quickly and efficiently.  Happy with the transactions.",4,1,2018-9-8,1,4,0
"UPDATE: I've updated my review to 5 stars after the amazing experience that I've had dealing with Corwin after my initial review. I'll be honest - I'd never heard of Corwin before. I bought these headphones based on the reviews/popularity/price. Headphones sounded ok and I had issues with the mic, so I made that initial review. The company then went out of their way to contact me (keep in mind, this was a 3star review, not a 1 or even 2) and they made the situation right. They sent me a replacement pair to make up for the under-performing first pair. And then a few weeks later, they sent a 3rd pair of ""new and improved E-7"" headphones with some updates that they made after hearing feedback from consumers, which is a pretty amazing thing to do. Corwin has gone from a company I honestly didn't know to a company that I now know stands behind their products and reputation and I would now easily recommend them to people. Good customer service goes a long way to me and the way Corwin fixed this issue was Grade-A all the way!ORIGINAL REVIEW: (3 Stars) I'm very torn on these headphones. The sound is not that bad. But the microphone is terrible. I got these to have video-calls for work and all of my coworkers complain about how bad the audio is. They say it sounds like I'm on a bad phone connection - it's very low and muffled. It might be this pair in particular, or it might be with where the microphone ""hole"" is located on the headset itself. They are relatively comfortable (I wear glasses) and the battery life has been pretty decent as well.",5,1,2017-6-1,1,6,0
I am re-writing this review after i contacted customer support from the ear swivel break and they immediately responded with a offer to fully replace free of charge or a $50 gift card. i still stand by my 1 star solely because you purchase a product not just the customer support and i dont know if it has amazing customer support because the product is so flawed. it pains me because the product lives up to everything other than god awful durability,1,1,2020-1-20,1,7,0
"Fell off my desk once, about a 2 foot fall, and broke. Very disappointed in the durability of product for how much it is. Other than that the product did operate as it was advertised, good quality sound and very good noise cancelling. Had for only about 3 months. Seller was very easy to work with, they replaced damaged item quickly. I am very happy with customer service.",4,1,2017-5-30,1,2,1
"I am not going into a lot of detail as so many of the other reviews have. They do seem to be very well built. I have not been able to try the noise cancelling in a noisy environment, so no comment on that. I am disappointed. To me, the number one reason to buy headphones is for an increased quality of sound over other in-ear or speaker options. My biggest complaint is the low-fi quality of sound. It is not very dynamic, kind of muffled and dull. Music has no sparkle or separation. In other words, instruments and voice, which occupy different frequencies within the sound curve, are all reduced to the same lower frequency within the sound curve. Based on the reviews, I expected the sound quality to be better than it is. I went into my iPhone music settings and tried to increase the treble, or decrease the bass, but it didn't have any effect on the headphones. I tried them on iMac and the sound quality was no different from my iPhone. The sound quality is not as good as my $5.00 imitation, wired earbuds, nor my inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds. If you are looking for a good quality of sound, look elsewhere.",2,1,2017-9-21,1,1,0
"I do veterinary MRI scanning remotely and use Skype and MS Teams many hours every day.  A couple of years ago I decided to move away from my beloved Turtle Beach PX22s into the wireless realm -- mostly because I needed to be able to connect to two facilities at a time and all the wiring was messy.  So, to ease into the process, I purchased a half a dozen wireless headsets priced under $100.  The Cowin E7s were purchased in July of last year and were the most comfortable of my wireless test headsets.  I also used them for a couple of cross-country flights and found the noise reduction to be very beneficial.Of the six wireless headsets purchased, the Cowins and a pair of non-ANC MPOW 059s were my ""go to"" headsets.  The MPOWs because their bluetooth connectivity range is incredible and the E7s because of their comfort.  When not flying I routinely take the MPOWs because they fit into a pocket in my two 17 inch laptop bag.  When flying, the E7s were the easy choice.",2,1,2020-5-29,1,4,1
"This is my first time buying these headphones, I read good reviews and got hyped about how good they must be. My first time using them I found myself having mixed feelings. I have a rather small head and the headphones are slightly too big for me, although because of that they cover my ears perfectly. As for the sound quality, I  found that they were really base-y, if that's your preference these will work just fine for you. The noise cancellation is okay, does it's job but not the best, which is fine considering the price. Be warned though, music will sound flatter and just a bit louder in NC mode than in Bluetooth mode, which I'm still iffy about. I also wish they could have had a better volume range. But over all I still enjoy them, I accidentally fell asleep in them and woke up feeling pretty refreshed since no loud noises woke me up. On the down side I was late to work lol. 7 out of 10 stars. Hope this helps :)",4,1,2018-11-10,1,9,0
"These are nice headphones for everything but volume control. Firstly, the volume up button in below the volume down button which is above. Secondly, the volume changes by jumps not a percent scale. It's 10,20,30,40... compared to 1,2,3,4....update!!!!!! 7/16/18",1,1,2017-9-8,1,1,1
"Really great headphones all-in-all. Superb active noise cancelation. Excellent battery life. Honestly I prefer listening to them in Bluetooth mode - WITHOUT active noise cancelation, because the bass is better and deeper. I also think the protein (ear)pads are incredibly comfortable, even after long periods of listening.  And after having a problem with my headphones and being used to terrible to no customer support from companies, it was a relief to work with COWIN who offered to ship me out a replacement in a breeze.  They/COWIN stand by their warranty/warranties, especially if you (have) register(ed) your product.  But even if you didn't, they will help you out as long as you have proof of purchase and a problem and are within the warranty timeframe.  Really great headphones by a really great company.PS: IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE COWIN E8 INSTEAD.  E7=Great Value Bluetooth Bass-knocking Headphones. E8=One Word, MASTERPIECE. [Totally worth the increased cost, but either product is good.  I own both. I thought the E7 were amazing, until I was introduced to the E8 (especially with the improvements in noise cancelation, both passive and active), and then... my mind was blown.  Big Fan. But yes, cost may be an issue, but if you can't get them and just need some good wireless headphones for cheaper, grab the next best thing- the E7.]",5,1,2018-1-13,1,9,1

I have had it for a week no work and really like it. The appearance is slick and modern. I like the leather quality on the ear cups and overhead area (soft). The noise cancelling feature is excellent once music comes on. Without music I can still hear people around me but it all fades away with music. I fully charged the better before initial use since instructed and haven’t needed to recharge yet. Haven’t used for steady long stretches of time so not sure of actual battery life but seems long enough. Bottom line it serves intended purposes of allowing me to focus and be productive.,5,1,2017-10-8,1,1,1
"Original review 45 days after purchase: These earphones are not as good as reviews make it to be. First of all, it hurt my ears. One hour wearing it and I want to take them off. And if you have a small earring - forget it.Second - volume returns to max every time you power up headset. Meaning, if you have it set to an adequate volume, it goes back full blast when it is powered up next time. At times, I could not adjust the volume at all. Third, the volume controls stopped working after 32 days of using it for 5 hours every day. Now its volume is on max and hell it is loud.",2,1,2019-12-30,1,4,0

One ear piece keeps dangling; I keep pushing it back in, yet it continues to react to gravity and begin to dangle.The Pro: They are comfortable on the ears, if hot.

"I love these headphones in general - they have everything I was looking for in a pair of BT headphones. Most important to me is the comfort: the ear cups are big and soft so go all the way around my ears and I can wear them for hours with no issue. An added bonus is they keep my ears warm when it's cold out. The sound quality and noise cancellation are good too, though I'm not terribly picky as long as it's acceptable - I primarily use these for my bus/walking commute. There are three major downsides to them, however:1. The swivel mechanism will always catch my hair if it's down and keeps ripping out strands. This hurts and is very annoying.",4,1,2019-12-1,1,3,0
"These headphones quit working about 2 days ago. The blue light no longer comes on, and the headphones don't take a charge. For 70 bucks, I cannot say I'm pleased. I would not recommend these to anybody, and no, the noise cancelling does not work, although it drains twice the battery power there is no difference in noise from ""BT"" to noise cancelling settings on the head phones. It's a complete farce, and kind of like the the emperor's new clothes. Just because this manufacturer is telling you that noise canceling is taking place does not make it so.

"I bought these Headphones November 2017 and they are amazing headphones, great sound, good comfort, amazing battery life, but as of a last month they stopped working the way they should've. the plastic around the bridge of the right ear cup  broke off and the battery life dropped to almost 2 hours, causing me to buy the HE8 [which I will review after I write this] and the right ear cup just kinda flaps in the wind. 1 thing that was annoying when they did work, was that the vol up and vol down buttons are switch from other headphone brands, vol up is the bottom button and vol down is the top button, i always had to reset my brain when i came back from work using my skullcandy and my Anker earbuds. Other then that their great headphones. 4 stars because nothing is perfect, wish instead of the weirdly loud audio beeps to tell you when its on/off, disconnected/connected, and low battery it had a soothing persons voice like skullcandy bluetooth earbuds.",4,1,2018-11-20,1,4,0

"After reading and watching YouTube reviews for these headphones, I decided to order a pair and give them a try.  I've been in the market for headphones to replace my first gen. Beats by Dre that I used primarily for commuting to and from work.  The E7 is packaged nicely and it paired extremely fast with the NFC feature.  They are not heavy at all, but do not feel flimsy.  The ear cushions, which are made of ""protein""? (an animal that's not a cow I assume) are very cushy.  Also the headband is made with a very cushy material.  They feel great on the head and on the ears.  Although I have not worn these for more than an hour at a time, it felt as if I could wear them all day without any problems.  The swivel ear pieces make it easy to wear around your neck when you're taking a break.Battery life is great.  I've had these a week and I have not had to charge them yet.  The material is hard plastic.  I thought that maybe the chrome portions of the headphones would be metal, but they are not.  That being said, although they seem to be well built and sturdy, I would not recommend these for kids, someone who is accident prone or an extremely active person.",4,1,2018-11-30,1,2,0
"On a recent flight, it came to my attention that I really needed to invest in a pair of noise-cancelling headphones.  I was trying to watch a movie on my tablet using plain ol' ear buds, and I could not hear a thing over the noise of the airplane engine. I had to resort to watching a foreign movie with subtitles so I could at least read the dialogue. I did a bunch of research  and ultimately chose these. They were definitely the right price and had good ratings. I've been using them for a few months now, and I love them. They fit all of my needs. They are well-priced, they fit comfortably over my ears for hours, they sync easily with my all of the devices I've tried to sync it with, and the sound is fantastic. I have worn them in high-noise situations, and I was surprised at how well they work to block out ambient noise.  They even have handy controls right on them, so I can easily adjust the volume. I don't use them all the time, but when I do use them, it's for hours at a time and I have never had an issue with the batteries. I did get the corresponding COWIN case for them, as the drawstring bag these come with is laughable to protect them, and I'm glad I did.  Overall, I really couldn't be happier with these headphones and I highly recommend them.",5,1,2019-2-12,1,2,0
These may average 4.3 from reviewers for $69 but the $300 Sennheiser's (average review 4.0) totally blow these out of the water. Sennheimer's embed you in the performance; these headphones just skim along the surface. There's a deep price bias to all Amazon reviews - value for the money - that causes us to lose sight of the fact that you get what you pay for.I've been using these for several months now. They're far more reliable than the Sennheiser's and the sound is just as satisfying once you become accustomed to them. Landmark purchase when the $300 headphones blow up every two years.,4,1,2018-9-16,1,4,0
"*************Update**************I contacted customer service and was able to get a replacement unit. Let me start by saying customer service is awesome and had a replacement within an hour of me contacting them! The replacement unit works WAY better and is closer to what other reviewers have received. Bluetooth connected quickly and stays connected. The ANC is good, not as good as Bose of course, but good for the money. I have a loud fan thatnit is able to eliminate. I am taking a trip on an airplane in a couple of days and I know these headphones will be a lifesaver.  I like that these headphones have a lot of bass as well. Overall for the price these are good headsets as long as you get a good unit. I like the fact that I know that their customer service is excellent!",4,1,2017-9-19,1,5,0
"I purchased these for two reasons, to get away from some really expensive yet tethered headphones (think Senheiser and Grado) which sound awesome - and to try a pair of bluetooth headphones for quality.The second reason is to allow me to complete some studying even with a tv and a two year old non stop boy running amok.  They work!!  While it didn't make the two year old settle down it sure as frog feathers shut out the sound completely.  Audio is really good quality, the bass surprised me - it's quite good.  These are brand new tonight so I've not had time to pick out an appropriate musical piece quite yet to hear if I can differentiate between musical instruments in an orchestral setting.  All that stuffiness aside they are super comfortable, seem on the outside to be very good quality, sound quality seems at the outset to be excellent, If other reviews are correct battery life is supposed to be exceptional.  I did purchase as a set the hard case with them.  Nice case and they fit snugly but will be protected.  I think these to be worthy, if anything changes I'll update the review.  Not sure you would go wrong with this purchase.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
"My son used these for one month after Christmas.  Suddenly, they quit connecting through Bluetooth.

"The headphones weren't especially comfortable, nor did they have good noise cancelling nor sound quality - as compared to other headphones in a similar (or slightly better) price point.

"If anyone  knows who Johnny Guru is, I review products the way he does.Noise cancellation: There are 2 modes, BT and NC. I thnk the BT means Bluetooth and the NC is Noise Cancellation. The BT mode is the mode I use because  the NC mode sounds like an old VCR in the background and is quieter with no extra noise cancellation. The BT mode is still cool because I can barely hear my loud powerful PC. I recommend you stick with the BT mode on your headphones. For this category, I will rate this 5/5.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,2,0

"I bought these for my father who is in his 70s and has to go to dialysis multiple times a week.  He was always complaining about how loud it was with all the machines beeping, people talking (and unfortunately yelling).  He is stuck in that chair for hours at a time but had trouble sleeping or focusing on what he was doing on his computer.  He absolutely loved these headphones.  He used them every time he went to dialysis - he said they were great for keeping the noise out and allowed him to listen to music or watch videos on his computer in peace.  Unfortunately, they broke after only a few months despite him being super careful with them.  The part where one ear piece attaches to the headband broke.  We tried taping it, gluing it . . . it didn't work because the ear pieces swivel.  While the wire was not cut and sound still came through, it was impossible to wear.  When I contacted customer service they immediately agreed to replace the pair, no questions asked, even though I didn't buy the warranty.  He was so happy to get them back.  I was worried that the new pair could have the same issue so I bought him the hard case and I bought the warranty, just in case.  I'm so glad I did, because the new pair ended up breaking in exactly the same way.  I contacted customer service and they said they would replace them again (I had the warranty by that point so there was no question there).  However, I explained the situation and said I was concerned that the headphones would just keep breaking.  They offered to upgrade the pair at no cost to their E7 Pro version.  I was so shocked -- I wasn't expecting that at all.  I guess I just wanted to have it ""on the record"" that there was a defect in case the headphones did break again.  They shipped the E7s straight to my dad and he was over the moon.  He loved how they linked up with his laptop without him having to do anything and he said they sounded awesome.  He's only had them about a month and a half so we'll see how the new ones hold up but I couldn't be happier with the customer service.  My dad didn't want me to keep spending money on headphones and to him these are really a luxury item so it was nice that he didn't have to feel bad when he got his replacements and he truly appreciates them.  As for sound quality/noise cancelling I can't really comment as he's no audiophile but he said they're comfy and they do exactly what he needs them to do.  Very pleased with the purchase despite the hiccups.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0

"I bought these to use for air travel. When we received them we were sufficiently impressed with the sound that we ordered another pair of E7 headphones. Unfortunately I goofed on the order and got a pair of non-noise canceling E7s (I did not realize there was such a thing).  Since we were leaving on a trip in a couple of days we decided to do a side by side comparison and see how much difference the noise cancellation actually makes.The noise cancellation does make a significant difference. However, the noise cancellation only works in wired mode, not in Bluetooth mode. Secondly the noise cancelation only seems to work if you are playing sound, not when there is silence. While the noise cancellation does not eliminate all of the background noise, it does noticeably reduce the drone of the airplane engines and makes listening to music or a movie on an airplane noticeably better than listening with the E7 headphones that did not have noise cancellation. Since we purchased these headphones specifically for air travel, we will be returning the E7 non-noise cancelling headphones and buying another pair of E7s with noise cancellation.",4,1,2019-10-30,1,1,0
UPDATED - 1/13/2020 - These worked great for a few months and then picked them up and they were broken. As you can see in the pic the plastic is pretty bad. I am surprised they lasted this long. I am really suprised that piece is just cheap plastic at this price. Do not recommend.These seem to be great headphones for the price but I would not call them active noise canceling.  When you turn them on you can't hear them do any cancellation like you can with Bose or others.  DO NOT buy these if that is what you are expecting.  These are mufflers for the outside world and good headphones.  Other people have clearly not tried real noise canceling headphones if they are giving these high ratings on that one point.  The $300 Bose ones I tried before literally cancel out all noise.  These are not those.,1,1,2019-9-7,1,2,1
"Of course it's all subjective, but the COWIN E7 headphones are good general purpose headphones at a better than average price. The bass is a bit boomy at times without breaking up, but not boomy to the point of distraction. Subtle music volume variations are smooth and, thanks to good ear cushion design, nothing is lost. Comfort is outstanding. Noise cancellation is not one of its strong points, as described in other reviews. In one respect the volume button design is the opposite of intuitive, with the volume decrease function physically located above the volume increase function on the right ear panel. It is a dual function button, combining volume with track advance/repeat, a nice way to eliminate touch control confusion.  Bluetooth pairing with my desktop computer is consistently reliable and automatic after the first time, but walking around the room or to another room causes signal breakup. Moving around while seated at my desk is no problem for signal continuity. Overall, the COWIN E7 is a well priced headphone that should please most users in the under $100 price range.",5,1,2018-11-2,1,2,0
"The sound quality on these was disappointing. The treble is very muted and the bass is way too heavy. Some people may think it's fat, I suppose you could say that it is, some people may like it. But I think it's muddy and overdone. Believe me I like bass, which is why I have subwoofers on my different sets of speakers in the house. I also use uncolored monitors in my home studio, so too much coloring of the sound doesn't work for me. However they went too far the other direction with upper range, the highs are not crisp and clear in these headphones either.Another major issue, is the god-awful buttons. There's a 3 selection switch that is off, BT which is on, and noise cancelling. So you run the risk of switching the noise cancelling back off to get to the middle selection which is BT on, and accidentally switching to off, and and having to reconnect Bluetooth, as it takes some effort to move the switch specially when you're wearing the headphones.",2,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
I bought these in July 2018 and an ear piece completely broke off by mid-February 2019. I contacted the company that sold us the extended warranty and they told us that it wasn't their problem until the product was out of the manufacturers warranty. I contacted the manufacturer twice via email and haven't heard back on either using the email from their website: support.global@cowinaudio.com.

"I'll say this - they're reasonably comfortable.But the sound quality is really awful. It's sort of OK for talking to someone, although even there these sound distinctly worse even than the other cheap headphones I have. But they're absolutely awful for listening to music: just as mushy and gross and flat as I've ever heard. I'm no audiophile, and for $50 or whatever I'm not looking for high quality sound.

Our riding mower is very loud, and it's very hard to hear my music with just regular earbuds.  These work very well to reduce the mower noise and also let me hear the music.  Lastly, I wanted them to use the next time I took a trip via air.  I did that a few weeks ago and they worked great!  So much more comfortable than in earbuds!

Their customer service is phenomenal and the E8 version is great!These headphones are reasonably priced so my expectations were not very high. Unfortunately I tried them at the gym today and when I got more than about four paces from my phone, they cut out repeatedly. They even disconnected twice. I guess they’d be fine for a plane ride or office where your phone is next to them. I also didn’t care for the sound quality at all, very muddy. Fine for podcast or audiobook. I’ll be returning them.",5,1,2019-1-1,1,4,0
Took a chance on this unknown brand 2 years and 4 months ago and I dont regret it one bit!  I cant bring myself to plop down 3 bills on over hyped Bluetooth headphones therefore I let my wallet do the talking!These things have decent range as expect...arund 30 ft. They get fairly loud without distortion even at max volume! Persons around me can hear what I'm rocking out to if I blast em. They feel sturdy and look nice. Build quality is damn good at the under $100 price point. I could get 5 of these for one pair of beats by Dre over the ear phones! These things are suuuper comfy and durable. Ive had em in minor rain showers nothing happened. Left them outside in 40 degree cold. Dropped them from a cpl feet up a couple dozen times and they JUST. KEEP. PLAYING. Battery life is amazing....over 12 hours even to this day. I actually never clocked them.. Why should I?,5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"I purchased these as a combo order with the E7PRO.  This version came in a box with a dinged corner, and the metal side tabs look discolored.

I am able to play my iPhone voice memos through Bluetooth, but the AUX cable does nothing.  After 3 emails to the seller over a 5 day period,  I have gotten no response.  They send a nice card with the product touting their customer service.  Unfortunately, I have gotten none.  I am returning these for an exchange, as I think they are defective.  The E7 PRO works fine.  UPDATE:  Cowin responded to my review.  They are making it right and are exchanging the product.

"First off, let me start with the good stuff: its very comfortable and has a long battery life - for me it easily lasted for several days with many hours of use each day (this is over the last 5 months of use since I got them). That, coupled with the very comfortable, non-ear-pinching way they sit on my head, would have automatically earned a 5-star rating from me, especially given the decent sound quality and price.However, the actual mechanical build seems to be of quite poor quality. The left side broke at the swivel (see pics attached) - just came loose and now its basically useless! And that too within a few months of use. That knocks down all the stars unfortunately.",3,1,2019-1-20,1,3,1

My use of these was for the home-office, to minimize distractions from the usual house-hold background noise.

"UPDATE 8/4/18 - I've owned these headphones for about a year.  While it might not be the all around best sound you can buy, for the money you can't beat it!  The battery life is impressive.  I use the headphones quite a bit and I'll go days without charging it.  The sound is pretty good but the noise canceling isn't all that great but that's not what I use it for.  So after using these headphones for over a year, I'm moving my rating to a 4 star.  Great value but keep in mind it won't be the premium sound that others offer for $200+.  It's a good every day headphone, long battery life and solid sound.  It was a great buy!I was in the market for some premium headphones and was ready to purchase but then I came across the Cowin E7.

"Originally I was looking for Bluetooth earphones (I won’t mention the particular brand, but you can probably guess they’re the expensive kind). I happen to see these and right away I was taken back by the almost 9,000 reviews and 4 1/2 star rating!!!! Literally the price was the 2nd detail I looked at!!! 9,000 people can’t be wrong! I always check reviews before purchasing.Back to my story...I bought these to use around the house. We have 5 kids, ages 5-20 so it gets pretty loud around here, and sometimes I just need to find my Zen :) (and sometimes my sanity too). I ordered them in black although I originally wanted white. When I received them 2 days later (I love my Amazon Prime!) the results were phenomenal. There is no excuse for spending extra hundreds of dollars when the sound & quality is conveniently made for the regular working woman/man at a price that is more than affordable. So I had to share this experience with my husband and gifted him the headphones (I knew there was a reason I ordered them in black). He’s using them to go to and from work. He has a long ride on the subway and the bus, and living in NYC makes the noise just that much LOUDER!",5,1,2019-8-7,1,1,1
"These headphones are sturdy and comfortable. The build-quality is really impressive and the packaging was fancy. The sound quality is extremely good for this price range and I am happy with listening to music or podcasts. The bass is just right for me, but some may think it is a little light. For headphones it is better than you could expect.AS FOR FIT/FEEl: These are the most comfortable headphones I have had. I am sure some of the super expensive ones are good too, but I have had several from this price range and a few that were about three times as much and these are the very best. They are wide enough if you have a big melon, like me, but snug enough that my wife can wear them on her notably smaller head.  The padding on the over the head crosspiece is nice and soft, but feels like you could accidentally rip it if you are overly rough with your electronics. To be fair, I have been using them a lot and have not been super careful, but mine is just fine.  My very favorite part about these headphones are the ear-cups. They are big enough to fit over my large ears without scrunching them up. I also wear glasses and the pads make a good seal without making my glasses uncomfortable.",4,1,2019-9-19,1,1,0

The biggest issue I had was the internal mic was not up to par, the person on the other end of the call always complained they could ""hardly hear me"" so I then just resigned to use it for the purpose of noise canceling and pairing for music with my phone.  The fist pair ended up having one ear piece snap off so the company sent me a replacement pair with the agreement I take down my less than '4 star' rating.  I complied in order to receive the replacement headphones.***UPDATE*** replacement headset are the same model and brand, therefore I am having some of the same issues already and it has only been about 2 months since I received them in the mail.  The biggest issue is the right ear is making scratching noises, which is quite irritating, this happens mostly when I switch the functionality from the noise canceling feature to the Bluetooth feature.

"Save your money! I bought these headphones because they were affordably priced + had amazing reviews on Amazon, but now I see there's a reason why they're so cheaply priced and the reviews are likely fake reviews. I bought these headphones in August of last year. About 4 months later, I experienced my first issue with them. They flat-out one day STOPPED working. The sound just....stopped. I emailed the company and they sent me another pair free of charge. Awesome! I figured it was a glitch. Maybe I just had a defective pair. NOPE! Fast forward another few months, and they are already acting up again! Lots of static noise, randomly fading sound, etc. I can already tell they will stop working any moment now altogether. When I purchase headphones, I expect for them to work AT LEAST a year....definitely more than 4-5 months at a time. DO NOT waste your money on these...splurge a little extra on some actual QUALITY headphones!",1,1,2020-6-29,1,1,0
"I want to state that I think, for the price, these are perfectly good headphones. I realize that in not paying a premium, I should not expect premium performance. And so overall, I am happy with this purchase. But these headphones are not going to allow you to flip a switch and block out the noise in a coffee shop or other non-constant white noise.  The noise cancelling in these headphones is good enough to get rid of some white noise ""hum"" in the ambient background noise, but that's about it. Their other noise cancelling properties come largely from an earmuff effect - they physically block noise because they are large, over-ear headphones.  What this means for me is I can put these on in a noisy coffee shop and knock the noise down enough where I don't have to blast music into my brain to be able to work - which is a more pleasant way to work. But without music on, I am still in a coffee shop, listening to a dozen conversations, and having difficulty focusing.  So if you want headphones that take the edge off just enough to listen to music at a reasonable volume in a crowded place, these will do just fine. If you are expecting to flip a switch and mute the world, these will not do the job.",4,1,2019-6-11,1,2,0
"At the age of 65 with hearing aids, ear buds are practically useless because I have to take out my hearing aids to put the  ear buds in. Think about that. That's like taking out your glass eye so you can put on a pair of glasses to see better! I needed a pair of headphones that would be 1. Comfortable enough to wear for extended periods while wearing my hearing aids, and, 2. build and sound quality that at least matches what you paid for the headphones. As far as comfort goes, these are the most comfortable headphones I have worn to date. The sound quality is great for me and I'm half deaf:) Because I can keep my hearing aids in I can hear the full range of frequencies and they sound great. When I put them on, the room goes quiet and all I hear is the music or video coming through the headphones. I read many of the reviews prior to purchasing this set of headphones from 5 stars to 1 star. The 4s and 5s all had the same things in common, great sound and quality for the price. The 1s and 2s all had the same things in common, built cheaply because they broke within 6 months or a year. Overall and taking all things into consideration, if you are the type that is rough on your stuff, don't get these. Go out and buy a 4 pound rock solid set of headphones that you can drop from a plane or drive a truck over. I you want a pair of headphones that sound great and are decent quality, these are for you. BTW, all the customers that complained about the headphones breaking or not working within a year. Why don't you contact the seller? They warranty the headphones for 18 months, except for I imagine neglect or abuse. Here is their email.  cowinservice@163.com  I love the reviews that tell about a problem, contact the seller and then report back the results. Everybody loves good customer service so if a product fails, at least give the seller an opportunity to make it right and report that so that we buyers know what kind of service to expect. That's an important part of the buying decision process. Thanks",5,1,2019-2-16,1,3,0
"Let me preface this by saying I have never bought nor heard sound from any other noise cancelling headphones so I don’t have much to compare this to. That being said, I bought these for a long flight to China. In the past when I’ve flown, my ears have hurt from both my normal earbuds and also from having to turn the volume up so I can hear over the normal sounds of the plane. I experienced neither of these things with these headphones and I would say I wore them for probably 8 hours on each leg of my flights. As for the noise cancellation, both my husband and I were shocked at the difference when the noise cancellation is active vs inactive. It’s pretty powerful in my opinion. I thought my ears would hurt from having them covered, but that didn’t happen either. One charge before each of my flights and I didn’t run out of battery in the approximately 8 hours of use each way. Highly recommend! Not to mention, the purple is cute and just a vibrant as in the photos. The only thing I would say is that I recommend getting a case for them. They come with a drawstring bag, but the bag seems a little to small to fit the headphones.",5,1,2018-5-17,1,2,0
"These are kept in my desk and only used during the work day while sitting at my computer, so the pieces should not be breaking off. I bought these about a year ago and within the first few months the ear cover on the right side cam off the head piece. It was only attached by the wires. I taped that side because you can't wear them when the earpiece is disconnected like that. Then, a few more months pass and the other side has done the same thing! They still work but the ear pieces should not be falling off for the amount of money paid for them. They noise cancellation isn't the greatest, but since I'm using them in an office, it's ok because it's usually pretty quiet. I should have had these for years, instead it's been less than a year. Very disappointed and would not recommend.",1,1,2019-8-15,1,2,0
"I purchased these as my other headphones bit the dust. These arrived in solid packaging and are pretty hefty. The shiny plastic is kind of tacky but they seem solid nonetheless. Great battery life and passive noise cancelling is amazing because I cant hear a thing when I have these on and playing music. The active noise cancelling mode doesnt really seem to do much so I really just use them as bluetooth headphones. They have good range from bluetooth device and good sound quality but are a tad bass heavy so you lose a little treble. They have very comfortable ear cups and a nicely padded head band.Pros: solid, good battery life, good bass, good passive noise cancelling, good range",5,1,2020-3-3,1,1,0
"I received these and returned them on the same day! First, I plugged in the charger cable and the charge indicator light did not light. I tried another cable and it still did not light. My TV does not have BT so I Plugged in a 3.5mm cable and audio came through. According to the instructions the headphones should not work while the headphones are charging?The description says ""Deep Bass""! It is so deep that normal speech is so overpowered and sounds muffled and un-natural.",2,1,2020-8-23,1,1,0
The first thing I noticed right off the bat is that the ear cups were too small. They were pressing uncomfortably on the edges of my ear and was not something I could get used to.  I don't know what this noise cancelling feature is all about but the only thing I noticed is it would boost the high frequencies a bit. I don't see how changing the equalization a small amount qualifies as automatic noise cancelling. Also there was an emphasis on the mid range frequencies that gave my video games a muffled sound that was way too distracting. The blue tooth connectivity was quick and easy and the controls seemed fine. I don't think I have particularly ;large ears but others my find them perfectly fine. As always YMMV. The deal beaker for me was the fit that proved just too uncomfortable.,2,1,2020-8-16,1,1,0
"I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing these headphones are for the price.  They can definitely stand toe to toe with Bose in terms of sound quality.  They sound exactly the same as the $350 wired Bose headphones I use for private listening on my Roku. Great headphones for listening to the music!  Active noise cancelling silences ambient sounds.  The ONLY thing Bose does better, is block out noise from loud neighbors.  My upstairs neighbor stomps like an elephant and my Bose headphones tune out the high decibel noise of stomping completely. The Cowin E7 muffles the sound, but doesn't eliminate it completely.  But that aside, if you are just using the noise cancelling feature for music and not for stomping neighbors, Cowin is just as good as Bose for less than half the price.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0
"These headphones are junk, they lasted 4 months before the first earphone broke off of the headset. I repaired this and a month the second one fell off. If you  are interested in buying these you might check the return policy first from Cowin and Amazons  return policy. If sending them back to China is acceptable and you are OK with shipping fees buy  your self a pair, one to use and one as a spare for while the first pair is being repaired under there short warranty. They have a 11 percent customer dissatisfaction one star and two star. That is awful in my opinion.",1,1,2019-3-29,1,4,0
"I was very pleased with this product.  It paired easily and effortlessly.  Sound quality was very high and with the Noise Cancelling Function operating I could use my riding lawnmower and listen to Podcasts and not even turn the volume all the way up.  I was so pleased I had started to toy with the idea of buying a second pair so I had one for home and one for work.  They were working great until I turned off my BT on my iPhone 7 without disconnecting the headset first.  Since then they do not work.  I toggle the switch back and forth but they never make the tone to let me know they are coming on or pairing to my device.  According to Amazon I was eligible for support until July 1, 2019 and it is July 3, 2019 that this happened.  Planned obsolescence?  If there was a reset button or reset directions and I could get them to operate again I would be once again very happy with them.Update: I turned the switch to noise cancelling and left them to sit until the battery died.  Took 4 or 5 days. Charged them back up and they worked normally.  I am still very pleased with the product.  The only issue I have is there is not a reset function and this would be especially helpful with a product that doesn’t like to be abruptly unpaired with devices.",1,1,2019-7-3,1,1,0
"The Cowin E7  are decent mixed usage headphones . This model improves the battery life and sound quality of the originals but also loses a bit of thump in their bass. They have a slightly more premium look, but it's mostly cosmetic, as their design and overall performance do not change much. They're a decent and affordable option for commuting but aren't the most durable or comfortable headphones in their price range. the plastic used for the ear cups feels low grade and a bit flimsy. They won't break from a few falls, but the ear cups and hinges do not feel as durable as some of the other budget headphones. They have a consistent, balanced, and punchy bass, a good and relatively balanced treble, and great imaging. However, they lack a bit of sub-bass so they can't produce a lot of thump and rumble, and their mid-range tends to sound thin and honky, especially on vocals. Additionally, their treble may sound a bit sharp on S and Ts, and like most other headphones, they don't have a speaker-like soundstage. They cancel enough ambient noise to use for regular commutes especially when playing your music at moderate to loud volumes. They also do not leak as much as much as some of the other closed-back over-ears, which make them an above-average option to use in quieter conditions. However, at high enough volumes, they will be audible to the people around you, and their somewhat decent isolation won't be enough for particularly noisy environments. The integrated microphone of the Cowin E7  is sub-par. In quiet environments, speech recorded or transmitted with this mic will sound relatively thin and noticeably muffled and lacking in detail. It may also sound a bit unnatural and difficult to understand. In noisy situations, it will struggle to fully separate speech from background noise, even in moderately loud places, like a busy street.",3,1,2019-1-26,1,2,0
"Although the headphones seem to work via Bluetooth just fine, the active noise cancelling causes you to hear loud feedback with each step. Although the general sound quality over Bluetooth and via the 3.5 mm aux Jack does work, the headset does not have the ability to allow microphone inputs when connected via the auxillary cable. This is a feature that a reasonable person can assume is supported as no publicly available documentation, including the instruction manual; makes clear.When contacting the chat support from the manufacturers website, I was greeted by the automated system and asked what the issue was. It took a bit of time to have an agent respond with a greeting which is understandable. What is not acceptable was that it took 20 minutes exactly to have the agent respond even after 5 minute intervals of attempting to verify that the agent was still present. After explaining my concern of the functionality 3 different ways in order for clarity on the agent's side, I was met with a response that the agent would have a manager contact me during their operation business hours to ""fix"" the issue. Upon questioning how they might fix this issue, the agent replied that they would be fixing the operation manual to reflect that this was not a feature. After explaining to the representative that I did not want to participate in that interaction and would rather have the product returned for a refund, the agent provided the relevant information to proceed. At the conclusion of this interaction, I requested that the agent provide me with a means in which to aquire a copy of our interaction. The agent replied that they would need additional time in which to inquire on how to accomplish this task. After but 5 minutes, and without providing any other information or response, the agent disconnected the chat. At this disconnection, there was no way to further contact the agent, reinitiate a new chat, nor rate the agent. I am hoping that I am able to return the product and will not be purchasing any other products from this company in the future.",1,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"I've had these headphones for about 2 months & really like them. Excellent sound quality. Use them to listen to music, recordings of classes or programs, YouTube videos and more. Crisp sounds and very clear.  I've worn the headphones for 6-7 hours at a time and I've never had a headache (I have from other headphones); nor did I need to charge them!  The bass quality is better than other headphones I've purchased but if bass is enhanced, I'd give the headphones 5 stars for everything. I wanted noise cancellation and it works well. Initially thought the specific purpose was to reduce ambient noise around me when I'm not using audio. It certainly helps in that regard, but does not eliminate the noise (not supposed to). I need to use the headphones more on the noise cancellation mode to give a fair rating.  I'm very happy with these headphones and are my favorite of all my previous headphone purchases. Thanks for a great product!",5,1,2019-7-29,1,2,0
"There are only a few purchases that I make a year that really give that ""wow"" factor. With Bose, Beats and other brands charging $300+ for headphones I wasn't sure I would ever be in the ""noise canceling headphones"" cool kids crowd. I'm frugal and I just can't justify spending that much on a set of headphones. But I can justify less than $100 since I spend a lot of time on planes and I'm tired of watching movies on my iPad with all that growling in the background. So I gave the Cowin E-7 a shot. And boy did I get that ""WOW"" factor. It's actually more like a ""ZOWWWWEY"" factor. These are well made, have battery love that survived both legs of my trip from Connecticut to Los Angeles for a total of 13 hours with no charge and the noise cancelation is really amazing. At one point the plane was so smooth, and my headphones were so quiet, it was an eerie feeling to think I was 40,000 feet in the air and cruising at 500 miles per hour. Very, very, VERY happy. For what it's worth I bought the extended protection through Amazon so I'm protected for years to come.",5,1,2017-6-22,1,4,0
"I'm new to Bluetooth and Noise Cancelling headphones so I wanted to try these.  What you should know is that the noise cancelling and bluetooth connection work great.  The sound quality is ok but, the biggest negative for me was that when turned on, you can't adjust the sound  quality (i.e., treble, bass, concert setting, auditorium, etc.l) from the receiver they're plugged into.  It would have been nice if they just played as regular headphones when not on and then given me the option of using the noise cancelling if wanted.  When using bluetooth and/or noise cancelling, you're going to get sound from these headphones but, you can't make ANY adjustments to it other than volume.  The sound quality isn't bad . . . it's just that I would have liked to have a little more control of it.  If that's not a factor with you, then they're pretty good headphones.",3,1,2019-7-13,1,3,0
"I’ve owned these for 9 months and have used them for less time because they were a present that wasn’t gifted immediately. These have been used very lightly up until the past few weeks. Now, after just a few weeks of daily use they’ve kicked the bucket. The Bluetooth connection no longer works properly so I’ve had to return to using an older pair of Bluetooth headphones that these were meant to replace. I’m very disgusted that immediately after the warranty ended they died. Evidently these are meant to be cheap, disposable devices without the cheap price. I won’t be buying this brand ever again.",1,1,2020-7-11,1,2,0
"I work from home and spend a large part of my day on conference calls... so ear buds aren't an option as my ears will be killing me by the end of the day... so I went out a bought a $24.99 pair of J Lab headphones that served their purpose really well for a couple of years and  then finally died on me. There's NO way I'm dropping $300+ for a pair of Bose or Beats headphones so I spent $49.99 on these and COULD NOT BE HAPPIER. They are ridiculously comfortable, the microphone sounds great and it blocks out 99% of outside noise (in blutooth mode, I haven't tried the noise cancelling mode yet but I don't really need that function). I don't like bashing other products so I stay away from super negative reviews unless it's so bad I feel I need to warn other consumers... but I'm ashamed to admit I rarely take the time to praise good products but these are so worth it folks. They could probably charge $199.99 and they'd be worth it. I can almost guarantee you that you will NOT find a better pair of headphones for $49.99... much less $99.99 or even $199.99.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT PRODUCT... THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!",5,1,2019-8-5,1,1,0
"These headphones are so good that I could have been murdered while wearing them and never would have heard it coming! Of course, I mean this as the most glowing indorsement possible. My husband bought a $300 pair of Bose noise canceling headphones for a trip we were taking and didn’t buy me a pair. Jokes on him though, because I bought myself this pair for around $60 and mine work just as well. Also, mine have a nice flat surface on the ear coverings that is easy to personalize with vinyl or stickers, if you’re in to that...which I totally am. The other day I was wearing these while doing dishes at the kitchen sink when a friend of mine dropped by unexpectedly and let herself and her 4 year old into my house. They were both inside running amok and calling my name and I never knew it. She had to call me on my phone (which rang through to the headphones on Bluetooth) to find out where I was, since I wasn’t answering when she called out my name, her kid was in the room next to me and I didn’t hear a thing! Luckily, they were my friends and not axe murdering home invaders! So don’t wear these in a sketchy area where you need all your senses, or while running in a street where a car could sneak up on you.",5,1,2019-1-3,1,2,1
"I own Bose wired headphones and my Cowin E7's hang with them note for note. Great bass response and nice highs. The noise cancellation seems really good for what they cost plus no wires. I'm jamming to DIO while my wife is running the vacuum, can't hear it run. No complaints from. I was fixing to spend $300 more than what these coast on Bose. Thought I'd try these first, can always return them but I'm see no reason to and saved the $300 by keeping them.I fully recommend Cowin E7 noise cancelling headphones, I'm an audiophile folks, if I like I'm in you'll most likely love them, rocking to Pink Floyd as I your this on my cellphone.

For some reason after years of using earbuds I can no longer wear them My right ear gets raw and scabs up. I even tried the Apple ones. Seems anything touching it causes it. These go over the ear and I have been wearing them most of the day while I play on the computer. I love them because it blocks out all outside noises except things like a doorbell or the phone. They block out repetitive noises great! I use them about 6 hours or more a day and I'm on my 4th day without charging!The sound quality is excellent also! Very crisp and clear with no distortion. The Bass was a bit much for me but I adjusted it down a bit on my phone and they are perfect for me. I just wish I could find a way to hook them up to my TV so I could use them there too! I have a loud heater and when it comes on I have to adjust the TV up and then back down as it shuts off. With the headphones on I never hear the heater at all!,5,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"I have a coworker that sits 10 feet away from me that just doesn’t really understand office etiquette. If any music is playing, she will hum, tap her nails, drum, click her tongue, snap her fingers, tap her feet and even occasionally get up and clog... that’s right, clog!! I have slowly been losing my sanity over the last year of calmly trying to ignore her. A few times I mustered the courage to say “I think that’s enough drumming for the day” but nothing stops this girl!!! So finally, I ordered these headphones. I’ll be honest, I was one jig away from snapping and strangling her. But now, thanks to the Cowin E7’s I’m not in jail, I still have my job and my sanity! They block out the very loud whistles, every toe-tap, and every question I try to ignore. The day is now filled with nothing but beautiful music in my ears!! Sometimes I don’t even play music, I just have the headphones on for the peace. Buy these if you want to save your soul!",5,1,2019-8-12,1,1,0
"These are nearly unusable via Bluetooth.  They'll only connect after an indeterminate number of attempts at powering on.  The headset and stereo features conflict with each other so you roll the dice on having sound or microphone capabilities with each application that you run.  Generally they seem to cut out around 2 seconds after starting a video or anything new as Windows thrashes between the headset and stereo settings.  I could get past all of that if they didn't periodically cut out resulting in any audio becoming progressively more out-of-sync with visuals creating a nauseating experience.  The sound quality on the Stereo setting is pretty good if you ignore the problems though the sound quality on the headset setting is horrible, and that's the only one that has a functioning microphone.  Likewise, the 3.5 mm plug setup seems to work flawlessly for output (don't expect the microphone to work) but I didn't buy Bluetooth headphones to be tethered a foot from my computer.",2,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"Bought for longer flights as I travel for work frequently. These allow me to enjoy shows and music without the annoying, and sometimes deafening, drone of the engines. It suppresses the engine noise perfectly in my opinion. It's not silent when you wear them - voices of others can still be heard, but that's typical of most noise cancellation headphones, and it's certainly muffled. Super comfortable, but if you wear glasses, you may need to take short breaks. I've found they slightly press the arms of my glasses into the bone behind my ears, but it's not noticable unless it's been more than a couple hours.  For the price, you really can't go wrong if you're looking for an inexpensive way to make flying more comfortable.",5,1,2019-7-14,1,2,0
"I purchased this product for my teenage daughter. The headphones were a good value and she enjoys them and finds them easy to use, charge, pair with here phone, etc. She had them for almost 6-months and used them daily, to/from school, soccer practice, and more. They seemed to be holding up to abuse (bought a hard case that she never uses) and then one day the on/off (OFF-BT-NC) switch broke. It sort of recessed into the unit and we were unable to turn the unit off or use it.I contacted Cowin directly and withing 24 hours I received an email and code to replace the unit free of charge.

While I use them to listen to music at night to fall asleep to, I also use them during the day because I have a neighbor who's dog barks incessantly and there is major construction taking place next door. The noise cancelling feature works like a charm! It's made the days pleasant and tolerable again.  The battery lasts forever, and the headset is light - I sometimes forget I'm wearing them. Last but not least, whatever I listen to via these headphones sounds great! Clear, no distortion, excellent sound, including base. I am extremely happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-1-29,1,3,0
"Updated Review: 5 StarI wrote my original review the day after I received these from Amazon, immediately after filing for a return. The same day Cowin sent me a new ""upgraded"" pair at no charge with an apology letter and a more direct line of contact for continuing feedback. I was completely floored. An apology letter or an opportunity to help improve their product would have been largely unheard of by themselves - but both combined with a free replacement?! There can be no company more committed to customer service than this - and they deserve patronage for it. So if you are on the fence, at least give any pair of Cowin headphones a shot - they have many to choose from.",5,1,2017-7-2,1,3,0

Yes, I've owned others and wrote off bluetooth based devices because of the delay, which has been alleviated with the newer software. Although they don't recommend using these phones for transmitting from a guitar amp , I had to try it and they are correct. Don't go there.My head fit needs a very large headphone.

"After seeing the reviews on these headphones, I immediately purchased them thinking they would be a worthwhile investment for a decent set of noise cancelling headphones. I was mistaken.Sound - They crack and pop and warble out the extremes on both sides. It reminds me of the speakers in my grandfathers 1979 Ford pickup.. When I walk with them on they make this weird bubble noise, like the drivers are going in and out.",1,1,2019-12-31,1,2,0
"These headphones are comfortable & worked well for the first few months. Then they stopped charging. I thought it might be the cord, but it’s not. If I wiggle the cord around, I can sometimes get the red light to flicker, and if I’m really lucky, I can tape the cord in place and get a full charge, but more often, I don’t have the time necessary to mess with it.  Also, the design of the headphones (all black with no markings) makes it difficult to find ports.UPDATE: Customer Service at Cowin saw my review and contacted me through Amazon, offering an apology for my issues and a free replacement set of headphones. I never expected ANY response, let alone such a GREAT response! The new headphones arrived with no ""catch,"" making a believer out of me!

I reported a small port issue one day and 24 hours later I have a new set of headphones. These folks go way out of their way to ensure their customers come first. That's important to me.

I need a mic that produces a clear sound.I tested these (Pair A- cowin)  against the pair I was replacing (Pair B -logitech). Pair B, which has a loose head band, still produced a clearer sound. When listening through my monitor, my voice was crisp and clear with pair B. Pair A sounded muffled and the tick tock of my wall clock was heard. I turned on noise cancelation which did not cancel out the sound. I could not hear any surrounding sounds with Pair B - my broken headphones.

"I have no idea why these are such bestsellers and so well rated by many. True, they're cheap and are, in theory, equipped with active noise cancellation. In practice, they are flimsy, the sound is poor, and the active noise cancellation makes sound quality even worse. Everything just sounds flat and muffled. Also, whenever I turn on active noise cancellation I get a weird vibrating hum. Very annoying.If you really, really need active noise cancellation, get something by a better regarded company and be prepared to pay more.

"We have been in the market for a pair of Wireless headphones we can use with our iPhones and maybe our iPad and iMac. We were using wired headphones with our old landline and we finally decided to join the last century and eliminate the ""home phone.""  My wife likes to do chores in the kitchen while she chats on the phone and was forever getting tangled up with the wires. We bought another reasonably priced headphone on Amazon and returned it right away (thanks to Amazon's amazingly easy return procedures.) Those headphones never paired with Bluetooth and never worked. We tried trouble shooting to no avail. Enter Cowin which had predominately good reviews so we took a chance. They arrived beautifully packed, I kept the original box to use as a case even though an attractive bad comes with. They paired on the first try with both our iPhones and we have used them on some extended personal and business calls and they worked great. The noise cancelling feature is excellent (although you don't really have to use it, the comfortable snug fit tends to block out most outside noise anyway.) But with the noise cancelling feature turned on, we could not hear almost any outside noise (and we keep the balcony door open.) The people we have called say our voices are clear as can be, it took a bit of getting used to on our part since we always had one of those microphones that would twist around in front of your mouth so you could be heard. This built in mic works fine, just took getting used to the fact that we didn't need to shout! It is comfortable enough to wear for long 2 hour plus conversations and it adjusts to fit different sized heads. Battery is said to last without charging for 20 - 30 hours, but I tend to recharge once a week anyway. We have not yet listened to music so I can't comment on the sound quality for those of you looking for that feature. But as far as phone usage is concerned we are extremely happy. Note: it is a good idea to turn off Bluetooth on nearby devices when you are using on another one. We had some pairing issues when both iPhones had Bluetooth active, but Cowin's excellent customer service identified the issue and advised us immediately. Only issue we still have is answering via the headphones and not the iPhone itself. Not a biggie, but we need to learn. We've had these for a few weeks and once I've tried them for music and have used them for a longer period of time, I'll update my review. But for my purposes, they are very effective, comfortable and reasonably priced.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"Purchased the Black/Chrome for my wife. They are a work of art, beautiful rich design with chrome and slick black, you feel you just purchased a $350 pair of headphones.  The E7 sounds great and very comfortable with no fatigue factor after hours of wearing on treadmill. These are 5 star headphones for this price category. Only reason I give it a 4 star is a pairing issue.  The 1st Bluetooth pairing is a no-brainer, eazy peezy, virtually automatic and if you only have one Bluetooth device to connect with, no issue. I test paired it with my iPad first and then tried pairing with my wife's iPhone... Oops, but it wouldn't pair with with her iPhone6 (also no NFC on early models). Frustrated why I couldn't pair with the iPhone, I checked instructions and troublshooting, but didn't see any application. So, checked on-line with E7 blogs and unbeknownst to me, you can only pair with one device at a time with the headphones. (I did finally find this issue under ""Connect using NFC"" once I knew what I was looking for) I disconnected/removed the pairing with the iPad and it immediately paired with iPhone6.  Point is, you can choose one pairing to live with, else you will have to disconnect/delete a previous paired device before you pair with another device - this is probably a no-brainer for those who are experienced with Bluetooth, but did not highlight this in Troubleshooting section. It would be helpful if Instructions could make sincle pairing issue in bolded text for clarity.  Bottom line, these are 5 star great headphones for the price. Oh yes, the connect to a phone call works great on the iPhone.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I was really excited when I initially placed my order since I read all the amazing reviews. When I received them, they looked pristine and sleek but when I turned the headset on, the sound was muffled and the volume max was not loud enough (in my opinion).They also didn't fit since the ear pieces are smaller compared to my last headset, I saw some other reviews stating the same thing but thought I wouldn't have that problem. They also didn't fold like I expected, the ear pieces only turn sideways so its too big to fit in my laptop bag.",1,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0

They very comfortably & completely cover your ears to block out external noise while keeping the bass and highs contained. The dynamic range is very good & again, IMO impressive for the low cost. I've listened to everything from Mozart, country & rap to club music and I have to say I'm impressed all around!The noise cancelling feature is great to eliminate annoying external sounds that can interfere with your listening enjoyment. Again, it's not Bose quality but they only cost about 20% of what Bose do! I honestly don't use the feature very often because it's almost always quiet at my house.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I purchased 2 of these, my 16 year old son’s broke at the swivel in 3 months.  Mine, even with especially careful treatment, broke the same way a couple of months later.  I am out over $120 on these fragile headphones.  Out of hundreds of purchases, there is literally nothing on Amazon for which I have spent so much just to have it gone so quickly.  I am finally getting around to posting about this even though it has been a while since I was able to use these.  Maybe I will try some duct tape but in the meantime I am back to some over the ear mpow ones that are good for some external sound deadening just because they cover your entire ears.",1,1,2019-10-4,1,2,1
"I was excited to receive these headphones which had a very nice appearance and appeared well made.  But disppointment soon set in when I could not pair these headphones with my Apple TV or my telephone or my Win 10 notebook or anything at all.  Cowin, the manufacturer, gives a phone number on the manual for customer service.  Except they never answer the phone.  One has to submit an email and then they will allegedly call you back.  They did call back one time and they said they would send me an email outlining a method that I could exchange the headphones for their newer model.  I agreed to happily pay for the difference in cost and all shipping charges.  They never sent me an email.  When I continued to email them, they now did not return my emails nor call me.  There phone continues to ring without a response.  These headphones might be very nice if you are lucky enough to be able to use them but if you are expecting that the company would back up their obsolete product, you would be mistaken.  I would avoid purchasing anything from such an unreliable company.",1,1,2020-8-11,1,1,0
"Got these phones yesterday and have used them twice. I'm very impressed. It's my first experience with N.C. phones. I have not bought them sooner because most of the products I've seen are too pricey. When I saw these at under $60 I bought them... understanding that I might be disappointed.I am delighted with them. First, they are COMFORTABLE! The headband has sufficient adjustment for me to wear them over a ball cap and still have the ear cups completely cover my ears.  On my morning walk today... with temperature in the high 30s, my ears were nice and warm. Second, the NOISE CANCELLING function works beautifully. While I have no prior experience with N.C. performance, these phones impress me. I need to be careful because I cannot hear vehicles approaching me from behind while I'm walking. Nor can I hear any other sounds except the Pandora tunes playing. The SOUND is excellent. The bass is wonderful. I'd like a little more treble for contrast, but I'm being picky here.",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0

"I have loved these headphones for a year now since I bought them. They've worked great for music on my phone and for phone calls. However, now that I'm working from home full time I've tried to hook them up to use them with Microsoft Teams and it has been a horrible experience. People complain all the time that they can't hear me well even though I've checked and re-checked all of the settings. Now they won't connect at all even though they're paired with my laptop.  Awful. These are supposed to be an approved device for MS Teams but my experience has been the worst. I contacted customer service 2 weeks ago because I think they should replace them after such a short time but I didn't get any response so bad customer service on top of everything else. I'm now on the hunt for better headphones.  :(",2,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
"I use these headphones EVERY NIGHT.  I wear them while my husband watches TV shows I'm not interest in.  Drowns out most of the noise but I can still hear him talk to me.  Sometimes I fall sleep listening to podcasts or documentaries so they are on for hours.  Battery life has been good except lately I've noticed that after a day or so I hear ""please battery charging"".  Seems you can't use them and charge them at the same time.  Lately I noticed they are taking longer to charge.  Yesterday they were off, plugged in charging for 8 hours only to be at 57%.  Hope this isn't an issue.  I love these headphones.

"Just got these and will update 8/7/2020First impression: I love the color, they are super comfortable and sound wonderful.

My current ones cracked and are uncomfortable so it’s hard getting to sleep.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
"The Good: The noise cancellation is great. It does a good job of blocking out the everyday hum drum noises. The sound quality is also superb. Very full detailed sound and the battery life is great. The Bad: The overall volume capacity is very unimpressive to say the least. My $13 Bluetooth headphones get louder than these. My cheap headphones will go as loud as the phone will allow and you can turn it up past what the phone will allow, on the headphones themselves. These WILL not get loud at all or let you turn them up on the set themselves, past what the phone will allow. The Bluetooth also disconnects frequently. For long periods of time and for short intervals, so you often you hear every other syllable of a word. Very annoying. Very disappointing for the price.",2,1,2019-7-21,1,2,0
"The first thing that impressed me was the packaging. Well done. Once charged I set out to test these. First thing I noticed is the comfort of these on my head.

No issues at all.I bought these to replace a pair Bose NC headphones that were stolen. I was gun shy tonspend a lot of money on a new pair for fear they would get stolen. I have owned other headphones like beats, JBL and Sennheiser. The sound from these headphones is excellent. Bass and midrange are great in listening to music, movies and audio books.",5,1,2019-1-31,1,1,0
"I wrote a review about the same issue before but seems like it's been deleted. Hmm. Ok, here's another review for the replacement they sent me two years after the first one. I received the replacement last year and within about 6 months it started showing the same issue with mild use. I am assuming the material isn't good enough for the way people usually use them. The pads are cracking. The first one I got had cracked the same way then started peeling off and it would stick around your ears every time you use them. This time I simply stopped using them because I know what was going to happen again. Please do not send me any replacement because it doesn't live up to the basic expectation.

My ears are small so sometimes that translates to a pair of headphones working for someone (everyone!) else and not me.  But, the muffs on these really sculpt around my ears and fit perfectly.  The faux leather is also super duper soft against my ears and my head.  I literally wear these for hours on end sometimes!

"These headphones are very nice. I had a BOSE set for noise cancellation and they quit working after a year. I didn't take out the warranty, so bad on me.

"The most important aspect for a pair of audio headphones; the sound quality. These sound alright. Unfortunately alright equates to just average, nothing that stands out. They're plenty loud enough, but they don't sound particularly full to me. The bass isn't impressive, but it's adequate. I have heard headphones that sound better and some that have sounded worse. These are simply average.The noise canceling function works fine for me. I use it to block out the conversations of people or their TV watching and it handles that fine. Then again, you could just play some of your favorite audio through any pair of headphones to block out unwanted sounds, so for me noise canceling headphones should strive towards reproducing the impression of silence. In that regard, these headphones fail. They do not produce an ambiance of silence when using the noise canceling feature. It is much easier to ignore or 'over look' the external noises and sounds while wearing these, but that's not what I would call noise canceling. Perhaps I have a more focused, unrealistic expectation of the capabilities of this feature in general.",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

If you get a pair that don't break, these are awesome.EDIT: I contacted customer service since these were still under warranty, and they responded 5 minutes later with a code to get a free replacement for the 2018 upgraded version.

"I recently bought these headphones because I was headed to Vegas and the flight would be long, so I wanted something to help keep out the noise of the plane. Best decision I've made. These worked surprisingly well. There was an annoying child on the plane who kept speaking loudly and crying for the majority of the flight (you know the usual, the child who's damn parents refuse to tell them to shut the heck up)!! Anyway, once I realized what was happening, I took these bad boys out, put them over my ears, plugged in the a/v cord that came with them into the tv screen on the plane, and that was the last I heard of that annoying child. Moreover, the best part, the headphones blocked out the noise from the plane and also stopped my ears from clogging. I was extremely surprised by how effective they are.On a questionable note, I have used them on Bluetooth mode to listen to music and watch videos on my computer. I noticed that sometimes it drops the connection. I am not sure if that is an issue with my computer or the headphones so I will continue to monitor the situation. However, b/c I bought them for their noise cancellation abilities and b/c they work great in that regard, I am not lowering my rating for the Bluetooth issue.

It’s crazy bad. Squeak, squeak...",1,1,2019-9-30,1,2,0
"This is an initial review as I have only had mine for 3 days. First of all, some outstanding qualities: They are extremely comfortable. I wore them all day even when I was not using them just because I forgot I had them on. Second, the battery life is excellent. I purposely left them on the whole day I was away from my house. They lasted at least 14 hours before I put them on the charger for the night and were still going strong.Now for the more nuanced qualities. The Active Noise Canceling is plenty sufficient for listening to podcasts and music on the train and the subway. While it is not exquisite like the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II or the Sony WH1000XM3, it certainly does enough to allow you to turn the volume down a bit and to hear over the ambient noise of subways, trains, and traffic. If you are around some loud, low rumbling, like the engine of the train as it passes you, these headphones simply can't reproduce such vibrations. So, you will find your listening experience swamped by such noises. I suspect, though, that the more expensive phones would be hard pressed to filter out such noises as well.",4,1,2019-1-11,1,0,0
"I don't usually write reviews, unless something is very bad or very good.  These headphones have proven to be very good.  I tried a few other ones for gym use and none of them proved to work at noise cancelling.  I use them while I am on the stair master machine. The machine itself generates a lot of noise, the gym's own music is loud, and the noise from all the other machines and people.  These headphones block it all out so I can listen to the fine detail of the movies I watch while on the machine.  They have also been great a not being affected by the large amount of sweat I generate while exercising on the machine for 1 hour.  I would highly recommend them.",5,1,2017-5-29,1,5,0
"I have a pair of $300 Bose noise canceling headphones. They are  wired. I wanted a bluetooth pair of noise canceling headphones, but I didn’t want to spend another $300 on noise canceling headphones. After initial charging, I gave them a hour long test run. The sound quality was very good. When the Bose headphones are in noise canceling mode and before any audio is played, virtually no outside noise is heard. When the Cowins are in the noise canceling mode and no audio is playing, I can hear some outside sound. When I started the audio, I heard no outside noise. For a $60 pair of headphones, they do a great job. They are comfortable—no sore ears after 60 minutes of continuous wear. I would have given  a 4.5 rating if I could have. My Bose are better, but they are still $300. The Cowin cost $60.

"I have pretty bad anxiety sometimes, complicated by misophonia (bass sounds through the walls will make me feel like I'm going insane, way beyond rational reactions). So when we moved into our new house and found out a house that touches the corner of ours over the wall loves parties with loud spanish karaoke it was a problem. Not only was it impossible for me to try and cope by focusing on the lyrics (I don't speak a lick of spanish and it's hard to hear anything but noise) but my stupid brain makes me hear phantom noises even after they stop.I saved up and ordered these headphones and the moment I turned on the noise cancelling was the first time I'd enjoyed silence in years. We bought a house because apartments were expensive and the noise was always a problem, and now I can truly enjoy the peace and quiet of our home thanks to these. I also like that I can still hear high notes to a certain degree with noise cancelling, so it blocks out the awful bass but if I turn the tv up I can still listen to that and it's like I live out in the country. They are also very comfortable (my husband says I have small bear ears so YMMV) and durable. I've only had to charge them a few times and they charge quickly. Overall I couldn't be more happy with this purchase. They hooked right up to my laptop and phone, with minimal tweaking to compensate for windows 10 being silly. I almost wish I had more bluetooth devices because I like using these so much. They even drown out most of the noise from the AC unit when it kicks on. I'm wearing them right now because someone's got a car with a noisy stereo outside.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
Got them because I got tired of going through cheap quality wired headphones on an almost yearly bases. These work great & link up to my phone easily. I use them with my Roku through the remote app & sound comes through great. Connects with both Samsung & Apple devices with no issues so far. Works great for online meetings & sound comes through pretty clean.Playstation has always had Blutooth issues & Sony was never really into the idea of 3rd party(non Playstation products) woking with the PS4 but luckly it includes a male to male 3.5 cord & the headphones themselves have a 3.5 jack so I can have audio come through the PS4 controler with the cord just fine. Noise cancelation seems to work but causes interference with the mic when using it with noise cancelation on. Causes my voice to come through muffled but mic works fine with noise cancelation off & love the idea of the mic built into the headphones intead of a mic sticking out.,4,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0

"I'm a budget kind of guy. And I've tried many brands and different kinds of headsets over the years. One of my biggest issues with over the ear types is that after a long time of use you can feel it pinching your earlobes, or if it's got the cushy ear muffs then usually the weight of the darn thing bears down. These strike a good balance for comfort. They don't feel over the top heavy and the ear pieces are big and cushy with enough points of movement to fit many a head.Sound wise these are really good, especially considering the price. I'm not saying there aren't better sounding sets out there but for the cost these are giving you an awesome value.

Great bass, clean sound are are more than loud enough. The thing I don’t care about is the glossy black plastic finish. It feels cheap which is okay but the gloss black scratches easy and after using them a little....the buttons are all cheap plastic feel.

There is an aux cable that works just fine, but I am not able to use a BT mouse and these at the same time, I have to use the aux. Still sounds great!",4,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"Never had a over ear set before. I've mostly used buds, which I hate, but which are light and practical for doing yardwork. But I wanted to try bluetooth, and I got sick of earbuds making my ear canals ache. So I tried these, which are a low priced option, but from a solid name in COWON. I'm not disappointed after a week or so. They are very comfortable. They do get hot after a while, but not so bad. I use them to mow the lawn, and they make me sweat, but whatever. I sweat while mowing anyway.But they really block out the noise. Now this may be my inexperience with over ear, but I had to take them off for a minute because the first time I used them I thought something was wrong with my lawnmower. I thought the engine wasn't going full throttle, but it was just the noise cancelling. It worked so well. I was great to be using a power motor and not have to turn the volume up to a level that I knew was damaging my ears with earbuds. And if I do rock out, not being in my ear canal means no discomfort.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"The moment I opened the box for these headphones, I knew I was in for a treat.Cowin truly understands the importance of quality and presentation.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"As a former audio engineer, I was intreged when I opened the box and saw the card from Bill Conwin, the inventor, who claimed to be an audio engineer himself.  This may have gotten my hopes up, which is where most of my disappointment with these headphones more than likely lies.  So, for this review, my 4 start rating is instead from an objective standpoint that others would find more common ground with.  Once you get past the fancy packaging you get to the surprisingly sturdy headphones and, what I am most impressed with about these headphones by far, VERY comfortable headphones.The functions are all very straight forward and my only gripe thus far is that the volume & song skipping functions are the same button and depend on how long you hold the button.  I keep trying to change the volume level and it'll skip tracks instead, no matter how long I hold it.  This is not every time, at least, so I'll have to be patient when using these.",4,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"i had gotten these for a trip i was taking . at first i loved them the noise canceling, like in so many other reviews is on the low end. they really takes away the ambient noise but you can still here people talking. the sound quality for me was good . After about six hours of use the blue tooth had stopped working.the noise canceling continued to work  i first thought that they needed to be charges so i did that (i was no where near the thirty hours that they claimed ) but thinking i left the switch on just maybe!. after charging no help with the blue tooth . i then left the on to completely discharge and recharge still no help. and to add insult to injury i ended up carrying them all over the place like empty weight.also the pair i got looks like it might have been used. Not new like they claimed maybe repackaged",1,1,2019-3-22,1,1,0
"I grew tired of spending hundreds of dollars every year on new headphones, so, decided to give a less expensive set a try, to see if they could stack up to the more expensive, name brand units. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these headsets are nearly as good as the big boys. Sounds quality is lacking just a tad - but, I'm a bit of an audiophile, so I am extra critical when it comes to sound quality. The high-end sounds decent, while the low end struggles just a tad - but I imagine for most folks, the sound quality will be excellent.I do a lot of flying, so the noise cancellation is important to me. The headphones perform very well in noise cancellation mode, with minimal degradation of sound while in use (again, you will lose a little low-end when using noise cancellation). I also love the fact that you can use these corded, or cordless. The entertainment system on planes requires a headphone input - so, I can quickly plug it into these headsets and watch their entertainment. But, if I'm just using with my phone, the Bluetooth works wonderfully as well.",5,1,2019-1-25,1,1,0
"I haven't purchased noise cancelling headphones before, but I do normally keep a pair of over the ear headphones around the house for the computer (I use earbuds for my phone). These were a little more expensive that the ones I needed to replace, but they fit very comfortably. I'm 6', so not abnormally large, but the last pair of headphones I got did not encompass my ears. They rested a little on the lobes, which made them uncomfortable after 30 or more minutes. These headphones have larger cups, with very soft padding. I have worn them for hours at a time and not had any discomfort.The sound quality is also pretty good. I don't normally use, or look for, a lot of bass in my audio so I didn't rate that aspect. But volume, range, and clarity are fairly good.",5,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"If these had lasted longer than a couple months I would have really liked them. However, when I went to put them on my head the left earpiece snapped right off and now they will not stay on my head. At this price I don't expect the world's greatest noise cancelling or sound quality, but $60 should get me decent build quality at the very least. If you're looking at buying these, spend a couple extra bucks on a better brand.",1,1,2019-8-12,1,4,1
"We have had these for several weeks now and have really enjoyed them.  We purchased two of the headphones to take on a trip with long plane rides.  Ironically, we were seated by the wings/engine of the plane each flight.  The noise cancelling function on the headphones works amazingly well.  Granted, they are not Bose, but they are definitely worth more then their price tag.  I am not an audiophile,  but I am a musician and have very high standards for sound reproduction in headphones.  These are in the very good range of headphones.  (This coming from a normal Bose listener).  I have been happy with the sound, style, comfort, noise cancelling option, ease of connection through Bluetooth, and the extraordinary battery life.  Both sets of headphones have been great.  No issues, no problems, very happy with them.",5,1,2018-6-13,1,2,0
"I didn't care for these when I first got them because the pressure on my head was higher than I liked. However, with use, I've gotten used to the pressure and love the noise cancellation.Some active noise cancellation systems create a hiss and have a ""heavy"" feeling when it's turned on, like there's some very low bass notes being played that you can feel, but not hear. These headphones do not have that problem, so I can wear them for hours (although they get very warm).",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"Update:Initially I gave 1 star to the product but seems I got a defective unit, the company contacted me and offered to send a new unit at no cost, I have to give them credit for taking the effort and time to fix this for me.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,1,1
"The COWIN E7 headphones turned out to be much better than expected. They are very stylish and have excellent sound quality. Very often wireless bluetooth headphone devices experience sound loss, choppy reception, and rapid energy drainage when in prolonged use. These headphones, so far since using them, have defeated all those negative qualities. The noise cancellation feature is quite good. They cancel out low volume external noise, but when it comes to very high decibel noise those sounds can get through and interfere with headphone sound. However, even with high decibel external noise the ear cuffs do a great job at muffling external noise so you can enjoy what you are listening to; they also are soft and comfortable. The sound quality is great as well in that for wireless headphones the output is not tinny or high pitched but clean with a robust depth that rivals wired headphones and the types of headphones professional DJs use win spinning in noisy houses. And the bass quality is not eardrum shattering like so many headphone devices but has a wide depth that does not overpower the other sounds and instruments in a music piece. And they come with a nice carry pouch. And if you register the product you can benefit from the manufacturer's extended warranty which, if needed, is a good deal if the device becomes defective during the warranty period.The motto on the box is COWIN Headphones on. World off. This is true in that they do help muffle the outside noise while cupping the inside tunes. A really nice device.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I received my headphones and I was so anxious to get them set up. I was very disappointed after connecting to my 4k TV. The static was so bad over these headphones that I could not make out the voices. I tried all the tricks, disconnecting, reconnecting etc but nothing worked. So bummed and I was ready to give a terrible review and return the headphones.  I called the Amazon customer service and they connected me to the vendor.Super fast and so nice to talk to. After we determined that the headphones were faulty, he got a replacement set sent to me right away. I just received them and they sound GREAT.  Electronics go bad from time to time, I get it. But the customer service experience was SUPER. I will buy again from them anytime  -",5,1,2020-8-22,1,1,0
"I love these.  I went through several brands finding one that paired with my Fire tablet and my android phone and was comfortable on my head and ears.  I have a head on the smaller side and the area around my ears is very sensitive to touch.  These headphones are lightweight, the soft padding of the ears make them comfortable, and the size is easy to adjust to my head.  I have each side only one adjustment up from as small as they get so adults don't have to worry about them fitting.I would give 5 stars except for 3 reasons.",4,1,2019-5-3,1,0,0
"When I was a little kid, my bullying teenage cousin would pick me up by squeezing my head. If I screamed, he'd threaten to pop my skull like a grape and my brain would squirt out. These headphones feel like that.They're just too heavy and stiff to ever be comfortable. I've never gotten headaches from any headphones before. I stored them on a styrofoam head for three days hoping it'd relax their grip, but it didn't help at all. Headache after two hours. Bummer.",3,1,2020-6-12,1,0,1
"I've had these for a few weeks, so these are my preliminary reactions. Our house is acoustically live with a lot of background noise, so I wanted an alternative to my wired non-NC Sennheisers. I primarily listen to classical music, and also listen to recorded scripts for plays I act in. The Cowin E7's provide an impressive,  balanced sound for for the price.The noise cancellation works quite well, although some loud background noise gets through. Battery life seems pretty good, although I've not put them to a hard core test.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones on May 25th. I'm very happy with them. I don't use the noise reduction feature that often it's not needed for me. But I do enjoy the quality if the bass  sound. I listen to music with a lot of funk. A good way to test the bass is to listen to Marcus Miller slapping his bass guitar. I was very satisfied with the results!Pairing with my phone was very easy, took less than 3 minutes. I love the black sleek boxing. And the bag to store my headphones. The controls are underneath the bottom of the headphones. It came with two plugs one to charge in the other if you just want to plug directly into whatever device you're using instead of using Bluetooth. So you can use these headphones even if you don't have Bluetooth. It comes with the audio cord to do that with.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,1
"When I first received the Corwin E7 noise cancelling bluetooth headphones, I was really impressed. They pair up with my devices perfectly and the sound quality is much better than expected. The noise cancelling is a 7-8 out of 10. They don't really cancel out surrounding noise unless you are playing sound and even then, it depends on how loud your surrounding environment is and the volume of your sound. For example if i I were listening to video or music on a medium sound level, I could still hear the volume of the television if I were in the same room as someone else watching tv. Still not a deal breaker for me. I really liked them but used them somewhat infrequently as I don't often need headphones. Which is why I am so very disappointed when I went to use them today and they now seem to have a short on one side. Sound is only playing out of one speaker. When I apply pressure to the non functioning speaker and move my hand gently in a circular motion, the speaker glitches and sound begins working for only a second. They seem to have a short. Super disappointed.Update: Corwin reached out to me and replaced my noise cancelling headset with a new set. Their customer service was friendly and shipped a replacement right away. No hassle. I’m quite impressed with the way they backed their product.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"I've only used them once so I don't have a full review yet. I will update later.  The headphones are very lightweight and very comfortable. Sound quality is good.  I tested the noise cancelling function by turning on TV to 100 max volume and stood in front of it. While playing music at medium volume on headphones it nearly totally blocked out TV sound. When listening to a movie on headphones, I could hear the TV playing softly but could make out every word spoken. Being my first ever noise cancelling headphones I think this is pretty good especially at the black Friday price I paid. Plus I only tested for 30 minutes so I have no idea yet regarding battery life.",4,1,2018-11-30,1,2,0
"Update: Great headphones still average battery life is 26 hrs, when I remember to turn them off they can last 30 hrs. Initially a 5 star review -1 star for not being able to just plug them into a source and listen- they need to be charged which can be an inconvenience but honestly for the sound quality I'm fine with it. All day comfort no issues great product!One day of use so far so longevity, I will make a mental note and come back on hopefully in 6 months but honestly my memory is lacking sometimes so it may be a year.",4,1,2019-4-29,1,0,0
"These sound fantastic, great battery life, look great and feel high-end. Comfortable to wear and ANC works well on airplanes. They get a little warm on the ear, but all these types do. However, the controls are annoying and frustrating. Volume button is hard to find/feel for, I end up accidentally placing a phone call half the time and then have to hurry to get my phone out to end the call, the volume up bottom is facing down and vice versa. (??) Hard to nearly impossible to skip to next song without pushing the wrong thing. Can't turn on ANC without also turning on BT, also very easy to accidentally turn off headset if trying to go from BT to ANC because the power button, the ANC, and Bluetooth are all on the same switch. If you click it wrong, you will have to turn them back on, often get your phone back out to start your media again,take off your headphones just so you can see the right switch, etc. To sum it up, everything is great, except the pain-in-the-butt, horribly designed unintuitive controls. Been using for a month to give them a solid chance because they sound and look so good, but they gotta go. 🙁 UPDATE: If looking for decent headphones, try MPOW headphones. They're lite, they don't get as hot on your ear, good sound, they're much less bulky, and the controls are extremely easy to use! You can also use the ANC without the Bluetooth being connected, and even better, the ANC is on the opposite ear and feels different than the Bluetooth side, cutting down accidental switching enormously if not 100%, which is the case for me. The MPOW's volume up/down are very easy to use also. Using for over a month and extremely happy with them so far. The ones I have are MPOW H5s. There's newer models than the one I have, but I assume they all have common sense designed controls.",3,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"So far I am very happy with this purchase.  Both the build quality and sound quality are very good for the price.Some people complain that this product does not work well with bluetooth.  I was having a little trouble too, until I came across this bit of advice at the website of the company that makes the bluetooth dongle that I purchased (to use with a Windows 10 p.c.)  ""Please uncheck ""Hands-free telephony"" from the services setting on your Bluetooth device: Control Panel/Hardware and Sound/Devices and Printers -> select your device and right-click, open Properties, then go to Services tab and uncheck Hands-free Telephony.""

"Disclaimer: this review is over 2 pairs of the same headphone...I originally bought these in 2018. Sound has good highs and good lows. Honestly the best sound quality for thIs price range. The ear pads are very comfortable and the best overall fit I've had outside of higher end studio sets. With noise cancellation on, you do loose the bottom range and some bass, but not enough to make these a bad purchase. The durability of the materials used are the main issue.",2,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"It always annoys me when people make negative comments on certain products that are cost efficient, yet they expect them to perform at a level of ""high end"" market price.  This is a perfect example of this.  These headphones are not Bose quality which you would spend $300 for at Costco.  However, for the price point... they ""do the job"" and are very nice.  I work in an office and listen to Podcasts and for the most part, they cancel out my annoying office mates who are talking loud on the phone or are listening to the radio.  That's about what I expect them to do.  If your looking for an economical noise cancelling blue tooth headphone set... I would highly recommend them.  If you have the money to buy Bose, then do that.  I'm extremely happy with these and would buy them again.",5,1,2019-3-12,1,1,0
"I have only used these for airplane travel, connected to my iPad. They work well for the most part. In my bedroom when I tried them for the first time, there was a weird sound thing going on. I finally realized that somehow the ceiling fan and the frequency were colliding and I was hearing distortion matching the rotation of the fan. It was actually painful. If I reached up and touched the sides of the headset, the noise would stop. But, I wasn’t going to be sitting in my bedroom so I didn’t send them back (because they are really inexpensive for Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones. On to the plane I went. Started my show and there was none of that weird sound in my brain. Every now and then, if I turned my head to either side, I’d hear a little distortion, but staring directly at the screen, it was perfect. The noise cancelling is perfectly tuned for airplane noise. I could hear it slightly in the distance, but for the most part had a wonderfully full and loud listening experience. I watched “Bohemian Rhapsody” and forgot where I was and may have sung out loud in the plane once. If you want inexpensive, good noise cancelling, and good sound quality, they worked really well.",4,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"I rarely write Amazon reviews; when I do, it is because I feel confident I have something useful to say. In this case, it is because I tried several different Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones all under $80, and this was by far the best choice.I was specifically looking for three things: good sound quality (especially in the bass range) when listening to music or watching videos, good sound quality on Zoom and Skype and similar platforms, and ease of use with these video conferencing platforms. Among the headphone I also tried are COWIN SE7 (which is a newer version than E7, but actually has lesser sound quality in the bass range and less effective noise-canceling) and Mpow H19 (which lost to both E7 and SE7 in both departments).",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I am 2 weeks into attempting to make the Mic of these headphones work consistently on windows 10.  The headphones work great paired to smart phones for both music and voice calls.On windows 10, the Mic will work the very first time you install them and then after a reboot or sleep on that PC the Mic will not work again until you uninstall and reinstall the Bluetooth device.",1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"These are just so-so.  I've had them for awhile now before reviewing them.  I like 'em. I don't love 'em.  They are fairly comfortable even for extended wear (say, 8+ hours at my desk).  Battery life is great, to the point where they'll ""suddenly"" die on me and then I'll realize that I can't remember the last time I actually had to charge them.  Also the noise cancelling works alright, it cuts out all the A/C drone in the office and reduces some of the other ambient noises.That's about where the positive things run out.  wiggling/moving/tapping the headphone (especially the ear cups) will make the bluetooth cut out and act funny.  Sound quality overall is so-so, across several types of listening, from rock, rap, and podcasts I was not really impressed with the sound quality.  Bass is not present in any meaningful way, and the higher frequencies are not especially pronounced either.",3,1,2018-12-11,1,1,0
"I purchased these headphones to watch TV.  I've got significant hearing loss and even with my hearing aids, I was driving everyone crazy with the TV volume.  I purchased these headphones to use the Bluetooth connection and they have performed wonderfully.  I can listen and understand the TV while everyone else listens at a normal volume and we're all comfortable.  The noise canceling feature seems good to me, but I have nothing to compare it to.  This is the first set of noise canceling headphones I've owned.  A really nice plus is the microphone, which gives me the ability to talk on the cell phone with my headphones on.  I did not expect that and I find it very useful when working at the computer.  I am very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,2,0
"I’m no slouch with technology, but this is my first foray into the world of noise canceling headphones. When it comes to headphones my EarPods typically do the job that I’ve needed them to do. When at home and wanting to watch the tube at night without disturbing the rest of the house, I turn to my Sennheiser RS120 on-ear headphones - not top shelf, but they do the job.But the one place where all of the headphones I’ve used have failed me?

"I bought these for my son when he graduated from high school - thought noise cancelling would be helpful in a college dorm. He only likes over the ear sound, and said they were fantastic. Comfortable, good sound. About six months later, he said part of one headphone broke and he said it didn't appear fixable. I contacted the company, since it was under warranty, and asked if I could send them in for repair. They said, no, they would send a BRAND NEW pair and apologized that they broke. He was thrilled. Now almost a year later, he told me he's not sure he'll ever own a different brand of headphones - that's how much he likes them. I was blown away by their commitment to stand by their product and their excellent customer service. Bravo COWIN.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
"I bought a pair of these headphones about a month ago for my wife bc her old headphones had broke across the headband. After several months of watching her glue old pair, I decided to surprise her with a new pair. I was looking for a noise canceling pair for her to listen to audio books while I watch sporting events in bedroom. I chose the E-7 bc of the many reviews, over 2500, also about 80% positive customer ratings. The price range was excellent too, @$70.  I'm not sure why ppl spent $200-300 on a pair of headphones. However, I was a little skeptical bc I hadn't heard of this Cowin brand. But I decided to go with it. I was slightly impressed once they arrived w/ the way they were packed in it's box. After my wife charged them I decided to try them out listening to music on my phone while she was at work. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 for the quality of sound, nice deep bass but not too overwhelming on the ears!! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 for comfort & look. I guess my only problem...I've been wearing them more than my wife. My wife has advised me that she wants her own pair of Cowin E-7. I ditched my SkullCandy brand & only use them to cut grass now. So I'll be ordering another pair really soon. The noise canceling works great w normal level noises & surrounding conversations. Battery life is awesome in my opinion too. Oh also Cowin stands behind their product w a 18 month warranty.",5,1,2017-7-4,1,4,0
"I got these today and charged them up.  Synced with bluetooth to my Windows 7 desktop without any issues.I had a Tao (which broke on my 3 times in 3 year but at least they worked).  The Tao I would just sync up and hit play and got sound.  Simple.  Easy.  Worked as expected.  These?  I put them on my head and first thing I notice is TIGHT.  Sealed on my ears.  Pressure.  Ear pain and a headache.  Maybe that's the noise cancelling, but geesh.  I couldn't stand it.  So anyways I hit play on a youtube vid.  Nothing.  No sound.  The video is playing and no sound.  I have everything turned up and on.  Nothing.  I google the issue and see a lot of problems.  I got into the setting and do something in there and finally get sound.  Not sure what I did.  And the sound was horrible.  IT was fuzzy and a little distorted.  Definitely something wrong.  No idea what.  So one suggestion was to uninstall the driver and try again.  I do that.  Again, connects fine.  No sound.  Never got sound again and eventually after my head started to feel like I was going up into a mountain I had to remove them, uninstall the driver, put this piece of crap back into the box and get a refund.  Too many good wireless headphones on the market to deal with something this difficult and frustrating.  I'll pass.",1,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I bought this pair after my husband liked the black pair I got him for Christmas so much. They make them in enough colors, it's possible to get everyone in a family different colors so they can be told apart, and I was happy that the blue goes with a lot of my outfits. (It's brighter than the pictures show.) What surprised me was that these are an uncommonly comfy pair of headphones, and though I bought them mainly to cancel out the noise of my kid practicing while I was trying to work, sometimes I do also wear them to listen to an audiobook at night and more than once I've fallen asleep in them. The earcups are just that soft. The battery life is nicer than I expected, though like an mp3 player, you can hear when the charger is plugged in if you're using them, so best to charge them up first. And the headband part is very nicely adjustable, which works well for people with larger heads and longer hair. I haven't gotten my hair caught in these once, which is rare for headphones. I couldn't abide my friend's Beats for even the length of the podcast she was trying to play for me, so these are a very welcome improvement, even though they are much more affordable. All in all, a very pleasant surprise!",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"After I figured out how to connect it to my desktop, using the recommended USB Bluetooth adapter (mini-CD included), I am very happy with it. I use it for news, streaming videos, and, of course, music. After years of tripping over a headphone cord, this is blissful freedom. It's light and quite comfortable. I don't use the NC mode, it's not what I want and not using it, gives me much longer use per charge. I know there are better ones out there, but for use with my computer, this is near perfect.Update: Still happy with the very comfortable E7 headphones. What I did not expect was that the moment I departed the room, things got very shaky and audio broke up or went dead entirely, until I reentered the room where the computer is located. Also, with distance, maybe 25 feet, they became directionally unstable, i.e. if I bent down to pick something up, the audio would break up. Same when I turned my head one way or the other.  I don't know if that's typical or just this particular headset. It may even be the ZEXMTE adapter that's the bottleneck. I can't tell without buying another brand and comparing it.",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"After a few uses, I'm finding this headset to be a very good deal for the price. I'm not an audiophile, but I do appreciate clear, precise sound, and these headphones do a good job in that category. I've only tried the noise cancellation in my living room, but it does seem to do the trick. I'll be trying it on an airplane this week, which is my main reason for wanting NC. And speaking of using this on a plane: I asked my husband to check how much sound he could hear while I was playing music with them on, because there's nothing I hate more than an airplane seatmate with a headset that ""leaks"" sound all over the place. My husband had to get right up next to me to hear anything and then, it was not a lot. Battery life seems to be excellent, too.My only criticism (and I'm hoping to hear from Cowin about this--maybe I have something set wrong), is that I'd like to use the headset for making phone calls. It syncs easily with my phone (Samsung S8), but doesn't allow me to hear my own voice through the speakers. I can only hear my muffled voice coming from my mouth. If there's a way to correct this, I'd give these headphones 5 stars.",4,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0

"So I was excited about this purchase.  I had done some research and was excited to find a product that appeared to work almost as well as the gold standard of Bose at a fraction of the price.  I was not expecting perfection, I was hoping for good audio and comfort from noise cancellation on LONG overseas flights.  At first all went well.  Charged well at home and appeared to work wonders with noise cancellation and sound was good on my iPhone, my iPad and my computer, not that my computer was going on a backpack trip to Frankfurt and Paris.  On the flight to Frankfurt, all went well, the noise cancellation worked perfect and the sound from my iPhone and the plane audio was good.  Got to Frankfurt and tucked it away till I needed it again.  Traveled in a case designed specifically for Cowin headphones and all seemed well.  Traveled to Paris, no problem.  Charged it the night before we were heading home.  Light came on to indicate charge and all seemed well until I got on the plane and tried to hook up to the audio on the plane.  Noise cancellation still worked, but it did not matter the cable I used, and I tried THREE cables, the audio did not work from the plane, from my iPhone or from my iPad.  It appears that I am out of the return window for Amazon, so I am S.O.L. and not really happy, but glad that I did not spend THAT much money.  Maybe I should have gone ahead and purchased a Bose set of headphones.  I will have to save up my money for those.  Maybe good to purchase these if you travel quick after you purchase them and are able to return them after your trip when things go south.2020 January Update:  So they really do NOT like to have such negative reviews and are continually trying to get me to change or delete this review.  Since I will not change/delete the review BEFORE they return my money, we continue with this.  Numerous different people from Cowin and Amazon have contacted me to change/delete this review, but since I refuse to make a change until I am refunded my money, we are at an impasse.  I make reviews after I have a product in hand and have paid for it.  I will not change my review until after I have my money returned.  Seems fair to me, but I understand that companies don't like that idea.  We shall see if they make any changes after this update.",1,1,2019-7-27,1,1,0
"In April 2019, I purchased two sets of these headphones, one for me and one for my son. I sent mine back immediately when I saw that the headphones need to be powered on to work with the direct cable connection. Why? A direct cable connection should have the option of working without power (and without noise cancelling), like Audio-Technicas.Now my son's headphones quit. They connect easily via Bluetooth, but there is sound only from one side, it is intermittent and distorted. I see no physical damage. It is too late to send them back to Amazon. Noise cancelling never worked.",3,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"My first experience with wireless headphones. It was easy to pair it to my Android phone. Now I can watch youtube videos, listen to XM radio or watch directv using my phone and now finally hear what I'm watching in the work place during my break times and lunch.I also tried it with the plug in plug without the bluetooth. Either way I choose to listen to the news or listen to a song I can now.  There is a slight video delay with it on bluetooth. I didn't try it with the plug in play wire if the delay was present in that option. I figure in bluetooth the thing is transmitting the audio that is why there is a timing issue with the audio. It's not too terrible perhaps the audio was a second slow matching the video. I charged up the headphones and everything is working. Sound quality is fine. I don't think in a super loud environment the headphones will do a great job unless I turn up the volume and blow my ears out. For general listening it will do the job for a fairly inexpensive headphone. I'm going to throw the other junk I use away now after buying this. I'm happy with the purchase.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"Headphones are supposed to be new. Appear to have been repackaged in a way that it would have been if it were new, with the business cards and bag and everything laid out nicely, except you overlooked a few things here when trying to make it look unused. First off, the instructions paper is crumpled like it has water damage and is splayed out in a way like it has been opened and read through. The paper seems aged as well. The headphones have crumbs/debris of some kind on them... they don't appear to have physical markings, so they were likely purchased previously and then returned is the thing. Which is probably why you got away with selling them as new. But see, when someone sends something back, they could have had it for a few weeks and it could have gotten water damage or damaged internally by electrical issues or something that I can't see, so to say that it is NEW and to resell it to people when it is obviously at least a return is false advertising. I will try to use them and see if there are any issues but if there are, I bet I know why. I will change my review to a better star rating if they work well but it won't get past 4 stars simply due to knowing that they were sold to me as used/returned or potentially refurbished.",1,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"Since COVID-19 lockdown started I've been using these headphones for conference calls and music/NC to mask background noise (i.e. kids) and they work perfect for my needs. The noise cancelling is not as good as some from Sony, Sennheiser, or Bose, but you're not paying Sony, Sennheiser or Bose prices. However, the NC is good enough that I can use Roku private listening with the NC and sit in the same room as my kids while she is doing an online tap dance class and not be disturbed or distracted. In fact I was able to fall asleep while she was dancing.As for sound quality, music sounds good with a decent bass and highs that aren't too tinny sounding. When using the mic on a conference call I've been told my sound quality is good and clear without any obvious distortion.",4,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0

"I bought this on Oct 3, 2018.  Today is 2/2/2020.  I was so pleased with it just yesterday I ordered another one. I was using it a few minutes ago and the sound quit working. I can hardly hear the sound and it comes in and out.  It was working just fine and then It wasn't. We use this every day.  My wife and I both use it and we often comment on how much we like it. Sometimes I use the headset while we're watching tv because I'm getting a little hard of hearing ao my wife can keep the tv sound turned down to normal and I can turn up the headset as much as I want. Most every night one of us goes to bed before the other one and we can watch tv while not disturbing the others.Update: 2/4/2020. I'm leaving the review as it is so in case anyone has the same problem they can see what I found that was wrong and fix it quickly and easily. I give it 5 stars. The problem wasn't my headset, it was the blue tooth transmitter needed to be charged. I had the power to it plugged into the USB on my tv and so it always had power. I  unplugged it to use it on my amp and didn't plug it in. I thought I would see if it would work on the amp so I could practice playing guitar. If it worked I would get another transmitter for the amp. It worked but when I put it back on the tv the battery was low and it didn't work when I used the headset. the tv only charges it when the tv is on so I plugged it into a USB charger and charged it. Once it got charged it worked fine. This headset really sounds good when listening to music. I recommend it to anyone.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"Update: It’s been about a year and a half since I ordered two pairs of these headphones. I’m updating to say that, with the use of zip ties after one of the can holders broke, I can still use them but I don’t. I upgraded to Jabra Elites. The other pair of these headphones that we bought aren’t functional anymore.However I am also lowering my star rating because I have been receiving way too many (like twice a month) texts, calls, and emails from the company asking me to change my rating in exchange for another pair of headphones.",1,1,2018-10-12,1,1,0
"This set of headphones is pretty good for the price, I suppose. They're relatively comfortable, which is good because I use them primarily in bed at night. They adjust well, and each earpiece tilts independently, allowing you to make them sit well. While there is a fair amount of padding on the bar that sits on your head, they would definitely be more comfortable with more.The sound is pretty darn good, with decent bass as well as upper notes - after I adjusted the sound quality and effects in my phone and my tablet.",3,1,2019-3-18,1,1,0
"I've had two pairs of these. The first pair (the old version) suddenly stopped connecting to Bluetooth about a year and a half after buying them, but in spite of that, I ended up buying this update version. I. Love. Them. I use them a LOT. I'm quite sound sensitive and find nosy environments very stressful, so they make being out in public much, much better. Sound quality is comparable to the Sennheisers I use for my PC (non noise cancelling).The battery life is great, too; I use them for up to several hours per day and have to charge them maybe once a week. They're comfortable enough to wear for long stretches, which I do. Whatever material covering the padding is easy to wipe clean, which is important during summer when I sweat grossly on them.",5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0

"I own many Bose products, but when I priced their noise cancelling headphones the sticker shock set in!  I had planned on using these occasionally on long flights, and thought I could buy 6 pairs of these instead of 1 Bose pair. Heck they probably didn’t need to last a year to be worth the money.  Well I have worn these about 12 hours now and can say I’m really pleased.  They are comfortable,  And have excellent sound.  The noise canceling works pretty good also.  I’m guessing plane engine  noise is reduced by 65-70 percent.  With NC on you could very well miss any announcements from your captain!  I have to keep glancing over to see if other passengers are folding up their trays!  On a return flight from Orlando I was surrounded by over stimulated, junk food powered kids in the process of crashing after 7 days of Mickey Mouse giving them their every wish.  Oh what pleasure to switch on the NC!!!  Worked like a charm.  If your an audiophile, you will be happy.  Your favorite tunes will be reproduced with a big sound.  Bottom line, these are well worth the $60 bucks I paid.  I hoping they last a few years!!",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"Quite simply put these Bluetooth noise canceling headphones outperformed even my highest expectations. On a recent trip I realize my Sony noise canceling headphones would not work on my new iPad because there was no input jack. Complete oversight on my part so I ordered these have had them delivered for the return trip home .  I’ve never heard of the brand name,  Purchased them purely on the strength of the reviews. Assuming a Chinese company but haven’t looked that far. They paired up extremely easily, the sound quality is as good if not better than my middle of the road Sony headphones that these will replace .  In the pictures the Sony headphones are on the bottom and the new headphones are on the top. I paid more for the Sony’s which have no Bluetooth yet the build quality feels better On the  Cowin set. The headband is definitely built better and a softer material with more padding . The ear cups Are slightly larger than the Sony and my ears fit much better inside. Battery life : I cannot speak up about past five or six hours because that’s all I have use them so far but they have been perfect in that respect but I cannot speak to the fact as to how long the batteries will last beyond six hours. The noise canceling switch makes a tremendous difference and I feel the noise canceling is on par with the Sony it did a great job of eliminating  90% of the noise from the south west 737.  Bases very strong when compared to the Sony, actually outshined them considerably, mid range is fine highs are nice and crisp. The Bluetooth controls for advancing the songs and changing the volume work wonderfully. I have not taken a phone call with this set yet so I cannot tell you how the microphone capability works and I probably will not do that, these are specifically for listening to music. Tremendously happy with these ,I am ordering a second set today. I’m a pretty busy person and I don’t usually take the time to write a lot of reviews but these headphones are something special for the price.",5,1,2019-3-16,1,2,1

"These fail to live up to consumer ratings and manufactures hype. On the plus side, they are fairly comfortable, at least for the short time I wore them. Conversely, the sound quality is lacking. Insufficient volume, no punch to the bass, and muddy midrange result in a forgettable acoustic experience. I compared it side by side with a similarly priced Competitor’s pair I purchased a couple years ago (Modern Portable). Not even close (but granted, I was impressed that the old pair I have rivaled the $250+ Bose I compared them to). I did not take the opportunity to test the noise cancelling feature on these. On the trivial end, the 3.5 mm audio cable is a hard plastic cord that seems ultra cheap, but it gets the job done if you’re not using Bluetooth.",2,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0

"Bait and switch.  Both amazon's question/answer section and the manufacturer's webpage indicated that these would work when the battery was dead if you used the cord and hardwired to source.  Not true.  Manufacturer has updated info, but too late: some of us are stuck with headphones that are useless when stuck somewhere without charging options.  (Think overseas travel, camping, electricity out, hours stuck in a waiting room, the zoom meeting that won't end....).

"They are OK noise cancellation headphones for the price.. but. If you use them with out the noise cancellation turned on the audio is very poor quality and has no bass. The built in mic is USELESS! When you unmute the mic in the software to say play a game online or communicate on skype the audio quality is at it's worst, sounds like 1982 cassette tape with static or 1980's telephone quality. It's completely useless. I've tried every work around or setting and even googled a possible solution.. but nothing worked... it's got to be built in with the cheapest blutooth device. the default setting even says ''telephone quality'' and it's unchangeable. Problem is it's not just the mic that sounds like a telephone but it screws up the audio on the headset and you have to listen to the incoming audio sound like complete garbage.UPDATE: the company contacted me at one point to remove this review and offered me anything to do so. I did not!",1,1,2019-11-23,1,1,0
"I bought this headphone based upon the high rating from reviews, which I now think are not mostly actual customers. I could tell no difference between when the noise cancellation was on or off. Due to the over the ears design, there is a natural muffling of some sound, but to call this a true noise cancelling headphone is a joke. Maybe the pair I got was defective, but noise cancellation does not work. Also, I used the headphone during several phone calls and everyone I called told me that the sound was dull and muffled, so the microphone on the unit does not work well. Fortunately, I’m a Prime member and returned the unit the day after they arrived.",1,1,2020-1-12,1,3,0
Fantastic!!! I am a woodworker and while I do my projects I enjoy Audible Books on Tape and Music. I also need noise cancelling to protect my ears from the machinery. These headphones do the job better than or equal to the best that I have tried and believe me in my 31 years I have tried them all. Truthfully if there were a blind testing I would guess these would fit in the $200.00 to $300.00 range.Easy to set up and easy to use the volume and Bluetooth controls. I have listened for 14 hours so far and no need to recharge them yet. What more can I say but if you are considering a pair don't worry about choosing these and I forgot to mention that they fit snug without being tight and the cushioned ear pads fit soft while being snug to not fall off when looking around and down.,5,1,2017-5-13,1,3,0
"These over the ear headphones are awesome. This is going to sound crazy, but I had forgot to charge my headphones, so I put on some earbuds, but I could still hear my granddaughters jabbering and I was trying to listen to the Smooth Jazz station. I still had my earbuds in, so I put my Cowin's on over the earbuds. Man, these headphones are like gold to me.  My granddaughters and daughter have to yell to get my attention!  Don't get me wrong, I love my babies, adult included, but when I put these headphones on, it was as if I still had stereo sound when I charge my headphones.  Trust me, I still prefer and appreciate the wireless mode (because I'm stuck in my chair because of the cord attached to my phone) but I was desperate to try and keep my sanity.  I am so possessive of my headphones that whenever anybody or anyone walks by my charged headphones and take a second look, I give the ""Can I help you?""

"My old wireless wore out.  I got tired of the inside ear things and these were on sale.  When I first opened them, even though the packaging was nice, my first thought was..these are ugly.  A lot of glossy plastic made to look like metal.  Also the overhead strap does appear to be metal.  I put them on and my second thought was..these are heavy..who designed these anyway?  Then I  got them connected and did some Tidal hi-fi listening...wow...very nice...I compared them to my Grado's wired, and these have way more BASS.  If you like bass, well these fit the bill.

"Let me say I've owned $300 headphones before. They were a work gift that I regifted to a family member because I didn't use over the ears back then. Times have changed and I needed over the ears headphones that effectively cancel background noise. I need to study for a certification but I also live with a 33 year old who watches TV  on high volume downstairs while I'm studying upstairs. Sound, like heat, rises. I researched headphones for three days before I decided on these headphones and they are excellent. I didn't really want them for how the music I play would sound, but for how effectively they could shut out the TV noise while I play music whole studying.  I do not hear the telly downstairs. I don't hear anything other than whatever is coming through my headphones. They are very comfy and I, sadly, have a big head..If somebody snuck up behind me to do me harm while I was wearing these I would never know. They're that good . It's a great price for a quality product and the packaging is showcase quality with a very nice leather tote bag included.  I'm keeping the box they came in to store them in because it Is that well made. I highly recommend.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
Somewhat uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.  They're tighter on the head than others I have had and the over the ear feature is a little misleading.  The cushion is not large enough to fit all the way around even a small to medium ear and therefore smashes your ear against your head rather than fitting around the ear and resting on the side of your head instead of your ear...  Hurts after a while.Sound quality is okay.  Bluetooth reception distance is good.

"So I had a pair of Bose that I thought were just fabulous.  But, of course, I lost them on the train one day, and couldn't bring myself to spend another $200+.  I thought I would give these a try instead - that way, when (not if, but when) I lose them again, I won't feel so bad. Oddly enough, I do think this is a ""get what you pay for experience.""  I think these are great headphones -- for the price.  But I also think the Bose are better, and I think it's up to each person to determine how much these things are worth.  Here's my pros/cons:Sound cancelling -- no question, the E7 does the job.  But no question, the Bose were better.  I mostly wear noise cancelling headphones while I'm planes or trains.  So it's a loud environment.  The Bose cancelled better, but probably not $150 better.",4,1,2019-4-15,1,0,0
"These headphones are fine and as-advertised. They connect easily enough to your device. I had some trouble with connecting to a laptop, when they were already connected to my phone. I'm not sure if this is user error or they can't connect to two devices at once. My big issue with these is that though they have wired capabilities, you can't use them with the wire if the battery has run out. This makes zero sense since I thought the whole point of being able to connect with a wire was an alternative to the Bluetooth, should the battery get too low. Very annoying. They do hold a charge well though so as long as you stay on top of that you won't have a problem, I suppose. The over-the-ear design and the volume control work well enough to where I don't use the noise canceling feature. From other reviews, it seems that aspect works well, if that's important to you.Gave it three stars because of the wired issue. They're good headphones for the price-point, but there's probably better ones out there that cost about the same.",3,1,2019-5-24,1,1,0

"After going through several types of earbuds, and having my loving cat chew through the cords and pull of the bud, I tried wireless blue tooth. The first pair were wireless buds that sounded great. I feared losing one so I took those to my office and tried another pair of wired buds with intentions of not leaving them out for Kitty to get. Of course, after a month, I left them out and  sure enough one wire was chewed through. UUGG... I decided I would just go with an old fashioned over the head bulky headphone. I found these and they were Bluetooth wireless. This made me happy. Although they re over the head and big, they allow me to listen to what I want on my computer while hubby watches his movies on the tv. The loud parts of his moving no longer startle me as I don't hear them as much with these. The noise cancelation is ok but I can still hear things.The battery on this is well more than I expected.

"I go through a lot of headphones, I beat them up, drop them, lose them, break them. I will say I bought Cowin e7 headphones in February after receiving Beats as a gift in December and they promptly stopped working in one earpiece within the month, sent them back for a refund and purchased multiple sets of headphones, Cowin being one of them.  One set broke almost instantly, those are not available in Amazon anymore. The other set is the headband style, fun but not great sound. The Cowin e7 was impressive, so much so that I have ordered 2 more, not because I fear them breaking but because I wanted the color options for outfits.  Since i am so hard on headphones I am not willing to pay a lot so I don't expect Beats or Bose quality for $59.99 but I am quite impressed with the sound. Nice bass, noise canceling is fair, I don't think you can ever cancel all noise. I was able to sinc up easily with my Samsung phone.

"The reason I purchased these headphones was primarily for use while flying to give me a zone of quiet and to be able to watch videos on my Kindle Fire.  It's for that reason I picked these headphones primarily for the price.  Losing a pair of $60 headphones would not nearly be as painful as losing $250 headphones.  Out of the box they were easy to set up despite an owner's manual with a font definitely not designed for anyone approaching 60.  I tried out the noise cancelling while mowing my lawn and I have to say they work extremely well.  Even without the noise canceling turned on, they fit over my ears so well, noise canceling won't be needed except in extreme circumstances. I also find them very comfortable to wear.I've pared it with 3 devices so far and I have found that I need to shut off the Bluetooth on the last pared device when I want to pare it with on one of the others.  The headphones want to default to the previous device.  I noticed some reviews really lowered the rating because of paring issues so I wonder if that was their problem too.  But with the other devices off, it connects right away.",4,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0

"I've been using these headphones daily since I purchased them around 8 months ago. I mostly use them to listen to audiobooks and also to cancel out noise while I'm working from home. Occasionally they venture to the gym. I was a little nervous buying them instead of just forking over a lot more for the prestige brands. I now have zero regrets for the price.The noise cancelling on its own isn't substantial, so if you are looking to block out construction noise on the street outside your window, or even the TV in the same room, this probably isn't your best bet. But with the noise cancelling on and something else playing the effect is pretty much achieved.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"Second Update : the noise cancelling part of these headphones is awful. I can’t even turn it on without  hearing constant thumping noises. It started just on the left side and was only happening from time to time when my head was in specific positions and now it’s intermittent on the other side too, and constant on the right side. They are still fine for basic headphones and I am still satisfied with the amount of time they hold a charge. The noise cancelling is just such a huge and annoying issue.Updated review : I’ve updated my review from a 3 star to a 5 star for two reasons. 1) This company is obviously very dedicated in making sure their customers are satisfied with their products and I very much appreciate that in a company. 2) I received another pair of headphones, the more expensive, but also upgraded version, and I have zero complaints.

I gave Cowin some time before purchasing but I needed a new pair just for my commute, so decided to get them.Upon opening the packaging, everything is about expected for a new headphone set...all the attachments needed to get up and running. But, when I picked up the headphones, I was initially very disappointed with how the quality of this set felt in my hands. I'm not going to compare companies in my review, but I will say that I bought another pair, that, for the same price point, felt much heavier and was built a lot better. Moving on...",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"*UPDATE (July 12, 2020): I decided before I returned these to give other headphones a try. Unfortunately, these have the best background reduced sound during zoom calls and have the clearest sound as a headset compared to the other headphones I purchased and tested out. I tried out TT-BH085 and TT-BH055. I preferred hands down the 85 yet the only thing was nobody could hear me on the other end of the zoom calls. Everything else about the 85s was perfect! So for the sakes of call sound quality I will be giving this review an extra star.I rated this a 2 star for a few reasons. The bluetooth quality of sound apparently is amazing for the other person on the phone/computer, and does really well with reduction of background noise, almost non-existent. Noise cancelling is not accurate, noise reduction is a better description. The actual headset is fairly comfy, yet feels heavy in bulk and tends to slide off a bit. I also believe the material seems like it won't last much, saying it wouldn't be hard for damage to happen to these headphones pretty easily. The major downside (which is why I will be returning) is the E7 version comes with an audio cord, yet it only works with the headphones being charged. It kind of defeats the purpose of having the cord at all. I am very sad about this because I was really enjoying these headphones.",3,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"These headphones were really great when I first got them, but a month in and the sound clips out constantly almost as if as I'm listening to a CD in a walkman on a bumpy school bus. The mic is shotty as well, I've tried using these on zoom calls on my work computer (my original reason on getting these in the first place) and I'm told my mic makes me sound like a robot. Using the mic when connected to my phone I'm told that the person I'm talking to can barely hear me.The sound quality isn't great either if theres too much bass in a song it sounds so fuzzy and crackling.",2,1,2020-8-14,1,1,0
"Buy these headphones. For the price, they're phenomenal. The battery life is outstanding. They sound great. They're comfortable, so all day wearing is not a problem. I used to use them every day in my office and could block out most regular office noise without the noise canceling on.  I have recommended them to several people, who also really like them.I have but one complaint. I'm now working from home. I have a 4 year old. The headphones completely fail to block out her piercing voice. Even with ANC turned on. It cuts right through the stylish plastic exterior. It eviscerates the seal created by the comfortable padding around my ears. It slices the foam insulation like a sharp blade through... well, soft foam. Her every utterance manages to puncture every defense the E7s throw at them. They put up a good fight against my 7 year old, but are no match for her little sister.",1,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"Pros: it had a nice weight to it and the Active Noise cancelling worked fine.Cons:  Nothing else about them worked.  Would not connect to Bluetooth; wouldn't work even if you tried the wire.  Maybe I just got unlucky, but I'm not ordering again to find out.",1,1,2018-5-17,1,4,0
"TLDR: Returned within a day for defective pairing.I'm surprised at the positive reviews everywhere, because this was a dud for me. Main issues: I managed to connect to my device all of once, and then could not get it connected again, and the owner's manual is super bizarre.",1,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0
"UPDATE: I've added an extra star for the superb customer service received. Minutes after leaving my review, customer support reached out and offered to send a complimentary pair. Initially I thought from their email that it would be a different pair, however I received the exact same pair. Regardless, it was kind of them to quickly send a second pair as they definitely did not have to do so.-----------------------------------------------",4,1,2017-9-7,1,1,0
"I love these headphones.  I use these while cutting my grass, and at work.  Let me start by saying I work in a boiler house with a lot of machine noise, and the noise canceling seems to bring the noise level down to what my hearing protectors do.They were easy to get working with my Iphone 6SE, and connect quick when I turn them on.  They sound good to me, and are easy to operate.",5,1,2016-9-11,1,5,0
"UpdateToday, while the sound is good, there is now a ticking in the right ear, Very annoying. The sound is fantastic, these do a great job at blocking out noise even without the ANC. With the ANC a wonderful hush takes over.",1,1,2019-1-31,1,2,1
"I’ve been thru a few different brands of headphones so I believe I can speak from experience.1. Ease of operation—— Quite easy. Connects to Bluetooth device in a snap. It has only two function buttons that keeps things simple. One button is off, connect and noise canceling. The other does double duty as a pause/mute and telephone answer button. This same button is used for ending the call.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"I sent these back.  I have great hearing aids and was very disappointed that I didn't have clarity when watching my TV.  Just didn't hear the high pitched sounds so good.  Then after a week, every time I tried to use them there was static and skipped words like you get on a bad cell phone call.  Very disappointed in these.  Nothing changed, they were bluetoothed to the TV and only the TV.  Sat fairly close.  I received a refund in August when I sent these back.  Now, in November I'm hearing from customer service and they said they wouldn't give me a refund unless I changed my review.  Idiots!!  As stated, I got my refund in August and I find it reprehensible that they would require me to lie about their product review.  After all, the purpose of these reviews is to give honest feedback so others can make an informed decision.  They tried to blackmail me into making a false review in order to get my refund but it backfired as I have already gotten it.",2,1,2019-8-20,1,1,0
"Pure junk.  Thought I was saving a buck but cost more in the long run.  After just a month of seldom use, the pads started cracking and falling apart.  I overlooked this for the price point.  Then, just 5 months after ordering them they no longer charge.  The light shows they are charging, but the button seems to have broke because it never really turns on.  Just poor and shoddy quality all around.  Just do yourself a favor and upgrade to a more reputable brand that stands by its product and doesn't start falling apart the minute you use it.  The sound was decent enough for the dozen or so times I was able to use them.",1,1,2020-1-3,1,2,0
"Positive reviews sold me. Loved it and used both with RF-type (wired) input from the TV and Bluetooth from my phone and other devices. Everything worked just fine for me. I'm no audiophile, and I imagine for most adult users looking to keep your TV content down (like at night) or anything similar these headphones will work fine. Below average review hits because I've had them for less than a year and one of the ear pieces detached/broke. Now it just dangles. Again, I'm an adult user and almost always have them in the same place and use them responsibly. Disappointed by the ultimate failure in build quality.Update: Cowin offers warranty service to 18 months for non-registered devices and they were exceptional at remedying the problem. They quickly offered new headphones, emailed back and forth within 24 hours of my original email. I should have the new ones tomorrow. Couldn't be happier with Cowin, despite the failure of the original headphones.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0
"These were bought after going through top of the line Skull Candy, Panasonic, and Sony headphones. None lasted very long and all had spotty connection issues often having to re-pair to device which is frustrating. They also had horrible buttons that really made it difficult to turn on and off and charging issues. All ultimately are useless and trash. Most lasted only a couple months. These headphones have surpassed all others so far in every way.My sister who is autistic is hard on headphones and no matter the price range, they never last. I was worried about the movement and turning of ear pads and that they would break with how hard she is on them, but they have been great and no issues at all.  They are used daily for hours and hours.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0

"I saw that the reviews on these were strong but after unboxing I'm even more excited about them. I got the black and silver and they look fantastic. It's a shiny finish and it looks so good that I wish I had sprung for the red ones, but still very pleased with the way they look.They're nicely packaged and secured in the box, comes with manual, headphone jack cable, micro-usb charger cord, a VIP card to register for extended warranty at no cost, and a card to donate $1 to UNICEF if you email them a selfie with your product, which I did.",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"They charge quick can stay on for well over a day. Good sound, great bass, but small issues end up growing more annoying the longer I own them. The minimum level is a little loud; this never matters until you listen to something in bed and think ""why don't these go anywhere near as low as Airpods?"" Loud beeps can interrupt playback to indicate lower batteries, beeps when you turn them on, beeps when you turn them off. Loud robotic vocal warning when the battery hits 20% and 10% or so; it's JARRING when you're listening to something quiet, or listening at night. I wish all headphones and earbuds would remove chirps and battery warning sounds. Never interrupt what I'm listening to to tell me about the headphones, period--that's antithetical to the purpose of headphones.Built-in microphone has a terrible scratchy sound that everyone I've talked to while using it has complained about, so getting a phone call while you've got them on turns into an annoyance, and you resent phone calls because you have to disconnect the headphones during the call. This means I carry around a second set of earbuds (Airpods) for phone calls and quieter settings, and the COWIN E7s are a low-cost luxury item, which is a frustrating thing to realize about a purchase.",2,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"First of all, I'm not an audiophile so my review isn't going to be super professional.I've tried a few popular budget headphones from Amazon ranging from $15 to $40. What I found is that you either have to compromise on comfort or sound quality in that price range.  I have mpow h2 which has OK sound but gets uncomfortable very quickly so I decided to give this one a try hoping I can get both decent sound quality and comfort.",4,1,2018-12-24,1,0,0

"Bought these as a replacement for the failed (after 2.5 yrs) Sennheiser RS120. There are some good upgrades with these that other wireless headphones miss. The active noise cancelling works terrific! These are over ear, more comfortable than the on ear. They're a little small cupped, round instead of oval, but positioning over normal size ears makes it doable and can wear for hours at a time. Best thing about these headphones are the RANGE, 60+ feet, other headphones cover ~33 feet, some homes are larger and you may hear lots of dropouts. These may drop outside the range, but pick it back up quickly upon a head turn. Of course, you have to have a transmitter capable of broadcasting bluetooth range of more than the headphone range and I chose the Avantree LONG RANGE trx/rx for that purpose. Good match, great sound, better than previous wireless I owned and certainly better than stock HDTV speakers. Volume controls are a little slow, but they get there. These also boast of 20+ hours of use, don't doubt it, but haven't tested them beyond 4 hours. For the range, sound and price, don't think there's anything on the market that clearly competes with this Cowin E-7.",5,1,2017-6-2,1,2,0
"I purchased Sep. 2019.  The battery started acting up a couple of months ago - I'd use it for, say 1 hour - the next time I went to use it - dead battery.  Today I tried to pair them with my wife's phone - no luck.  Then I couldn't pair with my phone (which was my predominate bluetooth use).  Now they don't even get recognized as a bluedtooth device when searching.I can't find my registration information, so I sent them an email.  FYI - your SN is on your paperwork - don't lose it!  I can't find mine (odd for me since I'm religious about stuff like that).",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I gotta admit.  I had high hopes for this thing having read some 14,000 reviews - it’s got great reviews.  But I’m gonna have to subtract a star and the simple reason is this.  Like many others I am seeking a LOUD alternative to ear buds.  I want my ears to bleed ok ?  I want hearing damage I want SOMETHING Bluetooth that can compare to wired and sadly this just isn’t it.  That being said it’s one of the best bluetooth Over ear sets I’ve ever owned and gains its place at 4 stars with me.  Also the noise cancelation is at or on par with Bose.  Sound clarity is exceptional it’s a great sounding set of headphones.  It’s just not freaking loud enough.  None of them are.  Nothing compares to wired.  Never the less I am glad I own these now and will use them regularly",4,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0
"I liked the noise-cancelling feature and the fit of these headphones, so much so that I am now on my third pair this year. The first pair I returned due to a battery and distortion defect; the second pair suffered the same problem, but was replaced by Cowin at no charge to me, after an excellent contact exchange with Customer Service. I wanted to be sure that I had a few months of successful use of this product before reviewing it. I received the most recent headphone replacement in early August, 2018. During August, I logged 35.2 hours of use without difficulty before needing to recharge. Between 8/27 and 9/22/18, I logged 36.9 hours of battery life. From 9/24 to 10/17/18, I used the headphones 34.7 hours before recharging. From 10/17 to 11/12/18, I used the headphones for 34.5 hours before charging. From 11/12 to 12/3/18, I used the headphones for 33.6 hours before charging. And finally, between 12/3 to 12/30/18, I logged 30.7 hours of use before recharging. Although I am also tracking January, 2019, I do not plan to report that result. Overall, the fit of the headphone is good, in that it covers the ears and provides adjustment for varying head size. The noise-cancellation is very good in my experience, compared to another brand that I tried before this one. I only wonder at this point whether the battery will grow progressively weaker, as it has shown a shorter capacity to hold power since 9/24, at 34.7 hours, and 12/30/2018, at 30.7 hours. The original estimate for usage was 30 hours per charge, so I have benefitted from longer storage capacity in the first months from 8/4 to 12/3/2018. I remain impressed with the overall quality of the workmanship and the duration of the warranty, which is 18 months. This product is highly recommended based upon my experience; I have only used the Bluetooth feature a few times but it seems to work very well on my Windows 10-based computer. Thank you for taking the time to read this post, and I hope that you will give these headphones a try!",5,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"I'm pretty unhappy with these headphones after trying them for a day. I will be returning. They are seriously lacking in volume for everything I plug them into. While they do block out noise fairly well (I can still hear myself type while listening to music tho), the audio through them sounds almost muffled and even on max settings (both on the headphones and devices) the volume is not really that impressive. For the amount of money they cost I expected better on that aspect. The bass will rattle your ear but the treble is just awful.The next thing that is a total deal breaker is the fact that when using the mic it switched to some alternate audio channel which is horrible on the audio quality. Some of my applications won't even operate with it correctly, leaving me with on a mic and no headphone volume at all. I've tried to get around it as much as I can but there doesn't seem to be a way to avoid this. Not being able to get full audio quality while using the mic is a huge disappointment and a flaw I can't accept from my headphones, especially when they cost $60+.",1,1,2020-3-22,1,1,0
"These headphones are passable with certain significant drawbacks.First, the headphones are loud on the bottom end, on the lowest volume setting, these are still quite loud.  So, if the intention is to not disturb your bedmate, look elsewhere.",2,1,2020-6-17,1,1,0
"Let me just tell you a little bit about these bad boys:I bought these in March of 2018. It is almost December of 2019 and I havent charged these headphones since I bought them. THE BATTERY IS STILL CHARGED???!?!?! I just found them after moving last year and I though I lost them for good, but just found them with a lot of charge left in them. Ive been listening to the soothing sounds of Bob Ross for the last 4 hours nonstop- and these headphones dont quit. Ive used them at least 20 times before I lost them, and all on the factory charge.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,1,0

"Bought the unit back on Prime Day, along with a hard shell case.  Within the last couple weeks, the left speaker has developed a short—no sound at all out of it.  Sometimes, I can adjust the left side of the head band to get audio to play out of the left speaker, but not before being deafened by very loud static.  For several weeks, there has also been an issue with the power switch, where the unit does not turn on (with a fully charged battery).  If I turn the unit off and on again a couple times, eventually it does activate and connect to my iPhone.  I actually thought the unit was completely dead several weeks back, but it turned out to be the faulty power switch.  Disappointed in this Prime Day purchase.",1,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
"I have a fairly big head, and these fit with only a little adjustment, not maxing the adjustment. They're very, very comfortable; fitting around my ears instead of on top, and I can wear them for hours.The noise cancellation is excellent; I bought these specifically because I hate the sound of people eating, and everyone around me here at work eats like a rock crushers.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
My COWIN E7 Wireless Headphones are AWESOME!  Delivered in a beautiful package and very easy to charge and use. Absolutely no problem linking these headphones with my I-Pod...and now they automatically link when needed with an easy flip of the ON Switch (which I prefer rather than the push-down power button found on most earbuds or headphones).The sound is crystal clear with great BASS. I really don't use the Noise Cancelling mode due to the great sound and noise cancelling on the normal mode.,5,1,2020-9-18,1,1,1

"I use it for work only, we have an open space office setup and I needed something to cancel out the noises in the background. I have a desk job 8-5 so no gaming no jumping around. this thing broke in less than a year for what I used it for I think that was very quick, had to tape it and change the tape once a month (check photos)on all fairness its not all bad news, it is very comfortable once it was working, the noise canceling feature is decent it is no Sony but its not $250  either.",2,1,2019-6-12,1,1,1
"I purchased the Cowin E7 headphones on July 15, 2019. Now less than a year later, the headphones stopped working. At first, I thought it was due to a low battery charge. But the headphones would not take a full charge. On closer examination the headband was disconnected to right speaker housing. Only a thin wire kept the two pieces from fully coming apart. The headband uses a plastic plug to attach it into the speaker housing. The design enables the speaker housing to rotate within a fix limit. A metal connector should have been used, instead of a flimsy piece of plastic. The plastic connector wore out in an unreasonable length of time. I cannot recommend this product.",1,1,2020-4-26,1,2,0
"I thought these would be true noise cancelling, but I can still hear the neighbor's dogs barking.  I can hear them barking while I'm on the phone, listening to music, and especially when just wearing them without listening to anything through them. Too much base for my taste.  I was hoping these would be the answer to my ears.  They are noise reducing, but not cancelling.UPDATE:  1/4/2020:  Received an unsolicited email from Lexi Snow from COWIN customer care department on 12/27/19 offering my money back and a free replacement if I'd change or delete my review.  After reading other reviews of this same tactic, I've decided not only to decline their offer, but to lower my rating to 1 star (from 3).  They weren't noise cancelling, which was the only reason I purchased them.  They should have known that I returned the sub par headphones and already received a refund from Amazon--back in April 2019.  I was given links to 2 other models that they said they would send me free of charge. After checking the reviews of those models, I'm about 99.9% sure they won't be any better for what I need them for--canceling noise--specifically the neighbors' incessantly barking dogs. Go with Bose or Sony or voluntarily lose your hearing.  Free is always good, but if they still don't accomplish your goal, what's the point?  Sorry, Lexi but Cowin should probably refrain from this tactic. Perhaps contact the customers through Amazon and not directly.",1,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
"Unbelievable noise cancelling capabilities, even without audio on. I have ridiculously noisy neighbors. These headphones work so well I don't always have to play something and when I do, I don't have to have it blaring in my ears. Beyond comfortable, love the adjustable ear piece. I especially love I can move about while using due to wireless. Bluetooth set up took seconds and I've only had to do it once.  Long charge, too. Got in a purple which I'd just fun. I hate that I have to live with headphones on; but these are wonderful and the clarity of sound and noise cancelling make me forget in times when I have to use them. If you need noise cancelling capabilities, this is the set without spending hundreds.",5,1,2018-12-10,1,1,0
"I was really interested in trying out this product. I was in the market for noise canceling headphones, as I travel a lot for work, but I was not willing to spend top dollar for them.

"I was excited to get these. I have been using a few cheaply made earphones that didn't have noise canceling and the mic worked horribly.I haven't even had a chance to rate the mic quality on these and I would use my previous 20 dollar earphones over these any day. It started yesterday. I was listening to music while cooking and doing laundry. Let's just say that the Bluetooth distance is crap. I can barely leave my office to go to my kitchen without it starting to lose the sound. I listen to pretty much everything and I do like it loud but these at the highest setting are just high enough to cancel out most everything else. I can still hear any yelling from the kids, barking, and laughter. Today the sound started popping, and I'm hearing bad feedback. It's like listening to an old recorder. I'm super disappointed. I guess I'll just go back to the cheap pair and if the mic works well on these, I'll just use them for discord. smh",1,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I love these headphones. The noise canceling actually surprised me. To test them I tried speaking to someone with them on. They work better than some earplugs that I've used in the past.This is the first Bluetooth headphones I've owned so I experimented a bit with them. The signal will go 20' through 2 walls before it starts getting garbled up, at 30' you have no sound. I'm not sure how far it will go unobstructed though my home has too many walls in the way.",5,1,2017-5-26,1,3,0
"I bought a pair of the red headphones and it was very different from the black pair I had purchased a year or so ago. They took forever to connect to any device and there was a weird shrill beeping that was delayed when I first turned them on. They would eventually connect to my Mac but the sound was super delayed and scratchy, I mean not at all usable. I sent them back for a replacement pair which came immediately and that was a nice surprise. However the replacement pair had the exact same problem with my Mac. I spent hours on customer support with Apple thinking there must be a problem with my bluetooth, I reinstalled my OS which seemed like a lot to do for just a pair of headphones, and then they had me erase my disk and start all the way over and the headphones STILL wouldn't work. I don't understand. I like this brand a lot. I would usually highly recommend them. But now I have to send two pairs of headphones back and honestly I'm disappointed and bummed. They looked great and felt great, I just wish they had worked.",1,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I'm pleased with the sound quality, the build seems sturdy enough, and the padding on the cups is SO comfortable. I have never been able to wear headphones (as opposed to earbuds) for more than an hour or two without pretty bad discomfort due to my glasses and all cartilage jewelry I wear, but these fit perfectly over my ears even with all of that! I can easily wear them all day long and even forget they're on! On that note, the battery life is excellent. I rarely need to charge them, and I use them pretty often.Also, the noise-canceling function actually WORKS. Obviously if you've around some very loud noise and your music is quiet it won't completely drown everything out, but it does work surprisingly well. I work in one of those ""open office"" settings where everyone is constantly talking, so I use the noise-canceling (sometimes even without music playing, just for the white noise) function to tune it all out, and it works like a charm.",5,1,2017-5-6,1,3,0
"I bought these for work, which can have some distracting background noises. The product does as described. The Noise Cancelling could be a little better, but it works okay. The manual could be a little more clear on how to turn on the noise canceling.The sound could be improved, it does sound a little muffled and bass heavy when you don't use NC, once you turn on NC, it does get a little more tin-ier. After awhile though, you get used to it.",4,1,2017-5-16,1,2,0
"These earphones are looking good, deliver good sound insulation and provide good sound over a long period of time. The rechargeable battery supplies the earphone with a long playback time. I usually recharge it every few days. The active noise canceling works well and can be a great feature during long flights or loud car trips providing a much quieter atmosphere. But that are all the good qualities that can be told about it. One of the worst things about this item is the fact, that the earpieces are attached by a plastic nob. Every time you put on or off the earphone you are stressing them causing them to break after a while. After one year of use nobs on both sides broke and i had to superglue the earpieces in a permanent position. The soft leather also is susceptible to tear and wear and if you plan to use the built-in mike for phone calls you better look for other options. This microphone is very noisy and your conversation partner will percept you as if you are speaking through your nose from feet away.Overall this earphones provide good sound for a long time with a single charge. however, the mike is terrible and someday the earpieces will fall apart.",2,1,2019-7-27,1,1,0

"For the price relative to more expensive headphones, this pair is surprisingly well constructed and effective.The materials aren't flimsy and feel fairly premium, without being so heavy that there's unwelcome pressure on my head. I will say that the space where your ear tucks in runs a little small - it's fine for my ears, but others who have used the headphones say it just perfectly fits over their ears. If their ears were just a little larger, it may not have fit.",4,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"My first use of these headphones was on a flight. I was very skeptical of any kind of noise cancelling technology and these were my first pair of headphones to feature the technology. My expectations were immediately exceeded at the airport and the E7 made for a relaxing listen while in the air. The sound quality is top notch and the battery life is well suited for long trips.However, I do not find these very useful for wireless use on a PC. There is a noticeable delay in the audio, which is problematic for video editing or games that require quick reaction times. Also there seems to be two audio devices whenever it connects, and sometimes it doesn't always connect the right one. You can use an auxillary cable to combat these issues but that means forfeiting the wireless freedom.",4,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"These headphones worked great for a while. I use them at work, so they do not get any abuse. Today when I went to put them on, the right swivel hinge popped out and now they are useless.",1,1,2020-1-8,1,4,0
"UPDATED REVIEW!  Changing from 1 star to 3 stars.REASON:  Some of the issues I was having with sound quality had to do with Bluetooth connectivity.  Connecting the headphones with an audio cable greatly improved the sound quality. But it is still not great, so I am giving it only 3 stars.",3,1,2019-10-21,1,1,0
"I have used these on a daily basis for a few months now and love them! I use them mostly for listening to audible books while I am doing dishes, making meals, any menial labor that I wouldn't normally be able to hear a speaker over. I love that there is a pause feature, or volume adjustment, on the actual set. Sometimes, I leave the room where my phone is and it is nice to be able to quickly pause, if someone interrupts my escape from reality. I have never had it die on me, while in use, despite listening for hours at a time. I try to remember to charge it once a week or so. I highly recommend this to anyone! P.S. I purchased a set for my hubby (mine-white his-black) and I asked him what his thoughts were. He said that he loves it, too. He has had several different cordless head sets (this was my first) and he likes it the best of all the rest. He said he likes that the ear pieces rotate (see, I completely forgot about how cool that attribute is), for much easier storage and reduction in opportunity for breakage. He did say that he wishes that they were a little tighter, so they didn't flip off, when he moves his head quickly.....still trying to figure out what he is doing to cause this to happen. LOL At any rate, now you have 2 reviews in one!",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I just got these the day that I’m writing this review, and I already love them!! The packaging was very professional and well done, and they have their own warranty which I love~I think the sound quality is really good! There was a bit of a delay when I first turned them on, but that quickly fixed itself. I have my volume at an average, and I can’t hear my family talk while my music is playing - and this is without the noise cancelling feature mind you. I haven’t tried that out just yet.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,1

I own a corsair void pro and love the audio comparing these would be unfair since the void is 100$ which is surprising that they still are priced as much even after 2 years but they sound significantly better. Which I also purchased them during a random sale where they were half off.Pros: the headphones have noise canceling and are Bluetooth sound ok basically they work,1,1,2019-7-28,1,1,0
"Wow! Wow! Wow! My hubby spent $250 on BOSE Noise Canceling headphones and I refused to spend that kind of money just on a name. I looked and looked, researched, found COWIN headphones, read lots of GOOD reviews, and decided to go for it. I AM SOOOO HAPPY I DID!!! I love these noise canceling headphones! I use them to mute loud children in our small apt when they need to get out pent up energy. I use them to watch and listen to my favorite videos and my favorite music. We have REALLY loud upstairs neighbors and I can drown out their too loud music, bass, and stomping! I wear them without any music or anything just to lessen the noise around me so my stress levels are much lower. These, compared to my hubby's BOSE headphones work EXACTLY THE SAME! They don't LOOK the same, but I still saved $180!!! That's AMAZING! Same quality too! My hubby likes that I can turn OFF my noise canceling with a quick click of a button. BOSE makes you log in and request it to be turned off via some app or program connected to your headphones (what a PAIN!) COWIN makes it so much easier! If I recommend any awesome and affordable headphones to others then it will be these hands down.",5,1,2018-4-8,1,1,0

I am autistic and am daily bombarded by the incessant noises of daily living.  I hear EVERYTHING and have no ability to ignore or block out sounds in my environment. These headphones have revolutionized my life. The moment I put on the noise cancelling feature  I hear NOTHING.  Just silence.  And they are so comfortable to wear. I can wear them for hours. I also like the bluetooth feature. Now I can listen to podcasts or music or watch Netflix without all the distracting noises around me interfering with my enjoyment of the programs.  Really love these headphones!,5,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"Let me start out by saying I never give a company or product ""5 Stars"" or ""Highest Number"" when reviewing due to my personal philosophy that if you give them the maximum they no longer have a reason to strive to be the best.  I am breaking my own philosophy on the Cowin E7 bluetooth headphones.I'm retired but still do some work for my wife's business, and there are times when I want to listen to music or watch something other than what is on in the family room, and that's where these babies come in.  They are so comfortable you can almost forget you're wearing them.  The ""Active Noise Cancelation"" works SO WELL it drowned out the sound of the cleaning ladies cleaning our house what with their vacuums, crappy Motley Crue music and their incessant chatter!  These headphones saved lives that day!",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,1
"I bought these earphones after reading dozens of reviews on this and competitive earphones and am really glad I chose these. I needed sound blocking b/c my gym is very noisy and their music is so loud I I' couldn't hear my own tunes. To be clear, I'm reviewing COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones  I'm adding the identity of these phones, since they offer other models and sometimes irrefutable people will steal a competitor's reviews.So... #1, the noise cancelation feature works wonderfully. I can barely hear anything in my environment (including my husband cheering his team on TV. Yay!)  2. I'm most impressed with the high fidelity sound of these phones. GREAT bass and fabulous clarity in my music or audio books. #3, The price was great also and I think these earphones are every bit as good as the ones that cost 2 or 3 more (I paid around $60 btw)",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"I really love how these come in different colors. I purchased these January of last year. Now a year later I am able to give a review now that time has passed. The sound quality is great, I have another brand that particularly buy, but they can get quite pricey (skull candy). These headphones are the closest Ive come to getting the bass I love to hear so much. I love that they are wireless and have the noise cancelling feature. I use them when I travel flying to and from work and when Im writing music (im a rapper/singer). These headphones help you to hear all the instruments and get the full effect of the song which is important especially when Im writing a song.The wireless capabilitiy is awesome I use it with my phone and laptop, the battery life is very good as well. I have also had so many compliments on these headphones when others see me with them on, I think because the color just pops. I plan to buy a pair in another or try out the newer version for studio headphones. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase. Still going strong, product isnt showing any degrading or defects. Ive had them a little over a year and take great care of them. Also they are pretty comfortable to wear.",5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
I primarily purchased this product for the Active Noise Cancelling feature as I travel frequently for work.  This was to take place of my Sennheiser 380 Pro which sound amazing but are not noise cancelling at all.  In the three weeks of having the Headphones I have been on 7 flights and 2 High Speed Ferry Boat trips to test them out on.  Here are a few key review points:The Good:,4,1,2017-8-2,1,2,0
"I already own a pair of higher-end Sony noise cancelling headphones (wired only), but was looking for something bluetooth compatible to help get through a extended hospital stay. These are an excellent value for the money. Cost less than 25% of the Sony's, but are 99% as good when it comes to sound quality and noise cancellation.A couple of caveats:",5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0
"They sure look nice in the box, shiny surface and padded parts. That's where the fun ended. Would not hold pairing with 4.0 Bluetooth receiver. Might work or might not upon restart of the desktop Window 10 computer. Yes, I downloaded the latest drivers for the Bluetooth receiver. Sound was just terrible too. Tried various configurations and found the best results, but the voices in any video or movie was garbled and muffled. The head set is comfortable, but hot as Hades on the head more than 45 minutes. I switched back to my $9.00 Panasonic XBS RP-HT21 Headphones that are light as a feather and never hot. The sound is many times better, albeit they are wired and don't have the same bass reflex, but you can understand voices from any media. I returned the headphones after three days of testing, where they are highly over rated. Look nice with nothing inside to justify the cost.",2,1,2019-7-3,1,1,0
"These are the nicest headphones I’ve owned because I never could justify spending hundreds of dollars on those fancy ones. I’m a very casual music listener—usually in the car or sometimes via Bluetooth speakers at home. I bought these to listen to music on my phone and possibly take while traveling. I love my bass-heavy music and EDM, so I wanted something decent sounding. These are very decent and good for sixty bucks. I tried listening to a couple of popular film scores, pop, hip hop, dance, rock, and a headphone testing video off YouTube. These headphones sound clear, have a good stereo sound effect, and decent enough bass (better than the ones from five below and better than Apple EarPods). I played around with the EQ settings and there are noticeable differences. None of them have the extreme bass sound of the Skullcandy Crusher headphones but this one is cleaner/crisper sound for all genres.My eleven year old son and my husband were both pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and appearance of these headphones. The packaging is beautiful and feels expensive. I like the pleather storage pouch it came with and that it was packed nicely without too much wasteful wrapping etc.",4,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0
"I dislike the product because it is very painful to wear. The padding space inside the headphones is  round, instead of oval shaped, placing too much pressure on my outer ears (Auricle, pinna). I kept them thinking that I would get use to it but it never happened. Also, the play button on the head phone stopped working after a few days. Is too late now to return them.",1,1,2020-7-17,1,2,0
"I bought these as a way to try and mitigate sound for my daughter with special needs and to play familiar music in stressful environments. While the sound is good, the active noise cancellation has almost a neglible effect. I have a white noise generator for my son in his bedroom and with the NC enabled, it filters out a little bit of the higher frequencies but leaves a bulk of the medium and lower frequencies unmitigated. Compared to the more expensive brand of NC headsets we have at work, I have a hard time seeing any satisfaction from the NC feature on this headset. It should just be a comfortable BT headset and not even advertise the NC feature. I plan to keep it because I don't like the inear headphones but it failed to work for the dual purpose I desired.",3,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"I love these headphones!! I have really loud upstairs neighbors and high sensitivity to sound, and no amount of blasting music over regular headphones was able to help. I did some research and bought these, and it was an excellent choice!I won't lie and say they're completely noise cancelling; I do hear some occasional noise when I wear them, but it's largely muffled, and there are a lot of instances where someone will be talking to me and I have no idea until they wave a hand in my face. These aren't great on airplanes, but if you're someone like me who needs to get in the zone to focus, these are a great investment.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"I've had corded $10 ear buds that are better than these things. The highs and lows constantly fluctuate, there is absolutely no bass. Listening to an audio book is almost comical. Plus everything sounds like I have my head in a fish bowl. The good thing about this set is the fit, they are very comfortable, and the sound bleed is terrific, my girlfriend can here it from 20 feet away. Please don't waste your money on this headset.",1,1,2019-8-29,1,2,0

"I am really excited about these so I will try to remember to update this review down the road. Okay, so I purchased these to wear while grooming dogs. I normally just wear shooting ear protection while using the forced air dryer but now I’m hoping to be able to listen to music while I’m doing it. They are super soft and fit well. I don’t feel like they’d slip or fall off. The controls are easy. It’s the noise canceling part that I’m unsure of at the moment. It says that they cancel out a certain decibel but I’m laid up with a back surgery and will not be able to test them against the loud dryer noise until back at work. Fingers crossed though as these are very comfy. I hope they work.I also purchased a hard case for them for traveling. This is the one I bought and I love it.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
"I dont throw them around, and I don't even take them anywhere.  they just sit on my desk.  still, within a month of usage, the left ear module broke off from the headset, dangling by the speaker wire.  i reattached it with superglue.  it no longer rotated, but at least it worked, more or less.  After that, I was EXTRA careful with them, but not more than 2 months later, the OTHER ear module broke off from the headset.  oh and the first one broke off again in a different spot.i am not some freak with a huge head and i am not rough with my stuff.  these are flimsy garbage that could not remain in tact for a few short months even with the most gentle usage.  total garbage.  DO NOT BUY.",1,1,2019-7-3,1,2,0
"Had a misfire with the first set I ordered. The bluetooth would not re-pair with my computer or phone and the small manual that came with the headphones didn't help. I returned the set and, after a very attentive customer service response from Amazon and Cowin, I gave a second pair a shot. The sound is amazing, the noise cancellation excellent. If you have issues with the bluetooth, I recommend asking Cowin to swap them out.Thankful for Amazon's return process and the manufacturer's response! Honestly I find these very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.",4,1,2017-7-8,1,3,0
"Full disclosure, I couldn't wear this headset for more than 3 minutes before I got a pretty significant headache. I searched the reviews for people saying it was comfortable to wear with glasses, so I bought them to try it out, but those people must have tiny heads because this was instantly uncomfortable with my glasses on. My wife said I should keep wearing it to ""get used to"" the feeling, and that's when the headache started. If you've got glasses, don't get this.Also, and probably more importantly, there was a loud, persistent buzzing noise when I plugged these in and turned them ""on"". Even in the Bluetooth mode, this buzzing was overwhelming. I had my wife listen just to make sure it wasn't any issues on my end. We even tried it by plugging it in to something else. Sure enough, more buzzing. This issue was likely a factory defect, but the shiny quality control sticker was a friendly reminder that these headphones just aren't for me.",2,1,2020-7-20,1,1,0
"I really love these headphones in my work shop.  I have a lot of potential noise (80+ db) at times including dust collection, saws, wood cutting on the lathe where large bowls act like a large speaker when you are cutting them out, etc.  I find that this set of phones eliminates ear fatigue from the noise, cancelling out much of it, but allowing enough sound to penetrate that you can tell a saw is running, etc.  I do have to watch some of the quieter equipment though as it will nearly cancel out all of the sound.  This allows you feedback that equipment is running but eliminates the high decibel level you have without the noise reduction on the phones.  I have a computer in my shop with a blue tooth transmitter that I listen to music with.  This works very well with the phones (near line of sight) and I find I can have the volume turned down quite a bit and hear the music quite well with the equipment running.  The only problem I have experienced is that I could not turn ""up"" my headphones but realized I was standing next to a set of speakers that were playing the music also and the phones were cancelling out the music!  Easy fix... turn down the speakers - duh.  I love them!",5,1,2019-1-16,1,0,0
"I actually use these to block out the sound of snoring. With the noise canceling on alone it blocks out low frequency sounds and muffles ambient noise. For my purpose I listen to binaural beats on a higher volume setting and I don’t hear a thing! They are pretty comfy, but can get sweaty after a while.  I’ve had them for 2 months and use them daily. The ear cushions are flattening but stills comfortable. I have notice the battery doesn’t seem to last as long- I get about 10-12 hrs of use before I have to recharge.",4,1,2019-1-2,1,2,0
"I was so excited to try these out.  I ordered a black pair and got a purple pair instead. Amazon fixed it, but I had to wait 2 more days before I could try them out.  When I did try them out I had issues with the Bluetooth cutting out or slowing down and then speeding up to catch up. That was annoying, but not the worst thing in the world.  Then I took a call from my boss...I was listening to music when my boss called on my computer.  I was feeling all techno-superior when I switched over to the new call. My boss immediately told me to get a new pair of headphones.  The mic was terrible and there was an annoying hiss in the background all the time.  I thought maybe it was a bad connection, so we tried reconnecting, but it didn't fix the issue. I ended up trying my phone, different number, different services (Facetime, Voip and Zoom) and its just a crappy mic.  So don't buy it for the mic or plan to use the mic for anything.",3,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
I have owned a LOT of BT Headsets in the past. This is the first over the ear headset that I have owned. I have to say that full props to Cowin. They are excellent for the price.How comfortable are they?,5,1,2017-9-30,1,1,0
"I bought them to use when I am work because working in a cubicle can be annoying and I can be easily distracted. I also don't care to speak to people, sometimes, when they walk by and having them on is a good excuse not to. I get lots of compliments on them if they are on my head when I go get coffee or make something in the breakroom.I legit watch/listen to movies or catch up on my shows while at work or listen to podcasts and these things make the experience wonderful and I love when something makes multitasking wonderful. I have some Bluetooth earbuds that are cool but the battery life is only maybe 2.5 hours and they get uncomfortable in my ears, and people don't see them while I am working and talk while I'm trying to hear my shows. Def get these to people block AND you will low key feel like your at home, with your cool soundbar on while watching/listening to your favs. (I also like the long battery life.)",5,1,2019-5-24,1,1,0
"The Pros: I ordered two pairs of these headphones, one for me and one for my brother. I liked their flashy style with blue LED. When I put them on, they felt great and I was very happy with the sound quality coming through them as well as the battery life. Crisp highs, deep bass, and decent mids. I was not expecting much from the Noise Cancelling feature. I was impressed with the noise cancelling when I tested it as well. I could hear it quite clearly dampening ambient noise in the house. At 50 to 60 bucks each, the price was right.The Cons: However, when I made a call using them, I was told that the audio quality on the other end was poor. I tested this by switching to speaker phone and when I did so the audio quality improved. I also tested it by leaving a voicemail on a friend's facetime account. When I listened to it back, it had background noise and sounded more like a CB radio than a phone conversation. When I received a call from my brother using another pair of  e7s, the voice quality from his headset also sounded poor. I could only understand most of what he was saying and often had to ask him to repeat himself. If we had a short message to convey, the mic would have worked ok for that, but it would be unpleasant for a longer conversation. That is why I am giving this headset three stars.",3,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"Being a Mom of a very active little boy, the moments I have to myself are rare and I like to make the most of them for sure! Noise canceling is essential! Go on son, play your drums...practice that violin and your clarinet...Mommy is in the den with her music on...It's allllllll good! These are super light-weight and have unbelievably great sound quality! Battery charging is quick and long lasting. They adjust and fit like a dream. Definitely comparable in quality and performance as some of the higher priced units (trust me...I've had them all pretty much...did I mention that I'm a Mom with a VERY active son?) #MommyMomentsMaintainSanity",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"Sound is good. The headphones, though on the heavier side are comfortable for extended wear. The noise cancellation on the other hand is very spotty. It starts out as if the white light of ANC being active, but as soon as it is connected to any sound source like a laptop or tablet, the Noise cancellation light goes to blue and there is no Noise cancellation. At best it is absence of a slight buzz that is otherwise present in ""BT"" setting.So get it for decent sound, but not for NOISE CANCELLATION. Looks elsewhere for ANC !",5,1,2017-10-5,1,2,0
"Not very comfortable to me. But I have a big head. These aren't ""real"" noise cancelling headphones. I guess you have to pay 2-3 hundred for those. The only way to really cancel out any sound is to turn up the volume. The battery life is great and the distance you can use these away from your device is amazing. Sound quality isn't bad, either. Overall, nice headphones.Update August 2017",4,1,2017-3-13,1,2,0
"$70....! Me thinks these are overpriced. Mainly paying for the metal frame which is great because my last pair (discontinued Soul by Ludicris) broke. No where near the same sound quality of those. Watched a video here and YouTube that stated they were worth purchasing. When I opened the box which was encased in plastic, the ear cups had dirt on them and there were smudges. Unless the dirt fairy unleashed its wrath, these belonged to someone else. A bit bummed about no hard case just a soft bag to place the headphones in. I keep them in the box they arrived in doesn't take up much more than my previous headphones. They are okay for now hopefully they'll last me until Christmas. So I can ask Santa for the pair I truly want.Pros",3,1,2017-9-15,1,2,0
"I've been searching for some great bluetooth headphones to replace my beloved Hesh 2's from Skullcandy, which pooped out on me about a year ago after about three and half years of service. I bought and immediately returned a pair from TauTronics that didn't work right, but even if the noise cancellation HAD worked on those, I really didn't like the tinny sound and the dull mids. I tried them against my fiancee's MPOW headphones, and hers sounded much better than the TauTronics.So, rather than try for an exchange for a fully working pair of TauTronics, I was presented with a sale on the Cowin E7s. I'm glad they were on sale and that I bought them, because these have a great sound from the bass lows to the highs. I could go on about how I like the sound, how they're not QUITE as great as the Hesh 2 was, but for the cost I'm happy. The noise cancelling function is--meh. It clearly works, because when you slide the function button to NC, the overall sound of the music gets a little canny, but I couldn't tell a major difference in background sounds between the normal and the NC function. Perhaps if I tried them out in a much more noisy environment I'd reconsider my opinion, but I'm also not basing my like or dislike on this particular function.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I have a wired set of Bose NC Headphones for intercontinental flights so I bought the Cowin E7 for a “work” set that I wouldn’t mind if they got beat up a bit entertaining me while working at home - like outside work i.e., tractor, posthole digging, fence repair, irrigation, building, etc.Same as other reviews, good sound, comfortable for a few hours at a time before I have to give my ears a break, easy operating controls. The big difference is noise canceling between the Bose and Cowin. Bose is very much superior, but at 5 times the price; so to me the Cowin are worth it for how I use them. Being “wired” on a 14 hour flight is not an issue. Being free from wires while jostling tools and taking headphones on and off makes the Cowin my choice for everyday. They really are a good Bluetooth and Noise Canceling Headphones with really good sound quality for a very reasonable price.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"The E7s were easy to set up, although as others have noted the ""user manual"" is sparse. Bluetooth connected to my Acer Tablet quickly and I was in business! I'm 6'3"" and pretty good sized and the E7s fit my ears nicely. They look impressive, too! :-)))) I'm not an ""expert user,"" and will use the phones to listen to Youtube music videos, my own digitized CD collection, and perhaps audio books. Sometimes the E7s will be used in airplanes and so the nice fit around my ears is a definite plus! I marked the sound quality a ""4"", - same with the bass, as the E7s tend to be too bassy - overshowing the midrange and treble sounds to a degree. Pretty much the same with downloaded CDs, as well. Not a deal killer and the problem may result more from the way the music was recorded, than from any shortcomings of the #7s. I just sent the support team a note, and will come back later and update based on the suggestions they make. I'd still buy these again - I like 'em!",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0

"These headphones are overall solid, the Bluetooth connects easily, they are comfortable, and the noise-cancellation works reasonably well for the price.I'm a bit of an audio snob, but the actual sound is definitely too bass heavy, though I know that is the normal trend for these things. If you have the time, you can probably EQ your system to cut some of this bass out.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I bought these to step up from the inexpensive headphones I had been using and I'm glad I did.The E7 is a very comfortable headphone to wear for an extended period, say, 1-2 hours.  Sound reproduction is excellent for a headphone in this price range.  Bass is strong and treble is a bit softer, but at my age high-pitch sounds are not my strong suit.  Construction is solid and everything moves and swivels smoothly.  Noise cancellation in the E7 works very well, much better than I expected, but I can still hear slightly muted sounds from outside. though at a very low sound level that's easily ignored.  Bluetooth link-up with my Kindle Fire HD is fast and I can now listen to YouTube videos without disturbing others.  The ability to listen with them without the annoying audio cables is a real plus.",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"I was skeptical when I ordered these headphones.  It seems like headphones come in 2 varieties:  Cheap in price = cheap in construction and performance or Expensive = Good or sometime excellent in construction and performance.I'm always disappointed with ""Cheap"" but never want to pay $200 for headphones so I was looking for something in the all elusive middle section which seems to be always a mixed bag of pros and cons.",4,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"In April 2017 I bought these same headphones.  I paid $69.  Noise canceling, fair.  Sound good. Bass good.  Longevity good, since one could buy extra/spare/replacement batteries (BL-5B).  Maybe the hours are great when first purchased, but like any electronic device with a rechargeable battery (think about your cell phone), time degrades the battery and if one cannot replace the battery, the appliance is eventually useless.That is what Cowin has done, changed the battery from replaceable to not replaceable, ensuring that in a few years you have another useless piece of plastic to throw away.  Note that they still consider this to be the SAME product, when it is not.  My Amazon screen shows “Purchased 2 times.”  Not true.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,0,1
"These are almost perfect. I do say almost because of a few, minor issues.First off, the sound quality is absolutely amazing. 10/10 you can NOT get better budget headphones than this. I switched to these from a pair of Skullcandy Crushers and the difference is night and day. They are crystal clear and you can hear everything, from classical piano to heavy metal. I'd say the sound quality rivals that of Bose or Sennheiser. As I listen to my favorite songs, there are so many things that I never heard before, whether it's a subtle piano melody or entire hidden lyrics.",4,1,2018-10-25,1,1,0
"I definitely love these headphones! I was looking for something to cancel out background noise so I can concentrate better on my studies when I found this. They offered a 1 day shipping when I bought them and I was so excited when I got them the next day.  I open the package and the packaging itself was beautiful. I was not expecting that. It felt like I was getting the real deal headphones. I still haven't thrown the packaging out and it's been two weeks haha. The headphones itself is great for the price I paid them for. It won't completely block out noises like people talking loudly, but it will block out background noise. Listening to music has also been more fun since I got these headphones since I will walk around the house and it is still playing.I also have to mention that I thought my volume was off on one side and I thought that there was something wrong with the headphones. So I contacted the seller and they immediately responded within that day. They offered to replace the product, so that was really cool. The next day the volume was fine, so I actually didn't need a replacement. But the fact that matters is that the seller has amazing customer service because they responded right away and offered to replace it. So overall, these headphones are great!",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"I've had these a little over a year now and overall they're great.When I first got them, the sound quality was such a beautiful experience that I wanted to hear everything through the headphones, wireless speakers be damned!",4,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones to use on an international trip. Despite the great reviews on Amazon, I did not have high expectations due to the low price, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the headphones. While the plastic looks and feels a little cheap, the Bluetooth connection and noise cancelling work perfectly and the battery life is great. The headphones also came with a separate AUX cord, so I was able to use the headphones with the in-flight entertainment system (VERY IMPORTANT ON A 13 HOUR FLIGHT!). The padding is nice and comfortable--I've fallen asleep a few times while wearing the headphones.TLDR; I wanted a pair of cheap noise-cancelling headphones that I wouldn't mind damaging or scratching up while on vacation, but I ended up with a new go-to pair.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,2,0
"For the price, these are great-sounding headphones if you're planning to sit and listen to music on a phone or an iPad.  The audio quality wasn't award winning, but it's quite ear-pleasing and really a sweet spot for value.  The Bluetooth functionality was super easy.Why did this get 2 stars?  The mic is simply terrible, and this bills itself as ""headphones with microphone"".  I used it on a half dozen different calls, and every single person said I was hard to hear and sounded muffled.  Had this product just advertised itself as headphones, I probably would have given it 4 stars at least.",2,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I bought these for office use.  Word to the wise,  DON'T!  They are great for personal listening, very comfortable if a bit big,  and the noise cancellation is actually really good - first rate actually.But where they fail is the microphone quality,  it's so bad.  I had two customers in the same day tell me that they could not understand me,  I sounded ""tinny"" and my audio quality was crappy to them.",3,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"These are some of the best headphones I've ever had, no I'd hazard to say THE best I've ever had and believe me I've been fooled into thinking that if you spend 3-400 dollars on a pair of headphones in the past that you'll get better sound or quality, then wound up needing to get a new pair after 3-4 months due to shoddy workmanship or just bad sound quality. These offer a nice full bodied sound, not too much bass, not too much treble so you get all the beauty of the music as you listen. The noise cancelling feature is spot on, allowing me to bask in my music as I draw or sketch and relax, plus the battery life is amazing! After several days of use (heavy use I might add) I have only needed to charge them once! The conmfort as I wear them is unparralleled which is a big deal to me since I listen to music the majority of my days and other headphones would cause my ears to ach after several minutes or an hour. These headphones are just amazing, Cowin has made a fan out of me!",5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0

"I have delayed reviewing the Cowin E7 with ANC and bluetooth capabilities so that I could test it under a variety of situations and uses.I bought the headphones in the winter and first tried them out for outdoor walks in the cold.  I found the fidelity to be good and the bluetooth was fine.  Moreover, I found that the headphones kept me warmer.  That, of course, is a plus for the winter.",5,1,2017-7-24,1,1,0
"Ok, so I bought these for my Dad and he used them for watching TV when my Mom was sleeping in the same room.He absolutely loved them!  Then the bluetooth glitched the day after the return period.  I was so irritated.  I put a review on here while irritated and then contacted the manufacturer...not really expecting them to take care of me.  WELL, they replied promptly and sent out a new pair asap.  Then they called to make sure that I was doing ok.  The lady that called was very kind and apologetic I am SUPER happy that I bought from this company!  They've stood behind their product and they seem to really care about their customers.  I'm very impressed!  I wish there were a 6 star rating that I could give them for exceeding my expectations completely.",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
"Overall great, but not quite as much sound cancelling as I expected. It drowns out background noise, but if you're sitting next to people talking, it can't quite cancel out all of that. I got them because I normally work in an office that has an open floor plan, so there's a lot of noise around me. Generally they're comfortable, but I wear glasses, so when I'm wearing my glasses with them, the headphones push on the arms of my glasses and get irritating after a couple hours. Without glasses on, they're much better. Also really love the color of them, and the buttons on the side are super easy to use. I've only used them with bluetooth cause cords annoy me and get in the way while I'm working, so I really love how well they work on bluetooth. But also like that there's a cord option also in case I need to listen on a device that's not bluetooth compatible (i.e. my work computer).",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"Okay a little context: I'm a college student who works in a lab, which means a good 12 hours of my day I'm either doing neuroscience stuff or studying - both activities which are WAY better with headphones. I basically live in these, and they are AMAZING! I cannot speak highly enough. The battery lasts 2-3 days (though I try to recharge it in the night), and recharges really fast. It connects nicely and automatically to my phone (if I want to swap it to my laptop I have to do it manually but, not a big deal). The padding is comfy and doesn't bother me at all, and the noise canceling works incredibly even in the NYC subway/streets. Overall, I would recommend these to basically anyone, but I do have three tiny complaints. One, the blue indicator light doesn't really *need* to be on all the time, just feels like a waste of battery? At least being able to toggle that would be nice. Two, the shiny finish does show fingerprints, so if you really care about that then these might not be ideal for you. Three, they make a little squeaking noise not unlike a mouse when they're around my neck and I'm walking around, which as someone who works in a mouse lab, occasionally gives me anxiety attacks about someone escaping. But overall, really great product at a really great price.",5,1,2017-11-29,1,2,0
"Okay, pros: excellent sound quality. My god. These make my Bose earbuds sound like absolute rubbish. The range from low to high tones is 😙👌and bass is awesome. I can feel it in my nether regions - ehm... I mean, uh... chest. Yeah. heh.  Bluetooth pairing was a snap with my phone and laptop (though for some reason even though they paired with the laptop immediately and the buttons could control the music app, sound still actually came from the laptop, *not* the headphones - for now I'm chalking that up to user error and not malfunctioning headphones). Noise cancelling so far has been fantabulous. I had music playing on the home stereo, cranked it up to max volume, put these on & could hear my tunes from my phone exceptionally well with the headphones at slightly above half volume - and *nothing* from the stereo. Finally, these are *very* comfortable. Soft like a baby's tushie. I can take my glasses off and put them on, no problems. I don't feel crushed by the headband, and they're comfy over my glasses without crushing my frames into my skull.Con: so far I've tried a couple of calls on them and callers reported my voice sounding muffled/muddy. Only seemed to improve when I was close to my phone, which, presumably, shouldn't matter. It did make me wonder, however, if that meant the mic in the headphones wasn't working and they were actually only hearing me speak through my phone's mic?",5,1,2019-2-13,1,0,0
"This is an updated review from my original. I’ve kept my original review below this for reference, but I do have some better things to say about this company. I was contacted by the customer service manager from Cowin after they saw my 3-star review (original headline “NOT noise cancelling”. I had already sent the headphones back, but they sent me a pair of the SE7 series for free, which is one step up. The sound quality is good and the noise cancelling is decent. Much better than the originals. Although this doesn’t change my thoughts on this specific pair of headphones(E7), they definitely try very hard to show amazing customer service.Original review:",5,1,2018-12-1,1,0,0
"I'm a PC gamer and I just ordered these about a week ago to replace my old Zealot $30.00 headphones, and man, for as cheap as those were, they were much better in sound quality.

"First off, we have five kids. Our house is 1,000 total square feet and it's rarely quiet.  I bought these for my husband so he could watch videos, movies, or play games from his phone with out having to deal with the background noises of life. I didn't know they were so great until a few days ago when I was looking for him. I seriously looked in every room of the house and called his name several times... Eventually I found him when I was putting up laundry, hiding in the closet, watching a movie with the headphones on! He was baffled that he didn't hear me calling so we had to do a few tests to make sure it was the headphones and not selective listening. Sure enough, with the volume on medium, neither one of us could hear the other calling from one room away! For us this is an absolutely amazing benefit! My husband gets to come home from a busy day of work and tune out all of the chaos for a little while and then when it's my turn to get some down time by myself, I don't have to worry about hearing a random kid hollering or hooting and interrupting my Great British Bake Off.",5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0

"I love this headset. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is they are a bit bigger and heavier than I expected. But I've never used noise cancelling headphones before, so maybe they aren't out of the normal range for these. I primarily use these for watching TV, audible books and music.My situation is a little different than most people. I have had cochlear implants in both ears and my on-going rehab is to listen to audible books while I read along. I have an attachment that lets me stream into my cochlear implants, but the sound isn't right because I don't get the low sounds that come from my remaining natural hearing. But these headphones cover both my ears and the small microphones for the implant processors the sit in front of my ears and produce the best sound I could ever imagine.",4,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
"After seeing high ratings, it is disappointing to see my experience is on the opposite end for the price I paid for. I have experience with other headphones that are cheaper so I can do an informed comparison. The voice cancellation is almost non-existent in this headpohe. It can slightly lower high db noise, but it is really not worth the price you paid. The phone doesn't turn off automatically if the Bluetooth is not connected, or if it is connected but no music is played. The buttons are very inconvenient location.  I don't know if my youtube video will forward, or the volume will go up when I press the button.  The voice cancellation, power on, power off are on the same switch as a result, when I reach  them I don't know which is power position power off, which position is voice cancellation. I'm not sure if I buy Cowin products again.",2,1,2019-9-15,1,1,0
"These are a very nice pair of headphones for the price especially considering the noise cancellation technology.  They are very easy to set up and connected with all my devices easily.  I'm not a very big fan of over the ear headphones because they are so bulky, which these are, but they are very comfortable.  The padding is very soft and they are adjustable so that they fit snuggly over my head without putting undue pressure on my glasses.  I am not an audiophile so would never consider spending the money for high end Beats or Bose headsets.  Having said that, I am more than happy with the sound quality.  I find the sound rich and vibrant.I am a little annoyed at the controls.  The controls are not the same as the standard mic button controls for the iPhone.  The thing that annoys me the most about the button controls is that you can't access Siri through the buttons.",4,1,2017-7-2,1,1,0
"Quick point: these headphone are better than Beats, but definitely no comparison to Bose.My husband purchased the Cowin headphones for me for the noise cancelling component.  Tested them out today and they are a step above the Beats but not even in the same ballgame as Bose.  I could still hear my husband talking across the room in a normal voice, the dishwasher running, and the TV playing.  In my opinion, turning on the noise cancelling just removed the ""air rushing"" noise you get from over the ear headphones, and only lightly muffled any other noises.",3,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"These headphones barely work with MacOS Mojave. The primary symptom is near-constant skipping audio. Using Bluetooth Explorer (XCode Additional Tools package) I determined that the retransmission rate constantly varies between 20% and 80%. I am using a MacBook Pro 2019 w/ an i9 Intel processor. I purchased this headset with the explicit purpose of using them within an office context, and unfortunately, they utterly fail within this particular setup.I would also note that I had absolutely no audio issues using this headset with a Chromebook. They sound great, with rich bass and and an admittedly soft high range. I am not an audiophile, but I would say that they sound quite nice. My one-star review is explicitly for my inability to use them for my intended purpose.",3,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0

The range on them is quite impressive too, as I can go into the kitchen and leave them on without any dropout.The materials and finish are OK.

The plastic holding the right speaker broke so it was only being held together by the speaker cable.My wife threw away the headphones after a week, so I thought I was out of luck.

"Great sound, great feel, but the construction quality lacks.  I purchased these along with a hard shell case.  For 6 months these were amazing.  I had two coworkers buy them after trying them out.  We loved them.Things didn't begin to go south after 6 months.  All 3 pairs (including my coworker's headphones), broke due to a design flaw at the swivel point just above the ears.  The small threaded pin that holds them in place and allows them to swivel stripped, causing the headphone to fall apart.  Had they used a metal swivel pin, this likely wouldn't have happened.",3,1,2019-3-12,1,2,0
"Wow! Finally, a set of headphones that noise cancel without mandating you listen to what the manufacturer things music should sound like.  I have tried a few brands of noise canceling headphones over the past few years.  A lot of them did work, but the music was much lower when compared to other standard headsets and the sound quality was different than the original music.  I stopped buying the stupid things.  Then my youngest decided he wanted a pair to use in living area while we were watching TV so he could do other things on laptop.  I looked at the price of these and was pissed.  My kid picked out these darn junk noise canceling headset and I have to pay how much?  I wasn't willing to buy a super expensive set for him to tear up, so I gave in and bought these.  He started using them and I never heard anything from him complaining our TV was too loud, until one day it WAS too loud.  I asked him about them and he said they really work.  I tried them.  Holy crap!  The darn things really work and the music sounds like it should.  Now I consider these a good investment for what I paid.  He also takes good care of them, because of how good they work.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"Ordered these after some research and price/feature comparisons.  First though, I should mention that I have never really owned over the head headsets with pads this large that can completely cover the ears.  However I have tested various similar in the stores.  Long and short - there is nothing better than the high end Bose for noise cancelling, but at $350 simply not an option for me.  The noise cancelling on these for me don't really do it, but I never understood the need once you have the volume up!  Compared the Beats and other headsets, these are actually pretty decent.  In addition, they come with audio connectors, so if the battery dies on you and you have an audio output on your system (phone, tablet, laptop) you can plug them right in and keep on going.Service:  I had an issue while using these at the gym where I changed equalizer settings and had crackling sounds and strange control behaviors.  I mentioned to the vendor and they did not hesitate to send me another pair to replace the first purchase.  Absolutely floored me.  So while the first pair ""might"" have a problem with the bluetooth, the second did not demonstrate the same issue.  Excellent service and support!",4,1,2017-11-19,1,1,0
"I purchased the green-ish set. It came in, nicely packaged. The headset had a strong chemical smell that dissipated after 24 hours of sitting out. The material is very soft. The headset fits a little snug, but the pads are just right for the size of my ears. After getting the settings right, the sound is comparable to my JBL Mini Earbuds which I'm pleased about. Haven't had a chance to really experience the noise cancellation.I have Windows 10. There's a compatibility issue which makes the default sound quality for music and videos less than desired. Before getting the settings right, I was so close to initiating a return. It took a lot of reviews searches, some YouTube searches, and finally stumbling on the right settings to get the sound quality right. Click Windows, search for ""Sound, scroll down to ""Sound Control Panel"". In the new window that pops up, ""E7 Stereo"" needs to be connected.",4,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"These headphones produce a very good rich sound with deep bass. I listen to a range of music from R&B to metal. All sound pretty good.  They fit over the ears with minimal pressure on the ear area. The only downfall I can see so far is that the earpieces only turn one way. This might possibly could be broken off if turned the wrong way. After registering the headphones got a surprise, they extended my manufacture warranty to 24 months (nice).  I have had issues with the size of other headphones, many over the ear ones, don't fit ( too small )but these fit good with a band padding so it doesn't rub on the top of your head.",5,1,2019-6-3,1,1,0
"I bought these headphones because of the huge number of positive reviews. I knew not to expect Bose quality, and frankly was expecting just standard, acceptable cheap headphones. Ya'll, these completely blew me away.The sound quality is awesome. They barely leak sound, and the noise canceling is really impressive. The toggle to turn them on/off/noise cancel is easy to feel and reach without taking them off. I love that you can set them up via bluetooth or 3.5mm headphone jack.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I gave them 4 stars, and I will be returning them. After test driving these with BT and wired connection to the same source, I just said ""I AM A SNOB"". so take into consideration that if you are an ""Audiophile"", these will not cut it.That being said... they are well built, packaged great, sound pretty good, and BT/NC functions are exactly  as described. Are they a Bose NC BT headphones killer at $60? No. I compared them to the Sony MDR-R1 wired version, and yes, the Sony are a $300 wired headphones without NC, and that is steep. BUT the sound is still lacking in the Cowin in comparison. Disclaimer - I listen to mostly Trance, Club, and Classical (Mozart and Beethoven mostly). The mid-range is where things get bad, and only if there is a lot going on. It is as if they can't handle it. That is where it got me. It is like the ""crossover"" built into these has an issue with too much information.",4,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
"I'm not an audiophile, but I am very finicky about any device made to disperse high quality sound.  I find the difference in many sound output devices to be in the creation of a sound stage or presence that one senses envelops them in an expansive sensation, with highs, lows and a sense of being ""in the soundfield"".  These headphones are very good, but the sound stage is simply not there for me.  Technically, they deliver 20 - 20,000 Hz sensitivity and the output in volume is very good, it's just that the sound quality seems ""focused"" rather than ""expansive"", a little muddied rather than crystal clear.  Perhaps those elusive qualities just can't be had for the price point that these are in.  I don't mean to mislead someone looking for solid-performing and very solidly built high-value phones.....that's the niche that these fall into.  The only other mild gripe that I have is that they don't fit around the ears.  I always interpreted ""over ear"" to mean ""around ear"" headphones, and ""on ear"" to mean they rest on the ear itself.  Now, I'm finding that ""over ear"" seems to be interpreted by manufacturers to mean ""mostly around but also resting partially on the ear.  I think it's misleading to describe this ""hybrid"" placement as ""over-ear"" headphones.  I've got small to average sized ears, and these will not fit ""around"" my ears, but sit both on and off the ears, touching the lower lobe of the ears.  Still, they are comfortable to wear, just not as completely comfortable as ""around the ear"" sized earcup designs.  The materials overall appear very nice, super-smooth to the touch, like a fine auto finish or a grand piano.  the ear pad feels smooth and nice.  The spring-loaded pressure against the head is a little too strong for my taste, but just so.  The sound-cancelling feature works very well, the sense of ""isolation"" from the environment is definitely part of the experience as well.  Overall, there's lots to like about these nicely built and good performing phones, and I think they represent a very solid overall ""value"" proposition to the potential buyer.",4,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0
"I had Sennheiser's before which cost $350. These Cowin's are actually better and more comfortable, my ears fit properly within the cushion. And no, I don't have Prince Charles ears. But the wear comfort is much better. When you turn on the headphones wait 15 seconds before switching to noise cancelling, and these sound great.I fly 130,000 miles every year, now I don't have to worry about leaving expensive headphones or breaking them by accident. These Cowin headphones can take a beating and the battery lasts for the first flight and the connecting flight all the way from the middle of the US to Europe.",5,1,2019-3-22,1,1,0

It does a decent job taking lower frequency, low volume sound out. It's not going to be magic, but I suspect being in a plane would be OK enough at this price point. I'm pretty happy with the purchase.**Original Review**",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphone back in May 2018.  After 1 year of daily use, the right ear piece broke from its stud. I called Corwin and they sent me a free replacement. Fantastic Service! Now for performance review. For the price, it’s hard to ask for more. Granted you can buy a High end set and pay 4 time s as much without getting that much more improvement in sound. I use them on all plane flights and they cancel out nearly 90% of cabin noise. I use the hard cable to watch the flight movies along with the noise cancellation feature. Daily at work, I use the Bluetooth feature with noise cancellation to listen to music. Sound quality is good except for ultra-high treble and super low bass. This is not a recording studio headphone. The only feature that would improve this unit is a variable noise frequency cancellation. That would be fantastic in getting rid of my laboratories equipment noise. Still , strongly recommend this unit for the daily user on a budget and doesn't require studio sound quality.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
"The first pair that I recieved were defective and had constant white noise in the right ear and, if active noise cancellation was activated, would make popping noises when jostled even a little. I promptly contacted customer support and was able to get a new pair for free in my hands within about a week (I did not have to return the old ones so I gave them to my Dad). There are several good things to know about these headphones. First, they look very high quality and the weight (from the batteries) makes them feel pretty high quality as well, even though they are just plastic. The sound quality is good, nothing an audiophile would faun over, but nice and clear with plenty of bass for almost everyone. The battery life is also very good, I have never had to worry about them dying on my. I used them all day while flying, with the noise cancellation on, and they did not even give a low battery warning. Speaking of the noise cancellation, this is the average part of the headphones. On their own, the earcups dampen a lot of noise which is nice if you need to conserve battery life. If, however, you are in an environment which has a constant loud sound level (in a plane, car, coffee shop) it will lower the sound level significantly, though not remove it without music or something to go over it. It does not block out sudden noises well, like voices or car horns. When it comes to cons (the reason for the 4 star rating), there are two that are noticeable. First, in wired mode, they often have feedback issues and still turn on bluetooth even though they are already plugged into another device. Second, the active noise cancellation takes away a lot of the bass in music (movies are fine). This is not really an issue if it is loud anyway, but in a quiet environment is quite noticeable.Overall: good for the price. It is not hard to find headphones like this for 6 or 7 times as much, but these bring a lot to the table for a reasonable price point.",4,1,2018-6-21,1,1,0
"These are an excellent value for getting into active noise cancelling headphones. They aren't in the same class as the Bose QC 35, but those cost 6x more. My biggest concern was that the ANC would have a static noise, but it doesnt.  I gave them 4 stars because there is SOME room for improvement. The ear piece swivels and plastic control buttons don't scream durability, and while sound replication is pretty darn good, they don't get super loud. The noise cancelling is pretty impressive for the price point, but manage your expectations. It eliminates the drone from my pellet stove pretty well, but I can still hear when the pellets feed in.On a side note, the packaging is fantastic, it really gives more of a premium experience. They come with a carry bag, charging cable, and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable to directly plug in.",4,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"I was recommended the Sony noise cancelling headphones but wasn't in a position to drop almost $400 bucks... I opted for these and couldn't be happier! I got them for the noise cancelling but hardly use the noise cancelling feature because the regular sound setting does such a good job at cutting out outside noise and uses less battery life. So far the battery life on these things have been great. I haven't charged them yet and have been using them on and off for a couple hours a day for the last 2 weeks. The side buttons aren't the greatest and likely I won't use them much but so far so good. I did notice that the microphone quality isn't great either, but that isn't what I am using them for so it is irrelevant for me. I highly recommend for people that need good headphones for the office or gym and don't want to drop a lot of money!",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

I was using earbuds plugged into my phone to cancel out the random voices around my office, which I would have to max out to block out maybe 80% of the noise.  Meanwhile, I'm sure I was causing hearing damage.I didn't want to pay two or three hundred dollars for the expensive ones, so I went with these based on price and reviews.  I wasn't expecting them to be this nice though.",5,1,2017-9-30,1,1,0
"I haven't liked headphones since I was in middle school. I preferred listening to speakers rather than having something on my head or in my ears. When I needed them, like on a flight, I was satisfied with anything except the cheapest earbuds. However, with a big trip coming up, I decided to invest a minimal amount on these E7 headphones. What a difference! They're comfortable and, to me, they sound great (at least in Noise Cancelling mode - more about that later). For the first time in years I'll sit with headphones on and immerse myself in the music.Next, the true test. My wife is an audiophile. I can't tell you how many pairs of earbuds/headphones she's been through, with the Bose noise cancelling cans being her preference. I invited her to try the E7s. Although she still deemed the Bose cleaner and crisper in the mids and highs, it was only after side by side comparison - playing the same section of music repeatedly while swapping between the headphones. They were that close. Certainly an impressive performance for headphones 1/6 the cost of the Bose.",5,1,2019-2-24,1,0,0
I purchased two of these headphones to give to my kids.  Both were very low quality and had the same exact shortcomings and points of failures.Firstly construction seems to be of low quality. The plastic feels like you would find on a cheap children's toy.  The headband padding is missing in places.,1,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"So far I'm very happy with this purchase for under $50. The sound is very amazing and the battery life is incredible! Got this yesterday after 24 hour ship for free with Prime and couldn't be more impressed. The material feels fine, not sure if it will hold up in the gym with sweating so I'll use these specifically for traveling or just sitting in a coffee shop or office use. I'm simple, no need to use anything fancy not even the noise cancellation since sound is very superior already. The comfort of the pads are awesome as well. Couldn't go wrong with his, may have to get the rest of the family these headphones. Much cheaper than Beats or Bose and from what I understand the sound and comfort is similar.One week later Update: Nothing wrong with it, just want to say the battery life is fantastic. I got this last week and charged it once and since then the battery life still shows full capacity! I usually listen to it at work for at least 5 hours a day. Incredible that the batter still holds so well!!",5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0
"These headphones are AMAZING! The sound is great, and they're so comfy that I forget I'm even wearing them.I'm sure the noise cancelling would work better on someone with normal hearing. I had 2 other people try them on, and they couldnt hear anything, even without music or the active voice cancelling on. But I have super human hearing, so I can still make out all sorts of sounds while listening to music and with active noise cancelling on. But I doubt theres a product out there built for the amount of noise cancelling I'd need.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"These fit very comfortably on my head while performing chores around the house, even after hours of wear. I will say they are not designed to be active while wearing them, so don't purchase these if you plan to exercise while wearing them. The noise cancelling works fine and the Bluetooth works fine, the issue is the combination mode of Bluetooth + noise cancelling, especially with things like a microwave or vacuum cleaner in the background. If it weren't for this issue, I would give it 5-stars. Overall, tremendous value for the money.",4,1,2018-6-6,1,2,0
Cowin has excellent customer service! The headset I initially received had a problem where the audio was choppy. I emailed their customer service and they were awesome.The headphones are nice and very well built! The sound quality is Way better than I was expecting. The battery life on these is excellent. I actually bought these for voice dictation on the Mac. They work so well that I found myself using them to watch movies and videos on my phone too. I’ve used these for hands free calling while at home. The noise cancelling works pretty good as it cancels out enough noise to let you relax. They aren’t ear muffs but they do the trick.,5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"I loved these headphones. Don't buy them for noise canceling... they're not really very good at that (airplane noise is significantly reduced, BUT it also screws with the audio quality of your music so badly that I never found that mode worth turning on). With that out of the way, in normal mode, these headphones are wonderful. Best bass quality without being TOO heavy or drown out the mid/treble.The folding feature is cool, but, after about 2 years the wiring near one of the cups at the ""folding joint"" became exposed and that side started to not work.",4,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"Loved these things for the price out of the box. As an adult I was reluctant to spend $100 on a pair of earphones with noice canceling technology. After using in the gym and countless flights and yard work, even car trips where I wanted to tune out the kiddos while I drove, they are worth the entry price for you or to see how your kid may use them.Currently have an upgraded pair that I am even more impressed with.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"These headphones are an amazing deal. I have tried many brands ranging from Bose to Senheisser to Beats and not a single one of them offer a combination of noise cancelling and sound quality this good at this price.Noise Cancellation: They won't be able to block that annoying coworker that's driving you nuts with his obnoxiously loud voice. However, they will completely make disappear that droning a/c unit noise. I tried them on a 6 hours plane flight and while I was at the first row of the plane, they were able to cancel at least 50% of the engine noise which in turn helped reduce fatigue. So for sort of whiteish noise, they work great. For others, you are better off with earplugs.",5,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
I Decided too change my review I sent one headphone back that I was having a problem with and they were replaced it. Tec Support contacted me and wanted to know if there's anything they could do to resolve the issue. They were very helpful and supportive . Most the problem was because I was trying to connect up to different devices . Both of the headphones I have which are the  COWIN E7 Work really well Still have a little problem with connecting Bluetooth But that's because I'm constantly switching between devices. If you use the same device it will connects automatically . I do like the sound quality And The noise cancellation Works quite well even when I am  in the gym . Tease are excellent headphones for the price if you take care of them They should last you quite awhile .,5,1,2019-1-23,1,1,0
"I'll admit - I got these to block out an obnoxious co-worker that sits near me. The sound quality is OK and the noise cancellation definitely works (blocks out annoying co-worker and I can't hear the data center noise).The device has no ""idle"" detection of any sort. It will simply remain on with no sound playback until the battery dies. When the battery gets low a nice little Chinese lady says ""Please Charging"".",1,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"Out of the box these are very attractive headphones.  After charging the battery, I was quickly able to make a Bluetooth connection to my Android phone.  The sound quality was excellent.  I was able to adjust the phones to the size of my (large) head.  I then wired a connection between the phones to my home stereo, and the sound quality was good for a variety of music.My only issue so far has been the learning curve viz a viz the controls.  I have found it hard to locate the switch, the cable socket and other controls since I am looking for black on black, and the on-off, Bluetooth switch is tiny.  I am hoping that with use I will become more adept at using the controls.  I have used Bose Quiet Comfort phones in the past, which have fallen apart after many years, and feel that they had somewhat stronger noise cancellation, but at a much higher price.  I am looking forward to using the Cowins on an airplane, the ultimate test.",4,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
"I have had these headphones since September 2018 and I cannot imagine myself without these headphones! I am a college student and it is extremely important to me that I block out as much distractions from my work environment. They are comfortable, look good, and sound amazing! I highly recommend this if you are a college student just because it really does block out the background noise so you can focus on your homework. Its amazing. I am so happy I got these headphones.As for customer service. It is out of this world!! The left side of my headphones recently stopped working. Sometimes I would not be able to hear on my left ear and sometimes I would. So I contacted customer service about it and they were extremely understanding. So understanding that they sent me another pair of headphones! I was amazed because these aren’t cheap headphones! The customer service is amazing and the product is amazing.",5,1,2019-1-27,1,1,0
"I love the battery life on these headphones. I've owned bluetooth headphones before this is one of the best for the price hands down. The call quality is alright so I've been told. Going on the subway, you can't hear anyone blasting it on the loudest setting. Transit takes me about an hour a day and I listen to maybe 10 hours aside from round-trip transit so I charge it maybe once a week if that, and I'm a good to go.They're super comfortable. The metal smudges easily, but a shirt will clean it, it isn't even noticeable. The pairing of bluetooth is next to immediate and it isn't complicated process to link up and turn on. If/when they break I'll probably order these again. Honestly I don't see them breaking any time soon for a couple of years due to how well they're built.",5,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0
Very hard to beat for the price. The noise cancelling really came in handy on international plane flights although I recommend that you get used to the noise cancelling first (It puts some pressure on your ears that you have to get used to). I have been pretty impressed with it's run time although I do not think it actually gets 30 hours as advertised. The sound on these head phones is well balanced with pretty good bass. The headphones can be a little tricky to connect to bt but once I got the hang of it all is good.,5,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
I picked these up back at the start of quarantine. I looked at Bose and JBL and other brands that were twice (or thrice!) as expensive. I went with these because a) I'm cheap and b) I thought I'd only be working from home for a few weeksLOL,4,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"I work in video editing most of the time in a typically noisy tech office ( tech guys get loud when they get excited). Using any of the other headphones I have (including a few of my gaming headsets), it was hard to pick up some of the smaller sounds in the videos.Even wearing these without sound coming through, you can still hear what is going on around you, but its decently dampened. I will say with the noise cancelling, I can still faintly hear my fingers typing on the keyboard right now, but it is MUCH quieter than it would have been otherwise (I have a loud Keyboard).",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"why spend money on moe expensive headphones, these are as good are better.  I heard the sound to be crisp and clear, completely shutting out any outside noise.

Before he would sit in on these meetings but could only see the partiipants but he nowis able to actuallyhear and understand what they are saying.

I understand You get what you paid for and since paying less at lest expect little quality. But not this productI bought this product to listen to audio books / other audio on my commute to work and back. since it's not music the quality does not need to be excellent but as long as you can hear clear. Also for noise cancellation with the audio sound to block out any background noise,1,1,2020-1-18,1,2,0
"I completely love these headphones.  They are my first non-earbud headphones, and I got them because I work in a very busy active office and needed a way to drown out noise and get things done.  They are perfect, the noise cancelling on them is so good that while I am wearing them people are calling my name and I dont even hear them, even without music.  They are so good in fact that I forget I am in a room full of people sometimes and I started singing and dancing and people laugh (or dance with me haha).  The noise cancelling when the music isnt on is fantastic too, it seriously takes out all that white noise ( you know the background stuff like the headers running, the lights buzzing, etc.) you hear in a room and feels like it protects my ears and reduces headaches from that noise.  No one hears my music, I am proctor exams the past few days and put these on to watch some movies, and no one hears anything even in a superbly quiet room.  I am intrigued by the bose, but not by the price ($350 for headphones???? yikes).  I am overly joyed with this purchase.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones to replace a pair of Sony on the ear wireless headphones.  While the sony phones had a decent enough sound for the price, they were terribly uncomfortable on my ear. My right ear actually hurt after wearing the sony phones while I exercised for any hour. The reviews on he E-7 were very good and when I listened to them the first time I knew why. The sound quality of the E-7 is far superior to theSony MDRZX220BT/B. The Cowin phones were a buck more. I prefer the controls on the Cowin phones over the Sony (on the side of the phones instead of the bottom.) As far as the comfort on my ears go, these phones are much more comfortable than the Sony, although my right ear does twing a bit after an hour but nothing like the sony. Right ear has always given me a problem anyway with wearing glasses, so its probably just me. The only negative about the cowins is they are slightly heavier than the sony but not enough to drop the rating by a star. These phones are well worth the money. Paring was easy and quick (I'm using an old Nokia windows phone as my mp3 music player to be able to have the bluetooth functionality). I've only been using these for a week so can't say how long the battery charge will last, but plan on running them dry to determine how long the charge will last. Can switch to the the supplied audio cable when it runs out. Another plus, the sonys did not have an audio jack, so bluetooth was the only option for those..",5,1,2017-5-8,1,3,0
"Got these for mowing the lawn to get rid of the cord on my old Bose Quiet Comforts.  For phone calls in noisy environments they work well - participants reported very clear sound from the integrated mic.  Music quality is good as well.  But for mowing the lawn I'm using the old Bose again. These aren't nearly as good at noise cancelling, and it's hard to hear a podcast over the noise of the mower.Update:  Was contacted by the seller who suggested I try the E8 model for Bose-level noise suppression.  The E8s have replaced my corded Bose for mowing the lawn - very good noise cancellation against a very loud mower.  Warning: the E8s are huge.",4,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"The Cowin E7 headphones are an outstanding value.  Can you find, better sound quality, better noise cancelling, better comfort?  Yes, provided you are willing to pay 4 times the price.  As a pilot, have used very expensive David Clark noise cancelling headsets, but they cost over $1,000!  The noise cancelling and comfort is outstanding.  The Cowin E7's noise cancelling ability is quite acceptable.  The fit on MY head and ears is fine.  The sound quality is excellent.  I first bought a set as a gift for my wife and she loves hers.  I tried them and decided I could use a set too!  She uses hers while vacuuming and listens to music.  I find them nice to watch a few late night videos on YouTube while she is sleeping.  Our primary purpose was for in flight entertainment.  We take about 4 roundtrip flights of about 5 hours to visit family.  In the past I was using studio quality in ear monitors that cost much more but have less comfort for long periods.

"I thought the noise cancelling would be better than what it is. (I can’t even tell if it’s working or not) battery life is SUPERB!, sound is really good, however using these as a microphone/phone device is kinda like talking to yourself with earplugs on. You can’t hear yourself speaking very well when talking on the phone to someone else. It’s like your own voice is muffled. But the end users that have reported back to me said ‘it sounds like we are in the same room! Sounds great’. So microphone quality is excellent. The earpieces are a little too floppy and the size of these fit too loose on my head. Their more for a person with a giant melon. Lol. So don’t try to work out with these on - you’ll need a bungee cord wrapped around them to keep them on like if your running or something. Over all - sitting down watch a movie or listening to videos their awesome.",4,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"Great quality, both sound and the sturdiness of headphones. I tried some cheaper different branded ones, and they were swiftly returned and I can say easily that although these were twice the price, the sound quality is 100 times better.  And for the noise cancelling, it’s like magic. I’ve worn them on a plane, and I usually have painful popping in my ears throughout the whole flight (especially when using the Apple earbuds) but I had not only minimal to no popping, but I didn’t have to have my volume on full blast to cover up the roaring engines.Alternate great use for over-ear headphones, people don’t talk to you if you’re “cans” are on.

"I work in a noisy environment and I like to read while on trains and planes without distractions. I read reviews of the Cowin E-7 noise cancelling headphones and decided to try them. After fully charging the headphones per the directions, I switched on the noise cancelling function and there was hardly any difference between having the function on and just wearing the headphones with no noise cancelling enabled. Very disappointing. One of my co-workers has a pair of this type of headphone by a different manufacturer and his are great. However, they're also like 3-4 times the price of these Cowin's. Not being an audiophile, I don't listen to music off my other devices so I didn't want to spend serious money on the brand he has. I will say that the Cowin's are comfortable; they're somewhat lightweight and they do adjust well to head size. But since these didn't cancel noise very well at all, I returned them as they're not the right product for me.",3,1,2018-8-24,1,2,0
I am really disappointed with these headphones especially after seeing all the great reviews.  Maybe I just got a bad set?  My Bluetooth connection was garbage.  It would crackle even at close range and yes they were fully charged.  I even charged them a second day and had the same issue.  I want to use these for watching my two year old Sony 900 TV.  I kept having to turn them on and off and sometimes they would work eventually.  I had a pair of $25 dollar Tao Tronic headphones before this and I could walk around my whole two story condo with no issues.  They were actually more comfortable too.  These look great and I was actually happy with the noise cancellation and sound when they sporadically worked.  I was going to just ask for a replacement to see if I had a bad pair but decided I did not want to bother with it.,1,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0

"The Cowin E-7 headphones deliver excellent value.  The headphones are very comfortable to wear for hours at a time and provide good sound quality. The Bluetooth connection lets you wander around (not too far, but that's typical for wireless). You can also use as a WIRED headphone to save battery life.The Noise Cancellation works. Low frequencies disappear so car trips are a little quieter.  You'll still hear higher frequencies but even my $300 headset won't cut out all outside noise.  At this price the functionality is as good as it gets.",5,1,2017-6-5,1,2,0
"I bought these by chance last year after reading the reviews.  That was the best decision I could have made for the money I wanted to spend.  I use them on a daily basis since I retired, everyday at least 4-5 hours a day.  The noise cancelling and sound quality for me can’t be better.  I use them for running power equipment (string trimmer, chain saw, etc.) or just tinkering.  They cut out the equipment noise without having to deafen yourself with music volume high.  The bonus is the being able to take a phone call just with a push of a button.This is my second set, my last set broke (not sure why) but I can tell you Cowin knocked it out of the park, they replaced them for me.  I described where they broke and asked if I could have done something wrong, I didn’t want to purchase the same set if my use was the issue.  Cowin will always get my business, I have already bragged about their customer service.

"So I went back and forth a dozen times on whether I should spend the $300-$350 to get a Bose or Sony noise cancelling set or try one of the less expensive models.  I'm not an audiophile so I wasn't in pursuit of perfection.  I was really just looking for something I could use on an airplane (I travel A LOT) that would drown out the engine noise and the baby noise and allow me to hear the movie I was watching or the music I was listening to.  My trusty earbuds just weren't cutting it.  So I saw the Cowin headset on Amazon and all the good reviews and I decided that for $49 what did I have to lose.  Let me tell you I couldn't be happier.  The bass is deep, they bluetooth connected instantly to my phone and computer.  And the noise cancelling is staggeringly good.

The BOHMs had a weak design flaw and if handled rough could break. After babying them for years, it finally happened. Although the price point is the same, the Cowin E7 is better. I appreciate that after the first bluetooth connection, they connect to my android everytime after that, no scanning each time looking for the signal. NC feature is satisfactory and does the job well. The bass is a little heavy, but the sound is very clean. You may hear instrumentation never heard before on favorite songs. All genres sound very good. The detailed craftsmanship in these NC headphones is very impressive. Cowin takes their work seriously and you can hear it!",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0

They are great and i have found i get to my destination not exhausted by the engine noise.I also used them at my computer for on-line meetings and found them to be good but since i was putting them on then off maybe 5-10 times a day they broke at the swivel connection of the over head bar to the earpiece after approx one year of use.

"These were a replacement for my Sennheiser HD 202 over the ears that had a wire break after years of service.  My main complaint for the COWIN E7 is due to them being used in the office environment.  The 202's had great quality sound and could be played at full volume without having any bleed-thru sound heard by my coworkers.  After a couple days, I had notice the COWIN E7 could only be played at 45-65% before being heard by coworkers.  If played above 75%, nearby staff could hear the lyrics pretty clearly--despite having a tight seal around my ears.  (And there is no hair to get in the way due to having a shaved head.)  I also tried different orientations to block the bleed through sound, but it appears to be a limitation of this product.

"A construction site opened up just outside the window to my office, and the noise was driving me crazy - so I purchased these as a first experience with ""active noise cancelling"" headphones.  I've been really impressed with the quality, especially for the price. While the ANC does not drown out all the construction noise on its own (works great for low tones, like airplane noise, but not the higher-pitched whine coming from the construction equipment), I've found that pairing the ANC with a low-volume white noise app on my phone is the perfect combination to get back to peaceful working conditions.  The white noise app on its own wasn't enough to tune out the construction, but ANC + white noise is a perfect combination. The ANC, on its own, completely blocks out our noisy ventilation / air handling system, which will be useful long after the construction outside has finished.

These have done an excellent job of reducing/eliminating noise, giving me some much needed peace and quiet. Here are my thoughts on each feature:Noise cancellation: with music playing, most noises are completely eliminated. Without music (but with noise cancelling still on), I would say these reduce external noises by about 70-80%. I do like how the noise cancelling targets lower frequencies, as this is quite effective on the loud footsteps coming from my neighbors.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,1,0

The sound quality of the music is pretty good, but I'm no audiophile so others might be more picky. They work great for the price and I'm happy I bought these instead of the over priced Bose or Sony for the use I get out of them. The build quality is good for the price, they are definitely do not look or feel as luxurious as Bose or Sony. They are sturdy and I've been able to wear them for hours without them hurting my head and I have a pretty big head. I always use them with Bluetooth and they connect easily w/o problems to my phone and computer. The batter lasts forever and I've never had them die while I was using them even if I use them all day.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,1,0

"I bought these and immediately traveled overseas on business.  Even after wearing them for 8+ hours straight on the flight, no discomfort.  They do an amazing job canceling the background engine noise on the plane and the sound is superb.  These headphones also have an AUX input jack (and comes with the cable) so that you can plug in directly into the plane's audio jack. Just as important, the batteries on these headphones easily go for over 24 hrs.  I once left them on and unattended for several days when traveling, and they still enough juice for 2+ hours of music before I recharged.  I would definitely buy again!",5,1,2020-6-5,1,1,0
"- Appearance: they are pretty headphone, they have good presentation, there are some sectore of the headphone that are stained with the fingers, but nothing to worry about ... 4 stars.- Sound quality: Bad, did not sound good as I expected for that price. I had to look for an equalizer app on my device that would improve the sound, that helped me, but otherwise it natively does not have good sound ... 1 star.",4,1,2017-8-1,1,1,0
"This headphone has great sound quality, base, and noise cancellation capability. It also looks like an expensive pair of headphones. I almost returned it though because it's just too bulky for my head and it extrudes out too much. The weight and the fact that it's not as comfortable as I'd like were factors too.So I got an MPow, intending for it to replace the Cowin. After listening to both in comparison to one another, I decided to keep the Cowin because of the richer and clearer sound. Mpow headphones sounded rather muffled.",4,1,2019-10-29,1,1,0
"I don’t write reviews, but I made an exception for this.  The AUX port does not work!  Weird - that should be the one option that does work.  Quality issues happen.This part is beyond irritating: I couldn’t get support through many phone calls during PST hours and an e-mail to Cowin (over 24 hours without a reply) - major disappointments and I don’t get that at all.  Returning these and looking for another option.  Bluetooth works, but I bought these so I could use the Aux in case the battery dies in-flight.  I wanted to start using them with upcoming flights.",1,1,2019-3-1,1,3,0

Killer set of bluetooth headphones, also I have a big head and they fit pretty good on me.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
Update :After being disapppointed with the perfomance of the first set contacted the seller and was impressed with great customer service.

"I bought these headphones in the middle of January. They fit great, they sounded good, construction seemed a bit flimsy, but overall I was happy with them. They held a good charge. I could go to the gym multiple times through out the week with out having to charge them in between.Fast forward to the end of May (4 months later), now they wont turn on. Thought the battery was dead, no biggie. I threw them on the charger and went about my day. Went to the gym a few days later, and same thing.... they would not turn on. When I went home I plugged them in and they would turn on, but as soon as I would unplug them they would turn off.",5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
The Cowin E7 headphones are a good value for the price. I wanted a comfortable over the ear set of headphones with noise cancelling so that I could listen to audiobooks when I am mowing the lawn or vacuuming the carpet. This one fills the bill nicely. The ear cups and noise cancelling allow me to listen comfortably without bowing out my hearing. The connection to my phone was a little finicky with the 3 conductor (stereo) cable that was supplied with the headphones. I bought a better quality 4 conductor (stereo + mic) cable and it works much better. Most of the time I use the Bluetooth connection anyway to avoid pulling the headphones off when I catch the cord. I saw in another review that the noise cancelling is not supposed to work with Bluetooth but mine seems to work just fine.,4,1,2017-7-1,1,2,0
"For the price, I love these headphones. I have them paired with all types of things and get great sound, or I can choose to block noise, and they don't make you feel pressure in your ears like most cheap ones do, but I don't like noise cancel when listening to music, it takes away from it, so I let them be open with music and use the noise cancelling feature when trying to find peace or using as a comm device. At first the controls seemed strange, but after just a few uses, all the buttons seem to be well placed. No way I'm spending over 300 dollars for a set that can just barely edge out these!. I love em so far I've had no problems whatsoever and they sound great and are comfortable to wear. They don't have that high dollar ear muff material, so if left one for a length of time, they can make you ears hot, but other that that I feel as though I have a set of Bose or Sony's on for MUCH less money. A great starter set too, to see if maybe you do want to spend more, I bet you will still keep and use these!!!!! hehe",5,1,2017-9-12,1,1,0

"I purchased these Cowin E7 ANC Bluetooth headphones in mid June and have been using them regularly since then.  I own a fairly large number of headphones, both over ear and in ear.  I'm kind of a sound geek and I enjoy many genres of music as well as talk radio and podcasts.  Let me summarize why I consider these E7's to be my best headphone purchase in a very long time.Right out of the box, these phones look amazing!  I ordered them in black; they are sleek and shiny and the overall look is awesome.  I put them on my head, and wow.............I was struck right away by how comfortable they are.  These are without question my most comfortable over ear headphones, and I have around six pairs of over ear phones.  I've fallen asleep with them on in bed, and several hours later when I wake up, they are comfortable and my ears are not sore or hot.  Some headphones have that effect of soreness after several hours; I've not experienced that with the Cowin E7's.",5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
"These are very good headphones; not as good as my (very) expensive wired Sennheiser, but very good. I'm happy with sound quality and fit.The best thing about them is the company. Cowin provided the best customer service I've ever had. The first set I bought broke but I liked them enough to buy another pair. I was going to throw away the broken set but thought I'd try customer service. I sent a polite email, a copy of the receipt, and a couple of pictures.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"Well, you get what you pay for. These were much less expensive than competitors' models, but it did not take long to figure out why. The sound was decent, but the noise-canceling was barely adequate. It made a little difference, but not much, and there was continuous white noise in the background.Still, they suited my needs well enough for about a year. Then, they began falling apart. First, the padded leather band detached from the metal hinge on one side. Not great, but I figured I could live with it. Today, however, the hinge on the other side broke.",4,1,2019-2-16,1,1,1
"These are my first pair of over-the-ear style headphones. I wear hearing aids and I just got tired of needing to remove them before using earbuds, and then having to put them back in when I was done. A minor inconvenience, but it gets annoying after a while. I was hoping that these would fit over the ear with room to spare, and they accomplish this nicely.The sound quality is excellent for the price, as for the noise cancelling, I honestly can't tell much of a difference, with it switched on or off...there enough padding that it already blocks off a decent amount of ambient sound, so I mainly leave it turned off.",5,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0
"I bought these as my first noise cancelling headphones after my last flight, as earbuds are clearly ineffective for quiet movies while sitting near the wing. I haven't yet had the opportunity to use it on a plane, but it works great to drown out the HVAC, loud coworkers on speakerphone and the lawnmower with noise cancelling on. They're excellent for gaming parties, with the noise cancelling off, and I have the freedom of movement without a cable tethering me to the tower.The earmuffs do get warm when wearing them for an extended period or being active, like mowing the lawn or playing in VR. The noise cancelling does drop the bass down a little to compensate for surrounding noise. I almost returned them because the audio seems to cut out when I move abruptly, but it only happens with noise cancelling enabled, and my ear lobe seems to hit the driver. I think my big ears may interfere with the cancelling technology when I'm active.",4,1,2017-9-10,1,1,0
"Loved until they stopped working - out of the blue one morning my daughter found the blue tooth was no longer working.  It had worked the night before.  She had charged them overnight and suddenly they wouldn't work.  Since she is on the spectrum, she was beside herself with anxiety about this.  They are just past the Amazon return date, so I am not sure what our remedies are.",1,1,2020-7-5,1,2,0
"Bought this for my work laptop. Need to be on calls/meetings via Webex, Zoom, etc. sound quality was great. Noise cancelling from the user perspective was good. Not 100% but for the price it was good. However, on calls I was told people heard tons of static or white noise sounds! Returned the item for this reason. I was hopeful seeing all the good reviews but alas this seems to be an issue for folks here and there when I searched the reviews. I was one of the unlucky that got a bad product.UPDATE: Cowin product team reached out immediately and are providing a replacement headset even though I returned my purchase. They were extremely willing to make this purchase right which says a ton about the companies commitment to customer service. I have upgraded them to 4 stars for that reason. Hoping my replacement works flawlessly and I can update to 5 stars soon.",4,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"As nice as the picture is, it doesn't do justice to how beautiful these headphones are. My wife first stated she thought they were to pretty to use..lol.  they are fantastic headphones with great sound, incredible noise cancelling, very comfortable and easy to use. I ordered the E9 for myself after my old Bose wore out and was so impressed that I ordered these for my wife. She had been using a cheap set of headphones and ear buds which were horrible, so my wife is very excited using these and she likes the fact she can walk around the kitchen with them on and still listen to her music . She hadn't used them for her phone yet but excited to try them soon. Cowin really makes wonderful headphones and the quality is exceptional,  showing great pride in their product.  Highly recommended.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"These are really nice for the price. I live by a noisy busy road so, I got these to help when I just want to de-stress and shut out the hum of every day life. They work really well in that aspect.  I am able to enjoy my music or my show without getting interrupted by trucks going up and down the road. They are super comfortable and I can wear them for a long time. They aren't super tight and don't press into my head like some headphones can. Although, I have a small head so I look like an air traffic controller with these on. The sound quality is good. I do find that I just use the regular setting most because you lose some of the sound with the actual noise cancelling mode. The only thing I would say is that I bought the dark green ones and the color is actually more of a teal. That's no big thing really though.  Overall I am super happy with these especially for the price. These are the first noise cancelling headphones I have purchased and I would definitely buy them again.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,1
"I wore these on a 14+ hour flight to Beijing, then a 6 hour train to Shenyang and never felt uncomfortable and the battery lasted the ENTIRE time.  That alone is amazing.The sound is very good and the ability to use a 3.5mm cable (to listen to in-flight movies) is VERY convenient.",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"I love these. The feel great on the ears and their lightweight (perhaps some of the lightest). Really enjoy them. My glasses sometimes get squeeze down on my ear a little but a quick adjustment and their good to go. 95% of the time I have no issues in that regard. There is a slight(est) delay when watching Netflix but it becomes unnoticeable. I've been playing popular FPS games with them no problem. Again, a casual gamer so I'm not super picky. I haven't gotten the mic to work though but I don't talk all that much anyway. That's on me though because I haven't tried. The pads are so air tight (noise-cancel) that bass is really strong and it actually hurts my ears when cranked up which is mostly a good thing. They work great with my android device and my PC. Swapping between the two is pretty easy as well. They hold a charge like crazy. I game with them all night and forget to charge them and then use them all day without ever draining the battery. They are amazing in that regard. For reference, I also have a wired HyperX headset which has been great and a wireless SteelSeries headset which I'm undecided about.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"Low stars are for the battery function. The charged battery lasts for about 20 hours with a 4 hour charge time. It's not too bad, unless you forget to plug them in the night before you go to the gym and the 4 hour wait to charge throws you off. Not sure that's a feature that can neccecarsily be picked over or fixed, but it's a consideration for convenience. Sometimes has difficulty connecting via Bluetooth even though my phone recognises them. Other than that, they are comfortable, amazing at noise cancelation, and the buttons are easy to reach. There is no volume control directly on the headphones (unless I am just missing how to set it up) so it seems volume control is based on the device it's paired to. Great overal look, not too flashy or tacky.  A little loose when I am doing floor excersizes, they will slip off easily. As I use them more, my rating will possibly go up but I am satisfied overall, don't feel a need to return them.",3,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"We have regular Navy jets flying touch and go's at a nearby Navy owned airfield.  Unfortunately that means that they fly DIRECTLY over different routes at different times of day.  IF your neighborhood is the route for their flying time, you CAN''T HEAR A THING!!  I decided to try these headphones to see how ""noise cancelling"" they were.  Well, the day I got them the jets fly over our house (surprise, right?).  They were relatively easy to pair up with my computer Blue Tooth but our tv's aren't blue tooth compatible so I'll be buying a cord to run from TV to headphones.  I bought the green (love the color) and the fit is comfortable.  I watched a show via YouTube on my computer and the headphones pretty much blanked out the jet noise so I could have the  volume at a moderate comfort level for me.  I'm glad I bought them and they do provide me with some noise cancelling so I'd buy them again.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"While there probably are better sounding and better noise cancelling headphones out there, they will probably cost more. For the price you pay, these headphones are good. The sound quality is good with good amount of bass. They are also quite comfortable and have long battery life. The noise cancellation can drown out sounds that are continuous such as PC fans, AC, or a plane well, but doesn't really help at all with keyboard noise or people talking. I can still hear my PC fans, but it is quite a bit less quiet. You also barely hear it once you actually play something. When I first got these headphones, the right cup made high pitched noise in right cup if listening through aux. Cowin sent me replacement and the new ones are better.I took off a star because I don't like how the sound quality differs so much between ANC being on or off. It sounds bad and tinny with it off, but sounds great with it on. It is also different if you play through aux. I think it sounds best through bluetooth and ANC on.",4,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0

They do more than an amazing job for the great price. I would buy them again in a minute. Have only been using them for a few weeks so far, so no complaints yet.They easily cancel out the noise of my children so I can concentrate on working from home and taking classes, working on my degree. So much easier to study and and do school work without the noise of arguing children or video games in the background. Noise canceling alone does not block the noise completely, though I have nothing to compare them to as I’ve never used NC headphones before. But with some sort of music on, I usually listen to movie scores or “study music” like beach sounds etc, the NC works great and I only see my children’s lips moving.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

My Sony headphones don't have a long battery life and these had such positive reviews, I thought I'd try them out.They are fantastic with two drawbacks - the circle shape is not contour to the ear shape so they can get uncomfortable after a while. Secondly, and most important, you have to turn them on to use them as normal headphones (even if you don't need the noise cancellation feature). For example, if I want to go on a walk and listen to music, they have to be charged to work. With my Sony and Bose headset, I could use a normal AUX cable and they would work like normal (no battery needed). I only needed to charge them to use the NC feature on flights. Overall, they were well packaged, good sound and long battery life.",3,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"I bought these ""noise cancelling"" headphones for plane trips and my daily train commute. At no time have they cancelled any significant portion of the noise I am hearing. Pairing them is a problem; they seem to ""forget"" my iPhone and other mobile devices. Worst of all, when paired with some devices, the playback of music is stuttering, staccato-like. I can't recommend them.ETA: The Bluetooth playback is a joke. When I plug an audio cord directly into the phones, the sound is lush and lovely. The bass is deep and rich. But if I attempt to use these as wireless headphones, I get nothing but static and staccato playback. I have gone through every forum, tried every solution, and my conclusion is that Cowin just does not know how to write Bluetooth software. Again, the wired playback is fantastic, but don't bother trying to use the Bluetooth or noise cancelling features.",1,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0

"I just opened them yesterday (09/23). The headphones work fine when Bluetooth (BT) is on, but not during Active Noise Canceling (ANC). During ANC, one of the headphones crackles loudly to the point where it hurts my ears and you can't hear other audio. I can tell that ANC would work great otherwise since the other side still functions without the static. I'm really disappointed and debating on whether to return these and buy something else, or try to get another pair that possibly functions. Hopefully this is a fluke because I really liked this pair.EDIT (09/26): I charged these headphones for a couple of days and I'm not sure what happened, but suddenly ANC is working. There's no static anymore, which is great. I have decided to cancel my return (fingers crossed not impulsively). I've been listening to music the last few hours while writing a paper for class and have no complaints. I'm very pleased with the sound quality now.

"Purchased December of 2018.After almost a year of enjoyment, the COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones developed an annoying beeping noise that I can clearly hear over music and my audible book.  The headphones can be plugged into my cell phone or computer, and the lousy beeping sound is always present.  I initially thought the annoying beeping sound might be a built in reminder to charge the headphones.  Nope.  Headphones are fully charged and the annoying beeping sound continues to occur.  My purchase of the $59.99 COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones was a complete waste of money.  Six months into the purchase, there is zero product support.

It can get the loudest I've ever heard headphones get but beware people can hear the audio coming from them on the lowest setting. Also, no bass really. Charging cord is literally like 6inches. Not sure why or who thought that would be a great idea but you DEFINITELY can't use them while charging, not because they don't work while charging but because the cord that came with them are as long as a finger.

"I can hear the bass and the sound is just clear and of great quality. I didn't choose these headphones for noise canceling quality so I don't have much of an opinion about it, but from what I can tell, it does the job. I don't hear fans or people talking far away or the rumble of a washing machine, if that helps. The sound volume is louder than other headphones I've used which is a plus. Battery life lasts a long time. I use mine about 2-3 hours a day, and I finally charged them on the eighth day. Bluetooth works seamlessly with my Samsung Note 9. Doesn't bleep out or anything when I exercise. I don't recommend doing situps or pushups since the headphones fall off my head and it's at the tightest function... I also noticed when I was running, I could hear the smallest clunky noise from the metallic plastic smacking against my glasses. Didn't affect my run, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Maybe noise canceling will take that out, huh? :) my ears get sweaty after running an hour but it's pretty sweat proof, I suppose. Id still recommend wiping it down with a wet wipe for sanitation purposes.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"Charged for 4 hours as per instructions. Nonetheless, the first thing I noticed was the extremely poor sound quality. I make an analogy to videos: if 1080 P is considered good the resolution on the sound from these headphones rates 900 TV lines.  One could not discern the separate instruments in music as one can do on good headphones. Moreover, the volume continually vacillated going up and down.  In addition, the music sounded like it was being played through a speaker covered by a pillow! Parts of the headphones appear to be made of cheap trashy plastic, particularly the parts which hold each headphone to the headband and if one accidentally dropped them, one would have a breaking good time.

With so many good reviews its hard not to think that maybe just my luck and they just had a bad run.  Just got a pair of these and when I put them on sitting on my couch listing to music they sound great. But when I got up and started walking around my house I noticed that they were making a clicking sound. It only happens when the the noise cancellation is on. Its very loud and annoying. I want these for when I am mowing the lawn and I would not be able to listen to them with that sound. I returned the first pair for a replacement which came very prompt. I was thinking maybe I just got a bad pair (it happens). But the second set did the same thing and the volume down button doesn't work. So I will be returning them as well. I don't think I will be trying a third time. With so many good reviews its hard not to think that maybe just my luck and they just had a bad run.,1,1,2020-1-8,1,2,0
"I'm not a big music aficionado when it comes to bass, treble, or quality. I know when music sounds good and it gets loud enough to jam. That said these earphones are very comfortable and provide good sound. Depending on what they are linked to, the sound level can be sub-par but only because of the device that is transmitting the music. My Samsung phone has always sucked at getting a loud sound to anything it bluetooth with or links by cable. So if you experience sub-par sound it is more likely the device and not these headphones. They are lightweight and do an excellent job of encasing the ears to block sounds. Sound is not completely eliminated from entering the headphones but you get a richer music without the outside ambient noises of a/c or electronic humming. Definitely recommend them for price and meeting expectations based on that price. If I wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for the best I would've bought the best. I got what I paid for.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"I've owned two Beats bluetooth headphones prior to buying these headphones. Both lasted me several years each. When the second pair finally gave up the ghost, I decided I'd try non-Beats headphones because I was tired of spending two or three hundred dollars for headphones. I wouldn't say that, overall, the sound is equal to Beats headphones; but the bass is certainly much stronger and the rest of the audio spectrum is still excellent. If you like listening to music with a driving beat, for example, I'm listening to AronChupa - I'm an Albatraoz right now, you will be impressed with the quality of the bass. Another pleasant surprise was the fact that I was able to connect to my iMac and MacBook Pro, something neither of my Beats headphones were able to do. I could only connect to my iPhone and iPad. But the Cowin E7 headphones connect to all of my devices, quickly and easily. One drawback is that the headphones are LARGE and honestly look ridiculous when you wear them. If you don't give a damn what people think of you, and care more about sound quality than your ego, or you primarily will be using them at home, I'd strongly advise getting these amazing headphones.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I needed a new set of headphones after my last died after too short of a time so I did a bit of research and came across the Cowin E7.  The reviews made the decision easy.  Thankfully the reviews I had read were spot on because I LOVE my Cowin E7s.  They are a fun purple color, the noise cancellation works great and honestly most of the time I don't have that feature turn on and they still keep most noises out.  I've only used the built in microphone once but it worked quite well.  I use these daily and I  only have to charge them every 3 or 4 days.  I use them mostly to listen to music, audiobooks or to pair them with my Amazon Fire TV stitch while I watch tv and my Cowin's work great!  They are comfortable and lightweight.Update 02.05.2020",5,1,2019-5-4,1,0,0
"I purchased my headphones after a lot of research and considering cost and value (I could have gone cheap, but then, quality suffers).  In the end, these ones had excellent reviews and comments and I must agree with them.  Perhaps the only bone I have to pick is that the battery lasts for so long the warning tone about it being low caught me by surprise.  I also noted that the sign to indicate that it's full is that the red light on the headphone stops blinking.  Now, I must say that I prefer to listen to music with this headphones and my iPod, but TV shows and movies have a very decent sound too, just not as good as the old Bose headphones I have.  I must say that I'm very pleased with the built quality, comfort and sound (bass especially), and I can recommend them without reservation.EDIT:  A year after purchase, these headphones still work as well as the first day.  Even though I don't use the noise cancellation feature very often, I can say it works very well in combination with listening to music (tried during a transatlantic flight).  I am wearing them in a car (not driving), once a week, connected to my iPod, and they're comfortable beyond belief.  I like the fact that, if needed, I can turn them on or off in the dark, because the switch is very easy to locate with one's fingertips.  I don't doubt they'll survive one more year, but I'll update my review only if I found an issue with them by then.  Otherwise, buyers, go ahead!  You'll get them for a lot less than I paid! :)",5,1,2018-8-7,1,0,0
"Useless after 4 months! Besides the fact that they are incredibly uncomfortable, they’ve stopped functioning after 4 months. The volume is turned up all the way but it isn’t even close to loud enough. They drop connection frequently, have weird issues like they stay connected after turning them off and I have to unplug the TV to get them to disconnect. Load of garbage! Uncomfortable enough to actually hurt your ears after a short time.",1,1,2019-4-28,1,3,0
Ive had to get this pair of headphones replaced once already because the hinges break and ive noticed thats one of the main problems in the reviews.They got a updated version but its almost 40$ extra all they need to do is just use metal swivel hinges thats all they need to fix the problem on this model.,1,1,2019-1-7,1,3,1
"I originally bought these headphones in 2018, and I've been using them pretty consistently over the past two years. They're comfortable, easy to use, and have good sound quality (although I'm no audiophile, so I can't really provide more info on the quality of lows/highs/midrange).So all-in-all, fairly good quality, but not really enough to motivate me to write a review. The reason I've felt compelled to write one now is a recent experience I had with customer support. A few weeks ago, the left headphone started intermittently playing static at full volume instead of whatever I was trying to listen to, which was pretty jarring and annoying, as you can imagine.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"I got these so I could have some over-ear headphones to use at work to block out office noise and focus. They work great over Bluetooth and using the included audio cable - in fact, you can use both at the same time, i.e. have it plugged into my desktop PC and connected to my phone via Bluetooth.I've never used active noise cancelling headphones before this, I wasn't sure what exactly was supposed to be filtered out. It filters out rhythmic noise - fans, air conditioning, hard drive spinning, etc. If you have nothing playing, it actually makes other sounds like speech more distinct, albeit quieter due to covering your ears.",5,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0
"I bought these to block noise and chatty neighbors in an open office environment. The noise cancelling feature works pretty well. I can still hear some background noise, but it reduces the sound enough that it's not distracting. Sometimes I listen to music too, and the sound quality is good. I haven't noticed any static with or without the noise cancelling on. I've tested the microphone and it seems to work well for calls. There are a two things I wish were a little different. The first is that the quietest possible volume is still medium loud. I like music to fade into the background when I'm working, and these don't get quite as quiet as I'd like. Since I mostly only use the noise cancelling I'm okay with that. The second thing is, I wish they were designed to fold up a little smaller. I wanted to try these for noise cancellation when flying, but they're too bulky to pack in my backpack along with all the other items I need. I'll be sticking with my earbuds for planes. Final note - I could foresee that some people's ears would get uncomfortably hot and sweaty when using these. I doesn't bother me at my desk, but I wouldn't use them for exercise.",4,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"I bought this for my trip to Australia.  I wanted something to help keep the noise down on the plane.  They did great.  The sound quality was a little tiny when the noise cancelling function was turned on, but overall sound quality was pretty good for the price.  Then, while still in the protective case that was recommended, it fell about 2 feet. Slid off the bed onto a carpeted floor.  The vital component that allows the ear peices to swivel broke.  I should say the first pair broke with no idea how they broke.  Bought a second pair because they were fantastic headphones.  After charging them, placed in case. They slid off the bed and bam. They broke.  DO NOT BUY THESE, or at least, wrap them in about a foot of bubble wrap it you place them anywhere other than the floor.Update:",5,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0
"I ordered these as a part of the Prime Day deals, and had read some overall positive reviews about the product. Overall, the look and feel of the headphone is pretty good. There's a satisfying weight to them, and they offer pretty decent sound. The headphones feel pretty comfortable, and it seemed like something that I could comfortably wear for 2hrs at a time.However, one glaring issue was pointed out to me when my wife walked into the room, and started laughing. She said ""I hope you're looking to entertain everybody else along with you, as I can hear everything that you're listening to"". I was somewhat hesitant to believe her, wanting these to work in the way I had imagined they would. However, she encouraged me to put the headphones on her head, and walk away from her. Upon her hitting the play button on my phone, I could distinctly hear every word and note that was being blared from these headphones, and it was LOUD. If you want to get a better idea of what it was like, put your phone on 40% volume, play music out of the phone speaker, and step 10 feet away from it. That's how loud it was.",2,1,2019-8-13,1,1,0
"I bought this product solely for my 3 year old to use in a 14 hour flight. I own the bose noise canceling ones. The COWIN does a decent job, specially when compared to the headphones provided by the airline. Obviously, they are not as good as the bose, but this was expected given the price. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the connector of the audio cable broke inside the airplane’s tv jack, leaving the headphones and the tv useless for about 12 hours. We had to change seats and headphones and one of us was very unhappy for an uncomfortable long period of time. I you are planning to use with the cable in a plane, make sure to have a spare cable. We bought a cable for the way coming back and had no further issues. Amazon did refund us the price of the cable, after the fact, but the headphones and cable are now in a drawer waiting for a next flight (which does not happen that often for us).",1,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I have been using these for almost three months now. I have used them on two cross country (U.S. East coast to West coast and back) flights, and they were superb.

Throughout the rest of the trip, the only thing I heard was my audiobook.The charge time/listen time is remarkable!

"I use these headphones for transcribing and the sound is great.  Tiny details in people speaking comes through clearly.  I have a mechanical keyboard that's pretty loud, so the noise canceling is a must.  These work great for that.However, there have been a lot of times that I just take the headset off and go do something else and forget to turn them off.  When I come back to a dead battery, it's frustrating that I can't use them wired while the battery is charging.  Actually, I've never even used them as wireless.  I've now put up a sticky to turn off my headset.  This seems silly.",4,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"These are fantastic! Although, I wish it had more bass the sound is really pretty good...and I feel this may be a little bit of an understatement.  Everything is clear and the noise cancelling is on par to my husband's BOSE earphones.  I had him sing a song while wearing them and had the TV on and I couldn't hear a thing except the music coming out of the earphones.  If you're on the smaller side, they are a little big but not anything too annoying to deal with.  Over the ear headsets are on the bigger side anyway.  I got these yesterday and wore them for about 2 hours, the only thing that worries me is when you adjust the earphones or take a heavy step (like going down stairs) while audio is playing, there is noticeable static like a wire is loose or something. I don't know if all of these do this or just mine but if you're thinking about wearing these to work out with just keep that in mind, there may be a little static when/if running or doing cardio.  It goes away instantly once adjustments have been made or you're walking normally. So weight training-yes cardio-maybe.  I read a lot of reviews on here and I haven't read this to be a problem so I think it just might be me.  The materials are decent quality especially for the price so I'm hoping they last me a decent amount of time.  I wish I could give these 4.5 stars because they really deserve it.",4,1,2017-6-28,1,1,0

"I bought this product in September of 2018. The sound quality of these are fairly decent. The bulk of the headphones can take some getting used to, but overall the ear cushion feels comfortable. The noise cancelling function was about on-par with what I would expect. It diminishes the surrounding noise, doesn't get rid of it. (that is what they are supposed to do)What irritates me is just over a year of purchasing it, it fell apart. Just past the warranty date. I've attached some pictures to illustrate what I'm talking about.",3,1,2019-10-29,1,0,1

I wonder if there is a pair I can get that will cancel out a wife's voice?The sound quality is good. I mainly listen to audio books so I don't need great sound. They are comfortable.

I can accept things breaking, but I have tried twice to get in contact with the company via their web page and haven't heard anything.  I am really disappointed in the company.

"Got these to work from home without the noise of landscaping, leaf blowers, etc. Noise cancellation works best for continual noise like and engine, it does not block out the sound of a tv or a person talking. However, I find the padded ear covers helpful at making all outside sound just a little quieter. Bluetooth connectivity has not had any issues so far.Weird things I wish were different or could be improved upon: if you plug these in to an AUX, you still need to ""turn them on"" using the switch on the right ear pad. I would think that plugging them in would make them work like corded headphones, that is not the case. The USB charging port and the aux port are both open, and do not come with a cover to keep dust from entering the port. Over time the contacts will not work as well. Last thing, the sound button included on a ear piece is a neat feature. However, it is opposite the way one would think: pressing and holding the top part of the button makes sound quieter and the bottom part of the button makes sound louder.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
I’ve owned and used these for about a month and are the first pair of noise canceling Bluetooth headphones I’ve owned. I’ve not used Bluetooth headphones or earbuds by other manufacturers so can only speak about my experience with this product.Arrived charged so these can be used fresh out of the box. All cables for charging and connecting via 1/8” audio cable included and they paired quickly and easily with my IPhone. The ear pieces are very soft and fit snuggly but not too tight. I used these on two 12-hour flights and they still had a charge.,4,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0

I can't compare quality to other brands but...if nothing else, maybe someone learns that ""Write a review"" does not mean to write a comparison.  This review of the product on its own has no complaints. The material against the ears is soft and doesn't cause any perspiration and the portion that rests atop the head is similarly soft. The headphones cover the ear well and mine aren't tiny.  I found myself switching from standard bluetooth to noise canceling to hear the difference and it really is amazing.

After only 6 months the headphones weren't holding a charge and wouldn't work. I only used it with my MP3 player and never got the directions to connect to my cell phone. Customer service sent me another one and charged me 1% of the cost to replace it.  I didn't understand it but went along with it.  I received the new one and got the directions to pair with my cell phone.  I called a friend and could hear him but he could not hear me.  I tried all the troubleshooting steps and it did not work.  I called Amazon and they told me they could only give me the amount I paid which was 60 cents.  I couldn't believe it.  Amazon was kind enough to offer and exception but I had to pay a restocking fee.  Luckily I was able to get another brand which had a $10 coupon.

"I bought these because it had great reviews and the price seemed reasonable. I was mainly looking for headphones with noise cancelling because I work from home and we have a very annoying neighbor's dog that barks all day and I needed something to help me with my sanity. The noise cancelling isn't super great, I can still hear the dog barking (it's two houses down) BUT it helps. If I do play music or watch Netflix, I can't really hear much, so that's good. The first pair I ordered STOPPED WORKING AFTER A FEW DAYS. It wouldn't charge, even after charging them for several days. The volume buttons didn't work either. I read this is a COMMON PROBLEM. So I called to get a refund and they connected me to the manufacturer and after a short explanation and me letting them know it's a common issue based on other reviews, they quickly sent a new pair. This new pair charges well BUT the volume buttons STILL DON'T WORK. I definitely wouldn't recommend or buy again but at this point they mostly serve their purpose.",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I am returning these, the noise cancellation was not very good.  I wanted to at least partially block out my noisy husband, but the headphones only blocked a little ambient noise, making him louder than ever.  Pretty comfortable, but very heavy, noise canceling is not seamless and is noticeable.  Ambient noise, while greatly improved, was only lowered by about 2/3 and I could hear the constant shhhhh output by the headphones to the point that it made my ears very uncomfortable.  I was hoping these would be the answer as the price is reasonable, but I guess I am going to have to fork out a few (hundred) more $ for something with real noise canceling.  Not the right headphones for an autistic person with loud family members.",2,1,2019-6-24,1,1,0
"These did not work for me AT ALL. I live in Manhattan on the 12th floor of a building. There has been a lot of noise in my neighborhood ... fireworks well before July 4th, loud music, and helicopters hovering. First I tried the headphones alone, playing white noise, I was SHOCKED that I could hear an ice cream truck nearby, and I could hear hovering helicopters. I decided to put construction ear plugs in my ears, so I had ear plugs AND the headphones playing white noise. That was a little better, the hovering helicopters were as muffled as I had expected them to be without the ear plugs in. Eventually the firework noises started, and the headphones were basically useless. There was still way too much noise coming through to prevent me from sleeping. They otherwise appear to be a very well designed product and the packaging is very attractive. Even though I was only playing white noise, the sound quality seemed very good.",2,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0

"These are really nice quality headphones.  They fit comfortably and when listening with them, background noise is virtually eliminated . The initial pairing went smoothly once I identified the power switch. (Don’t laugh! I had not read the instructions)  My only complaint is that I would like to use these in multiple situations. Ex: with my iPad, iPhone, and my TV.  Pairing each of those was not working until I realized that once it is paired to one device, you have to disconnect it before you can pair to another device. This is proving to be a little aggravating.  Maybe this is typical of paired devices?

I don't plan to work out with them often, but bending over or moving around won't be a problem.  I'm not an audiophile, but the sound is very good.  The bass comes through very satisfyingly.

Yay!So I bought these, but they do not live up to the standards that I had with my Bose headphones.  First off, these cannot connect to multiple devices.  I had scoured the product details to see, and it had the feature on there, of being able to connect to multiple devices, however when I connect them to my phone, they are unable to be connected to my laptop or my tablet.

The replacement unit arrived promptly and in full retail packaging. This was clearly a material, design, or manufacturing failure, which Cowin to their credit remedied with a replacement unit, no questions asked.As for the headphones themselves, the sound is very good and they are very comfortable to wear.

I can hear the music, and the sound of the lawn mower is muted; it's a fabulous way to mow the lawn. I have not experienced any issues with them even though once I'm done mowing they are completely covered in sweat. I merely dry them off and put them away til next time. These hold the charge extremely well. I think I only had to charge them once throughout the whole entire season. Now of course since I'm in Western New York, mowing season is only about 4 months.

"The reason I bought these was because some of my devices don't have blue tooth but when I don't have to have a cord, I don't want one.  So, these will work corded or with bluetooth. The fabric is nice and ear pieces are comfortable.  If you have large ears, they may not go completely inside the ear piece (mine fit fine).  I bought another brand for a similar price point about 2 years ago and these sound way better.  I thought it was a bonus feature having the noise cancelling, but if you are getting these because that is a must have feature, I would pass.  To be fair, I have never listened to another set of noise cancelling headphones, but to me, you lose bass and not a lot of noise cancellation.  Honestly, with the sound turned up to only a few bars, you can't hear outside noise anyway, so I don't find that as a huge issue.  Remember, you aren't paying the price for Bose so your expectations can't be Bose like.  For the price, quality and features, I still give these a 5 start.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"Wired headphones to my ears, have a better sound than blue tooth headphones.  Having said that, the Corwin E7s still have a pretty high sound quality and I prefer over the ear headphones to ear pods.  I can hear a difference when listening to speech, but with music, not so much.  I like to wear the Bluetooth headphones when I exercise, or am working in the garage or outside in the yard.  Or, any time where movement is involved and a wired headset can be restrictive.  I like to listen to all kinds of music (rock, jazz, blues, classical, techno, metal, etc.), mainly instrumental,  and usually connect them to streaming music stations on my iPhone.  They aren't a super light headset, but are very comfortable to wear for long periods.  Excellent overall frequency response, especially in the lower registers.  I don't know how long they will run on a charge, but I charge them once a week and have never had them go dead on me yet.  The noise canceling feature is ok.  It attenuates outside sound but not on a scale like a Bose, for example.  If that's important to you, then to get a little bit more noise canceling, be prepared to pay a lot more.  Nonetheless, this headset has a very high quality sound, especially for a wireless, and it's cost is a bargain for what you get.",5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0
"I really liked these headphones when I first got them but now I have two problems with them, one which has rendered them useless. First, the microphone never worked on phone calls for me. No one could hear me at all. Second, and this is why they are useless to me now, I had them paired to a linux machine and they worked nicely. When I disconnected them from bluetooth the blue light stopped blinking and now it is just a solid white light. They no longer work, even while plugged in with the 3.5mm cable. I havn't found a way to reset them. As other reviews have said, there is no way to remove the battery and even if I could I'm not sure it would reset them. After being very pleased, I am now very disappointed.UPDATE**  I fixed the BT connection problem by removing the screw (Very small torx) from the side with the power switch and the cover came off. Then I lifted the black tab holding the small ribbon in place and gently pulled the ribbon out. This effectively disconnected the battery from the circuit board. I waited a minute and plugged the cable back in and reset the black tab. The headphones fired up and acted normal. Hopefully this will help some of you. Unfortunately this didn't fix my microphone issue.",5,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0
"This is actually my second pair of these.  The first pair held up to years of abuse and I loved them, and recommended them to several coworkers.  One of the best features, in my opinion, was that even if I forgot to charge them I could plug them into my phone and still use them as headphones without the noise canceling.  I was quite disappointed to get my new pair and discover that they'd removed that feature.  I'm certinally hoping that this pair lasts as long as my first pair, but once I have to replace these I may look elsewhere, as that feature was valuable to me.",3,1,2019-6-12,1,2,0
"When I first received these, I realized my computer didn't have Bluetooth.  No problem...this headset came with a plug to connect to my computer's headphone connection.  I'm no sound expert but these are wonderful.  They're comfortable, the base is really good and I'm very happy with them.  Charging is easy.  Haven't had to use noise cancelling yet.  I share an office with another person so it can get noisy when they talk.  My old headset was just not cutting it.  But THESE...they have to be right next to me yelling for me to hear them.  I would highly recommend these.  They are half the price of the set my office companion purchased and perform just as well.  Purchased a Bluetooth dongle so now they are cord free and they work GREAT!",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"First off all, these sound truly awful.  And it's hard to describe how bad they sound because the way they work is so quirky.  There are two settings on the switch, BT (essentially normal) and NC (noise cancelling).  BT switch sounds thin and weak.  NC switch is *all* bass.  You better have a really good EQ.  I was able to get an almost passable sound through one app that had a full graphic equalizer by cutting all the bottom frequencies as far as they could go.But I also wanted this for a headset for Zoom calls etc., and the microphone is absolute garbage.  I sound like a distant AM radio station.  Once I started using it, people on the calls would start complaining about how garbled and distant my voice sounded.  So I went back and watched recordings of some of the meetings and sure enough, it was really bad.",1,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"I am an audiophile. I have owned headphones from high end to pure garbage. These headphones are the greatest in their class and price range. They are “colored”, meaning they are not suited for mixing audio in a professional situation such as I do. However, for music listening, yard mowing and movie watching, these performed beyond my expectations. The best $60 you’ll spend this year. You’ll spend $120 + trying to get a better sound out of a set of cans (which I already did for you. You’re welcome ;)",5,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"My wife has been recommending that I purchase some Noise Canceling Headphones for me to be able to wear to block out the constant, unwanted noise that comes from our 2 kids.  She said that I needed these especially for lengthy car rides...as the kids get annoyingly loud and my Anxiety Meds only help so much...I had been hesitant to buy myself any...as they can be really expensive and I knew nothing about how to determine what kind would be a good value but still made well.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,1

I can ride my bike and talk to people, I have switch my music track, voice commands and all the good stuff. I used my headphones for apps 12-18 hours a day. Charged them two to three times in the week and bass is beyond delicious.",1,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"Edit 9/5/19: Customer service reached out to me and is replacing them, they allowed me to choose a sturdier looking pair. Which I think is amazing. I am raising my review for that. Because they are standing behind their product. Which does foster a confidence in them and the product.The sound was good. The noise canceling gave him a headache. And one of the ear cup things rotated way too far around immediately when he got it. But he thought it was supposed to and never told me until he had had it for a few months and one day asked me why the one turned so much and the other didn't and I looked at it and it was broken. And very shortly after that he fell asleep sitting on the couch wearing them, it slid off his head, and the broken cup finished breaking.",5,1,2019-8-15,1,0,0
"One of the earpads on my Bose headphones had started to rip out of the speaker and I decided a new pair was in order. I never liked the cord on my headphones getting tangled in my office chair and started looking at wireless ones. I looked at quite a few and found these had a reasonable price and very good reviews. I couldn't be happier, they connected easily to the bluetooth on my computer and have at least for me awesome sound quality and best of all no more cord. The only thing I really noticed is that the bass is much stronger than on my Bose headphones and actually sound better to me than the Bose. All in all I would highly recommend these to someone looking for wireless and not wanting to spend a fortune on paying for a name.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones bc I needed something wireless initially, the sound cancelling was a bonus.I’ve been using them for about a week or so (I will update this once more time passes) but so far I’m loving them.

"As many others have reviewed these broke out of the blue. There was no dropping or damage to them but because of the ear pieces having the ability to swivel so they can be stored flat, it WILL wear out. I haven't even had these a year and I'm very careful with them. I'm very disappointed and will be looking elsewhere for a replacement. I also can't say I found them very noise cancelling but they did provide some masking of outside sound.UPDATE: Cowin did reach out to me regarding my review. I appreciate the refund I was given and so I do give them kudos for good customer service to me and standing behind their product but still wish the product would've lasted as they were very comfortable headphones.",3,1,2019-1-17,1,2,0
UPDATE:I was contacted by the manufacturer with some information. It appears I received a faulty item. They are working with me to get a replacement unit shipped to me.

"I really like my first pair of cowin headphones, but after about a year and a half one of the earpieces seemed to just come loose. No sound came from the speaker, and it had no structural integrity. I bought a second pair, and after about a year and a half the same thing happened. I'm a heavy user so I did get a lot of play out of it, which means the low price point is a relief. That being said, I'm done getting these headphones. I'd rather get a pair of headphones with a higher price point that sounds better, has actual active noise cancellation (the noice cancellation in these headphones is a joke/pretty much a lie), and won't break in 18 months.",2,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"After 5 months I can safely say that these headphones are a great bang for your buck if you are looking for a higher end feel without spending over a hundred bucks.The sound quality is fairly good, but it’s not a breathtaking feeling when putting them on. Also, the noise canceling was a little disappointing if you’re looking for something to wipe out the sounds of a tv or busy office. However, if using them for music they do a fairly decent job of blocking out noise with the volume a decent way up, and the Bluetooth works great with anything that has a dedicated Bluetooth adapter or a mobile device.",4,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"So my friend and I both have issues with wired headset's cords getting snagged and loosened and all over time, so we looked for wireless and got these together only a day apart. He still hasn't gotten his after waiting 3 almost 4 days as a prime member with 1 day shipping, but I've had mine for a couple days now and so far this is what I think.Noise cancellation is better than my last headset, however the sound quality sounds all muffled and is not great for gaming at all especially if you need to listen closely for some FPS games and such. The mic from what I can tell with tests and my friend's feedback is like ""old Xbox 360 mic quality"" in his words which I can only say means it's pretty bad and, if you're loud people wont be able to understand what you're saying at all. Now for my biggest issue? you can only use the stereo audio or the mic, never both. When you use the mic for say discord or a call of some sort it changes all audio on your desktop to the ""E7 Hands-Free"" instead of ""E7 Stereo"" and E7 Hands-Free has even worse audio quality, which means even if you go into your sound settings and figure out how to switch everything to E7 Hands-Free audio so you can talk to friends and play at the same time, you'll have much, much worse audio quality than with E7 Stereo.",2,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
"I wanted some noise cancelling headphones to use around the house that let me listen to podcasts, even if I'm vacuuming or washing dishes. These ones do the job. There are plenty of more expensive brands that cost $200-$400. These COWIN E7 headphones fit a balance in price (only $60) and functionality. In addition I can talk on the phone with them. The controls on the right side of the head set took me a couple days to get comfortable with just by feel. But after a little practice, it's easy to pause, play, skip, adjust the volume, or answer a phone call. If you're looking for sport headphones, these are too big for running. But I took them on a bike ride once and they worked fine. They are not quite as small and sleek as some higher-end ones, but they do the job. They cup around the ears and are comfortable.  I'm happy with my purchase. I gave 4 stars for sound quality because some times the  audio isn't perfect on phone calls.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I like these headphones a great deal. For the price, the sound and noise cancellation are excellent. However, don't expect the isolation of a much more expensive pair. They are comfortable to wear for an extended periods. I've worn them for several hours without issue. Setup was simple, same as any other Bluetooth device.  It comes with a leather holding bag but I don't find that of much use. There is also a headphone case customized for these headphones that is sold separately.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,1,0
"Please take into consideration this is the first pair of NC headphones I've owned so I really don't have a basis for comparison.  That being said, I put these on today and I was amazed.  My cubicle has progressively gotten more noisy (I'm next to a call center) and these headphones, while playing music, completely drown out the surrounding noise.  Without music it definitely mutes it, but I can still hear a little of my surroundings - mostly the higher pitch voices.  The sound quality is a lot better than I expected.  They are comfortable (perhaps a little tight on my larger-than-average head), but I do need to adjust the ear pieces every 30 minutes or my ears become annoyed.  These even mostly drown out the sound of my own keystrokes on my keyboard as I rapidly type out this review.",5,1,2019-8-15,1,0,0
"I dont know how well the noise cancelling really works.  I mean I cant hear much over the music or what I'm watching so pretty decent I guess.  But as far as a head set, their pretty good.  I'm sure they don't compete with the high dollar head phones but they are far better than the three other sets I've over the last two years.  Battery life is actually really good.  I don't charge them that often, but for how much I use them, I haven't had them go dead on me yet.  I have to wear a head set in my profession so a crappy set of head phones isn't going to fly.  These E7's are very comfortable.  Over all, I'm happy with the purchase.  Its hard for me to drop the money on one of those high dollar sets.

The noise canceling function worked great!  I was able to hear everything I watched very well with very little distracting outside noise.  Best of all, I did not get one of those ""headaches"" that often come with wearing a set of headphones too long.The only downside of these headphones was the soft bag case that they came in; because the headphones are a little bulky, they did not fit well inside the soft bag case, and there was not a pocket or some other way to separate the cord from the headphones within the bag; you just have to shove everything into the bag and pull the drawstring in order to try to shut it, though the bulk of the headphones, no matter which way I tried to put them in, prevented the bag from being closed all the way.",5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
UPDATE: 1-year Warranty only applies if bought from Cowin website. ** Headphones broke within a year.  Awaiting a reply from Cowin but based on their website I am not entitled to the 1-year warranty because I bought the phones from Amazon. FIRST REVIEW: Fair value. Noise cancellation is a separate setting from the setting for listening to music.  I didn’t expect Bose quality but hoped for some level of integration. Padding is soft so the phones are comfortable.  Battery life is good. I can’t comment on the 30H rating. I wish they were made in the USA; I’d pay more to know they were made by the hands of Americans.,2,1,2019-11-14,1,1,1
"Without asking or reaching out to them. Cowin sent me another pair of E7s that perform much better. Maybe I had a defective pair or this is  new hardware revision, but I noticed the sound quality doesn't degrade when I activate the noise-cancellation and people can hear me through the headset's microphone now. Music and movie sound quality is as expected now.Pretty decent product for the price and I am impressed with the level of customer service from just an Amazon review.  Below is my original Amazon review. It may be worth reaching out to them",4,1,2017-10-28,1,2,0
"I honestly don't have a whole lot to compare to, I honestly bought these because I wanted noise cancelling headphones but didn't want to spend $300.  That being said, these work great, I've charged them once and have used them for a total of about six hours so I cannot comment too much on battery life (hence the 4 star rating) however the range is decent, I was able to walk around my house without loss of connectivity or quality.  The sound reduction by the headphones WITHOUT the noise cancelling on is pretty decent they fit over my entire ear, but with the noise cancelling on it muffles sharp sounds and almost erases (to my ear) background noises like fans or a running fridge. They're also pretty sturdy and do NOT feel cheap at all. They're also comfortableOverall, I would purchase again so far. $60 on a decent pair of headphones that let me block out distractions and focus is all I wanted and this does the trick.",4,1,2019-3-5,1,0,0
"HUGE ISSUE: When in noise cancelling mode, it frequently, and randomly, plays a FULL volume high pitched sound and sometimes won't resent for a long time. I have no idea what this is, but I've had people in the other room quickly walk to my door to ask me what the hell that noise was, it's really loud and scary to have right next to your ears in the headphones.OTHERWISE:",2,1,2018-3-31,1,2,0

"I am happy with this choice. The active noise cancellation is pretty decent although not incredible; I mostly use it when using machinery, like mowing. It blocks out quite a bit of the noise but I have to turn up my music quite loud to hear it which sort of defeats the purpose of the noise cancelling. The quality of the sound is pretty decent, certainly good enough for enjoying music whilst doing chores (I am a recording engineer so I have professional headphones to which I compare them as far as sound quality). The fit is good and doesn't make my ears too terribly hot (but pretty warm). Build quality is quite good. I do not use the Bluetooth feature so cannot comment on that, I use the 1/8 inch input.My only wish is that I wish it blocked sound more completely.",4,1,2017-6-14,1,2,0
"UPDATE 8/21/19:  The replacement headset (OUCOMI Active Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones) that I got back in September 2018 to replace my broken Cowin set conked out.  The right ear got staticky and then went out completely within the same day.  Thank goodness I had the unopened replacement Cowin set that Laurence (see 9/10/18 update) had sent me.  I really do love these. They are a little tighter on the ears than other headphones I've owned, but for sound and noise cancellation, there are none better.  I only hope they last longer than the last ones I bought (and that Laurence replaced), but again, their customer service is over and above any I've dealt with for any product, not just headphones.UPDATE 9/10/18:  Out of the blue I was contacted via email by Laurence from Cowin. Unprompted, he was letting me know that he'd read my review (see below) and that the headphones were still under warranty.  He offered to send a new pair (I didn't even have to send the broken ones back), or they would refund my money if I'd already gotten a new pair. I opted for a new pair, and the day after Labor Day (five calendar days after his initial contact), I got my brand new pair in the mail. Didn't even have to give my address, credit card, etc. They sent it based on my initial purchase.  Never heard of a company that stood behind its product like that, actually seeking out the customer to make good on a warranty.  AMAZING customer service and a product I can now heartily recommend.",4,1,2018-4-11,1,0,0
"If you want 110% noise cancellation performance, go get the Bose. If you're after value, and are ok with 90% noise cancellation, these are your headphones. I purchased a pair of these for my wife and I for an international trip, and we were both happy with them. All functions, including bluetooth, worked flawlessly. After the initial charge before our trip, I used them on our departing & returning flight, and they still have an ample charge. While the noise cancellation isn't as great as the top-dollar options, I easily managed to sleep on a plane with a crying toddler nearby due to these headphones.

Okay so I've had these for about a year and I definitely got more than my moneys worth on these.Why I am impressed: I just noticed that I have not charged these in mayb 4-5 days and they still have not died and stayed consistent. I'm a grad student and I'm always on the go so I often forget to charge my electronics. I don't even worry about charging these anymore because they last that long on one charge... and the sound does not cut off at all until it's absolutely about to die with a couple beeps warning before hand which I appreciate.,5,1,2018-4-25,1,0,0

"I have had my E7's for a few weeks now so I feel confident I can write a fair assessment of these headphones. Bottom line, they are worth every penny and then some. If you're looking for a wireless noise canceling headphone for around $50, these will not disappoint. They come snugly packaged in an elegant box with a carrying pouch, aux cable and charging cord. They feel sturdy and look amazing, as good if not better than any $100+ set. I have worn them almost daily on my 1hr commute and also while I run power tools in my wood shop. The sound is great, and more than meets my needs. The noise cancelling is phenomenal and I can now happily listen to music while I run my table saw, routers and other notoriously loud tools. And they are COMFORTABLE! I have a top of the line gaming headset I use with my computer that I constantly need to adjust after only a short while. The Cowin headset I have worn for 6+hrs solid with no complaints. I have read the negative comments about this headset failing after months or years but I can’t really speak to that. I will say that given how solid they feel, I can't imagine them breaking unless you grossly mishandle them. Do yourself a favor, stop reading and just buy these.",5,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0

In addition, now, after 30 days, with a brand-new computer,  it skips badly after just a few seconds connected via bluetooth even on a full charge.

"I bought these primarily to use while I was mowing the lawn and doing yard work. They seemed to work well. I don't think they actually do any real noise canceling (not actively, at least), but they blocked out a fair amount of noise and I could hear my podcasts while I worked. After about a year of roughly weekly use, they started dropping the bluetooth signal from my phone that was in my pocket. It started out as irregular, at first, but, over the last few months, it became pretty constant - every 10 seconds or so it would drop the signal and I couldn't hear my podcasts. I tried re-connecting the headphones with my phone and adjusting various settings. I then bought some new bluetooth headphones to see if it was my phone. The new ones (a different brand) work perfectly. It's not my phone. It's these. They worked fine for about a year but now are useless. I know they aren't super expensive, but I'd like more than a year's worth of use for the price.[UPDATE: In August of 2019, someone from COWIN reached out to me because of this review. They said they would replace the headphones for free in return for me updating my review. I added a star to my review for the good customer service. I appreciate their willingness to try to make customers happy. That is laudable.]",3,1,2019-4-6,1,0,0
"I bought these about 7 months ago and use them while working at my desk to cancel out my noisy work colleagues as well as on long flights to either sleep or listen to movies. These work great and were a 5 star up until a couple of weeks ago when a short occurred in the aux jack in the headphones. Unless I have the jack in the perfect spot it will intermittently miss and cut in and out. When the jack sits perfect or I use the bluetooth, then they work perfect. However, when I am traveling on a plane, especially on a long 8-13 hour stretch, I have to have the cord to hook into the movie screen. It is annoying with the short in the aux jack.UPDATE: The left earphone now whines when the headphones turn on initially, then after about 30 seconds it makes the sound like a flat tire makes if you were to drive on it. After my initial review about the aux jack, I did receive an email from Cowin and they offered to replace my headphones and I accepted but never heard anything more from there nor did I receive a replacement pair.",1,1,2019-5-3,1,1,0

I have a noise aversion as in I struggle with overly loud music always have and high volume sounds emergency vehicles trains etcetera. I live with it accept it but it’s a struggle because the noisy people could care less and the noise keeps increasing. So I became aware of these headphones that cancelled sound a while back and they were about 3x my budget for a year, i waited, and moved where I am and they became crucial to my survival. I appreciate them as the headphones  block the sound enough that I can focus again. I can say for phone calls there are some small improvements that might be made perhaps where the microphone picks up voice. Otherwise I have only had 3-4 phonecalls that were issue out of a dozen.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0

I had absolutely no problems with this product until it came apart at a joint and is no longer easy to use.EDIT: I wrote this review 2 years ago now. The headphones eventually lost all use and stopped producing sound shortly after posting the first review.

"After listening to a coworker’s Cowin E7 Bluetooth headphones I just had to own one so I immediately ordered. As soon as I received it I opened the box and just the appearance of the headphones alone will take you back. It’s nice and sleek. The sound quality speaks for itself. As soon as you put the headphones on it’s like you entered a concert. You don’t hear anything but the music. The Bluetooth allows you to be mobile with your headphones without the hassle of extra wiring. The battery life itself is on another level. I haven’t had to charge my headphones much since receiving them a couple days ago so that’s great for long workouts, trips, or whatever else you like to get into while accompanied by music.

"I bought these headphones for my kid and ended up wishing I bought them for myself. They are more comfortable and sound better than my Hesh 2 wireless headphones.The battery life is good. The case it came in is really nice and my kid felt like he was getting something a lot more expensive than what I paid. Let me be clear, it's not a ""kids headphones."" These are high quality adult headphones.",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"I love the sound quality and was very disappointed when they broke today. I bought them in March of this year. Will not buy another COWIN product. Not durable enough for heavy use, as I use them all day, every day. Very disappointed in the durability. This product is shown to have an 18 month warranty. I demand replacement or full refund!In just a few days after this review, I received an email from Cowin Customer Service offering an upgraded replacement at no cost to me. The SE7's are on their way and i will review them in a few months.  Five stars to Lexi Snow at Cowin Customer Support. She was helpful and sympathetic to my problems with the device.",1,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0
"I've had these headphones for 2-3 years and they have been amazing. I'll admit I haven't taken care of them the best but they have taken a beating. The sound quality is pretty good given the price range. I've used the noise cancellation a lot and have enjoyed how good they are at noise canceling. I wore them for at least 6 hours every day and I would say they're a 4/5 in terms of comfort. They recommend removing them every hour or so. But if left on long, it can become uncomfortable. The earpads and the overhead arch-thing are made of synthetic material and will wear down/detach from the headphones over time. Things like sweat will accelerate this breakdown. The design of them is simple, minimal and sleek. Some other headphones are ginormous or have too much going on in terms of design.I would highly recommend these headphones! (Or get the newer version of these headphones found elsewhere on here).",5,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0
These BLACK HEADPHONES are wonderful .....they are plastic and i really like the quality. Bought the colored ones for MOM....the paint came off....think it is like that with all the colors....the way they are painted. I would recommend buying the BLACK SET!  This seller was great on fixing my MOMS  letting her replace her colored ones for the black pair and refunded the difference. I told MOM i really liked my Black headphones. Seller was very understanding and helpful and fast. I would stick with the BLACK ones....but they are made different than the BLACK ones.....I would recommend buying this! Just what i wanted. THE Sound is GreaT! Haha...and i cannot hear MOM yell at me....That is soo worth buying these...Hahaha I would BUY from this seller again!,5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"They are kind of cheap with the materials. I suspect that the ear cups will delaminate sooner than you’d like as they feel like they didn’t use high quality material. I’m unsure if the noise cancelling is mostly done by active noise cancelling, or passive. It gets pretty quite when you put them on and I don’t hear any background noise with them on or off. Not like say a Bose aviation headset. On that note, they are not Bose. But they aren’t $300 either. I think you could find a $29 pair that would be nearly the same.",4,1,2019-2-6,1,1,0
"The Headphones have a high quality look and are very well made!  They have such a cool look to them that makes you feel like you are the pilot on the airplane.  The Headphones Have great noise cancellation,  lightweight, and are very comfortable to wear.  I use them on the airplane and  I can put them on and sleep without hearing any noise .  The sound quality is excellent!  I love the fact that the battery lasts 30 hrs.  I have used  The headphones at least four round-trip flights and they still have charge on them.  I love the fact that the earmuffs swivel so you contact them in your bag easily.  I also bought the zipper carry case which fits them perfect.  I purchased  The first pair for my husband, but I love them so much I ordered a second pair for myself.  This will probably be the last pair of Bluetooth headphones you will ever buy.  I definitely recommend them.",5,1,2018-2-7,1,1,0
"I saw that this headset had high reviews so I decided to go with it. Upon receiving it, I noticed that the quality of the headset was made of cheap plastic that felt really flimsy. It worried me about the longevity of the product. I decided to give it a try anyhow and hooked it up to Bluetooth on my PC... sound quality was incredibly low. I even got my IT fiance to try to fix the sound quality and he simply said the headset was poor quality. He tested to see if it was the bluetooth adapter that I also bought on Amazon but after half an hour of checks and balances, it was evident that it was the headset. Returned it immediately after that.TLDR; poor sound and construction quality. Don't buy!!!",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Bought this pair of headphones for watching YouTube videos after my family goes to bed. I didn't care too much about noise cancelling future, not even about the sound quality, which is decent, and I wasn't even aware that it also has a microphone. For the money and for the purpose I purchased them they were more than acceptable. For listening to music I was just about to order a more expensive pair from Cowin. Just when I was prepare to order the new pair the old ones broke apart! I had them for less than a year and I only used them here and there.This is simply unacceptable. If you care about the future of your company you should stop selling these defective headphones.",1,1,2019-6-10,1,1,0
1 Year Update Below Original Review(Original Review),4,1,2016-5-15,1,4,0
"Bought the product to replace my old headphone for work after seeing the high volume of positive reviews. I had some reservation because of some reported issues particularly with the headphone being prone to (1) cutout connection if not sitting still, (2) mechanical break at the swivel connection, (3) bluetooth distance coverage. Though i figured it would be worth trying out given the ostensibly great quality-price value, Amazon easy return policy, and the voluminous overwhelming amount of raving reviews (some sounded so good -- even better than product specs ...) Why wasting company money if i could use a much less expensive product that has reportedly excellent performance and functionality?In short, I tried it and ended up unfortunately quicky returning it. Sound/connectivity did momentarily and annoyingly get disrupted with otherwise normal motion (tested that by walking back/forth to next room from my home office); lost/poor bluetooth connectivity at about 25ft-30ft away from my laptop. The first problem alone was not acceptable even without other reported issues that may come up if I were to keep it.",1,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0
"*EDITED*So originally I had a ton of problems with this headset trying to get it to work on PC. Nothing would work, I had to use external drivers from some shady site to even get bluetooth for this headset to be recognized, and then nothing would register under playback options that this device was even a headset. I returned the headset, got my refund and went on my merry way. Cowin then contacted me, told me that they weren't happy that I didn't like their headset and left them a scathing review and as a token of goodwill they would send me a new set of headphones that they had recently updated their software to make a much better experience for PC users. I thought that they were full of it and there's no possible way they could work, that they were simply trying to buy my review off and get me to change it. But lo and behold, a week later I received a new pair of headphones and when using through bluetooth on both my phone and PC they worked perfectly. No issues. We'll see how they work down the road but as of right now Cowin gained a lot of respect for correcting their mistake and I will gladly look towards their products in the future.",5,1,2017-7-5,1,2,0
"Update 12-20-2019*** The company reached out to me regarding my dissatisfaction.  They offered to replace the headphones with an upgraded set at no charge and apologized for the poor experience I had with these.  We selected their SE7 series foldable headphones to replace our current set.  They are reported to have 30 hour battery life and an upgraded chip.  Out of the box appearance, these are a nice looking pair of headphones.  They are comfortable and appear sturdy.  The sound performance is very good and I am pleased with the replacement pair and hoping they will outperform the previous pair in durability.  Will update again as we get more use time from them.Initial thoughts on these were quite positive.  The sound was good.  The noise cancelling was effective. Purchased as a Christmas present last year.  They have fallen apart.  We have had to creatively tape one headphone back to the over the head piece for several months now and even that isn’t holding them together well.  The sound has of course gotten spotty with the patch job.  I am quite disappointed as I have a pair of skull candy headphones I gave a similar price for and they have lasted 7 years now with no loss of sound and are still all in one piece.",3,1,2019-11-1,1,0,1
"I like these better than the Bohm headphones.  While these are definitely bulkier and heavier, they also fit over the ear better, cancel noise better and sound better.  Even though they are bigger, I found them to be more comfortable. I had 3 flights in 2 days, and these were great for them.  I also wear them around the house when kids are watching TV and I want to listen to music.  I was surprised to see other people in the airport with them too.  I like these headphones a lot.",5,1,2017-4-23,1,2,0
"Excellent Bluetooth over the ears headphones. I am not a fan of ear buds because they just don’t fit correctly and fall out or hurt my ears so it’s good old fashioned headphones for me. Super easy to operate, charge lasts a long time, great sounding (it’s cool picking up things in the background you’ve never noticed otherwise) and you can’t beat the price. I don’t fly so don’t know how they work on a plane with noise cancellation but I wore them recently on a family car trip and I couldn’t hear the chatter or music from car radio which was wonderful. The only downside is the bright blue light when it’s on if you are wearing them in bed. If you are looking for excellent quality at a good price and prefer old school headphones then these are perfect.",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"They call these thing ""noise canceling"".  They don't do that.  I finally got the company to admit that they don't do anything if you're not listening to some audio stream.  Even if I were listening to some audio, how could they cancel noise using only one microphone?  A real noise canceling set would have a microphone on each earpiece so the signals can be made to cancel (thus reducing ambient noise).  These may work fine to just listen to some audio but forget about noise canceling.",1,1,2019-12-30,1,2,0
"The sound and feel of the E7 headphones is fantastic! I can wear them all day at work and they are very comfortable. The noise cancellation is very good. It completely tunes out other noises in the office.I have 2 minor complaints, but doesn't take away from a great pair of headphones.",5,1,2018-8-7,1,0,0
"I bought two pairs, one for each kid. It's not easy finding a decent set of over the ear, noise-cancelling headphones for less than $250 - and I did tons of research before I bought these. My kids both love them. They cut down on arguments b/c they can both enjoy their own music without disturbing the other one. They like the sound quality and they have not once complained about comfort even when wearing for hours at a time. I deduct two stars b/c one of them did come unglued 3 months after purchase, but I add back one star b/c the seller was incredible to deal with. I shot him a note via Amazon, he responded same day with a code for buying a replacement via Amazon (with free next day shipping) and I literally had the replacement set the next day. At t his price, I would recommend.",4,1,2017-12-20,1,1,0
"These are great headphones, I've had my first pair for the family computer for almost a year now and it works perfectly. No issues at all and the Bluetooth connectivity  is convenient and easy to set up. It does not take long to charge at all and will last me about 6-8 hours. I bought a second pair for gaming and it's wonderful in terms of canceling out the sound of my family around me but it isn't completely sound proof. I do also wear glasses so at first it is awkward to have on and after about 3 hours I'll take them off just for comfort but I believe that is just a simple issue. The padding on the ears are soft and don't become an issue until that 3 hour mark for me unlike other headphones I've tried where the cushioning is firm and crushes your ear. This is the best bang for your buck after trying headphones that range from 23-256$, I would recommend these to anyone #sponsorme",4,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0
I got the cowin e 7 headphones 9 months ago there still going strong i paid $59 then got a case months later to protect them the battery life is true i dont need noise canceling  im in a nursing home which is loud at night but all i hear is my movies or shows on Netflix  recently i saw they had the e 7 pro on sale for $59 withe the case included I already purchased them and will do a review on the e 7 pro might not wait 9 months i never registered for the warranty for either pair and hope that doesnt prove to be a mistake not sure if i can still register the e 7 since there 9 months old i think ill call cowin and try to do both pairs at the same time AAAAA+++++++++ head phones never even had to use the noise canceling,5,1,2019-7-26,1,1,0
"I purchased these to have a way to make calls with my computer or phone specifically, but found I liked them so much they have since become daily used for listening to music and watching videos.The bluetooth connection is great for all devices. These are probably one of the fastest connecting headphones I've ever owned and I love that feature. Every time I turn them on I hear the startup sound and seconds later I hear the connection sound. I haven't had them miss the connection instantly yet. My computer had some issues while trying to use the device with Google Meet—the audio wasn't as clear as on mobile devices and the mic wouldn't connect at all—but I think that could be a software issue with my computer as that's the only issue I've ran into with the headphones with bluetooth.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Update to review:I wanted to add that I do not recommend these headphones to anyone who plans on walking or working out while using them.  The headphones do not stay securely over the ear so any movement causes them to shift around wildly, creating this awful electronic scratching noise.",3,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
"The cost difference between these and the ones offered by Bose is significant.  The noise-cancelling may not be as good, but these worked just fine for me on a cross-country flight I just took last weekend.  I am not an audiophile.  I just want to listen to my movies and music without being distracted by airplane noises, and I don't want to disturb anyone else with my choice in movies/music. These are just great for me.  I appreciate what they do, and think they are a great value.",4,1,2017-6-16,1,4,0
"When I originally purchased these headphones, I was blown away with how nice the sound was and how much of a great value these headphones were. Unfortunately, about 10 months or so after purchase, one of the swivel stems broke on the muffs. These headphones did some light travel and I kept them in my work bag, so they really weren't abused. Attached is a picture of my headphones, and unfortunately, the SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY CO-WORKER - hers after about a year of use. Cowin ended up sending a replacement set of headphones. Kudos to the company for caring about their customers. I not only have the E7's, but also the noise cancelling HE5A buds as well. Because of the positive customer service, I'd recommend Cowin - if you have a problem with your unit just reach out to them. Fingers crossed that this pair will last longer than my first set.",4,1,2019-12-11,1,0,1
"Got these based on multiple personal recommendations in my office. There are lots of things I do like about them - comfort on the ears, nice looking design, and flexibility of Bluetooth or wired use. But I have a problem with the frequency response, namely the low end I find very tubby / flabby compared with both my earbuds and my studio headphones. Turning noise reduction on attenuates not only ambient hum/rumble but also bass response in the audio, which doesn’t make much sense to me. But basically I need to have the ANR on to get a pleasurable bass response regardless of whether I want to use ANR or not. Otherwise the bass just sounds a bit overdone and cheap like old time “mega bass.” I’m not going to return them as I see them as being a nice cold weather commute option. But I’d wish for a more natural frequency response if possible.",3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Pros:  The battery life is really good, they really do last around 30 hours in normal mode and 20 hours in noise cancelling mode.  The active noise cancelling is very good, also, easily overcoming the noise at the unfashionable end of a 777.  But the main thing is they sound amazing!!  The ANC does lessen the depth of the sound a little, but not to the point that they sound bad.  They come with a cool pleather bag, too.Cons:  Well, con.  They look a little bit bling for my taste.  Too much fake chrome for my liking and the flashy light during operation reminds me of the kind of thing sold at a convenience store.  However, I can't see them while I am using them and everyone who knows me already knows I am totally uncool, and anyone that doesn't know me can go forth and multiply if they are going to judge me on a pair of headphones.  Would rather a nice, plain matt black with a more discrete LED.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"Bought the product for a family member, the first one unfortunately the headphone jack broke.  Spoke with the seller and was able to resolve the issue as the item was under warranty.  The seller was helpful in providing a new pair to replace the previous broken pair.  Overall, they are good headphones, wearing them long time may be slightly uncomfortable for certain people as my family member noted.  However, overall the noise canceling functionality and being wireless is worth while if you don't want to spend a lot of money on other brands.",4,1,2017-5-29,1,3,0
"I've had these since July 2018, and today they broke while picking them up from my desk to put on. They've never traveled, they just live at work on my desk. I use them for about 20 hours/week, so constant light use. Disappointed they broke with such a light touch, they still look new!As far as the sound, they are good, not great. I rarely used noise-canceling, as I travel with much smaller earbuds. They are comfortable to wear for 3-4 hours/day, but as with all over-ear headphones, they start to hurt where they press my glasses against my head.",2,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"This pair of headphones replaces an earlier pair I purchased, the earlier one sounded good when it worked, but was difficult to connect and turn off. The Corwin E7 connects to my blue tooth in seconds after I turn on the on/off switch, sound  very good, good bass. I use them to listen to my I pod., my TV and DVD player.I had a big problem getting my old headphones to connect, and had to push and hold different buttons to get them to turn off. With these headphones, flip one switch and they're on, and when done listening flip the switch and they're off. Haven't tried the noise reduction as I only have used them at home.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0

"I like these headphones! They are great except for one thing... I can't take them back to the old school way of using headphones.  If the charge on the headphone runs out, I would like to be able to just plug in the Aux cord from my headphones to my cell phone and listen that way.  But you have to have always have to have a charge, even if you are planning on listening with the AUX cord and no bluetooth.  If I would have know that, I would have purchased different headphones.  I don't think they mislead me or anything, I just want to make people aware that you have to always have a charge, even if you thought that you could just plug in.",4,1,2020-8-20,1,2,0

I liked these for the BT range and for the noise cancelling. For $50 the Audio quality is good but there were times where I'd be jamming out to a song and digital distortions would occur or sound just cut out. Not enough to be annoying or unusable. Two stars for the product quality. Bought these in Sept and was always careful with them and one day pulled them out of my bag and they were broken where the swivel is located. Very sad day as I really enjoyed these. Maybe it was my mistake for thinking I could take them to and from everyday in my bag? I expected these to be able to handle small trips in a backpack...,2,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0
Update 3-24-19Made a 3 hour flight and used these in the plane.  Noise Cancelling was good; I used to call my wife from the plane before we left and phone call was clear on both ends.  I enjoyed the flight and the quality of these headphones.  You won't be disappointed!,5,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"These headphones are better than I expected - especially for the price. I love the way they look and the quality of the sound. I'm certainly no sound expert, but the sound seems very good go me.The one thing I don't like is that they have to be charged before I can use them, even if I use the cable attached to my headphone jack on my computer. I don't understand why that is necessary. I rarely use them without the audio cable.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"I bought these to use while I was doing yard work.  I had always used wired pairs because my old iPod didn't have blue tooth and I thought the wireless ones would be unreliable.  Well, my iPod finally died after a decade and I had to buy a new one so I gave the wireless headphones a try.  I was very much impressed.  The sound quality was decent, the noise cancelling worked really well and I wasn't ripping a cord out with the weed eater every five minutes.  It was also nice that I could jump off of my mower to pick up sticks leaving my iPod on the mower.  I easily went up to 15 feet away with no problem.

Let me begin by saying that my hearing isn't the best - I'm 68 and I tend to hear sounds as slightly muffled. I just received these Cowin E7 headphones today so these are very early impressions!The headphones paired up with my PC immediately and without any difficulty - much easier than my old headphones. It took me a little while to locate and function test the controls -  but once I found everything 8t was easy to operate the headphones.,4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"These are excellent headphones, especially considering the low price (including the $10 coupon offered with purchase). The frame is well built and sturdy and almost looks like it is metal. The earpieces pivot. The bass response is deep and the treble clear, even at high volume. The overall sound is very balanced and rivals or exceeds my wired Sony and Bose headphones.  They paired quickly and easily with my iPhone XR via Bluetooth, where I have my entire iTunes library available on the iCloud. The Bluetooth range is very good, even outside with the phone inside. They are comfortable and light, even with glasses on. The ear mounted controls (volume, track advance) work perfectly, but take a little practice to intuitively use them with the headphones on. The track advance or (back), only works when listening to an entire album or playlist. You are supposed to be able to answer calls via the headphones, but I haven't tried that and really don't see much use for that function. They come with a very nice, soft storage bag; a USB charging cable; and a long media jack for devices without Bluetooth. Overall, for the price, I don't see how you can do any better than these headphones.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"Good price for the quality of product. Active noise cancelling is modest, but for the price it's to be expected. Fits comfortably on my head, with ear covers probably blocking most exterior noises.edit 12/10/19: one of the ear phones has broken away from the headset.

I bought my E7 in June of 2018 and all was excellent for about 20 months. Then I noticed a reduction in the Bluetooth ranges of about 40% and this June one of the earphones became detached from the headband when I picked them up. The shaft that rotates pulled out and would not stay when pushed back in. I am the only one who uses it and I have always babied them since they are a little expensive. I emailed service about my problem to see if they could be fixed 3-4 weeks ago but have not received a response. I super glued it back in which held for a few days and it fell off again. Kind of a disappointment because they seemed to be mechanically sound. Not sure if I would buy another set. Trying superglue again.,4,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"These sound fine, but I’m really not a fan of the design. They feel cheap and stick way out from my head. Think Princess Leia. The controls on the earphones are also useless. Typically, if I want to use the buttons on the outside, I’m either trying to pause it, play, adjust the volume or answer a phone call that is interrupting. These buttons seem to do none of this. There’s an awkward triangle that does different things depending on which point you press. Somehow, I’m either skipping to a different podcast or resetting to the beginning. Again, sound quality is fine, but these are neither attractive nor intuitive.***Update***",3,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"These headphones are really great. I bought them to cancel out noise in my open office. There are always a lot of students and professors around so having something to block them out was a must. These were perfect for that. Additionally, my ears always get sore after a while with most headphones and earbuds but not with these. The comfort is beyond great. Their customer service team is always helpful and more that willing to resolve problems should they arise. I highly recommend these headphones.

"Updating this review because after submitting my original 1 star review due to the headphones breaking and rendering them useless 9 months into use, I was contacted almost immediately by Cowin customer service who sent out a new pair of replacement headphones with fast prime shipping! We really like these headphones and I think it’s great that Cowin stands by their product. Deducting one star for the issue, but overall very pleased!ORIGINAL REVIEW: I ordered these for my husband 10 months ago. He is a fairly regular user of the headphones though not a heavy user. For 9 months he expressed how much he liked the headphones- said the sound quality and range were excellent and that they were very comfortable. He much preferred them to a pair by insignia he previously had that would produce a static noise. A month ago they broke when he went to take them off in the usual way. The ear piece basically snapped apart from the headband. Now the headphones are useless. We did not buy insurance for the headphones because we expected the quality should be good enough to last at least 2 or 3 years without having to pay more for insurance. So I’m rating this a 1 because for the price I think these should last a lot longer than nine months.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

IF YOU HAVE GREAT EYES GIVE THIS PRODUCT A TRY.Update: Based on my above comment seller has contacted me to better understand my concern. After communicating with them they replaced headphones.

"Not sure what is the design problem, but like other reviewers have reported, my left earpiece (charging port side) has broken (after 9 months ownership). I was wearing it when I heard a crack. Took it off and later that evening discovered that side very loose and unable to hold its position against my ear. Duct taped it up to hold it as best as possible (and did up the other side before that gives way too). Still functional but disappointing - should at least be able to make a year, if not two (three or four), before coming apart like that.",2,1,2020-8-15,1,1,0
"The product was a little more wobbly then expected. I didn't particularly like how lightweight it was and the weak clamp it has to keep on your head. I may have gotten a bad lemon. The noise canceling is amazing though, its my first time with noise canceling and the difference is amazing.I did get great customer service too from the seller when i had a complaint about the wobbliness and they managed to resolve the issue for me. I honestly was going to just live with it so i didn't really expect a follow up for such a minor complaint.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"Bought this to use on my lawn mower, it reduces noise some and bluetooth works fine but i get occasional digital distortions that are very loud and annoying. Same thing happens when using indoors at my house. This did not happen however on a plane trip to San Diego, no distortions there or back so not sure what is causing them?Update: I originally rated at three stars due to distortion issues but I was using an old and underpowered android phone which was most likely the issue. I have since upgraded to a Samsung S7 and have had no distortion issues since. Been using them in the shop while working with power tools and of course they don't get rid of all the sound but they do an very decent job and I can listen to streaming services while I am working.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"I'm hoping that I just got a defective pair. There is no difference in the background noises whether I have the noise canceling feature turned on or not. I still hear my husband snore (and he's not that bad), I still hear the aquarium running and the neighbors dog barking. There is a little bit of a hiss with the headset on my head and the bluetooth feature turned on with nothing playing. The hiss goes away when I turn on the noise canceling. The sound (music, etc.) coming through the BT is acceptable but not great. I'm returning and reordering so I will keep you posted.",2,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0
"I purchased these headphones because they were significantly less expensive than the Bose wireless noise cancelling headphones that I was looking at, but quite frankly could not afford.  I was very happy with the sound quality of the Cowin E7 headphones, but after a time had some charging issues.  The company reached out to me and offered to ”make it right”.  if they make good on that offer, the headphones really do earn the 4 stars that the sound quality of the headphones coupled with the price truly deserves.",4,1,2019-9-19,1,1,0
"These headphones were purchased to use for online teaching. The product arrived in a a nice box and presentation. Upin unpackaging the bluetooth setting ws very easy to connect. One thing to mention, make sure you charge your headphones before you attempt to use them, once the battery is low the headphones will lose the microphone feature first to indicate low battery. It also has an indicator to assist.  The headphones are very comfortable on the ear. After multiple web classes the headphones were good for noise cancellation, easy to hear others, and the microphone was clear for the listener to understand me clearly.  At this time, I do not have any negative features.  Good product, recommend to others.",4,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
"It is a shame that these headphones had enough metal parts and screws to be reliable and dependable, yet the axle on which the cups rotate are made of plastic, and the connection of the cups to the headband is flimsy. Too bad, these could be the keepers.EDIT December 2019: after I published my review, the seller sent me another pair of the same model. I am trying to be more gentle with the new pair, knowing their weak spot. I do not fold them frequently anymore. The first pair lasted almost one year, I am thankful that the seller sent me a replacement pair. I am adding another star for the great after-sales support.",3,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0
Although I gave a bad review previously I am updating the review as of 2/7/2020. Cowin responded to my emails explaining that they did reply on 1/14/2020. The email from Cowin could have gone into my junk email box and I did not notice. Cowin apologized for the delay and send a code for a replacement set of headphones at no charge to me. Cowin provides a great warranty service and goes way beyond what I expected.  I cannot speak highly enough of Cowin as they stand behind their products fully. As far as the headphones themselves they are very high quality with great sound and sound deadening quality. A great value for the price. Cowin will be my top choice for quality headphones in the future.,5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
I love these things.. The battery lasts a long time. Very clear sound with the NC turned on. They connect SUPER fast to my bluetooth and have a very good range.My only 'issues' if you could call them that are the shiny surfaces. Matte finishes seem to be a much better idea because these get fingerprints and smudges on them easily and it kills my OCD. HAHA :D,4,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
"I got these about 2 weeks ago now.  They are super comfortable and the bass blows away any of the earbuds I've tried before.  I can't give an accurate rating for high end becsuse my hearing is bad in that area.  Noise cancelling is great.  I love that you can just have noise cancelling and not have to have music playing.  Charging lasts a long time.  I cant find anything to complain about!- Just an update.  Ive had these now for a couple of months and I really dont need to change anything from my origil review.  They still look good, i love the bass, and you can wear them for hours... especially since fit around your ears and not on them. The noise cancelling is pretty good, but ive read that the pro version has gotten even better.  I tried them against some higher end Sony headphones and I have to say that i like these more.",5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"Pros: Does a good job of cancelling noise and is relatively cheap. The sound is good for casual use.Cons: So, there are others that have mentioned that the minimum volume is too loud. This is true if you are connected via blue tooth, the minimum volume is rather loud. If you connect with the cable it's much better.",2,1,2017-12-17,1,3,0
"I purchased these headphones to replace an aging pair of different brand, and these certainly blow them out of the water!  The noise cancellation feature is incredible, and sound quality is up there, too.  By far the easiest pairing process I've had, just putting the back of my phone against the earpiece and they were connected in a snap!  Microphone quality is decent as well, or so I have been told.My only complaint is that the play/pause button doesn't also work as a Google Assistant trigger, but instead redials when it is held down.  In fact, it's a little too easy to redial with just two taps on the play/pause.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,1
"First off, customer service deserves 5 ⭐ just for the effort they took to try and make everything good with me.The SE7 headphones are a great set of headphones. The sound is very clear and has a great depth of tones with bass. The Bluetooth is very quick and easy to use, it pairs very quickly when turned on. I was able to get over 40ft away from my phone and still have good signal. I love the headphone design and carrying case. I just throw these in my luggage when traveling and don't worry about them being damaged.  The noise cancelling really works well. I have a train that comes by frequently and I would turn on the nose cancelling to block the train horn. I never used the 3.5 jack to plug into my phone since my phone does not have a headphone jack connection.",3,1,2018-7-24,1,0,0
"I have bought high-end brands in the past but I needed something just to use for online conference calls during shelter-at-home so I thought for the price it's ok if they are not everything I need.  Boy was I mistaken.  These headphones can go head-to-head with my $300 wireless ones I use at my office.  They don't cancel out surrounding sounds as much as I would have liked, but the sound quality is amazing and they were super easy to connect through bluetooth.  Definitely recommend this product!",5,1,2020-4-17,1,1,0
"For the price, these headphones are great. After going through several cheap (<$25) headphones and never being able to hear movies on my kindle during flights, I decided to get a noise canceling pair.  While this pair doesn't completely cut background noise out, it dramatically reduces it on flights. Even when I wasn't watching a movie, I wore them when a baby was having a justified meltdown on the plane from Seattle to London Heathrow.  I could still hear the baby, and at first was thinking they weren't doing anything, until I took them off... holy cow, they went back on fast!  Also notable was how the charge lasted for my entire 9.5 hour flight, and the 2 hour drive to my final destination because I forgot to turn them off.  If like me you don't use headphones enough to buy a super fancy pair, these are a good back up.  My only complaint, which is minor, is the storage bag. You cannot close the bag with the drawstring because the headphones are too big for it... not sure why they couldn't add an extra inch of pleather and make it functional.  My husband has used these on his commute a couple of times and has requested a pair for our flight to england at Christmas, so all things considered, these are a good buy.",5,1,2018-10-18,1,0,0
"Some pretty good headphones. Stylish and not as heavy as I thought they were going to be. The sound is crisp and immersive and overall enjoyable. Comfy fit although not for long. I've had cheaper headphones that fit more comfortably on my head but don't sound nearly as good, so if you like good sound over long-time comfort, these are for you.Little nitpicks:",4,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I loved these headphones. They are super soft and fully cover my ears (which was a big thing due to piercings).  The sound was good and the active noise cancelling was fine. However, my headphones broke already :( The area that swivels completely sheared off and it's not wearable any more. My last pair of headphones lasted me 4 years - I take pretty good care of them. The window for returns was 1 month and the window for service and fixes was 2 :(  I will be buying another pair that will hopefully last quite  bit longer.***Update - I had customer service get a hold of me tonreplace my broken ones. They were super easy to work with and replaced my broken ones with the newer version. I’ve only had the replacement ones for less than a month - so if these last longer (preferable a couple years!) I will upgrade my rating to a 5. They are still super soft and comfortable. I love that they completely cover my ears - I have piercings that make the on ears headphones painful to wear! They are super easy to setup with Bluetooth. They’re very portable, and the newer version came with a travel case that helps protect it.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,1
"I bought these for noise cancellation.  They work for music, but not for noise canceling.  They are very loud for music.  Phone must be at volume 3 for them to even start working.  It’s the lowest level they will play at.  It’s loud enough for me.  When one has the volume all the way up, others can hear it who are around you.Edit: after reading my review the company reached out to me directly to fix the fact that I was disappointed with the quality of the noise canceling aspect of the headphones.  They offered to rectify this in any way. I only paid around $50 for the headphones and as stated above, they are great for music.  They will work fine for me.  I recently traveled in an airplane with them and they worked well for that as well.  But the customer service at this company just cannot be beat.  I highly recommend these headphones for the quality of music, price, and customer service.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"These wireless headphones with a built-in mic are perfect for virtual online meetings.  The volume controls are easy to use and they set up with my PC easily.  I never have problems hearing others (unless they are having a bad connection), or being heard on the mic.  My ears are very sensitive but these are comfortable with nice over the ear cushioning.  Wouldn't wear them constantly without removing periodically, but for one hour meetings throughout the day, they do not overheat ears.  I like them for listening to podcasts and musics occasionally.  The noise cancelling is sufficient for me although they would probably not cancel out airplane noise--but, who's flying anymore?!  Overall, a great product and well worth the price.",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"These were good headphones all around. I bought them about 6 months ago and have enjoyed using them just about every day for work in the office. I especially liked the purple color of the ones I bought.However, just yesterday the swivel hinge on one of the ear cups broke, causing the ear cup to spin freely instead of stopping at 90 degrees. The plastic mechanism that makes the ear cups swivel to 90 degrees is a bit flimsy and will likely break before you've had these for a year. I expect I will still be able to use the headphones if I duct-tape that ear cup in place so it doesn't swivel at all, but that's not ideal.",3,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0

"Warning: Do not wear these while driving.  I did and then I parked my car and left it running for 3 hours while I was at a coffee shop!  I had no idea I left my car on because the headphones worked so well.  The music quality is excellent in this headphones hearing a fullness that music should be heard at.  The headphones are great for concentration as well.  I will often play some white noise in my headphones to concentrate especially working from home.  Overall, I am very glad I purchased them and look forward to using them much more.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"Ok OK OK, wow and wow again. So I didn't know what to expect as I can no longer use earphones due to wax build up in the ears so Im going back to headphones which has been a while, like 5 years a while. I've had to have my ears drained every 6 months since then. I've had bose, and recently purchased Taotronics noise canceling and the Bluetooth pair which are awesome by the way. I gave them to my wife and as of 7-24-17 received the cowin noise canceling headphones and I have to say they are better built then bose and sound just as good. If you want to get the full experience of these play ""No ordinary love"" by Sade at 1/2 to 3/4 of the way turned up and you will see that these are the best you can get. You get bass, highs, lows and vocals at a perfect level. All that with NC off as you lose some of the range but you don't need it as it already has it as soon as you put them on your ear. Not just for the price, but any price. I was a bose man until they got a short in the cord in 3 months and way over priced. I give my seal of approval on these and will have to buy another pair. Great job Cowin.",5,1,2017-7-24,1,1,0
"I listen to music of all kinds (Classical, Electronic, Rock, etc) and wear these headphones all hours of the day.Comfort: They are comfortable to wear for several hours (3-4 hours before I remove mine for a break). The around the ear cup is just a little bit small for me so my outer lobes are still pressed against my head, but the cushion and leather are comfortable that it doesn't hurt at all. My ears just get a little sweaty from being pressed but I can arrange the cup to not press my earlobes. I don't have large ears (I'm more average male ear).",4,1,2018-2-23,1,0,0
"I had been looking for noise canceling headphones for a long overseas flight, but didn’t want to break the bank. Corwin headphones seemed to fall in the range I was comfortable with. The sound is good, but the noise canceling was not quite as though as I had hoped. They did dampen about 3/4 of the engine noise going over, but I had upgraded my seat. Coming home, I don’t think they covered more than about 1/2, just enough to keep it to a dull roar. I also did not expect them to be so glossy and shiny. They are difficult to hold onto when trying to adjust to the right size, and slide around on your head, especially if you have your hair pulled back.  Overall, I am pretty happy with them, but not sure if I would buy this model again, or look at a different pair.",4,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"I've been using these headphones several hours a week and have enjoyed them so much I recommended them to my coworkers. My problem with my current headphones (Beats) is how hard the ear pads are and how hard they press against my ears. The protein pads on these Cowin headphones are so soft and don't apply much pressure to the ears - my ears are still fine after several hours of listening to music. They're pretty good at canceling out noise too - I can hardly a thing when I have sound playing on these headphones.As much as I love these headphones, the left pad stopped working recently, and this order is now out of the return window. For the price and length of time that the headphones were fully functional, I wouldn't recommend buying this.",1,1,2019-9-9,1,2,0
"Update: after contacting Cowin through email, they promptly sent an Amazon code for a replacement headphone set. The new headphones work wonderfully and were received with 2 days of ordering. The head phones sound wonderful & are very lightweight & comfortable to wear. If you do order these from Amazon, make sure you order from Cowin and not from a 3rd party so you have access to their great customer care in case you need it.This was a gift. Brand new out of the box the battery would not hold a charge. The headset worked for all of 5 minutes. I ordered this early and the return window was only 30 days, so these were a $50 piece of trash. It’s really sad because they are comfortable on your head and sounded great for the 5 minutes that they actually worked.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
"I purchased the Cowin e7 headphones to use mainly for work Zoom calls and to occasionally watch streaming shows.I am extremely happy with how well they fit/feel over my head/ears, they practically feel weightless on my head. The sound is great quality on zoom, but I’d personally love a little more bass for music/movies.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,1
"At this price point I have to admit that I was not expecting too much.  A bit more than Chinese garbage sold at flea markets but I wasn't expecting to be amazed at all.  Received the product, charged it up and put it to use.  Noise cancelling at this price point is excellent and on par with other headphones hundreds of dollars more.  BT range is also within specifications.  I was at 32 feet for several minutes on the porch and there were no drops or issues with quality.I'm thoroughly surprised at what I received.  Far exceeded my expectations.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0
They are definitely noise canceling.  I can't even hear my phone ring sitting right next to it.  My only complaint is the weight of the headphones.  They also tend to press your ears against your head pretty hard causing some discomfort if they are worn too long.  I have had some issues with static when I first connect them to the TV.  I found that turning them off and on again to reconnect solves the problem.  Overall  a nice set of headphones.,4,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"These are $70 noise cancelling headphones, I'm sure Bose or the more expensive headphones are better at noise cancelling, but you get what you pay for. That being said, I loved these head phones. I had 18 hours worth of flights and I knew I needed something that would be comfortable and block some of the noise. I did a lot of research and these were recommended to me, and for that I am thankful. They were super comfortable to wear. I am a TERRIBLE sleeper on airplanes, so I end up moving a lot trying to get comfortable, these stayed in place the whole time. The noise cancelling function was better than I expected, but still not 100% perfect. But again $70 vs  $300. I could definitely tell a major difference when I turned it on. I didn't have any problems listening to music or the in-flight movie with the noise cancelling function on. I know other complained about that, I did listen to a podcast but not an audible book- I didn't find problems with any of the sound.They were so comfortable that I didn't mind wearing them around the airport. This was big for me as I hate having things covering my ears, it was a pleasant surprise.",5,1,2017-12-12,1,0,0
"Updated Review 8/8/2020:I have been using them almost every night for 1 1/2 years now.  I am a night owl and use them for private listening of music & TV.  The're great and have held up, including the battery (plays 20 hrs.).  As with any noise reduction product, some sounds cancel well, others not so well  When my central A.C. comes on, even if I have them on with nothing playing, I can barely hear the A.C., big difference!  Honest!",5,1,2019-3-11,1,0,0
"These are awesome! I ordered the white headphones, they are attractive, they fit my small head without wobble or slipping off, often a problem for us smaller people (I'm 5'2), easy to use, and the sound quality is very good! Noise cancelling aspect also seems to be very good, but the real test will be in the airplane. The customer service is excellent--I needed help in connecting these to my PC via bluetooth (my PC was not recognizing the headphones), so I went to the Cowin website, and was immediately connected to a service agent via chat. This person walked me through the steps to getting this all set up. The price of the headphones is also amazing, I'm very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend!So I'd like to add this to my previous review. Somehow, I broke one of the headphones and contacted Cowin to take advantage of the no-hassle return. They very quickly sent me a new pair, without a cost to me. Excellent customer service! Highly recommend.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"I have had the headphones for about a week now and i am really enjoying it. Its very comfortable, isn't tight on my head, the pad around the ear is soft and it does block out a lot of the sound. The sound quality is pretty great.My favorite part is how long the battery life last, days most times and is easily pairs to many bluetooth enabled devices. Answering calls is very easy and the sound is clear on that as well and i have not had any issues with the person on the other end hearing me.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"My husband purchased this for himself in red and he loves using them for working at home (they cancel the noise of our 4 boys admirably). We purchased the green ones for myself and Zoom meetings, language lessons, etc, however the last Zoom meeting I attended, the group informed me that they couldn't hear me well and I had to just speak through my computer monitor. I will try again, but I am disappointed.They work really well as noice cancellation devices, however! They don't even have to be streaming any audio, they just need to cover the ears.",3,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0
"Absolutely unbelievable for the money. They need to dump the overly bright blue light as I find it annoying. Other than that they are great. The sound is impeccable with rolling bass and crystal clear highs. The battery lasts quite a while too. They are quite comfortable although a bit bulky, slightly heavy and not overly stylish. When I do squats at the gym on a squat machine they get in the way a bit but no big deal.  The noise cancelling ability cuts out some of the music's bass notes but that is to be expected. Just don't play music when the noise cancelling ability is on. At that point you don't need it anyway! I subsequently bought the Beats Solo 3 but returned them as they sounded tinney and have less control over the music and are way overpriced but good build quality. Try these instead and I bet you will like them too!",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"I needed a comfortable pair of headphones for the office, and these certainly do the trick.Pros: Active noise cancelling to tone down office chatter? Amazing! Bluetooth? Excellent! Build quality is excellent.  Construction is mostly plastic, but they added a nice springy piece of stainless to strengthen the band.  Also, the plastic feels solid and does not creak. Design looks nice. Battery has lasted several full days at work without needing a charge, which is exactly the sort of thing I have come to expect from the OEM behind Cowin.",5,1,2017-8-15,1,1,0
"Generally my reviews are short and occasionally one word (Usually Movies/Shows). If you prefer something succinct scroll to the bottom.I originally purchased these headphones in 2017. I was less than impressed, a one star review. I went out on bought a refurbished JBL Elite 700 headphones $100 ( new was over $300 at the time). No way I'm spending over $100 for headphones, and even that's pushing it. They sounded great, and the noise canceling superb.",4,1,2017-10-2,1,0,0
"I read many of the reviews and saw that they have such a high number and high score, so I pulled the trigger. I got the head phones two days later and tried them out. The sound quality wasn't the greatest. The noise cancelling didn't really cancel much at all. You could tell that it was on but they diminish the volume as well. I have better noise cancelling headphones from Sennheiser so I know how they should work. These failed big time. Plus to add icing on the cake, the signal would cut out while using them every now and then for the short time I did use them. Back they went.",1,1,2019-6-11,1,2,0
"Didn't give five star just for various little issues.  It really is a great pair of headphones.  Sounds great.  Noise cancellation works really well.  Good bass.My complaints are minor.  The on off switch is fiddly.  I don't like it's location, or function, as it has two different modes, and the one most will use (bluetooth) is in the MIDDLE of a very tiny three way switch.  I'm always switching it past what I want, and having to correct.  I don't like that.",4,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0

"Excellent value. Awesome sound. Plenty of volume. Plenty of bass. Microphone good not excellent but no problems. They look and fit fantastic. I would compare them with much more expensive headphones. Bluetooth range acceptable. Be realistic they won't go a mile. Regulate your expectations and you will not have a problem at all with Bluetooth range. I love these headphones. Look good and good quality. It's a tad bit more than that cheap and fairly good ones 50 extra 10 or $20 is so very very worth it! Because it feels like you spent an extra one or $200 to get this quality. They are loud enough. I don't need to go searching for a volume app, and Equalization app, or bass volume increasong app. Within reasonable expectations these are fantastic headphones for the money. Great value. I wet myself with glee. 😳🤣❤",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0

GET THESE!",5,1,2019-8-7,1,2,0
"Great headphones, good bass, passable mids and highs, possible due to the noise cancelling; which is good, but if you have an open office and loud colleagues, it isn't gonna help as much as you think and you're better off with in-ear headphones if you want total noise isolation. Having said that, these do a good job, and generally I find that there are few situations where the excess noise isn't drowned out. If you're colleagues are so obnoxious that you can hear them through the music, a conversation is warranted over solving the problem by technology proxy.For phone calls, I've found that the audio is garbled and terrible when using bluetooth; this is possibly just how bluetooth phone calls work? Not sure. Using the included audio cable and turning off the bluetooth allows using the headphones to be used for a call without encountering this issue, but when a call comes in and you're already listening via bluetooth, it's kinda too late for that. Best option if a call comes in while you're listening via bluetooth is to turn off the headphones and answer with the handset. Not sure if every phone has this issue, but I tested on a sony xperia and a note 4 and I wouldn't think I'd see the exact same problem across such diverse hardware.",5,1,2017-9-8,1,0,0
"Pro - Good sound, long play time, comfortable, better than my Mac speakers for sure. They don't cancel all the sound which is good because that means if it isn't too loud I can hear the phone next to me, or the wife. 4-5 hours to charge is fine because they run for so long.Con - Range in the house about 20-25 feet, see below for a solution to that.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"I'm not an expert on high-quality headphones and most my life have just used earbuds but these headphones have changed my mind forever.  I tried out some noise-cancelling headphones at a store and thought they were really cool, so I decided to 'splurge' and get a pair for myself.  BEST IDEA I'VE EVER HAD.  The noise cancelling is not 100% (I can still hear loud noises or people talking outside) but not if I have music playing.  And the sound is so clean I've actually brought these around to people I know and 'forced' them to try them out.  After less than a week of having these I bought a pair for my dad too.  For the price I don't think I could have asked for more.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I think the most important thing for me to state before getting into this review is the set of headphones I came from: Master & Dynamic MW50 - about a $300 set..so when it comes to the sound quality aspect, I've been spoiled. Take it with a grain. TL;DR pros cons style review at the bottom. Ramble-fest just below:I didn't expect these to really hold a candle to more expensive offerings, but still wanted to be surprised if that makes sense. To put it frankly: you should never try to boast about these sounding good.",4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
I'm new to using headphones and earbuds and wasn't sure if I wanted to spend hundreds for the one's that are supposed to be the best so I went with these since they got tons of great reviews.  I am more than satisfied with what I got.  The sound is really nice and the noise cancellation is good.  It's so good I didn't even know my dog was barking while I was listening to music.  I got a bark alert which interrupted the music (I have a  dog camera that gives those type of notifications).  I loved these so much that I decided to get earbuds from COWIN as well.  So far so good with those as well.  I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone and actually have.  Totally satisfied customer here.,5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I bought this primarily for noise cancellation, and it seems to do a pretty good job with that.  Very comfortable, although I'm concerned about the life of these.  So soft, dainty, easily moving, shiny, etc.  BUT...The big issue is the severe lack of mids and highs.  It's dramatic.  Mids are where most of your music happens, vocals guitars etc.  And highs are what gives it life.  I've never had headphones that are lacking here, it's always the bass, which is actually fine in these.",3,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"My workmates listen to hot, steaming garbage that has been auralized and weaponized for decades; AKA pop music.  The two stations 'vary' between 'yesterday's favorites' and 'today's greatest latest (s)hits.'  The rotation is slower then ice melt at the poles.  They have worked there for years and I wonder if they've ever noticed any format changes.  IE 'Today's greatest' has only 40  songs then 20 years later ""Now playing yesterday's favorites!""Battery life is great.  I charge them every three days.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"I just got mine last week. They have big shoes to fill - my last pair of JVCs survived 8 years. After roughly 15 hrs of use on airplanes in BT/NC mode, I can say they canceled out probably 60%+ of the engine noise. If you wear them to cancel out a fan/air handler or a hotel's window A/C, they block at least 90%. I was astonished ... I could barely hear the 24"" fan in a tile hallway and actually slept in them on Monday to block out the buzzing, droning wall A/C.So - why 4 stars and not 5? I have a beach ball for a head. That's not Cowin's fault, but it means they need to allow just a little more expansion in their headband to make it comfortable for longer wear (6+ hrs).",4,1,2017-8-6,1,1,0
"These head phone worked pretty well until the 3rd month when it broke.  One of the ear pods broke off the rest of the head set.  I tried to fix it with no avail.  Don't buy the head set.  Horrible, Horrible, Horrible … Also the charge really didn't keep as long as is was told.  Don't buy people, Don't buy.Update.  I got a call from customer service and they offered me a replacement set, an upgraded set.  So far these are working and it has been doing what's expected.  I'm giving these a try and see how long these last, so in the meantime I have changed the score to a 3.  I've read a lot of reviews of people who have given these a rating of one star and I keep reading my problems in theirs with the old set so there isn't much confidence here.  So well see.",3,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0

"I don't normally write reviews cause I don't feel the need to, however I'm a headphone fanatic and have bought several over the years. I have primarily bought Skullcandy since I was in high school and the number one reservation I always had about that brand was their lack of comfortable headphones. I can honestly say that these Cowin's are the most comfortable headphones I've purchased. I was unsure about purchasing them because I had my eyes set on a pair of Sony headphones for quite a while but I wasn't willing to pay $100 or more so I took a chance on something new.The sound quality is balanced. The bass isn't overwhelming. The noise cancellation is a surprising bonus as I wasn't thinking I would care about it but it really does add to the experience in certain places.",5,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0
"I'm furious.  I have $12 bluetooth headphones that don't have a problem when playing videos but would never believe a $60 set couldn't handle it.  These are total crap.  If you watch a video with the audio streaming through these, there is about a half-second delay between the audio and video so it's like watching a dubbed foreign movie.  Absolutely awful and completely inexcusable.  And how the heck did these get so many 4-star reviews?!?!  They're UNUSABLE for watching movies or TV but even for audio, they're really not that good.  They certainly aren't very loud and the bass is very heavy and 'muddy'.  Oddly, turning on the Noise Cancellation makes them sound better but why should I have to do that?  If you're only gonna listen to music, AND you want to spend twice as much as another headset which would be louder and sound better, go ahead and buy this piece of garbage.  But if you're ever gonna watch video, you're screwed.  I am flabbergasted that this piece of crap ever made it out of the engineering department.",1,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"These headphones performed well and other than with Skype, connected easily via Bluetooth with my other devices.  Unfortunately, the earcups are too large for my ears so the padding doesn't fit evenly either against my ears or against my skull.  As a result, my lower ears would ache after using them for a short while.  Also, they are really pretty heavy.  At first the weight isn't that noticeable but after a while, it is a relief to take them off.  I am hard of hearing and was disappointed in the volume range.",3,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0
"I bought theses headphones to replace a pair made entirely of plastic that broke at the yoke that holds the ear piece, not one, but three times. The ear muffs fit comfortably and block out most of the surrounding noise. I do not rely on the noise cancelling feature so I will not comment on it. The ear muffs do not squeeze my head and I can wear them for a couple of hours before removing them. The headphone rests more on the top of my head. The sound quality is very good in my opinion, but I am not an aficionado. Pairing was easy and they have never failed to connect to my PC or phone. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a full size headphone.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"Initially bought these because they were a middle of the road price Bluetooth noise cancelling headphone. Bought two pairs- one for me and one for my wife. Overall, connectivity to phone was great, and sound was pretty good. Found the controls for volume and track changing a bit odd (almost felt backwards). The microphone for making calls was useless on both though. For what was needed it fit the fill though. Unfortunately, after about 6 months both pairs have broken in the same manner. The pivot connection for the earphone has snapped causing both of them to have one side dangle, and the headphones then can't sit correctly on the head. One set slipped off my head and landed on hardwood and that caused the break. The other, unknown how, but broke in the same manner. For the price point, expected them to be a little more sturdy. Like I said, sound and noise cancelling was pretty good though. Would consider buying again if they were a lower price. But a little too fragile for the cost I think.",2,1,2019-3-11,1,1,0
"Long time Bose headphone user here (7 years?).  Started looking at alternatives once my old faithfuls started going out on me.  My first instinct was to buy another super expensive pair, but decided to give this one a shot.  Other reviewers are right about the lack of noise canceling - it is not on par with Bose (not that you would expect it to be at this price).It's nice to have the option to use either Bluetooth or cable.  Just note that if you need to switch from BT to cable, you have to turn off BT on your phone.  I have no idea where the music was going when I made the switch - it was still playing but not out of the headphones or phone itself.",4,1,2017-12-1,1,1,0
"My apartment building is undergoing concrete restoration, and working from home during the pandemic makes for a miserable day at the office. I bought this item because of the thousands of great reviews, and the price was reasonable.  I didn't hold out much hope that this would make a real difference, especially when the workers are jack hammering and sandblasting at the same time.  I was very surprised that the noise cancelling function muted the racket to such a degree that I'm not bothered at all; I am able to ignore the significantly muted sounds of heavy construction.  I only wish I could get something for my dog who spends the work day under the bed. I recommend this product.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"I needed noise cancelling for my gym workouts. Although the noise cancelling here is not a perfect cone of silence, at this price point it is effective enough to cancel out most of the background noise I am trying to eliminate. These also don't cost the same $350 that Sony and Bose charge for their noise cancelling headsets.  The sound quality for music and audio books is also quite good.I sleep with a very loud white noise machine. On occasion I listen to audio books with this headset on while two feet away from my sleep machine (it's on because my spouse is already asleep.) These effectively block out almost all of the white noise and I am able to clearly hear my book. They are also very comfortable.",5,1,2019-3-11,1,0,0
"On the plus side, these are reasonably comfortable headphones that, when noise cancelling is active, produce decent sound.  That is, until you move.  The slightest abrupt movement (think a vehicle hitting a bump in the road, or a quick movement of the head) will cause a popping sound in each ear.  It's not particularly loud, but definitely noticeable.  It doesn't happen with noise cancelling off, but then the sound quality is pretty flat.  I use mine while traveling by air.  Noise cancellation itself is fair, decreasing but not eliminating the typical background noise in the aircraft cabin.  I listen mostly to podcasts so I can't comment on how well these perform with various music genres.Bottom line is they're okay, but I wish I'd spent a little more for better quality sound.",3,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
Ok this is my first headphones and wow when I opened the box which came delivered with no damages they look great very nicely packaged well protected the headphones themselves are well put together fairly light which I don't have any complaints read the instructions before using them they do recommend to charge the headphones for a full charge first before use after that I connected to my iPhones wifi very quickly I put them on adjusted the volume which works with the volume level from your phone too so if you want louder volume you might try a different way to listen to music that can change the volume level and for bass l like a little more bass out of the headphones but as I listened to different types of music the headphones seem to compensate you don't get heavy bass bottom but enough to keep you foot stomping plus you don't want your eardrums to ring afterwards also the noise reducing capability is awesome background noise drops tremendously all in all I'm happy with them the construction of the headphones are very well done great product would recommend them they are light weight easy to use comfortable and when your done using them they have a carry bag so you can store them till next use plus your charging cords thanks for greater music listening 👍and sorry for any misspelled words if any.,5,1,2017-8-1,1,0,0
"What can I say? I L-O-V-E these headphones. After reading some of the reviews on here and checking other reviews online, I decided to try these and see if they are as good as everyone says. Well, they're even BETTER!!! The sound quality in these is excellent, at least for the casual, everyday user. I'm sure some audiophiles might take issue with them, but for the average person, which most of us probably are, you really cannot go wrong buying these headphones. I was amazed at the clarity of the sound quality. Haven't really been able to check the noise cancelling aspect, but it seems to be adequate the little I've tried, but really, in a normal environment, you probably won't even need it. I was a little worried when I first put these on as the padding on the ear pieces seemed a little on the smallish side, but the padding is very comfortable and I've worn these for hours watching videos and had no discomfort at all.The battery life is fantastic too. I can use these what's probably an average amount of time (1-2 hours daily) and still only need to charge them maybe once or twice a week.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"These headphones are exactly what you would expect for $70.  They sound way better than a $30-40 pair.  As a matter of fact they sound almost exactly like my Sony MDR-7506 which are considered quality headphones.  Pairing was no problem and the battery life is really good, although I wouldn't say it's anywhere near 30 hours.  They're comfortable enough to wear for long period of time, which is one of the most important things to me since I had bought a pair of bluetooth headphones before that I couldn't wear for even 10 minutes without them killing my dome, but the comfort level isn't like a high end pair of cans.  My biggest gripes are probably the controls on the headphones.  They work, but volume down/previous track is on the top and volume up/next track is on the bottom which isn't what you would naturally expect.  Plus when you want to increase or decrease the volume you have to hold the button down, so it's not as precise as having increments.  I haven't really tried the noise cancelling in an environment where a lot of people are talking, but it does drown out the TV and other background noises.  All together they're well worth the money if you don't want a dirt cheap pair that are crap and don't have the money to spend on a super high end brand.",5,1,2018-3-14,1,0,0
"Overall garbage. I bought these as a student who has now been thrown into a remote environment with far too many distractions at home to be able to focus without some sort of noise canceling device.Initially, they worked well. It’s only now after a month of use that their sound had decided to crap out on me making a horribly warped static noise in place of lecture audio. I can no longer use them.",1,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0
"Update: order with confidence as if there are any issues, their staff will help you and make it right . Great customer service easily bringing this rating to five stars. Well deserved. They are very quick to respond and fix problems! Kudos to their team!I purchased these on a sale for a flat $50 with shipping which is a great price - down from it's normal $74.00. The sheer number of reviews, in excess of 7,000, and a decent average score satisfied any qualms I may have and for $50 I decided to take the plunge and give them a try. I am primarily interested in high-quality, high-fidelity headphones that will cancel out much of the noise around me and engulf me in electronic music while I work on projects on my laptop such as programming, design, systems administration, and other things that require focus. I have owned high-end Bose, Sony, and Monster over-the-ear active noise-cancellation headphones in the past and am familiar with high quality headphones.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0

"These earphones do exactly what I wanted them to do.  Let me enjoy streaming tv on my cell phone while listening to the show via bluetooth while soaking in the hot tub.  The sound quality is fabulous at the volume level I listen which isn't too high because I don't want to lose my hearing.  Therefore, I have no idea how they sound full blast, but they sound great up to about mid-level.  I suspect they probably sound pretty good even at higher levels.  Overall I think these headphone are a great value and I will most likely order a second pair for my wife soon.  I have no doubt she will soon discover how great it is to soak in the hot tub watching her favorite tv show at which point we'll have to fight over using the only pair of bluetooth headphones we currently own.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0

So I drive a Tonka truck. you know the big giant truck that’s the size of a house. These trucks are very loud there’s a lot of loud noise around me and these headphones work really well By illuminating a large portion of the noise. Once in a while they do kind of wig out. But for the price you’re paying the sound quality is really good it’s got decent bass to it a lot better than the Bose headphones overall this has been one of the best purchases I’ve had made. The battery life is really good on these even with the noise canceling which I work a 12 hour shift and they last the whole shift.,5,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0
"Got this headset as I needed it for both, listening to music, and to make calls from time to time. Originally, they were going to be my work headset to make calls and just not have to be switching between headsets. Noise cancelling is great, and music sounds amazing. However, when you get into a call (I use Microsoft Teams, mostly) it is a whole different thing.I noticed on both of my computers that it seems to have 2 modes: ""Stereo"" and ""Hands-free AG Audio"". My issue is with the latter. As soon as you switch, sound quality goes to hell. When you get into a call, or a voice chat, it is chaos. People can't hear you, they hear absolutely everything that is happening around you, though. So it simply is an awful experience.",4,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"After 10 months of ownership and use, I can testify that these headphones performed as described: they are comfortable, the sound quality is quite high, the noise cancellation is quite good, the battery is long-lived, and the bluetooth connectivity is outstanding.  For the purchase price ($65 in late 2017), they were the best audio investment that I've made.Furthermore, Cowin stands by their warranty with minimal fuss. After 10 months of regular use, a plastic connector between the headband and the ear cup broke -- it is one of the few moving parts and is the most likely place for breakage. Cowin support answered my e-mail within 12 hours on a weekend, verified my purchase, warranty, & breakage of the product within 1 more e-mail exchange, and issued a 99% discount code for replacement via Amazon.  Within 6 days of initial contact, new headphones were in my possession.  No muss, no fuss.  The easiest resolution of a warranty dispute that I have experienced in online shopping.",5,1,2018-11-4,1,1,0
"I rate the product 4.5 stars out of 5. Starting with the appearance, the headphones have a nice design and looks pretty cool. Only problem is that it is pretty easy to get fingerprints on the buttons themselves and those fingerprints allow dust and other stuff to stick to the headphones. Next, the sound quality. At first though, it was a big weird and the audio sounded different, but I'm going to assume that was because of the connection quality was bad at the time.  Now, the audio is perfect and I have no problems with it whatsoever. The noise canceling title of the headphones is a bit of a stretch to be honest. I think these headphones should have noise reducing in the title instead as it reduces the background noise a lot, but does not truly cancel them out. The battery life of the headphones is something I can not truly give feedback on. I only wear the headphones for an hour or two at a time and never reach the limit stated in the product description. I usually plug these headphones into the charger whenever I am not using them. The last subject, comfort, is one I consider the most important. If the product is not comfortable to wear, then everything else is pointless to me. These headphones are really comfortable. They cover my ear entirely unlike other headphones. Also, I wear glasses and that is usually one of the things that causes discomfort when I wear headphones, but I do not have to worry about that with these headphones. I just wish they would extend a tiny bit more to make it looser, because I have a bigger head than most people.In conclusion, these headphones are amazing, but a few improvements can make them even better.",5,1,2017-6-18,1,3,0

I am a busy creator who needs to be able to make somethin on logic, at the same time play my electric guitar, bass guitar and record with my microphone.  but to sum up the quality of these, Id say they are a bargain and worth the budget price for good quality! If you expect $400 worth of quality from these, then don't be mad at the budget and just get those $400 headphones. This is good quality and design for the price....tip: these should come with some instructions to make them more practical to your certain needs such as mine....but For the price, comfort, design  and quality....these are great!  you can't beat it.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,1

"Update:  once again, after 20 minutes, the volume suddenly kicked in to a normal level and the audio started working with the noise cancelation switched off. Must be some kind of glitch.  ______________________________________________My wife order me the E7s and I was very happy with them. I did have an issue like another reviewer where one of the ear pieces broke on the swivel but I was able to fix that with some strong glue. Didn’t swivel anymore but that was fine. I’m not hard to satisfy. However, one evening when I was charging them, the cord heated up so hit it melted the plastic. I burned my thumb when I went to remove the cord and the port actually came out of the headphones. The hard shell was melted around he port. I contacted Corwin and to their credit, they sent me a return label and mailed me the new E8. However, I think there’s a problem with these headphones. There is no audio unless I engage the Noise Cancellation.  Weird. And even then, the sound is VERY low, even turned all the way up. I was chatting online with customer service with the headphones on. They were being pretty dismissive but ultimately asked what I wanted them to do. Just them the volume jumped all the way up. I switched off Noise Cancelation and I still had audio. I turned them off and back in  and the volume was still good so I figured I was good. However, the next time I went to use them, the volume was back to being low and only worked with Noise Cancelation on. I don’t know if these are defective or if it’s an issue with all of them. I kind of wish I’d have just gotten a new pair of the older E7s. If the problem continues much longer I might have to contact Corwin again. Stay posted.",2,1,2019-5-6,1,2,0

I received these yesterday and for the price I was expecting something ok but not necessarily excellent and I have been totally blown away. The sound is just amazing. The Bluetooth connection was super easy too (I don't have a wifi motherboad so I had to order a Bluetooth adapter for 7$ but it works very well).The only drawback I noticed so far is the noise canceling option: it kind of works but when you enable it with the headphones on you can clearly feel a sound quality drop. Since I was not expecting to use it anyway it's not a big deal for me but if it's an important feature for you be aware that it's probably the weakest point of those headphones.,4,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
This is my first pair of over-the-head headphones. I usually use in ear style headphones.  I purchased them to use for an overseas trip.  They work really well.  I was able to listen to my music and movies on my phone without being distracted.  The noise cancelling works quite well.  Having the ability to use an aux cable was really helpful too. I didn't even think about the need to have one during my search for headphones. The fact that I wouldn't have been able to use the them with the in flight entertainment would have been really disappointing but they even came with an aux cable.  I didn't anticipate using them much after that but they have been really useful.  I use them at home when the spouse/child  wants to watch something on the TV.  I can sit next to them and use these to watch or listen to something on my phone/tablet.  It completely immerses you in what ever your listening or watching.  I was amazed that I can put those on and not even hear whats playing on the TV until I take them off.  Great Pair of ANC headphones if your not an audiophile and or dont want to spend 300-500 on some Bose or Sony's.  The battery life on these headphones also appear to be excellent.

"I have used these for a little more than 30 days now, and am very pleased. I had previously bought a higher end JBL set, that I will admit sounded better (not as good as they should for the price). They were almost 3 times the price though, were not as comfortable as these Cowin E-7, and ultimately stopped working in less than 30 days. Bottom line, for what you get at this price (comfort, noise cancelling, bluetooth and NFC, style, durability, crazy long battery life) you'll be hard pressed to find more value in a wireless headset. You can keep searching for the ultimate deal, or just get these. You won't be disappointed. Note: It probably goes without saying, but you won't get an audiophile Hi-Fi experience with these. Those are typically reserved for studio wired type headsets. These sound real good at this price point though.",5,1,2017-5-11,1,3,0
"Now look, I'm not a headphones snob but I will tell you that these have been getting me through quarantine. I can put them on and go listen to music or audio books while my spouse is watching TV. If he's watching TV and I'm trying to sleep, I can listen to ambient noise through them. The one thing that I was hoping for were headphones that would also just play white noise all on their own, and these do not do that, but there are enough YouTube videos of unending white noise that it didn't really matter.It does not cancel ALL noise.

"Quick facts; pretty comfortable, definitely cancel 90% of outside sounds when in that mode. That's the only mode I use, though; there's another setting that just says BT, but it's very muffled. I don't get 30 hours of battery life; it's long, maybe 25, but not 30. Don't really care for the non-stop intermittent beeping when the battery gets low, either. Doesn't even stop when I plug them in to charge. Volume controls work pretty well, but kinda clunky and not overly responsive.

"As a former musician and life-long music lover, I really appreciate a set of 'phones that does a good job reproducing the recorded music.  These headphones exceeded by expectations, given the price.  Would $200, $300 'phones sound better?  Maybe, but I suspect the improvement would be marginal.  Although a bit heavy on the bass, I get excellent mids and very good highs; cymbals are clear and crisp.  Battery life seems good so far.  I have had little opportunity to evaluate the noise cancellation so I can't add much there.

Everyone's heads and ears and tastes in music are different, So, rather than buy one expensive pair and hope for the best, I picked the 40 to 50 dollar range and tried some different models from different brands.

Absolute garbage. Surely all these other reviews are fake. I bought these for my son who has ADHD and has trouble concentrating when he’s doing schoolwork. When we switched to homeschooling because of COVID I knew I needed something that would block out the noise at home (three other siblings and four dogs) so I purchased these because of the amazing reviews. First thing I did was try them on. They are plastic and feel so cheaply designed. I was willing to let that slide if it helped even slightly with helping him concentrate. He tried them on and after four minutes told me he could hear every single thing (just slightly muffled). Really disappointed and hope amazon looks into all these fake reviews. Don’t waste your money!,1,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0

"I am a mechanical engineer for Shure and design high end microphones and headphones.  Because I get a decent discount, my mother in law asked me to get her a pair.  After looking at our catalog I was unable to find something in a similar price range even with my discount.  I admit, my mother in law isn't hosting the Grammys or mixing an album with Alicia Keys, so I decided to look for something else for her to watch Netflix with at night.  These work great for her application.  Super easy set-up and great sound.  They could be a little more comfortable, but are still better than average.  Never really heard a Cowin product prior, so I was pleasantly surprised.",5,1,2019-2-14,1,1,0
"I, originally, gave the product 1 star due to latency. I then did some extensive experimentation. It was my intention to use these with a Bluetooth transmitter connected to the headphone out on my guitar amplifier. It's where I first ran into latency of about 300 milliseconds. Since then I've tried it with online movies, etc. using the same transmitter and found no latency at all. Scratching my head, I connected the transmitter up to my Zoom mixer in my studio and strummed the guitar. 300 ms latency again. I'm still confused as to why this happens. There are no available settings on the Bluetooth transmitter that can be adjusted. I've posted the issue in the Fender Forums but no one had a solution.",4,1,2018-11-2,1,1,0
"After purchasing Amazon Basic headphones due to the lack of money, I experienced terrible build quality, they broke twice. I had to use my brother's only 2013 Beats because I didn't have anything else. When those broke, I decided to buy these, thinking it was going to be to-good-to-be-true. Yet, when they arrived, I already felt the VERY smooth build quality with the very premium metal. I honestly thought I received the wrong headphones... That's not a joke, it seemed crazy these are $50.00, everyone around me with $100+ headphones say ""WOO, nice headphones."" When I say they only costed me $50.00, they can't believe it, I still can't either. I am using a iPhone 6s Plus. On one full charge, these things last a ETERNITY! My only complaint is that noise cancellation doesn't work on a bus, or when windows are opened, also the volume buttons literally skip my song, still don't know why. The Bluetooth mode's volume is WAY too high, with it almost impossible to turn down. I had it at 0.20 volume and it still sounded like 5-6 ticks with headphone cable attached. But, it total, do yourself a favor and get these. The past 2 months I've had these, it still feels incredible, the bag it comes with is incredible. The headphone cable length is exceptionally good. It's all around a 100% fantastic product review. The only thing I would suggest for them moving forward is to make plugging in your headphone cable not use battery. Other than that, amazing product. Recommend to everyone!",5,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
"Great sound! In fact these produce beautiful sound! With the over-ear design there's a natural dampening that takes place. I've owned this for about a year and my only beef is with the noise cancellation. It works but I think it works too well or mine is slightly defective in the right ear. If the headphones aren't on just right (or from what I can tell, slightly wrong in a calculated way by allowing something like a hat to come in between the headphone surface and your skin) a loud repetitions thumping sound occurs. It starts off very soft and progressively gets as loud as a bass drum playing well measured 8th notes (around 240 of these pulsations a minute). It's pretty annoying and I find it intolerable.That said the only time I use noise cancelling is on planes and airports and I don't often fly.

The manufacturer suggested I upgrade the BT app on my smartphone so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that this may correct it, but not knowing how to do that I use the cord included to plug it into my headphone jack & enjoy no interruptions with the many books I enjoy.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0

"I use these headphones around the house, while mowing the lawn, at work, and when I travel, and they work very well for me.  The headphones were reasonably priced, and I've had them for almost two years. When I travel, the airplane engine noise used to bother my ears, especially on long trips. General plane noise made it hard to listen to music or watch movies. But these headphones have helped a lot. They don't eliminate noise completely, which is fine with me because I want to still be aware of what is going on around me. But they reduce the noise to a very low level so I can hear the music or movie. I used them on my last trip to Australia and they were great. The travel was over 25 hours and the batteries still had power when I arrived in Melbourne.Recently the headphone arm broke.

If you want rich, deep bass sound, these simply will not do at all. Listened for 10 minutes and that's all I could tolerate.",2,1,2020-1-11,1,1,0

"I was really looking forward to these headphones :( I ordered them to replace a broken pair of E7s. They broke similarly to how everyone mentions in the reviews, the ear piece separating from the head piece after 6 months. I bought these for the purpose of listening to music at the office, listening to audiobooks at home, and making video conference calls. I was perfectly happy to order a new pair though since they are SO comfortable. They are more comfy than my $150 Razer Thresher gaming headset. I have a large, sensitive head, which means that everything that touches my head gives me a headache after a while. This includes headphones, earbuds, hats, headbands, and even glasses. Finding a headset that is comfortable has always been a priority for me, over sound quality and other features. That is why I love Cowin, their headsets are the most comfortable I’ve tried. They still give me headaches, but it takes a bit longer. The sound is also great and I have never had issues with them before (apart from them breaking).That being said, no amount of comfort is worth the issues I had with these. I could complain about the durability of the materials, or noise cancelling issues, or the extremely limited range of the wireless feature, but my main issue is the volume! I hope this is just an error with my particular set, but I cannot play music at the lowest volume on my phone. The E7s will not work unless I turn then volume up to two, which is louder than I would like it. Even the volume controls on the headset doesn’t make it better. Also, if I am listening to music, the person next to me can hear sound coming from the headphones. I never had this problem with my old Cowins! I bought these so that I could listen to music at the office, but they are useless if my coworkers can hear them!",1,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0

Arrived quickly & well packaged.  The gift was opened in my presence & the packaging & presentation of items inside was quite stylishly done. Unable to give 4.5 stars but that would be my true rating. Only reason I didn't rate a solid 5 stars is because the several similar gifts I've purchased recently came with a nice hardbody case for the item, whereas Cowin headphones came with a cloth drawstring bag.

I bought these looking for something that I could use with my hearing aids and not have feedback.from the proximity of the ear pads to the hearing aid microphone.  These seem to be doing the trick in that respect. These headphones were super easy to pair with my PC, iPhone and iPad.

"This is my first set of noise canceling headphones.  I bought these as I have started flying frequently and disliked having to put my headphone volume at max to drown out the engine roar.  On the first use, I put them on before takeoff and started listening to music.  Once in the air, I took them off to talk to someone and was astounded how much these headphones had been blocking out the engine roar.  Made these well worth the money.  Sound quality is good, bass response is good, overall very happy with these.  My only complaint and reason I didn’t rate them at 5 stars, is that when I turned my head I would get a hard “thumping” sound.  I’d take the headphones off and put them back on again to make the thumping go away, but had to do this a few times during each flight when the thumping returned.  I have found that if these headphones rest against a pillow or seatback, the overwhelming thumping sound occurs every time.

Beats can’t beat these and they are considerably less expensive. They come with a carrying pouch and all of the cords you need, which is lovely. They take a bit to charge out of the box, which I expected, so keep that in mind if you want to use them right away. I never thought I would be able to replace my old headphones with something new (I bought them literally 8 times over the years), but these absolutely did. I’m a fan and will be trying other products from this company. I also love how weighty they feel. To me that just screams good quality.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
The instructions say a long press. Clearly I don't know what a long press is because I tried several times to lower the sound level. My DVR and TV both have fixed volume for bluetooth. Was about to give up and return them when I decided to give them one more try and the volume was normal. Not sure what happened but my frustration level with these headphones is pegged at maximum. Gave 2 stars because they seem OK otherwise. Not the best sound but OK for TV. Might return these anyway because of my frustration level.Came to peace with the headphones. I don't know why I had problems and even less as to why the headphones started working rationally. Now that I can control the volume I am guessing a long press is a few seconds.

Decent over ear headphones w good quality sound for listening to podcasts (not like BOSE for music or other higher end over ear models)  but don’t expect them to replace serious music listening phones.. These work for night podcasts (just have ru sleep on back w neck pillow or take off & switch to in-ear bluetooth phones if I want to side sleep).

"Once you get the connection quirks figured out, it won't be as aggravating. Typically, my TV's sound system needs to be on first, then the earphones turned on for it to disrupt and connect. The automatic noise cancelling is so-so. I have single-pane windows and can hear everything outside. Live like this long enough and you will grow to hate any sound, including car doors, birds, squirrels - anything, even as background noise in movies. The noise cancelling is not good enough to block out the noise if I know it is there. I still have to play something through the headphones to totally block out the loud low sounds like neighbors mowing (not large lawnmowers, but small ones) and an obnoxious neighbor's motorcycle. Noisy birds, dogs down the street, the average car sound, and car radios do get blocked out, as well as the sounds of typing as I write this. Wearing them while doing something like fumbling around the kitchen can be a little disorienting. Every year someone has a street party almost a couple of blocks away and with the headphones and sound playing in them, I was not forced to hear the thumping bass all day. I'm not sure how long the battery can last without being recharged, but I have worn this for well over three hours. Volume controls aren't good. It would be better with a dial of some sort because it requires one to hold down a button long enough to not be considered a ""short press,"" or else it might perform another function like skipping tracks or videos on the connected device. I have only worn this indoors with minimal walking around the house. The headset looks and feels fragile, and I try to be careful with stuff anyway, so I make sure I handle it carefully and grab both earpieces when removing and placing on my head or hold it by the headband.

"These headphones produce more bass than a much older corded set that I own, but I think that bass is excessive compared to true flat sound reproduction.  These headphones are fairly comfortable to wear.  The Bluetooth wireless connection function works, but can be confused if the headphones are used first paired with a TV and then brought near a PC that happens to have Bluetooth.  And if paired with that PC, and thereafter attempted to be used with the TV to which they were previously paired, there may be some difficulty clearing the previous pairing and re-pairing.  Even the original pairing with my 2017 TV was not immediately successful, and instead required several tries despite no other Bluetooth devices anywhere in range.  The range of the Bluetooth function of these headphones appears to be rather variable, sometimes working beyond 30 ft while at many others not working reliably when only 10 ft from the source to which they are paired.Corded function also requires the battery within these headphones to be charged.  And the headphones must be turned off in order to recharge.  Thus, if the battery runs low while listening using the Bluetooth function, you cannot simply connect these headphones directly to your TV or PC via the min--jack cord and continue to listen.",3,1,2018-6-13,1,0,0

They did not come with a wall adapter for the USB cable so if you want to plug them into the wall, you have to find your own charging cube. They did come with an AUX cable which is nice, in case I ever need to actually plug the headphones in. They also came with a travel bag which is nice.So first of all, these headphones are HUGE. I look like a pilot with these things on my head. Secondly, they kind of squeeze my ears/head and it kinda hurts. Thirdly, these headphones do a superb job at cancelling any outside noise, but disappointingly the volume does not turn up loud enough. I feel like A LOT of headphones have this issue, including my Bose earbuds. My computer was at volume setting 82 on a scale of 0-100, and I would have considered it ""normal"" volume. I tried to start a return but because these are from a third party seller (the company that makes them), Amazon wants to charge me $7.61 to return the item via UPS, which is annoying. I personally do not feel these were worth the $60 I paid for them, I think $30 is a more fair price.",4,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"As long as you don't use the Bluetooth on this set of headphones, it's perfect. Sound quality is fantastic for its price, bass is good, the only other thing besides Bluetooth that isn't necessarily that bad, but could improve is noise cancelation. It's not really as great as it's made out to be, but there's definitely still some noise cancelation.Now when it comes to Bluetooth, if you're looking for headphones solely for Bluetooth, do not get this. It uses older Bluetooth technology and is only good for audio. If you try to watch videos with these headphones, there will be some serious lag. Just use the aux cord.",4,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"I got these for Christmas. They are a good headset overall with a few things I wasn't thrilled about. The controls are not real intuitive and it is easy to select the wrong function. The small triangle is not easy to use especially with even a thin glove on (it is winter). The dual function buttons (you tap once to change the track and hold to adjust the volume) make it too easy to get an unintended result. All of that said though, the sound quality is quite good and the noise cancellation is also quite good. They are comfortable to wear for an over the ear style and I actually enjoy using them.  I'll be keeping them, I just wish the function buttons were more convenient/intuitive but it certainly wasn't a deal killer.Update - I have to say the customer service from this company is top notch 5 star! They are quick to respond and back their product 100% That alone is hard to find these days. Now that I have had the headphones for a while, the controls are fine. They just took some getting used to. Good sound and a great seller... hard to beat at this price.",5,1,2018-2-12,1,0,0
"Just got these today, and I am very impressed so far. I didn't expect perfection but these are very nice. The packaging was excellent (unlike some other lower end audio products I've bought in the past) and the headphones are solidly built and look sleek. Bluetooth pairing was a breeze, controls are easy to use and they are comfortable to wear. As for sound quality, I'd rate them about a 7-8 out of 10 overall. There is a noticeable difference in sound quality when listening to music with the active noise cancelling turned on though. With the AC on the sound isn't as rich and it almost reminds me of listening to music in a big room or hall. The AC seems to favor clarity in the mid-range over fullness of bass, and I'd say it removes about 70% of ambient noises. It won't silence a tv or someone talking in the background, but it does a good job removing humming, buzzing, and other low frequencies.  I haven't tried them in a very noisy environment yet though, so it may be better in those situations. I have a 4+ hour flight tomorrow, and I will update this review afterwards with my experience. For the $65 price tag I can't imagine getting anything much better. If you manage your expectations I think you will be pleasantly surprised. These aren't Bose or Sennheiser for sure, but I can't imagine the extra $150 -$200 buying you enough extra sound quality to justify the cost.",5,1,2017-8-14,1,1,0
"I ordered this because it was on one of those lists of Amazon items that get rave reviews. I was still somewhat skeptical when I ordered them but I gave them to my BF as a Christmas gift with a vacation coming a week later that would total 16 hours. He checked them out and was very impressed, so much so that he immediately said he wanted to order a pair for me so I would have them for our trip. I got mine in plenty of time and we were so glad we had them because on one flight there was a poor baby that was crying in pain and we couldn't hear it. I have 4 adult sons, everyone is getting a pair for their birthday this year!",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I saw all the 5 star reviews and decided to buy a pair. I was immediately disappointed.Out of the box these feel flimsy and of weak quality. They are easy enough to setup and use,  but they really don't get very loud at all. At 100% capacity, the speakers are underwhelming at best.",1,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"I needed a good pair of sturdy sound-cancelling headphones to use during my workouts at the gym to listen to my audio books.  These fit the bill perfectly.  I have been using them for about 1 month now and am very pleased.  They stay in place, the ear coverings are soft, comfortable and are easy to clean after my workout.  The battery life is excellent, I get two to three two-hour workouts with just one charge.  The sound quality is very good and the Cowin connects to my iPhone with no problems at all.  The adjustments fit my head perfectly, but someone with a larger head may have an issue as the phones are extended to their farthest when I wear them.  They're made of plastic but are sturdy.  I just drop them in my gym bag and go.  So far, no problems.  I'd buy them again.",5,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0
"These E7 headphones are a screaming deal.  They cost a tiny fraction of what my Bose QC35s cost, and while they aren’t quite at ($300) Bose level, the noise cancellation is amazing for my office and the sound is pretty good.Initially I had some trouble getting the controls working consistently with my AlienWare laptop; Cowin was amazing at getting that fully resolved.  Their after-sales support is as amazing as their value.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0
"I do not have prior experience with headphones, so this review comes from a new user.  I can't compare them to other options.  I just wanted a way to eliminate the physical cord/wires to connect my cell phone to the headphones.  I also listen mostly to talk radio, not music, while working out on our property.  The headphones are really comfortable.  Outside sound/noise is almost completely eliminated.  It paired seamlessly via Bluetooth with my iPhone 11.  I would definitely buy these headphones again, but I can't comment on sound quality for music playback (which I realize is what most people are probably interested in).",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0

"OVERALL: Excellent product. Works as expected with no issuesSOUND: I use mine in an environment with lots of ambient noise. In noise reduction mode, the ambient noise is barely noticeable.

"I bought these in April, worked great. Nice soft case included, solid battery life before a charge is needed. Comfortable.  Sound is OK. I can hear office noise around me, but it's not terrible. (i.e. Not exactly Noise Cancelling.) OK for the price. Customer Support is poor. In September my Aux cord stopped working. No Sound. Warranty for headphones is for eighteen (18) months. I emailed customer support and followed all the troubleshooting instructions they suggested. I was told my cord would be replaced if needed. After troubleshooting (charging, bluetooth check, cleaning, swapping out cords) realized the original Aux Cord was faulty. I replied to Support again with the results asking for the warranty to be covered for the Aux Cord. I immediately got bounce back emails. (6-8 Bounce backs ""Recipient inbox full""; several days in a row) Also, the support phone number on the website goes straight to voice mail; No professional identification as Cowin on the voice recording and tells me I've reached ""xxx-xxx-xxxx"" - a completely different number than the Support# listed. Who knows who is at the number listed. I've not been able to reach Cowin since.UPDATE Got an email from Cowin customer service, October 2018: ""Thank you for your interest in our replacement parts but we are not selling/replacing them. We are very sorry for this discrepancy, But the only solution is to find another aux cable in your local tech store or amazon!""",3,1,2018-10-11,1,0,0
"If you're looking to dip your toe into the Bluetooth headphones world and this is your entry price point, it's a pretty decent one. The Bluetooth connection is lightning quick, solid battery life, super comfortable, and the noise cancelling feature is awesome. The quality of the sound is a bit less than what I'd like it to be, though, and feels like they have the bass turned up while the treble and melody falls into the background. It creates a sort of echo that I'm not over the moon about, but gets the job done if your commute is short enough to not really mind it for half an hour twice a day. The buttons are also pretty weird and don't make any sense (the volume up is on the bottom rather than top, and you also have to long press to increase the volume as opposed to short tap to skip to the next song. You'll definitely mess it up the first few times), but after using it for less than a day I'm already used to it. Overall I'd keep these as a back up pair and shop around for something a bit better sound quality for daily use.",3,1,2017-11-21,1,2,0
I'm writing the review based on different 5 points1. I personally the appearance is very good so that is a 5/5 for me. I like all the colors. and I might have bought a blue one or blue black or w/e but I like the all black one that I bought.,4,1,2017-12-9,1,1,0
"These broke in under a year. The speaker section separated from the head strap where they connect and make a rotating connection. I fix it once, but at that point the clip that held these together was shot. In a last ditch effort I JB Welded it together which lasted just long enough to order a set of Mpow headphones.",1,1,2019-12-30,1,2,0
"I've never owned a pair of noise-canceling headphones so comparing these to others wouldn't be something I could do. BUT, I can say that this pair is really nice! I just went on a trip and used them several days for at least 7 hours each time. The battery lasted no problem and my ears didn't hurt at all. I heard from people I know who have other brands that the pads would end up pressing too hard against the ear--therefore, making the ear hurt after only a couple hours use. These, zero pain. They were very comfortable. They also lay flat making it easy to pack away in my carry-on luggage. All in all, for the money, these are great. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. Oh, and the sound is good too! I rated it 4 stars vs 5 only because nothing is truly perfect ;)",4,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0
"Love these headphones. Use them to mow the lawn. Knocks most of the mower noise (19 HP Gas Rider) down to a level so I can still enjoy my podcasts.The microphone in this unit is unit leaves a lot to be desired.

"I bought these (blue) for work after having a pair for years (black). The sound is great the noise cancelling is great on my phone and my Chromebook but when it connects to my 2017 MacBook pro work computer, the sound turns to patchy garbled nonsense. I have other headphones paired to that MacBook so I know it's not the computer. Tried all sorts of Bluetooth debugging and it's definitely not a 'me' issue",1,1,2019-7-4,1,2,0
"I got these to help me through some colicky baby nights. Her crying was driving me up the wall, so I put these on and listen to some music and they really did the trick. I could hold/rock/breastfeed my screaming baby all night and not be ready to jump out a window. Thank you Cowen for saving my life! Lol.On a serious note, these work really well, for the price. The noise cancellation is less than perfect, but it definitely has noise reductive qualities. The bass is pretty great and my music sounds great in these and they are suuuper comfy on my head. Don’t compare them to Bose. But I spent $59 on these, not $500, so, there’s that.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I don't use these to listen to music, so I cannot attest to the bass that everyone seems to love, but I do use these extensively for work, listening to tv and radio commentators and journalists, and I can say, without a doubt, that these headphones are great.  The voices sound true, not ""tinny,"" and I can easily differentiate between speakers who may sound alike.  The bluetooth has good range (I could walk to the opposite end of my house--easily 75 feet) and still hear commentary/conversation), and the battery lasts forever on one charge.  I can easily get two days from a single charge.Before looking at this model of COWIN headphones, I did look at competing brands and models, as well as hundreds of reviews, and I decided to take the plunge and purchase a pair of COWIN headphones.  I am so glad I did.  They easily compete with the more expensive brands at a fraction of the cost.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"Adding this because I didn't notice this stated anywhere : the headphones must be charged to be used, even with the wire plugged into a device. I didn't think this would be the case, but there's only 3 states: off, bluetooth and active noise cancelation. The instruction booklet states the headphones must be charged to use.The power usage times are pretty spot on. 40hrs if you don't use the anc. About 30 if you do.",4,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"If I could give these more stars I would- I was very surprised at the sound quality! I got these so that my husband and I could listen to music while we mow and now go deaf in the process. I can listen to audio books on our mower which is not quiet by any means. I don't use the noise canceling feature because I like to hear the mower a little to make sure it's not breaking on me, but seriously these are worth it for the price, and the battery life is surprisingly long- I constantly forget to charge it and they still work for me! If there were a downside to these it would be that you have to be close to your phone to use them, but really thats to be expected.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"So they HAVE a feature called noise cancellation.  I guess in SOMEONES explanation, they cancel noise....the noise coming from your headphones.  IDK maybe I'm expecting much from a pair of $60 dollar headphones but idk....alas they are GREAT headphones otherwise...well kinda...im torn....i have big gauges in my ears so maybe i need something with bigger earphones.  and its tight around my head...oh and you cant fold them down.  the headband is one solid piece however its pretty flexible...with a two year warranty for 5 dollars I guess its still a pretty great pair of headphones...sound quality is crisp and bass pumps!!!",3,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0

"I have a very nice pair $300 headphones I primarily use for gaming and late nite action movie watching and such.  Then I have the Cowin E7, which I use at work and travel for music and noise cancellation.  I have used my $300 from time to time at work and travel, and to be honest, the sound is better, but the noise cancellation is about the same.  Also, the playback time on the Cowin is nearly twice as long.  So I prefer to use the Cowin E7 at work and when I travel, because the sound quality is more than adequate and I don't want to risk losing my $300 headphones.",4,1,2018-12-21,1,1,0

My son managed to break these one day while putting them on during a roadtrip. He's got 3 or 4 pairs he rotates through depending on what he's doing but he really likes the noise-cancellation on these and they have been his go to set for trips.Looks like the internal ring holding the ear piece to the headband broke. A small fragment fell out and it looks like pretty low-grade plastic. Amazing they lasted this long.,1,1,2019-8-13,1,2,1
"Well the wireless works well, range is excellent throughout the whole house. Setup is a breeze The Bluetooth sound is borderline unlistenable, however. On familiar acoustic music they have that bottom-of-the-well sort of sound, tinny and distorted as if they are being overloaded, even at modest listening levels. The sound through the cable is quite good, a bit bass-heavy but not different from most modern design cans, I reckon. The ear-cups are small but I have a punkin that's like a 7-3/4...",2,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"I work in a noisy environment and I had bought these headphones for their so called and highly publicized ""Active noise cancelling"", but to my active dismay, the only noise cancelling effect is the oversized ear muffs of these headphones. I am still wondering if I got a defective piece or is it just misinformation by the manufacturers.The sound quality is pretty average and probably comparable to other bluetooth headphones available at a cheaper price point in the market. If you are looking for any potent noise cancellation, keep on looking.",5,1,2018-12-14,1,0,0
"At first, I loved these headphones. They have solid build quality, comfort, and a surprisingly effective active noise cancellation mode. However, after only 2 months of use, they suddenly refused to turn on after charging. Normally this would not be a problem because you could contact customer support and solve your problem. After 2 report forms filled, and nearly 2 weeks of waiting, I have had no response from COWIN, and no patience to continue this process. I have attached photos below showing that the headphones are in fact unharmed. The ""charging"" LED does turn on as if the headphones were getting power. However, they will not turn on.I cannot recommend a product that breaks without cause and has no customer support. Very disappointed with my purchase.",5,1,2018-2-2,1,3,1
"I've had these for over a year and use them for at least ten to twenty hours a week. I mainly got them to listen to music and block out coworkers chatter. I chose this particular set because they were the most reasonably priced headphones with a four star review. Should have spent a bit more and gotten a better pair.The noise cancellation works fine when stationary. When I get up to move around I get distortion. Same thing if I turn my head too fast.  I have no complaints about the sound or battery life. The battery lasts about 30 hours. The only caveat is if the battery dies, you can't charge it while listening to the headphones.",2,1,2019-10-17,1,1,0
"We were underwhelmed. The price is certainly a lot lower than some of the top brands, but the sound is noticeably muddier as well. It's not bad and works well for music at lower volumes or spoken content, but they definitely lack punch.  Audiophiles are best to pay for better audio quality, but for those on a tight budget or kids perhaps, these are fine otherwise. Hardware quality is good and they're reasonably comfortable for over the ear headphones, but still get a little hot and tight feeling after wearing them for awhile.",3,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"Got these headphones for a few reasons, wireless/bluetooth, length of charge, quality and noise cancellation. I give them 5 stars for everything but the noise cancellation.No problem at all syncing the headphones with my phone or my computer. 30 hr playback time is legit. I can use these basically all work week without having to charge them (using them 4-5 hours per day). The sound quality is great and they are very comfortable to wear.",4,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"I loved the price and the different colors; blue is my favorite color, so it was nice to get headphones in blue. The earpieces are soft, very comfortable and fit around my ears perfectly like they were sized to my ears (I have small ears FYI). The set-up and button controls are very easy and the sound quality is excellent; I have heard tones/sounds and words in songs that I hadn't heard before, SERIOUSLY and I'm talking about in some songs that are 15, 20 years old that I've heard hundreds if not thousands of times. The sound doesn't get garbled or scratchy sounding when you increase the volume; in fact, I turned it to the max just to see and still GREAT sound! The active noise canceling is great; it does not cut out 100% of voices, but 98-99% is good enough for me...the noise canceling is so good that wearing them while I type, I literally can barely hear myself typing, and it may be more of a ""I see myself typing thing so I hear it a little bit'""! They paired easily with my phone and laptop, the controls are on the right side and again are very easy to learn/remember. After researching active vs. passive, white noise, wired vs wireless, etc., I actually made the final decision as these were listed on a website in the top 5 best noise canceling headphones for students, which was my need for them, to study in peace; the ability to listen to music is a bonus. BUT, here's the BEST part; that battery that they advertise that lasts 30 hours that I'm sure many people don't believe, BELIEVE IT, BELIEVE ME! They say to charge it for 8 hours when you first get it, but it's already mostly charged and I think it took an hour if that to reach full charge. I opened and charged it when I got it on 4/22; I have used these headphones all but on 3 days since each time for a minimum of 8 hours, most days it was about 10 and the longest time was for about 12 hours on a single occasion (it is 4/30 as I write this review); the battery indicator that appears on my phone when playing music is still completely FULL! So I have gotten more than 30 hours of use out of them and the battery indicator has not moved; I am truly amazed and more than satisfied! Bonuses: the carrying bag, wire to connect to your laptop and ""VIP"" card for you to register online which gives you an additional 6 months to your warranty. My ONLY con: the charging cord is way too short.",5,1,2019-4-30,1,0,1
"The sound quality under blue tooth is barely acceptable.  It is about the quality of a pair from an overstock store or your local pharmacy.It does have the redeeming quality of a bit of passive noise canceling build into the structure.  The active noise canceling, if it works, barely works.  When the passive noise canceling is turned on there is a feeling of air pressure against the ear drums.",2,1,2019-3-9,1,1,0
"I got the headphones earlier today and got them charged up. I was pleasantly surprised to see how they were made and constructed.  They are a bit heavy to hold, but once they were on my head, they didn't feel as heavy at all.  In fact, I was amazed how light they felt wearing them.  The sound quality is beyond excellent.  I was also amazed at the stereo separation.  The bass is good as well as the rest of the sound spectrum.  It was nice to hear such detail in most any song I played at a reasonable level and at a much higher level.  I was however, I bit unsure about how they sounded with the noise cancelation turned on - it made the mid range sound a bit exaggerated and left the highs and lows a bit lower.  However, I did notice that any ambient noise in the house was reduced.  The only thing I did not like was the power switch as it was a bit hard to turn on or change from one setting to another.  It's not a big deal, but it does take a bit to adjust it. I really liked how I could adjust the volume or change tracks I was listening to with the same button, very nicely designed feature.  They paired with my iPad Pro flawlessly and quickly.  Overall, a great set of headphones that I would recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably affordable, quality set.",5,1,2017-8-15,1,1,0

"If you're considering these, save a little bit of money and buy the option without noise cancelling. You will never use it, it's horrid. The sound quality of the headphones, otherwise, is decent. One thing I don't understand is why the power has to be on in order to listen though the headphone cable. My previous Bluetooth headphones were cheap piece of junk and even with them I could connect to multiple devices and when the battery died, in the middle of a movie, I would just connect the headphone cable and continue watching. With these, you can only connect to one device at a time and they have to be charged and on to use even with the cord.",4,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0

The adapters I bought to be able to use wired headsets with my iPhone 11 did not last long, which is very frustrating.Overall the sound quality is great. They're comfortable even though I wear eyeglasses and these are not over-the-ear headphones. The noise-canceling feature is pretty decent, as they are able to block out most of the outside the apartment noises. We live in an apartment complex with several neighbors who like to sit in their cars blasting music or in their apartment blasting music. This has helped me out quite a lot as hearing ""music"" from outside the apartment is very annoying to me.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
I used to have a Bose noise cancelling headset years ago (before it was stolen).  I replaced it with a Samsung due to cost.  Bose being $350 and the Samsung about $200 (don't really recall).  The Bose and Samsung were about the same.  They both used a soft noise as a noise cancelling device and it was noticeable.  Especially for someone with hyperacusia.  But they both worked well.  I really liked the small size of the Bose.Cowin has exceeded all expectation and for a very small price.  There is no background noise at all.  Noise cancelling is  extremely good without that buzzing noise.,5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
"I am in my mid-60s and have struggled finding moderately priced Headphones that have great sound, great active noise cancelling (ANC) and especially great earcup comfort (at my age this is very critical in a Headphone). I have tried numerous other brands and always had to sacrifice 1 of my criteria to achieve the moderate price point I desired. So, when I purchased these Cowin E7 I had modest expectations about what I would receive and what would be sacrificed.Quite simply put, these Headphones blew me away. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality from these Headphones in all my criteria areas. These remind me more of headphones I have tried that are 2-3 times the price.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,1,1
"I use these with my MacBook Air and about 75% of the time I have no issues, but the other 25% of the time they 'skip'.  The sound is extremely choppy.  If I am watching a show or youtube I only get every 3rd or 4th word and the noise cancelling doesn't cancel out anything my earbuds (which are not noise cancelling) don't.  On the up-side they have a very long battery life and are quite comfortable.  You definitely get what you pay for.Pros:",2,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
"The sound quality and the white noise are both great, which would be the most important things. My biggest complaint is the beeping notification when the battery is low - it beeps every 15 seconds or so which pretty much ruins whatever you're listening to. The battery still might last another hour and that beeping won't stop. It's nice that it warns me the battery is low, I just wish I could push some button to acknowledge the low battery and turn the beeping off.",4,1,2017-4-6,1,4,0
"Well, first, they’re classy looking and stylish, appearing more costly than they really are. That actually concerned me a bit at first, because a lot of the best looking headphones just really are mostly hype. That is definitely not the case with these ones they are quality built and sturdy. The battery life seems pretty decent, and I haven’t had the issue of them dying on me as yet; however, I'm a fairly new owner. They’re also quite comfortable. They are also pretty lightweight, so they don’t end up feeling heavy on your head, I have that issue with a lot of brands. Another plus for these headphones. On the topic of comfort, these feature swiveling ear cups. I didn’t realize how important these were for comfort until I owned these. Little minor adjustments that you make while wearing these from time to time definitely help for wearing these over long periods. I don’t think I’ll ever own a pair that doesn’t have this feature. All in all, this headset is classy, stylish and functional from an aesthetic and feature standpoint. I highly recommend them.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,1
"My father has a set of Bose noise-cancelling headphones so I have only those for comparison regarding noise cancelling: these headphones are quite good at blocking out excess noise while allowing you to hear more pressing things like someone speaking to you (a plus for me!). But even outside where cars are running & bugs are making so much sound, the headphones do a very good job at reducing the extra noise so you can enjoy whatever it is you're trying to listen to.The design is also quite attractive and I've already gotten quite a few compliments, though I hope the material lasts a long time despite the price range & lightweight feel. The chrome bits are plastic, so keep that in mind with use and handling.",5,1,2019-8-29,1,1,0
"Love the fit and feel. Dislike that only have had this since Aug of 2018 and it does not hold a charge. Within an hour and a half starts dying. So much for the 30 hours of use. Cannot watch an entire movie. Sound quality very good and noise cancellation is also good, but battery life is atrocious. Cowin tell me how to get this replaced. I am within the 18 months and very Un-Happy with this.Update: 5 Apr. Received email back from Customer Service on the 3rd and was given code to re-order a new replacement. Received via UPS next day (4 Apr). Charged over night and will see how this one goes over the next few months. I change from 2 stars to 3 because of quick Customer Service and fast replacement. Will update again at a later date. Thank You for the fast response, but was not sure if it was because or review on Amazon, the review on Cowin Website or because I also sent an email to Cowin Customer Service, but was impressed non the less to have received support.",4,1,2019-3-31,1,0,0
"These are great headphones for the price. I assume that the very pricey models cancel noise even more effectively, but I like these for blocking out office noise while working and plane noise while flying. They cancel most noise well. Easy to pair with my phone via bluetooth. This may be a feature of all noise-cancelling headphones, but they only cancel noise when you have audio playing through them. If you wear them and don't play music or something, they don't cancel noise. I downloaded an album of ""noise cancelling music"" (basically very slow gentle music with nature sounds) to use when I'm working and don't want the distraction of music.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"The unit synced easily after I followed the directions . The range is quite far too....I've been able to walk around the house with only a little dropout at the ""max"" range (38 feet) indicated in the manual. Clarity and quality of the sound is very good. It takes a couple sec's to sync up when you turn he headset on.If it doesn't syncup open bluetooth window  go to Audio and re-connect.  Noise cancelling does reduce ambient outside noise well.Battery life is very good too, still lots of battery life after 10 hours or so on. The ear cups are a bit small and need to be larger  So far I am happy with these headphones.  For me they are worth the money.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
The good:Noise canceling,3,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"General sound quality is acceptable, but not outstanding. Noise cancellation performance is mediocre at best - a slight reduction in the volume of external sound, but not what I would consider true noise cancelation. Most of the reduction simply comes from the fact that they are over-the-ear headphones.Bluetooth performance is atrocious. The headphones connect okay initially, but after about 20-30 minutes of use glitches would start to occur in the audio, which would become progressively worse over 1-2 minutes until the audio was completely unusable. The only way to recover was to power cycle.",1,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"I bought these primarily for traveling and wore them on 2 long flights.  They were comfortable and held up well.  They were perhaps a bit larger than I expected compared to the previous version I replaced.  I hope that means they hold up better too.  The one oddity is that the noise canceling only works when using Blue Tooth,  When i plugged in the cord to listen to the airplane movie, the noise canceling cut out.  I will say that even without it, that the sound was good and I wasn't distracted by the noise around me.  The battery has held up well and still shows about 75% charge.  I also bought the hard carrying case",4,1,2017-7-5,1,3,0
"I bought this product during prime day for 40+. There is nothing better than these headphones. Awesome sound quality, instant connection with my MAC and iPad. Even without noise cancellation I can't hear anything from outside. Overall this is several time better than big brand models. Only negative, if I have really find one is that size wise they are are on the bigger side. Now this is based on just few days of use and I haven't charged it since first charge after receiving. So battery life is great. I don't mind charging every few days. I use 2-3-4 hour everyday. You can enjoy high quality music with them for long.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"Worked for 2 days flawlessly.  Third day Bluetooth stopped. Even bought a new Bluetooth adapter and it failed with that one. Now I do have a 6 year old computer but I am running latest version of Windows 10. It works fine with the cord attached so that's why 2 stars but if you have an older computer (4 + years or more then you may want to look elsewhere. I could have saved money if I had gone with a corded set of Head phones. I really wanted this to work.Update: Corded Headphones now cutting out, battery fully charged.  I believe I got a defective product am returning for refund. Have already ordered a corded set of headphones.",1,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"WOW, I must admit that I was hesitant at first to purchase this product. My hesitation stems from not knowing if this non-brand name product would be worth my time of day in regards to overall quality. This product is a true example of how you should not ""judge a book"" before you read it. It is totally amazing and the sound quality is just a good, and if not better than the top brand names in this particular industry. So, I endorse this product because of its great quality, price, and overall comfortable fit. This product is truly worth your time and very affordable to your budget as well - Totally Amazing !!!",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"Very impressive looking headphones and packaging presentation. However, upon testing the headphones I found the range of noise quieting was only a narrow band of frequencies. I say quieting because I didn’t witness actual noise cancelling. My primary need is for eliminating jet noise when a passenger and eliminating shop noise from my electrical equipment. Random noise like banging a hammer and clapping your hands was not suppressed. The acoustical performance of the physical earmuffs, themselves, did the major portion of noise suppression. Using a frequency generator and a pair of speakers, I slowly swept the audio spectrum and note that lower frequencies were better suppressed, however, higher frequencies were heard more easily.",2,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"These sound and feel Like Professional Quality Headphones. They are Robust and feel like the best Materials went into making them. Nothing about them feels Cheap, or like any corners were cut. The Bass is unbelievable, and Noise Cancellation is superior to anything I’ve used so far.The ONLY thing I haven’t liked is, trying to register for their Warranty. When I used my QR scanner, it takes me to FB Messenger , but that’s it. Nothing actually allowed me to Activate my warranty. I wish they would put as much time and effort into making the registration process easy, as they did in making Pro Quality Headphones",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I want to like them, but when I walk with them the sound cuts out on the left side. Super annoying if I move and a little. Otherwise they sound fine and the noise cancellation is good.Update 3/1/2019:",5,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"I bought these to cancel out my wife's snoring. It does not work and the base sounds like crap, it raddles rather than booms. I have a pair f Bose that I've used for years while traveling international with my job and they work fantastic and they're over 15years old and still sound great 👍. Can't hear snoring unless it's real loud and then it's not enough to keep me awake. These headphones are not worth 5 bucks th he sound & noise canceling both suck.",2,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
"I've had these for about a year. They have held up very well. They connect easily to phone or computer with bluetooth. The charge lasts a LONG time and the charge has not diminished after one year. The noise cancelling is not the best, but it does wipe out a lot of background hum. Great for on the plane. But it does not create silence. It does work though. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend. You can pay a lot more for some comfortable over the ear noise canceling bluetooth headphones, but you will not get the cost/benefit bang for your buck that you get with these!",5,1,2019-3-23,1,1,0
"I was expecting sub-$100 headphones to be a flop and after a couple of weeks wearing them, I'm happy to say I was wrong. They have great sound with just enough bass for my tastes and they are the most comfortable over ear headphones I've ever had. After some technical difficulties with my Bluetooth (my end, not theirs), I'm easily using them on my PC, my phone, and my tablet. These are a good investment, definitely.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,1,0
"I have a couple of criticisms. One is that the audio cable that comes with the headphones broke really quickly for me. It is nice that that isn't directly attached to the headphones as this would have made them unusable within a month. I think the cabling tends to be the thing that fails quickest, so being able to replace cables is kind of a bonus. I bought these as a replacement https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076BFZDG2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. Another thing that I didn't realize is that you can't actually use the headphones without them being charged, which seems a little strange to me and kind of limits the usefullness of the headphones. Other than those design issues the sound is good and the noise cancelling is noticeable for plane flights.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,1,0
"So far, overall the head phones are good; comfortable and they work fine on bluetooth & wired and mic works fine.  One problem area is the noise canceling, there is NO difference in background noise when it is turned on. Really the background noise seems to increase because the played sound goes down a little when NC is turned on.  I'm basing this on constant traffic that I hear.  I suppose, for the price, they are decent headphones and based on that other higher end NC headphones are at least double the price; I got what I paid for, if not paid a little more.  I'll hang on to them for now and continue to test it out.Update, I bought real Bose noise canceling headphones. So much better but paid more obviously, was worth it. I give the Cowins 2.5 stars and will give them to a kid in my family, good use for them.",3,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I bought these for my college kids on campus and dorm life. He claimed they were great both in quality and noise cancelling. I was desperate to find him a Christmas gift and bought him Beats Studio Pro headset. He likes this item better. I now have these and TOTALLY agree. The sound and comfort is much better then the Beats Studio Pro. Great 3D sound, bass and comfort. These are legit.👍",5,1,2020-3-18,1,1,0
"UPDATE May 2018:Last year I ordered a Cowin E7 bluetooth headset. I use it for Audio more than video, block office, airline, and hotel distractions. Earlier this year I found a need to exchange the headset. First, it was the least painful exchange experience I could imagine - their customer service excelled in every way and I have only good things to say about them. As far as the replacement product, build quality, fit, finish are all top notch. Audio quality is still way above what a headphone in this price range should have, and is simply serendipitous. Bass comes through with a sense of pressure you can feel - highs stay tight and controlled. Noise cancelling, once you understand what it is and isn't is quite good - if I turn them off, they have good sound isolation to begin with which has often been enough for my needs. I get a full day's use from a single charge, and they hey have never hurt hurt to wear over the course of the day (though, they can get warm, I put that down to their ""closed"" to ventilation construction.",5,1,2018-2-28,1,0,0

"I have purchased multiple BoseQuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones, but at $250 a pop I wanted to see if there was anything out there that was more affordable.  Fortunately I stumbled upon the Cowin E7.These are fantastic headphones for the price.  I primarily use noise cancellation for listening to audiobooks in my noisy car or at the gym.  The Corwins do a great job of getting rid of the background noise so I can follow my book.",5,1,2019-2-3,1,0,0
"I can honestly say there is nothing that I disliked about these headphones. With that being said, I’m only comparing these with the only earbuds I’ve been using for the past 2 years!! The NOISE CANCELING is pretty good. Blocks out most minor/medium range noises out.SOUND QUALITY  is nice/clear.",3,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I would recommend these headphones to anyone! They're great quality at a reasonable price. This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I don't know how I ever lived without them. They have a surprisingly far range, so you can easily listen to music while cleaning or otherwise moving away from your computer. They're comfortable to wear. They are noise cancelling in the sense that running water, noise from other electronics, etc. will be cancelled out. But you can still hear people if they speak loudly. They charge via USB and the charge lasts a decent amount of time. I'm very happy with this purchase!",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"In my opinion these are fun to use and great for noise canceling! But I don’t feel like the sound or bass is particularly special, sounds clear and nice, but the same as maybe Apple AirPods or something of the sort. But it is cheaper so you expect it. Also, I wish the sound could blast louder, I want the option to blow out my ears. Battery literally seems to never die, and it doesn’t take long to charge or Connect to your phone. I wish the turn up or down volume were switched so turning something up was the button on top of the button pad which makes more sense, and also, I wish the individual speakers could rotate 360 degrees and had a lock in function to keep them from slipping.",4,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"I bought these mainly for use when I mow.  The corded earbuds kept getting pulled out of my ears when I get them caught on something.  So I bought bluetooth earbuds.  Was happier BUT, there was still so much noise from the mower that I had the volume so high I was probably doing more damage than good on my ears.  I bought the E7 Cowin headphones and couldn't be happier.  They are so comfortable and the sound and noise reduction are great.  I can even listen to an audiobook while I mow.  My husband even tried them and liked them very much.  He uses them while on load heavy equipment and thinks the are great.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"I had bought a COWIN E7 last year and my brother took it from me because it was definitely a lot better than any one he had used. Then, in February, I bought a new one because I couldn't do without one, but in a few days it stopped working. When I contacted the company, they quickly wrote me and provided a new one, free of charge and faster. I think it is important to give this testimony here, because I am very happy with the company's commitment and the willingness of its employees to minimize our frustrations. Lexi was amazing and helpful. I love my headphone COWIN E7 even more now because, in addition to being a high quality product with a battery that lasts for hours (it's unbelievable), the company respects its customers. Best choice!",5,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
"I have had these for a month or so and love the quality and sound. I have a pair of Bose that I use on the airplanes so I can say the sound cancelling is pretty close to that. I haven't tried these on a plane yet though. But, just the everyday house noise is taken care of with these for sure. They are very comfortable on my ears. I even did a whole afternoon of yardwork with them on and was very comfortable and helped with the thatcher noise. I don't turn them up to drown out the yard equipment, that would be dangerous. But they did buffer the noise so much on a low setting that I had to lift one ear to make sure what was happening with my thatcher.  Connects to devices easily.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
I will start this review off by stating that these are the best pair of noise cancelling headphones that I have ever purchased! I bought these based on the high recommendations from a person that I am following on Twitter so I did not really know what to expect when I finally had them shipped to me. I will break this down by the following:1. Appearance,5,1,2017-8-26,1,2,0
"This headset looks great and scores decent in noise cancellation and sound quality. However, I have a few complaints:- Trying to get Bluetooth pairing and reconnecting to work is a nightmare. I have tried pairing and connecting with mobile phones, car dashboard and PC. The headset exhibits the same issues with all these plaforms.",2,1,2019-11-10,1,2,0
"Not your $200 headphones but for around $50 they are not bad.  Noise cancellation option, to me, just reduces the sound level.  Didnt notice a major difference in NC.  I believe the sound quality if better with NC off.  FIt is ok.  After an hour my ears hurt a bit but that probably has more to do with my big head and ears than the product itself.  Bass is good.  Mid-range maybe a little muffled.  Voices on some non-music video's a little hard to hear although I do have a hearing loss so that could also be it.  Over all I like the product and would recommend them for purchase.  If you are wanting superior sound and NC quality you may want to spend a little more.  If you are wanting a decent headphone set then these would do it.",4,1,2019-6-23,1,0,0
"I have had these headphones for about 3 months now, and they are incredible. A few key highlights:- Pairs easily with phones and laptops, though once in a while i do have to turn off and on when switching between devices. However, it connects within 2-3 seconds.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"The ear pieces were too bulky and heavy for me giving me a headache shortly after putting the headphones on.  They didn't seem to have much bass compared to other headphones.  Sound quality seemed to be ok, but I also didn't keep them on long enough to give them a fair shot at their potential.  As for noise cancelling, I didn't test them around noise, so I couldn't tell you yay or nay on that.  I also don't like the way the ear pieces swivel about.  All in all, just not the headphones for me.",2,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
"As I write this review, I have my headphones on listening to Chilledcow on YouTube.  Awesome noise canceling capabilities in the COWIN SE7 makes studying, working or relaxing possible as these headphones help you drown-out ambient noise to ease distractions.  Great for folks like me who travel a lot and tend to get easily distracted (Adult ADHD).  No need to spend $$$ on ""big brand"" headphones.  Buy these and carry on!",5,1,2018-9-15,1,3,1
"A buddy of mine has a pair of the Bose noise canceling headphones. When you turn them on, all noise in the world disappears. Don't expect that these, at a fraction of the cost, will do the same thing.I did wear them while running the mower and they did cut down on the noise quite a bit.",4,1,2018-12-3,1,2,0
"Great for the price! Nice bass response, and good range, too! They easily paired with all my BT devices.They fit my head (7 5/8 hat size) although they look stretched!",4,1,2018-1-27,1,0,0
"I bought these for my husband as he recently lost his Bose on a travel trip. I decided to give these headphones a shot as they had great reviews and the price is much easier to swallow than the cost of new Bose. The first trip my husband took with these was an 18 hour flight so he was able to give them a good test. He loves them! Says they are every bit as good quality as the Bose were and they were comfortable to wear for hours. I gave them a test too and was presently surprised! I would highly recommend giving these headphones a try. Just don't buy the Cowin case for them because that was poorly made and did not last the first trip as the zipper and loop to hook it on your bag, broke. My husband would have lost these due to that if he did not hear them hit the floor.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"Sure there are some improvements one could ask for.  The folks reporting the ear cups were a tad small, they're right.  But for the price paid compared to ""those"" guys, this is one fantastic set of wireless headphones.  Comfortable enough for binge watching or gaming.  Great volume control.  Decent sound quality to the point I find myself using them to watch some streaming programs even if I'm the only one in the house. The ear cups, yeah I guess I'd agree they could have been just a tad more generous but it's not like I'm feeling all squished in there I mean...it could just be a bit better.  I can't say I notice a ""5 -Star Bass""...but maybe that's a good thing, maybe the sound is just so well balanced I'm not picking up over bass, over mids etc.  I'm ok with that.  I bought them so my wife and I could both utilize our laptops to stream entertainment while sitting 3 ft from each other in our ""now we're getting old"" chairs.  For this, they exceed my expectations.",5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
"I really like the design and sound quality of these headphones. They pair quickly and easily. I’m giving only 3 stars because the noise canceling isn’t that good. When I switch them to the NC setting without using music, a pc , or the like , I hear as much noise as if I had them off. When playing music, the NC setting works fairly well, but only if I have the volume 50 to 100 percent. I will keep them because of the sound , build , and style quality, but as far as noise canceling, I am not happy with the lack of being able to block out unwanted noise. The unit was fully charged so I cannot understand why I have to play music loudly to block out noise. I had high hopes that these would give me some peace and quiet with the NC setting on and being used alone or with music.",3,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
"I'm very pleased with these headphones -- I received them as a gift during the ""COVID"" stay at home orders so that I can more easily take phone calls and be ""isolated"" but also be in the same room with the rest of the family.I am able to ignore the sound of 3 kids homeschooling/playing games, while taking a work call with customers...and the customers don't have any issues with the sounds of the kids.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"After a week of use, i feel that i can review these headphones. They do have clear audio, and depending in the audio file being played, you will either hear a strong bass or a weak bass. Controls are a little confusing sometimes but nothing that bad to complain about. Reason for 4 stars is because i mainly use these for working out, and the headphones do not stay in one place throughout my workout. I have to readjust, tilt, snug and tilt, or position the headphones a certain way so they wont slide off my head, thats pretty much the only downside to these headphones, not sure if they were made for people who workout though.Other than that, i am pleased with my purchase.",4,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"I ordered these noise cancelling headphones out of necessity during the coronavirus quarantines. I live with my boyfriend in a one bedroom apartment, and each of our in-person grad school programs have been converted to virtual classes. We became enemies after being forced to listen to each other’s classes constantly while trapped in 600 sq feet. I ordered us each a pair of these headphones because I didn’t want to spend too much, as we usually rely on our AirPods.These do the job. They’re not totally noise cancelling, but we can each listen to our lectures without hearing each other in the background. The Bluetooth easily connected to my Mac with little effort, these headphones are really user friendly.",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"I love how easy this product is to connect and turn on. Specifically, it features both a Bluetooth and noise canceling mode so I can choose whichever is appropriate. I’m no major audiophile, but the sound is great. I can tell they’re better than any other set I own. The battery life is also amazing. I used it daily (almost two weeks now) and have not had to charge it. Lastly is the fit. They are very comfortable on my ears, but the headband sticks out a little further than I would like aesthetically. I couldn’t justify knocking a star off for that however as that’s just me. Great purchase overall, and I finally found the over the ear noise cancelling headphones that I really can enjoy.",5,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"I'm not really an audiophile, but I wanted Bluetooth headphones for the 3hrs or so a week I spend on my riding mower, and these have worked well for me.Bluetooth connects easily once it's paired, just turn it on. Sound quality is good, but not as loud as I am use to, but loud enough.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
I use these at work or at home when I am studying. They are the only pair I have ever owned so not sure if maybe my expectations are too high but the noise cancelling isn’t the greatest. You can still hear everything going on around you. My ears hurt after wearing them for a bit and have to take them off for a few minutes. The Bluetooth works well and when I’m listening to music as low as it goes (I wish it went lower bc it’s quietist isn’t that quiet) I can’t hear anything else around me so the noise cancelling works great then. For what you pay though I’d say these are an excellent buy. I’ve never had the expensive kind though so not sure if they cancel noise any better when not listening to music and I don’t know if my ears are just sensitive and any pair would hurt after a while. The battery definitely lasts a long time as I hardly every charge them and I use them every day.,3,1,2019-4-20,1,0,0
"Way better than I expected for the price. I have been somewhat of an audiophile for the last 70 years and I did not expect the sound quality. Very good, smooth, easily listenable for a long period. Match my Sennheiser HD600?? No way. But the HD600 cost almost $400 and just has a 10 ft cord to connect. This has BT, and a stereo cord to connect and both work really well. I can listen to streaming music and wander around doing things or sit and watch streaming video with great sound. A tad full in bass and a bit down on top but still very smooth and listenable.Now. VERY comfortable. A little heavy but so well designed and padded that they are still very comfy. The ear pads are so soft and comfortable.  the controls could be a bit more intuitive but they work okay. I have NOT tried the noise cancelling so no comment on that. I don't know if I'll ebver use that part. I have others if I want NC and they work.",5,1,2017-10-21,1,0,0
I hate giving bad reviews so to have to do this I am pretty disappointed. I won't lie to you. For 60$ it is NOT worth it. You can get a pair of headphones from the thrift store or marshalls or even best buy like skull candy and get the same if not better and LOUDER sound quality. These are NOT noise cancelling. Unless you stay completely still these have a crackling sound that you can hear over your music/audio playing. The bass is not booming. There are vibrations that give the illusion that there is bass but there is no real sound quality that gives you that WOW factor. Also these are NOT loud at all. They are about the same as airpods or regular headphones you can get anywhere. To be honest these were a bit cheaper than the Sony's I was about to buy and the reviews were great so I went with them but I will pay a bit more for the Sony's because I have never been disappointed with Sony's audio. Just add a bit of audio protection and you are good to go. I would not recommend these. I am sorry for the bad review.,1,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
New info added Sept. 2017.I just got back from almost a month in Africa. I used these earphones on the airplane and with my iPhone. I worked them hard...tossed them in my carry on bag when traveling...they didn't get much TLC. But they continued to work and still work. I love the noise canceling feature on the air plane. One charge of the battery took me through the longest leg (10 hours) of my journey. I used a long audio cord with an airplane adapter to watch movies. Sound was much better than that provided by the airline supplied earbuds. Based on my experience I highly recommend the Cowin E7.,5,1,2017-6-21,1,2,0
"These are nice noise-canceling headphones for the price. I have only had them for a few days, but overall I would say that the sound is very good, even on low volume, but the noise-cancelling feature is okay; ambient noise is significantly reduced, but not totally eliminated. My biggest complaint is the ridiculous charging cord, which is barely long enough to reach from a side table to the outlet directly behind it. The wire between plugs is roughly 26” long. I would prefer to pay an extra dollar or two for a cord that is four to six feet long.",4,1,2018-11-30,1,1,0
"At the time I purchased these headphones in March 2018 for the full price of $70.00, I was VERY happy with them. The sound, the quality at the time of purchase, the comfort of the ear pads, the overall experience was quite satisfying. I am an adult with no children to fool around with my belongings, & I take great care of products like this seriously, like DO NOT TOUCH MY THINGS! Soooo, 10 months into using these Cowin earphones almost daily, I picked them up one day & they simply broke, as in this photo. It seems the wire connections were about to fall apart from the head piece. I was devastated, because I DO take care of my things, putting them away in the provided pouch, etc. I immediately took a photo of this & sent it to COWIN, explaining this. They have an 18 month warrantee on the them. Well let me tell YOU. They have EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. They sent me an email the very next day saying they would replace them right away & I did not have to send the broken ones back. I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase, regardless, because of THEIR QUALITY SERVICE. I am expecting them tomorrow & can't WAIT! Please keep in mind of this review, to go ahead & buy this product from COWIN. Any other seller will not give you this kind of warrantee that COWIN itself WILL. Also, I did not have to buy extra protection. HAPPY CAMPER!",5,1,2018-4-2,1,0,1
"UPDATE TO MY UPDATE!!!Forget everything I said. While the first unit I had did stop working, this company stands behind their products and has some of the best customer service I’ve ever experienced!  Something that’s quite remarkable today and it’s certainly appreciated!!  They sent me a new pair of the headphones and once again they work great and I’m a happy camper who can block out the unwanted sounds of screaming children or leaf blowers as I listen to music or audio books whether I’m on a flight or in my backyard!  Thanks Cowin!!  Highly recommended and my review goes back to a solid 5 stars!!",5,1,2018-5-9,1,0,0
"These aren't outstanding by any means but I use them for the gym mostly. The sound quality is average, bass is pretty good. The noise cancelling doesn't do too much and it does kill the bass a bit but it does get you a cleaner sound if you are using them for something other than music, such as watching netflix while others are having conversations. I noticed the NC worked best when I was heading to a wedding in the car with my family. It took away the road noise. At the gym I usually keep the NC off though for the slightly better bass quality. They're fairly comfortable, no issues there, I can wear them for over an hour with no ear pain or discomfort. Overall happy with them.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"I just got these & I like how they sound.  It's the priciest bluettoth headset I've owned, so that makes sense.  The ear cushioning is comfortable.  They came with a USB Cord + an Audio Cord & a carrying bag (which I see little use for, but that's just me.I did carelessly lean backward while they were on & they fell off on to my ceramic tile floor.  Much to my pleasant surprise, they sounded fine & I didn't feel or hear anything rattling or loose on it.  So I put them back on & did the same exact thing again.  Same non-harmful result.  Hopefully I won't be clumsy/careless enough to do it again.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"Did I receive a bad unit?  When I turn on it on to NC mode, there's a constant vibration on the left ear.  Sometime if I reposition the ear cuff, it would go away, but it's a hit and miss.  When it happens, it very annoying.  The vibration even occurred during music playing.Besides this issue, which I believe to only me.  The sound is very good.  I am comparing this to a Sony X1000M2 and the sound on this unit is very close with the Sony.  This unit has a bit less treble and a bit heavy bass.  The Sony sound is more natural. This unit is a bit harsh.  But for the price, this unit can't be beaten.",3,1,2019-6-1,1,1,0
"Alright, beautiful look and comforting fit DOES NOT excuse it quality wise. My Playstation's headset has better sound quality than these, the stereo sounds like something is blocking it like a hand, with high volume behind it and NO I don't have a defective model(just using a small example). It's just not as great as the reviews I was reading about it made it seem, I had HIGH expectations so I'm now disappointed in its outcome. This headset has absolutely RUINED my ""built in Mic"" headset experience, first hooking it up, the volume for the mic is SOOO LOW the pc could barely pick it up and my friends listening on the other end can't stand hearing me through it. This hands free mode bs has angered me to the point where I'm no longer buying built in microphone headsets, it ruins the sound quality of your pc's audio to boost the call/voice chat volume. It's entirely irritating, plus I don't know how to connect the headset via aux cable. normally with other products all i'd do is plug it in(while its connected to the headphones) using the aux chord & model BUT that does NOT work with this headset so, WHY IS THERE AN AUX CABLE?? Maybe I have to read the guide again, but all together I give it a two star, its not something too special to buy yourself if you're a producer like me looking for good quality headphones with a clear precise microphone for voice chats. I'll just use em for my phone, but other than that. I doubt it'll be helpful otherwise. Enjoy with caution.",2,1,2017-11-9,1,3,0
"Amazing! They block out sound so good! My boyfriend borrowed them and decided to walk to work. He said they blocked out the sound of the busy street he walked down, and the sound quality was amazing. They also have great customer service. I broke the first pair because I'm clumsy, and they honored the warranty and were super kind about it. These headphones work better than my beats to be honest.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"very pleased with purchase although price kind of high.  I use a lot - in grocery store, at home, etc.  I like that I can talk on phone.  only thing I'd say is that there are these weird shaped plastic things on both sides of the ear pieces.  I have no idea what they are for.  I'm too busy to slow down and figure it out.  I think I can end a phone call with it.  only one works the other I think is aesthetics to keep the design balanced.  You won't be disappointed.  Great quality.  Kind of big.  I'm okay with that.  tremendous sound.  I go around in the grocery store with them on singing out loud to what I'm hearing - get a few looks but doesn't bother me.  Life it too short, right?  Take care and hope you and yours are safe from the COVID-19.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"update: The company reached out to me and helped me a lot. They offered to send me another unit which is working. The customer service is great! I would definitely order another model if they didn’t replace them for me.I ordered these because I couldn't stand the thought of paying over $200 for a great pair. These aren't too bad, but I was hoping that they were a little better than they were. The fit and finish is nice, and they are comfortable on my head. Others stated that they were really loud, but to me, they don't get too loud. The bass isn't bad at all. My main complaint is the volume button. Mine does't work and I have to use the buttons on my phone or mac. I will be returning them and try a different brand.",4,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0

"I purchased these sound cancelling headphones for my wife's birthday. She loves them! They're obviously not quite as good as bose or sony ones. But I'd say they're 80% as good, for only 30% the price! Hard to pass up that deal. We travel often and they have made a huge difference for her when flying. She used to get bad ear aches when flying, but wearing these has really helped. They are comfortable and sound pretty good. I tried them a few times and my only wish was that the max volume was a little louder, but maybe that's just because I'm used to blasting music in my ears with non-noisecancelling headphones...",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"I bought these for my husband who is a perpetual sports TV enthusiast. As he is hard of hearing, the blare of the crowd sometimes brings me to feel that I am actually in the ballfield. (When I start smelling beer and hotdogs I'll let you know!) Anyway, these headphones are a lifesaver (marriage-saver??). Not only are they economical, but they perform as advertised. I have experimented with them, and the sound quality and noise cancellation are great: Enough that I cannot blame selective hearing! They are comfortable as well (Maybe I should get a pair to noise cancel snoring!)As a side note, we had to purchase a bluetooth adapter so they would work, but that was no big deal. I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone not wanting to pay and arm and a leg & maybe two ears for more expensive bluetooth headphones. Quality is not compromised with the price.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,1,0
"I got these headphones to wear outside while walking and listening to my iPod.  I wanted the bluetooth and the pause plus sound control features, all of which work wonderfully well.  It is solidly constructed and looks and feels like an expensive product.  The headphones are adjustable and fit nicely on my head with a padded ban and over the ears.  They allow very little road noise when I am wearing them outside and the sound quality is great.  Th only caveat I have is that they are heavy and as such bother my neck when walking at a fast clip.  That is the reason for the 4 star rating.  I do not have a problem with them using them anywhere in the house.  So far, the battery life is good, but I tend to recharge before I think it is getting close to running out.  I would not recommend these headphones if you want to use them with exercising, but would otherwise recommend them.",4,1,2017-2-27,1,1,0
"These things are so light and comfy, it feels like a pillow embracing your head. Its pretty awesome. The noise canceling is alright. With noise canceling on, but no input, it does things like mute the toilet and stair creaks, and that super annoying noise when you chew with headphones on. There is a faint white-noise sound coming from the left headphone that I cant hear in the right headphone. With music playing, it loses all its bass, and cranks the treble to 11, so that is annoying. Watching a movie, it made the voices easy to hear over the music, but completely destroyed the soundtrack.With noise canceling off, I couldn't tell the difference between these Ear-Pillows and my my $10 Sentry earbuds, the bass returned, the treble seemed normal. The only noticeable difference was comfort.",3,1,2018-6-20,1,1,0
"Great for the money, but...felt like joining the review team here, to help out future buyers.  Maybe.  Sound quality being top-priority here, and they are a solid 4.  A little bottom ""heavy"" for me, but overall sound quality is very good.  the PAWW wavesound3 at $99 was my better option, but ONLY if you want to spend the extra $30.  They are very close in weight, NC, sound, etc.  The bass can always be EQ'd out by any iPhone, android, sound gadget.  Under $75 you won't find better Bluetooth headphones.  Period.  And don't compare with $300-$500 pro audio anything, because this analysis fails to make engineering sense.  If you budget is under $75, this are a five-star choice...maybe buy two for $140.  Hey seller, sell these two-for-discount price!  Or, push your budget and go for the PAWW.  No need to spend 3x.  Noise cancellation on four hour flight was perfect.  (PS, if you are trying to use NC to mute out random noises like kids yelling in the background, etc...none are good for that)",4,1,2018-1-18,1,0,0
"I listen to music while working to avoid the distraction of conversations between coworkers. I've been using a Jabra wired open air headphone that doubles for Zoom meetings and it sounded pretty good. I wanted to go wireless to avoid the ""dog at the end of his tether"" phenom when I get up. I've tried various wireless buds (the best being Sony Extra Bass Bluetooth headphones) but they all are uncomfortable after an hour or two plus that's about how long the battery charge lasts. I just got the Cowin E7's yesterday and I'm blown away by the excellent sound of the music through these phones. Even before playing music through them, the over-ear design and noise cancellation knocks down the surrounding chatter to less than a third. They also maintain their charge for 30 hours! I highly recommend these.",5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"I've been looking for a while now for a pair of headphones that I could wear while mowing and weed eating while still wearing my hearing aide. These  work great! It took seconds to sync up with my iPnone, the music quality and phone capabilities are very good as well. I'm deaf in one ear and I'm trying to protect the hearing I have in my good ear. They do a great job of  reducing the noise of the mower and trimmer, can you still hear them? Yes, albeit at a level that I can tolerate and still hear my music or book very clearly. I'm actually very surprised at the quality, comfort, long battery life and cost. I've been getting right at 30 hours of listening per charge. My wife was so impressed that the day mine arrived I had to get her a set as well! Thanks Cowin for a great product at a great price!",5,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
"Update: lasted two years of light office use and broke at one of the pivot points. Pretty bummed because they worked well for how I used them. I prefer my stuff last longer so I will probably invest in something a little more substantial for it's replacement.I tried on at least a dozen active noise cancelling headphones at a store near me but decided to try these because they were significantly less expensive and had good reviews. I have been wearing them at work to try and reduce the HVAC noise. They are very comfortable to wear all day. The sound is great (to me - for the way I use them). The active noise canceling is the least intrusive of all the pairs I have tried. It blocks out all the low constant noises, it does not however block out the buzz I was hoping to block. I guess its a trade off because they don't make me feel like I am 10 feet under water when the active cancelling is on like other popular pairs. The Bluetooth has been quick and flawless with my Windows 10 pcs and Windows phone. The mic seems to be the big week spot. I have only tried it on a couple calls so far an no one could hear me well enough to use it. Maybe I need to mess with  more settings on the device.",3,1,2017-11-28,1,1,0

"The sound on these seem to be right on the mark. I use both the bluetooth and the wired option and the sound seems pretty solid on both.

"The sound quality is actually pretty good, especially for the price, and setting them up couldn't be more simple. These headphones do have that going for them.Unfortunately, the interface is ridiculously tricky and a bit of a hassle. It takes a bit getting used to,  other than the audio, the controls are all over the place, and at times it would be really frustrating. I mean, I've never had any issue with technology or any other headphone, but sometimes it would take me longer than it should have just to get them to turn on.

"Fantastic headphones! Great noise canceling technology and perfect sound quality! The bass drivers are insane: you can FEEL THE MUSIC!I was afraid—because of my huge head—that these wouldn’t work well for me; however, fully extended the headphones fit very comfortably and are so lightweight I hardly notice them. The ear cups for me rest more ON the ear instead of OVER/AROUND the ear, but this could just be because of my big head/ears. Either way, the (faux?) leather is amazingly soft so it’s  not an issue.",5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
UPDATE - JULY 17 - Since I posted this review I want to update my review. The seller was great in working with me on the fit and feel.  I got another pair and they seem to adjust better then the first pair so maybe they made a slight design change. Either way they are more comfortable than the first pair.Not bad.  I was looking for an inexpensive but nice sounding wireless headphone and these are just that  I use them with my Ipod when I'm mowing the lawn or just somewhere where having a cord is bothersome.  I was really hoping I would use these during workouts but no way.  They aren't very comfortable if you need to adjust them to a tighter fit - they hurt my ears - and once you start sweating they start slipping.  The sound is not terrible but probably not as good as a $50 pair of earbuds. The noise cancelation is really good and they get good use on the airplane. If I were to give them as a gift it would be with the knowledge that there was a 50/50 chance they would get returned.,4,1,2017-7-14,1,1,0
"I really wanted to like these headphones. They feel good around your head and are a good weight to carry around.

"Now obviously if you buy a pair of noise cancelling headphones for a lot more they will be of better quality. But the flights I have been and will be taking for a while are only about an hour long so I couldn't justify spending that much. Found these bad boys and for the price, these are AMAZING. They are super comfy and cancel out any noises and the sound quality (both with music and Netflix) is phenomenal. I'd definitely buy these and save some money any day.EDIT: Still great but I took a flight recently and was at the very back of the plane. In no way do these cancel out the noises of an engine. But I don't think any headphones would.",5,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"As a headphone, I guess this is just fine. I am not an audiophile, so I cannot speak to clarity at every wavelength, but these phones sound OK to an unsophisticated listener like me. I have not tried the noise cancelling feature, so I cannot speak to that either.What I can say is that when I make a Skype call on this headset, my voice sounds like I am in an echo chamber. So, for calls, I am going to have to go back to using my KOTION B3505 Wireless phones. Maybe, I am not using them correctly? Perhaps I had the NC on and that distorted the sound. If I can get this worked out, I will update my review. For now, I am only giving it 3 stars because of the voice quality on phone calls. I should add that the people I call sound fine. Maybe the seller can address this issue and something I may be doing wrong?",3,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

(Hey, that's why the music's loud, right?) I think I might actually hear the upper mids a bit better with the headphones. Bass is okay, not floor rattling of course, but good for cans.

Yes, you will not hear the screaming baby right behind you but your neighbors will hear your music loud & clear (added to a screaming kid, well, you get the idea that it wouldn’t be a good situation).

"These headphones are great. I am not an audiophile and I often feel that reviews touting highs, lows and midranges are all a lot of fluff. The sound quality is very good. More importantly I no longer have to continuously reposition the headphones back in my ear. I use them to walk the dog although this may not be so conducive to the warmer nights once summer arrives. They also work very well when doing chores around the house. They allow me to listen to music really loud without annoying everyone else in the house. I have been wearing them this spring when mowing on the riding lawn mower. I do not think that it will be too hot to continue this practice throughout the summer. The range is good approximately 30 feet. When mowing I put my phone in the pocket of my cargo shorts to maintain a close proximity to the headphones.

The noise cancellation is not exactly what I expected, but I don't have much to compare it to. Certainly not the same quality as a $300 pair of headphones, but they are a great product for the price. I just wanted something nice over the ear to play music while I work and these are effective at drowning out enough noise to keep me focused. They are very comfortable and look great. The call quality on the bluetooth is hit or miss. Sometimes people say they can hear me very clearly and other times they say it sounds like I'm underwater.

"These headphones work beautifully for listening to music. For the price, the sound quality is excellent (to my untrained ears) and the noise cancellation really works. They're also very comfortable to wear and easy to set-up, connecting via Bluetooth to my computer and phone with ease. My lone complaint about the headphones is that the microphone audio quality isn't great. I got these headphones for the primary purpose of being able to use them for zoom calls and the like, but the mic sound is a little thin, distant and low volume, so I gave up on using them for that purpose almost immediately-- people couldn't always hear me clearly and when I tested them for myself, recording audio via the headphones, I could hear the problems they were reporting . The fact that I decided to keep them is a testament to their quality as headphones and their relative low price, but I was very close to returning them. If you're looking for quality, bluetooth, noise cancelling headphones, and that's all you need them for, I'd definitely recommend.

When I swith to the NC, IMO I notice the sound quality drop a small amount but don't notice a reduction in outside noise. The construction/design muffles out a good amount of noise naturally, which is nice, but I feel there was just nothing to say is actively reducing outside noise more than the material. Since I have 5 kids at home in the middle of this current medical situation, it leaves me wishing for more. I wish I tried the newer model out instead.",4,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0

Maybe I got a lemon, but they only seem to work if you are actively listening to music at the same time from your laptop, and they still don't block out the noise very efficiently. More importantly the battery life is also really short. When in use with music, they seem to only last  5 hours- but if you charge them and take them off of the charger and bring them anywhere to help with the sound, they won't remain charged.

Noise is reduced in both positions, but I can't say that I hear the effect of active cancellation like I do with my 3M Work Tunes.

"These headphones started out great, but started acting up after about 2-weeks of use.  I bought them to listen to my online classes during the lock down.  I have a set of bone conducting headphones that I use as well and the poor connection only shows up in these headphones.  The sound quality is terrific and I really wanted to like them after the way they started out.  Once the connection settles in, they work great and are very comfortable, just which the Bluetooth connection worked better.  Maybe I just got a lemon...<<<UPDATE July 29,2020>>>",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Thiacwas my first experience with headphones.  I read all the reviews before I purchased these going on their recommendations and they were spot on.  These are very user friendly, even I can use them.  If your on the fence, I strongly recommend the e7.  They are comfortable and user friendly.  Good purchase.  I just ordered my husband a set.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,2,0
"I work in an open office, and word just came down that they're moving the cubes closer together so I opted to finally cave and buy noise canceling headphones.  These Cowin E7s are even better than I expected.  The noise canceling does a great job letting me concentrate even if I'm not listening to any music.  And when I am listening to music, it's like I'm in my own isolated world - people need to tap me on the shoulder if they want to talk with me.The only downside of these headphones is that the wired audio connection isn't great.  There's lots of static if you move the wire and the sound isn't great anyway.  Fortunately, the bluetooth is amazing.  Between the high quality digital sound and a noise canceling feature, these things have really blown me away.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
Maybe I was expecting too much. I’ve never owned a pair of noise cancelling headphones before.My wife bought these for me for Fathers Day. She knew I was wanting a set of noise cancelling headphones.,3,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
I'll start with the positives: The ear cups are very comfortable and the sound is good when it's working.Now for the negative: The sound crackles pretty frequently and I have to restart the audio or the headphones. I have to restart OVER AND OVER. It's a pain in the ass. I've looked at the troubleshooting book and it's lacking. The crackling happens regardless of my head position or whether or not I'm moving.,2,1,2020-7-31,1,1,0
My husband and I used them on a recent flight. The sound quality is good not great. I’ve had some amazing ones primarily for music that were better but for videos and stuff they are really good. Not sure about sound canceling ability. Your ears are covered so it definitely helped to drown out the engine noise but it’s still there. It improved our flight experience with paying 4x the price for trendy brand name headphones. They don’t keep falling off like the basic cheap ones you stick in your ear so that was great. I didn’t use the Bluetooth capability on the plane so not sure about that.,4,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"I order one pair and had to send the first was back after some sound issues during playback. The replacement pair have worked fine for me with a couple exceptions. I think they are very good durable headphones, there is comfort but they can feel a little tight on my ears sometimes . Nothing too bad to ruin the experience the sound is good for the price. After using beat headphones I wanted something with good noise canceling solutions but affordable. These fir that qualification they  have great sound, drown out most of the noise, and do not cost a lot. Bonus costumer service is friendly and great. I definitely recommend.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"Ordered a cheap pair of $20 headphones for my daughter and she complained from the moment she tried them of how uncomfortable they were on her ears. We returned those and ordered this pair.She LOVES them, super comfy and stellar noise cancellation. She'll be heading off to college so wanted to make sure they worked with her new macbook. No problems pairing whatsover. Very pleased with this pair of headphones and I'm sure she'll get tons of use out of them. They hold a charge very well. She charges them overnight but not because they need it/ran out of juice, simply because it was convenient.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I bought these originally to replace my old USB headset that I used for gaming and also now intended to use while working. To begin I'd say that the actual audio quality is amazing for the price, as is the battery life. I like the noise cancelling feature and enjoy sometimes just wearing them while I work for that feature. I've never had noise-cancelling headphones before so I don't know how they compare to others. I can still hear some sounds in the background but they are greatly muffled.The major con is the microphone. I used this headset on multiple devices with different individuals and in all each case people had great difficulty hearing me. I tested the headset in Discord and saw that the microphone had a really hard time detecting my voice and so all my words came out clipped. The microphone quality is so poor that I had to flip back to using the onboard microphone on my work computer and ended up getting a more expensive, higher quality Bluetooth headset for my gaming needs.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"These headphones are great given the price.  I actually got them on an Amazon deal so they were even more affordable.  They have active noise cancelling and great sound when you put them on.  They have deep bass sound. So, they are good for songs with that characteristic.  The blue tooth pairs really easy.For the price, I would recommend these compared to much more expensive ones.",4,1,2018-4-11,1,0,0
"Over the past few years, I went through several headphones and I learned a few things.  If a headset is made of the same plastic material that toys are made of, they are going to break like toys.  I actually spent more money in total buying serial self-destructing headphones than the price of buying a quality headphone that comes with a guaranty.  What I didn't expect was that the quality of the sound was better, the noise control was better, and customer support came with it.  I don't write reviews too often but I finally found the headset I've been looking for and decided to shout it from the roof tops.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones when I learned I was going to be working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. I knew I would need to focus and work while also in the same room as my kids for an extended period of time.  I love that I can use the noise-canceling option by itself, or while listening to music/my audio books.  It is also perfect for my conference calls.  I can focus on the call and not be distracted by what else is going on in my house, especially while my kids are doing all of their Zoom calls for school and gymnastics workouts.  These headphones have been perfect for this crazy situation and I plan to continue to use them at the office (where I work in a ""cube farm"") to help keep me focused.  They are comfortable to wear and fit well.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"The C7 headphones are so light, comfortable and bling.  It paired very easily to my Android phone.  I like the controls on the right side cup that allow for volume, pause and skip back and forth while playing media and allows one button call answering.  I have my office phone forwarded to my cell.  When a call comes in, my media stops and I push the one button to answer.  I can hear the calls fine and the caller can hear me fine as well.  Put these headphones on  and switch from off to BT and then to ANC and the sound magically deadens.  When I leave my office and hit the noisy street, I don't have to raise the volume while using ANC like I would with earbuds.  Big difference.  I can see these being useful while snow blowing (ugh), mowing the lawn and just working outside.  Corded earbuds can't block out the noise and  I am always getting the cord caught somewhere and pulling them out of my ear.  Earbuds just can't overcome the noise of power equipment (my experience).  I should have been using these all my life.  The sound is a bit boomy sans ANC but using ANC plus volume you get decent sound.Price to Quality score is a 10.",4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"Great price, excellent sound, comfortable, wonderful value. Range is amazing. Pairing is super simple.If I had to nitpick, the Noise Cancellation isn't perfect, but for the price point, there really aren't any other options.

"I bought these so I could study while in my open study and not have to banish anyone from watching tv in the living room. I really like these. The are a solid product. The noise cancellation is not 100%, but very sufficient. The bluetooth allows me to run to the kitchen and get a snack and not miss a beat of my music or my school cohort. The packaging is quality, as it comes in a good box with a carrying pouch and wire, if needed. Truth? Sometimes I wear them without listening to music just to have a few moments of solitude. I would highly recommend this product. They are worth the price.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I bought these after trying a friends pair of noise cancelling headphones on a flight.  It's incredible what they can do with the loud sound of the airplane.  Also helps with the HVAC at work when its loud.  The sound quality is much better than other $30 OTE headphones I own (not noise cancelling though), and the noise cancelling works.  It's not as good of noise cancelling as nicer pairs but for the price these are worth it.  They connect easily to all my devices, I've been wearing them around the office for a week now.  They also look great and have a nice build quality compared to my $30 pair.  I recommend these if you want a pair of noise cancelling headphones for an airplane or other noisy environment.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"I wanted a set of Bluetooth over the ear for comfort and these fit the bill. Don't know about the noise cancelling yet. They sound great and look good to boot and are easily paired. The only thing I will have to get used to is turning the switch to off. I have already forgotten and they went dead overnight. Funny thing though they cannot be used wired unless fully charged.02.26.20I have been using for awhile and don't really get how the batteries or battery need to be charged even when not being used. They go dead from just sitting (switch off). I don't use daily and the constant charging will shorten their life. I don't expect them to last long, I'll see",3,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
"Mostly got for listening to music and YouTube, they have great sound quality for that. The ear cups are huge, insanely huge to the point i have to leave one off and normally tucked behind my ear so I can still hear what's going on around me, but they're so big that's nearly impossible. But terrible for phone calls, which is half the reason i use headphones for. Wife says she hears me fine on them, other people have told me they can hear me but it's muffled. On my end I can only hear the faintest of a whisper, which in a diesel truck even with the noise cancellation option might as well be nothing. I've gone through every setting on my phone including connecting and disconnecting, searched online for anything about them and came up blank. Maybe mine are manufacturer defect, I dunno. Honestly my $20 Walmart cheapies worked better for my needs before they quit working. The sound for music is a 5+, calls not even a 1 star.",2,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I liked the overall audio on this item as well as the headset's ability to easily and repeatedly pair and the battery life.  I very much disliked the controls.  The volume controls are on a very small triangular chrome plate on the outside of the headset.  When turned on the volume is high and  not what at the volume it was previously used, and there is no way to preset it.  The volume control is almost impossible to control when the headset is on because you can't really feel the tiny bumps that represent +/-.Follow up to my initial review:  The control issue I described is because if my dexterity problems with this type of control.  I am elderly just wanted them for my TV.  After reading my review Customer service reached out to me and offered multiple options including full refund.  Because of this outstanding customer service and the  update to my review I have updated my rating.",5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0

"I wanted some over ear headphones to go back and forth between my earbuds because I don't always want something in my ears. I have hardly even used my earbuds since! These are so nice for the modest price! They sound great, and are quite comfortable. I like that the noise cancelling is optional, because the noise cancelling function on all headphones hurts my ears. They feel pretty sturdy and they've held up very well for the short time I've had them (I have a history of being tough on my electronic equipment). The battery life is also very impressive! I've been spending too much time on the couch with everything going on, but these have never run out of battery. To be honest, I really wanted a pair from a well known name brand, but they were at least $70 more expensive. I'm so glad I went with these, I'm very pleased!",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"I recently went on vacation and the longest plane ride of my life. I wanted some noise cancelling headphones without paying $300 for Bose ones. These so far have exceeded my expectations! They feel nice on your head. You can tell a major difference from just the regular setting and the noise cancelling setting. I’m very sensitive to sound especially on airplanes. I could still hear louder sounds, but that’s good for when the pilot was talking and what not. These muffled the engine noise and people around me. The sound quality seems great to me. Easy to use and travel with. I charged them once before I left and still had battery life after two 8 hour flights. Then two 1 1/2 hours flights! Super impressed with these all around!",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0

"These are the best over ear noise cancelling headphones that I own for under a hundred bucks. They're pretty bulky, but still comfortable to wear for long periods.  We have three people working from home right now, with all three of us on video calls at the same time.  My wife and I both have E7s, and it does a lot to keep the streams separated in the home office environment.Also nice when I just want to chill out and get away from everybody.  I can listen to some white noise on spotify while the kids or wife are watching TV.  I'm still in the room but I'm not longer distracted.  The NC isn't perfect...you'll still get some noise coming through, but significantly diminished.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I bought these at the same time as a pair of Bludio T4 headphones, which disappointed me. I just did a long trip with these Cowin E-7s and was pretty happy with them. The earpads were comfortable and only got a little warm after a long wearing period, which is totally normal. I also really liked that these have a physical switch to move between off/passive mode, Bluetooth audio mode, and active noise cancelling (see comment below.)I couldn't really tell what codecs were being employed, but these paired easily with both my Samsung Galaxy S8+ and my NVidia Shield K1 tablet and had no audio lag when watching video.When in use, the active noise cancellation was quite effective. The only surprise (and maybe this is normal) is that the active noise cancelling mode only works when the headphones are receiving audio from a source via Bluetooth, but not when physically plugged into an audio source.It wasn't a huge problem because these were easily able to overcome the noise on board an airplane.",4,1,2017-6-25,1,0,0
"Day two with Cowin E7. I meant to order the Pro but I'm just not that picky and put trust into these guys. Mostly because the reviews.First time buying headphones in two years. I had a pair of Nubwo with mic that I paid $20 for and they would just not quit. I am not an audiophile by any means. However I have tried out so many different companies of headphones, I was so overwhelmed when I got on Amazon and started searching for the next set. So many companies with so many mixed reviews, I gave up and asked myself..what do I really need? What am I really looking for? Price range was between $50-$150. I had no idea, until I read a review on these headphones that made me realize what it was I needed. This guy was searching for weeks, same as I did, he was beyond overwhelmed just like I was. I realized I didn't need anything to crazy or flashy. Just a decent pair of headphones that would keep me locked into the games I'm playing on PS4. I really don't even play that much but time is precious and if I'm going to spend any amount of time playing videogames I need to be in the game. I don't need to chat with people, I need to be locked in. I also realized it would be refreshing to order from a company that truly cares and appreciates their customers. I didn't know I needed that until I started scrolling through the reviews of the E7 I realized that most of the reviews, even the bad, had so much praise about their customer service I had to go back and make sure I was reading them properly. Customer satisfaction is almost a myth these days because technology has spoiled so many people even the smallest issue can leave a negative review. This company has your back. Yes this is only day two but guess what? If something happens, these guys will make it right. I wanted to just see for myself so I sent an email to Cowin, I had a legitimate question about upgrading to their E7 Pro. They replied back to me in an hour maybe two tops. I couldn't believe it. It's something you have to experience yourself.",4,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
I have been looking for decent bluetooth headphones with noise canceling capabilities but was put off by the high cost of Bose and Sony. I took a chance on the much cheaper Cowin E7 and have been pleasantly surprised. The headphones feel sturdy and well made. They have been easy to connect to a variety of devices. They are comfortable even with extended use (4 or 5 hrs at a time). The sound quality is pretty good though it seems to favor the low end rather than the high end. The noise canceling capability is also pretty good. It isn't quite as good as a Bose but at a fifth of the price you get a lot for your money. I have only had them a few weeks so I can't attest to their long term durability. For those on a budget I would definitely recommend the Cowin E7.,4,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
I really wanted to like these. My son has ASD and has wanted a pair of noise cancelling head phones for a long time.  I bought these as a Christmas gift. The noise cancelling was definitely not worth it but they're so snug that he still found a benefit.Fast forward 6 months and the headphones will not even turn on although they appear to be fully powered. Several online articles point to the battery which conveniently can not be accessed or replaced without breaking the headphones.,2,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"I’ve had these for a year now. Perfect for listening to my tv when everyone is asleep in my small house. I get to listen to Sunday morning news while everyone sleeps. Sound quality for tv news is great. I can work in the kitchen and still listen to tv news. The only issue is standing next to my turned on microwave. A little choppy, but only when I’m microwaving (lol!). Range is about 20-30’ from my one transmitter. I’d buy it again.",5,1,2019-6-11,1,1,0
"1. Appearance- The overall design is pretty simple. I thought that it would be a heavier material but the headphones are a thicker plastic? However, as someone who prefers a simpler design this was fine for me.2. sound quality- Sound quality is on par. I have hi-fi streaming so I was looking for a pair of headphones that would be compatible, and I'm not disappointed at all. The only concern is that the volume doesn't seem to work independently from my device so it doesn't get as loud as I would like, mostly just a a little bit higher than conversational volume. Not sure if it's just my pair but I would have liked for that option to have been available.",4,1,2018-3-28,1,0,0
"These have become my go-to commuting/ public work space headphones! The noise cancellation (NC) is fantastic. NC is typically built to drown out the deep low-end rumble of airplanes but it works pretty well in noisy public places such as coffee shops and trains to help drown out distracting background noise and keep you focused.The sound quality is fantastic for this price point, especially when NC is turned on. The bass is not boomey or muddy and it gives you just the perfect amount of vibration in the headphones to make it enjoyable. The highs are nice and crisp but not overly sibilant which gives you a nice clean listening experience when combined with the ""NC Bass"" as I like to call it.",4,1,2019-4-16,1,1,0
"As headphones the sound it pretty good quality.  The plastic seems cheap.  I don't notice a difference between regular (BT) and noise cancellation (NC) modes.  The microphone is absolute garbage and unusable as a headset, which was the main reason I bought it.  No one can understand you when you speak.  It sounds like a bunch of jumbled high pitched sounds if you speak.",2,1,2020-8-13,1,1,0
"Absolutely amazing. I did follow the instructions and powered the batteries for 8 long hours. Then I tried the bluetooth feature off my iPhone 6 plus iTunes. What a treat!! I could not hear the TV set and was able to leave the iPhone in the great room as I went by the dining room and into the kitchen to get something to eat. No problem; the headphones continued what they were playing without pause. I also worked with the equalizer on my phone which is usually set at bass booster. I tried treble booster, small speakers, and loudness. The headphones responded to all of them with the changes one is supposed to get. I am planning to take these on plane rides which now drive me around the bend. I think they will be and are ideal. I do not think you could ask for anything more--unsurpassed listening to iTunes.",5,1,2017-8-28,1,1,0
"So let's start out positive. These headphones are great. I keep getting yelled at because I'm not responding and I still can't hear them. So yeah the noise cancellation is great. The bass is good too, sometimes too good where it's crazy loud. Now this is where the problems start. The sound quality is good but when I'm on a walk, if I move downwards too much, the audio spazzes out for a quick second and everything is fine again, nothing too serious but it's still annoying. Now for the audio controls on the headphones. It's so hard to get them to work right, it's better to just use your phone/speaker/computer's volume buttons. And the ""Skip"" button is too sensitive, sometime's I'll just be laying down and it skips a song I like. Now for my biggest problem with these headphones. My god do they make my ears sweat. Like it's insane how much sweat they cause when I'm on a walk, it's just a constant build up and it makes me feel even hotter than i already am from the sweat on my head. Really I could have earbuds which would solve this but they don't come with noise canceling which is really nice. Good product just a few flaws.",4,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"For the price very good sound quality.  Functionality is pretty good.  Would buy again if needed, hopefully not.Some minor issues:  when power is low and in noise cancelling mode it begins to have low thumping noise.

Of course, the only difference is the color because the enjoyment of each one is the same.  The all-around sound is quite good and the bluetooth works perfectly.  I have not yet used it with my phone because when I'm being entertained by these headphones, I prefer not to be interrupted but I assume it works just fine.  For the price, this is an excellent buy and I would recommend them highly.  I've also been complemented by the attractiveness of the white set.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"I bought 2  headphones, 1 Noise cancelling and 1 without noise cancelling. First of all I dislike the headphones without noise cancelling the bass sounds very muddy and overbearing. I would have thought that the noise cancelling headphone would have been that way and the reason I bought the headphones both ways. Do yourself a big favor and purchase the noise canceling phones, the sound is so much better. The bass has a much better sound and the highs come out nicely. When you listen to these noise cancelling headphones in the non cancelling switch position you get the muddy bass and inconsistent highs. I listen to mine in the noise canceling position all the time. for the money these are a very good buy.",3,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"I like these headphones for how they sound- I can block out ambient noise when listening to music or on a zoom call- so that's the 2 stars. However, the mic just doesn't work and for $70, that's just unacceptable. I figured I was doing something wrong, but that's not the case and I missed the return window! Nobody can hear me on a zoom call or bluetooth call. I wouldn't recommend buying these again since the idea was to use the for remote work and I have to rely on the computer mic & the headphone speaker. They also pair very slowly to any device and I have to constantly pair until it syncs.",2,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0

"NOT actively noise canceling. They do you cancel the “seashell” affect. The sound you hear when placing a seashell to your ear. Cup you palms and place them over your ears; that sound you hear is canceled, NOT external sounds like lawnmowers, airplane engine, leaf blowers or buss engines.Besides that, they are fine for a wireless headset.

So far very happy with the headphones. Excellent quality and great sound!Addl: after about 6 weeks of binge watching various TV series this is a fantastic purchase. My hearing is bad so I bought this so I wouldn't disturb the family when I stay up late. The sound is so clear I can understand everything. I was watching one night and didn't realize my wife was using her karaoke in the same room!!!! The battery life is great and believe me I've put in a lot of listening hours. Also the tv series I've been watching had some Metallica and AC-DC and the sound was awesome 😊,5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"Just got these today and so far the headphones themselves are awesome. The 3.5mm jack that came with it needs to be fiddled with to have both sides of the headphones play music but that isn't a big issue, might just be the cord. The headphones have a control button on the right side that lets you know if you are running the bluetooth signal or not and also acts as an audio controller. If you tap one of the two sides you can skip ahead a song or back a song and hold on side or the other to turn the volume up a notch.The only issue I have with these headphones so far is that i'm pretty sure the only way to use the noise cancellation you have to connect them to a device with bluetooth as it probably uses your phones microphone to analyze what sound to cancel out. Also when you slide the button into the noise cancellation slot you get this light drowned out effect, kind of like the music is a bit farther away. That itself isn't too much of an issue because if you have the noise isolation on you'd most likely be caring more about the sound it's blocking out and not the sound quality itself.",4,1,2017-6-11,1,2,0
"These headphones have very good sound and they are soft and comfortable to wear.  To be clear, they do NOT cancel all noise; you can still hear people talking.  I bought these to use on a long flight to listen to my talking book on my iPod.  They definitely reduced the plane engine noise but I was still able to hear the person next to me talk to her companion, but it was not nearly as loud as it would have been without the headphones.  All noise was much less distracting, and it was much easier to hear my talking book.  I am pleased with my purchase, and it does the job for me!",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
"I have put these to the test daily with my night walks along a busy neighborhood as well as my day strolls along a river. They are great for listening to music, audio books or talking on the phone via blue tooth. They have never given any problems with comfort or quality. In the past I had only used the Bose models but this time after several models I opted for something different. Would do this again.",5,1,2019-5-23,1,1,0
"Well, this is the first pair of blu-tooth headphones I've ever purchased and so my complaints aren't necessarily directed at this specific make and model but, I suppose, at the kind of headphones these are. These are extremely frustrating headphones for a person who is used to simply plugging in a pair of headphones and listening to whatever they wish. That, apparently isn't how these type of headphones work. No, these need to be charged constantly, just like a smart phone, and they will not work if you bang your head. Now, if you're like me - I am a punk and metal head, and when I listen to music, I tend to bob my head up and down... but this device is not made with that in mind, every time I bang my head (let's say in the downward motion) the sound cuts off. Extraordinarily frustrating for me.I now know that I will never again purchase a pair of blu-tooth headhones again, as they do not do what I want them to do unless my head is remaining perfectly still - for example, when I watch Game of Thrones or something - but will not work when listening to the music that I enjoy.",3,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"They aren't super expensive and give you great quality for the 40-60 you pay.  These do great for me while studying and just needing some peace and quiet.Pros: comfortable, great battery life, nice aux cord that's optional to use, good sound compared to what im experienced with.  I can use them for a while before I need to take them off.",4,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
Headphones are of decent quality. Comfortable to wear for short periods. Sound quality seems off for the price you pay. Requires considerable tweaking between the headphones and device with the volume when paired with bluetooth otherwise there is a definite buzz in the background. Noise canceling option does not really seem to be useful. You need to adjust the volume on the paired device along with the headphone in order to find a sweet spot. The headphone does not remember the settings once power is off.  I would consider a different pair of headphones if you want to use bluetooth.,3,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
Will be taking several trips this year and wanted a pair of noise cancelling headphones.  Wasn't sure if I wanted to get a bluetooth or wired pair.  When I found out these could be both plus the online coupon I felt I couldn't lose by trying these.  So far I can only say the noise cancelling quality is good.  I have nothing to compare to since I've never had a pari before.  I will know shortly as I will be flying in a couple of weeks.  They are very comfortable on the ears and the sounds is excellent.  I did notice the bass was deeper when using only bluetooth and thinned out a bit when the noise cancelling was enabled.  But that's minor as the sound was still very good.  So far these are going to be just fine and look forward to using these on my upcoming flights.,5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"The sound quality is good @ this price point  not great but my major complaint is they don't play loud enough for me. There is a lot of base and @ higher volume might cause damage to the headphones. They  do have a full almost theater like sound , I haven't made up my mind on weather or not I will keep or return them. I have to play them @ full volume to enjoy them @ all. If you like your music loud these may not work for you, if you agree with my assessment of these HP's and have found something that works for you please comment.I may update this review.",3,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0
"I really loved these. They were comfortable, great sound, I can't say it was super noise cancelling. Say someone was talking I'd be able to hear something but not make out what was said, I actually liked that because I have kids if I'm needed I'd like to know. My husbands skullcandy headphones are way more sound cancelling and I dont like them or the cabin pressure.I purchased june of 2019 its july 2020 and they just stopped working. They died I plugged them in but won't work now. So disappointed. Because they only lasted me a year I unfortunately have to find another set and I won't be purchasing this brand.",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

The sound cancelling feature is nice too, especially when on the cardio equipment at the gym. I would highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"I love these headphones.  I purchased them when I moved in with my parents to help as my mother's health declined.  They are really great for being able to listen to my own videos and such while they're doing their own things.  They're super comfortable and durable.  I even dropped them into a pail of water from my head.  I rescued them immediately but they were just fine.  I've learned to be more careful bending over with them on, of course.  I guess I'd be wise to add a strap for the back of the head while I'm doing chores!  I'd definitely buy these again!",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"From the reviews I had read, I expected a nice product.  I was still surprised by what I received.  This over-ear headset is extremely well put together, the fit and finish are just short of artful.  pair them with the device of your choice and the surprises keep coming.  I started by pairing with my Samsung Note 10+, then loaded my favorite Spotify playlist and my favorite EQ app.  The hum of my 3d printer disappeared, thanks to the active noise canceling and all I heard were crisp clear vocals and deep rich melodies.  I waited too long to buy the Cowin E7 headset, but I am very glad I have it now.  If you are in the market for an over-ear Bluetooth headset, I suspect you too will be pleased with this one.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"You get what you pay for, folks. No surprise, I know, but it's definitely true in this case. Are you going to be getting the quality of Audio Technica, or high priced Bose? No. But, these are servicable headphones that I got to use while woodworking, and they get the job done. Long battery life, easy BT connection, good quality sound, and gets pretty loud. Do recommend if you want some headphones that do the job, but don't want to pay a ton of money. I like the color too, which is why I picked them. Well done.",4,1,2019-3-21,1,1,0
"People use a review for their 2 seconds of fame. A few years ago I bought some beats by Dre. These are just as good or maybe better. I paid $200 for my beats. These earphones are bass heavy and definitely noise canceling. Those people who said they love them are right and those others are doing to much. I paid $54!! TOTAL!! I loved them the second I turned them on!! Don’t keep shopping, get your before they are gone or go up in price. No need to pay for the more expensive ones these are FIRE!! For $50 I could care less if the other are louder these are too loud to turn up all the way and for $50 I can have a pair for home and a pair for exercise!! Amazon redeemed themselves in my heart with these!!",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I have had these headphones for about 14 months.  They have worked well both wireless and tethered.  Sound quality is what was expected.  What has blown me away has been Cowin's customer service and warranty.My right ear cup became detached from the headset and broke the wire. They became detached at the swivel point where at closer inspection is really a plastic bearing.  It was clearly cracked.  Other reviews have noted this problem.

"We have both the E7 and SE7 in the COOLTOYS.TV offices.  The E7 is by far above the best bargain in noise cancelling headsets that we could find. We tested it playing games on PC's, PS4, and making cell calls and talking on zoom classes and The only place this fell short was the microphone when being used for dictation.  If I could rate this like the olympics I would give the Cowin E7 a 4.75.  All that said, if you have the money, the BEST bang for the buck period is the Cowin SE7.  The SE7 does everything the E7 does a little better and the microphone had a 100% accuracy with apple dictation feature.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Awesome head set for the price! I absolutely love wearing them for my Audio on my tablet, Music on my MP3, and for watching TV without having to turn up the TV volume...I have my headset,makes happy for others!!

"Sound quality is fine for these headphones the problem is that they are absolutely worthless if you intend to use the microphone. It's not that the mic isn't connecting. Its that when the mic is being used, unmuted/in call, I lose all sound. Everything, background apps and the other person in the call. I tested this in Discord, TeamSpeak, and Skype to be sure it wasn't a setting in the program I was using and there are no settings beyond which mic are you enabling. And yes the E7 is the input selected. There is a forum post from the end of last year where other people are reporting this same problem, supposedly it's from a win10 update at the end of Dec 2019. But when I got in touch with Cowin they wouldn't say anything other than ask if I wanted a refund or an exchange. Nothing. It's been three days of back and forth where I tell them no I don't want either I want help with this problem. They won't even acknowledge the problem. Just, can I get you a refund or exchange? This isn't good customer service.I tried very very hard to get these to work. I did my own basic trouble shooting, I searched online for possible answers, I contacted Amazon to see if they had run into the problem, and I've been in contact with Cowin support for three days now and they have been less than helpful. It would have been better if they hadn't answered at all instead of looping back to the same message over and over. Because now even if they reach out to try and solve the problem I can't trust them.",1,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"The headphones would be fantastic, they're comfortable, the sound (as long as noise cancellation is not switched on) is good, and they look great...but the second that you activate the noise cancellation feature, which is why you bought noise cancelling headphones I'd imagine, they become unusable. Just about ANY movement, including walking, will cause the sound to cut in and out while in noise canceling mode, and NO ONE buys noise cancelling headphones to sit quietly at home...you buy them to cancel the noise in places where you would be using them that may be noisy.It's for this reason alone, that I can not recommend these headphones.",1,1,2020-1-10,1,2,0
"I really liked these headphones when I got them, but I’m disappointed that the “leather” is already peeling off after one year of use. I have a different pair of headphones I bought around the same time for half the price of these and they haven’t shown any signs of peeling. I use both about the same amount.Another annoying feature is that the volume buttons are backwards. The top button turns down the volume. Not sure if it’s like that on all the headphones or just the ones I received.",3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,1
"Pros: Bluetooth, Noise Cancellation, Long-lasting battery (I learned the hard way how long the battery can actually last as you'll see in the ""cons"" section), relatively quick charge, very comfortable around ears and on the head, not heavy but not too light (ideal weight), clear sound, very nice packaging with some extras, and the 24-month warranty for only $7.99 is an amazing deal.Cons: Once, the headphones completely died and after overcharging them the Bluetooth stopped working. I did some research and found that I needed to completely drain the battery again by leaving it on NC mode, which took nearly 3 days (about 60 hours), and then I recharged them using the original charger and finally, it was fixed. To avoid this I recommend not allowing the battery to completely die, don't overcharge (charging overnight), and use the original cable. Besides this little hiccup, the headphones have been working great these past 30 days.",4,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"Everything about these headphones deserves a 5 star rating. First I purchased these for ny son for Christmas. Little did I know that his sister purchased the same item. It’s better that I return mine than to have his sister return her purchase. After all the presents were done I sat down with the Cowin E7’s. I own Bose QC35II’s. So I don’t want to render a review pitting the CowinE7’s against the Bose. First, the sound is excellent. Really surprised me. I have to admit they are comfortable, I believe extended wear time may be an issue. While trying these headphones I played different genres from classical to early rock & Roll. Again, they did a pretty good job. I have to admit the noise canceling is top shelf. If you’re looking for a great set of headphones, give these a shot.",5,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
"This is unfortunate. I bought these headphones because I work in a Data Center. On occasion, I have to talk to people while in the DC to help to resolve whatever issues are occurring. The microphone on these not only pick the outside noise, but it seems to amplify it.

"I owned the Bose QC35s until they were stolen.  Couldn't bring myself to drop another $350 on QC35s so I decided to try these.  They're very good for the price-- decent audio, easy to pair.  They're definitely NOT on par with the QC35s, though.  Noise cancelling isn't nearly as good.  They're a bit tight on the skull.  The build quality is good, but not great like the QC35s.  They also look a bit more flashy than I would like.",4,1,2017-6-29,1,3,0
"Really nice headphones. Great sound. However, the noise cancellation barely exists and the cups hurt my ears after an hour or so. At times the bass felt exaggerated and, the noise-cancelling would get into a weird sync, causing a very uncomfortable throbbing like when the rear windows of your car are down. The control button(s) on the right eara were also kind of uintuitive. After trying them out for a week, I returned them for the TaoTronics TT-BH060 - which so-far has superior noise cancelling and similar sound - and the controls make a lot more sense. Very thankful for Amzn's return policy - helping me getting to the best product for my needs.",4,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0
"Great buy. The battery lasts forever. I’ve left these on a few times paired to my device and it barely appears to put a dent in the battery life, literally watched shows the night before, left them on and paired all day, came back and watched shows for the next few days, still no low battery.Noise canceling wise, they are good. Perfect for mowing the grass or similar activities but if you are running loud equipment for long periods, these unfortunately will not cut it.",5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0

My only complaint is the very sensitive side button which if accidentally pressed or held in a certain sequence will dial random contacts from my phone. This is a very embarrassing issue when I accidentally fall asleep on the button and the headphones dial someone.Update: customer service with both Amazon and Cowin continue to be very helpful and after leaving a 1 star review they contacted me multiple times offering a refund.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
I am hard of hearing and I hear much more clearly when watching movies with my Cowin E7 headphones. I didn't realize how much detail I was missing from the soundtrack until I received  these as a gift.We also watch a lot of British programming and it is easier to understand the accents too.

"This headset is ready to go to work out of the box. Very low learning curve. Easy to understand the functions and they all work well. NR is better than all but one in the market, and it was north of $300. Built sturdier than all the much higher priced units. Sound is excellent, but I'm not an expert, its just  have heard a whole bunch of cheapo speakers and headsets through the years, and know good sound when I hear it. This has good sound! I've broken several headsets over the years, or, they break and fall off my head! its not like I lofted them across the room.

The feedback and hearing 1 person talking from ten different places milliseconds off makes me crazy.  These are great.  The sound is amazing and I don't feel like I'm in my own meeting.Using them to listen to music is awesome too.  It's like being at a concert.

My music from my iPhone sounds great through them and I made a few calls with it. The calls sounded great and the people that I called said that they could hear me very well.Very well built, heavy duty, these will not break easily.

I connect to my Fire TV stick and can walk all around the house and even on the back deck and it rarely disconnects.

I am highly impressed with the sound quality, the noise cancellation, and the battery life.

It crackled and broke the sound even when the device it was paired with was less than a foot away. That was it’s fatal flaw. I can handle some trade off due to price but crackling connectivity at any distance is unacceptable. Additionally, It’s noise canceling ability is quite a bit less than Bose.

"***Update:  On seeing my review, I received a message from Cowin asking how they could make the situation right.  And they really did!  As previously stated, my headphones were outside the warranty period (which was MY fault that I didn't remember/keep tabs on that).  However, their customer service still went above and beyond in providing me with a replacement set of headphones.  While I won't be buying this particular model again, Cowin still has my attention due to their outstanding customer outreach.  I wanted to wait to update this review until I had some time with my replacement headphones.  They are fantastic!  I can listen for 8 hours straight for a couple of days until I need to charge them again.  And the material feels a lot more sturdy!Previous review:  I've owned these headphones for just over 19 months now.  I bought them because I was looking for noise-cancelling, bluetooth headphones at a decent price.  I was impressed for the first month or so.  The sound quality was completely fine (I'm not an audiophile or anything, so my standards aren't super high), and the noise-cancelling was fine (except when I was wearing my glasses or chewing gum.  It would cause small ""pops"" in the audio from the movement).  I use these at work, and the battery life was fantastic and still is.  I basically live in my headphones during my workday, and I can still listen for my entire 8-hour shift without needing a charge.  Then I put them on a charger until the next day, ""rinse and repeat"".  Within two months of buying them, the joint where the speaker meets the headband completely broke (it's just made of plastic).  This was on the right side.  Fortunately I had some electrical tape and super glue that re-attached the speaker, but now the swivel motion was completely unavailable and the headphones just didn't fit as well as before.  About two months later, the left side did the exact same thing.  They broke in the same spot, and got the same super glue and tape treatment.  I had forgotten there was an 18-month warranty for quality-related issues and I could have possibly done something about it, but I dropped the ball there so I'm now outside of the 18-month warranty.  Fast-forward to now. The super glue on the right side is starting to give a bit, and I find myself shopping for a new set of headphones.  I really wanted these to work out longer than two years, but they just weren't built to be used for 8 hours every day over multiple months.  I would like to say I got what I paid for, but I honestly feel I got less than what I paid for.  I might be willing to try this brand again if they upgraded their materials to include more metal components for increased durability.  The head band part is metal, but the joints need to be made of something better than plastic.  If not, this might be my first and last purchase of this brand.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones because I needed something better to wear over my ears while mowing the yard. I figured the noise-cancelling feature would make things better. And they did. With these on the mower noise is reduced to about the same as a vacuum cleaner (to me) and I can hear everything clearly.So far they have lasted quite some time on only two charges, and the Bluetooth connection to my iPod is solid. No crackling, no cut-outs, and pairing process is smooth. These are great headphones at this price. I will have to see how they hold up over a longer period of time, but the last few months have been good.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
I purchased these to watch TV without disturbing others in near by rooms. I the appearance of the head set was the first to appeal to me. I purchased a black with silver trim and I found them yo be very attractive with excellent sound quality. They have adjustable head sizes although the small size worked best for me.  They are very comfortable to wear over long periods. The Bluetooth was easy and quick to set up. I can not comment on the battery life as they are new but I can say they charge up relatively quickly. So far I have been very happy with them and I would recommend them to others looking for a similar product. They do come with a storage bag that you can take with you.,5,1,2018-12-25,1,1,0
"I can get the microphone to work on Windows 10.  Device manager shows 2 pairs of headphones connect but only 1 pair displays in the output devices in the Sound Settings.  Troubleshooting plays the tone and then when I confirm I can hear the tone, it ends the troubleshooter. The driver is obviously not relaying the right information to Windows to have the headphones properly display in the Sound Settings. Horrible setup.After finally going through the old Control Panel to fix the audio (which was able to present more options to pick a primary audio device) I finally have the headphones working. The bass is decent but the treble and mid tones are very canny sounding. It's distracting enough that if I went to a showroom to listen to these before buying them, I definitely would have not bought them. The acoustic balance is VERY noticeably off.",2,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is true for these headphones. They are physically good quality, with a nice heft, good ear padding, and comfortable headband. The sound quality is very good, and the setup is a cinch; I had no problems connecting/using them with either my MacBook Pro or my iPhone XS Max. The noise cancellation feature, though, is a little bit flimsy--it works moderately well if there is relatively light background noise and whatever you are listening to is fairly robust, but they don't do a great job of dealing with noises that are louder or particularly close to you. Overall, though, I'm pleased with them--I bought them to help me deal with being in a shared office with three other people, and they've done just fine for that purpose.",4,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
"Bought these to use on my home system. I have to admit I was looking for a corded set and was a bit leery of the wireless stuff. But I couldn't pass on the deal the E7's had. The headphones arrived ahead of time in excellent condition. Opened up the box, charged them up and they paired effortlessly with my mac. I tested them out on a few tracks of Pink Floyd and they sounded great. Now if you're looking for LOUD headphones these probably aren't for you but my days of buzzing in my ears are long past. I think for the price and quality of these you just can't go wrong.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"These are excellent headphones for the price. The color and design is great. I have a small head and wear glasses, and these headphones fit nicely for me for long periods of time without putting must stress on the ears like other over ear headphones do. I love the Bluetooth range, I can get up and move multiple rooms away from the source device and have no interruptions with the connection, the only problem I've noticed is that I can hear my footsteps through the speakers when I walk barefoot on hardwood floors, but it's minor.Cowin is definitely a company that is proud of their products and takes care of their customers. I definitely recommend getting the ""Hard Travel Case for COWIN E7 / E7 PRO Active Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones"" for the purpose of storage and protection.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I have been looking for a pair of headphones for months now. I am the person who reads the reviews and the number of reviews a product has. So I’m careful as to when I purchase anything online or in general. I use these headphones for when I’m jogging. And have been using these headphones daily for two weeks now. They are super comfortable, they do cancel out the noise and the sound quality is great. Because the noise canceling is so good I tend to not cover my ears completely so that I can hear cars/people around me when I’m jogging. But that is just me. Everything that is described about the headphones are exactly that. I love that they come in multiple colors. My kids enjoyed the red ones I picked out that they want to pick out a color of their own. Great quality for the price. No complaints.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

"I received my Cowin E7 on Saturday...they arrived as promised and packaged very attractively....the sound is pretty good, for the price you shouldn't expect sound quality of the expensive ones...to me they seem to be heavy, I'm going to try them out again today and see if they still seem heavy or if it was the way I was sitting that made my neck and head hurt...they really aren't ""noise cancelling"", but I'm not sure you would want them to cut out all the noise...they connected immediately to my laptop (MacBook Pro) and to my iPad, but they won't connect to my iPhone for some reason..all in all I would recommend them",4,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
"These are really good headphones. I’m a stickler when it comes to headphones or anything electronic, and right away I knew these were going to work out. But, I didn’t want to just write a rating without giving them a good testing. Now I’ve had the headphones for 7 months and everything is, and has been working great. Perfect sound quality, great battery life (like un-believable) and they look good. They are a little big looking once you have them on, which I didn’t care about how big they look. I use these around my house and around my business and I’ve never had an issue. When I wear them outside and sweat, no problems I clean the pads off and keep going. Anyway, these are worth about $150 to $180 in my book. So at $59 to $70 they are a steal. I’m super glad I purchased these.",5,1,2019-5-27,1,0,0
"Ive owned several pairs of these same headphones, the E7 noise cancelling. These headphones are amazing whether connected by Bluetooth or an auxillary cable. I've never owned any of the more expensive name brands. But these are perfect for music and tv. I use them everyday and the battery lasts for probably well over a week or two. They never hurt my head or ears.I've also used them on a few plane rides and the noise cancelling worked great. I highly recommend them.",5,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
"I've been using these for a few days. The packaging is nice and the headphones come with a dust bag for storage. I have been listening to various types of music while I work from my iPhone XS. They're light and comfortable. The range is good. I can leave the phone downstairs while i walk upstairs. The operation is straight-forward. Battery life is impressive as well. I plan to travel to Asia soon and bought them for the purpose of noise cancellation on the long flight. I tested them out while cutting my lawn and they do a decent job. The ear pads are soft enough that I could wear sunglasses with the headphones comfortably. This is something I've struggled with when using noise cancelling headphones in the past. Overall, they're good and seem to be solidly built and a great value for the price.",5,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"I was looking to purchase a pair of Beats headphone, but I didn't wan't to hundreds of dollars for them. Like Beats headphones, this come from China as well and sound just as good in my opinion. The bass is full and rich, but with some songs it can be a bit boomy. In that case I just turn down the volume down a tad bit and the problem goes away. Super comfortable and I can wear them for hours. Overall a solid pair of headphones for the price. Buy with confidence !",5,1,2019-1-18,1,1,0

"I started to travel a lot and needed something better than traditional earphones.  Was doing some research and after a few days got an email related to the Cowin E7 headphones.  I had been looking at other more expensive brands but didn't want to pay that kind of money.  The pricing on these and a discount I received made them a great deal price wise.  So now the real test was would I get what I paid for or more than my money's worth.  I absolutely got more than my money's worth!!  The features these headphones have are awesome.  The ability to answer calls and hear with such clarity is great.  The noise canceling is great - have never had a pair of noise canceling and couldn't believe the difference it made to my ears.  The sound when listening to movies on the airplane - Wow!  Just an overall great quality headphone.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Couldn't be happier with the quality of the headphones - fit, feel, construction.  Absolutely love the way they sound in my ears!!  I don't think you can go wrong with these if you're not looking to drop a lot of money but want bang for the buck.  I advise buying these and the few people I have shared them with agree.",5,1,2019-4-3,1,0,0
"""TUNE OUT THE WORLD, FOR $70"" Noise cancelling that works at a very reasonable price! Give BOSE credit for a great idea but the ""concept"" is well out of the barn! These phones sound great, are very comfortable to wear, 30 hour play time and if you do manage to run down the batt. just plug them in to the wired input to connect the phones to the player and keep listening.As I tried to quickly discuss in the video the fit and comfort of these phones will vary with different size and shape heads so you'll just have to try them on. (think shoes) As far as sound, I am a retired professional studio musician, trumpet player, and I've used headphones that would sell for around $5,000 at today's prices, so let's not go crazy comparing apples & oranges! At $70 these are a great deal and you should be satisfied with the sound and comfort at this price. It's worth the extra $10 to buy these, with the noise cancelling feature, for 2 reasons. The noise cancel works very well, plus you get the choice of 2 E.Q. settings when you switch from B.T. to N.C. As HAWAIIANS would say, ""CHANCE UM""!! Product received for professional evaluation. OH, one more thing, I failed to mention if you get too far from the transmitter and start to lose the signal make sure to turn you head so the receiver (in the ear piece with the volume and on and off button) is facing in the direction of the signal. Any B.T. device with two separate pieces will have the receiver in one piece and the batt. in the other.",5,0,2016-5-15,1,1,0
"Edited 13Apr18:  The replacement set of headphones has a separate problem: if you happen to touch either earpiece, it creates a sound like your ear is under water...not sure if there is a problem with the wiring or not.  With this fault shortly occurring after the previous one, I can’t really recommend these.Also a couple of people have said the headphones look huge.",2,1,2018-3-26,1,2,0
"I spend a lot of time working in an area that has a pretty high noise level caused by devices that make use of compressed air. The noise is pretty consistent in frequencies and volume. These headphones do a good job of cancelling out the constant hiss of the compressed air and the sound quality is not exactly great but it's pretty decent. I'm not sure why some have complained of short Bluetooth range. I was able to roam in the open floor area easily 40 feet from my PC. I was skeptical of the battery life claims but, I have went for 30 hours at a stretch between charges.The only real complaint I have is that they will occasionally disconnect for no apparent reason, but then again that could be my PC's fault.",5,1,2017-3-18,1,1,0
"I purchased these headphones just a few months ago, January 2020.  I’ve only used them twice.  They will now not charge via the USB cord.  They’ve been at room temperature of about 70 degrees and I’ve even tried another USB port to electric and no luck.  The red light comes on when I attempt to charge then within 5 seconds goes off and they will not charge. this in unacceptable and I’m attempting to get assistance.  When they worked the 2 times I used them, they were great, but can’t give them even a “just ok” rating at all, not a good buy unfortunately, I’m disappointed.",1,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I confused this with the E7 PRO so I was a little disappointed that they do not have a hard case, but that's on me. The noise cancelling is not really that great. I can still hear my phone and a fan on low over the NC feature. The base actually rattles the speakers which was surprising as I was expecting a thump, but that tells you the headset seal is good around your ears and not allowing leaking outside the headset when you are wearing them. The mic is great for calls. I haven't experienced any audio or call lagging either. Overall the sound is what you expect for this price range. The buttons are opposite what you would expect, and the connection can be a little wonky so I removed a star.",4,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"I would give these of 5, except they fairly easily broke when I set them down in an airplane.  I had found these good quality for the price and a great addition to my travel ensemble. I fly a lot, and on airplanew, I needed a good audio environment for a relaxing and working. But on my third flight, when I set them down, the plastic on one side snapped. My husband has been able to glue them back together, though it has less mobility now for that side of the headset. I was surprised how easily a core part of them broke. It still functions fine, but this did not meet my anticipation.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
Do not buy!!I was really looking forward to these earphones as it had a lot of good reviews.  However when I tried the noise cancelling my eardrum was assaulted by loud static.  I was willing to overlook this by just using it on the BT setting.  What I am upset about is that it will not pair with my phone or tablet after doing so initially.  I'm returning these with a strong warning for those with sensitive hearing and low tolerance rubbish.,1,1,2019-2-6,1,2,0

I will say that I don't think this is an intended feature of the product.  I'm pretty sure that the pair I received is defective.  I am sending them back, but I still had to listen to cutting out of sound and crying children because this headset is defective.

"For the past 50 years I’ve owned about every kind of headphone you can think of. This is my first pair of noise cancelling headphones. I bought them mainly for airplane travel and I didn’t want to spend a fortune on them. I figured if they didn’t sound good and the cancelling isn’t effective, I’ll send them back. I’m glad to review that both features are very good. The sound quality is as good as any headphones I’ve ever owned. The noise cancelling is acceptable with some ambient noise still noticeable but tolerable. I highly recommend these headphones for the sound quality alone. I can’t speak to the durability of them since I’ve only had them a short time.",5,1,2019-3-9,1,0,0

"They work. Great battery life. Not uncomfortable. The sound quality is meh. You have the active noise cancellation mode, which works OK for the lower frequencies although the passive sound insulation will still allow through much of the higher frequencies that the active system can't handle (all active NC systems have this issue. There's a technological limit to the frequencies that active noise cancellation can handle. The rest of the frequencies are handled by the sound insulation of the physical headphones). Don't expect silence, but it will noticeably bring down ambient sounds. The other mode is the ""Bass boost"" mode, which, stay away. Bass boosting headphones are just a bad idea in general (I didn't realize that this was a feature of these headphones when I bought them) unless you like your audio muddy. Cheap bass boosting is even worse.TL,DR",3,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0

"My wife bought these for me as a Christmas gift of 2018 because I decided to go back to school. I think they work great, especially for the price. I've compared them to other students Sony's and I think these were by FAR the better deal. They Sony had a couple of settings for noise canceling and the sounds  were barely cleaner, but not for another $200! -  I bought a hard case for them and they only see daylight when they're on my head, otherwise they're back in their case for safety. Just ten minutes ago I was putting them on my head, when they left side broke loose. Maybe mine is a fluke, I think they should have lasted WAY more than a year - especially for as much care as I gave these.Update Jan 2020,",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,1
Either I don't 100% understand the wired and wireless supported headphone space or the wired aspect of these headphones was an afterthought.I assumed utilizing wired mode without noise cancelling would nagate having to charge the device.

"Honest review here,Had them for a few days, but could not get over how cheap the plastic looks. Its very shiny and looks like a$20 toy.  Unit is  very bulky and does not even fold. Sound quality is good, comfort is amazing, but it fall off laying down. ANC is not that great but gets the job done. Feels very flimsy, and does not come with a hard case just a bag. Honestly I could not store this thing anywhere but on my neck. And its Bluetooth 4.0.  I returned it. I got the VIPEX Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth 5.0 Headphones instead. ANC is much better you actually feel like you are underwater, kinda like the bose ones. Not as comfortable but I can fold them, and actually store them in my backpack, they come with a hard case. I would not recommend the COWIN E7. Looks too cheap",1,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"These are nice headphones for the price. I was afraid the ear cups would not fit me but they are very comfortable and go around my (admittedly smallish) ears perfectly. The head band is nicely padded and the right length for me. I tried a pair by a different brand that the headband was too long so that the ear covers pushed down - these are prefect without any adjustment. I do not need to make them longer which may affect fit for those with larger heads. They do not shift dancing around my living room and they significantly reduce the fan noise from my lab in the noise-cancelling position. I like that you can extend battery life by disabling this feature with just the shift of a switch. They sound crisp, clear and true. I am very happy so far.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,1
"I was sceptical when I ordered these - how good could a $60 pair of bluetooth over-ear headphones really be? I've mostly spent over $150 in the past and even those have not been great. When these arrived I immediately took them on a very noisy bus ride and was blown away by the quality of the sound and the noise cancelling. They look very sleek, fit perfectly over my (admittedly on the large side) ears, and sound fantastic. The sound cancelling is way better than I expected at this price, but will obviously not be exactly as good as a $300 pair. I'd highly recommend this for anyone on a budget.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0

"Ok- I’ll start off by saying that I am in no means a headphone expert.  The best pair I have ever owned up until this point were $30 Sony headphones that back in the 90’s- were pretty expensive for a high school/college kid. So with that being said- I love these headphones.  They sound amazing and I really enjoy mowing the grass and doing yard work while wearing them. In fact- I look forward to mowing the grass now, lol.  They definitely drown out the riding mower and weed eater while I’m wearing them. They are very comfortable and I love that they are wireless.  The Bluetooth works amazing and according to my wife- she can hear me just fine if I’m using them for a phone call- so thats another plus.  I also really like that I can control basic iPod/music functions through the headphones (volume and track skip) and don’t have to take the iPod out of my pocket once I start playing music.  My daughter has the wired Beats and I think these sound just as good if not better than those.  So for the price - I highly recommend these!!",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"The sound quality is outstanding. Better than any I've heard. The sound canceling aspect is a bit less wonderful.

I can sleep all night long, 10+ hours on one charge and still use them the next day. The fit of the headphones is very tight. I can't seem to adjust them to fit any better, so I'm hoping that they loosen up a bit over time, because I did get a headache from them once. And I love the color!",4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"The Cowin E7 worked as expected. For the price they sound decent with multiple types of music, not excellent or poor with any particular type. I like bass and although they were not absent of quality lows, I found myself turning up the volume hoping it would satisfy my desire for deeper frequency response.  I also have a pair of mpow H10 noise canceling headphones. The mpow H10’s have more bass, but both perform very close to the same in all other aspects.  The cowin’s greatly lessen airplane noise and did help to make me feel more fresh after a 8 plus hour flight. I’m happy with my purchase for the price.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"First thing first, my package arrived in a manner of only a few days after purchasing. The quality of the way the headphones were packaged, BLEW ME AWAY!!  The great offers inside the packaging was even better!  Now to the headphones (lol): The sound is crisp and clear, the music is not directly in the ear & horribly loud- but smooth & more surround sound, the bass is out of this world mellow; perfect pitch & tone. The volume control is optimized with your ear/hearing safety in mind; while forwarding to the next song is quick & easy. Most importantly, the staying power after charging the Cowin E7 headphones is UNBELIEVABLE!!  I literally charge these headphones once every two months! Seriously!  I've never had any other headphones with this type of staying power! The investment to purchase the Cowin E7 headphones was, by far, one of my GREATEST!

Better sound than I expected, and so comfortable. I don't use the NR feature because the headset itself has great sound reduction. When I tried the NR feature, I noticed what might be interpreted as less bass, but after listening closely, I believe the bass is still there. I think it is the other way around, that is, the background being attenuated is believed to be bass. Hooked up easily to my TV and phone.",5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0

I left my Bose headphones on a plane and didn't feel like paying $300 to get a replacement.  These headphones are definitely worth the money.  The Active Noise Cancelling capability does not match the Bose - but then this product is less than 1/4 the cost of the Bose.  I like the Bluetooth feature - I had not had that in any of my previous headphones.  I am not sure about the rechargeable battery.  So far it has worked fine.  With the Bose I could just pack an extra battery and not have to worry about it.  With these I need to make sure I have a full charge before traveling.  But I guess it's not a big deal since I have to charge my I-Pad as well.  The headphones come with a cloth bag for storage - I had to buy the hard case separately and I am glad I did.

I turned on noise cancelation and brought the music up just a little and I have to say I couldn't hear much of anything as well as my own voice.  I have never owned headphones with noise cancelation costing hundreds of dollars so it's hard to make an accurate comparison.

"I’ve been holding on to write the review for these headphones. The reason was because I wanted to write the accurate and best review. I was a bit skeptical that if I would like these headphones because of the price. Don’t judge them on that. I usually like heavy bass and sharp treble.  These headphones just sounded great. After I bought them I noticed Sony headphones which were almost 3 times as expensive as these are but still in my budget. I start considering returning these and buying those. I wanted to listen and compare so I went to the store which had those headphones, not only I compare those but also the more expensive $300 to $400 models with these amazing headphones.  These headphones sounded as good as more expensive headphones out there up to $500. I love them and they are my favorite headphones now.

"I bought these for my wife for our recent trans-Atlantic trip, in part because I already had my own set (in black) that I use for travel and at work (open office environment).  A better investment I have never made. Her experience was that she was able to rest (if not sleep) on the flight, and arrived at our destination without the headache and listlessness that she had always previously experienced on long flights. To me, the advantage of the Cowin headphones over more costly brands is that one is not afraid to abuse them (at least a little!), and they still DO THE JOB! The reduction of background noise makes long distance airline travel bearable, and at a reasonable cost. In my opinion, one could spend a lot more money and not get any added benefit.

These met my +wireless, +noise cancelling  +detachable audio cable criteria that I was looking for, and I was so optimistic. Also -- yellow! I get a lot of compliments!Anyways, I've tried to use it on phone calls, every time I'm told that my voice sounds ""muffled"" and that no one can hear me. I thought maybe my apartment had poor cell service?

If I want to use voice capability, I have to settle for muffled tinny sound quality.",3,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
I ordered these from my moms amazon account and i really was not expecting what i got and was weary of how id like them not being able to test them out before i buy them like i typically have to do headphones but for $53 after coupon and taxes id say theyre perfect for what i paid for. Theyre comfy. The noise cancellation isnt perfect but much much much better than my last headphones i bought. And the sound is amazing. Part of having autism is like having supersonic hearing with a lot of stuff and the only time i like that is with music and with these headphones i can even hear when one key of a piano was hit before another key in the same chord. I really wasnt expecting them to be this awesome. And they were fully charged when i got them so i instantly got to start using them without charging rhem and without the aux chord it comes with. It also came with a leather carrying bag so thats pretty cool. Overall 5 stars for exceeding my expectations.,5,1,2020-1-5,1,1,0
"These headphones are AWESOME!!! I primarily use them for online gaming and I am glad I went with the more cost effective set that is these great Corwin E7 as they make my online experience great and at a great cost. Sound is great whether connected directly or through Bluetooth, even without the noise cancelling feature on them. Though to be honest, it not the greatest noise cancelling feature but it just doesn't matter. Whether the music of the game or from whatever you watch through whatever streaming service you use, the music/sound blocks out all other ambient background noise. I love these headphones and am damn glad I got them instead.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0

"This is the first pair of noise cancelling headphones I have owned and I am kicking myself for not getting some of these years ago.  I purchased these for my business trips.  While flying I can really tell a difference using these.  The noise reduction is significant vs using air pods or other standard Bluetooth while in flight.  Typically I would have to turn my volume to max to watch a movie, now I can enjoy the audio without hammering my ears.  These will not totally block all ambient noise but I would say it does reduce it by 20-25%.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0

"These headphones have great sound, truly amazing quality. Noise cancellation is above average. However, I'm rating them overall one star because of the volume controls. Every time I turn them on, the volume is blaring - far too loud to use. And the volume control is a rocker button that takes an act of Congress to get to work. I tried to get assistance from customer support and was never contacted.",1,1,2020-3-10,1,1,0
"I'm very happy with the battery life of this headset.  I think the overall quality of the speakers and audio playback is good for the price.  When I wear the headphones in a computer data center, this headset is very effective in cutting out noise.The noise cancelling doesn't completely block out the people around me in my office but, that is not what noise cancelling is designed to do.  It does help drown out other sounds and this is more effective if you play music at the same time.",4,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
"These headphones blew me out of the water with sound quality, color, and the packaging they came in.  Excellent headphones I would definitely recommend.  The only issue i have ( and it may just be with mine) is the connection cuts out randomly for half second intervals sometimes.  I don't use a lot of bluetooth devices in my apartment, so it's not interference related. I can't find anything online pertaining to it, and it doesn't appear to be a common issue with other people's.  That having been said, I believe these to be a fine pair of headphones",4,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0

I own about 15 pairs of earbuds and head phones and I'd rate the sound quality on these a bit on the lower side but for bluetootyh its actually on the higher end, AND they're very comfy, the battery is supposed to go 30 hours so thats pretty amazing too really, cuts down on the hassle.

"I picked these headphones because I work in an open office and do a lot of video editing. I got sick and tired of coworkers commenting on bloopers and audio edits and decided to finally get some headphones so I can get some work done. I was blown away by the audio quality. I was able to pick up auditory nuances that I'd missed in previous videos and ultimately able to produce better quality content because I can actually hear it. Later I turned on some music. I can barely believe what I've been missing. It's like I had a new set of ears. Not only that but I can bluetooth sync them to my phone. I can't wait to take them to my next video recording session, plug them into my audio recorder and hear what the mics are really picking up.

"For blue tooth headphones, they have great sound and distance from source.  In a quiet space, the noise cancelling works well, but on my lawn mower, I have to turn the volume way up (into the red)--maybe I was expecting too much, since I don't have other ones to compare these to.  For a conference meeting with my computer, it doesn't seem like the speaker works (although it works ok when pared with my phone), so it may be a setting issue with my computer.  Very soft ear pads and head pad, but I don't use them when I am very active or exercise because they are like wearing ear muffs, and I start to sweat with them on.  Overall, I like them.",4,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Liked these for the lightness and noise canceling, but the left ear piece fell off.  Bought this headphone less than a year ago.  No rough use, just listen to music that sounds very well and the bluetooth to my Ipad is exceptional.  They have never left the house since receiving them.  I have another brand that was same price range that don't sound as good but have very strong connecting hinge for the ear cup.  *Update* 9/8/2020  This is the most amazing customer support departments I have ever dealt with.  They offered me three options to resolve my complaint and I received a new updated SE-8 model.  The look, feel, and weight is far Superior to the older model.  The sound and bluetooth is much better. I don't have enough accolades to say about their support in standing behind their products. I would not hesitate to order from this company again.  Follow-up to yesterday have used them last night for four hours and all day today and am extremely happy with the SE-8 for the sound quality and good bass sound.  I found them real comfortable to wear for 3-4 hours.  These are definitely a keeper.",5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,1

"I bought two of these about a year and a half ago. The sound is great, the noise cancelling works. They are very comfortable. But, there is a problem. The joint between the earphones and the band is weak and it broke on both pairs. This is the joint that allows the headphones to swivel so you can lay them flat and fit them into the storage bag. My wife's broke after about 6 months. Mine broke recently after about 1.5. years. I have not mistreated them, and looking at where it broke it seems like it's just a weak spot in the design. In both cases, I just glued it back. They still work, but without that joint moving I can no longer put them away in the storage bag.",3,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0

"I'm posting under my mom's account. My mom bought me the Skull Candy crusher wireless headphones. They broke within the month and for part of that time I was on punishment and didn't even use them. Wack! I've had these three months, no problem. Sound is so much better. The skulls broke on the side where you make the adjustment to extend them to fit your head. I pulled to adjust the headphones on the skulls and the attachment started to give and loosen more and more until it just broke off. The skulls were a birthday present, but my mom was kind enough to let me buy this pair as a replacement. Like I said, sound is much better than skulls. And much better made. I have dropped these, stepped on them (by accident), they've gotten wet. Where the side attachment in the skulls was like cheap plastic, the attachment on these is metal which makes them handle the pushing and pulling I do on my phones. The metal is great, but the sound is too!",5,1,2017-6-21,1,2,0
"I like the noise canceling, sound quality and battery. However, there is a big flaw in these headphones with the Bluetooth pairing. The headphones will pair with whatever first devise they see, so if you are on a place with tons of devices the headphones will just pair with anything and you can’t block that from happening and at that point you cannot pair them with your device. It took me 10 minutes of turning on and off to get them paired with my laptop and not just whatever they decided to pair with. Also, they were not discoverable by a windows laptop, they only worked with Mac and iPhone for me.",3,1,2018-12-22,1,1,0

They are packaged well, look good, are comfortable and most importantly sound great.

I wanted a set that would be reasonably affordable, comfortable to wear for long periods of time, cancel surrounding noise, sound great, prevent sound leak, and ideally be able to make phone calls.I looked around and eventually fell upon the E7 and E7 PRO headphones. I was excited to find a nicely priced set of noise cancelling headphones. I could not decide which pair to buy, so I bought both and tested them out. What I found was they are very similar in quality and sound. I honestly preferred the E7 usability more because the headphone cans seemed easier to adjust and the sound quality was practically the same between the two. I did like the E7 PRO's for the upgraded Bluetooth 5.0 and stylish black headset, I was not a fan of the E7 chrome look.",3,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0

However yesterday I had them sitting in my lap and they started to fall, I brought my legs together (not even quickly, or hard) to stop them from falling and the two ear pieces snapped off. BOTH! The attachment of the ear pieces to the head piece is extremely delicate. I was shocked they both snapped and so easily. They are completely unusable now and don't even power on for some reason. I won't say that no one should buy these, but BE AWARE they are delicate and the ear pieces break off very easily.***Changed to 5 stars, because Cowin immediately offered to replace my headset.

"I have had these for a while but wanted to wait to until I used them for a decent amount time before I reviewed them.  I used these COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Bluetooth Headphones on several flights and in various living conditions and they performed exceptionally.  On one of my flights I actually got to compare a more expensive name brand set that did not perform as well as the Cowin E7's, even though they were triple the cost.  The bluetooth connection pairs easily and the sound is crisp and clear with excellent bass response.  The noise cancelling feature of the headphones was slightly disappointing due to expectations and lack of knowing how they actually work.  I tried out my fellow travelers more expensive pair of noise cancelling headphones and found they did not perform any better.  I wore the Cowin E7 for 3- 5 hour flights, 2 -3 hour flights and 1 - 12 hour flight and they were very comfortable.  My favorite feature of these headphones is the battery life.  I only charged them once and they are still running off of the same charge.  I used the noise cancelling feature through the wired connection 90 percent of the time.

I haven't used them in a noisy environment as yet, but flipping the noise cancelling feature on SO FAR just appears to reduce the volume in the headphones: not sure how that blocks out external sound. However, I'm confused about the glowing reviews for ""customer service"". As mentioned I purchased to headphone sets: one for me and one for my husband. I dutifully when to the Cowin website to register both sets. There site asks for information including a serial number, and indicates where to find it. The number displayed for each earphone set I received was identical, so I was unclear how that would translate to registering 2 sets, since their webpage only had one field for serial number. I started a chat session, and proceeded to provide information. Then I tried to confirm that their webpage only allows input for a single serial number, making it impossible to register two separate earphones. I received no response on the chat...for up to 10 minutes. I kept asking ""anyone there?"", and nothing: no response whatsoever. So I completed the registration page: fingers crossed both sets were registered. Minute later I received a confirmation email, to which I replied, asking the same question about their website, and inquiring if both earphone sets were indeed registered. That was 4 days ago: still no response. My idea of ""customer service"" involves answering a customer's questions.

The ear pads (and headband padding) are probably the softest I have ever experienced. Perhaps most importantly in the comfort/fit category is the fact that these are true, 100% over-the-ear phones for me, despite my largish ears.

I so far have used them for general music listening, noise canceling while mowing and other outside work and so far been pretty good. All in all pretty decent headphones. Only area of real improvement I could recommend is a better microphone for making calls or video chat. Often when making calls people say they can’t hear me very well. Other than that though, great head phones.",4,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"Best affordable headphones I have used in a machine shop (harsh) environment. Head strap and hinges have not broken yet, sealing/comfort rings are still attached and I have used this over baseball caps. Battery lasts all day long and then some and I work loooong shifts.Caveat.. if you ""bounce"" hard when you walk or walk flat footed hard, or stomp as you walk, the noise cancellation gives a ""pop"".  If you walk smooth,  or prance around on your toes, not an issue.",4,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"Out of the box these headphones work great and they are very easy to use.  This is the first product I have bought (except an automobile) that actually came with a user's manual.  Sound is excellent.  I was able to walk all over my home (approximately 65 feet away) and not lose the bluetooth connection (phone was left in the office).  I do find the volume control counter-intuitive.  The bottom button raises the volume and the top button lowers it.  Other than that, I am very pleased with these headphones, especially at this price.  We will see how the battery life is.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"These headphones are a good value.  They work well by any measure.  The battery is long lasting and the sound and noise reduction are quite good.I am used to Sony behind the neck MDR headphones which are light and comfortable for walking; the Cory's are much heavier and are a bit ""unbalanced"".  It has taken me a while to get used to them. I do exclusively audio books, often while I walk 2-3 miles or more for exercise.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"Three stars for three reasons.  1.  Sorry I chose black because my old eyes find it hard to see the switches and connections;  2.  After hours of wearing the headphones, I find that the padding isn't large large enough to cover my small ears resulting in irritated ears; and 3.  There is a hum-buzz when my MacBook Pro is in between programs (during the silence).  None of these reasons are horrible, just annoyances.  The first reason is an easy solution.  The second reason will be harder to figure out; but the third reason would be a return item, if it got any louder.",3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"I have been researching noise canceling headphones for several months, only to find myself coming back to the Cowin brand as my choice.Sure, I could have spent over $300 for a pair of cans; but, for the price, and the good reviews, it was impossible to not give the Cowin E7 a shot.",4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I was more than pleased when I first put these headphones on and turned up the music. What a sound...and with noise cancelling. I can even used them during target practice. Another big plus is the battery life. I use them outdoors, always when mowing. No longer do I have to listen to the din of the mower and can enjoy a book or my favorite tunes. The battery life continually surprises me, I have yet to get a low battery, even after they have been unused for a week or so. The sound quality is amazing, with great bass response. It is easy to connect to bluetooth and has a good range, I can leave my phone on my workbench and work within my 1200 sq ft. barn without a problem. I would encourage you to look at these for your next pair or even for your first. Congratulations Cowin, great product.",5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I saw in many reviews, people claimed that these headphones sounded ""tinny"" or lacking in bass. However, mine I would say probably are a little overdone on the bass! After looking into it I discovered that Cowin revised the E7's around late 2019 with ""Deep Bass"". Essentially they customized the EQ of the headphones to offer more bass.But overall, you really cannot ask for more value for the money. These are simply fantastic little headphones. The plastic build had me concerned at first, but they've been shockingly durable, and the actual band of the headphones is reinforced with metal. The battery lasts several weeks for me on one charge (though, to be fair I am not the most common headphone user these days), and the sound quality is crisp. I almost never have hiccups with Bluetooth. The range is also fantastic, one day I was listening to music from my iPhone 6S while taking out the trash, and only on my way back to the house from the street corner did I realize I'd accidentaly left my phone in the kitchen, and there had been no issue at all!",4,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0

"Can't think of anything I dislike about these headphones. They're comfortable,sound fine so far, so durable and sooo... affordable. I could spend much more money and probably improve quality on one or more levels but really, ""these are not the phones you're looking for"" if you would like to sink into your favorite chair to enjoy your favorite music in complete and total tonal reproduction while being totally uninterrupted. These are the phones you're looking for under the back seat of your car after you have slowed way down for an surprisingly sharp turn.

"If you’re specifically looking for noise cancellation quality this is not your pair. Probably great for everyday music listening or talking on the phone, but barely cancels any noise.

"To give a perspective on my preferences...I've owned many wired headphones over the years with favorites among the Beyerdynamic and Sennhesier lineup.Recent life changes prompted a need for Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones.  I currently own a Sony WH1000XM3 for home use and to deal with noisy neighbors.  However, I sought a cheaper alternative for work and public environments.  Luckily, the Cowin E7 was available on an Amazon daily deal.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"What can I say, you get what you pay for $50 pair of headphones. The noise isolation and cancellation leaves some to be desired, just sounds like the outside is slightly muffled. I would not recommend for ear protection.I have a rather large head, and these do not squish against my temple and does not bother me after wearing them for 3 hours or more. Inside the ear cup fits my large ears comfortably",5,1,2019-4-15,1,0,0
"If you like to listen to classical music or hear the dialogue in movies you might find the over-amped bass on these headphones way over the top, way too much. I listen to a lot of classical music and the extra bass just ruins it. Even when listening to the 60’s rock&rock I grew up with the intensified bass changed how the songs sounded. I will be returning them for this reason.If you like extra bass then these might be great for you. They fit well, were comfortable, the Bluetooth linking was fast and easy. The noise canceling was very good. I would avoid these if you are interested in hearing the finer, more delicate sounds of classical music or the like.",4,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
** UPDATED**I’ve ordered these three times. They work great. Bluetooth sound is great. The first pair broke after more than a year of use so I tried a different brand. One Audio. Those were horrible. They broke within 5 months. But before that I had trouble with them fitting. They stuck out at an angle from the side of my head making it very difficult to hear. You can go read my review of those for more information. The second pair was for my husband and broke after about 6 months. He has a really big head and they never really fit right. So if you have a big head I suggest looking for something else. I got the third pair cause I liked the way they worked. Plus they had a $10 coupon so they were very affordable and I figure if I get another year out of them and take a little caution with them I’ll be happy.,5,1,2018-5-9,1,0,0
"I would consider these headphones a bare minimum for anyone getting headphones anything priced below these are simply garbage. Bass is low and loud right out the box, problem is mids and highs are a little muddied due to a single driver. I use these at work playing spotify drowning out 2 other stereos blasting whatever the other guy is playing. noise cancelling is spot on. These are my second pair, I originally bought for my son and he recommended that I get a pair. Very happy with the purchase and with a really good warranty.Update: 2-16-2020 swivel gave out on the left side after 8 months, they still work. swivel could have been a better design.",3,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0
"I have nothing to compare them to because they’re my first pair of noise cancelling headphones. The sound quality is fine, but honestly not as good as my iPhone earbuds. That being said, the noise cancelling has been a godsend due to my sound sensitivity/anxiety. I was putting laundry away and my husband scared me half to death just by coming into the room unannounced. So yes, they work. They’re worth the money if your main desire is noise cancellation and you’re okay with “meh” (but really not bad, I swear) sound quality.",4,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"Love these headphones for my apple ipad n apple phone, and, desktop. I especially really hear the clarity. When I’m watching tic tok on my iPad. Haven’t had them long.

Forget it!But,  Def recommend !",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,1
"These are awesome.  I've had them for a few months now and taken several flights with them.  The noise cancellation isn't as good as a $300 set of headphones, but it's very good.  The included cable for plugging the headphones into a headphone jack means I can use these on the seatback entertainment screens on flights or as a bluetooth headset for my phone or tablet.  The noise cancellation makes it so I don't have to turn up the in-flight media as loud, which I know is saving my ears in the long term.The only downside is the microphone.  It's really bad.  These headphones are not good for phone calls.  But I didn't buy them for that purpose, so 5 stars from me.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"I purchased these to be used in a noisy office when I need to be on the phone and not sound like a call center.  I was testing them out at home with the TV on.

They are boxed up for return!",1,1,2019-8-29,1,2,0
"Good pair of Bluetooth headphones.  They last for hours without having to recharge. They can feel a bit heavy if you leave them on for too long. I did have a problem when they paired with something I couldn’t figure out and they wouldn’t pair again with my phone, even when I tried the instructions to unpair.  I was able to resolve the pairing issue after searching on the web and reading other reviews.

As a customer in his 60s I know that my hearing is not as good as  when I was in my 20s.  That said I wanted a reasonable cost headphone set -- spending several hundred dollars seemed like too much for an 'old guy'.  Bought a competitors set and it was awful-- bass was mush and muddy even to my insensitive ears.  Purchased the Corwin product  and the difference was dramatic.  VERY GOOD and distinctive bass sound.Easy to setup once you understand that if it is plugged in to charge it will not work.  Must be unplugged from charging to pair/work.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"UPDATE:After about 5 months of light office use.  The  headphones started making ""clicking"" noise when in noise cancelling mode.

"The best thing about these headphones is the ear comfort.  Period.  Noise cancellation feature: almost no change from on to off position.  Want to use the headphones with phone mic feature?  You'll sound like you're talking in a deep, deep tunnel.  Volume controls:  On the right side...on the left side.  Wait, the left side is for looks and doesn't work.  The right side works...good luck locating the controls.  The volume control buttons are fore-aft.  The volume increase is forward, or is it in the back?  I can't find it.  Oh, never mind.  I'm sending them back.",2,1,2019-3-19,1,1,0
"Great headphones when they worked.  Sound quality was great, and they were comfortable.  However, about a week after I got them, they stopped functioning.  I could charge them, and I the indicator light would make it clear that they were plugged in and charging.  The noise cancellation would work, but they would not pair or do anything else.

Unfortunately, after approximately 3 weeks of use only wearing a few times, it seems the blue tooth would not engage--it wouldn't turn on until I toggled the ON,OFF switch several times.  After ensuring the battery was charged, I attempted again and again, getting static noises.  Then the bluetooth engaged and the headphones worked.  However, after about 3 months, the headphones have stopped working all together.I wanted to like these.",2,1,2019-2-18,1,1,0
"I struggled to rate this device because I'm not sure if the issue is my inability to read the descriptions and previous reviews, my understanding of how bluetooth works, or the product itself. This device will not support sounds from multiple applications at the same time. When you are in a Skype/Teams/Slack/Discord chat, all other sounds from the computer cease. This means that for business use, your notifications that the next meeting is about to happen do not come through if you are in a meeting. This means for gaming use, you cannot be in discord and a game at the same time and have the game audio come through. I emailed the seller and they confirmed it cannot do these things. I'd love someone who knows more about these devices to reply to me on what technical spec I'm looking for that would give me an indication of the device's ability to handle two things at once.",2,1,2019-8-8,1,1,0
"I connected the E7 to a laptop computer and it had pretty good audio quality. I tried out the noise canceling feature which I could still hear sounds that I consider relatively quiet. It did block some though. Reportedly the microphone picks up well on the headset.My big issue was the range on the headset. I walked 10-12 feet away to work on another project, open air between the headset and my laptop. It started dropping out and had loss in audio quality. Wanting to make sure it wasn't just the computer bluetooth I connected an Aftershokz headset to it and did not experience any issues at greater range or more interference.",3,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0

It is hard for people to hear me talk on them without the mower running. The battery lasts multiple days and I use these all day everyday. This will be my second set of headphones and will keep buying from them. I put a lot of wear and tear so they won't last as long with me but with normal use they should last for a very long time. They lasted me a year with being shuffled around a lot, dropped, used all day long, used in the rain. Great product!",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0

"I was hesitant to purchase headphones without first trying them on for comfort but I'm pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these are. I'm writing this on my second day of wearing them and they are still feeling good. I purchased these mostly for drum practice but I've been wearing them all day without fatigue. Music sound quality--bass tones are rich but there's less in mid and high tones. Hands-free headset for phone calls--I don't recommend, I can hear the caller clearly but I've been told I sound too muffled plus I cannot hear myself through the headset which is weird. Bluetooth--I can walk all over my house and still get music, it's nice. I last charged it 2 hours ago and have been using them since and my phone says it still has 100% charge.

No disrespect to the Mpows, ijoy type of brands because they really do fill the need for that $20-$30 range but the difference between a pair of $25 headphones and $50 headphones is mindblowing. I will never go back. The comfort, the sound, the fit, the ability to easily connect...everything.I put them on before i knew how to use them. The volume was at about 70% and the Noise cancellation WAS NOT on, I still couldn't hear my friend, or myself speak. If you need a pair of headphones to drown out the outside noise, look no further. Can't express how pleased I am with these.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I think these headphones are good value for the money and very useful if you are studying/working at home during quarantine with others in your household.Great customer service is what really motivated me to write this review. About a month ago a small plastic piece on one side of the headphones broke, so that the cushion on that side would no longer lay flat against my ear. I contacted customer service even though I'd had the headphones almost a year to see if they could be repaired. They got back to me right away, said I was still under warranty, and sent me a new pair for free! I was so happy.

"Pretty good headphones for under $75. The “noise canceling” quality seemed minimal at best and died out after a few weeks, but the sound has consistently been pretty good. Not amazing, but good. The battery life is EXCELLENT - I use my headphones for 2+ hours a day and charge maybe once a week. Definitely the biggest draw. Started noticing cosmetic damage after 6 months of daily usage, and one of the earpieces just fell apart on me (7.5 months in, purchased in Nov 2018) I was able to create a makeshift solution but I don’t know if these will last me another 6 months.",3,1,2019-7-10,1,2,1
"I got this to replace my wired Seinhesser that I loved.  Much to my surprise the Cowin E7 are better at noise canceling for me.  I can hear voices more easily but fans, motors and airplane noise is easily forgotten.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the rechargable battery on these outlasts the alkaline battery on my older Seinhesser's.  The only disappointment was finding in an aircraft with so many others using bluetooth that it was hard to acquire the signal in the plane, but all I had to do was plug in the wire and I was good to go.  In busy airports  like Phoenix, Orlando only once have I had any problems using the bluetooth.  I bought it expecting to only use it during flights  but I now use them as by go to earphones at home and also bought my wife on too.",5,1,2018-3-28,1,0,0
"If you only care about the sound and noise cancelling, these are awesome, and I'd highly recommend them.However, if you want a headset that has a decent quality microphone, you should look elsewhere. It was rather disappointing enjoying these a ton for several days only to have friends tell me they could barely understand me over voice chat when I finally used it for that. Recording myself and listening to the playback confirmed it was definitely the mic, not a networking issue.",4,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"These are my first bluetooth headphones but I'm impressed. I got them as replacement for my old headphones that finally died after 3 years and these are already doing really good.

"I was frustrated by giveaway airline headphones which exclude no surrounding noise and are low fidelity so I thought I would go up-market a little and I'm really glad I did. These Cowin headphones may not have the noice-cancelling power of models from major suppliers costing four times as much, but they are an excellent compromise. I fly long distance (8 hours or more) several times a year and on a recent transatlantic trip was able to hear and enjoy movies perfectly with near-total insulation from surrounding noise. As an unexpected bonus, I've now taken to using them at home to listen to classical music on Youtube – almost as good as being in the concert hall. So, I strongly recommend them.",5,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0

"For years the problem that I have had was finding the right headphones for working out. Due to ear problems having any headphones that stick within my ears was not an option. I have purchased many headphones. Six on our last ones have been “Gripped” headphones. We were attracted to those due to to no sliding off your head that they advertise. The problems with them is that they are cheaply constructed, would fall apart, wires would disconnect, not enough padding in the ears so all the pressure to keep them from sliding hurt our ears. But we couldn’t find anything similar. Well after the last time dealing with them, not receiving our headphones, and not receiving a credit back from them (we had to dispute our credit card charge and the company never returned any of our six plus emails) we decided to move on to find other headphones. That brought us to Cowin E7. They are ok. We use them for Bluetooth at our gym during cardio. The remain of on fine during cardio. The problem is that the audio constantly cracks in and out when connected to the tv on the cardio machines. I have switched to various machines and still have the same problem. I have not had this problem with any other headphone previously. When lifting weights these fall off your head constantly. On many of the machines we have to remove them completely because they are too bulky to fit into the machine.The noise cancellation is ok but does not completely eliminate outside noise but it does an ok job. These headphones are not bad enough to force me back to Gripped Audio headphones, but they do lead me to believe that there must still be something better out there for working out that is reasonably priced.",3,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"The Good: The price, the simplicity of the buttons, and ear padding is comfortable.The Bad: The ear cup shape is on the smaller side and presses on the ear preventing a good seal.

"I am updating my review as the company sent a second set of headphones (unsolicited) after seeing my review.  I have compared the two sets of headphones and the second set are definitely of a better quality.  Didn't have the same issues as the first set of headphones, and volume was noticeably louder (without any crackling).  These are now my go to headphones when I need to go wireless.Their customer service was greatly appreciated, it was a pleasant surprise to come home and see a second set of headphones delivered with a personal note. I will purchase from them again in the future.",4,1,2017-6-21,1,3,0
"The right ear cup is separated on a critical axis, so the right ear cup dangles and will not seal against the ear.The loose fit is uncomfortable, and the failure to isolate the environment defeats the purpose of noise cancellation.",1,1,2019-6-7,1,3,0
"The main downfall of these headphones is just the construction. I gasp for air when I accidentally drop them. They are a little flimsy. But I have dropped them in a number of tough places since I got them 2 months ago and they didn't break sooooo……. I have connectivity issues with my laptop. After about an hour the sound drops off, though still connected. Not sure why that happens. When connected to my phone, these babies literally last all week on one charge. Super awesome! I like listening to music or using them for phone calls. Last complaint is the button configuration. It is on the side and you could accidentally lay your head on the button if you were on an airplane or something like that. and the buttons are configured upside down. The volume up button is positioned on the bottom and down on top. I just use the volume on my phone or connected device to avoid counter intuitive hesitation on which button to press. BUUUT these headphones make you feel immersed with sound and any surround sound effects are fantastic. Noise cancelling works how I think it should. May not be the best but it does block out ambient noise but don't expect it to block out loud clicking sounds or a baby crying. It blocks AMBIENT noise like your air conditioner, or a dishwasher. Still, they muffle other sounds pretty great. With pros and cons I think these deserve a middle ground rating. They really are pretty great for the money. Will probably try out something different next time.",3,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"It's hard to get a constant with music,if you like the song you probably don't overly think about quality. Think earbuds (shutter). I use these mostly for listening to audio books so a poor quality headphone can marr the experience. I had Bose and the quality was excellent but after 7 years the battery connection got unreliable not to mention it used a AAA battery that ran out fast. But I didn't want to spend $400. I took a chance on the Cowin E7 because it had the features I wanted and the price was right. I can say after 1 month these are just as good as Bose. I love the comfort, the weight and of course the sound. I am new to cordless and boy am I happy, I always managed to pull on the cord no matter how careful I was. I did need a little practice using the volume and pause control but I think that will smooth out soon enough. Highly recommended.",5,1,2017-10-8,1,0,0
"So this is my first pair of sound canceling headphones and I gotta say it's pretty cool to hear a low rumble of an AC disappear. Though it does not cancel as much as I would like it to. But after some research I've deduced that active noice cancelation does a worse job than regular noise cancelation, so I guess it's to be expected. Sound quality is great battery life is great even with the noice canceling on. The around the ear pads are a bit small and do not  cover my whole ear which is a little frustrating though I do have big ears. My only real complaint is that when there is an absence of sound while noice canceling is on,(say scrolling Instagram and listening to a video then scrolling further down to a picture) a click is heard. As if someone disconnected your headphones. Not sure if it's a feature to save battery life when not listening to anything but it's pretty annoying. Other than that great headset for the price 4/5 stars",4,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
I took this on the plane for a long haul flight.  I used to have a bose (lost it somewhere) and didn't want to pay another $500 for a headset.  So got this from Amazon. The headset is very comfortable (head it on for over 8 hours flight).  Sound quality was good.  The minus was that it didn't really drown out the noise from the plane.  But you get what you pay for.

I know the splitter works because I can confirm that it works with my old headset. With the Cowin headset, the computer recognizes the input device, and it seems to recognize the input itself as it registers slight electrical ""noise"" from the connection but it does not register any sound that I make. The owner's manual does not address any mic/input troubleshooting, which is surprising to me as I would guess that mic/input issues are common. Disappointed. I hate returns.",1,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"These headphones are designed well, fit well over the ears, and are comfortable even after many hours of usage.  Pairing the headphones to my Smart TV was very simple and very fast.  The sound is clear, especially for voice separation from background noises and music.  The volume control button was challenging at first but, with a little practice, I learned the technique and I can now easily adjust the volume.  The battery has excellent endurance and the headphones beep when the battery gets low, which is helpful.  The headphone's sound and usage matches that of a pair of Sony headphones that cost me four times as much.  Overall, this is a great value for the money, and I would recommend them.",5,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
"Great headphones in an airplane AND to cancel out husbands snoring! Both scenarios were tested! I had a pair of Bose noise cancelling over the head earphones (sorry, i dont know the model #) and these headphones were equal in noise canceling and comfort quality. I let my 12 yo use my Bose, and of course they didn't get returned to me in working order, my fault for letting her use them. I could not justify paying the Bose price for another pair at the moment. These Cowins are amazing! My ears don't get that pressure soreness that a lot of headphones tend to do. The sound quality  is terrific, the noise cancelling is terrific, they. Look good and the charge lasts me forever!",5,1,2019-8-31,1,1,0
"I originally purchased the Mijaer BT25 headphones but had to return them as they were way too big and had very small ear cups. (you can read my review on the Mijaer if your debating between the two) I returned them and purchased the Cowin E7.The Cowin fit great and have more adjustment in the band. The ear cups are very comfortable. I do not think they would fall off if you decided to exercise with them but I do think the weight would be uncomfortable after a while. The noise cancellation works pretty good, although I wished it drowned out voices a bit better. I would recommend buying these if you don't want to spend hundreds on a top of the line set.",5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,1

"I recently had to fly to India for work, and there's a 0% chance that I would have gotten any sleep on the flight without these headphones. The noise-canceling feature completely drowned out the drone of the plane engines, and I could also hear the movies that I watched on the plane without having to crank the volume up. The noise-canceling was no match for the screaming child in front of me, but when I put some music on low in addition to the noise-canceling, it was quiet enough that I could sleep. I'm not looking forward to my next long flight, but I'll hate it less thanks to these headphones.",5,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0

"It good headphones, comfy, I can use it for hours without ears hurting but this varies from person to person. Batteries last +4 hours for my purpose of use on computer. Not much use on volume controls. Wireless is wire hassle free. The active noise canceling is very good.Only con would be the low battery beeping will still continue even when charging while you use it if the battery is below the threshold. Because of this I would need to turn off the headphones until it is above the threshold to stop the beeping. Possible if they can stop the beeping if it detects a charging source (only tested on the usb not the 3.5mm headjack)?",5,1,2017-7-24,1,1,0
"I had read many good reviews on these headphones.  I was hoping to use these as I continue to work from home during the quarantine. Set up is easy, headphones are made of good quality - the noise cancelling leaves something to be desired, the sound is decent and the fit is comfortable even with glasses.But my main issue with them is that the mic never worked.  I tried several troubleshooting steps on my own with no success.  I emailed Cowin and they responded quickly. But their response was basically - yeah we know the mics don't work that well for every day use.  Please return, so I did.",2,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"Received these as a gift.  These are excellent for the price.  The Noise canceling is good, so far.  The real test will be in spring when I mow the lawn (will update).  I typically use my wife's HiFi Elite Super 66, over the ear headphones.  These feel and sound just as good, if not better, but the E7 has active noise cancelling. The blue tooth has a very long connectivity range to electronic devices before they disconnect.  They can be used as corded headphones, bluetooth headphones, stand alone (no device) active noise canceling, or bluetooth headphones with active noise canceling.  The on-off-noise canceling control is a simple three-way toggle making it idiot proof.  The battery last so long I have yet to need to recharge them.  Excellent Buy.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I had never had noise cancelling headphones before these. As far as that goes, I'd say it is sufficient enough for any day-to-day silencing. With music on and the noise cancelling active it would very easily cancel out all but the most obstructive of sounds such as loud conversation or something along those lines. The sound quality is great. I do believe that the highs do have a limitation as when I used them for studio guitar they would clip sometimes from the harshness of the tone, but fully produced music is fantastic, with good mids and surprisingly thick low end/base. They are immensely comfortable to wear, with the material they use being soft and non-irritating to the skin. I haven't had the chance to ever try out high-end headphones like Sony or Bose, but for the price I think these are a fantastic set, perfect for traveling and work environments when you're trying to focus.",5,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
"I bought these specifically to use an airplane trips.  Long distance ones.  First time I used them was Newark to Amsterdam.  The charge lasted the whole trip.  When I used them without noise cancelling, then turned on noise cancelling, there was a big difference.  The price was great for the use they will get.  First pair of noise cancelling I ever bought.  That is the main reason I bought them.  10 hour trip back...charge held through the whole flight.  Not the best for sound quality but for the price gave me what I needed.  Probably will use only on a plane.",5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
"I had a pair of Solo Beats (that I got for free when buying my laptop) that I didn't like because they sat on top of my ears which hurt and I didn't find the sound quality to be all that great. I also had issues syncing between different devices.My rating is based on an informal comparison of experience with the beats and these Cowin E7 headphones. 1) the price is really competitive compared to other wireless over the ear headphones 2) these things were very easy to sync with my mac and iphone (just be sure to flip the switch to bluetooth to connect and unsync them from one device before switching to the other I think that works best) 3) the sound quality is really good compared to the Solo Beats, I was watching a movie on my laptop and it felt like surround sound. One negative thing is that the sound is slightly loud outside of the headphones if you have the volume up on medium to high, meaning others can probably hear what you are listening to. I used them at the airport and on the plane for a particularly stressful travel situation and the battery life is really good. I gave these a 4-star because I still feel like they hurt my ears a bit like they are over the ear but maybe just over the ear, after many hours they do feel a bit painful (like if you're on a cross country plane ride like I was). I don't have large ears so not sure what that is about. Now I just avoid having them on for many hours.",4,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0

"Here was my original review: These were ok. The noise canceling was decent but then it started doing this warbling noise.The company was very kind and sent me a replacement pair at no cost. They told me these were updated. Oh my word they are heads above better than they were. The bass is so much better and the warbling is almost non-existent. Last time, if I moved around too much it did it. Now if I push the ear coverings against my head with the noise canceling engaged, it warbles. But easy fix, don't push them. The blutooth connection is better than the direct connection which is surprising. The blutooth connection is legit! Thank you for working on the product. I might have to buy one for my wife now.",5,1,2017-9-19,1,1,0
"The sound quality is good, but I find them a little quiet. The sound cancellation works ok, but I can hear constant fast beeping in the background. Also one of my biggest issues with this is that if I put them on even just a little louder, the sound leaks outside. I can't even put on more than 30% volume otherwise people around me can hear what I'm hearing just as clearly! Might as well not wear any headphones.To add on to that,the bluetooth keeps disconnecting even though there are no background processes running on my device other than whatever is using the audio output.",2,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0

These headphones allow me to move around the apartment and still listen to my radio. Even if I'm doing something loud like vacuuming, I can still hear everything in the headphones. I can also take phone calls on the headphones (calls I'd usually miss because I was away from whoever my phone was). The color (red) is bright and fun and I'm very happy with them.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"These headphones are a great value with excellent quality. They give you 95% of the quality you get from the expensive Bose headphones, for a fraction of the price. The sound quality is very good. It doesn’t “wow” you as much as the Bose do, and the design and functionality is not as elegant as the Bose, but on its own it is a great value and an excellent set of headphones. Unless you are a wealthy audiophile who must have the very, very best, these provide almost the same quality as their Bose counterpart for a reasonable price.

I ordered it yesterday and it was delivered today!",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
I’m not sure where all these good reviews came from. The noise cancellation is absolutely sub-par. Could not even block out the hum of air coming in through the vents in my own home - absolutely would do nothing against the noise of an airplane.

"So,  I originally purchased these headphones the 6th of July.  The immediate thing I noticed is these are SUPER noise cancelling.  The sound quality is great, especially for what you pay for.  It's got pretty great bass. I really liked these headphones.Unfortunately,  for whatever reason,  the headphones started making this God awful screeching noise.  At first I thought it was because I was outside the range of my cellphone,  bit it happened constantly while my headphones were in my pocket.",4,1,2019-7-24,1,0,1

"I saw these suggested on a gamer gurl website and the person showed herself wearing them. They are stylish, comfy and it is so silent when nothing is broadcasting into them. My saftey earmuffs were not that good! I am a largetall person, but I have small hands and feet(size 7) and head (without accommodating hair when long- size 7). Most headphones I ever bought (My Sennheiser, my beloved Logitech G930, my meh sloppy Senty and the current Sades) end up literally hanging off my ears or simply falling off altogether after the first week I own them. I usually wear a ski bonnet to keep them on when gaming.  THESE... have a professional appearance, fold neatly without having to fight or force which would hasten their demise. The Muff cushioning is pliant and soft and doesn't feel cheap or make you sweat. For mid-range priced headset and for women this is a purchase you will not regret. The range seems good but I have not really tested it out. I used to go to the store across the street with my G930s <_<",5,1,2019-5-17,1,0,1
"Theses headphones are a good value. They are reasonably comfortable, and the sound quality good. The user's manual and the product description state that the noise cancellation is only good at eliminating low frequency noises, but not sounds like human voices. They do indeed eliminate low frequency noise, things like fans and road/aircraft noise.  The noise cancellation does affect the low frequency sound quality.Based on the features and price range of the product, I'd give it 3 to 4 stars. However, the seller contacted me about my review and offered to upgrade, replace, or refund me for the product. With the good customer service, I'd put the overall rating at 4 to 5 stars.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,1,0

Be careful: I thought all E7 phones were active noise cancelling. I learned the hard way they are not. First set was not noise cancelling. I sent an email to customer service asking if there was anyway I could exchange them - NO REPLY, despite their claim in product literature to contact them with any question or problem. I ended up just returning them and ordering the noise cancelling. Hoping I won't have to rely on customer service.",4,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"UPDATE: Unfortunately, they broke. Where the ear cup meets the head band, they swivel, but do not fold. There is a plastic post that sits in a hole to allow the swivel, and that union broke. It's probably my fault, just be careful.Original Review: These headphones are about what I would expect for this price level. I got them on sale on prime day. The noise cancelling feature works pretty well, but significantly reduces the quality of the music playing. For me it isn't worth the noise reduction. I wish they sounded a little clearer and folded, but for forty bucks I can't complain too much. Comfortable so far, will be testing long term comfort on a twelve hour flight this weekend. Still looking for my perfect pair.",4,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

"I have to admit, I was somewhat skeptical and leery of purchasing these headphones. It was an off-brand that I had never heard but the reviews were good. I now understand why. For the price, these are very nice headphones. The sound quality is very good and they are well constructed. They feel very sturdy and well built and look good as well. They are comfortable to wear. The noise cancellation is OK, not as good as Bose but they are 1/5 the price and work well enough for my needs. I would not hesitate recommending these headphones to anyone.",5,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"I listen to pretty much every genre of music from time to time. And for certain things, like indie rock, electronic, and hip hop music, these headphones sound fantastic. I'm not great with technical terms to describe sound, but they have a very deep sound, where you can hear multiple layers in the music you probably wouldn't be able to with earbuds. I'm usually pleasantly surprised with these genres. Which brings me to the genre I probably listen to the most often, metal. I don't why this is, but metal overall just doesn't sound that good in these headphones. Metal is a genre that demands to be played at the loudest possible volume, and when I attempt that with these, I am still left wanting more. It pretty much isn't possible to turn them up to a level where the music is uncomfortably loud. And that can end up leaving a lot to be desired. I'm sure if I did have technical knowledge I could describe more accurately why these end up sounding pretty flat when I try to listen to metal on them, but I lack that knowledge. So all I can say is that if metal is your primary genre, you might find yourself a little disappointed.That being said, overall they are great headphones, especially for the price. They usually connect really easily, are comfortable my head/ears for hours at a time, and seem to stay charged forever. And I sometimes like to listen to rain sounds while trying to go to sleep. Listen to 8d rain videos on youtube through these is pretty incredible. It really tricks my brain into thinking I'm right there in the middle of the storm. So overall I don't have any major complaints and am satisfied with my purchase, I just wish they had a little bit more range.",3,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
it's a nice headset to have if you buy it to listen to music or connect it to some gaming station. They look lil bulky though but NC and bass effect is too good.Bluetooth connects very well too. But i was disappointed by the microphone as the audio gets muffled and people at other end don't hear very clear. You have to speak a lil loud to it to make your voice audible at other end.  So not a good choice if you think of using it to attend the meetings or something like that.,2,1,2020-7-25,1,2,0
"I bought the headphones for my wife. She has been extremely pleased with the headphones after using it for several days. This is a simple connection to her phone or iPad and the wireless range is quite a lot longer. The ear cups fit around her ears and have a soft feel to them there is a lot of cushions the headphones don't put pressure on the head. She wears them for hours at a time with no problems. The sound quality is excellent and noise-canceling is great, blocking out almost all the background noise. Battery life seems pretty good, have been able to listen to them for several hours without having to recharge them. If you love listening to music in your spare time or you travel very often.

The headphones are very good for the price.  The sound is clear and they hold a charge for a long time.  I have yet to run them out of power and have used for 10-15 hours between charging.  The first one I received had the rotating bracket on the left side break about 3 months after receiving it (I have kind of a big head so have to stretch out to get over my noggin).  I finally got around to calling customer service and they sent out a replacement within days.  Just be careful grabbing the earpiece to get them over your head and grab above the rotating brackets or you might find the same issue.  I'll see how that goes and try and update if this does the trick or if this set ends up with a similar issue down the road.,4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Sometimes you dont get what you pay for.  My daughter's Beats Studio Bluetooth headphones would no longer charge and there was no way I was going to pay the huge $$$ to replace them only to get broken again.  I found these and figured the price was right - so I bought them.  I just hooked them up and tried them out and can honestly say they sound better than the Beats.  On the power switch there is a middle selection between ""off"" and ""BT"" which is the bass boost feature that doesnt seem to be well documented in the setup.  On this setting they are amazing!  I would recommend these to a friend.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones to use while running the lawn tractor. They reduce the mower sound to barely present. The ideal thing is that they have a Bluetooth to my cell phone, enabling me to listen to my favorite music while working. And as an added bonus I can take an incoming phone call with the built in microphone. They are very light weight and I have listened for a full days work with no power problems.

From fully charged until the battery dies they register as 90%. I get well over 12 hours of playback (we'll see how well the battery ages) between charges but I'm never quite sure when they will die and need recharging.

I also appreciate the warranty that comes with them.",4,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
These are truly great headphones at this price point.  It sounds like you are right in the concert hall and there is no annoying background noise or static like on cheaper headphones. it is pure sound.  You can still hear some background sound if there is any but the headphones are so good that you don't really pay attention to the background noise.  I would wholeheartedly recommend these headphones to anyone.  My only beef is that the USB cord is too short for wearing them and listening to music while the headphones recharge. Its a small annoyance but I would have preferred a longer recharging cord.The reviewer is the author of the Kindle book entitled: SEX EDUCATION FOR ADULTS SECRETS TO,5,1,2019-3-17,1,0,0

After contacting customer service they quickly provided a new replacement free of charge, which I got in February this year. I have been happy with it ever since, using it almost daily. Sound quality is excellent, the headphones are snug and comfortable (able to wear them for hours without feeling fatigue).

I was really excited to get these but should have listened to the other bad reviews. I opened the box and immediately realized these felt very cheap. I read the directions then put them on. The power button was very lose and the volume didn’t work at all. Plus my husband could hear the music like I was playing it right out in the open! What is the point of head phones if they don’t contain the sound at all. These are immediately going back. I have $30 ones that work much better than these.,2,1,2019-11-23,1,1,0
I couldn't stand trying to watch TV in the evening while the kids were asleep and worrying if they could hear it or not. I love these. They are super easy to connect/set up and hold a charge well. They are sturdy and look like they will last a long time.Update***,5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones to replace another brand of similar type. These are so much more comfortable than the previous pair, and the sound quality is just as good or maybe better than the higher priced product they replaced. While I'm not an audiophile, I have sent back headphones that sounded tinny; these have a nice bass to them and I'm pleased with the sound quality on both music and podcasts. The noise cancelling mode works as well as the numerous pairs I've had. The over the ear style definitely works better for this purpose. I can recommend these headphones.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"These were the first set of over-the-ear headphones I have ever purchased or used so I must say that I have no other experience to compare these to.  Having said that, I can say that considering the purchase price and the product I feel I have received good value for the money spent.  The sound quality is good and they function as I expected they would.  I purchased these to use while traveling and for use around the house allowing me to listen to my preferred music without disrupting other activities going on around me and to diminish the disruption to my listening pleasure.  I am please with my purchase.",4,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
"You can’t beat these headphones for this price. They’re comfortable and the sound is great. I’m primarily using them to watch videos for school and to listen to music or audiobooks around the house and on walks. I’m not snobby about things like this, so I can’t get technical. I’m not blasting music on them, either. Just listening at a normal volume. I would buy them again in a heartbeat. The noise canceling is just ok, but it does make a noticeable difference. It’s not going to drown out tons of loud noise, but it works when I’m working on the couch while someone is watching TV or if the neighbors are throwing a loud party.",5,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0
"I really like these headphones. The sound quality is great and they aren't too heavy to wear for long periods of time. They aren't as noise cancelling as I would like. I wore them on New Year's Eve to drown out the noise of the fireworks and barking dogs and they only muted it a little, but just putting your music on loud will do that. They do cancel low frequency noises like air purifiers or fans, but I was hoping for comple noise cancelling. I suppose that makes some sense considering the price. Overall I would buy them again and would recommend them.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"These are amazingly comfortable. The active noise suppression works very well, considering the price point. With suppression on, you will notice that the audio quality changes a bit, this is no doubt the result of the drivers doing two tasks at once.Bass response becomes a bit softer, and midrange level rises a bit. I would venture that this is due to the active suppression feeding an additional signal to the speakers. Overall, you will be impressed with the sound quality.",5,1,2018-1-2,1,0,0
"If you are looking for nice looking headphones then these are for you.  I purchased the purple set and have gotten a lot of compliments.  The problem is I was looking for headphones with noise cancellation and these are not it.  Very disappointing.  I would probably return but I have already thrown away the box, rookie mistake.  The sound is good, so that is a plus and they are not uncomfortable.  They do hold a good charge.So the take if you are using them solely not to disturb others with your music, etc... you may like these.  If you need to block-out outside noise I say save your money.",2,1,2019-6-21,1,1,0
"I bought an entry level pair of over-ear Bluetooth headphones, which stopped working in under a year. Then I got a mid-range pair to replace them, and they started falling apart after about 14 months. I finally decided to get a set of nicer headphones, and the E7s seemed too good to be true - great reviews at an affordable price?Well, it's true. The sound quality on these is a noteworthy improvement on the previous sets. The ANC is good enough to drown out city street noise when I'm downtown, and the volume is a lot louder than any previous sets I've used. The tactile power switch and volume/track buttons make them simple to operate, and the Bluetooth connects quickly and consistently. There are no external wires from the ears to the headpiece to get caught on anything. And they are comfortable - a good weight, but not heavy.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I’ve had these headphones for almost a week now. They are great! I’ve used them outside in chilly Wisconsin temperatures while I’m doing livestock chores ( listening to audiobooks or podcasts, while working out, & in my office. The sound quality is great, they are extra comfortable with the ear room the offer and really great padding. I’ve used them probably 10+ hours now collectively and still haven’t had to recharge them yet. They do say right in the description it will not cancel out talking noise but it does do an excellent job cancelling out the noise from my elliptical or rowing machine. They are pretty! I’ve also used them to make phone calls and the audio comes through & goes through clearly. Very impressed with the overall quality!  Also they don’t hurt my head like other pairs have!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"We bought these because we travel frequently and are often needing to work in noisy environments. The ANC feature works well and the sound quality is quite good for the price. The Bluetooth connection is solid and we rarely have trouble with it even in crowded areas. The built in mic works well for video conferencing and voice calls although occasionally it will pick up more of the background noise than our voice. They are also very comfortable to wear, even for longer periods, such as watching movies, conference calls, etc. While I can’t really compare to other higher priced headphones, I do feel these have delivered good quality at a very affordable price.",4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"UPDATE: Manufacturer sent me a newer unit, the E8, and performance is much better. Changing to 4 stars.Sound quality is decent considering the price point. The noise canceling mode is poor at best. When activated it causes a type of sensitivity in the headphones where they make an electric squeaking noise within the ear speakers if the slightest pressure is applied to the outside of the ear piece. Obviously this is totally impractical. They’re also pretty heavy and can bother after a while. Price point is tempting but not great performance.",4,1,2019-2-20,1,1,0
"So i bought these a month back after scouring through comments and reviews, upon opening the box the smell of spraypaint? hit me shrugged it off its typical new product stuff I attempted to connect them shortly after to my computer after following countless guides shutting off the adapter resetting it nothing worked and I gave up so I just plugged them in.After a week or so of using them for gaming / streaming I noticed a small popping and fading in my right ear I mostly ignored this for the following week skip forward to this week and even sitting still this fading popping and even the sound cutting out completely happens when sitting still im fed up after paying $60 for Amazons reccomended product just for it to fizzle out in less than a month.

"For a budget pair of over the ear head phones, these are comfortable, sound great, and the mic works really well.  I have not used this device heavily, however in the last three months I have been using it every day (as I was working from home).  During this time, the left ear piece broke off from the head band (there are multiple pics in other reviews showing this).  I contacted customer service about this issue, and their response time and resolution were fantastic.  After they sent me a replacement unit, I took a closer look at the ear piece that fell off.  I was able to “fix” the broken unit using copper wire (see pic). Not ideal, but the unit still functions but will not fold up to fit in the original bag for travel.",4,1,2020-7-5,1,1,1
"I got these to use as a headset for making calls at work with my computer. The mic is apparently ok since some people receive my voice loud and clear while others say I sound muffled. On the receiving end, though, people sound slightly muffled as well. It is not the best experience since I got these primarily to use for work calls. I haven't tested these just for listening to music or movies, but I have a feeling they are probably better for that kind of use.",2,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
"Completely cancels the outside noise while listening music or watching a movie/show on your computer. Haven't tried yet but must be great during air travels too since it is great cancelling outside noise while listening your own movie or music. My husband and I both put this on while watching same YouTube video and both of us couldn't hear what the other one was saying in the mean time. However I gave four stars cause, it doesn't significantly reduces outside noise while not listening/playing anything. If you are buying this to cancel outside noise to study or focus on some reading etc. without a music on in the background, I wouldn't recommend. Otherwise it is great!",4,1,2019-2-12,1,0,0
"I knew going in that at this price point, noise cancelling wouldn’t be great. And I was right. In fact, I detect zero difference from when I switch to noise cancelling on the head phones and unfortunately can still hear my neighbors stomping around above me. That said, they are super comfortable and the sound quality is great. I previously had cheap ear buds and listening to songs with these headphones have been eye opening. My one gripe with these is that is super inconvenient to switch between devices. I don’t know if it’s the headphones or some issue with Apple products, but in order to connect to my laptop, I have to go in and disconnect on my iPad (to which it was previously paired). Overall a fairly mild inconvenience because I need to remember to disconnect before I go somewhere with only one device.In short - good headphones for sound quality, but pretty meh on noise cancelling. I’d say the only noise cancelling I get is from the comfortable seal of the headphones over my ears.",4,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"Due to the price of $48... I was skeptical at best. I travel 48 out of 52 weeks for work, but couldn't stomach spending $200+ on a set of BT headphones. I got them prime at my hotel and d charged them for the rest of the after noon. I hooked them up (easily) to my Surface laptop a d watched a movie. Unbelievable great sound. I then hooked them up to my Samsung  note 9 (easily) and melted away into some good acoustic music.The range that they have acoustically is amazing, and really allow you to melt into what you are listening to.",5,1,2018-12-3,1,0,0
Updated review: After posting my previous review the seller contacted me. They replaced the item at no cost. Since receiving it I’ve had no issues.

"I am 65 and my hearing does not block out the background noise.  Therefore it is harder for me to hear what is in front of me, like the TV.  I cannot believe the clarity and quality of sound I can now hear with these headphones.  I have been listening to music with all brands of earbuds.  The music no longer had the POP, the feel I was so used to years ago.  I put these phones on, turn on my operas and almost cried!!  THIS IS THE WAY TO LISTEN to music.  I used the wire/not wireless to listen to my TV at night to drown out all the background noise -- amazing.  I have answered the phone with them on, crystal clear, microphone worked great.  I have nothing but praise for these headphones.",5,1,2017-5-19,1,2,0
Perfect inexpensive headphones for grad students like myself- noise is a big distraction for me while I'm studying but these head phones have allowed me to study more effectively out in public. The sound quality is good and the range allows me to walk throughout my average-sized apartment while still being connected to my laptop in the other room. Pairs well with my iPhone and Dell laptop. Does not 100% cancel out all noise but does muffle background noise well and is comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. A small piece did break from one of the ear pieces (I'd recommend purchasing the case with the headphones if you'll be traveling outside your home with them) but Cowin was incredibly helpful by fulfilling their warranty promise and replacing the pair for me hassle-free.,5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"Picked these up when I was looking for bluetooth headphones that had decent noise canceling function. I've got a decent sized yard, and using regular headphones (earbuds) only worked when I jacked the volume up on my mp3 player (cuz I'm old school and had an mp3 player). I got these, hooked 'em up to my shiny new iPhone, and gave 'em their trial run today. Worked great! I don't have to have the volume up so high to drown out the lawnmower, and I can still hear the music just fine. I'd say they were the perfect headphones for mowing if they weren't just so darn pretty...",5,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0
"These had two issues that made them useless to me. First, they will not connect to a device that doesn't provide a means to select a Bluetooth device - they will not connect to a Bluetooth adapter/transceiver or TV. You can only use these with a mobile device like a Smart cell phone that, in the settings area, lets you select a Bluetooth device. Without such a settings function they will not connect to your device. Second, you cannot charge them and listen at the same time. It's either charge or listen, not both.",2,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I am not very savvy with electronics, but I wanted to get reasonably priced noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones mostly for traveling. After reading the product description and reviews on Amazon, I decided to give these headphones a try. They were packaged very securely and arrived very quickly. The headphones look and operate at a quality standpoint far above the modest cost. After charging them for several hours, they were extremely easy to establish a Bluetooth connection with our smartphone. They are very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is far superior to what I was expecting. I could not be more happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I've had this for a year now and I've really enjoyed it.  Bluetooth + noise cancellation is my main usage, either listening to podcasts or even listening to nothing, if I'm on the train.  It tones down train noise a lot, and with the help of music makes working in my loud office environment bearable.  With music it's better to not activate the noise cancellation as it messes with the sound, and music makes it noticeable.  The battery lasts me over a week's use of about 35-40 hours, but I keep a spare micro USB at my desk to spot charge if I've used it more than expected.And you better keep it from running out of batteries.  It can play music while off with the aux cable, but if you're using the bluetooth or noise cancellation while the battery is low it has an incessant chime every 30 seconds letting you know, *even if it's charging*.  Learn how long it takes to run down the battery and never let it happen.",4,1,2018-3-13,1,0,0
"We purchased 2 of these headphones and are very please with them. They have a smooth sound, good bass and are comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. One thing I'd love to see as an option is an intercom option where you can link up two headphones so when both people are wearing them we can chime in to say something to each other instead of scaring the person you're trying to get the attention of.Overall we are both very pleased with the purchase. Looking forward to seeing how they hold up over the years.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"This is a revised review, my last one was just 3 stars - because I could not get the mic to work: Today I received a ""Letter of Apology"", THIS IS WAS NOT EXPECTING! With a new head set. I was so impressed, because in today's world, it seems once most companies get your money they are done with you. Well the Cowin Team could not accept 3 stars, so in good faith, I dropped what I was doing (Owner of a Security Guard Company) and tested this unit again.To my joy - they worked great! just like I expected - fits great !!!  Thank you so much, please send me the return information, and I will send the others back. I do not want ANYTHING for free, but love ;-)  Ken",5,1,2017-8-14,1,1,0
The batteries only lasted 3 and a half months.  Almost as soon as the return window closed these headphones would no longer hold a charge.  I hope the manufacture will improve the battery life as these would be a keeper.,2,1,2020-6-30,1,2,0
"I purchased these almost a year ago and have really enjoyed using them. Recently we required a headset with microphone at work for Microsoft Teams. Tech Support  and spent hours trying to figure out why the microphone showed up on some apps but not on all and didn't seem to work. After contacting tech support I was disappointed to learn that the microphone only works when connected by bluetooth. In my particular work environment we are not able to use bluetooth.

"I've gone through a lot of bluetooth headsets that always seem to find a way to break in a few months (including the 2018 version of these, unfortunately, but I covered the subject in that review). These lasted a couple years, and only broke when they did because I wasn't very careful with them. Well-made and sturdy.Excellent audio quality, and the noise cancelling is fantastic. I have very sensitive hearing, and these block out nearly all annoying background noise while still letting me hear people talking to me. I might still need to take them off to hear clearly if there's other nosie, but I won't miss someone getting my attention. Great for going out on walks, or being in crowded stores. Or sitting in an apartment with a very loud TV next door.",5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
"These headphones really do have a great sound. Full disclosure though- I have not owned or tried another pair of these kinds of headphones to compare against. Still, I am very pleased with sound quality and battery life. The problem with these are the clips that holds the earpiece together. My right earpiece came apart. The plastic inside seemed to have worn out enough to release the clips after only a few months. I contacted support and they responded immediately and sent me a code for a new pair. For that reason I am giving them five stars since I appreciate great customer support and I love the headphones overall.By the way...you can do a simple home repair for this issue. On the earpiece there is a cover glued on to hide the clips. Just get a small screwdriver and peal that off carefully so you can put it back on when you are done. Then take a paper clip and cut it down to about 1/2 inch or so. Bend it into a ""C"" shape and shove it in while holding the headphones together. I used a screwdriver to jam in there good and tight. The paper clip will hold everything together better than new. Put the cover back on and you are good to go.",5,1,2019-1-9,1,1,1
"*Update - Cowin reached out to me and was able to provide a very comfortable pair of headphones that didn't fall off my head.  Lisa, with customer service, was very helpful.  The new pair fit perfectly and have great noise cancelling capability.These headphones are decent quality but they are big and bulky. They stick off your ears quite a bit. And the over the head portion is too big for my head. They fall off all the time so I don’t even use them anymore (I have a rather large head, so this shouldn’t be an issue). I wouldn’t recommend for this reason alone.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"It's overall very good.  I sometimes wear them just for noise cancellation.The only thing that is weird is the + / - buttons.  Single press will seek to a new track, Long press controls volume.  Ok, can get used to that... trying to reduce buttons on wireless headphones seems to be the trend.  BUT the ""+"" is oriented on the bottom, ""-"" is oriented on the top.

"I love these headphones. They're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The sound quality is excellent and setting the Bluetooth up was easy. The other pairs of wireless headphones I've had all had an annoying crackle in the background unless I plugged them in with a cord, but the sound is clear and crisp without a hint of static. I'm impressed with the quality so far, especially since they weren't that expensive. I've used them for about 2-3 hours a day for a few days, and the battery charge has held up fine.

They fit so comfortably on my ear, and I don't have to worry about my wires getting tangled or yanked, since it's wireless.

I have bought headphones at my local department stores, and these are better than what I have picked up before. I haven't used them during travel yet, but I feel like I could use them during long flights and actually be able to sleep with them on.

Now, granted, these may not sound ""quite"" as good as Bose, but,  at 65 bucks,  they're a whole lot less expensive, for a really great listening experience. I would suggest these to anyone who appreciates good quality sound. Maybe not a true audiophile,  but, for me, they do all i ask of them. Excellent value, comfortable, long listening time,  great build quality, all for a very reasonable price. Why choose anything else?",5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
For the money great headset. The thing that i think makes this headset a bit unique is it's very lightweight. i can workout in the gym doing ellipticals or run 8 mph on treadmill or do Jacobs ladder and this headset stays on Rock solid and blocks the annoying crap music with deep bass they play in the gyms. Highly recommend this headset if the deep bass garbage music they play in gyms annoys you. the head set is bulky though but i don't care what people think about having a giant head set on. they can kiss it.,5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"I wanted a pair of headphones that were Bluetooth and completely wireless (not the style that have the earpieces wired together) - these fit that perfectly. They paired to an iPhone effortlessly another plus. My primary use is audio book listening and the sound quality for this and an occasional phone call is excellent. I have used them on cold winter walks of 10 miles and they work though my knit cap, cover the entire ear so they actually help keep me warm and the battery has lasted for 3 hours of solid use in 10 degree temperatures.

"Considering the price, I went into this with low expectations.  In fact, these are excellent headphones.  The materials used feel substantial, and are very comfortable.  They look well made too.  The sound quality is excellent, with low bass and crisp highs.  The volume is louder than I could imagine you would need in any normal environment.  I work in a fairly noisy area, and the combination of noise cancelling, and moderate volume, blocks nearly all sounds outside the headphones.  I have used hearing protection in very noisy environments, and would like to point out that over the ear headphones, in an ideal set up, can only drop the noise levels about 28db.  I have read other reviews that speculated more expensive headphones could block more sound than these.  I would be shocked if there were any tangible improvement by another product.  I believe that the tension required for a better seal around the ears would make them uncomfortable, and that is the only thing I could imagine that would block any more sound than these headphones do now.  I have been wearing these headphones for 4 - 6 hours a day for the last week, and they are very comfortable.  I have yet to recharge them.  I wholeheartedly recommend these headphones, as they are excellent.",5,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0

They are quality build and perform admirably but the dynamics of the sound fall well short of my Sony's.  They also appear to be larger in size when you view them online.  They noise cancellation is quite good and the based delivery is also.  They do not have the dynamics of staging and full range of my Sony's.  These are price significantly less that my Sony’s I should have auditioned them before the purchased.  The listen teat tells all.

"I'm a former gaming addict, so I used to buy the latest and greatest by Turtle Beach and Triton. For me, sound clarity and ease of use are the top 2 key aspects to a quality pair of headphones, and yet the 3rd must be the sound immersion. However, the E7s bass is too low to be considered high on the immersion charts; although, for the price it'd be hard to top the sound clarity.This was my first pair of bluetooth headphones specifically purchased for my phone and computer. For what it's worth, I love being able to move freely around my home office without worrying about stumbling over a wire. However, being more specific to these headphone, the sound is nice and crisp when connecting to my computer, and yet seems to lack the same luster when connected to my phone.

Otherwise, these are a great 'budget' option.>The noise cancelling is almost non-existent compared with just putting the headphones over my ears. They obviously block out some sound, but switching to the noise cancelling dampens speaking noise very little.

They sent me a new one thinking it was defective. The new one does it too, that's just how they are. The sound quality is great and if you don't like the N.C. mode you can turn it off and the sound quality is still really good, and it doesn't disturb those surrounding you. After a few months of use I'd say I like it. I flew on a plane recently and the N.C. mode actually drowned out the sound of the engines. So it works, but if you jog or move around a lot its best to keep it off N.C. mode. Unless you're flying on a plane or recording in a studio, who really needs noise cancellation anyway.",4,1,2018-4-28,1,1,0
"Granted I have never lived a privelidged life, but folks this is the first time I have ever heard the words to songs. I had no idea there was a delivery method so crisp and subtile that I could actually hear what the singer was saying with rock music blaring in the background. I have heard of people paying $500 for a set of head phones and bragging about it, so I knew there was something available that was better than I had experienced, but for $60, I never dreamed I could experience something this special. I am sure there is something out there better. I am equally sure I am never going to convince myself to pay whatever it costs to experience it. If you are looking for some really nice bluetooth headphones for a really nice price, these are them. Also comes in a very nice package. Solid box with a leather bag inside. One thing slightly negative. If you plan to use them pluged in, say when the battery needs charging, you need to buy a cord. It does not come with one.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"I hate to write a review about this my hearing is very bad I am not sure that I can do this justice. I have not cranked these up yet but do seem to have more volume than I would like, the bass I feel is adequate. I know I used these several times a couple of hours each day then I failed to turn off for maybe twelve to eighteen hours, when I did use them again there was no problem. I have never paired anything before and this was quite easy. I have had alot of enjoyment from these and I would most definitely buy again. I do not know if the noise canceling works, I was getting noise in not trying to keep it out",5,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones so that I could get some quiet time in my house and either read a book in silence, watch Netflix without disturbing my wife, or listen to classic rock using my iPod.  So far, so good.  Put the headphones on, and blissful silence, when I need it, or great sound quality when watching Netflix or listening to my iPod; without any discomfort from wearing the headsets for hours, as the foam padding makes them very comfortable.  Additionally, headphones look like they are very well made and come with a great long warranty.  Would recommend this product highly.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"This product came in a very sleek box.  Upon opening it up, I found the nice, leather case for the headphones.  I then looked through the literature included.  Very helpful! Finally, I got to the product itself.  After reading the instructions, I connected the Cowin E7 Wireless Headphones to my Samsung phone, turned on my favorite Pandora program, and BAM! - instant music.  The next morning I did my daily walk on the treadmill.  The noise cancellation feature effectively reduced the unwanted noise of the treadmill and gave me an incredible experience of music.  This was a fabulous purchase!",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"This is the best- hands down- set of headphones I have ever owned. My brother likes to boast about his ""Beats"" headphones, at a cost 4-5 times higher than these COWIN E7 phones.

"Update to my review, I purchased these in Sept. 2019, here it is Aug. 2020, so just short of a year I have found a vulnerable, weak-link in the product.  I know you don't know me, but trust me when I say I am gentle, I take pride in keeping items for a long long time.  So, two evenings ago I was watching TV with the earphones on, I took them off, laid them down and a few minutes later picked them up to put them back on, the right ear cup had broken off of the frame and was just dangling there.  Now, the ear cups are designed to swivel, to get a better wearer experience I guess.  Well, the little connector pin broke, thereby yielding the earphones useless.  So, back to the ordering game, trying to figure out a better, more solid brand that will hold up longer.  GKMy only issue with the headphones is that they need to adjust a little bit bigger. While the ear cups do fit over my ears, I would like to have had about a 1/4"" to 1/2"" more adjustable room for a slightly for a more comfortable fit.  The quality of the headset is great, the Bluetooth connectivity was easy to set up and works well.  I use them for listening to the TV so as not to bother anyone else in the house and also to listen to music via apps on my phone.  Overall very satisfied with these and would recommend them to others.",4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"I like the way the headphones fit. They kinda disappear on my head and over my ears. Unnoticeable as they should be. Sounds very good. That's coming from someone who loves music and has been a professional musician. The sound reduction is noticeable yet unpretentious. The little blue glow on the outside of the earphones is kinda cool. Same color blue as the eyes of the leaders of the Whitelings. The material feels quality and the sound is very good and the fit is nice. Other than that, I won't say anymore about these fine yet humble headphones.",5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"I like the feel of these, they look great, and the sound is really good. However, the ear cups connections to the headband are really cheap and both sides of mine broke, I have had to tape them together.I would rate my usage as light, I only use these on my desk at work to occasionally watch a video, so these may sit for days without being touched. But after two years I have had to tape them together. Luckily I work in a small office so not too many people are making fun of me.",2,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
I honestly really wanted to like these headphones.Let me start out by saying that I've used these for over a month now. It's very sturdy and made a really good materials. The battery life is awesome and these headphones are very stylish and pretty. Here's the complaints I have with them...,3,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"The product has performed flawlessly. I had to use an inexpensive Bluetooth plug and play Bluetooth adapter because I have an 8.1 OS, but to my surprise, the thing is working exceptionally well. I like the freedom of being able to walk around my workroom and not be tethered to the computer. It, also, works with my tablet and my S7 cellphone.  I have not tried to have both the cellphone and any other unit connected to the earphones together yet. Try them you will like the Cowin E7 headphones.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"Been giving these a good bit of use over the last few months, and I gotta say I'm quite satisfied with the product.  However I would warn away those looking for headsets specifically to use with the Discord application.  I ended up not being able to find a configuration where everything worked while remaining wireless.  However its my understanding that it was related to limitations of Windows 10 and Discord specifically using bluetooths limited bandwidth to multitask.  Given that I'm not holding it against the headset design.For games, music, or TV/movie the sound quality and range is on point and likely beat out any earbud until you get into the real high end audiophile stuff.  There are tons of over-the-ear bluetooth options out there with a really big price range and if you are here looking for a 'mid-range' option then I'd say you are getting your moneys worth and then some.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"This is the second set of Cowin headphones that I have purchased, the first for myself and these for my daughter.  An excellent product with very good sound quality and bass production.  As opposed to other headphones that I have owned, these are very comfortable to wear even for an extended period of time.  I have used them in air travel and find that they do a good job of cancelling engine noise but not quite as much as I would have hoped for.  Even at that, I have no real complaints.  Very good product....",4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"Crisp sound, strong bass, connect quickly.  Lots of padding make them comfortable even for extended use.  Noise cancellation works well, and the padding makes an effective seal around the ear.  If this was all they delivered I'd still give them a five-star review, but they are awesome for making phone calls, like so awesome I use them for almost every call.But the icing on this electronic cake is the Cowin Bluetooth Receiver/Car kit.  I plug it into my receiver, turn it on, turn my headphones on (after shutting off Bluetooth on my phone so it doesn't try to connect to that and get confused) and in a few seconds I'm getting the same amazing sound from my TV and no one else has to hear it.  And all I have to do to switch back is turn off the receiver, turn my phone bluetooth back on, and then turn on the headphones - no need to for manual pairing.  Kudos to Cowin",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"I've had these for 4-5 months now and I am quite happy with them.  I wear these at the office, blue toothed to my laptop.  Connection is smooth and reliable, the battery lasts all day [easily].  I took these on a trip to Africa last and the battery last for the entire leg form Houston to Frankfort and then from Frankfort to Lagos.  I had more battery left after 15 hours of traveling and a 2hour layover in Germany.Additionally, I do like the removable and replaceable battery feature.",4,1,2017-12-19,1,1,0
The title pretty much sums up my disappointment. They are comfortable enough and the sound quality is average. But the noise canceling is null. They work about as well as $10 earbuds. i needed a new set of blue tooth HP so i may keep but they do nothing for studying at home with minimal background noise. I can't imagine they would be any use at all at a coffee shop or out in public,2,1,2020-1-30,1,1,0
EDIT:  doesn’t connect to TV either and USB  adapter sold separately won’t connect to PC.  Should of just taken 60 bucks and used it to buy quality head phones. I will keep it at 3 stars because it connects to iPhone and has nice sound.  ...I got them for 60bucks so did not expect much.  Fast blue tooth connection.  Sound quality is Good to very good.  Mid range frequency is lacking but bass is nice and highs are OK.  Noise cancelation is useless.  I can hear my heart beating through them kid of weird and still hear lots of noise except for fans and very even white noise.  I did own Bose quiet comfort and those were excellent in every respect but also $350 +.,3,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"10 out of 10 these are SICK lol only for $60 these headphones feel like they worth more than that. You'll get a case, Charger and a cable to connect it wired. Base & Sound quality are great already happy with my purchase and felt in love with these headphones as a person who is sharing a room and don't want to hear my back round noise this noise cancelling was worth the hype that I felt when I hit the purchase button.

"Moms need time out too. My husband got me these for Christmas primarily for traveling but I paired them with my phone, walked around the house in the 'noise-cancelling' mode while listening to a Podcast. I didn't hear anyone complaining at me. It was a little slice of heaven on earth.  Great sound, comfortable fit on my head- I hate ear buds- and I could walk around my main floor without a wire attached to my phone. It was awesome.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,1,0

"First i want to make a comment about this company. This company is in the rare 1% of company's that actually care about their products and the reviews people leave. I bought these headphones less than a month ago. I left a review not talking bad about the product but what could be better and what not. This company contacted me and asked me a couple questions then advised me that they were sending me something for my time. They sent me an additional pair of the noise canceling headphones with a apology letter on the front of the box. Never in my life have i had a company do something like this, they went out of their way to make sure i was happy. Even if i wasn't somewhat happy about a couple things with the headphones they went and made sure i was happy anyways. This company is amazing and they just got a customer for life, i will always remember what they did.The head phones come packaged in a very nice sleek box, inside the box there is foam outlining the headphones. It comes with everything you need including a nice leather like carrying bag. As far as sound goes, the base isn't really there for me. This being said listening to rock/hardcore these headphones are fantastic. I listened to every type of genre except country and everything sounded great except the music with heavy/hard base. Dont let this deter you, these head phones are worth every penny. They look great and the noise canceling works really good. When you flip the noise canceling switch on you can actually hear the canceling taking place. These are solid headphones for anyone. Plus having a good product backed by an amazing company makes everything so much better. Thank you very much Cowin for everything you have done for me personally and you have earned a customer for life.",5,1,2017-8-20,1,0,0

"These headphones live up to their advertising. The quality is evident from the moment they are taken out of the box. They are very comfortable to wear for hours while listening to Audible.I am not an audiophile but the music I have listened to came through very well. Noise canceling works well also. My only minor complaint is that wearing them while jogging their weight might be a bit annoying to some users. Other than that , I heartily recommend them.",5,1,2018-11-23,1,1,0

"My Bose headphones were stolen from my office and I didn't want to pay over $300 to replace them. These came highly recommended by Amazon and several other sites, so I bought them. Compared to my old Bose noise cancelling headphones, these are inferior. External noise is not cancelled even with noise cancelling on. They are lightweight and made of what feels like inexpensive plastic, and all the buttons feel like they'll break if I push them hard. They do not fold. On the positive side, they pair easily with Bluetooth, the sound quality is good when the room is silent, I have not experienced any latency with the Bluetooth connection, and the headpieces are readily adjustable and fit fine. For $60, these are good enough. But they are not Bose quality.",3,1,2019-1-13,1,0,0

"Great packaging, nice-looking headphone, no problems with Bluetooth connection.  Unfortunately, as soon as I started listening to these headphones, I noticed that it seems to attenuate the highs.  I think this is probably not uncommon with some noise canceling devices.  I have a cheap pair of Sony earbuds that I use when walking, and I connected these to the same device by Bluetooth, and their sound is considerably better than these headphones.  Admittedly, I do wear hearing aids (which I obviously remove before listening to headphones or earbuds) but even so, the Sony earbuds have a much better sound quality in my opinion.",3,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"I got these because I wanted some decent wireless headphones for traveling and bouncing around the house listening to podcasts or music will doing chores. I also wanted them for my work which takes place in a compact area where the sound seems to travel way to easily. They are fantastic! Easy to pair with my devices. The noise cancelling is great for mowing the lawn or knocking out the chatter in the office background. The sound quality puts a smile on your face and the bass quality if you gotta have that low-end thump is excellent. I would recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable, excellent wireless solution.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,1
"The ear pads should be larger so as to cover the entire ear. The edge of the pads fit on (not over) the thin sensitive top of the ear and pinch that part of the ear.  After a few minutes of compression, wearing them becomes painful and uncomfortable.  At that point, the constant attempts to move the pads and reduce the discomfort distracts from one's concentration on the movie/program/music being listened to.  Also, there is no way that a battery charge lasts 30 hours on these earphones. I doubt that I get a maximum of 8 hours on a charge - more like about 6 hours. I have wasted money on these but now know what to look for as I research for a more comfortable product. I have no quarrel with the sound of these earphones; however, I caution all prospective buyers to be aware of the likelihood that you will find these earphones to be painfully uncomfortable. For this reason alone I cannot recommend them.",3,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"For the price they are great. The sound quality is excellent. Even without the noise cancellation I can't hear much of anything IF I have my music on. Without music it doesn't cancel out much, voices are canceled out the least. More often than not I leave the noise cancellation off because 1.the sound is more full without. 2. the noise cancellation makes my ears feel like they are pressurized, like in an airplane. The headphones are super comfortable. As a writer trying to tune out the world I have them on for hours at a time with no problem.I gave them a 4 out of 5 because they are great sound and with music do their job but without music they don't cancel out much.",4,1,2018-4-5,1,0,0
"I have had 2 Bose headphones before I purchased this Cowin model. I was very much surprised as to the sound quality of this product. It was much closer in quality to Bose than the price would suggest. It paired well with my cell phone via Bluetooth, but it did not pair at all with any of my 3 desktop computers which was a disappointment since I had hopes that it would. Internet talk indicates that this is not a rare problem, and no solution has been found, so I am planning to give up the wait and will be looking at another brand since I am not certain that Cowin has fixed the problem in their headphones.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
Great at first...they worked great while inside when we first got them. My husband does lawn care and that the reason we purchased these. He has used them all week while working. They don't sound anything like they did when we tried them out in the house. He says is sounds like waves while wearing them outside. When we talk on the phone while he works all I hear is background noise and can't hear him at all....in the process of waiting for someone to contact me back about the sound quality. The husband is not very happy over these headphones.Well almost a year later these headphones broke and customer service was super awesome with getting us a replacement.  They sent a code to us and they only  cost us 64 cents!!! The replacement pair was 5 days early. Super surprised by that also!!,5,1,2019-5-17,1,1,0

I keep disconnecting the device to check if its the program I am listening to, but the sound is clear until I listen through the headphones.

Can't wait for my next trip.  This is what I wrote originally:  ""These feel and act like quality phones, but they are so big and heavy that it's impossible for me to experience the quality unless I'm holding them to my ears.  My head is on the smaller end of 'average' . . . I'd highly recommend them for people with larger heads than mine. . .""",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0

By the time she told me they weren't great it was pass the return date, the headphone noise cancelling is adequate and the sound is good... for certain genres but when she listens to hip hop it sounds off and the beats sound suppressed. Was really hoping all the great reviews meant it was a sure thing but oh well since they were only $70 I'm not to upset but was hoping sound quality would be most important thing for wireless headphones.

"I will start by saying this is my second pair of Cowin E7 Bluetooth 4.0/Active Noise Cancelling/NFC Over Ear Headphones with Deep Bass, Microphone, Extremely Comfortable Protein Earpads with an Outstanding Battery life when using them in Active Noise Cancelling mode, or not. Every manufacturer of headphones and/or earbuds that offer any type of noise cancelling/noise reduction/Etc. feature in there headphones and/or earbuds ALL have to deal with quicker battery consumption when in that mode, noise cancelling mode, versus not turning that function on. I mostly, about 90% of the time, use my Cowin E7 Headphones for watching TV in bed so I do not disturb my wife from trying to get a good night sleep. I also have never used my Cowin E7 Headphones without the ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) feature turned on. Even with the ANC on, which we should all know now drains the battery somewhat quicker than if ANC is off no matter who the headphones and/or earbuds are manufactured by, I still am getting between 36 and 39 hours of playtime, depending upon my volume setting/the louder you turn up the volume - the more it drains the battery, before I need to charge the 750mAh battery. When it is time to charge the battery, it only takes about 4 hours tops to charge the battery fully. The E7’s are also equipped with an auxiliary in so that you may connect the E7’s directly to a device for a “hard wired” for lack of a better word, connection if you prefer that type of connection over a Bluetooth or NFC (Near Field Communication) connection. You can also listen to the E7 Headphones while plugged in with the MICRO USB charging cable to your power supply for charging. It charges at a slower rate, but if you absolutely needed to continue to use the headphones after they have run out of juice, you can. As I stated above, I primarily use my Cowin E7 Headphones for watching TV in bed. My bedroom Samsung LED TV from 2012 is an older model without all the bells and whistles that most TV’s come with today, but the LED picture is still top notch and as good as or better than most TV’s made today with several exceptions I do admit. But, it’s still an excellent picture and perfectly fine for the bedroom. One whistle my older 2012 Samsung LED TV does not have is Bluetooth capabilities.  So I purchased a TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter/Receiver with Wireless 3.5mm Audio Adapter, Low Latency, Pair 2 Devices (headphones/earbuds) at Once, Model #: TT-BA08 and connected it to the TV mentioned above and I have basically 0, or almost no visible latency issues whatsoever while watching TV using my Cowin E7 Headphones. For those who do not know what latency is, it’s when what your hearing through your headphones doesn’t match up with the person(s) mouth that the words are coming out of that your watching on TV. Really annoying! But, the Cowin E7 Headphones have no problem with latency when used in connection with a TaoTronics TT-BA08 Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter/Receiver. They are very comfortable wearing for long periods at a time, they come with a nice vinyl carrying/storing case, although I would pick-up Cowin’s Hard Case. They are excellent for taking/receiving phone calls and clear as can be on both, your end with the E7’s on and the other end where one can hear you talking hands-free & clear as can be, through your E7 Headphones Microphone. At $59.99 (at the time of this review 5/6/2020) they are an absolute steal!! And at 27,922 ratings that average out to give the Cowin E7 Headphones a 4.4 out of 5 stars (at the time of this review 5/6/2020) you can’t go wrong. How can all of us be wrong, and how can theses Cowin E7 Headphones continue to be an Amazon Best Seller for at least 3 years straight, maybe longer, that I know of?!?!

"When purchasing these headphones I did not expect them to compare with headphones priced at triple or quadruple the price, but I am quite satisfied with the quality of build. The sound quality is also quite good for the price as is the noise cancellation. I would definitely buy these again and recommend them for anyone on a budget.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"I am very impressed! Right from the packaging, the kind customer welcome note, all the way to the technology and performance.First of all, the headphones are very attractive and the controls are located conveniently.  The only surprise was the volume decrease/prev. track ""-"" is located at the top of the control button and the volume increase/next track ""+"" is located at the bottom of the control button.  While this is counter-intuitive, with time, it becomes natural.",5,1,2018-3-5,1,1,0

"I needed to upgrade my NCH which were wired. That was a bit of a hassle on planes. I tested the Cowin E7 at home when I got them and was quite impressed with the sound quality, even thru bluetooth. I gave it 5 stars for Noise Cancellation based on home testing. If this changes after I've been on trips, I will update the review.For the price it's good quality. I am usually careful with electronics so I hope it will withstand travel.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"I had a little trouble pairing with my three devices (iPhone, iPad and MacBook). I got the phone paired but nothing else seemed to work.  I found the instructions very technical and difficult to understand.  I am 77 years old and didn’t grow up with all this tech stuff.  However when I emailed the help line, I got a quick response .  Apparently there can only be one Bluetooth “on” within range of this product.  This is fine when I’m quarantined in my house with my husband.  However if I’m on a plane next to someone who has blue tooth - I’m not sure if I will be able to use this.  Product blocks sound significantly, but I can still her a TV a bit someone else is watching .  The other person was not able to hear the movie I was watching so that was good.  I have never had a product like this so wasn’t sure what to expect.",4,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
Pros: Fits great. really comfortable for long periods. I have a big head and ears so finding something that fits is a challenge.Sound is good. I am an audiophile so sound is extremely important to me. That sound really good. The speakers can be over driven so they will distort but back it off to a reasonable level and it will be fine. Bass is not bad but not bone rattling.,4,1,2019-5-10,1,0,0
"This headphone delivers quality sound without the annoying “hiss” of some devices.  Very comfortable to wear and made well, so should last a long time.  My only complaint is a very small on-off switch.  Both the tiny switch and the headphone it is contained in are dark black so finding it quickly is difficult. I can live with this slight deficiency for the other great assets of this headphone. Update.  Note: Four months after purchase, battery stopped charging. Cowin came through with fast and friendly customer service and replaced the headphones without charge.  Great product and terrific company that stands behind their product.",4,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
Bought them on a deal when my wireless ear buds were not working and glad I did. Amazed how well they paired and the distance I can walk from the computer without the bluetooth cutting out even with a wall between. No other bluetooth device have I used where I can walk around into different rooms and still have a connection. I found having a conventional battery well worth the convenience of always being charged and ready to go. Half the time I would forget to charge my wireless buds and I wouldn't have music/radio for the day.I don't need the noise cancelling feature even while using a medium production scanner all day long. My only complaint is the top of my head is bothered by the head strap resting on it all day. My husband sits tethered to his computer with his $300 Bose headphone while I am walking all around the office moving files happy as a clam. I did lose the card to get another 6 mos of warranty though :(.,4,1,2017-8-16,1,0,0
This is a very sleek and niftt product at the price. They go over your earsn to ensure a more snug fit than your regular headphones.NC is pretty good at this price point. Drowns out most ambient noise and speech from > 15 feet away. I wish the headphones were a bit more adjustable around the head and the fit around the ears werent so tight (maybe a slightly larger cup). I will bump up the review if the ear phone covers last through the hot california summer without ripping to shreds. Great VFM,4,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0

"I was looking for a good value in noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones, and the Cowin E7 fits the bill.  The sound quality is good, the noise-cancelling works, the headphones fit my big head, it was easy to connect to my phone and iPad, and the battery life is excellent.  The only issue I had was that it was somewhat challenging to get the E7s to connect to my Windows 10 laptop after they were connected to my phone.  I had to turn Bluetooth off on my phone, turn the headphones off, then turn the headphones back on to get them to connect to my PC.  Not a big deal, once I figured that out.

"I bought these headphones on a Gold Box offer for just under $40. I have been wanting some wireless headphones to use with my Amazon Echo but did not want to spend a couple of hundred dollars for something I would only use occasionally. These headphones turned out to be perfect for that purpose.The headphones arrive very nicely packaged in a black box surrounded in plastic wrap. Included with the headphones are a USB charging cable, a 1/8 inch stereo cable for wired connection to an audio source, and a soft storage bag. A brief printed user manual is also provided. No AC/USB adapter is provided, so you will either need to purchase one separately or use a computer USB port to charge the battery.",5,0,2017-7-28,1,3,0
"I was super excited to replace my old Arctic P311 headset. Although they were comfortable and lightweight and the battery life was amazing, they were more than five years old and ugly. However, this new headset is literally too painful we wear. I've been toughing it out hoping they'd a break-in, but they broke me. The pressure over my ears and weight on top of my skull is too much. I find myself readjusting hoping for a sweet-spot. I should be enjoying, audiobooks, music, and podcasts not pretending I'm comfortable. Steer clear of these. Don't let the deal sway you.",1,1,2019-8-12,1,2,1
"Bought these Headphones because I've been wanting a set of bluetooth noise cancelling for a while. So far i've been very pleased. Been using them for a month everyday. They have a really good range on them. I can move about 40 feet away from my phone before the bluetooth gets wonky. The noise cancelling is very good, although it does quiet the sound down. Bass could be better but Its what I expected from headphones of this price. Overall i really like them my only complaint would be that the ear pieces seem really flimsily attached i'm afraid they are going to fall off.",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"These headphones are very comfortable. They are soft on the ears and are still comfortable after hours of watching TV. The noise cancellation is excellent. My wife has to get right in front of me to get my attention. I can't hear her or the dogs barking. The Bluetooth connection is very stable. It never drops connection and the sound is crystal clear. I love the stereo sound. When it's right in your ears, the stereo will really surprise you. i highly recommend the Cowin headphones.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I love these headphones.  The two things I am usually most skeptical about when buying headphones is sound quality and durability of the fabric around the ears (I hate it when the material gets flaky and worn after only a few months).  These headphones definitely fulfilled my expectations in terms of staying in good condition and delivering a high-quality sound experience.My own constructive criticism I would give is that the microphone quality is not super amazing.  My friends and wife tell me that when I use the E7's microphone during phone and video calls, I sound like an astronaut talking through his spacesuit.  But, seeing as I mainly wanted the headphones for sound quality and durability, I was very satisfied with my purchase.  And as a plus, these headphones are much more affordable than others I've seen and the battery longevity is great! (I can go for a week or two without charging them)",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0

I can wear them for hours without any difficulties or discomfort.",3,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
I absolutely love these headphones but I originally wrote a negative review because they stopped working less than a year with not much use.

"Headphones are great looking. Sound could have been a little better. Volume could have been a little louder but that's just in my opinion. They fit over my ears perfectly. The sound canceling was ok but not all that great especially when you move around the sound gets distorted. For working out the noise cancelling will likely not be the best as the sound gets choppy. In regular BT mode the sound is great. The packaging was great and nicely presented. The headphones itself felt a little cheap but for the price I guess you pay for what you get. This product could have received a 4 star but since the product came defective I am in the process of returning it. The headphones didn't charge at all the first day I received them. When I plugged it in to the charger, I got the hint and smell of something burning but no visible smoke. I'm sure that has something to do with it. The charging light indicator never turned on. I don't think I will be buying them again even though they came defective, for me I didn't like the overall feel and look like as opposed to the picture. Too much plastic and feels a little cheap. Otherwise headphones are OK for the price and it's neat that they come with noise cancelling.UPDATE 3/27/17:  I was contacted by a Cowin rep after I had posted my original review. They were genuinely concerned about my defective unit and sent me a replacement at no cost for my troubles. I received it right  away and this new unit works great. They charge and hold a solid charge (unlike the defective ones). The quality is still the same nothing has changed. Updated the rating.",4,1,2017-1-29,1,0,0

"For the price range this is a good headset but it is definitely not the highest quality.  I was able to compare the noise cancelling with a friends Bose headset and I found that the Bose definitely is better but not worth the extra $200 for the Bose.  It took me a while to come to that conclusion because the of the minute difference.  The biggest disappointment with this device was the bass,  don’t buy if you require high quality bass. I felt that it underperformed considering the size the the speakers.  It is comfortable to wear and I could fit my whole ear inside the hole.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Sound was surprisingly good-and easy to connect to blue tooth.  The only down fall I could see was the ear pieces need to be more adjustable for size- my head is small so it worked out but I ordered 3 sets-returned 2-also it was great for selecting one blue tooth item but not more than one.  For example I connected my kindle to play movies on the airplane but when I got home and wanted to connect to my ipod I had issues-it only likes one master.  Other than that, I like them very well and super soft to sleep in.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"So I bought these per the recommendation of my coworker.  Just bc of the price point in comparison to Beats & Bose, I was a bit skeptical.  But these are probably one of my best purchases ever.  They work great on the plane and almost completely eliminate engine noise.  The surprising part to me was that I charged them fully, had a round trip to/from Tokyo and DFW, round trip to/from Baltimore and DFW, and another flight to Phoenix before I recharged them.  That’s with active. Pose canceling on for all.  I probably could have made it the return flight from Phoenix too.  I love them so much I bought my wife the E7 Pro.  Now I am jealous bc hers are nicer.  But my E7 are still amazing!",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0

"I like them, they are comfortable (though big) and they do what I want. They block out a lot of ambient sound (with the NC off) because they are a large physical barrier, to be honest, the NC feature seems a little pointless to me. I work in an office with a lot of people and all I find it does it reduce the base and richness of the sound of what I'm playing. But that works out because the NC feature just uses the battery faster... which lol last forever it seems. I read that the NC feature often has this little crackling noise when you move around. Mine doesn't do that at all, but I did hear it in my friend's headphones which were the newer model of these.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"These are great, over-ear headphones that are very comfortable and sound great!One of the main reasons I opted for this model is the price as well as the fact that it's a hybrid!

"This headset works really well. It is not a BOSE noise cancellation headset but, You are not spending a lot on these. They are comfortable to wear to the point that I've fallen asleep with them on. Battery life is great. It lasts a good 10 to 12 hours of play time. At least my set does. Sound is really good in comparison to some headsets around the same price. The openings are large so your ear rests inside the cavity and the foam sits comfortably against your face. Wonderful headset! Thank you",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"Update: I had written off my Cowin E7 as a poor purchase decision for a set of headphones with mediocre ANC, however that all changed last week. After reading my review, a Cowin representative reached out to offer me the upgraded model of these headphones. I was sent the Cowin SE7 to see if the Active Noise Cancellation was a better fit for my use. I've used both models while mowing grass and blowing leaves and working with engine powered tools. The Cowin SE7 definitely is the better option. The Cowin SE7 is foldable, making them more compact and the controls are easier to use as well. Comfort and fit are much improved over the E7. All around the Cowin SE7 is an upgrade to the E7 model and justifies the price increase.Thanks to Lexi with Cowin's Customer Support team for reaching out and offering the upgrade!",5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
"The best headphones for the price, and I have several others that are disappointing in comfort and sound compared to the E7. My first purchase of the E7 soon failed on the left side, but by contacting Cowin they acknowledged the problem and arranged to have me order another brand new headset from Amazon as a full replacement. Second set works great, and I am very happy with the headphones, and hopefully reliability will not be an issue with the replacement. Thanks Cowin.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0

I would not recommend these headphones for phone calls; the quality of the mic is not suited for phone use.All and all they are well worth the price, and my wife and I both have a pair we use daily to dampen machine noises around our laboratory.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
My daughter likes over-the-ear headphones.  Even though she has a $1000 digital FM system for her hearing aids.  She prefers these wireless cans.She has high powered (i.e. large) hearing aids and says these fit comfortably.  She's 10 BTW.  I think the sound quality is good for casual listening.  They're a bit boomy for my tastes (I play a lot of acoustic music... unfair to judge against the actual instrument).  But overall I can understand the favorable ratings.,4,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

Priced very well for what it offers.Dislikes: Active noise cancelling technology is pointless. You will hear no major reductions of any real noises around you. This however is not uncommon with most headsets that arent the bose qc 35II, or sony wh1000 “XM3” both bose and sony keep updating their headsets and their price is premium.

I used to hate working on my computer because he always felt the need to yell and be involved with my work. Now I put these headphones on and cannot even hear him I love them. The con is they would slip down easily because of the materials used for the head part. I solved this by putting vet wrap on the head part. Now they stay in place. Beautiful color.

"These headphones are fabulous for the workplace in this price bracket ($70). I work in a relatively noisy office with a lot of people on the phone at the same time. I have used these headphones both with active noise cancelling (ANC) turned on and off. When ANC is turned on and I have music playing the background noise is significantly dampened to the point that you will not notice it. When I use them without active noise cancelling and music, the background noise is dampened as well, but the to the same degree as when ANC is on. The build quality is a little bit cheaper feeling since they are made of plastic, so if you generally are hard on your things, do not buy these and spend a little more. Battery life has been amazing, I have not at them quit once during my work day. While I have used these after several hours I will get a small headache from wearing them, but with a short break I can put them back on and keep going.

These are such great headphones! There cups are soft on muy ears and don't cause fatigue or strain to my earlobes. The noise cancellation is an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is no noise cancellation and 10 is Bose. And these are much more affordable.

I found the cups fit comfortably over my ears.  The sound quality was good, with clear tones.  Not overbearing bass, not super awesome, but definitely there.  Noise Cancelling was noticeable and effective.  It wasn't going to turn everything silent, but it took the airplane ambient noise away, so it didn't deter from the movie on the plane.  The LED on the side doesn't appear to be super obnoxious to my neighbors.  One thing I was disappointed in was that they would not operate as un-powered headphones.  You MUST turn them on to even operate in the AUX capacity.  Speaking of AUX, I did not notice much difference between AUX vs. Bluetooth sound quality.  Also, I recorded my voice from my phone through the headphones.  It was clear, but I did sound a little far away (granted the mic is on the earcups).  Overall, I liked them very much and I hope to enjoy them for a while!",4,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"The headphones work great.  I can listen to my audio books, my Great Courses, my podcasts or my music while my wife watches her favorite TV show.  The bluetooth feature is wonderful.  The headphones pickup stereo sound clearly.  I like the pause, play and volume controls on the headphones too.  You can't beat the low price either!",5,1,2019-7-17,1,1,0

"Worked great for 4 months. Then the bluetooth stopped working.  Called tech support did what they told me still not working. Now tech support does not answer the phone.  No way to get in touch with them. Hopefully this will get their attention.I gave these a one star as they broke after 4 months. Call their tech support and 5 days later got a new pair, so I raised it to 4.",4,1,2019-9-10,1,1,0
"At 70, I finally bought myself a pair of Cowin E7 Active Noise Cancelling headset.  What can I say?  They're GREAT, especially on long road trips!  I have used them for 6 to 8 hours at a time with little or no discomfort whatsoever.  Every once in a while, I take them off just to see how well they are doing while driving and I can attest to the fact that I wouldn't be without them ever again!  Plus you can listen to music, receive phone calls, life is good!  (By the way, did I mention that the E7's are $300 or $400 less than what some competitors are selling their units for)?  My only question is; why would you want to pay more for a product you can get for so much less that's just as good, (my opinion)?",5,1,2018-4-16,1,0,0
"We purchased 3 of these for our children.  One set stopped working entirely after a few months.  The other two continue to have poor sound quality and would occasionally stop pairing with the associated devices.  We were pleased initially, but very disappointed now.  I would not recommend these.",2,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0

"I don’t know how it got all good reviews  but this is anything except noise canceling headphone. The sound is ok, but it doesn’t cancel any kind of noise, i can hear ppl speaking, lawn mower, surprised ppl  mentioning they use it on planes!Will definitely return it.",1,1,2019-7-31,1,3,0
"I've used these headphones for two years now.  The sound is excellent with full bass.  I use these while mowing my field and they drown out the sound of the mower and give very clear sound.  The plastic connection from the right earphone to the over-the-head piece just broke and don't appear to be reparable, so they don't appear to be very durable.  But I'd say they're an excellent deal for the price.",4,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"No way I'll pay $200-$300 for a pair of NC phones again. Coming off a three year run with QC15's...they're broken. Bad right speaker which appears to be a common problem. Bummer, they were great.So trying these E7s based on reviews and low price. They're super! Sound is good, NC is decent, and the Bluetooth is working flawlessly. I'm impressed! The only drawback is the cans are BIG. But they're well padded and comfortable.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"Once you use these you never want to go back. I forgot to charge them for a return flight and was so, so bummed out because of the difference they make. It blocks out most of the sharp noises of laughter, conversation and banging like being underwater. But it completely blocks the ambient noise  you don’t realize is there until it’s gone- ventilation systems, engines, air flight noise, traffic, the rumble of the modern world. This seems to be the real reason why air flight and crowded industrial settings feel like an attack on my nervous system- so dealing with all the people is easier once the HUMMMMMMM is blocked.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
Amazing headphones. I work 12 hour shifts and my headset is on almost the whole shift. Funny thing is I only have to charge it after about 3 days. Honestly holds a charge for a very long time.On top of that they are very comfortable. Sometimes I'll just walk around at work with the head phones off as it blocks most of the sounds of the machines.,5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"These are quite comfortable headphones and easy to adjust. The sound is wonderful and not distorted. However the multiple function uses for the buttons can get a bit confusing, especially with the volume control doubling at the skip track.  The material leaves me a bit worried since it is mostly plastic and artificial chrome. For the headphones to be good for travel, it'll have to be durable.  I have no doubt in these being good but i knocked a star off cause of the material. Plastic is decent but metal on the band of the headphones keeps up with durability.",4,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"I use these headphones at home so as not to disturb others while I listen to music. First off, they were VERY easy to pair with my desktop. It took no time at all. Once paired they automatically pair whenever you turn them on. They are VERY comfortable to wear, not bulky or heavy like some I have used. Good cushioning around the ears and on the head band. The sound is crisp and clear with good bass. Also, they look sharp. I mean they look sleek and stylish and feel sturdier than my last pair did. In all, I am happy with my purchase and would buy them again if something happened to this pair.",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
"If you're on a budget like myself, you will LOVE these! Sure, I could've spent more, but these feel and sound well worth 100 bucks. They even look expensive! My nephew thought they were well over a hundred dollars. The sound quality is incredible. Depending on the device you are using to stream music, you'll find that the volume varies. Based on my experience, I recommend listening to these headphones with a computer rather than a phone if you want BIG volume. My equipment may be much different from yours though.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I don’t really use the noise canceling but from what I can tell, they work well. I’ve used the headphones for music, streaming shows, phone calls, and FaceTime. Music and shows I hear just fine. Phone calls I can here very well and the person on the other side can hear, but then they can also hear other background noises (not all but some). FaceTime, I could hear, but apparently I was fuzzy sounding on the other side.Hooking it up to my phone was easy enough.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"Love these. I’m often listening to podcasts so can’t comment much on the sound quality for music but for all of my needs these have been great. I went a good month using these throughout the day at work without charging them. I finally charged them because I was sure the battery would soon die but it was still going strong. These are also quite comfortable (and I have a small head and small ears so a lot of headphones are not comfortable on me). My only complaints: hanging them around my neck is awkward and if I’m connected to one Bluetooth device, I can’t connect to another without first manually disconnecting the first (probably true of most Bluetooth devices, but I still find it an annoying extra step)",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"I bought these as a backup to my wired Bose headphones for airline travel and cannot believe how good they sound.  I figured for the price, I could take a chance and not be out too much if they sounded terrible.  I can honeslty say I have paid a lot more for something and received much less.  These are a tremendous value.  They sound better than my Bose at all volume levels (although it is close).  The volume can get very loud with these with no noticable distortion.  The active noise cancelling is awesome and not at all annoying like some others can be.  These are very easy to set up and simple to use.  While I haven't had them very long, I cannot believe how long the battery lasts between charges.  Very impressive.  I can do my weekly travel on only one charge.  Great not to have to carry batteries anymore.  Very solidly constructed and do not feel like a value priced product.  I could not be happeier with these.",5,1,2018-1-18,1,0,0
"I really liked these at first, but over time I started hearing a loud crackling noise when I turned them on. Also, during sound, there are random loud pops. Sound quality still is good except for these pops.",2,1,2020-4-17,1,2,0
"My old noise cancelling headphones broke so I bought these, I loved mine but wanted wireless ones. I had my old ones for probably 6 years and loved them, but often times would still have to turn my music volume all the way up and would still be able to hear noises. I am working from home and I am very sensitive to noise and can hear the people above me walking and TVs all day, so I needed good headphones. These ones were more comfortable for all day wear and covered noise notably better than my previous ones.  I find that every morning it takes  a few minutes to connect to my computer, a little annoying but not a big deal. For some reason they do not work with every application on my computer, so when I am in meetings, the audio comes back out of my computer speakers which has been super annoying.  Other reviews said the WiFi connection goes far, but I cannot walk a room over without loosing connection, probably no more than 10 feet.  The battery does last for a few days. My biggest issue is that I can hear a constant buzzing and was using two audio sources at once to cover the noise. After having them for a few weeks, they stopped connecting to my computer so cannot be used. They keep saying ""Bluetooth is off"", however Bluetooth is on, and no other Bluetooth devices are having issues so it is not the WIFI. I will be returning these due to that issue, as I can no longer use them.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"These headphones were pretty decent when I first got them, the noise cancelling wasn't as good as I had hoped but good enough for what I needed them for and good sound quality. However, they have always struggled  connecting to my phone or my computer, usually taking 5-10 minutes of me turning them on and off multiple times before they will connect. Now when they do connect I won't hear anything or the sound will be super choppy when they do, even though I am right next to the device they are connected to. Pretty disappointed.",1,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"These are the best headphones that I have ever purchased.  I am a senior citizen and really needed some good headphones that would be comfortable, block noise so I can enjoy audio books. and connect easily with bluetooth.The COWIN E7 Earphones are successful with each of these features.  The fullness of bass and tone are incredible!  When I am not listening to a book or music, I occasionally wear them because the TV is too loud.  I readily recommend these headphones!",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
I really like these Bluetooth headphones. Enough that I own 3 because my kids and my husband kept stealing them from me. The battery is the best part as it last a long time! The only thing I don't love is that I feel it doesn't get loud enough. If you are one to listen to music blasting in your ears these are not for you. I guess they are safer that way.. over all I really like them and recommend. They are also very comfortable and so far my eldest pair is holding up good so they seem durable.,5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I read the mixed reviews on these headphones and decided to give them a try and judge for myself.  I purchased them solely for listening to my Bluetooth capable Samsung TV.  I was able to pair them to the TV, but from a distance of 10 to 15 feet the connection kept breaking up, and if I turned my head to the side the audio would break up.  I tried them for 2 nights with a few hours of use, and the Bluetooth connection just was not reliable.  The problem is with the headphones and not the TV because I tried my motorcycle Bluetooth headset and it’s connection to the TV was perfect.  The Bluetooth connection with these headphones might be okay if you are pairing with something right next to you, like a phone, but they do not work with a TV on the other side of the room.  I returned them to Amazon.",1,1,2019-7-27,1,1,0
"While it works, it works exactly as advertised.  Pretty good sound cancelling, fits well. The problem is that it's not exactly great construction, and the cords for power charging and for using it while plugged into the computer (as opposed to bluetooth) broke right after the support period was over.  They definitely know exactly how long these cords last...You also can't listen and charge the headphones at the same time; if you try, there's an incredibly loud static sound that plays.I also sometimes would pick up some kind of signals from neighboring apartments even with bluetooth mode off.  That was...interesting.",2,1,2019-7-17,1,1,0
"I bought these for my son as a Christmas gift.  He really likes them for listening to music, shows and YouTube on his phone.  The noise cancellation is good, but he can still hear things around him.  The sound quality is pretty good for the price, but not as good as other cans.  But while they do sound pretty good, they do also lack in the bass department.  If you have an EQ setting on your phone, you will definitely want to use that to help boost up the bass levels.",4,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I used these headphones for six months. Almost to the day the swivel joint for one of the ears broke, just like other reviewers have said. The issue is a design flaw.Tried to warranty, but can’t because I don’t have the serial number.",1,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones hoping to use it during my commute and at home while I spend time playing some PC game with friends.PROS: sound quality is great. I believe it is very comparable with the more expensive and popular brands out there. When I connect the device to my phone, the music sounds superb.",5,1,2017-7-13,1,3,0
"This is actually the second pair I have owned. This first pair was stolen from me. They have great sound are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. My only complaint is they slip off very easily because I lie with my head propped up on a pillow when I use them, but it isn't worth knocking them down a star. At least this time I got them in the color I really wanted. The first time I ordered a pair all that was available was black. I didn't really mind but this time I got the blue and they look great. Got a matching blue hard case so they look good and are protected.",5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
The noise cancellation is not quite as good as expected but overall this is an excellent product for the price. Easy to link bluetooth connection. Once connected it is stable and persistent within 30 feet or so of the source. Would recommend and would buy again. We'll see how it holds up. The warranty is 18 months so hopefully no problems down the road.The noise cancellation is better than I first thought. Some frequencies better than others. The sound quality is adequate and you won't be disappointed considering the price.,5,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones for when I mow my yard. My original thought was for more comfortable ear protection then what I was using but I figured that some music would be nice too. I tried my earbuds first but they didn't block out the background noise.  These things are GREAT! My music comes through clearly and almost no background noise.  I can still hear my mower but just enough to know it's still running.  The music quality is very good and volume is good.  I listen to my Amazon Music playlists trough my cell phone and its works with no issues.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the because of the hand controls on the headphones themselves (Play, Pause, Skip ect...).  I can't get them to work as they should. I don't know if it's me, the device or a bit of both but they don't do what they say they will do in the instructions. That being said, they work perfectly when controlled from my phone Via Bluetooth.",4,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0

"I should've brought them as my first pair off of amazon right away then other pairs that didn't work from amazon by different company. Anyways, Their comfy headphones; Bluetooth doesn't have any problems connecting to devices. Sound and Bass quality is wonderful. Noise canceling is on top! Can’t hear anyone with these on, peace and quite! Lol. Battery life last long time. Only problem I had was the audio cord that didn't work for my devices. I had other headphones with audio cord and my high jack worked fine just didn't work out for me apparently with their audio cord.I asked nicely to customer service if they had cord to give to me as a replacement one but of course they ran out of them. They put some money back into my account to buy new cord off of amazon at least they were kind enough to do that. Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone that wants to get new pairs.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I am migraine-prone and I live in a noisy neighborhood with several very loud neighbors to deal with. I was looking for a pair of noise cancelling headphones that fit comfortably over the ear and wouldn’t break the bank. I’m very happy with these! The noise cancelling is phenomenal and I like that they are wireless/rechargeable. I can tune out music, loud animals, construction, and the helicopter that flies around my neighborhood every night. I don’t use these much for listening to music, but the sound quality is still very good.Definitely would recommend!",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"These are very good quality headphones at this price point. The sound is great with nice bass. These are not so loud that you will blow out an ear drum but they are loud enough to enjoy. The noise cancelling from the ear cushions is great but the digital noise canceling could be a little better. I am pretty sure the newer model is much better. Also, they were shockingly light. They are made out of plastic but feel like they are well constructed. The plastic really helps to keep them light and comfortable. Overall this is a great affordable everyday set for people who can't or don't want to spend over $200 on a set. I will definitely be purchasing other Cowin products. As a final note, the customer service is amazing.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones almost 3 years ago and have used them almost every workday since (probably averaging about 3-4 hours of the day) and they've only now started to show their age.  One of the phones has come loose from the headstrap and doesn't hold as well against my head anymore.  As far as I'm concerned I have definitely gotten my money's worth from these headphones and if it weren't for the fact that a different pair that I use has lasted just as long under maybe slightly harsher use, I might be replacing them with an identical pair.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I purchased Cowin headphones in April/16 and did not use upto May/20. After 3 months of using ,3 times a week 3 hours each time, the black cover of the ear pillows and Diadem started to fall apart doing dirty in my ears and around. Can't understand how the manufacturer can combine so good sound (yes! Good sound) with so low quality materials of the visible parts. Obviously I am not asking for some kind of warranty. I only wanted inform about my particular problem.",1,1,2020-9-8,1,1,1
"My husband loved his so much that when I needed to replace an older (different) brand I decided to buy one exactly like his instead.  Instantly paired with my Bluetooth connection on my PCs at home and at work - work responsibilities often have me needing to attend webinars under headphones so I don't disturb my co-workers - carry this between my work desk PC and home and use it for work and play.  It's great - a wonderful value when compared to more expensive units, and perfect for voice as well as music.  We couldn't be more pleased!!",5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"These cancel out outside noises quite well!  My mom is working from home in the same office room as I am and we both wear them. We can’t hear each other talking and I can’t hear most other noises in the house aside from some very loud noises like the dog barking, etc.  the sound quality is pretty good as well, I do feel like I have to turn it up a little louder than other headphones to hear though.

"These headfones are awesome. I've never had a set of noise canceling headfones, to compare these to, but while sitting near a noisy refrigerator, I turned these on and off and the noise was at least cut by half. The build quality is extremely good and gives the impression that they will last. Battery life is also good. I charged them when they arrived a few weeks ago and they have been working since.  Lastly, I gave these to an audiofile friend to try and he was impressed.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
Just my first impressions.  I just received my copy yesterday.  I have been using them for several hours now.PRO:  It is a really a nice looking set.  Nicely finished.  Fits comfortably over my ears though I probably have a smaller head.  Sounds isn't audiophile quality but still pretty good.  Good frequency response across the audio spectrum.  Plenty loud enough.  Noise cancelling works.  Cancels most low frequency noises.  Well packaged and a carrying bag is included.  Price!,5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"When you switch to Noise canceling, there is a difference, but it is considerably more than one would expect.Granted you get what you pay for.

They were not very durable hence buying this pair.",2,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0
These sound great and they're wonderful at noise cancellation.  I wear them while mowing the yard and can't even hear the mower running.  The only thing I'm a little worried about is the material used in the padding.  It seems pretty delicate.  It's still holding up well but I don't use them much.Battery life is amazing.

"Even 10$ would be way too much for them, big, flimsy, cheaply made, heavy, felt like they were made out of the radioactive materials, otherwise  I would recommend them for little boys and girls, since they do look like a toy, 3 pound toy lol! noise cancellation? hahaha!!!! The sound was not too bad though, when I seen them I thought it was going to be much worse!",2,1,2019-5-16,1,2,0

"I LOVE these headphones! I share this product with everyone I know looking for a solid pair of noise-cancelling over-ear headphones. These are my constant companion whenever I fly overseas to visit my family abroad. For such an affordable pair of headphones, I am in awe of how great the noise canceling is and how great the sound quality is. Will definitely be seeking a new pair when these eventually bite the dust, but they hold a charge for weeks and I have yet to have them run out of battery on active noise canceling playback while on 10+ hour flights. Very impressed!",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Actually a great headphone set for the price.  They connect readily to my phone, PC, laptop, or tablet (Android, Windows, Amazon Fire, Apple) with no issues.  Although I do Have to unpair them from one, before pairing to the next.  The sound quality is great for conference calls, watching videos, listening to most music (my music tastes aren't into heavy bass, so I can't say if they're good there).  The noise cancellation is awesome.  I've had headphones that made my head feel like it was in a vice, and these are definitely better.  They're comfortable, even after several hours on.  The battery life is impressive too.",4,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"I was surprised by the quality of these headphones given the price. The noise cancelling works pretty well. I use them in the office when my cubicle mate has her fan on full blast. It cuts the noise dow to a dull hum, but I could still hear coworkers talk.. The bluetooth connecting is good. Easy to connect. The sound is decent. It has a well rounded bass sound. I had trouble connecting it to my Mac Mini, but it connects to my MacBook Air & my Google Pixel just fine. It lasts quite a while on a charge. They are pretty comfortable, but can get hot & sweaty when wearing them for long periods of time. Worth the price for the noise cancelling feature alone.",4,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"Honestly, I was not expecting what I received. I wanted a ""decent"" pair of over the ear headphones to exercise in. I already have a pair of high end over the ear, noise cancelling headphones that I use for work. Let me yell you, these are as good, if not better than what I have !! I am still shocked ! Opening the awesome packaging and seeing the design blew me away. The sound, the noise cancelling, and bass are amazing ! I will be buying another set for a gift. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Decent headphones for the price. Like other reviews state, the microphone on these suck. I have attempted to have a conversation while headphones were connected to my laptop and cell, both attempts where a fail. The person on the other end could not hear me. As far as the ANC, THEY ARE AMAZING. Wish they could be a bit lighter, though. They can tend to slip a little on your head when if you are tilted too far over your desk, like I am when writing. The quality of the sound is good and so is the distance. I would totally suggest this as a minimal option, but if you can afford to spend $100 more, purchase a notable brand for better overall quality. I will be looking at purchasing something different that will allow me to also carry on a voice conversation and pass these on to my hubs who likes to watch vedios on his comp or even to pair with the TV as to not disturb others around him.",4,1,2018-2-11,1,0,0

I am a very selective consumer (especially from Amazon products) who gives high value in such a product as this with its multiple 5-star reviews and overall excellent reputation.I love love love the packaging with its sleek simple style. The assortment of cards, a protective sleeve, and even a Thank You note from Corson himself — all have led me to become more than willing to give this a 5-star review. I could not be happier with the sound quality — perfect deep base, outstanding treble and balance — capped off by the fact that the noise canceling quality is so good that I can’t even hear myself speak when my music is playing. That’s a first!",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"I like everything about these headphones, comfortable to wear, good sound, good sound quality, and the company lives up to great customer service.  This is my second pair.  The first pair was great and lasted about one and one half years.  They could still work if you plugged it into your speakers, but of course this cancelled out being able to walk around your house and listen to music, you were tied once again to the speakers.  The only flaw is where you plug in to charge, over time something wore down inside that connection and it could no longer take a charge.  However, this company honored their 18 month warranty and sent me new headphones at no charge.!  Exceptional customer service!  You don't see that everyday.",4,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"We were looking for NC headphones for an upcoming trip and my wife found these Cowins. While they were being shipped a comparable set of Sony's came on sale so I purchased them, I was a little skeptical of the Cowin's and leaned towards the 'name brand'. Much to my surprise the Cowin's were a much superior product. The noise-canceling feature is much more efficient than the competitor and they sound great! Even with the Sony's on sale these were a third of the price!",4,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
"These headphones are the worse sounding headphones I've ever used. If you manage to get them to pair with anything there is a constant crackle that doesn't go away for anything. They also interfere with other Bluetooth devices, my mouse froze up everytime I tturned these things on ( I'm using them with a surface studio pro my phone can't even find the stupid things) the noise cancelling is a joke it just makes a high pitch whine when on, its just the ear cups that muffle outside noise. The only positive is that they're very comfortable so if you want something to keep your ears warm and you like irritating higpitch tones with intermixed screeches then go for it but if you want to actually listen to something look for a different set of headphones.",1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
These really do everything I wanted.  I can’t compare to say Bose noise canceling but as far as anything I have owned these are the best.

"After buying another brand and it failed, I bought this unit to listen to audio books.  I have not used the noise cancelling nor music function, so will not comment on that.  But the Bluetooth connection of this unit is outstanding with much less interference from household appliances.  Controls are easy to learn and handy.  Pairing is simple.  Comfort is outstanding for short periods with mild ear discomfort after wearing for several hours.Recommended.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"I love the feel of my wired gaming headset, but wanted something without such an obvious microphone and with Bluetooth so it would work with my iPhone 7. While the sound quality and construction of these headphones are great for the price, unfortunately I have somewhat large ears, so the earpieces don’t fit completely around my ear. Because of that, I’m not able to wear them for very long without them becoming very uncomfortable. My daughter, on the other hand, has smaller ears and loves them, so it’s not a complete loss, just not what I was looking for.",4,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
I bought these on prime day after having a lot of in-person recommendations (the entire office seems to have a pair of these!). They have been wonderful so far. The noise cancelling works well enough inside of an office space but I often use them without it. The battery life is amazing. I used these during my roundtrip flight from LA to Paris and didn't have to charge them in between!I had an issue with my first pair not charging and support was very quick to respond and make it right. I've recommended these to a lot of friends,5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"I really hoped these would work for me but they didn't. Sounded great, cancelled noise well for me. Problem is they are terrible to use for a phone headset in noisy area. They seem to amplify noise to whoever you talk to. Nobody could hear me on their end. If you are in a quiet area they are great, but then why do you need noise cancelling. Amazon sent another in case I got a lemon, it was exactly the same. I returned both and  got some made by Beltune that worked better for me.",2,1,2019-8-9,1,1,0
"Updating again - Customer service was great and they worked with me to make things right.  They stand behind their product.Updating rating again - I like the headphones and sound quality, but the swivel holding on the right earpiece broke and now they are unusable.",5,1,2018-1-22,1,2,0
"I got these headphones because they were reasonably priced and the other headphones I had were a bit too small for my ears, or rather, the padding was to thin that my ear would press against the speaker fabric meaning I could only wear it for a little bit until it started hurting.The main thing I like about these is that they are comfortable and they sound good.  I have not really used them for gaming/phone calls or anything so I can't comment on that, but the sound quality is very good.  The only real complaints I have are that the shiny metallic-colored plastic attracts fingerprints, which doesn't really bug me that much, and the volume up/down buttons (which also double for the next song\previous song buttons) seem to be upside down (the plus/next song button is on the bottom and the volume down is on the top), this bugs me slightly more, but not so much that I consider it a flaw really.",4,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"This is the second pair of these headphones we have purchased. The first pair (for my wife) was very comfortable and exceeded all expectations. After several months of use, it was time to purchase a second pair (this set for me). The pair arrived very quickly, but there was an obvious defect, rendering the noise cancellation ineffective altogether. I immediately reported the problems to the company and they worked quickly to replace the defective pair with a set that work flawlessly. I am very pleased with the end product and with the company's customer service.",5,1,2019-5-1,1,0,0
"I originally purchased the headphones as a gift for my wife, however the first set of E7's, the volume of the headset was really on the low side with max. volume. Similarly the Bass is not very distinctive, and the noise cancelling  feature is not even noticeable.  For the price I thought they were decent choice, but was not overly impressed with their performance. I was contacted by Cowin's customer service and a wrote up the headset with an average review. An email later, Cowin offered to replace the headset at no cost, since they indicated the pair I received may have been damaged. Given the free offer, I signed up for the replacement.  The replacement item was delivered extremely quickly and the performance of the replacement headset is hands down superior to the first set. The volume is fully adjustable and stereo separation and Bass performance is impressive to say the least & the noise cancelling ability makes this headset standout. I would highly recommend these for the price - they are an excellent value.  Granted it took a replacement set to obtain a fully functional set, but is was well worth the effort. I can say that Cowin went out of their way to insure their product lived up to their specifications and their Customer Service group is top notch and very courteous. Now that my wife is happy I may have to order a pair for myself!",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"The good news is the sound on these is really amazing. The bad news is that songs skip once or twice per song, even when I'm sitting RIGHT NEXT TO the Bluetooth source.  But the real reason I had to return these was that the microphone was full of static and dropped in and out and that was going to be the main reason I was going to use these. I had read this in other reviews but was hoping for the best, but alas did not get it. If you are getting these ONLY to listen to music, and don't mind occasional skipped lyrics, for the price these would be worth it.",3,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I was in love with this product at first, though adjusting the volume was a bit difficult with the buttons being so small. However, within 2 months of getting these headphones, they stopped working properly. Words go missing, it cuts in and out.Edit: Contacted the company and they replaced the original headphones for free within 24 hours of my contacting them. This second set works wonderfully and there was no hassle with getting them replaced at all. No long forms to fill out. Just a statement about what was not working. I had my new set within 48 hours of my contacting them. I would recommend this product because of the 18 month warranty. I wasn't even aware of it, until after I had placed the original review and was looking at my options. I can handle a product having an issue, when the warranty is so quick and easy to use.",4,1,2019-8-9,1,1,0
"These headphones cancel noise decently, and are much better at cancelling the low frequencies rather than the high ones. Battery life is fantastic, the 30 hours advertised is accurate. Sound wise, they have too much bass for my liking. Often the higher tones are inaudible due to the heavy bass amplification. The microphone is decent - middle of the road - neither especially good nor bad. On phone calls, the most often complaint is that my voice is too faint.",5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
"For the first month, I thought these were a really fantastic buy. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the bluetooth connection seems to get weaker and weaker with each time I use them. Listening to music on my phone, tablet, or when I pair it with my Nvidia shield just to be in my own head space has become a chore and it gets increasingly frustrating due to hearing those tell tale double beeps letting me know it's yet again having issues holding a connection. When it comes to my electronics, I am extremely careful and have been handling these like a new born baby, so no, I'm not slamming them around. I'm really dissapointed. What initially seemed like an awesome deal has quickly soured. After I submit thid review, I will be seeking a replacement.",2,1,2018-1-3,1,3,0
"Update: the seller contacted me and absolutely stands behind their product. I haven't had such a great customer service experience in a long time. The new headphones work great and I have had no problems.I am very disappointed with these headphones. They were great at first and then by the third week the problems started. There is a loud static when using the noise cancellation option and while using the auxillary cord. Unfortunately, I threw away the box or I would have returned them. Started so good but ended so bad.",4,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"I recently went back to school at a coding bootcamp which requires about 12 hours of coding a day. I wanted to invest in a good pair of headphones since I am taking all of my classes from home due to the current pandemic situation and have to share my work space with other family members. At first I was looking for the cheapest pair available but then decided it would be better to invest in a high quality pair. I am so glad I did because these headphones are fantastic! They are super comfortable, the sound quality is superb and they cancel out all outside noise completely! I will be purchasing these headphones again when it comes time for a new pair.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"They’re better options then this to be honest. I mean for a quick fix it’s awesome. It connects good, and the sound is alright, but the noise cancellation doesn’t really work, and you should be able to tune the volume up way higher.UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE!!",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones as someone who deals with sensory overload with noise and lives in a loud house. I wear them in the mornings when I'm trying to sleep before work, and the rest of the house is in the room above mine wrestling crocodiles or something. I don't use the noise cancelation feature hardly at all. When I turn it on, I can still hear whats going on around me, but it sounds like the white noise from the headphones itself is shut off. I've never actually had noise canceling headphones before, so I'm guessing that's just how they're supposed to work. However, I listen to brown noise in the mornings (it's just my favorite soothing sound) and turning that up drowns out almost all the sounds and vibrations (from stomping, pounding, bass, etc.). I can actually rest easily now! The charge holds for a long time, and the headphones themselves do not hurt to sleep in. I tried little ear buds to sleep in, and they bruised my ears, this is a much more comfortable option. Overall, I really enjoy them, and they help with what I needed them for.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I purchased four of these for my sons so they could do remote learning, after I went through two sets of other earphones which were cheap but unfortunately not high quality, with earphones that fell off, or sound that didn't work, or wires which stripped after only a little bit of use.  Cowin blows everything out of the water.  They are stylish, and so my boys are very happy to use them.  They are durable and withstand the hardest use that my sons can put them through.  Fantastic customer service, easy high-tech warranty registration process, and the best of all:  Fantastic sound and noise cancelling.  LOVE THEM!  Don't waste time buying, returning, buying, returning like I did -- Buy Cowin.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"These are truly amazing. The sound quality is more than perfect and the battery life is even better. I use these for music production and gaming on PS4 and Xbox and on both consoles they sound amazing. Music production and just listening to music they’re amazing too. If you need headphones for gaming pick these because I hear everything through these. Perfect for those high stress games where you can hear another players footsteps. I always hear them before they hear me. Battery life is amazing, if I forget and leave these on over the night, I wake up and they still manage to be on. The only thing I don’t like is how the top is so flimsy and it feels like a weak piece of metal on top. Other than that these are my favorite.",5,1,2018-12-21,1,1,0
"I was gifted a purple pair of these headphones by my mother. Before I was given these headphones, every pair I had ever used had poor sound quality, no noise cancellation, was not wireless, and would fall apart easily and frequently. These headphones are the BEST quality at such an amazing price! I unfortunately lost the purple pair, so I knew I had to replace them with the exact same brand, because I was just so blown away by the quality. Since the initial purple pair that I was gifted, I have purchased the same black headphones twice, one pair for me, and one  pair for my mom. I spend almost all of my time on my phone watching YouTube, listening to music, or watching Netflix. So having a comfortable pair of blutooth noise cancelling headphones is a dream for me. I can easily fall asleep with them on, and I do most nights. I am now a loyal customer of Cowin, not only because their products SLAP, but because the company seems to genuinely care about their customers, and just people in general. When I received my headphones, included in the box there was a card that stated if you took a picture/ video using your headphones, Cowin would donate to UNICEF. They also included cards with QR codes that take you to register your product for warranty. I am a huge fan of this product and I can not recommend it enough!",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I used my Cowin noise cancelled  headphones for the first time when we traveled to Europe for vacation. They are lightweight and very comfortable on my ears. I like the way they pack in their own bag for travel. The noise canceling was definitely an advantage while flying. Movies and music were better than earbuds I used the headphones with the cord attached but it does have Bluetooth capability. I think that, for the price, these headphones were a good buy.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"I am not an audiofile and I don't know anything about headphones. But. These easily connect to Bluetooth.  The battery life is great and has frequently lasted me  about 10 hours per each half hour charge. The noise canceling is pretty darn effective, and it's actually nice they have an option to toggle the noise canceling on and off - since I often wear them in the office when I need to focus, but still need to be able to hear my colleagues when they call me, etc.  I'm  sure it's not great for the headphones, but I sometimes even turn the volume up a bit (but not all the way) and hang them around my neck to listen out loud.",5,1,2017-4-4,1,1,0
"These are good headphones in many ways. The look and feel of the pads are good. However, there are two things that made us send these back. First, they are too small for larger heads. My husbands head is big and even at maximum length the fit was uncomfortable both in terms of height and width. I considered keeping them for myself, but the thing that bothered me most was the placement of the controls on the headset--very awkward for controlling volume. Had to send them back.",3,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"Picked these up since I saw so many positive reviews here on Amazon.  I did some online search and found a couple of reviews on YouTube as well, which also helped me with my decision.  The headphones' material is of pretty good quality for the price.  They're extremely comfortable around the ear and I have worn them for hours with absolutely no discomfort.  Keep in mind that these headphones get LOUD.  The sound only distorts ever so slightly at max volume, but the bass is just terrific.  The quality of the sound is actually very enjoyable.  I'm not an expert by any means, but compared to other headphones I've used, these sound terrific.  The noise-cancelling feature is great!  Primarily got these for use in airplanes, but I haven't had the chance to try this out yet.  I did test it at home and when the noise-cancelling feature is turned on, I hear absolutely nothing else but the music.  They work as promised.  If you need some decent headphones with good sound and noise cancelling, I would really recommend these.  No issues so far and very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"I was well pleased with the quality of these headphones.  I realize that cost does not always equate with quality andthis is the case with the Cowin E7 headphones !!  These are just excellent headphones. And the price is amazing! I think these headphones are well constructed, durable and the sound quality is most excellent. I often fall asleep wearing them and they take a beating. LOL !! But you would never know it.  You won't be sorry if you buy them and you should buy them. Trust me, your experience will be good. :)",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I had been using inexpensive (meaning cheap) headphones with my laptop, and didn't realize how much I was missing until I tried these.  Not only is the sound incredibly clean, the noise-cancelling feature allows me to escape all the background clutter that seems to appear whenever I want to settle down and listen to good music.  These were well worth the money, extremely comfortable to wear for a couple of hours and the charge lasts for days.  You don't need to be an audiophile to appreciate the quality.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I bought these to use for Zoom calls while working from home.  For me, I found them a little heavy and the microphone didn't seem to have great quality. The earmuffs were blocking out too much noise and my own voice sounded muffled to me.  I gave them to my husband and he loves them.  They fit him better and he says the sound quality for music is wonderful.  He wears hearing aids in his ears so can't use the in the ear headphones. These don't seem to give him any feedback from his hearing aids.  I listened to a song and the stereo and bass was very clear and great sound quality.  Only had these a week.",4,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I was pretty surprised at the quality of these headphones considering the affordable price.  I first heard about Cowin brand through an article about affordable technology. I use the headphones mostly for gaming, and the sound quality is great.

"In searching for a pair of over-ear headphones with sound isolation and active noise-canceling, I was ready to drop $100 on a mid-tier brand and model. Then I came across this pair of E7s from Cowin. I did my due diligence and read the reviews, compared to other brands and models, and came to the conclusion that these would be the best to try out first. The arrived shortly after purchasing and once tried them on I was sold. The fit is ideal for my head and ears. The cushion offers a snug fit and exceptional isolation. Moving to sound quality, I was shocked by the quality coming from a less expensive pair of headphones. I'm not an audiophile but I have come to appreciate a well-rounded sound with clarity and punch. These Cowin E7s bring the heat. They're not Beats. They don't have the real ability to give you ear-drum battering bass but that shouldn't be your only consideration. For regular music and TV consumer these are more than adequate.The construction and materials used in these headphones are just about the only things that I can say definitely mark these as $40 to$50 headphones. However, even for that price they will remain sturdy and provide the necessary sound you want.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0

Pretty amazed with the battery life because I've left them on overnight and still managed to have enough battery the next day to get me until I was able to charge again.I have had a small issue with stuttering/choppy sound, but I suspected it was interference from something else. Not sure what I changed, but the issue only lasted a couple hours. Both pairs have been issue free every minute outside of that.",5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
"I use the Cowin E7 ANC Bluetooth headphones for watching TV late at night without disturbing my family. After a month, my experience with them has been very good. The sound quality is quite good, with decent balance of bass, midtones, and high frequencies. Because I live in a large city, the noise-cancelling feature has helped block out the ""city drone"" of traffic and trains, etc. It also blocks the persistent hum of the refrigerator's compressor.I have not yet put the headphones to their true test, however. In a week or so, I will see how they do at cancelling the hum and drone of a large air conditioner in the living room.

Previously, I bought the newer version for twice as much,  and while I was happy with the purchase, when I broke them accidentally, I couldn't justify the money for another pair. I decided to get this older version, and honestly, I think they are better than the new one. They are more comfortable, the sound seems better, and they are easier to connect through blue tooth. The newer version are a little sleeker, but these look fine.

Talking with a multitude of friends and family, I often was told that I should just take off the headsets or use the phone mic since it was so difficult for them to hear me.",5,1,2018-12-10,1,0,1

Once connected they have great range and no noticable delay.While they are large enough for my head, they are barely big enough for my head and I don't usually have issues with head size when it comes to products. I would avoid these if buying them for someone with big hair or a larger head.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"I bought these based on the positive reviews but 1. In what I think is a weird design decision, you can not listen to these headphones with the RCA wire if the batteries are dead. I'm pretty sure headphone wires don't require power or take power from the device they're connected to, so this was weird and rendered them useless often 2. the noise cancelling is somewhere between weak to barely noticeable. Sound is good overall. But the MPOW headphones at nearly half the price are likely a better deal, even if they don't sound quite as good and are made from flimsier material.",3,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I've had these headphones for only a short time and while I used them, the quality of sound was fine. However, the head strap is connected with the ear cups by only a piece of plastic about 3/8"" in diameter and it is brittle. I laid my headphones on the table and when I picked them up the plastic piece broke. I taped everything back together and used them for awhile but then the other one broke.

"In general this is a very good value pair of headphones. However, I didn't see any other reviews pointing out how weak the noise cancelling feature is. I bought these headphones primarily because they were cheap and I needed noise cancelling to concentrate. However, when I switch to 'NC' mode in somewhere like a coffee shop, much of the ambient noise still bleeds through. Don't expect anything special with this feature.While technically these are 'noise cancelling' headphones, I would describe them more as 'noise muffling'. Don't expect Bose quality noise cancelling. They are cheap headphones after all.",5,1,2019-6-13,1,1,0
"The packaging and presentation are very good, includes a decent bag to carry it and the cables. Materials feel a bit loose and lightweight, which is what I would expect for $60.

You have to unpair it first. Didn't know that. Obviously this is not a Cowin issue, but one that I wish they had included in their documentation. Some of the low ratings seem to be related to that.Sound quality is good, although apparently my voice sounds thin/tinny to listeners.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0

Unless you have an unlimited budget, these are the headphones to beat!",5,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
"Just got these & I have to say they definitely look nice, though the plastic feels really cheap. Very nice packaging to ensure no damages during transit. That said, audio quality is fairly meh for a $60 headset. The highs are a bit tinny & the base is serviceable. Mids are actually what this thing handles well (audiobooks would be just fine). Tested them on both my PC & cell, range is definitely great on them. For the price, I feel like battery life is the only saving grace as the initial charge lasted me all morning and my 45 minutes walk to work. So about 4 hours of continual use with the noise cancellation engaged. I would say that the jump to something else a little like the Arctis 3 from Steelseries is worth the extra money.",3,1,2019-1-16,1,0,0

Because of the high ratings and my overall satisfaction with sound quality and comfort, I tried my luck and bought another pair. I had them less than six months (and I bought a case so they wouldn't break) but they developed a crackle that made them impossible to use.

I did not want to destroy my Bose unit which is not designed or priced for this use. These headphones have worked perfectly and with a light cleaning after use, remain in like new condition. My only negative comment would be the size could be a little bigger to cover people with large ears. Also with any over the ear headphone, they are not ideal for hot days in the sun. Battery and sound quality are excellent. Like any NC headphone, you can still hear the equipment but I have to look to make sure the blades are still running on the tractor since it is so quiet.They have also been knocked off my head by a branch a few times with no damage. I have also taken calls on them and the mic quality is pretty good as well.",4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0

I've only ever owned earbuds, so I can't compare them to expensive headphones. I didn't really read the materials it was made out of and solely went off the reviews. It's made out of plastic with metal size adjustments. Great sound quality for the price, noise cancelling is only a few decibels off from my brother's headphones. They also have just the right range radius for a small apartment. Very lightweight and I can't wait to try them at the gym bc my airpods broke without explanation.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0
"I gave it one extra star because the bluetooth setup is really really easy and painless, its okay for the price but I wouldnt recommend it to  anyone. The material makes you sweaty around it after about 10 minutes of wearing, it couldnt even block out the noise of a quite air conditioner which wouldnt be terrible if the sound quality was really good but its really not great. Compared to just 20$ earbuds its muffled. I'd suggest to keep moving and I'm returning mine ASAP.",2,1,2018-8-17,1,2,0
I bought these 6 months ago for my son to use with his ipad for school distance learning because the kids focus better when they are not distracted by the sounds off of their siblings devices. It works great. They are comfortable and have really good sound quality. I often use them with my phone or mp3. They have held up well and are good quality for the price.,5,1,2020-9-22,1,1,1
"I can't comment on the sound quality or noise cancelling, though I will say I definitely noticed a difference with noise cancelling on so it's doing something.My office environment can be highly distracting, it's an open office so there is little blocking noise from the next cubical or any conversations going on.  These have been fantastic and I can focus on my work without being distracted by other conversations.",5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"I am so impressed with the quality of these, and then for them to be so affordable it's all the better.  They feel very well made, they are very comfortable to wear and adjust in many ways, the noise canceling function is even better than the Sony versions I tried and the sound quality is terrific.  I've had them about a week now using them frequently and have not yet had to charge them, so the battery life is impressing me as well.  Set up was so easy I didn't even realize I'd done it.  Highly recommend these!",5,1,2019-1-11,1,0,0
"I own an older pair of the Cowin E7 headphones and love them.  They work and sound great but I recently purchased a pair for my daughter and found that they will not play audio through the 3.5 mm cable if they are not charged.  Sounds like no big deal, right?  Well, if your battery runs out on a trip and you just want to plug in to listen to music, you can't do it.  My older E7s work fine with the power off or a dead battery so I don't understand why they would make this change to the headset.  I'll be returning these and looking for another alternative but am disappointed since I enjoy my older E7 headphones.",2,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
I've been really happy with these headphones. I had to contact customer service at one point and they replied promptly and even extended my warranty. The sound quality is excellent and the bass is deep. I've never had noise cancellation before and now I can't live without it. I have a space heater by my computer because my wife keeps the house as cold as a meat locker. When I turn on the noise cancellation it almost completely eliminates that sound. I have two kids and two dogs that are also effectively noise cancelled ;) They are also very comfortable to wear.Only minor issue I have is that if I try to use the headphones at the same time as I am charging them there is a buzzing sound. I just make sure I turn them off when I'm not using them and pop them on the charger every so often.,5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"One of the best purchases I’ve ever made. I was a bit skeptical because the price was so low. I didn’t think these could be that great because headphones usually cost a fortune, but these are AMAZING! I love them. They are super comfortable. I wore them on a 15 hour flight and only took them off twice. They for over my ear which was necessary for me. Also the battery life is awesome. I traveled with them for 25 hours on international flights and the battery lasted great. Highly recommend",5,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0
"So I was a bit hesitant when I first got this product. You could v slightly hear noise if you were v close to the headphones and the volume was high. But after a week with the product, I realized this would never be an issue as you don't need the volume that high or people that close to you pretty much ever. So I was v pleased with the headphones. Wore them every day! They were a lifesaver at work. But today, I put them on and the right side felt funny. It's because sometime between putting them down on my desk and picking them up to put on, the connection between the earpiece and the headset part of the headphones broke. Now rather than lying flat against my head the ear piece flaps out ({head} |\{earpiece} rather than {head}|/{earpiece}). This means that other noises can get in and do.Basically, I loved these headphones, but after two months of daily use, they broke in such a way to make them uncomfortable and not a bit noise muffling.",1,1,2019-2-28,1,1,0
"I bought these headphones to replace Sony MDRXB950BT headphones I had for about 3 years before I broke them.  These headphones are a great replacement.  I like the sound quality and noise cancellation.  My Sony ones were about $90 and didnt have noise cancelling or a microphone.  For the $60 price tag here, I don't think you'll find better headphones with noise cancelling and a microphone.  If you are looking for over the ear headphpones, I would reccomend these.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"Was looking to upgrade a cheap pair I bought at Walmart for less than $20. At most these were a step sideways at 3x the price. May even be worse. Weird scratching noise that sounds like interference with something (neither of the two other Bluetooth devices I use do this though). Saying these have noise cancellation is  a stretch, and they have absolutely horrible range. Go around a wall and you lose connection.",1,1,2019-7-18,1,1,0

This is a great value for noise cancelling headphones. This can be used with or without cables.  I use this with both my computer (wired) when doing conference calls and wireless (Bluetooth) with my iPhone.  Works well in both modes.  I also like the fact that I can use it while connected to the power cable and charging.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.Their customer service is top notch!  Alina and Jack from Cowin reached out to me when I had a problem with the first set that I bought and promptly helped me out so that I can get a replacement unit quickly.,5,1,2018-3-22,1,0,0
Well I have had them for several weeks now and they are great. One of the best things is the battery life. Charged them the other day and had used them a couple times for online meeting maybe an hour each time. Yesterday used them for a meeting and forgot to shut them off. Tonight had another meeting and they lasted for the whole meeting even after being on for over 24 hours.They are very comfortable to wear even for a couple of hours straight. And for me the sound clarity is wonderful.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"These headphones are awesome!! At first, I also had a problem of low volume and I noticed some of the reviewers did too. I just found the fix and it works perfectly now, now I can raise the volume and it gets VERY loud, too loud! This fix is for the iPhone/iPad : go to « settings », then « music », then « volume limit » has to be on « off ».  This fixed the problem instantly! Hope this helps! These are GREAT headphones, sound quality is phenomenal!",5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0
These are incredible!! They come in a very nice box with a carrying case for the headphones. The warranty is outstanding 24months and 90day return policy! When i put my headphones i was pleasantly surprised at the crisp sound. These are perfect! It took less than 4hours to fully charge and the battery lasts 30hours!! These were definitely worth it! I did not expect such top quality for less then 50$.  Great purchase i will buy cowin products again.,5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I don't see a mute button on the headphone. I don't want to use mute on the phone itself. Sometimes I leave a phone charging and I walk in other parts of the house during a call, but I would not be able to mute/unmute it during my calls. Noise cancelling exists, but I don't think is close to the Bose headphones.....I know the price is different.I also realised that you can't use noise cancellation when using wired connection, like when you connect to plane's entertainment systems.",4,1,2017-2-24,1,3,0
"I bought this product back in March of 2019, and the left side suddenly stopped working all together.  I only the use headphones in the office so I can't believe they can't handle that environment.  I wrote Cowin 4 days ago and have yet to hear from them.  I'll update this if I hear anything from them.  If I don't update that means they don't stand behind their product as much as they say they do and I have moved on and will not be buying another COWIN product.Thank you!",1,1,2019-12-30,1,2,0
"The Cowin E7 headphones are lightweight and comfortable. They linked easily to Alexa and my phone, producing excellent sound quality. Plenty of operating time off of each charge. On the negative, the sound-cancelling capabilities are hard to distinguish, but still much better than earbuds.I am not a discerning audiophile, I just enjoy listening to music everyday. These headphones allow me to play my music when and how loudly I choose without disturbing the entire house or being disturbed by ambient noise around me",4,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"When I received them I had a time figuring out how to set them up on new device so they could mention the instructions in a more way that us idiots know what to do. Please mention that these can be used for regular headphones not just Bluetooth use. but they kick a** and you must get a new if just for the noise cancelling feature, I can now ignore my kitties when they want to eat early. Well worth it.",5,1,2018-12-13,1,1,0
"I use the headphones while riding my John Deere Lawn Tractor and cutting the 1 acre of my lawn. The sound quality is unbelievable, especially the Bass quality. The noise cancelling also cuts out a lot of the tractor engine noise. It makes the job of cutting my lawn for 2.5 hours a lot more enjoyable while using the Headphones in Bluetooth mode with Music from my Smartphone. Previously the headphones I used contained an AM/FM radio where the reception would cut out, depending where is was in my yard, and also did not have a Noise cancelling feature.I truly feel that these E7 Headphones are Well worth the money and highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0
"Edit: The first set I received (E7) had really bad sound quality so COWIN sent me a new pair of SE7's and they are great. The music quality is as good as I could hope for.If you're getting these for meetings or to watch DIY videos they're fine. They're reasonably comfortable too. If, however, you plan on listening to music, stay far away from these. I've tried several different sites with music and they all sound as if the speaker has been put under water it's so muffled. It reminds me of being a kid in the 80's listening to tapes of recordings we took off the radio. These are just so bad.",4,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I have had these headphones now for about 8 months now, and I will say the sound quality is still as good as it was when I first got it. The noise cancelling part works well enough that it does not mute everything around you but it does make everything much more quite which allows you to hear the sound better.As far as comfort ability, after 3 to 4 hours of continuous use, you may need to rest your ears a bit as it sometimes hurts. The pain is not bad, but it can be annoying. I have had several other similar priced headphones and this particular one is the best one out of everything I have used in this price point. The sound, durability, and comfort level of these head phones beats out anything else in this price range.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"They work pretty well. They don't have as much bass as I would expect. They connect to my phone, and my computer via bluetooth pretty quickly. The buttons and switch are pretty nice. The only weird thing is that the volume down button is on top, so that's counter intuitive. And there's a fake decal button on the left side. They are VERY comfortable. Even with glasses. They due cut in and out when in bluetooth mode, which is expected, and tolerable. The switch on the bottom is actually kind of dumb because there's no bump to indicate which way is ""off"" or ""anc"" so I've turned them off when trying to activate the active noise cancelling a few times. I guess you just have to memorize it. Overall I think they are worth the money. I find it nice that it has a standard usb micro port and an aux port.",4,1,2017-7-24,1,0,0
"My husband heard about another product similar to Cowin E7 and wanted to try them. I was not fan of how big and bulky they were so I started looking and found the Cowin E7 loved they were smaller, had a built in microphone, Bluetooth and were noise reducing. I also loved the color. I purchased them for Christmas for my husband. He opened them, charged them and started testing them. After paurung them with his phone ( and having me call him several times) he paired them with our TV and that was it... he was like a kid...this is the best Christmas present ever.. Oh and he lives that it comes with the pouch.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"I waited to write a review until I had given these time.  I bought these May 7, 2019, it is now January 9, 2020.  I can tell you they are still like brand new (see pictures) and I use them every single day at work.  You can't go wrong with his purchase.  My phone can be at my desk and I can walk all the way over past the printer, perhaps 20ft-25ft.  I am bad with distance without measuring but I can tell you that there are 2 cubes, a wall, and hallway in-between.  They stay charged for at least 3 days.  Noise cancelling, pretty good.  I guess it depends on how high you have your volume as well.  I have had people have to tap me on the shoulder, my volume is at about half.  I gave four stars because of the weight of them, but it looks like the news ones maybe lighter.  For the price of $59.99, I would still buy these again.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,1
"I bought these for my daughter as we were going to be doing a lot of traveling over the Christmas holiday.  I wanted her to have noise canceling, but not spend a huge amount of money.These headphones are nice and she said they were comfortable.  They also paired nicely with her tablet.",2,1,2019-4-22,1,2,0
"I don’t really use the noise cancellation much so I will not go in to this aspect but the sound is great and it was so very simple to link it with my iPad. They are comfortable to wear around the house when I don’t want to bother others with a show I’m watching. The care taken in packaging, display, and the contact by the company was very nice. One would have thought I purchased a several hundred dollar pair of head phones by the look of my entire packaging.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I bought these after finding out that my favorite headphones in this price range are no longer in production. I spend a lot of time on my computer (with my headphones on), so I can be pretty rough on them.These paired up easily so I can listen to music, they're wireless, the over-the-ear cuffs are comfortable, even while I'm wearing my glasses, and they look nice, too (added bonus). I feel like the active noise cancelling could work better, but it may be the environment I'm using them in, too. Softer sounds, and background noises that are quieter are definitely eliminated when I'm wearing these, and if I've got music turned on, I can't hear anything else at all, which is glorious.",5,1,2017-8-17,1,0,0
"I've never had noise canceling headphones so it was a real treat.  Ambient (background noises...fans, pumps) sounds are totally cut out. Voices are muffled.

No matter your problem no matter how small, they are professional and diligent to make everything right.",5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"They’re so heavy! I love that they’re great for office use but if you try to use these to workout/run you’ll be very disappointed. It’s going to slide around your head and it doesn’t stay secure. It is good/ok sound quality and noise cancellation but it’s not worth the hassle of getting if you’re using them for activity that requires any type of exertion which is sad because that’s why I bought them. It’s not even that the headphones get sweaty it’s just that they’re so heavy and don’t stay put that it gets to be a hassle wearing them but it’s doable if you don’t care to adjust your headphones while you run or never wear them while you bench or do anything lying down or pushing off of the ground. Basically you’ll probably find them annoying but it’s doable. I just would not ever recommend them. I personally feel like they’re great for at home use but am currently now shopping for a different pair of headphones that are better suited for physical activity. When I’m wearing these at my desk and I’m sitting there doing work at home with these on, they’re just so heavy it hurts my neck. The padding around the headphones are soft and it’s comfortable but it still doesn’t take away the heavy weight aspect of these headphones and how it feels after long term wear.",4,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"I've been using these headphones extremely lightly. Overall, I did like them. They had decent sound quality and battery life. Sometimes had trouble connecting but otherwise I was very pleased.That all said, the swivel joints on the ear pads seem to be extremely weak.

"My wife got these headphones for doing work meetings, she unboxed them paired them, and her first client said she couldn't hear anything and hung up on her.  She called me to confirm.  Total crap sound quality.  Sounded like a Skype phone call from dialup internet.  She used the built in mic from her laptop and called me back to confirm it wasn't the internet.  That call was clear as a bell.  We are returning this and going with a different brand.",1,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I am not well-knowledged in the types of headphones. I usually get a pair maybe ever 5 years or so. Depending on how long they last. So far, I have had these headphones for about 3 weeks or so. The most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. I love the quality of sound that comes out and especially the noise-cancellation. The only complaint I would give it is the fact that it is a bit difficult to put in the carrying bag that comes with the box, and is a bit of a struggle to put it away if you are prone to keep it in a backpack or bag.

"I don't write very many reviews, but I try to write them in the case of a product exceeding expectations.  I bought these headphones in 2017, not knowing anything about the brand, wondering if 'good' headphones can be at such a good price.  Well, they can!  Three years later and they work just as they did on day 1.  I've had a great experience with these headphones.  The base quality could be slightly better, but they're all around great especially for the price.  Highly recommend this product!",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"For $40 these Bluetooth headphones aren't bad. After reading all the other positive reviews I decided to bite as everyone else seems to love them. The actual sound quality really isn't that bad for what you're paying. It's also not great. Some mids and highs sound kinda muddy to me but it's acceptable. Unfortunately, the noise canceling doesn't seem to do much and they also don't get very loud for over-ear headphones. I bought these to use on the train during my commute but since the noise canceling doesn't really do anything, they don't get loud enough to help compensate.  So I'm stuck listening to louder music as I can't make out what people are saying in podcasts or videos.These aren't the most comfortable pair of headphones as my ears do get kinda toasty after a while but they do have decently soft ear cups. Not a fan of the shape of the band as I can't rest them around my neck because the ear cups don't extend far enough. They kinda poke my neck which isn't the most comfortable thing in the world... I wish the ear cups came out further or the band was a bit wider but otherwise not terrible.",3,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0
Best value for the price. would certainly recommend the COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones.  I have done a lot of searching and was skeptical at first. I tried a set for myself and was so pleased I bought another 2 sets for my grandsons. we have all gone through a numerous amount of headphones of all different brands but this one is by far the best on quality for the price.  A big plus is that you can use the traditional cable if Bluetooth is not available. The Bass is great but not overpowering all in all 5 star out of 5. I have mine since December 2019 will see how long they will last. the 24 month warranty at registration certainly give peace of mind.,5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,1

When the product came it was more than I had hoped for.  They are of the highest quality, great sound and great noise cancellation.  What I really like is the ability to turn the noise cancellation on or off (for the times when I need to hear my wife calling me for dinner).What you are really interested in is if the product works - yes it does and I am please with it.

Of course, the ANC isn't going to be Bose or Sony quality but they're also a sixth of the price.  The ANC works for buses and crowded streets, if the music is up loud enough, you won't hear anything else.  It doesn't do a great job at tuning out high pitched frequencies (female voices, phone calls, etc) but for the most part, you won't notice the sounds around you.

The noise cancellation works with both Bluetooth and wired. The only thing I don't like is my set with have sound drop a little if you rattle the headphones s little. It's not common or that noticable and could be the active noise cancellation compensating for the noise.

I was scared that the material used was going to make it look cheap, but I actually like the way it looks.

However when I was in another room and the dishwasher could be heard as a constant buzz the NC did eliminate any trace of it.  I also tried out the NC setting when I was mowing the lawn, and it barely had any noticeable effect. The headphones only needed to be 1/2 turned up on volume to enjoy music over the lawnmower, but I could still hear it.  Perhaps NC is only effective for noises in the distance and not in close proximity? I'm not sure, but it wasn't that impressive. Everything else is very nice and of great value comfort, sound quality, battery run time, etc.I might suggest spending a little more on another model if Noise Canceling is of primary concern. Otherwise these are fantastic for the price.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Follow up:The company immediately provided a new set of headphones and was VERY quick. I'm extremely happy with the customer service and the new pair of headphones provided, would absolutely recommend trying these out.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"These headphones were fantastic for a year and a half. I used them to listen to music and I was very happy with them. They canceled noise well, and I didn't have to worry about pesky wires. This changed about 2 weeks ago. They started making a very irritating buzzing in the right speaker, and stopped pairing with my phone a week later. I was expecting to use them for longer than 18 months, considering the price. They were not durable and I don't recommend them.",2,1,2019-6-13,1,3,0
I received my headphones in the time stated. I purchased them for noise canceling feature as I was preparing to take a plane trip.The set I received did not provide good noise cancelling and the sound was mediocre. I wrote a review of the product and moved on.,4,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"These are awesome headphones for the price! I think they actually sound better than my $300 Bose headphones that I bought a few years ago. The only thing the Bose ones did better was noise cancelling. The noise cancelling on these is only okay in my opinion. I can still hear certain environmental sounds that I couldn't ever hear with the Bose headphones. Otherwise, these headphones are better in every way. Very nice bass and they look cool too. I highly recommend them!Edit: Also, this is kind of a silly complaint, but the voice that tells you to charge the headphones when the battery is low says ""Please charging!"" They really couldn't have double checked the grammar on that? lol",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Great pair of ANC headphones! For the money, truly very good. They're entirely plastic, so please don't think you're getting really sturdy metal ones (the photos make it look metal - it's chrome). So knowing this up-front will make you less disappointed. Reassuring to me that I recently saw someone else with a pair of these on a flight - so they're gaining popularity. So yes, they're not Bose or Sony, but they're a VERY comparable replacement for the money. Tight yet very comfortable on the head, too!",5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
After a month & a half the Bluetooth capabilities no longer gets found on the pairing list even the headphone light won't turn blue & white like it used to. It stays white now I paid $60 for this only for it to not work a little after a month??? I've had $20 headphones that lasted a year and then some... While I admit the sound quality is much better than cheaper headphones the fact that it won't do it's job as BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES in such a short time is horrific to say the least. Seems like a cash grab to me.,2,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"I like them a lot. The noise cancelling definitely works, and I can have the headphones on full volume and my coworkers can't hear anything.Only downside is the noise-cancelling feature while walking outdoors or while listening at a low volume. When listening at a low volume, a pulsing noise is emitted which can be a bit nauseating. When walking outdoors, the bluetooth will often skip. This is fixed however by switching over to the non-noise cancelling Bluetooth mode.",4,1,2017-4-13,1,1,0
I gave 4 stars for the noise cancelling because it kind of sounds like sealing your ears inside the headphones. It also lowers the sound a little bit. I work around electronic devices at my work and the places gets noisy. These work great without the noise cancelling and I don't even have to adjust the volume. Comfortable to wear when properly adjusted. Making or taking phone calls is also great on sound. The people on the other end can hear me quite clearly. Best value for features. I recommend you try these first before spending more money than you have to.,5,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
"I bought these for my husband because airplane engine noise, crying kids, rustling packages and other sounds bother him.  He only got the chance to use them twice before the world shut down for covid 19 but he really liked them. I found the sound quality a little lower quality than my apple ear pods but we wanted these was to shut noise out not necessarily improve audio quality.  He was happy - so I was happy.  No grumpy faces the entire flight.",4,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I tried airing out these headphones out for a while but it was turning my stomach every time I got close to them. If you love sniffing paint thinner and increasing your cancer risk, then I guess these are the right fit for you. Otherwise, people need to stop settling for cheap, toxic stuff and return it, as I have just now done.Thought I was safe with the quantity of these sold, but that doesn't seem to matter. Perhaps there's a resurgence in the abuse of inhalants? Covid-19 has caused everyone to lose their sense of smell? Very frustrating.",1,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I use these headphones while studying or settling in for the night. I get distracted easily. I put on these headphones, listen to meditation music on low and am good to go.  My daughter also uses these while doing homework. We’ll both be in the kitchen.

"Hey everyone-I don't write reviews often, but wanted to spread the good word about these headphones. For those who are looking for a decent, comfortable, and cheap(er) set of headphones, the Cowin E7's should be a pair you look in to. I bought these back in the winter prior to a trip that included a long plane ride (about 6 hours). The noise cancelling was excellent, surprising really, for a roughly $50 pair of headphones. They were very comfortable, as I wore them for most of the flight, and the battery life was great as well. The sound quality was top notch for the price range, as I didn't have crazy high expectations. I had a pair of Beats for years, but didn't want to drop that much more money on headphones.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"First off I'll say that these headphones are great in sound and in comfort, plus the quality for the price is very good too!The only downside I see In the headphones is that it still needs to run on battery JUST TO USE THE AUX CABLE.  That's the only flaw to these headphones. But battery according to the box is 30hr run time.  But I just find it unnecessary that it needs to be charged now and then.",3,1,2019-5-29,1,1,0
These headphones are good for the price. I bought these for an long international flight. I put these on and was listening to a book and my husband could hear the sound coming out of the headphones when sitting across the table from me. I want something that won’t be at all distruptuve to anyone around me. These may be awesome once the plane is going but I didn’t want to take the chance and be the jerk on the plane for 22 hours. These are a great choice for someone not looking to pay the price for beats or Bose. The seem sturdy and well made.,4,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"These headphones feel pretty well built and battery life has been excellent so far. Sound quality without noise cancelling is not terrible, but loses all bass with it turned on and just sounds like a bad radio. If you are looking for noise cancelling while playing music. When used with a podcast or audio book, the NC seems to be fine.  If you want to use NC and music, look else where.Update: I was contacted by customer support, where they said they would send me an updated version of the headset in 5 to 7 days. It is now well past that time and not updated version has arrived so I lowering my review a star.",2,1,2017-7-14,1,4,0
"I wanted something to use around the house and acreage.  I seriously considered the Bose QC35 but couldn't justify the $300 price range.  After reading many reviews, I decided to give these Cowin E7's a try.  I had never heard on the brand, but was willing to give them a chance. I'm glad I did.  They look a little flashy, but they are functional.  The newer model has a more subtle look for another $20-$30.  I'm fine with these.  They were easy to pair to my iPhone XR.  I tried vacuuming with the noise cancellation, but it didn't help that much for that kind of noise.  I wanted to listen to TV/Stereo , but will have to get a Bluetooth transmitter.  These E7's are quite comfortable , and have a decent amount of bass.  I'm hoping the noise cancellation works better in other listening situations.  Basically, they seem a bargain for the price point.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I am a bit disappointed with these headphones, given the glowing reviews.  The sound quality is fine when listening to music.  I connected them to my iPhone and they are perfectly adequate.  However, that is not why I bought them.  I purchased them to use for conference calls in my office.  I connected them to my Cisco phone without issue, but upon using for my first call, I was immediately told that there was a ton of static and the audio quality was horrible.  I had to mute myself.  I thought, ok, maybe it was just that call.  However, the next call, same thing.  I had to disconnect and re-join with a wired headset.  I thought, ok, maybe it's the Cisco phone, so I connected them to my iPhone and tried a couple of calls.  Same result.  The users said that it sounded like I was in a tin can and it was staticky.  I'm now very frustrated.  I didn't need another pair of headphones for music.  I need a good noise-canceling headset for WebEx meetings.  These might be going back!",2,1,2019-9-20,1,1,0
Pros: - ANC works well.- Sounds is very good,5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Nothing much really ""wows"" me anymore. I find most things to be OK (or not), but these headphones are the exception. First of all, the packaging is top-notch. The box is beautiful and feels and look as though these headphones were worth way more than what I paid for them. The headphones themselves are nestled and protected inside the box perfectly. The cushioned headband and ear pieces adds to the comfort level of this sleek and sturdy set. It took me 2 seconds to pair it with my laptop and begin listening to music. Does it cancel out noise? In a word, yes. As a swimmer, I feel like I am underwater with these on, even with nothing coming through as they just shut the noise of the rest of the world out. The sound is absolutely wonderful, very balanced and perfectly pleasant. I bought these for my disabled son who really needed a good pair of noise cancelling headphones and they really are so wonderful, I'll likely be getting a pair for myself.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
The headphones are great comfortable but a but bulky as my head is not that big. After a few month they got slack and after a few more months one side came apart. They still work and I patched it up with some electrical tape. Build quality is a bit lackingThe ANC is great and let's me concentrate when I need some quiet.,4,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"Ok, so where to begin. Realistically, 5 star reviews don’t usually give enough details but here it is : I LOVE when my headphones are super loud so I always have the volume all the way up and this normally causes distortion and makes it sound like you have a bad signal on the radio, but with these no matter the volume the sound quality is still phenomenal. The material in the ear cuffs is so freaking comfortable and they actually look good, I didn’t think they would be as sleek and stylish as the pictures showed them but they are really nice, although I am giving 5 stars here are some reasons others might not that I noticed but wasn’t bothered by: the buttons are cheap feeling, I am not sure how to explain it but they just feel funny and the way the controls are on the same one makes it a little more complicated to use, which doesn’t affect me because I use my phone for navigating my music and the volume controls still work also since I blare my music as loud as possible anyways this last one doesn’t bother me but the maximum volume low-key turns your headphones into speakers which I like but others might see as inconvenient. All the attachments and the storage bag are very nice. I appreciate that I have the option of bluetooth or wired and was very pleased that they came fully charged. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy again!",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"These Cowin E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones are right up there with the more expensive brand name ones. I've used them mostly with my cell phone and once it is set up, it automatically pairs with my phone bluetooth when turned on. I've used them plugged in as well with my non-bluetooth MP3 player and it works wonderfully. They also worked very well for talking on the phone; I was told they could hear me loud and clear.The sound quality is crisp and clear. However, the noise cancelling feature is a little lacking. It worked well to block out quieter sounds like the washing machine, television and dishwasher but not as great to block out the excess noise on the airplane. I mean, they worked and blocked out some of the airplane noise but not as much as I had hoped. However, I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend these.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0
"At first these seemed complicated. (I have brain damage in 2 places on my left frontal lobe) so understanding what I am reading can be a challenge. My daughter taught me how to use them. It isn't complicated at all. I did get startled one time though. Playing a sinister hidden object game, all into it when  the headphones said 'Please charge"" Ahh! Umm ok.. dang it man. Glad I am not incontinent. LOL! These are worth every penny and are so easy to use I highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"Had been eye balling these for a while until i finally bit the bullet and bought a pair, and I've been anything but disappointed.  I'm not necessarily an audiophile but have to hear all the ranges in a song.  These deliver great quality throughout the spectrum, and you'll be able to pick out everything in the high mids and lows.  Highs and mids are crisp and clear, and the bass is full and encompassing.  By no means with it fell like you have subwoofers strapped to each ear but it beautifully fills out the bottom end and makes the music sound whole and complete.  I don't have a great need for the noise cancelling but it works well and kills out the 3d printers constantly going in the room and the only thing i can hear are the great sounds being pumped into my ear holes.  Would these be good in a studio setting for the professional mixer putting together the next great track?  There's probably better options but for the consumer of the next great track these are spot on.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"Bought these before Christmas for my laptop,1st thing I noticed is if you plug them in you have to move the cord around in the headset to make a good connection. The sound quality 2 stars at best. The bass is just ok. Also if you don't turn the power switch off after using them it is about a 4 hour recharge time before they can be used again. Mabey they should shut off after 1 hour of inactivity? Also all the controls are the same colors as the headsets and are impossible to see in low light. I would not recommend buying any COWIN products.",2,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"The E7 set of over the ear headphones are great for the price.  Noise cancelling works well. They are comfortable to wear for long time. The audio is great for the price, workmanship at this level is superb! while this headset is not up to audiophile standards, it is a good place to start. I use mine for music and late night movies.I would buy again, and tell anyone looking that here is a pair that will last for long time to come.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
These are great headphones for the price.  Rotating ear phones do tend to break with mild rough handling by teens but Cowin has been terrific with product support.

"Totally satisfied for the price - for 60 bucks I had everything my friends had with their 300 dollar Beats and Bose rigs - except one thing.  Cheap storage bag and flimsy plastic construction.  The part that provides all the adjustability turns out to literally be the weakest link.  After a few weeks, earpiece broke off rendering the unit utterly worthless.  I am an adult and treat my electronics with ease.  I cannot recall the event or condition that precipitated this break, but these really need a hard case and better engineering.  Advice: buy a 25 dollar set and lose the bells and whistles, or buy a 300 dollar set and spare yourself the disappointment.",2,1,2020-7-24,1,1,0
"They are very good headphones intially you see i got mines on the tenth of october  and they were great great sound ,bass ,and sound quality but the next day (today) i went to go use them i turned them off the night before so the charge would stay it was fully charged but i go to turn them on and its not turning on so i look and see the switch is only half way so okay simple mistake i put it in charge from 8 in the morning to now it 10 at night and its still not turning on so truthfully every otjer review is talking about how great they are so am not sure if i just got a defective but overall its good just buy at your oen risk and hopefully the owners of cowin will see thus reveiw cause i live in the Caribbean so i paided basically double the price for these headphones only for them to stop workin the next day is really frustrating so if the owners see this maybe we can cone to some kind of a deal or something or maybe some advice to rectify the problem thanks.",2,1,2019-10-11,1,1,0
"For an inexpensive pair of headphones,  these are great! The sound quality is excellent and the noise cancelation is great.  They're very comfortable and don't bother me even if I wear them all day while working.  Down sides:  the microphone picks up every little sound, so it's a little noisy for whomever you're taking to.  Also,  the Bluetooth range is very short.  I lose connection if I leave the phone on the table and walk down to the end of the hallway in my home (10-15 steps).",4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"Just keep in mind these cost $70.  They're OK and for what you pay good value.  They are easy to pair and connect to the devices I use, just be sure they are disconnected for one device before trying to connect to another. Took me ages to work that one out as there are no meaningful instructions accompanying them. Being wireless means I can roam the apartment, although they doesn't like too many walls between them and the device as the connection can be broken.  Been using them for about two weeks and sound is quite good.  I've not had any complaints about sound leakage from my follow travellers or those around, mind you I don't have them any near max nor with heavy bass as I'm grateful the 17th and 18th century composers hadn't had access to sound mixers.  NC blocks out alot of the white noise, not all, but that's OK it is better than having no NC particularly when there's apartments being built nearby.",4,1,2017-2-25,1,1,0
"I bought a pair of these after my last pair broke. I thought the original item was just a defect but it appears not to be the case. These are good for about seven to eight months before they break.

"These are great! I recently ramped up my fitness program with trips to the gym and that place is so loud. These are making it possible to spend time there without damaging my hearing. I put them on, turn on noise cancellation and Quiet. I look forward to my workouts much more now that I don't have to deal with the racket (I'm sure the sound in the 'damages hearing' range). I can hear my own music or audio books or video easily at low volumes. I have good hearing and would like it to last so this is a great improvement. When I use my earbuds or regular over the ear headphones at the gym, I'd have to turn up the volume really high to hear over the racket. And that's no good for the long term.They are comfortable for 90 minutes of wear and seem to be handling the sweat. I just dry them off with a towel during and after cardio. I haven't ever had battery life problems but haven't really tested that. I also look forward to using these on planes and at my desk once our new open floor plan furniture is installed.",5,1,2017-10-23,1,0,0
"We bought our first pair in January 2017, which I used mainly for air travel.  They do a great job of cancelling out the ambient in-air noise on the plane!  My wife doesn't like in-ear headphones, so tried these and found them to be very comfortable - so we bought her a pair.  In April 2020, I bought another pair to use on our TV in the bedroom.  And the first pair still works as good as it did 3+ years ago!  Absolutely great value for high quality noise-cancelling headphones!",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I really like these headphones. While it doesn't completely block outside ambient noise, it definitely cuts it out enough that I'm not too aware of it, and I don't have to boost the volume to drown anything out. The sound is great - love the bass. Only a tiny bit muffled in the upper ends.They've taken a beating and still work well, pairing is quick and simple. Controls on it are good, too.",4,1,2017-11-15,1,0,0
"These headphones are probably good enough for a casual user. For me, no. Why? The sound quality isn't very great and it gets worse with noise cancellation on. The headphones are comfortable but not after an hour or 2. The headphones just aren't loud enough and I sometimes have to use audio software to improve it. The bass is ok but not much. These headphones haven't died on me yet though, the battery is great. Capable of lasting 2 days on one charge unless you you use them more than 12hrs a day. The packaging was very nice and came with a 3.5mm wire, charger, bag, manual, and thank you card. Using the headphones wired isn't very good though as there is a constant high pitch buzzing. If you're looking for cheap bluetooth headphones with good sound quality, these aren't the ones. You can get better sound quality for less. But if you don't really care go at it. Yeah",3,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"For a no name brand, these earphones are great. I use them to workout without having those cumbersome wires in the way. The battery charge lasts a while, and the sound quality is great. The bass level for these headphones are superb if you like that. The volume levels are press buttons on the side of the headphones. The noise cancellation is pretty good as I cannot hear the other people in the room when playing my music loud enough.

"I have to be honest, I almost think these sound better than the Bose Q35.  In terms of Noice Canceling, the Bose are the hands down winners.  These lose quality when the NC is turned on.  But when using normal sound, I think these actually sound better than the Bose.  I recommended to a friend and he absolutely loves them as well.Things to note: In normal environments, you do not need the NC.  I promise, with just normal sound, these headphones act as if they have passive NC.  On a plane, you definitely need NC and you will be thankful for it.  Again, NC not as good as Bose.  But general sound, just as good if not better than Bose.",5,1,2018-2-28,1,1,0
"These headphones are excellent and provide a well rounded sound across treble, mids and bass. I also own a set of Bose QC15 noise cancelling as well as Audio Technica noise cancelling headphones -- the Cowin E-7 compare very well, They have more bass than the Bose, without being overwhelming. It is very easy to pair these with your phone or tablet, even for a non-technical person, and once paired it will connect automatically again once your device has Bluetooth turned on and the button on the Cowin is put in the Bluetooth position...super easy! Recently I used these on a few flights to Europe, they blocked the airplane noise very well, and the battery life is insane !! Well over 20 hours on one charge - impressive. They were also quite comfortable to wear over the long 9 hour,  plane ride. Very pleased and for the price, I highly recommend. These are a hidden gem!",5,1,2017-7-28,1,1,0
"Sound quality could be described as mediocre only if these were sub-$10 headphones. No advanced bluetooth codecs like Apt-X are supported, the sound over bluetooth is muffled and distorted to the point that it almost hurts to listen, and no, I am not picky about ""sound stage"", ""vocal crispness"" or similar audiophille buzzwords.Noise cancellation works, and soft ambient office noise is indeed reduced to the level of almost complete silence, but distinctive sounds like keyboard clicks or pencil drop pass through easily and are heard pretty well. Headphones are open type and your colleagues sitting nearby can (and will) hear or will probably be irritated by music that you suppose to listen privately, even when listening at low volume level.",2,1,2019-3-6,1,1,0
"First, I am one to write quality reviews when products are good. I don't understand how this is so highly rated. The AUX cable, when plugged into a call if moved, disconnects the call. The headphones need to be charged to use even if you plug the cord into a device/workstation which defeats the purpose of purchasing these for work. Feel free to tell me I am wrong or that the one I have is defective but this is no better than a $20 set of earbuds outside of slightly better sound quality.",2,1,2019-10-29,1,1,0
"I loved these headphone, but had to return them because the microphone is so bad it was useless. If i could have turned off the mic I would have kept them because they're light and great looking. Alas, without a functioning microphone they were pointless for me.",1,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"The battery lasts about 7 hours of play. Good for sound cancelling headphones buy be sure to turn them of if not in use. The sound canceling effect is a little weak but sufficient with music on to drown out the sounds on an airplane in flight. I've used high end Bose that with no music you couldn't hear a person yelling in your face. These are not those, but those also cost 10 times as much as these. I would recommend these for a good quality sound for not a bad price. The only problem I had is they are warm like ear muffs, they could be vented a little better.",5,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0
"So, I've been using these headphones for about three weeks now. The sound quality is great, and they seem solidly built. They last for quite a long time on a single charge (I haven't actually timed it yet, but I've only had to fully recharge them maybe three times since my purchase). I don't really know much about the technology of noise cancellation, and have never used noise-cancelling headphones before, but that feature seems to work well.My only wish is that the ""skip track"" buttons and the ""volume"" buttons were their own separate buttons. But other than that, I don't have anything bad to say about them.",4,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I've had these headphones for 2 years and they've just now broken and only because someone knocked them over by accident. The break is with the band, not the headphones themselves. They are in perfect working order after a great deal of abuse.The noise cancellation was jarring at first but unlike most noise canceling headphones they never gave me earaches. It cuts out a great deal of low volume chatter and other noises. I could walk through Penn station and feel fairly isolated.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"First point of disclosure is that I returned mine...This for me was purely a sound quality decision.  I liked the build quality and didn't really try the noise cancelling.  This system had acceptable sound quality that I expect probably 75% of the people out there would find these completely acceptable if not great sounding.  For me the sound lacked brightness, depth and bass.  I found the packaging and build quality a 5 stars but for me the sound quality wasn't worth the price.  You can buy in the ear headphones with this sound quality at around $30- but without the noise cancellation and build quality.",3,1,2018-3-21,1,1,0
I bought these headphones2 years ago. IFly2 to 3 times a month that's the only time I use them. I bought the additional case because there is no way you could keep these safe any other way. The battery life is amazing sometimes I only charge them once a month and that's after using them all month. The noise cancelling is a step below Bose. But if I am watching a movie with these on I hear nothing else in the plane ever. Yes they seem a little flimsy so I do treat them with care and would suggest people buy them.,5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"Used these on a recent trip to Europe that involved several 5-9 hour flights. And they made a huge difference. Sound quality is good, they are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they block out quite a bit of noise even without the active noise cancelation turned on. I've never owned any of the high end, and expensive, noise canceling headphones, so I can't compare the performance of the Cowins to those, but they are a big improvement over the in ear headphones that come with your phone, or to the disposable on ear headphones they will sell you on the plane.

"I bought two pairs at the same time and my boyfriend and I use them pretty regularly. I think the sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is pretty good. I will say that after about 6 months, my boyfriend's headphones would make the sound of turning on when they weren't even being touched. Now almost a year after having them, his pair will CONSTANTLY make that noise when they're off! It's really distracting when you're not using them, but if they're on they are fine. I have had no issues with mine. Aside from that little hiccup, I think they are worth the money.",4,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"Daughter loved the comfort and quality of these headphones, but just a few days ago the left side stopped working.  She uses these daily with her iPad and the bluetooth and the sound quality are really good when it works.  I had expected these headphones to last longer than just 6 months (she got these as a Christmas gift).  Not sure if this is a rampant problem or I just got a bad lot#.  Will check to see if their warranty is decent site says 12 months or 24 months if you register your product.",1,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"bought 3 pairs of these now.  very nice sound quality and noise cancelling.  mostly comfortable. my ears get a little sore after several hours.  The padding is very good, i think my ears might be a little too large.  my kids do not complain at all.  Son using in dorms to lock out sound to study.I am somewhat of an audiophile and will say the sound is probably the best you can get for the money.  you can get some that sound better but will cost you more than double.  the connectivity is easy and always connects and the buttons are nice and easy to use and very functional.  i would recommend and will buy again.",5,1,2018-3-3,1,0,0
"These glare fantastic headphones! I suggest them to friends and coworkers every chance i get. They sound fantastic. I use them at home . ( which my wife loves, because she doesn’t have to hear the game I’m playing or the movie I’m gonna watching) Which both sound great, thanks to the dynamic range of the headphones.I listen to them at the gym and while we am out working on the yard.",5,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"Overall the sound quality is so great only if noise cancelling is turned off. With noise cancelling on; I get muddy bass tone sound that will drown out highs frequencies. As your best bet; use high powered BLUETOOTH 5.0 because from 30 feet range from smaller transmitter, this headphones has cutting out do to with built in direction receiving antenna. Overall for price of this headphones, the wireless has the sound quality as those with wire type headphones.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"These are great headphones. Rich bass, balanced sound, and a comfortable fit. They do make my ears a little hot when wearing for long periods of time, but that's probably to be expected. Connectivity was easy with both my Apple computer and iPhone. Can switch between the devices easily. Not as easily as AirPods, but better than other products I've tried. All in all, for the price, these are a great choice. Used them on 2 plane trips earlier this year and was able to block out almost all the engine noise from the plane.",4,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"After four months of daily use in my office - I'm rather pleased with these bluetooth, noise dampening headphones.I usually combine the active noise canceling with white noise or something similar (e.g. noisli or nature sounds on youtube).",5,1,2017-10-24,1,0,0
"If you LOVE MUSIC.....BUY these Headphones!!!  I am NOT a review writer....ever.  But, my first-day experience listening to my favorites bands...QUEEN, FOO FIGHTERS, GRETA VAN FLEET....via these headphones - I am BLOWN AWAY!!!!  I feel like I’ve listened in Studio while they’ve recorded my favorite songs;  been in the front row while Brazil sang “Love of my Life”, back to Freddi Mercury.  I am not exaggerating,  these headphones are crazy!!!  I’ve had three different styles of Beats headphones and they did not do this.Period.  I can’t tell you how long they last....I am in my first day.  But I bought a warranty on Amazon and register them on the website.  BTW, They arrived in a fancy-schmancy black box with a thank you note from the creator :) and a VIP card redeemable for free ear buds and a UNICEF donation card...and a carrying fabric case.",5,1,2018-11-24,1,1,0

"I have had these headphones for about a month (received on April 21, 2020), and I am quite happy with them.Something I didn't notice until receiving them: On the outside of the right ear piece there are three buttons. If you press them once they correspond to next-track, pause, previous-track, and if you hold them they correspond to volume up, bluetooth off, volume down.  Pretty nifty to consolidate these actions into three buttons. My only complaint is that the small surface that holds this interface is kind of wobbly and feels like it could be easily popped out.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,1
This has to be one my best investments when it comes to headphones. I always use to just grab a pair of wired headphones for 5 bucks at any store and by 2-3 weeks one or both sides would go out. So I decided to research and came across the COWIN E7 and they are amazing!!Likes:,5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"As a student I listen to music for at least 7 hours everyday. I've been using these recently and I'm very impressed. They have a very sleek design and they're very comfortable (they fit over my ears just right). It asks you to charge them for 8 hours before you start using them, I've now used them for around 20 hours and it still says they're 90% charged (I'm not sure how accurate that is, but I can update and let you all know the amount of play time I get out of them with the initial charge). It comes with an aux cord, a charging cable, and a drawstring bag as well. The instruction manual has a lot of different languages, so reading the instructions shouldn't be an issue, they're very simple and easy to understand. The sound quality is pretty impressive for the price. I personally prefer the noise cancelling setting, because I enjoy zoning out without hearing people near me. I will say; if there are very loud people within close proximity, you will have to turn the volume up a tad bit. The bass is probably one of my favorite things about it, I listen to a lot of lofi and having good bass really means a lot.Overall this is a solid pair of headphones, I'd say if you have the extra money and are looking to invest in a good pair of bluetooth headphones, go for these ones.",4,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0
I like these headphones. They are high quality. Soft padding on the ears and head(an I have a bald head so very comfortable)Battery life is very surprisingly incredible.,4,1,2018-1-20,1,1,0
"These are great headphones. The build is there. They are cheap feeling nor is the sound quality been compromised. The noise cancellation works very well for, but I use them 99% time watching a streaming service online at home. I cannot tell how they would do outside, but they cancel out the noises I hear from my loud neighbor, the HVAC unit or my fans. I would also say they are a great value. Check out some of the discounts offered",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
Just got these headphones today. First impression is that for the price of $70 they are a very good value. I was a bit worried that the ANC would not be very effective but surprisingly it works perfectly. The whole neighborhood is under construction and these headphones have blocked out the noise effectively; with the volume set low i can no longer hear any background noise at all. I tried a friends bose headphones  recently and these have similarly effective ANC.I'm no expert on audio quality but these headphones have good audio quality. Compared to my $120 set of V-moda headphones they reproduce sound almost as well. High notes sound excellent. My V-moda headset has marginally better bass.,5,1,2017-8-10,1,1,0
"Excellent headphones especially for the low price! I don't use headphones too often, usually just when I travel so I didn't want to spend hundreds on a pair. The noise cancellation works well on these and they deliver excellent sound quality. They have a good amount of bass which is important to me. There's not a better pair out there for the price. They even look great. They are super comfortable. I've worn them for 4 hours straight and barely felt like they were there. Definitely recommend",5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"Great headphones for the price. It’s convenient for those early morning bus rides with very talkative older ladies. A charging cord, cable wire (instead of using Bluetooth all the time), a small leather carrying bag and a thank you note is included in the box. There are three different switches; an off switch, a blue tooth switch and a noise canceling switch. I don’t use the noice canceling switch because it personally makes me feel congested, like I’m in a stuffy room. The only reason I’m giving this four stars is because the Headphones are a bit tight on my head. I do appreciate the swivel ear parts, those come in handy when I don’t want to wear the full headphones. Totally worth it’s price. Recommend to anyone and everyone.",4,1,2018-5-7,1,1,0
"I was concerned about buying noise canceling headphones from a company I wasn’t familiar with but so happy I made the purchase.Not only do they look great, feel great and sound great, the value is outstanding.",4,1,2017-12-10,1,0,0
Pros- I particularly like that it is true to its detailed and overall design. People compliment me all the time at the gym and say they’re going to get one. I’ve tried many headphones and Cowan E7 for me is on the same level as beats headphones but Cowan is more affordable. Highly recommendCowan.,5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,1
"Very satisfied with the performance of these headphones, but would like to know the actual rating for noise-cancelling.  I like to listen to books as I mow the lawn, and cranking the volume up in the headphones to drown out the mower seems counter-productive.  Bluetooth works well, and they certainly are an improvement over my old headphones, but perhaps not as good as the ones that have a 25db cancellation rating in my shop.Somewhat more comfortable than others, but still get ear compression over time.",4,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"I bought these as a gift for my husband because it got Excellent reviews and was very reasonably priced.  Unfortunately when I received them, I found out that I do not have a bluetooth enabled TV.  That was the only reason I sent them back.I will say that they are very comfortable and nice looking and a great deal.  I also was very pleased with the Customer Service we received and the fast refund.  It is nice to know that this company stands behind their warranty and great customer service!",5,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0
"I'm really disappointed first off with the poor connection. As I write this I am sitting in front of my laptop which its connected to, dealing with crunchy audio. This should not be an issue at all at this proximity. If I am having a moment of good connection and I leave my device's vicinity, while the poor connection from a distance is expected, when I return to a good proximity the audio remains poor and will not self-correct, causing me to have to reset the headphones.Secondly, and the main reason I cannot keep these headphones, is because it does not have any piratical level of noise canceling. The audio can clearly be heard when music is played at a normal level in any quiet space. I would not be able to use public study spaces with these. They can also be heard easily enough in a normal noise level environment. This is the most frustrating point, as noise canceling is one of these headphones main features.",2,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
"Wouldn’t recommend. I’ve had them for less than 5 months and while they were good at first, the battery life gets worse and every time I bend over during yard work, they get static. I bought my daughter a pair of headphones for $25 and hers are better than mine.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"I love these headphones (we have multiple pairs)!  They are comfortable to wear and have very little sound leakage.  We have tried several other headphones in the $75 range and these are the best!  Long battery life, clear sound and look great! The most impressive thing is the customer service provided by Cowin...the small screws connecting the ear piece to the headband broke so I reached out to see if it could be repaired (the headphones still worked but the ear piece was wobbly).  Cowin responded within 15 minutes, asked a few questions, apologized and sent me a brand new pair via Amazon!  It's rare to deal with a company that truly stands behind their product and comes through when you need them!  We will be Cowin customers for life!",5,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0
"After 3 or 4 other passive noise cancelling headphones with unsatisfactory results, I decided to spend a little extra for ACTIVE noise cancelling. The Cowin E7 provided excellent noise reduction in a gym environment with overly loud background noises. I am completely satisfied with the product, and was extremely impressed with the fast (1 day) turnaround at replacing the headphones under warranty, which I discovered was 18 months, not the standard 18 months. I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2018-1-15,1,0,0
"I was in the market for a pair of noise cancelling headphones, but I was having a difficult time accepting the price that they were asking for them. Looking around I stumbled on these Cowin headphones for a 1/3 of the price of the big named ones. While I can't compare them to how they perform to the $300 dollar pair I was initially looking at, I can attest to the fact that these are a great set of headphones with phenomenal sound quality.I am very happy with this purchase, and will most likely be looking for their ""pro"" version in a couple of months and will give these to my son so he can use them.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"There wasn't any nose cancellation as stated. The sound quality is just okay (for the low end price). The sound leaks out from the headphones and is easily audible to nearby people. The build quality doesn't feel as premium as I had expected: the cups rotate rather super freely, and the buttons feel like cheap plastic buttons that could come off easily. The sound quality is decent for the price. But at higher volumes you start to hear noise along with the bass.However, i feel like for around $60, its a decent pair of headphones with kinda average sound quality.",2,1,2020-1-23,1,1,1
"I bought these maybe a year ago.  They paired to my PC no problem, and would auto connect when I turned them on.  Perfect!  For some reason the day I decided to pair to my phone, the BT connection to my PC has never worked again.  I've reset the headphones, made sure they are not connected to anything else, scoured forums, nothing has worked.  Usually my PC will detect them, but then can't connect.  So, 'stuck using them wired which I hate.The ANC is very bad.  It's just a white noise generator.  Sound quality plummets when it's turned on.",2,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"I'm sure there's better noice cancelling headphones out there but these have outlasted a lot of other bluetooth earbuds I've had and they're still going, and as I recall they were cheaper than a lot of others.That said, I used superglue to repair cracks on both left and right muffs, below where they telescope/adjust - but that was over a year ago and they're still solid, so whatever man, easy fix. Maybe they've improved that by now anyway. I'd recommend these especially if you're getting on a plane or something where you want the acoustic privacy and ""sorry I can't hear you"" appearance.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"Really, these sound great and cancel out noise very effectively. But I was looking for something to use at the gym and if you anticipate making any sort of movement in these, don't buy them. I can't run, lift, do sit ups, ANYTHING without them falling off. It's a shame because I really don't mean to bash the product because I didn't read the product description properly.. Just don't want anyone else to run into the same problem",4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"I got these to replace my old blue tooth earbuds. I find earbuds uncomfortable so I started shopping for some headphones. I love these they are comfortable to wear the battery life is awesome! I can charge every other day( I use them pretty much all day). They have an excellent connection I don't have to have my phone in my pocket to keep the connection, which is awesome when I am working around the house or doing yard work. They muffle outside sound which is awesome although not a requirement for me.  I purchased a set of green and I am in love with the color and get compliments from others.",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
"First off, these headphones look amazing. Nice style. Compared to other headphones I've used these stand out a little more. I paid less for these, but the sound quality is so much better. I used them on a two hour flight and they seemed to do well. The crying baby right next to me was not completely cancelled out, but the noise was nulled pretty well. I used the Bluetooth function for about 4 hours and they still had a half-battery lifetime. Now the comfort is a hard one for me because I have bigger ears. I've yet to find a pair of headphones that fit me perfectly, but these are my most comfortable so far. Not too much pressure and my ears didn't sweat like crazy. Anyway, hope this was helpful. Enjoy.",5,1,2017-7-19,1,0,0
I bought these for my 9 year old.  He's gone through so many different headsets over the last 2 years that I finally decided to go wireless because that's usually what he ends up destroying.  He hasn't lost or broken them yet and they keep a charge for a long time.  Haven't tried out the microphone yet since his online tutoring is on break for the summer.  I'll update the review once I know that the microphone works well as well.,4,1,2018-7-23,1,1,0
"Unfortunately, this was not the right product for me.  I was hoping to block out most background noises so that I could read however, I found that they only slightly muffle sounds such as an air conditioner, kids playing, TV, voices. I""m sure they probably work well if you play music, which can be distracting if you're trying to read.",2,1,2020-7-29,1,1,0
"These headphones are well worth the price!!!!!!  I was looking at wireless, over the ear, noise canc headphones for awhile and was thinking Bose or Beats were the best for sound and bass and I was wrong!!!  These are outstanding headphones for the value.  The sound quality is great and the battery life is outstanding.  I have had zero issues with either since buying these.  They sync with no issue at all to my devices, iphone, ipad, apple tv etc....  I haven't even had to use the noise can feature because they block out other sounds so well and the bass is outstanding.UPDATE........  4/4/2018",5,1,2017-10-28,1,0,0
There’s a really bad rattling sound when I run. I bought these so that I can jog but that sound is consistent. I’ve tried to rearrange them but nothing seems to make it stop. I was sent a SECOND pair and they still rattle. Disappointing.,2,1,2020-4-30,1,2,0
"I take these with me when flying.  They do a great  job of reducing the airplane engine hum. I can still hear people talking and other notices in the cabin, but they are greatly reduced. If I am watching a movie or listening to music, it is quite difficult to hear all the cabin noise.  The quality of sound is great for movies. I was thinking I would have to pay a lot more for noise canceling headphones. I’m glad I found these.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
"When powered on, headphones provide excellent sound quality and are very comfortable. Key phrase: When powered on.My one issue, and it is major, is that there is a randomly timed delay from when you switch the headphones on to when they actually turn on. A very small percentage of time it takes about 20-30 seconds, which by itself is weird. More often than not it takes closer to 5-10 minutes which is ridiculous. It got to the point where I would purposely turn the headphones on 20 minutes before I knew I was using them. There is nothing worse than being ready to work out or do some cleaning and then having to wait for my headphones to turn on.",2,1,2020-7-29,1,1,0
"These are simply the best wireless headphones I've had; they've outlived every other set I've had before, and time has not dulled their edge the least. The battery still recharges fast, and lasts about 8 hours (w/o Noise Cancellation, with that, it falls down to 6-7), and the ""Mute the World"" slogan fits like a glove, because I can't have my phone ringing next to me and I won't hear it. Sound quality remains crystal clear, although they sometimes get a bit of noise if there's more than one BT device working on my room. Only thing time has done them is peeling the earmuffs a bit, but I blame that on my acidic sweat than on a quality issue.Rest assured, the day they stop working, I'll be buying them again.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"The packaging, the looks, and comfort are excellent.  The sound quality is very good.  The passive noise canceling is superb, and with music on, you cannot hear any outside conversation.  I tried the ANC with various home appliances like a vacuum cleaner, microwave oven, etc and it reduced the noise to a low hum.Two negatives:",3,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
"Very comfortable and very good sound.  Use them on the plane when I travel mostly.  Work very well.  Also like that you can connect them with an Auxiliary cable as well, which comes in handy on an airplane when you want to watch on the airplane screen on the seatback.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
"I'm not blown away by the sound quality, though the noise cancellation feature seems decent for the price point. My August EP650s are showing their age, so I opted for these E7s since they had a $10 coupon (paid $49). In back to back testing, the August headphones have superior sound, clarity, and bass, so I probably should've just gotten another pair of those even though they don't offer noise cancellation. I have these E7s paired to a OnePlus 6T and find the Bluetooth flutters from time to time...I don't even have this problem with my $20 Soundpeats BT gym headphones.",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
I will say that the headphones are definitely built well. They're very sturdy and I can tell they will last quite a while. Upon use I've noticed the noise cancellation is hardly noticeable it works for maybe very low noises but that's it. In talking to people they can hear you very clear but they can also hear EVERYTHING else out in your surroundings too and it will drown out your voice so you cant use them in a busy area. Only in quiet areas. I also feel the battery dies out really quick as of this moment I cant remember if they last 30hours like a previous one I had but if they do they definitely dont last that long i cant go without charging them for more than 2 or 3 days. But the sound quality for music is nice and the controls on the headset are easy to get used to. Overall it's a good buy I just use my headphones a lot at work and for making calls and wish they muffled out noises better. But I enjoy them. Last thing I will say is annoying is the fact that if you disconnect bluetooth it doesn't turn off automatically you have to physically turn it off,4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I really do like these headphones. I put them on at night when my GF goes to bed so I can watch movies at the volume I want. I have noticed that If I walk around, say to the kitchen to grab a beer, they will sputter a bit, and the audio and video will not be synchronized. You have to turn them off and then back on. Also if the power gets low a voice comes on and says ""Please Charging."" If you can live with those things, these are great headphones.",4,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"Surprisingly good sound quality, but only when paired with my iPhone. For some reason sound quality is poor to mediocre paired with PC, tech support was unable to troubleshoot. I don't have particularly large ears and I found the circular ear cups uncomfortable. Construction is of cheap plastic, the faux leather on the ear cups will eventually peel off, buttons and switches are very cheap feeling, mic quality is very poor. If you need some decent headphones for a smartphone though, these are a good option at $70. Wouldn't pay any more than that though.",3,1,2017-11-18,1,2,0
"Bought these as a teacher so I wouldn't annoy my better half while projecting my voice at my computer.  The built in headset seems to work flawlessly since she said my voice level dramatically decreased.  I noticed an issue of sound cutting out after being in use for about 30-40min.  It would blast this white noise sound.  Made me think battery was dieing.  Contacted customer support and without blinking an eye they sent me a new pair...no questions asked.  My girlfriend uses the new pair and absolutely loves them.  Mine still hits me with the white noise now and again but I simply switch them off and on again....not that big of a deal for me personally.  I would have given 5 if no issues and 3 without the stellar customer service, so 4 it is.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the E7 headphone. I was looking for headphones that would fit a smaller head size and came across these. Aside from being a very good price, they have been well-reviewed and I have to agree. Mind you, the 5-star rating I'm giving is commiserate with the headphones in a similar price range. Don't expect Bose sound out of these but you will not be disappointed with them either.  One thing I do want everyone to know is Cowin's customer service is top-notch!! It would be difficult to find any better! I ran into a small issue when registering the headphones for the extended warranty and it was completely, quickly and pleasantly remedied through their IM support!  5+ stars for Zoey!UPDATE: Difficult to believe but the support and perks through Cowin have gotten even better!

"My son has been asking for Bluetooth headphones for months & he settled on these. He uses them daily while working on his homework, chores, etc. I've also used them to listen to audio books while doing yard work - they fit comfortably, do a decent job of cancelling outside noises & have great sound quality. The noise cancelling quality isn't the best, however it's enough that they would not be safe to use while bicycling, skateboarding, etc. Overall, he is very pleased with the purchase & will likely purchase them again once he wears them out.",4,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
"I must have spent 2 full days looking at reviews. I finally went with their pair because of a review a sound engineer posted. Headphones came packed nicely. The do seem to have a nice quality to them. I was a little annoyed with the quality of the buttons on the headset. They aren't the best quality.  I must say these headpnes are more comfortable than my Sennheiser RS-180 wireless one. But the biggest surprise is the sound quality.  First of all these headphones canceled out almost all the background noise. The sound is full and rich. Not to much bass just right. I'm really happy with these headphones. You cat beat the sound quality for the price, in my opinion. I would recommend these",4,1,2017-12-12,1,0,0
"Very unimpressed. I got these for my father who is hard of hearing. He couldn't turn the sound up high enough for him to be able to understand the TV. When I use them they muddy sound.

I would not recommend these for anything.",3,1,2019-9-27,1,1,0
"I needed to get some noise-canceling headphones since being in quarantine (I have two little ones and couldn't focus on work because they are loud and obnoxious...LOL) and I found these on Amazon. They do everything that I need them to do. They are also good for phone calls too. They have very good battery life. I don't use the 'noise cancel' setting often as these isolate the sound good enough for me. It's only when things get a little too crazy that I need to switch that on. Overall, I'm very satisfied with these!!!",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
After years of buying ceapy headphones from the dollar store I broke down and went looking for a decent pair. I pinch my pennies and on top of that have hearing issues making headphones almost impossible. After getting these it took a bit for me to connect the blue tooth.

After reading the reviews I was expecting much more.I was disappointed with the volume of the headphones (Didn't get very loud) and the noise cancelling function was almost non-existent.

I recently started having issues with these headphones. They no longer connect to my laptop via Bluetooth and that was all I used them for while I studied. Now they sit on my shelf collecting dust. Also shortly before they stopped working the audio changed and everything sounded farther away for some reason.,2,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0
"If you are using these for sound, they are okay (keep in mind these are sub 100)  They connect to my MAC easy enough the sound is great, but when i try to use them for zoom meetings, the MIC will just drop and stop working.  The noise cancelling feature when enabled just emits series of clicks odd noises.They are comfortable if a bit heavy, and will work adequately for personal use paired with my phone or tablet.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
Very comfortable. I have been using these during the day to be courteous to my wife while she is working from home. They have amazing battery life. I really did not perceive a noise cancellation. It simply lowers the volume so I don’t use it. I bought these to use while riding my lawnmower so I won’t have to have my volume so high. I have used these with the vacuum cleaner and was disappointed at how much I could still hear the vacuum ☹️,4,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I bought these for gym use, noise canceling is amazing. Build is decent quality, could be the material, it feels a bit fragile for me but that's my problem. Sound isn't as loud as id like compared to some I've had before, but that could be a good thing since you wont feel that light headed feeling some do when music is too loud for too long. Bluetooth connection is quick and simple. Overall the owner put some good thought put into the build and it works fine.",4,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0
"Updated:  customer service reached out and offered the updated headphones for no extra cost.  Once I  recieved them I noticed the plastic part that had snapped in the prior pair had been moved up making them much more durable.  Great customer service, I honestly was suprised that after almost a year they reached out to me to make this right.  Headphones have great sound and noise canceling!Thank you.",4,1,2019-6-2,1,1,0
"Fantastic wireless headphones, especially for the price! Sounds good, battery life is incredible, and they actually for my gigantic head when adjusted the whole way out. I wear a 64cm motorcycle helmet, and these headphones fit me. Bluetooth range is pretty amazing too, my laptop stays linked and unbroken when I walk to the kitchen 2 rooms away. Noise cancellation isn't perfect, but incredible for 60 bucks. Dramatic reduction in outside noise. I'd definitely buy again, thinking about buying a 2nd pair for work. Build quality is good, they've got alot of plastic of course, but seem built pretty solidly.",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Piece of junk. They do not work. I’ve been charging them for hours and they will not turn on/connect. The light keeps showing that they are charging. Nothing has changed and they have been plugged in for hours. I have tried different outlets, cords, and charging blocks and nothing.",1,1,2019-5-30,1,2,0
These headphones will unpair at least 2 to 3 times a day. They are within a few feet of the computer. I will be replacing them. They are not worth the price. After I submitted this review Cowin customer service contacted me and gave me a full refund. So I do have to say that they do support their product. This is refreshing in This day and age. So if you are having issues with their products contact them. I am increasing my overall rating due to their support.,4,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"Nice for the money..very comfortable and they sound good. As with many products today, it would be a lot to ask for the instruction booklet to be ever so slightly more comprehensive, but it’s not the saddest I’ve seen. At least there is one.The controls are a bit perplexing. Up is down and down is up. ..",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Update: exchanged for a second pair to see if the low volume was a fluke, since the sound was otherwise nice. Nope. those are going back as well. That it for Cowin from here. These are WAYYYY too quiet. The sound that we could hear was good, but too low to be usable. It's a shame, because the noise isolation and comfort were off the charts! But that doesn't do much good if they don't put out enough volume to be used. Too bad. I got these for my son and was so pumped by the reviews that I almost ordered the pro version. Glad I didnt. These are useless. What a let down. We are returning these.",1,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I thought these were fine for awhile. I've had them several months but the left speaker stopped working after I laid in bed with them. Looking at the swivel area, I noticed that the wire was taunt. Because the microphone is on the left side, that also stopped working. Better to get a headset with some play in the wires that is more durable.",2,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"Great for traveling, use these mostly on flights and it cuts down well on the low engine sounds. Higher pitched sounds not much better than non-cancelling headphones, but a nice thing to have on flights. Durability seems to be good as well, as we placed them in back packs when not in use. That said we also purchased the Pro version, imho it is a better value as the sound cancelling is a little better, and they come with a hard carrying case, vs a bag this one comes with.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"Dollars to donuts, these are some excellent ear donuts for the price point. They are comfortable, sufficiently effective at lowering outside noise with great sound. I can attest to the fact however, that they cannot overcome all of the noise of a household which is made of 5 boys, two dogs, and a cat. But to be 100% honest...apart from a sensory deprivation chamber, not much can overcome that amount of noise. With that said, these do a fantastic job at lower the amount of noise in such circumstances. The battery life is phenomenal, have had since Christmas 2019 and only changed them once, just because. They are simple to use and set up and I've considered buying a second pair, so I don't have to share. The added ability to use an aux cord is also a nice perk since my laptop's blue-tooth interface is rubbish, no fear, aux cord is here. Over all, these noise cancelling head phones are worth it, I'd buy them again, and suggest them to anyone even considering buy headphones.",4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I've really been impressed with these. I have a pair of Bose over-ear headphones that I use at work, but wanted a cheaper pair of noise cancelling headphones to use at home when the neighbors get too noisy. These are fantastic. Awesome battery life, comfortable to wear, and the noise cancelling is way better than I was expecting for $60. Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
"These are easily the best headphones I've ever had. In terms of battery life, nothing compares. I charged them fully for the first time two days ago and I have been using them about 7 hours every day while still having more than 70% battery remaining, according to my iPad. In short, the battery life on these is exceptional. The comfort of these headphones is also beyond expression. I have larger-than-average ears, but that hasn't made these uncomfortable at all. I usually take them off around once every hour for a few minutes, but I can honestly say that you don't really feel them while you listen to music. Speaking of music, the sound quality of these is excellent. I wasn't shopping for high-end headphones, but the sound from these honestly rivals some of the lower-end expensive headphones I've tried. The noise-cancellation is very high-quality. I have even missed my own name being called while wearing these! There are only three things I don't like about these headphones. For one thing, the controls on the side seem to be upside-down. I feel like the skip track/increase volume button should be on top, but it ended on the bottom, but it  doesn't take much to get used to it. Aside from that, the swiveling ear cups swivel toward the wearer. My old headphones swiveled away and that made it easy to place them down on the ear pads. Finally, the cord extends from the right ear cup even though the headphone port on most computers lies on the left of the machine. 9/10 would buy again.",4,1,2017-10-10,1,1,0
"These are decent headphones, but nothing to write home about. The sound quality is not as clear as it could be, and I dislike that they don't charge while they are plugged in. (You have to plug them in separately via USB.Also, the main reason I bought these was to block out background noise at work. The noise-cancelling feature does essentially nothing (there is a slight muffling of background noise - not much). All in all, definitely not worth the price and I would not recommend.",2,1,2019-1-9,1,1,0
"So, I bought these headphones about a month and a half ago and I love them.  The battery life is amazing.  I use my headphones 4-5 hours a day and can go 2-3 days without charging them which is is extremely convenient.  The noise canceling is great as well.  I don’t hear any outside noise while listening to music or watching movies from my phone.  The noise canceling, paired with great clear sound quality is exactly what I was looking for.  I definitely enjoy these and will continue to use them",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"Just bought these for a 6 hour flight. I am blown away at the quality for the cost. My wife has Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, so I am using them as a benchmark. Although the noise cancelling feature does not work as well as the Bose, the Cowins are not far behind. The sound quality is great and the battery life is phenomenal. I charged them the night before the trip, used them at the airport, during the flight, at the airport heading home and on the return flight and never had to worry about them dying. They are also very comfortable.",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"These headphones saved my sanity! My upstairs neighbour plays an electric guitar and I also hear the laundry and dryer machines from downstairs/ I was going mad until I bought these headphones; they completely cancel all ambient noise!!!They sound good too; in fact, I started watching TV with them on! The sound is absolutely great. I could not be  happier I bought them.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"I am beyond impressed with these headphones.  The sound quality is really full and clear, and it’s nice for me to finally have a headset that is cordless.  Once charged it lasts for 30 hours.  These are truly noise canceling, And they go over the ear so I can tune out the world and it is a treat.  I’ve used these every day since I bought them 2 months ago, so I’ve had some time to really use them before writing a review.  I do recommend these!",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"There is no button for mute on the headset.  I have to turn them off and on over and over again to get them to connect to my 2019 16"" MacBook Pro.  They're useless.  I am going to stop using them as soon as I can find another pair to order.  I had a pair of Creatives that worked great, took a chance on these for the noise cancellation.",2,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0
"This is my first review ever, just felt the need to leave an opinion on these, they are durable, fit great, comfortable on your ears and head, I use them on my zero turn mower and weed eating, I bought these figuring they would cancel out more noise so could listen to music and not so much the mower, I use to use ear buds and they were okay but not enough sound over the mower. That’s where I’m disappointed, I was excited to receive these and they are great besides the fact they just aren’t loud enough for the money, the price is a little excessive for them not being very loud (I’m only 27, have great hearing) if they were a little louder and cancelled out a little more noise they’d get 5 stars from me, just shop around a little more if your planning on using these in a very noisy setting they just don’t quite get the job done.",3,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I got these on Friday with the intent that I could use them at work in my open concept office.  I freely admit to being easily distracted. My other over the ear headphones were corded and just didn't have the reach I need to do my job comfortably without having to constantly take them off.  I went online to find a blue tooth/wireless set that would allow me to move around my desk area while staying connected--these have the added noise cancelling feature.  First day back at work (I was using them all weekend and loved them) and so far they are doing exactly what I needed them to do. For this price, I am very impressed with the overall quality and feel of these headphones.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a quality set to wear around the office and keep yourself focused.",5,1,2018-7-16,1,1,0
"I never write reviews. I typically am happy with the products I order from Amazon. But this is beginning to look like a ripoff because I paid a significant amount of money and the product does not work as advertised. I work in the tech industry and, especially in this age, am reliant on remote meetings working correctly. I have had issue with these headphones being detected by the software multiple times! On top of it, for some stupid reason, there are two modes of operation where one is where the audio is bad and what you say into the microphone is heard well, and the other where the audio is horrific and what you say into the microphone is heard well. BUT THE WORST PART of it is abruptly out of nowhere, my laptop no longer detects the E7 Cowin device so I can't even use the wireless functionality anymore.To make a long story short, don't waste your time on some random Chinese product that will break down on you in the most critical times when you're presenting analysis that will make or break your organization. Don't make the mistake I made, and pay for something more reliable.",1,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I love my new headphones. They cover my ears completely, are adjustable and the springiness of the headphones has been tuned perfectly to make them comfortable. I usually wear them for several hours at a time without discomfort. The battery life is also really good, I find myself having to recharge them about once a week (using the USB cable, included with the product) despite extensive use. The sound quality is great, bass sounds are good and the volume can be turned up to very loud levels if necessary. The noise cancellation feature also works well, even though I often do not turn it on when listening to music or podcasts as sounds are more natural this way. The only negative aspect of this product might be the quality of the mic, I usually do not use these headphones for my online meetings. But overall it is a great product, especially for the price.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I think I really would have enjoyed these headphones, if not for a few missing crucial features.For one, it doesn't come with a hard case. It comes with a faux leather drawstring bag that I couldn't get to close all the way. I'm a college student and I want to be sure that my headphones won't get battered up when I put them in my backpack. I know this is partially my fault for not looking at the product close enough, but I would expect headphones like these to have a case for protection when traveling.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"These headphones admittedly are not the best on the market, but for their price point, they are absolutely fantastic. Here's why.The over-ear feel to these is absolutely perfect. It's soft and comfortably fits even over my enormous head. Because the speakers themselves flex so smoothly, these are able to fit anyone's head perfectly. I wore them around my school campus for several hours and they barely made me sweat, unlike a lot of headphones of similar size, weight, and padding.",5,1,2017-8-3,1,1,0
"I bought these as a birthday present and the reviews were extremely high, only to receive them and get a whole different experience. When I connect the cord to my phone and headphones, there is no sound coming out of the headphones and yes they are turned on. I've tried several times and different phones, all with the same result. Then after taking the cord out, I had issues with connecting to Bluetooth. So I've returned them. Too much of a hassle when it should be simple.",2,1,2020-2-29,1,1,0
"After a week of use with my Cowin E7 blue tooth headphones I can say I'm very happy with my purchase. Paring with my Galaxy S9+ was easy, and the controls on the headphones work well. I had to make some equalizer adjustments on my phone to get the sound where I wanted it; after doing so these headphones are great. This is not my first Cowin product I have an MP3 player that's at least 10 years old and it also works very well.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
"Disclaimer.  I have only owned these headsets for a week or so.  But, I love the fit over my ears and the adjustments available.  The connection of the phones to the head band seems quite sturdy and not likely to break easily.  This is important since my old set of another brand broke.  It was plastic, not metal.  The sound is good and the controls all work perfectly.  The blue tooth set up was easy and fast.  Great not having a cord to deal with.  Although the cord does work well for a non-blue tooth Walkman.  Further review after I use them more.",5,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0
"They beep whenever you receive a notification on your iPhone or initiate any action on your iPhone. Noise canceling is ok but nowhere near the Beats in ears that I already had.

"A wonderful product. Great sound, good noise cancellation, but not to the point that i'm totally sonically isolated from my environment. Much like being plugged into the stereo as a kid.  I used it for about two weeks, then found it was too small for my large, flat ears, and hurt physically to wear for more than about 30 minutes.

After 15 months of using and recharging my Cowin E7 Headphones they stopped charging. Spoke with Alina in services and was informed they were still under the 18 month warranty. Another set was delivered to my door step shortly after. I like the sound quality and the comfortable over the ear fit. I use my headset for working on the golf course. I do a lot of mowing and other jobs that require ear protection and the noise cancelling feature really works. I can also receive phone calls. What I don't like is when the low battery warning beeps you only have about five minutes left before they turn off. This has happened a hour after I started working. No noise cancelling or Bluetooth. I carry a backup set of Bluetooth Ear buds when this happens.,5,1,2018-8-8,1,0,0
"I was skeptic because of some of the other reviews, but I've had my pair for 2 months now and have zero problems. Bluetooth is super easy to setup up, the directions that come with the headphones basically walk you through everything. They come in a nice sturdy box that keeps them safe, and the battery life is amazing! I could use them for 2-4 days on full charge. They also have a pretty decent range on how far away you can get from the device they're connected to. The only reason this review is 4 stars and not 5 is because in the beginning the Bluetooth setting were a bit confusing, seeing there's both ""Headphones"" and ""Headset"" mode.",4,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0

The piece of cheap junk that arrived in the ""gift box"" should have just been filled with horse apples, at least I wouldn't have wasted any further time. Nothing about this set works right. I'm not sure if I got a bad set from the factory, but I don't even want to mail them back for a new pair. I'm just exhausted with trying to manipulate and watch Youtube videos with trying to get these damn things to do anything. I don't want anything else to do with anything these people ""manufacture.""

For noise canceling I can still hear people talking to me, but when the office folk are chattering about nothing I'm able to just hear it as background noise or I'll turn on music. I'm sure Bose would be better but consider the difference in price and these are WINNERS.",4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

"The Cowin E-7 is a beautifully crafted, very comfortable, noise cancelling headphone and the sound quality everything I had hoped for. It paired up quickly with my HP Laptop on the first attempt without any hesitation. The fit and finish is near perfect in my opinion. The attractive brushed aluminum frame is very attractive, well padded and oh so smooth to the touch. It came with a nice leather like travel bag, a cord for direct connection to a cell phone, laptop or other similar device and a USB cable for charging the lithium battery. After performing a good long over night first-time battery charge, I used them for six continuous hours glorious comfortable hours. There was no fading of sound and the battery seemed to be ready for several more hours of use. The volume control is smooth and adjusts easily.

"When I first got these headphones, I loved them.  I got them so that I could block out outside noises and study.  They worked perfectly, they fit well, and I was happy.  I logged onto the company's company, and registered them. I used them very lightly, never dropped them and kept them safe and dry.  Then, all of the sudden (while I was wearing them), the sound quality just dropped.  It sounds like everything is underwater.  After multiple attempts to reach out to Cowin, and having heard nothing back, I am giving up.  And, surprise, when I went to log in to view my product registration, it was gone.  I just feel like headphones should last longer than a year and three months- especially with light use. :(",1,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I have seen so many great reviews about these headphones and others by the same brand. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in these. The volume and sound quality are very poor. It’s not a clear strong sound but low and a bit muffled - definitely poor base quality. I’m really surprised because they have great reviews and these are not cheap. I actually found that my cheaper $20 ones had better quality which really surprised me.",1,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"LOVE THEM👍 They're easy to connect to, the battery is about 24-28hr range on battery life and it depends on if you run them at full volume the entire time. They are probably the loudest bluetooth headphones I have ever had. Plus, they come with a auxiliary connection so they are a little louder and I believe they will do it without being card on the aux. The sounds dampening is good but I have a hard time believing they do 28dbs. Over all a good buy for the money.Edit: bought them in June and they lasted till a few weeks ago and its November 20th, 2019. They just won't charge or turn on. But I do work in the dust and dirt everyday so they got beat up. So if you are using them at home they should last a long time.",5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
Bought these thinking price point was great to replace my old $300 Bose.  I found other folks are right - when the plane lands the sound skips.  Also the ear pads are a round circle.

"The wife and I have the Sony noise canceling headphones, and even though these aren't even remotely close to them in performance and quality, they are perfect for our 11 year old daughter.  We didn't want to spend sony money on headphones for a kid that will most likely loose or break them.  So we decided on these, and for the price I was pleasantly surprised by how good they work.  Very stylish and they work as advertised.  Win win for us, and my daughter loves them.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"For the price, these headphones aren't bad. The noise cancellation is excellent, they look sleek and smart, and they are comfortable. Unfortunately, their max volume is incredibly lacking. It's odd to me because the noise cancellation is great but these do NOT get very loud, even at max volume on my phone and the headphones. Additionally, they don't fit all the way in the case provided (which isn't a huge deal but seems like a silly oversight to me), leaving the top portion of the headphones constantly exposed. If these had more oomph to them, I'd be a happy camper. So unfortunately, I wouldn't really recommend these unless you don't need your headphones to have a decent volume range.",3,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
"Headphones came nicely  packaged in a sturdy box which you could use to store them if you wanted. They are padded well and are comfortable on the ears.

"The Cowin E7's appearance is sleek and very well engineered. The sound quality is excellent especially coupled with the noise cancellation. As far as the battery life goes I fully charged the headset when I received it and have used it for almost a week now without having to recharge. Admittedly, I only use the headset several hours a day. The battery is one of the great features because it can be replaced by the user. I find the head set is very comfortable for the periods that I wear it. he soft gel ear cups also provide passive noise reduction if you do not want to engage the active noise reduction feature. The headset has a light that will indicate if the unit needs to be charged.",5,1,2017-1-17,1,1,0
"I’m sure that a pair of Bose would provide much better sound quality and noise cancellation, but I am very happy with these for their value. I push mowed my 0.35 acre yard at least once a week all spring and summer while sweating in the humid south. They’ve held their charge and allowed me to enjoy my music collection and Prime streaming music without the hassle of a cord. The do slide if I have to bend over, but it’s not a major annoyance.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I have tried a lot of bluetooth headphone under $70, they all hand some kind of problem, be it a high pitch noise with the ANC on, or just no bass to speak of, than I got this Cowin E7's, Oh my gosh, this things sound great! I love hip hop, rap and hard rock, all of that sounds amazing on these. To me the sound is better in BT and not ANC. As far as ANC goes, I can hear everything with that mode on, without the music, and with music, it makes the sound muffled imo. All in all a great set of BT headphones. I will be buying from Cowin again!",5,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0
"I like the noise cancelling feature. I like the way that they fit. They are easy to use. I bought the red ones because I have a kid who likes red. Did it for him because sometimes when there is a show on that I don't want to watch and my wife or kid does, sometime I just put on the headphones without any sound on them.I think they are comfortable and the pairing was incredibly easy both with my phone and my other devices and I have and I phone 8 plus.",5,1,2018-9-19,1,0,0
"Besides comfort, there is little remarkable about these headphones. Plugged in, the sound quality is decent, though not remarkable. On Bluetooth/wireless, the sound quality drops dramatically, to the point that they are not worth using in this mode. To be honest this wouldn't be a deal ender at the price point. The real problem is that the mic cannot be used in the plugged in mode. You must be on Bluetooth. So if you are looking at using these as any sort of communication headphones, stay away.",2,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0
"We love both of the headphone sets! My wife has had no problems with hers. She uses it a lot for listening to YouTube music, movies and news. She loves the sound and says it seems easy to connect. I love mine also . . . now. At first, I was getting a lot of interference and cutting out. Then I realized that my Bluetooth mouse was fighting with it. I turned the mouse off and everything is fine. Good sound for music, movies and news. We haven't tried the noise canceling feature yet. I guess we just haven't needed it. Phil ~",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"bot E7 for blue tooth feature but set did not pair with two of my devices. furthermore the wired port did not work either. Beautiful set, comfortable but have no idea of sound quality as it didnt work! very disappointed. Then an Amazon rep promised to send me an upgrade set but failed to follow through...double disappointment. I do not recommend E7 headset.",1,1,2019-4-5,1,2,0
"Whenever I try to use these for a phone call. The person I'm on the call with cannot hear me well at all. Whoever designed the 3-way triangle button on the side must have a learning disability. The volume up is on the bottom and the volume down on the top. These guys couldn't even scrape the cash together to get good localization. The low battery audio message is ""Plug in to charging"". Yeah that sounds right... I thought these would be a good brand with all the positive reviews. But it's just another Chinese knock off brand. Unless you can pick these up for $15-$20, stay away.",2,1,2020-7-15,1,1,0
"Purchased these to replace 2+ year old headphones that I left at a hotel during travel. I purchased these based on other reviews. I tend to get headaches if the fit is too tight, the fit on these headphones was great. Way more comfortable than my last pair. The noise cancelling is pretty good while flying, not top quality by any means but good for the cost of these headphones. I would recommend these and will purchase again.",4,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Bluetooth reset does not work. I’ve followed the direction manual multiple times on multiple occasions. Someone else has connected to my headphones and I cannot kick them off. Makes them completely unusable. Even with an aux to lightning cable it will not come through.UPDATE: I was contacted by the seller regarding my issue with the headphones. She was very quick to send out a new pair. Although it took a while, all is well that ends well! Thank you to the care team at Cowin!",5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"I was stoked to get these in the mail today. I charged them up, paired to my iPhone, put on one of my favorite songs to test the sound and was completely bummed out. Low volume, overly bassy (that’s a word). It was underwhelming.But now they are AWESOME!!! Why?",5,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0

Earbuds don't work for me - they constantly fall out and are very uncomfortable.  These earphones are comfortable!  The sound is decent.  I am taking them to Europe and will use them to listen to self-guided tours of museums and am hopeful that the noise reduction feature works well enough on airplanes that I can sleep.  They were not so expensive that it will. ruin the trip if they break or I forget them someplace.,5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
These are very nice head phones.  They sound great!  The noise cancelling is not that impressive but the over all quality and the quality of sound have me sold.  I own a Bose NC and these do not compare but there is a huge price difference.  I bought these to travel out of the country with to reduce the possibility of my Bose getting ruined or stolen.  I am going to purchase again for a gift and one for myself too.,4,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"What can I say about this product? Bar none, for the price the BEST value out there. Compares well to MUCH higher end products, and the Active Noise Cancelling feature works surprisingly well. GREAT sound quality, great bass response and clarity. The feature buttons on the side are multifunctional and easy to access. Build quality is amazing for the price point and feels much like the ""higher end"" products. The ear cups are soft and create a complete seal, which makes the ANC feature work very well.I bought these for my daughter. But, I liked the so much, i bought myself another pair. I'm so impressed that I am buying the ANC earbuds, AND the Soundbar.",5,1,2018-3-13,1,0,0
"These headphones have been awesome. They are super comfortable on my ears, and the charge legitimately lasts for days. I have also been really happy with the sound quality. The noise cancellation feature is a little less effective than I had hoped, but it is still helpful at ""muffling"" the noise around you. The only really negative thing I have to say is that I use these for both my phone and my laptop, but the headphones will only recognize the last device I used, so I have to re-pair the bluetooth every time I switch from one device to the other. Maybe this wouldn't be a problem if the devices weren't in close proximity to each other, but I'm not sure. Anyway, it's a little annoying. Overall, though, these are excellent headphones, and I would definitely recommend them.",4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I'm a medical transcriptionist so literally all I do is listen to audio all day long.  These have very clear, crisp vocal audio.  But there is a bit of a background hum that I'm not particularly fond of.  I have multiple different audio systems running and adjusted them all down, but still the hum remains.  It isn't bad when the audio is playing, but when I'm waiting for the next audio to load, it can get a little annoying.But regarding the noise cancelling feature, it is AMAZING!!!  I don't know how I ever worked without it all these years to be honest.  It's perfect when you have kids and trying to work in the same room.",4,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0
"I have had these for all of one day so this review is likely to be updated. So far the quality of sound is nice and fit rather comfortably if I'm not wearing earrings.One major thing I have noticed, the right ear cuff vibrates randomly and its mildly annoying. The vibration stops pretty quickly but it consistent so far.",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
Bought these for my dad for Father’s Day and he’s in love with them. He has 4 grand daughters and 2 daughters and my mom at the house and now he can’t hear any of this. We have to scream for him to hear us. He does have bad hearing but these are awesome and comfy!,5,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
"These are my first noise cancelling headphones. They are awesome! On the NC setting if you lean into the ear pieces it kinda messes with the sound I noticed but it wasn't really an issue.I wore these the entire flights back from Sweden to NY and my ears/head did not hurt. My friend also bought new headphones for our trip and I tried them, not as comfortable, they were oblong while these are round ear pieces and very cushy. The battery, quality, and comfort are great. I am not a fan of the volume and track control buttons on the right ear piece, but I really don't care that much. Totally worth it.",5,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0
"This is a great product!  Sound quality is awesome, battery is awesome, the product feel on my head/ears is very comfortable, sound quality of voice calls is great, mic for voice calls (based on what people on the far side of calls have said) is perhaps a little hollow but clear.  The noise cancelling is maybe a little weak, however, you shouldn’t expect the same cancelling quality as a $400 set of Sony or Bose at this amazing price.  Engine noise from cars and planes are either eliminated or reduced to a soft hum with this product.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat!",5,1,2019-10-10,1,1,0
"They broke on both sides (left side worse) where the ear cups rotate on the headband after 6 to 7 months. They won't stay on head now. Cowin replaced them as they were under warranty. There was no neglect by user. We spent more money in hopes of a pair of headphones with good sound and that would last a couple of years. Hopefully this new pair will last longer. Thank you for honoring the warranty. The noise cancelling was great, the sound quality was great.",4,1,2020-3-10,1,0,1
"I've been using this headphones for over a year (heading into two years), and it has never failed me. Excellent quality sound, very comfortable headphones, and even after so long and suffering the abuse of being roughly stuffed into my packed backpack, it's still going strong. I love how when you run out of battery or the device you want to connect to has no bluetooth, you still have the option of using a lined audio connection as well. Definitely would recommend.",5,1,2018-12-22,1,1,0
"When it's ""direct"" connected to the device with the wire provided, it works great. The BT has major issues connecting to different devices, the operation is erratic and the op manual is hard to follow and incomplete.

The sound is great which was a surprise to me I wasn't sure they'd stand up to my last pair but they do, decent range and good bass as is (not fantastic but good) and they handle an EQ bass boost well.",4,1,2018-8-12,1,0,0
"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my adult daughter.  Mine work perfectly but hers does not work in the wireless mode.  There is a constant beeping and the instructions recommended she open the battery case to take out the battery and put it back in to reset it.  The instructions say the battery is removable but she could not get the case to open.  She watched several youtube videos on these headphones and all say how easy it is to remove the battery case.  It is not and my husband also was unable to get it to open.  She stopped trying after a small crack appeared in the case and she emailed the company but did not receive a reply.  She can use them only with the audio wire and cannot use the Bluetooth function.  I gave this 3 stars because only one of the headphones we received worked.  I'm afraid if I have to replace the lithium battery that the case on my headphones won't open either.",3,1,2017-8-5,1,0,0
Headphones sound great with very effective noise calculation function.  The battery life is very good and the headphones easily adjust for a comfortable fit.

"Great quality for the price.  Yes, the Bose are better at noise cancelling, but I prefer the price on these.  I can hear some noise like my kids yelling ""mom"", but they tune out background noise like the washing machine and A/C really well.  Two of my family members don't like how the noise cancelling option feels on their ears... The frequency or whatever it is.  I don't mind it at all.  The Bluetooth has a good range.",4,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
These headphone Are great because they connect to my phone very seamlessly. The first few months of using them were important because they really proved themselves on my commute.I have a lot of anxiety and these helped abate a lot of it on my commute through nyc subways.

"For 60$, I was expecting much better sound quality. These apple earphones that came with my phone have a much stronger bass and overall sound quality than these headphones. The second I tried these headphones out I immediately thought that there must be some sort of bass or sound control, but there isn't. For Headphones with ""Deep Bass"", this is definitely not what I was looking for. They do seem like they will last a long time, and look nice, but that makes the case worse considering I do not want to keep something that doesn't sound good. Looks like I will have to save up my money again and get some really expensive headphones if this is what 60$ gets you.",2,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0
***Updated Review***10/16/18After a couple of weeks testing out my new Cowin E7 pro headphones I must say they sound pretty good. The first pair were definitely defective. These sound much better. Good bass and not muffled. Last quite awhile on a charge. As far as noise canceling I would call it mediocre. Not too good but not too bad. Bluetooth range seems pretty good. My only knock is that when you would like to switch between Bluetooth to hardwired the headphones need to be powered via usb in order to work. I take a star away for that but Bluetooth works great and they sound damn good otherwise. Hope this helps in your headphone decision making.,4,1,2018-9-14,1,0,0
"I like to use my tablet to listen to music or podcasts and to watch Hulu. I always used headphones with a cord because I thought the sound quality would suffer with a Bluetooth headset. I got an inexpensive Bluetooth headset and it was ok, but flimsy. So I decided to upgrade. The Cowin E7 seemed to be highly rated for the price on Amazon. I can see why! I am very happy with them. The sound quality is excellent and I have quite a range with them. Shipping was easy and quick. Signing up for the extended warranty was simple.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"These are my FAVORITE bluetooth headphones EVER. They're easy to set up right out of the box. I have these connected to my computer and the bluetooth works so well, that I can walk around anywhere in the house to listen to the music from my computer. It's made out of plastic, but the quality of it seems pretty good.Pros:",4,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0
"The headphones came very well packaged and appeared to be manufactured by a company that cares about their quality. The instructions were clear and concise. Charging, pairing and fitting the headphones was fast and easy. The ear cups are soft and comfortable, plus they do an excellent job of blocking out noise before the noise cancelling feature is even turned on. The controls only took a moment to learn and are simple, yet unobtrusive. Battery life is excellent.Two things to note: when you need the noise level to go from “loud” to “quiet” in a noisy environment (like a noisy outdoor area of a university campus) these headphones do the trick nicely. What impressed me even more is that when I used them in the university library’s study area, things like whispers, muffled coughs and squeaking tables were silenced. Completely silenced. Additionally, the value is phenomenal when you consider the quality of both the sound and the noise cancelling. This is the best pair of headphones I’ve ever purchased.",5,1,2019-3-16,1,0,0
"Although the power switch is very small, the ""on"" and ""off"" position indication direction printed on the earpiece is nearly impossible to see. My elderly wife cannot tell if the headphones are on or off. She has to look at the power on light on the opposite earpiece. Overall the headphones are comfortable as she falls asleep with them on. Bluetooth operation is seamless but there should be some indication of connectivity such as a light.",3,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"Where are all these great reviews coming from? The noise cancelling is annoying at best and mostly uncomfortable. Mutes about 10% ambient noise.The mic is absolute garbage. I tried using the headsets on a Bluetooth call and the other end complained of poor sound quality with too much background noise, the kind you'd expect with cheap $5 earphones.",2,1,2019-9-14,1,2,0
"I purchased these as noise cancelling headphones for travelling and they made a huge difference decreasing the general exhaustion that comes with the background hum of the planes, trains, airports, etc. I even ended up sleeping with them on a noisy metropolitan apartment a couple of nights to tune out the city noise. The sound quality was great for music and watching movies on the plane/train, and the blue tooth link up was easy to get working. The cups were gentle enough that they did not hurt my ears even about 9+ hours and the band did not pull my hair as I moved around. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase, especially this this price point.I do wish they were slightly less bulky when stored.",5,1,2017-11-5,1,0,0
This is a good product. this is my first and only (so far) noise cancelling headphones I purchased. Everything works with the headset. My windows 7 computer connected to it fine. the noise cancelling is a little weird and give me a headache after awhile. sounds like the noise cancelling mode admits a very soft ...white noise that cancels out most background noise. (almost feels like a pressure change in the headphones)Im sure the noise cancelling is work fine i'm just not use to it yet.,4,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"This was a Christmas gift from my husband and I love them. I use them to workout and clean around the house. On average I use them about 2 hours a day. I dont find that I have to charge them that often, maybe about once a week if I'm slacking. But I've never had the battery get low or die on me. They are very noise cancelling to where I have to be sure I'm not hearing my kids crying ;). Also, they were definitely on the higher end of professional packaging",5,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0
It came on time & also looks better in person!! Sound was great! Quality of the speakers worked great & they look expensive which is always a plus! And i loved that the came with a little leather pouch to keep them in! I wasnt expecting that! Def recommend this product!,5,1,2019-1-22,1,2,0
Love these!! I originally bought these so I could listen to podcasts as I migrate around my workshop without having to blast a radio to near deafening levels so I can hear it over my machines. I’ve since started using them to keep me entertained while I’m on my cab-less tractor mowing. It’s the perfect balance of noise canceling (so I can still hear the machine or tractor I’m working with) while still being able to hear the podcast or music with the volume at a normal level.,5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"I love-love these headphones! They are extremely comfortable even with extended wear. The noise cancelling works great enough to drown out the loud kids when I want to sit outside and get zen. Sound is super and the battery life is impressive. In the rare event you do run down the battery, you can use the provided cable to listen wired until you get a chance to recharge. I use them literally every day was so happy with them I bought some for my daughter as well. COWIN's customer service is stellar and they stand behind their stuff. I had a problem with a pair I bought over a year ago and they agreed to replace it immediately. Cannot go wrong with these!",5,1,2017-12-10,1,0,0
"I spent almost my entire day using my new Cowin E7 headphones. Everything looked great and the connectivity with my phone was no issue. However, i felt like when i went for a long walk with my headphones there was several times when the music missed a beat almost as if the walking movement was interrupting the connectivity. This is first time i have seen this effect in any bluetooth headphones that i have used.. also, seems like lifetime of product is only around 2-3 months... i charge everyday and as if end of august, the headphones switch on only occasionally and doesnot hold charge",4,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"I have purchased these headphones for myself and two other members of my family. I must say that they seem luxurious for the price - the metal pieces make them feel substantial and heavy. These would be great for use in an office setting.  (I would not recommend these for running or working out - you would want a lighter weight, plastic headband that would stay in place.)We love the noise cancellation feature. The battery life is good. I am not a good judge of sound quality, but I have no complaints.",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"Great headphones for the price offered. Wanted to get noise cancelling headphones ever since my friend bought some Bose ones but I thought they were way too expensive. I ordered these and compared both of them:- Bose headphones had better audio quality, the noise canceling function was better, and they cupped around my ears a lot better than these (may be due to my large ears). The switch on the side that lets you turn it on, off, and turn on the noise canceling function is a bit tricky and I found myself accidentally turning off my headphones whenever I wanted to switch the noise canceling off.",5,1,2018-3-4,1,0,0
"I use these headphones to listen to my music while I am in my workshop using extremely loud tools such as my thickness planer and router,  these headphones give me fantastic sound and last well over a day,  The sound quality is fantastic,  they are an extremely comfortable fit and after a while I even forget that I have them on,  I like that the volume and pause buttons are easily accessable on the right hand side.  The headphones look good too LOL",5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0

I tend to be clumsy and it fell a few times, but a bit of it broke (nothing major though) only recently, but the quality of the headphones is still the same, so it’s very sturdy! I live in NYC so before Covid I used to take it with me every day on the subway and basically anywhere I went. It’s really a game changer! It helps me to keep focused on my daily tasks. The only thing that I thought could be better is the shape of it that sits on the head- my head is not big so it’s just a little big for my taste. Otherwise, this is a great value for my pocket!",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Exactly what I was looking for.  I've been using them for a little over a week and am very happy with them.  I don't listen to a whole lot of music with them, so their use is more for Prime Video, etc. but they sound fine to me.  Sometimes (or maybe I should say often), even if there is no audio feeding, I continue to wear them in NC mode while I'm reading, and they muffle household sounds that would be distracting to a reader.  I'd say that's a definite bonus!",5,1,2018-4-27,1,1,0
"I don’t understand the hype with these headphones. They have a great presentation and the packaging is impressive. However, the volume is too low. I’m wondering if people got either a reimbursement or a discount in exchange for a good review. The volume is so bad that it makes me question the reliability of amazon’s reviews because there’s no way this can be objective. Either I got a faulty product or there’s something wrong with the reviews.",3,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I have to say, the price point for these is much lower than the brand names I usually buy. However, from opening the package onwards I could see Cowin is serious about presentation and quality.I was able to pair my headphones easily with my phone and the noise cancellation is impressive. I've vacuumed with the headphones and could hear the music without blasting it.",5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
The Headphones had the battery life I needed as the other ones would not last more then 1.5 hours and they sound great in the normal setting and block out most of the outside noise however in the noise cancellation mode It does block out little bit more outside noise but the sound is more muffled and shallower compared to when the noise cancellation is off so I try not to use it unless I am in a noisy area. I like the appearance of the unit and it is not too heavy. They are quite comfortable to wear. For the price I paid for them they are a great value compared to similar ones that cost much more and I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars just on headphone that might not last any longer then these,4,1,2018-1-10,1,0,0
"I have had 2 pairs of these headphones. The first pair did not work. I left a bad but true review and Cowin promptly reached out and  sent me another pair. The new pair works amazing, and I still use them almost everyday. Great headphones for the price, great customer service. If I ever need a replacement, I will look for the new versions of these headphones. Great product.It came to my attention that my review was never changed after around a year or more when Cowin contacted me saying they will refund me the whole price since I was still unsatisfied. I don't know why my old review was still up, as I recall changing it to 5 stars some time ago. My apologies to the amazing Cowin service, this product and your help truly deserves 5 stars.",5,1,2017-7-7,1,2,0

"I was enjoying using the E7 headphones. Then I discovered that the person in the next seat could hear much of what I was listening to. There was a great deal of sound leakage. Upgraded to E8 and the sound is beautiful. Drums of U2, ""I still haven't found"" were wonderful; clear voice of Beth Neilson Chapman in ""Ave Maria"" was a real treat. Sound leakage of the E8 is much less than the E7, but this is a factor that no manufacturer seems to deal with. I mentioned it to an electronics salesperson and they had never even considered it. Am I expecting too much in thinking that noise cancelling was a two way street?? On the other hand, these ARE VERY EXCELLENT HEADPHONES, if sound leakage doesn't matter.",4,1,2019-4-19,1,1,0
"Noise cancelling function is somewhat average. Sound quality of the headphones was surprisingly good though. A reasonable deal at $35 (Lightning Deal) but I wouldn't recommend anyone buy at full price.edit: After using these for a bit longer, while I still stand by my comments, I am happy with them (especially for the price) and note that somehow it seems even though these have average noise cancelling - most other manufacturers that aren't Bose or Sony somehow manage to do an even worse job at it! So actually these do well comparatively.",4,1,2018-1-9,1,0,0
"What a waste of money.  Worse bluetooth connection than a $20 earbud. When I move from one room to another, it loses connection; when I'm on the street, it loses connection; when I don't sit right, somehow it loses connection. I'm only listing a few major occasions when I oses connection,  there are more.  The call quality is equally bad, I've been told it sounded like I'm really far away it get echo.

"Got these for our 12 year old who has been through several “cheap” pairs of wired and wireless headphones. What drew my attention were the reviews claiming these are very durable. A must for a preteen boy who isn’t exactly gentle with things like this.So far, very pleased with the quality and durability! He’s only been using them for about 5 weeks, but so far so good.",4,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"underwhelming “noise cancellation” headphones at an overwhelming price. Not sure if I got a defective pair, but the noise cancellation does not work. I can hear people talking at the coffee shop I frequent, even with the noise cancellation feature on, and I often find myself plugging in my earphone, since those seem to block out more noise. The sound quality is ok, but I can’t recommend these for noise cancellation.",2,1,2020-1-26,1,1,0
"Can't find my previous review but the replacement set arrived today. The 1st set worked with bluetooth for only 1 day then quit for all my devices. This replacement set arrived today and bluetooth works with PCs and Galaxy S8 just fine. The noise cancellation is pretty good. For example when you have them on, you can hear your own breathing and heartbeat a bit. Flip the switch to NC (noise cancellation) and you hear nothing! If you listen to something that has inferior recording quality (many instructional youtube videos) you are not going to find these or any other device make the sound better. But good quality sound comes through as good quality on this headset. It is sad though that support is only by email. I guess that is due to the low prices.",5,1,2018-11-29,1,0,0
"I had ordered a pair and they had a minor hum/buzz when on. After contacting the seller they sent a replacement immediately. The new set worked perfectly. They are comfortable, provide an excellent battery life. I rarely charge them and only do because I feel they have sat around to long without a charge. The blue tooth connection is good and they have a far range. I have a few devices connected to them and I can transition without any issues. The sound quality is great but these are are not noise cancelling. They certainly are noise deafening but not cancelling. Even with that said I do enjoy the headphones and use them for almost everything. Also, they DO NOT connect to Xbox. (they come with an aux cable connection and it does not work with the xbox) But for the price and the quality associated I still am satisfied with this purchase.",5,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
I am happy with my purchase. I bought these to listen to my tv which is not smart. I was having trouble with the connection so I bought a blue tooth transmitter that makes both my smart and not smart tv's easy to hook up. I also bought a 4.5 ft micro USB cord to keep it charged and plugged in. The transmitter cost 30 and ear phones around 52 so still a lot less then Bose. No complaints so far. I also bought my husband a pair.,5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"In addition to the excellent sound quality, the headphone is lightweight, adjustable, and the material that makes up the ear muffs is very comfortable. The ear muffs rotate freely about two axis, allowing for a perfect fit over my ears and no excessive pressure (a real plus for me as I have a rather large head).  This nearly perfect fit helps provide good insulation from external noises.  The noise cancellation feature virtually eliminates any residual noises coming from ceiling fans and overhead heating or cooling vents in my house.  The Bluetooth feature works as expected. Pairing the headphone to my pc or to my Windows phone was straightforward.  All controls (volume up and down, play, pause, skip forward or backward) are on the same button and easy to use.  I have not had the opportunity to test the microphone yet or test the limits of the battery.  For the price, this headphone is a great value and I recommend it without any reservation.",5,1,2017-12-13,1,0,0
"This would be a 5 star except the instructions that come with it have super small writing, probably need a magnifying glass to read them.  Easy to pair with Bluetooth. It remembers the Bluetooth device when turned off so you don't have to pair again.  Good sound reproduction.  The fit is a little snug.  About the same weight as othe headsetsUpdate - had charging issues, red LED charging light would never go out.  Sent email to Corwin customer service and two short emails later they gave me a new replacement through Amazon.  About a week from when I first contacted customer service until I got the new headset.  Best customer service I have ever worked with.",4,1,2017-1-31,1,2,0
"Are you spending hundreds on other ""better"" brands? I was really hesitant when my cousin told me to try one of these. But man the deep bass in it definitely is same if not better quality than the old bose I own. For the price you can't get a better deal. After a fulll charge and playing music for approximately 25 hours so far, it is still working without having to recharge... so not sure how much longer it will last before next try. It is very comfortable and the music quality is superb. As for noise cancellation, it works very well in the car. I still need to try it in the airplane, but do not have a trip coming up anytime soon. Will update if i get a chance to do that soon.",5,1,2018-1-21,1,0,0
"I am an avid quilter. While I sew, I will watch (really I listen) tv. I keep Bluetooth headphones on so my family doesn’t have to watch what I’m watching on my iPad. I was looking for quality headphones that last. I needed a long battery life and good sound. I don’t want to hear my family talking or kids arguing. The noise cancellation on these is phenomenal! Sometimes the bass is so deep that the actual ear pieces vibrate. The battery will let me about three full days before I need to charge. Very sturdy and quality and I’ve been very pleased. I’m glad I splurged and spent a little extra money on getting something that is quality and lasts!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"UPDATED REVIEW:On the first go round, I gave these headphones three stars because the bluetooth cut out and the noise cancelling feature was not effective. The company quickly reached out without any prompting and offered a replacement set of headphones. They contacted me several times to set up the shipment and follow up to make sure I was happy with the new set, which I was--the bluetooth is much more effective as is the noise cancelling feature. The customer service was extraordinary, especially in this day and age.",5,1,2017-9-29,1,1,0

"I got these for my husband and he absolutely loves them! There is nothing to dislike about these headphones! The quality of the sound is excellent, once you have them on you can't hear external noises. He can use while on his cell phone, receive calls and disconnect when finished directly from the headphones, he can talk to people at a long distance (phone one place, him at another, about 5 or 6 feet away), and with its blue tooth he can watch his favorite shows on TV without bothering anyone! That’s a plus!! Again, the sound quality is absolutely great! He feels like he’s in own mini-theater. Forgot to mention, the color is perfect! Bright red, his favorite color! I highly recommend these, as a gift or for yourself!",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,1
"These Cowin headphones was a great purchase! It shipped in a nice, very well cushioned box. I was traveling overseas and wanted to be free and clear of any outside noise. It's noise-cancelling ability is stellar. It cancels without much noise in the background. It doesn't get as loud as I would like (although already pretty loud) but that's a great thing for my hearing. The sound quality is good. It doesn't muffle at elevated volume. I would definitely recommend!!",4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"For the cost these headphones can't be beat.  The noise cancelling is sufficient, the sound is great for a wireless pair of headphones and the bass is excellent if that's your thing.  Battery life seems to be good, though I have only gone through one recharge cycle so far.  Coming from a pair of Sony MDRs where the headband broke after a year of medium / light use I'm glad I decided to try something different.  The noise canceling options aren't as good as on the MDRs but the sound and battery life are definitely on par.  Build materials are definitely cheaper but build quality seems to be pretty good.  All in all very happy with a good set of noise canceling headphones and not having spent another $300 like I did last time.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"This headset rocks. After a dismal experience with another headset touting the same capabilities I was skeptical. I bought a $50 set from Sam's Club and it was abysmal. My first foray into a bluetooth headset that wasn't the traditional cell phone talk headset, I wasn't sure what to expect. The reviews got me and I returned the garbage I got from Sam's and bought this unit and I am elated. The sound quality is incredible. Battery life is fantastic. Connectivity and range is phenomenal and easy as all get out. Base thumps. It's a wonderful euphonic embrace for my ears and so totally worth the money.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

"I purchased my first pair of E7 in April 2019, because I had a supervisor (on a temp assignment) that would yell.  I tried to purchased another brand, and when I put them on, I could hear a whispered conversation across the room.  I gave up for over a year trying to find something that would cover the sounds of people talking on public transportation.  I found it with the E7.  I have traveled with them, they drown out the plane sounds and the people talking loud and I can't hear their conversations when talking low.  The minute I misplaced my April purchased ones, I purchased another E7, because I couldn't see going on the public transportation one more day without them. I didn't rate Bass, because my ears can't stand the Boom Boom of Bass, and I keep my music very low.  I only had to work with that boss for 1 month, but I think if I ever had to do that, then I think they would have helped drown out his yelling.",4,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0
"Here's your simple, care-free, honest review: This product does what is it designed to do and does it well! First: great pricing, sound quality perfect for me, reliable connectivity, practical to travel with, light and easy to fold, durable and comfortable.

Second: if you want to cancel out the world and focus on a great auditory experience at a great price, this is the product!",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"These do not turn themselves off when not in use, so they continue to drain themselves of battery if you forget to turn them off when you set them down.

"Update May 8 2017: my first pair received were very nice (I was impressed with the packaging, it would be a good first impression/presentation for a gift), but I was disappointed as I bought them specifically for the noise canceling feature. The seller kindly replaced the set with the noise canceling model and I'm now very content with the product. Just as nice looking and feeling as the first, but now with the desired noise canceling feature I was looking for. I have already recommended it to family members. Thank you for the good customer service!Older review-",5,1,2017-4-15,1,0,0
"It's a good product won't lie it does live up to it's expectation, but there are a couple of problems that I kind of found. For one these are not the best when running on the noise cancellation feature, any slight movement while the feature is enabled and it begins to statically mess up. The other ""problem"" that I didn't like was the the headphones had to be on in order to be able to use the aux cord, and the aux cord that came with the headphones was the worst. The aux cord didn't work and if I got it to work any slight movement of the aux cord will immediately make it stop working.",3,1,2018-9-29,1,2,0
"I'm no music expert, but I really liked these headphones -- they were surprisingly noise-canceling for the price, and sound quality and battery life were always good.

"Have had these for 1.5 years. You can absolutely not beat the price. I use these with an HDMI transmitter when watching TV and movies. The sound is amazing, I hear every word, sound and noise crystal clear, even has some bass to it. Also use them on my PC with a USB bluetooth plugged in. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made, and the fact they were 35$ is highway robbery. I suggest buying a HDMI transmitter for your TV and match these headphones up with them, you wont believe the difference in audio. I use these every day and have never had one issue connecting or any malfunctions, they have worked perfectly everyday. These come with my highest suggestion to buy.",5,1,2017-11-27,1,0,0
"I wanted to like these headphones. They're comfortable. They look nice. They shut out sound decently well without the active noise cancelling enabled. The sound quality was pretty good too unless you enable the active noise cancellation. The active cancellation was lackluster, but I knew that from the reviews. They shutout droning noises like a fan or engine, but do nothing against talking or other sporadic noises. However, there are two primary issues that made these a return item for me.1. You can't these wired without them being charged. I expected that using the audio cable I could plug these in while the headphones were turned off and they would just work like other headphones I've owned. They do not. Having the option to plug them in when the battery is dead is a must for me.",2,1,2017-10-13,1,3,0
"I am not an expert on headphones, but compared to the skull candy I had before it covers your ears perfectly.  What I first noticed was how balanced they were and that they sat on my head and I did not have to keep adjusting them.  When I bought these I did not pay attention that they had a deeper bass.  From my experience it was not overwhelming nor annoying for this old senior citizen.  Excellent value for the price.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I bought a pair for my son because I already had a pair and he liked them so much that he wanted a pair.  They're so comfy that sometimes he wears them just because when he's studying or reading.  The only down side to these is that they don't work with a computer for mic + headphones. They just work as headphones.  They work as mic + headphones with a bluetooth connection, not with the wired connection.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"I ordered these headphones specifically for the Amazon Choice designation and the greaT reviews, i chose them so I could listen to audio books while the  TV is on in the same room, or music is playing.  Even though the book I was listening to featured an extremely dynamic narrator and I had the volume at a medium high level, I was still distracted by the words to songs playing in the background. And yes, I checked to ensure that I had the noise cancelling function activated.My hope was to get true noise cancellation at a reasonable price. Perhaps this isn't realistic.",2,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
I love these headphones. I needed a headphone because I don’t like using earbuds. These are over the ear and very comfortable. I love that they are wireless.

"These are some very sleek, nice looking headphones that are very simple to setup and use, and are a joy to use at that. I find them very comfortable to wear, the fit very well, don't cause too much pressure, but don't feel like they are going to fall off either. The sound is great for the price point, and I'd definitely buy them again. The microphone works great as well, and people can hear me clearly in conversations, they don't even know I'm talking to them using Bluetooth headphones. The battery life is amazing! My only complaint is the noise canceling feature. I don't find that it works that well, and when music is playing with the noise canceling feature turned on, it sounds distorted and like you're having the music through a tunnel. Otherwise, i think these are a great purchase, and I'm glad to have bought them.",4,1,2017-11-1,1,0,0

But  the hinge broke, most likely due to the plastic part that holds them together, was very careful with them, alway kept in cloth bag and rarely used.

The noise cancelling is good, maybe the Bose is better but using my wife's pair I couldn't tell a huge difference. The battery life is amazing. I used them on a trip to Europe, forgot my charger, and a week later after daily use (and several constant hours of use on flights) still going. Also, quite comfortable.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Overall, considering the price, sound quality, and durability, I would give these headphones a solid 5/5 rating. I’ve owned mine a year now and use them on nearly a daily basis on my commute, which includes train rides and long walks. While I would not call these truly “noise cancelling”, they do cancel out a fair amount of white noise. Honestly, that’s good enough for my use and leaves me comfortable enough to use while walking in downtown Chicago, as I want to ensure I can hear traffic for my own safety. I’ve dropped these a few times and am impressed at their durability.Sound quality is also excellent for this price range. They are also very comfortable, though I do need to take them off every couple of hours to give my ear a break.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"Just got these today. I'm very impressed with them. It's the sweet spot for sound quality vs price.  The higher models won't give you better sound. Although it'snot  really multi-device, I'm only using this with my computer for listening to music, but I paired it with my phone, and it works great as a headset, and very comfortable.  I was at Best Buy over the week listening to the Sony WH1000XM3, and almost popped on those.  Honestly, in wired mode, which is what they had at Best Buy, there's little difference I can notice between Sony and these. Glad I saved about $250.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"These are a waste. The sound cancelling doesn't work at all. The sound quality is decent but nothing special. I love bass and these basically have none.

"I got these headphones to wear while riding my lawn tractor for hours while mowing. They were very comfortable to wear with ample padding around the ears. While the sound quality is very good, with plenty of deep bass sound, I find little noise-cancelling of the tractor motor.

"It is the BEST $50-$60 I've EVER SPENT. I tried these out when I got these the next day after I ordered them and when I felt the bass of my music vibrate in my ears I instantly said to myself: ""I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!"" The noise-canceling is a 4-star rating because of the fact that it doesn't cancel out all noise, but most of it at least if you crank it up to 100%. I was nervous about other people's reviews at first, but I quickly got over them and tried them out for myself since out of 13,000+ reviews, almost 80% were at 5-stars, so I wasn't too worried. Someone told me to turn down the volume before using them as it was already cranked up; I did that, and then I started to take a liking to them entirely, in fact, as I write this review I'm still wearing them and listening to music on them. Just a little advice though, turn off noise cancellation (middle setting next to off I think) when walking across the streets or something because if you're not paying close attention you might get yourself hit or ran over.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

I had to finally bend the top of the headset just so no pressure would be put on the ear so I could make it through the rest of the flight. I haven't abused them (they haven't even traveled much, they usually stay in my office), so having them just fall apart was kind of a bummer.Update: I reached out to the seller, sent them a picture and my purchase info, and they replaced the headphones.

Just got the E7 headphones a couple days ago but have had the chance to use them while mowing the lawn and on my daily walks. They are very easy to connect using bluetooth on 2 different phones & my mini Mp3 player. Never lost connectivity even when I accidently shut them off while trying to switch between BT & NC. Had to restart app on phone but the E7's came right back on. The sound quality is very good and maybe even better in NC mode. Don't know if that will affect battery life. The Noise Cancellation seems to work well too. It quieted the sound of my lawn mower and traffic noise while walking though my subdivision.  I also like that the earcups swivel. They feel more comfortable to me with L & R reversed. Just went back & switched between phones & Mp3 player using bluetooth to test. Easy Peasy Baby! I hope I don't need it but the 18 month warranty sounds pretty good too. I would definitely  recommend them.,5,1,2019-4-24,1,0,0
"These seem to work well.  I wear them in the gym 3 days a week and play my big playlist via Bluetooth.  They block 100% of the ambient gym noise and the music quality is good.  Also I use them with my lawn mower and leaf blower, with music.  They block the sound of those engines but not completely at all.  They do as well as my good pair of ear protectors, but not much if any better.  This is a difficult subjective judgement, however.",4,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"The packaging and the headphones were very impressive when I received them.  This was my first time buying this brand and wanted a good set, but not willing to spend the $300 or so for Beats.  I was anxious to try them but found them to have no charge.  The charge time was suppose to be 4 hours (seemed really long) but was fully charged after 2 hours.  Connection to my various devices was easy and I was up and running quickly.  Controls are very intuitive.  When I was connected to my iPhone I had problems with maintaining a steady signal and kept getting ""skips"" in the music.  My phone was getting low so I plugged it in, and that seemed to get rid of the signal issue.  Not sure why the signal was weak with a lower battery, so I just make sure that if I am using my phone with the headphones that I make sure the phone has a good charge or I have it plugged in.  I would recommend these headphones to anyone.  If you want really deep base then you will have to pay more, but for my use, $60 was a low price for the value received.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"These pairs are better than expected. The sound quality is crisp like some nice buttermilk crispy chicken. The bass is definitely in my top 3 for headphones. It is what is advertised and it's a GREAT product. The active noise canceling is OK. It does reduce a lot of noise and the sound is better with it. On an airplane or a train, they would do the job, just not the best. I mean really, if you want better noise canceling than these, you'll have to pay $200+. For the price of these headphones, everything is perfect, if not better!",5,1,2019-6-13,1,1,0

If they're not positioned perfectly, there's a weird vacuum effect/sound that's really uncomfortable and requires a lot of fidgeting/adjusting to get rid of.

"Just bought this Cowin E-7 Active noise cancelling headphones to reduce the jet engine noise while on a recent plane trip. Was disappointed that they did not do more than muffle the sound but that was due to the earphones sitting so nicely around the ears. The N.C. switch had little or no any affect  and the volume control on the earpiece did not work when pressed up or down. The volume had to be controlled by the T.V. switch on the airplane. Wore them for one and a half movies on the flight and I could understand clearly the dialog. They were comfortable for that period of time. When I got back home I tried them on my computer to see if the volume would work from the earpiece, but it would not. Had to use the volume control on my computer to adjust the volume to a nice listening level . The music sounded wonderful to my ears.So I e-mailed customer support and explained the problem and "" Joey""  responded back very quickly saying he would send a replacement and to give it another try. It arrived very quickly and I plugged it into my computer and the volume control on the headset now works perfectly. Then I took it outside and sat next to the air conditioner compressor and flipped the N.C. switch off and on a few times and it definitely made a difference. The loud roar was reduced to a soft swish so these headphones do what they are advertised to do and the customer service was great. If you have any trouble, just e-mail ""Joey"" He will keep you happy. Thanks.",5,1,2017-8-10,1,1,0
"First things first. I like these headphones a lot! The sound quality is great. Good base. Great volume. Comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Battery lasts well over a day of heavy use. Even without the noise canceling on, they don't allow a lot of surrounding sound in. For the price, I would buy these again.On the flip side, the noise cancelling leaves a bit to be desired. If it is on, the base on the audio is nearly non-existent. Audio becomes quite ""tinny"". Also, if you bump the headphones while NC is on, it creates a pretty distracting ""distortion"" in the audio. I just don't use the NC since the ""over the ear"" muffles everything around me anyway.",4,1,2019-3-17,1,0,0
"For the price, you can't beat this deal. Noise cancelling is mostly from how the headphones seal around the ears. The electronic noise cancelling effect is minimal. Very comfortable. I use at work when charting. Sometimes, I forget to turn on my music and realize I am using them for the pure mechanical sound cancelling effect. These would not work well for an airplane noise cancelling. I have a pair of Bose, wired noise cancelling (Quiet Comfort 15) that are superior to these in both comfort and noise cancelling but I paid four times as much. This pair of Cowin headphones can be left at work and if lost, there is minimal loss. Sound quality is acceptable.",5,1,2017-7-8,1,1,0
Got these about 6 weeks ago and have used for 3 flights so far when watching movies on an iPad or listening to music on my phone. Used twice for taking calls and it seemed okay. They work excellent and have been comfortable enough to wear for 6 hours straight. Noise cancelling is really good...maybe not quite as good as a pair of Bose but easily 80% as good and at a fraction of the cost! Battery life seems good...haven’t had any issues with 6-8 hours of use and normally just leave them on when on a layover or flight change. Definitely recommend these.,5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"I was not expecting much from a $60 pair of Bluetooth noice cancelling headphones but was very surprised with the E7s. I hate earbuds especially since to get any bass out of them, you need to have a complete seal between the tip and your ear. Even when f you move around, the bass comes and goes, so I was looking for an over the ear headphone I could use on the plane or when mowing the lawn. I found the sound to be very bass heavy in normal mode, but when I put them into the noise cancel mode, the bass dropped a bit and they seemed to open up. The noise cancelling isn't equal to a $250 pair of Bose but I wouldn't expect expect that. I does a nice job of removing the bottom end rumble though which is the most annoying part.  I wish they were a bit more open but at $60 they are an unbelievable bargain and a joy to listen to. I've heard a lot worse for much more.  I am considering looking into the E8 as well. It just goes to show you that there are very good products out there that don't need to charge an arm and a leg",4,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0

My husband is hard of hearing and as such turns TV up too loud and I am an avid reader but typically I keep re-reading the same passage because I am hearing his TV.

"I bought these headphones because of an article I read saying they are better than beats for $50. Overall they are just okay. Out of the box they felt a bit cheap. They were easy to setup and are easy to use. The sound quality is not good. My AKG Y50's sound WAY better. These are more comfortable since they are ""over ear"" vs ""on ear"" with my AKG's. The noise canceling works well. Battery life is pretty good. They are not bad but I wouldn't buy them again.",3,1,2019-2-4,1,1,1
"I was initially very impressed with the noise cancellation, sound quality, base quality and battery life. However, after about 6 months of use one day the volume would not reach previous max when connecting with bluetooth. I assumed something was wrong with my phone so I tried pairing with other bluetooth sources and the volume remains faint when connected via bluetooth. So I began using the option head phone chord and was pleased to hear the volume levels restored. But after 1 month of using the chord it began to short out. Fortunately, I have more 3.5mm chords so I can still salvage use of these. However, I would prefer the bluetooth. These headphones were amazing for the first 6 months.",2,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0
"I specifically bought these headphones for the active noise cancelling. It is not existent.

"These headphones are not as great as the reviews would lead you to believe. The sound quality is muffled and the bass is weak. It would get a 5 star review maybe back in 2008 for $60 but that’s outdated technology that is not worth your money.After purchasing and realizing they’re not that great, I read through the reviews and found most of the people who gave 5 stars clearly have not had good headphones in their lives.

I wrote the review below about the clicking noise and less than a week later they called and texted me to help with the issue and replaced the headphones and upgraded them for the inconvenience.  This is the best customer support I've had on an Amazon product in memory.

It was barely noticeable when I got them but has gotten unbearable since.,5,1,2019-1-22,1,0,0
This would be a three star review except for the service the seller provides. My bluetooth headphones are fantastic and sound great except when I turn on ANC(active noise control) there is a thumping noise out of the right earphone during quite parts at beginning and end of songs. I emailed support asking them if this is something I could fix or if they knew a solution; they replied with a code for a replacement pair as this was a defect with the headphones.I purchased these 6/16/2017 so I've only owned them for a week and only worn 2 or 3 times as I plan to use them at work and there was a weekend in between. Love the ANC even with the thumping as it only happens during those quiet times.,4,1,2017-6-28,1,1,0
"For the price, you cannot go wrong. Really good active noise cancelling. I wish these came with a hard case, but I guess this is how they keep the cost lower than similar items. They are obviously not the top of the line in sound quality, but they are still very excellent. You are not paying >$100. You get wireless with a mic and ANC. The only negative I have is that the cords that come with the headphones are very, very cheap. These should come with an in-line mic cord and good quality usb charging cord. They do not.I have yet to discover if you can add an in-line mic cord and it work.",5,1,2017-12-8,1,0,0
"I really hate being that guy but I am returning these. First, let me say that delivery, packaging, and over all experience was good. The headphones themselves are actually very nice and very comfortable. The noise cxl feature works great also, and the charge lasts significantly longer than any other ones I've owned. So why am I returning them? One reason and one reason only. If you like loud, these may not be for you. I liked everything else about these headphones with volume being the only exception. Bass is good, mids and highs are ok, and overall these sound great if you are on a budget and need the noise cxl feature. When at full volume however, the bass became distorted in the right ear, even though I still felt like they need to be louder. I am giving a different set a try but if I don't find a significant improvement, I will re-order these because I really do like them. I hope this helps if you're on the fence.",3,1,2017-6-20,1,0,0
"These are awesome.  I’ve never had noise canceling headphones so I’m like a little kid playing with a light switch.  I’m at work with a ton of background machines running and the noise cancel switch makes them go away!  There is a slight pressure sensation with noise canceling on.  This may be normal or it could be just me, I’ve always had ear pressure problems.(diving/flying).  Sound is great, sharp and distortion free. Definitely would recommend",5,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0
"I did a lot of research online, and I decided to choose these headphones because of the consistent good reviews. It had every feature I wanted for an affordable price. These headphones were better than I expected - they were comfortable, clear, noise cancelling worked, had a decent range. But I mainly needed the bluetooth feature so that I could use it for non-stop work calls and still move around a little and away from my laptop while I am working from home. After one day, the bluetooth completely stopped pairing with any of my electronic devices (personal phone, work phone, laptop). I read the instructions, reset the bluetooth settings multiple times... but nothing happened. The bluetooth indicator is on, but it doesn't show up to pair to my devices. It still works well if you connect with the 3mm wire, but the main reason I needed these headphones is for the bluetooth feature. I went back and found one or two reviews that mention this problem as well. I am very disappointed. I will have to return these.",3,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
I love these headphones they're soft and they don't seem to be made of poor quality for their price. They're great to use on airplanes or during study halls or I use them to try and ignore my kids shows that are going on in the background. I have left them on overnight I usually get about two to three days off of a full charge so I'm very impressed with these headphones and will purchase them again as backups when this pair keels over.,5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0

"Apparently sounds like I am underwater when making calls. These function great as just regular headphones, but not exactly what I was looking for. The noise cancellation is only for the headphones themselves and the mic does not cancel out background noise.

"Usually I'm skeptical of the ""1 star reviews"" on a product with exceptional ratings on amazon, but these headphones really takes the cake here for being highly overrated not worth the money, and the current total rating does not represent the quality of these headphones at all!Sound: My biggest complaint is that the sound quality is absolutely horrendous. Everything sounds ""muffled"" so the only thing you can realistically listen to are pop songs and even then the sound quality is still pretty bad.",1,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"While it works as intended and the sound quality is pretty good. They however grip your head too hard which is an ergonomic problem since they don't quite fit around ears and there's additional discomfort if you wear glasses. Another problem I ran into is if the batteries fall below 90% one of the speakers starts making a constant wooshing sound that causes some discomfort that doesn't quite go away if there is sound coming out of them. If you like wearing them wired to save battery power it experiences interference from the power provided by the wired connection, and this is true if you decide to have it in use with the batteries being recharged by a USB charger.Overall while the sound quality and noise cancellation works as advertised you can feel how cheaply it is made and the cheap parts surrounding those parts that make it work has a detrimental effect on the rest of the experience. You are more than likely better off with a different brand at the same price.",1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
Update: I have now tried both the E7 and E8. You get what you pay for. If it was me I would skip the E7 and pay a little more for the E8. The sound quality is excellent and it comes with all the accessories you need. Also Cowin customer service is excellent.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,1,0
"First of all, I was especially looking for a comfortable headset so that I would be able to cancel the noise as possibly as I could and the sound perfomance of the set is able to cover the noise cancelling part however the sound quality is as good as a standard set. It's unable to perform a clear quality action when the sound is on the full point but with a point or two decrease, it gets to the best performance that it could. Bass quality is not very charming, you can hear it but you can't feel it, I don't know how else to put it. It's good but limited. Overall a 3.5 out of 5 star product to me.",4,1,2019-8-28,1,1,0

I have been buying real cheap bluetooth headsets to wear while cutting the grass on a large commercial grade riding mower.  The cheap ones had very little volume, no noise cancelation, and the battery life per charge got worst with each use.I wasn't going to pay  2 to 3 hundred dollars for noice cancelling headsets to cut grass with.  Based upon reviews, cost, and battery life I purchased the COWIN's.  They have great volume and sound while riding on the mower.  Noice cancelation is a 7 or 8 out 10 while on the noisy mower.  Not sure if any headset could be a 10 in this situation.  I listen to music and/or talk radio while mowing.  The volume and sound quality is very, very good.  I have also tried them in the house with the home entertainment system and am very impressed with the performance of the CORWIN.

I needed something quickly and just couldn't justify the expense of replacing them with another pair of Bose since I wasn't flying as much as I had done previously. I picked these because they seemed like a good size and came in color. Wow! What a surprise. I truly believe the sound cancelling is significantly better than my old Bose set and the sound quality is amazing...especially for the price. They are comfortable to wear for long periods. I love the bluetooth capabilities. The battery lasts for a LONG time. If you are looking for quality at a modest price, look no further. This is it!",5,1,2018-9-5,1,0,0
"I bought this in hopes of finding a set of headphones that were less expensive than Sony or Bose.  Overall, I'm pretty pleased with them.  I'm a bald guy, so they do stick out from my head quite a bit.  They are not low profile by any means and do not have the slim, sleek look that their newer versions do.  People will definitely know you're wearing knock-off headphones.  But for the price, I'm pretty pleased.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"Edit/Update:Cowin customer service took the initiative and sent out a replacement. After charging and pairing, the audio is fine. Wireless and wired, none of the distant/muffled audio problems I originally reported were present. It was like a different set of headphones and quite good in performance.",5,1,2017-6-20,1,0,0
"Great headphones overall. I mostly use these for gaming, and mild music levels in the background typically while I stream. For gaming: excellent. I use these primarily in FPS games to identify where sounds are coming from and they're great for that. For music: not great. The speakers sounded blown when I first got them when it came to listening to music with a lot of lows. I primarily listen to rap/hip hop that have many lows, therefore lots of bass and these are not satisfactory for high volume levels of that. In fact, I can't really listen to it above half volume without crackling/popping noises, even on regular videos sometimes, just depends on the what lows are playing. Comfortability: decent. I can wear them for usually 2-4 hours without much annoyance, which is good in my books. The sliding size adjusters are quality, easy to use and stay in place for the most part. I purchased a bluetooth usb port for my computer because I don't have one built in; I like how I can get up and walk to the kitchen/bathroom without losing connection for the most part, which can be upwards of 20-30 feet.",4,1,2017-7-18,1,1,0
First Cowin headphones I've owned and they are impressive. I like wondering around the bedroom without wires attached while watching movies. These have great sound for my needs and stay connected well. I have had several pairs of Sony's and these are right up there in bass and quality. I'm not much for noise cancellation so I can't speak for that but these are a really nice set for the money!,5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"I have a typical, 78-year-old, hearing loss on both the high end and low end of the audio spectrum. These phones seem to have the best response at their high - and low - frequencies.  That's a good match for me.If I were 40 years younger, I'd give them only four stars because of the variations in their frequency response.. But now, I find them quite geezer friendly. Also, they are quite comfortable and the noise cancelling works well. For someone my age, they are an excellent value. I'd have to spend a lot more money to get phones which are only marginally better than these.",5,1,2017-1-12,1,1,0
"I bought these to listen to audio books and after several months I am very happy with them.  I can sit or lay in bed and listen to my book with no distraction because of the noise-cancelling feature.  The sound quality and volume (adjustable) are perfect for me and they are comfortable to wear.  I now also use them to listen to music while doing projects.  They are bluetooth, so I can move around without worrying about wires.  Definitely more than I expected when I bought them.",5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0
"I bought these noise cancelling headphones for a recent vacation.  And it's a good thing, because we had the LOUDEST FROGS IN THE WORLD outside our hotel (ended up sleeping with the headphones a couple of nights).  These are fabulous!  Sound is wonderful, and the headphones are so comfortable!  I now use them for my daily commute - 2+ hours total each day, and I finally had to charge them again after three weeks.

"I first gave this product one star because since out of the box, it does not charge, in-turn work.  I have tried all the different ways mentioned, but to no avail.  Called Amazon Tech support and they were nice but couldn't help me.  Cowin support is not opened on weekends, so Amazon said they would call me back the next day but didn't.  I called Amazon back and they apologized, could not get ahold of Cowin, and are sending a new replacement the next day.  Really hoping that one works.  I will update rating again once I get replacement up and running.  Got my replacement and it worked right of the box, yay! After adjusting the sound on my phone, the headphones sound awesome! With that said, because of the customer service with Amazon, changing to a 4-star.",4,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0

"The bass on this E7 headphone is very good, but I compared the raw sound quality to my old headphones and found that I preferred sound with less bass in it. There is probably some program to turn down the bass, but I really wish these headphones had some type of equalizer.There's also the microphone that works better than my laptop's.",4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"Well these are really terrific headphones: comfortable, adjustable, and the sound is super clear.  I didn't use the noise cancelling feature often but when I did on the airplane it did a good job taking out the sound of the engine!  However, the headphone broke on one side and now they're unusable.  Kind of disappointing as I used them for about a year.  I expected them to last a lot longer, especially since the technical end was solidly working until the end.  $60 is a lot knowing that they're going to tank in a year.",3,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"The noise canceling part worked on an airplane but in the office not as much.  Still, they do drown out the chatter of my co-workers well enough.  They are comfortable.  Sound quality is good.  The best part is the battery life.  I figured I'd get through most of the work week before needing to charge.  I get through the entire work week w/o needing to charge!  The battery life is amazing!",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
I use my headphones every evening and my last KOSS phones (more expensive) kept being scratchy sounding and had to turn off and on to fix... then they broke in half as the plastic was no where near strong enough... so I tried these and so far I'm VERY impressed...  they are extremely well built and heavy duty and work much better than the KOSS...  I have already recommended them to others...  well done Cowin,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"Just got these and after having Beats Solo wireless headset that was never comfortable and hurt my head and ears from the beginning, these are wonderful! So very comfy!!! After my warranty just expired on my Beats, the wireless went out and Apple was nice enough to tell me that it happens all the time but they would be glad to repair them for $179 - I only paid $199 for them!  These were well worth it after only an hour of wearing them - so happy thus far.  I will update more as I use them.",5,1,2017-12-4,1,2,0
"When it works, it works well.  Has a habit of dropping the connection or the output sound preference on Iphone and especially Macbook Air.  Only way I've found to get it back is to power cycle the head set.  A tech had me reset the headphones but the dropped connection habit persists.Update:  sent them back.  Will note that customer service was over the top, so I upped the rating to 4 stars.",4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"For the price, I was expecting to receive something that was possibly of a lower quality than other items. These, however, are really great! They are perfect to erase the background noise of my office and my home when simply on NC mode. When playing music, they are wonderful both in the normal mode and in noise canceling. Sound quality is great and after several days of near constant use through the work-day, these are certainly on my ""needs"" list from here-on. I'd definitely recomment.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Not bad for the price. Noise cancellation didn't really do anything for me. I couldn't tell if it was on or off. This set though was much better than the one my wife bought me at the max store for more money than I gave for this one. Don't worry, I gave this one away and kept her gift because I love her. That said, I still want a ""real"" set of noise cancellation Bluetooth headphones later.",4,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I bought this headphone out of the impulsive need to desperately silence out cacophony at the office. When it arrived, I was surprised by the good build, much better than I expected for the price of this headphone. It looked much bulkier in the picture but the package of this thing was quite compact. My worry about the bulky size was unwarranted. Setup was easy. When I put it on my head, suddenly my noisy surrounding was gone!! I couldn’t believe it. It is also light and very comfortable on my ears. This thing is much better than my $$$ Noise cancelling headphones from branded names. The sound coming from this headphone is also awesome and quite balanced. I could put this thing in my office without have to worry about losing much expensive ones. The only cons is the container pouch is too tight/small and i had to struggle putting this thing in and out of that pouch but no big deal. I’m getting the hard case which is sold separately. I’m yet to test the battery life though but considering other feedbacks, I believe this thing will last through my daily work time range and more (so far i have been using from noon to late afternoon).",5,1,2018-3-12,1,0,0
I was so excited to get these today; but there is something wrong with them. There is a bad vibrating noise every time I try to use these as a headset. I’ve done basic troubleshooting but they are still not working. Very disappointed.,1,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"I purchased these with minimal investigation because my other brand broke again.I am very happy with these.  My ears are not sensitive to quality audio due to 35 years of jet engine and high noise environment surroundings, but i am happy with these.  they tune out chatty coworkers while giving me quality sound for music or vocals.",5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"My ratings are based on comparison with product of similar price, namely the non-noise cancelling Skullcandy I previously owned and liked very much. Noise cancelling works very well in my house and to my ears. The headphones themselves block a substantial amount of sound even with noise cancelling turned off.Sound quality took a moment to get used to. I was not used to so much base in a bluetooth headset. Very impressive.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"These headphones are solid. Good noise cancellation, they feel alright on the head, battery is incredible (I'd guess about 30+ hours without needing a charge). If you want to nitpick, they don't sit well around the neck/shoulders area (they choke you if you do that) and the buttons are a bit flimsy and hard to learn, so you may accidentally skip to the next song instead of turning up the volume.That said, after about a year of use, the part that connects the headphones to the earmuffs--and twists the earmuffs--snapped (see pic). So when I put them on, the right earmuff kinda floats off my head. And it wasn't user error.",5,1,2019-6-23,1,0,1
"I bought the COWIN E7 bluetooth headphones as my first bluetooth headset. Given the price, I was expecting middling sound quality, poor noise cancellation and flat bass. I could not have been more wrong! The sound quality far exceeded that of my previous pair of premium, wired over-the-ear headphones, the noise canceling feature is absolutely essential for a noisy work environment, and the bass rings true across a wide variety of music genres. The battery life is fantastic. I use them for 9+ hours per day, 7 days a week, and only have to charge them overnight a single night out of the week. When making calls, the mic is more than adequate for detecting my voice no matter the background noise, and I can hear my calls with perfect accuracy.Furthermore, this headset is comfortable, and I haven't had any issues with pairing them to any of my devices (PC, laptop, tablet, and phone).",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"These are my first pair of over the head headphones, and i'm definitely not a sound critic, but these were good headphones and the charge lasts a long time! My only complaint is the fit was less than satisfactory. I saw some reviews of people saying their ears hurt after long wears. I didn't think I would have any problems since my ears are pretty small. Unfortunately that was not the case and I had some discomfort after an hour or two.  However - I'm glad I bought these and they are a good starter for my 'over the head headphones lifestyle'. They are getting lots of use during this time when my husband and I are both working from home.",4,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"I have never owned a pair of headphones before at all, so this was entirely new to me. I do feel that the sound quality is very nice, but then again I have nothing to compare it to. Moreover, the headphones are quite bulky in my opinion, and if you wear them for longer than probably an hour or so your ears will begin to hurt (as with most headphones I am sure). It is also uncomfortable to put your head in certain positions while wearing the headphones. Another hassle that you should consider is that if you connect the headset to multiple devices, it’s probably going to be a hassle to get them to connect to the device you actually want, particularly because the device automatically connects to the most recently used device rather than the one nearest to you. Despite all of this, I do really like these headphones and am sure to be using them on any of my upcoming flights.",5,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"Noise cancellation is effective for what it's designed for, and even for some things it isn't. For an airplane or other similar background noises, the cancelling setting works very well. For other noises like voices, I find it actually works best without the cancellation turned on.

"they seem to be built decently with a few flaws, the bass isn't as good as other reviewers make it out to be, the sound is just a little flat, the ear cups are on the small side so unless you've got smaller ears theyre gojna fit tight and if you'vegot larger ears they'regonna fit like on ear headphones, there's a ton of padding over the speakers which dulls the sound significantly and the earcups are glued in place, they're decent for the price but I wouldn't pay more than $45 for them, if you want something that actually sounds good at this price point just get a set of oneodio a70 headphones, they're not noise canceling and they're not as durable but in terms of audio quality thehre leagues beyond these.",4,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"I love these headphones!  They are very comfortable to use on your ears.  They truly are very high quality - don't let the price fool you.

I had high hopes for these headphones with the great reviews. They weren’t good at all. The microphone was absolutely terrible. There was no noise cancelling at all and the sound was not good. They were also uncomfortable. Over-all the price was the only redeeming factor.,2,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0
I don’t know that I would call them noise canceling it muffles most of it but then again my kid could literally talk through anything. The battery life is amazing! (Make sure you switch them off to charge.) they are very comfortable to wear for long periods,4,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0

If you are looking for noise canceling headphones and the noise canceling feature is important to you then these headphones are NOT for you. The sound quality is fine and the Bluetooth works ok.... just don’t put a wall between the headphones and your phone/computer.

"I'm hellbent on going deaf apparently. These don't ""rattle"" on your ears. The Bass is not terrible. It's just not enough lol. The other issue is the sound ""leaks"" so keep those emotional tunes and a safe volume when on the bus ha ha.EVERYTHING ELSE IS AMAZING. If you have been cheap about earphones as I have been the construction and the weighty-ness of the product will standout. The Battery life is astounding. I would probably buy these again or another type from Cowin.",4,1,2019-3-3,1,0,0

I have hearing loss and wear in ear-hearing aids but I still had trouble hearing all of the sounds from the TV, particularly speech.  I added a Bluetooth transmitter to the optical output and these Cowin headphones quickly and easily paired with it.  I can now hear things on the TV that I couldn’t before.  They also have an active noise cancelling feature that I will use with my yard equipment.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"First time buyer of ""noise-cancelling"" headphones. Overall, I like them, especially for the price. Sound quality is excellent, bluetooth is easy to use and they are comfortable for to wear for extended periods of time. I will say if you are using them with no sound and just using the noise cancelling function they are not super effective to actually cancel out noise. I bought them to use for studying and this was a major feature I was looking for and they aren't that good at blocking out noise without music or something else playing, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.",4,1,2017-6-27,1,2,0
"The most important thing to remember with these headphones is value. The sound you’re getting is really, really good. The noise canceling doesn’t work very well when you’re walking/running, but if you’re sitting on a plane or stationary, it’s great.My right headphone broke on the part where it rotates. After dealing with Amazon for a couple of days, I was put in touch with the company who sent me a replacement pair (because they were under warranty) without even making me return the broken ones. No questions. No hassle. And I got them the next day.",5,1,2018-2-22,1,0,0

Anything I  watch comes alive in my ears. The experience is comparable and maybe even better than a home theater set up... without disturbing anyone in the vicinity. The base and tone are indeed awesome. In the end I was hesitant at first with all of the positive reviews. These were simply a great investment that is all.",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
i decided to get some headphones since all I do is study. I was especially interested in these because of the noise cancellation feature. I study a lot in the library on campus and it can get kinda noisy. These headphones are truly amazing!!!!! The nose cancelling feature works so well! I can barely hear a thing. They fit very nice and don't fall off if i start moving around. Not only that but the battery life is phenomenal! These are totally worth the buy! Highly recommend!,5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I used to wonder why people bothered with these ""fancy"" headphones, since basic earbuds usually work okay. Now I understand why people rave about these so much. I bought these about six months ago to replace some basic earbud headphones. These are incredibly comfortable, have a long battery life, seem to charge back up pretty quickly, reliably connect via bluetooth to my phone, and (to my novice ear) have pretty good sound quality. I've used them on an airplane (never traveling without them again, noise canceling is awesome), in front of a large fume hood blower at work (I usually would have to have my earbuds at max volume to even hear music, now I can have it at just above the minimum volume setting), while working out, and even to block out tropical noise while sleeping on vacation. They've worked perfectly and held up well. Highly recommend for the price.",5,1,2019-5-10,1,0,0
"I've only used these a couple times (and almost entirely on airplanes) so can only say that they've been pretty decent so far (with the noise cancelling easily the weakest feature as at best it's only able to drown out ambient noise like plane engines but not much else).  The sound quality is pretty good, not amazing but better than I was expecting for the price.  The cans are also fairly comfortable though they can get hot if wearing for any extended periods.  Overall would recommend if you're looking for a pair of decent quality, budget Bluetooth headphones but not for the ANC and definitely not if you're looking for very high quality sound (you'd be much better off shelling out the additional dinero for the higher end models that have been touched on repeatedly in other reviews).",4,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones and the seem to be well made. The sound is great and they are easy to connect to my laptop, IPAD and IPHONE 11.

The mute worked for other apps but I found out the hard way that they don't with my companies Messenger / conference application.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"Overall the headphones do a good job of noise canceling and the sound quality is solid. It filters out the engine noise from a plane pretty well but you still hear conversations unless you turn up the volume on whatever you are listening to. The sound quality seems to have a good range with good bass. They are comfortable to wear on long trips. I prefer my Sony noise canceling when at home but they are not wireless. The convenience of wireless while traveling is worth the trade off.These headphones are really tough to beat for the price. You'll have to pay a considerable amount more to get a better quality product. For the occasional traveling I do, these work well. If I traveled more I would probably invest in a better set. Overall I'm pretty happy with the purchase.",4,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0

I wanted a noise cancelling device for at work, to block out distractions to help me focus on priority projects.  When they arrived, I was pleased to see the packaging, which protected the headphones and included a nice travel bag to keep them in.The first use was through Bluetooth connection- no problem pairing to my outdated iphone 6s.  Since I sit at a desk, there was no noise interruption at all.  The noise cancelling worked perfectly for my needs- could still hear some muffled sounds, enough for me to be aware someone might be trying to get my attention.  but with music playing i could not hear any sounds unless someone was yelling at me.  A week later, I am still impressed.  I would definitely buy again.",5,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0

These headphones are quite simply fantastic.  The earpads on the headphones allow all day use without any discomfort or irritation.  Unlike other headphones I've owned these don't cause you to sweat and have the headphones stick to your head.  I own a woodworking business and the noise reduction of the headphones allows me to work all day oblivious to the various pieces of equipment I have running.  Excellent sound quality with good base that does rattle your brain around.  The noise reduction is better than the various sets of 29db noise reduction headphones I have accumulated in the shop and allow me to listen to my favorite music or take phone calls without interruption while I work.  These headphones are one of the best purchases I've ever made.,5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0

I just stop because it is time to go home from work.  I like the physical switch to turn them on and to set pairing mode. There is no holding down a button for a certain amount of time etc for that.tl;dr: Overall pretty decent for the price.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

They aren't perfectly noise canceling, but they still work very well. I am very happy with the quality. They also are great for the gym and stay on while running on the treadmill, which I was very surprised about. Perfect for studying as well, I use these while I read and while I do homework to block out everything.

"Just want to preface this by saying that I never write reviews, but I really felt the need to write one here.  I bought my first pair of Cowin's about 2 years ago and have been using them pretty religiously at my job every day.  I've worn these things on airplanes, car trips, you name it.  The noise cancellation isn't as good as a Bose, but it definitely gets the job done.  Even on an airplane it cancels most of the sound AND I can actually hear my music, which is way more than I can say for my old $20 headphones.  The sound quality is also very very good, and they're amazingly comfortable to wear.It was only last week that my headphones started to fall apart after 2 years of constant use and abuse.  Even after they fell apart I felt like buying another pair of Cowin's was the only way to go, and I can safely say that I have no regrets about it.  For the price, they're really amazing headphones.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0

Other than that, I'm super please with this!",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
I bought these headphones for a long flight and they worked exactly as described.  There were several very noisy passengers on the flight and I put my headphones and turned the active noise canceling one and enjoyed a wonderful flight.  The aux cable worked well with the in-flight entertainment system. The headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality was great.  I will definitely make these a permanent part of my travel gear.  I used the microphone feature and it worked quite well and the caller had no problems hearing me.  These are definitely a great deal for the price.,5,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
I am very impressed and extremely satisfied with these! I purchased them for listening to meditation at bedtime. My house is full of people and I have trouble falling asleep if i hear any activity in the next room. The noise is cancelled pretty well. There are times where i can hear the tv if my fiance has it on in the bedroom. But only faint sounds. The volume is not real loud on these but good enough for what i need. I went from using Beats to using these and have no complaints! The charging port broke in my beats so i needed something to replace them with. They are perfect for me. Very comfortable.,5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
"On first appearance these headphones look nice. I wasn't sure based on the pictures if it would look cheap or not. After receiving them, I can say they do not. They are well padded and seem to be easily adjustable. They aren't lightweight but I can't say they are too heavy either. After a quick charge, based on the recommendations from the instructions I gave them a try. The sound was better than expected for the cost. No, you aren't purchasing Bose headphones but your are most certainly getting equal or better quality to Beats. As far as the noise cancelling goes, I am more than satisfied. I gave them a try while mowing the lawn and they did not disappoint. I have had them for only a short time so I can't speak for the overall lifetime of the battery but I will say that since their initial charge, with regular use (3-4 hours/day) I have not required a charge in nearly 2 weeks. I'm impressed with the battery. I would recommend this product.Battery Life",5,1,2017-5-30,1,0,0
"Didn’t last too long had to throw them away about a week ago. Got this as a simple gift for my dad, I guess I should go with some higher end brands instead. Really disappointed since my dad used this practically every day, and always took care of it.Update 11/25/19",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I was previously dissatisfied with my purchase and left a review that reflected as such. The company reached out to me directly and offered me 3 solutions to how to best remedy the situation and I currently have a replacement set on the way, as I do believe there is a malfunction with the set i recieved. Im really happy they take pride in their product and offer to make things right. Thanks!",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I was very disappointed with its noise cancellation feature.  Basically, it is not different from a regular headset.  I had to return it.  The customer support contacted me and explained the difference between several COWIN similar products.  The customer support is very knowledgeable about and helpful.  I am very impressed by COWIN's product design.  I was able to try an E8 headset for comparison in noise-canceling capability.  The E8 performed much better than E7.  Compared to other high-cost product, it does provide an alternative option.  So I give it 4 stars.",4,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"I am very impressed with these headphones. Out of the box they look great. I turned them on and hooked my music to them and the sound quality was outstanding. They are very comfortable even wearing glasses! I would recommend these to anyone . great sound comfortable and doesn't break the bank. Also registered these E7 headphones and now have 24 months warranty. The company stands behind their product. I have used them on my riding mower, it is great to hear the music and not the noise of the mower. Would highly recommend to anyone that wants great sound.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"Packaging was good.  Survived transportation system.Sound was good.  Noise cancellation was good enough that I never heard my phone ringing on my desk.  Blocked background white noise.  Nearby conversations, not as much.",4,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
"I am very pleased with these headphones. They are comfortable, the sound quality is great and the freedom to move around while enjoying my music provided by the Bluetooth connectivity is awesome.

I needed a set of headphones that would connect to my older laptop through a Bluetooth adapter. These headphones paired with the Bluetooth adapter with no problems.  The headset materials are more comfortable than Bose or Sony. The sound is awesome. Better bass response and the high notes are clear and crisp. I can wear these phones for hours and not experience any discomfort.  These are great phones and I will purchase a second set for my wife. Even my co-workers think the sound is great.,5,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
I have used the headset for a few days now and tried the full range of its capabilities.  Here's the breakdown of my impressions.Pros:,4,1,2016-8-16,1,9,0
"It's not quite perfect with noise cancellation, but for the price it's pretty darn close. This also seems to have the longest battery life of any Bluetooth headset I've ever owned. Unfortunately that also means it has the longest charge time of any Bluetooth headset I've ever owned at about 4 hours. Still, I could imagine going all day using this headset and then just recharging it overnight.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Same as the top negative review, my right ear cup became detached after not much use. I have had these for 2 months total. I was randomly listening to my music when suddenly it felt like I had no ear cup- and lo' and behold! I managed to get it to somewhat fit back on my head with some properly placed duct tape, but I will not be getting another pair of these.Before this, the sound quality was great, worth the price, and I had no complaints. I did not expect the noise cancellation to work that well (and it didn't) but at this price I didn't expect much. I would rather get a cheap $5 with horrid sound quality that lasts me more than 2 months, though.",1,1,2019-10-19,1,1,0
"The headphones do a good job. They have great battery life and good range. They are a bit on the cheaper side, but they are not a cheap product that breaks down quickly. 2 months of constant airport traveling confirms this.The only down sides are the buttons say + and - for volume but on iPad they don't adjust volume and skip/tracks instead. They do not show the battery life when connected to my iPad so battery life seems to be a guess.  These are not serious downsides by any means that would prevent me from saying don't buy them.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,1,0
"They shouldn't have it say ""with microphone"" in the description if there isn't a microphone. I wanted this so I could use party chat with my friends on ps4, but I was misled by the description of the item.Edit: Okay, so I guess there is a microphone, it just does not work. The sound quality is great though and they last for a long time. If you just want wireless headphones, these are great. If you want a headset, look elsewhere.",4,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"I originally bought them for the *active* noise-cancelling mode for my roommate, who wants to listen to music while she mows the lawn, but she broke her wrist shortly after they arrived, so we have't been able to test out that feature just yet.Pros: These are comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours and they help me to focus on work in a house with six dogs. The clarity of sound seems good to me, but I am a layperson when it comes to acoustics. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase for my purposes and at this price point.",4,1,2017-8-8,1,0,0
I'm an electronic technician who has built and repaired speaker systems for over 40 years.I bought this set of headphones to replace the small earbud style which is very popular but won't stay in my ears. The price was low compared to the quality of the headset.,4,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"They're fine without active noise-cancelling, but mine are clearly defective—the noise cancelling always makes a high-pitched, vibrating noise that cycles to a high point and restarts, like two sound waves are slightly offset. If you're standing next to construction it's not a problem, it's not too loud, but I bought these for working in a fairly quiet environment and it's as loud as the music I listen to.",1,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"I have a Bose wired noise-canceling headset that is very good, costing more than $300. But there are times when the wire gets in the way, like on the treadmill. I also wanted a lower cost wireless set with the noise-canceling feature. I liked the reviews of the Cowin E7 and now share my agreement with a 5 Star review. The headset is comfortable, the sound quality very good and I was impressed with the noise-canceling. First I tested the noise-canceling at a party in a reception hall with a DJ, which always blasts the music. It was a great improvement, particularly the heart-pounding lower registers. I then used it on a plane. It did a very good job there too. I am very pleased with both the quality and the price, a fraction of the Bose.",5,1,2018-1-28,1,0,0
"I originally purchased these headphones over 2 years ago, and they are still going strong.  I use them at work every day, and the sound quality is still great.  I just purchased a second one for my son, since he was looking for headphones, and couldn't justify spending the money on a pair of Bose for a 13 year old.The build quality is excellent and has held up over two users.  Although primarily used in the office, I have taken them on a dozen trips and everything is still intact.  The headphones were much heavier than any other pair I have owned, so for the first few months I did notice a bit of strain from it, but do not even notice it anymore.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"Updated review:  Excellent customer service.  Received a new pair of Cowin E7s and they sound great.  There is a small difference in tone when using noise cancelling but not drastic as first pair.  Easy to set up Bluetooth and long battery life coupled with comfort and good sound quality for under $100 is surprising.  Plenty of bass and clear vocals.  Seem built well, a little heavy but not a problem as the ear cushions and head-strap are comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time. Satisfied with purchase and would buy again.  If they continue to perform I plan to buy a pair each of my three adult children as Christmas gifts.  Just what I was hoping for in quality and price.Original review:  Owned for one month. Great sound if noise cancellation is off.  Noise cancellation only works while using Bluetooth (not stated in manual).  For the price they sound very nice if noise cancellation is not used. When switched to noise cancellation mode the volume decreases and bass cuts out and sound quality suffers. The ear cups are comfortable and the cushioning blocks much ""noise"" but there is no difference in noise with cancellation on or off.  Still, for under $100 the E7 do sound great in normal mode using Bluetooth.  They feel well made and have excellent battery life. If noise cancellation worked better I would give 5 stars.",5,1,2017-8-15,1,0,0
"They sound great. I have zero complaints about the sound quality of these headphones. I only wish they were louder — which could be a consequence of the fact that they sound so great. My main purpose in ordering them was to have something to wear while mowing the lawn. The noise canceling performed admirably in that regard. But, given my druthers, they’d be a little more powerful when a favorite song came on and I felt the need to crank things up a bit.Still, for listening in less challenging circumstances, I’m very happy with them. They’re definitely keepers. Just a little less impedance would do the trick!",4,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"I had been trying some smaller Bluetooth headphones and was disappointed by the sound even from some expensive brands.  So my expectations weren't very high for these $60 headphones.  Boy was I surprised.  These are very comfortable and the sound is great.  Good base.  They probably aren't going to out perform the high-cost Bose and Sony, but for the price difference, it was a no-brainer.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"Running an air filter in my bedroom is better at cancelling out noises.  I realized with them being $50 headphones that you can only expect so much from them.  So get a different pair with better sound quality that doesn't claim to have the noise cancelling feature!!!  Also, when I turned on that feature, the headphones made a humming and pulsating noise.  I thought it was pulsatile tinnitus for a moment.  It even distracts from the music, unless maybe you're listening to it at 100dB and at that point, you're pretty much going to cancel everything out anyway.",1,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones as a necessity. My wife and I had to share an office at home and it was crazy having to hear each others meetings and conversations. I was expecting to block all the noise my wife does while talking and it worked! These headphones put me in my own bubble. Noise cancellations are quite effective, of course, it won't 100% block the noise, but I'd say a fairly 80%, which is fine with me. The Bluetooth connection works pretty well as far as a 8 to 10 meters of distance more or less and it keeps the connection very stable, no cutoffs. The sound quality is excellent and I actually prefer it when watching movies. The battery lasts long, I can use it for two consecutive days without charging it. Sometimes I forget to turn it off and surprisingly it lasts longer when I use them again. Very happy with this purchase and I would definitely consider another COWIN product in the future.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
UPDATED - I had an issue where the headphones stopped working.  I contacted the company and they tried to walk me through a few fixes but none worked.  They immediately sent out a replacement.  GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!I was amazed at the quality of these headphones.  I have owned other headphones that cost 4x more than these headphones and the quality and sound is similar.  I won't pay the higher prices any longer.  The noise-canceling feature worked wonderfully and the sound quality is amazing.  Music sounds amazing on these headphones.  I highly recommend.,5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"I’ve gotta say....I was presently surprised by these headphones. Purchased on Prime week, was a great price and rated great also. Put them on, turned it up while flying last week and boy, I was the best surprise all year! Quality was unbelievable, comfortable, the noise cancelling worked so well I forgot I was on a noisy plane. I’ve got a pair of Bose (very overrated) and expensive$$$ and a pair of Sennheiser that are great but older and worn-out. The wireless worked flawless and never ran out of battery.I’ll be buying again. A+",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
"These are fantastically comfortable, and have good sound quality.  The noise cancelling works great too.  Battery life is excellent: I used this on multiple flights over the last couple of weeks and it's still at more than half battery capacity.I think for the price, these are really just hard to beat if you don't like earbuds, or want a bit more physical noise isolation.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"I don't know if I got a bad set of these headphones, but the sound keeps cutting out and the volume controls do not always work.  They have been this way since I got them.  It's as if there is bad wiring in the housing of these headphones.  Definitely not worth the $60 price tag.  I am hoping these are not too late to return.  I will probably send Cowin's customer service a message, see what they say.",1,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"I originally got these for my digital keyboard.. I live in apartments, and play with headphones so I don't disrupt my neighbors. I was looking for something affordable and these are it! They work out fine with the piano, although the sound in the lowest and highest octaves the quality is iffy. I can't play for very long before getting a headache.I don't think these headphones were meant for that anyways",4,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"Somewhat better sir but still not there yet. Still needs to have a more decibel added to really bring up the volume. Now remember we are talking about the Hearing Impaired such as myself, so for now I'll still keep turning up the volume on my TV. They are great headphones for people with normal hearing, but again they need just a little improvement for the hearing Impaired such as myself.But I do appreciate your work and effort to try and make your product better, what do you want me to do with the head phones??",4,1,2017-6-12,1,1,0
"I have tried several ear buds over the years, but none of the would ever stay in my ears as long as I would have liked. So, I decided to try more traditional over-ear headphones. I could not be happier with my choice of the Cowin E7 headphones! The headphones are very comfortable, the noise cancellation is good (for the price), the sound quality is great, and the battery life is good. I have worn my headphones outside while weed wacking, and I could perfectly hear my audiobook. If you are in the market for a great set of headphones without spending a mint, please consider the the Cowin E7 headphones!!",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"Overall I really liked these headphones while they lasted, good battery life, comfortable on my head (even with glasses) and they looked pretty good. But recently an internal tiny rotation component that attaches the ear cup to the headband broke for seemingly no reason. I rarely used these outside of sitting in an office or going for a walk, and the component broke while gently taking them off my head. They lasted for a little over a year, which for 60 dollars I would hope to have been two years. I understand that these aren't meant to be the fanciest headphones, but I was severely disappointed that they only lasted this long and think that they are overpriced for their durability factor.",3,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0

"OK, I was given a new Samsung TV for Christmas. After a couple of weeks I decided to get BT wireless headphones.  Searching the Amazon products and reading reviews I chose these Cowin E7's. Received them 3 days ago and couldn't be happier!!  Great quality, very comfortable.  Within an hour I had them hooked up to the tv, my cell phone and my Kindle Fire tablet. No sweat!! I was so happy that I let my wife try them, she love them. I ordered another set for her, they showed up today and I've got them hooked up to her tv, computer and Kindle Fire. 2 sets of Cowin E7's in 3 days and everyone here is very happy!

I purchased as a gift but had to check them out for sound and operation. I was impressed with look and feel of the phones . They were easy to connect with both my iPhone and laptop. They never felt too tight. The sound is very good and spatial quality was also good. This is probably a perfect pair for my daughter. I found them a little too bassy for my liking but clear sounding anyway.,4,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I looked long and hard for some good quality headphones that cancel out other noise and still keeps a good sound and bass. These headphones deliver. They are great for the price with great quality sound, bass and decent sound cancelling. I use them while mowing the lawn, the headphones do well at softening the loud mower so I can enjoy my music. My only real complaint is the silver/metal parts, they are still plastic and after awhile they started looking not so shiny. But that's a small issue really. Overall I love these headphones.",4,1,2019-5-26,1,0,0
"These headphones are probably one of the best noise cancelling sets I've had. They're not heavy, the cushions are really soft, and the look is simple. It's snug, but not confining. The quality of sound is smooth, the bass is nice, and you really don't need the volume to be more than 50% at most. I probably have mine set at 30-35%. It did take a bit of adjusting but, after about 15 minutes or so, my ears got used to it. The rotating factor is also handy. If, after a while your ears are a little squished, you can hang them around your neck and they lay flat on your chest, whether you're lying down or sitting up.Overall, really great product. I'd definitely recommend these headphones. Also, it comes with a bag, and an aux cord to connect when bluetooth is unavailable or if they aren't charged.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I purchased this pair for my son and didn't want to spend top dollar for it. I tried these mainly to test how comfortable these were. Have had this for almost 2 weeks now, these are comfortable for the short to medium duration I have had these on. The sound quality is very good, clear vocals with decent bass. Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze, connects automatically as soon as these are turned on to the last paired device. What I absolutely love about this product is battery life. I started using it right out of the box and havent had to charge these yet. The sound quality is slightly better without NC. It comes with a 3.5mm aux cable which is convenient, and a usb cable to charge. Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the case, which is not a hard case but a pouch and seems to be just the right size but, in my opinion, could be fractionally bigger. Very hard to beat these at this price point for sound quality, connectivity and comfort.",4,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"The Cowin E7 is the first wireless over the ear noise cancelling headset that I have purchased.  So far I'm am very happy with my purchase.  I use them at home in the house so the noise isn't that bad, but the noise cancelling does seem to work very well.  The battery life is quite good.  I can get at least 20 hours of use on a charge keeping in mind that the environment that I typically use these in isn't overly load so I don't use the noise cancelling setting all that much.  Sound quality is pretty good.  This is a great noise cancelling headset for the price.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
Was on the fence between these and the JBLs that were the same price but these had better reviews so I went with these and I’m glad I did. These sit over the ear and not on the ear like the JBLs would have. The bass is great. Sound quality is prob a 7.5 out of 10 which for the price is good. I never play them at full capacity because they drown out the noise around the house at around 75-80% volume level. As far as the noise cancellation goes it’s COOL but not much of a difference I normally leave it on BT mode. But either way it’s dope. These are plastic a glossy plastic but looks great. These are my second noise cancellation headphones so eh I’m  not oblivious to what it should be.  Had bose before but they weren’t this comfortable tbhComfortability: 8,4,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0
"I was under the impression that ALL noise would be blocked using the noise cancellation feature. While much of the ambient noise is blocked or dulled, you can still hear moderate level talking and louder noises. Which would be good in case of an emergency.  I need complete silence to stay focused to write papers. These have helped a great deal in lessening the many distractions. I have no issue with the White noise the noise cancellation produces. However, I let two coworkers try them and they said it made them feel dizzy. The quality and comfort of the headphones are amazing! Especially around the ears! I purchased a second pair for a Christmas gift, and the headphones are now permanently attached to the child's head!",4,1,2019-2-3,1,0,0
"I have two uses for these headphones. First and most frequently lawn mowing and snow blowing.  I've used them once on the mower and they were fine.  Snow blowing has not yet been necessary.  I also will need them for air travel.  That will happen in another month.  Right now I'm using them with an I pod as I type this review,  Madame Butterfly sounds WONDERFUL.  They are inexpensive enough that I'm willing to use them in all the above situations without worrying about their exposure to the real world.  Durability cannot yet be determined.  From what I've read and experienced noise cancellation is mostly effective for machine and engine noise.",4,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"**The best deal out there at this price point**.  Easy to pair, great sound and long battery life. The wife borrowed them today while cleaning the house and doing laundry.[looks like I may be buying another set soon, for me] I use these at night to watch TV so not to disturb the wife.. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.The A.N.C. function is remarkable. When on, I only hear the sounds on this headset. It blocks ambient noise and lets the program come through very clear.  So bottom line is, this is a well built stereo headset, great price.

"These are just an okay set of  low price head phones. The battery life is good.

I love these headphones!!! I've never had bluetooth headphones - what a luxury! I can listen to my favorite playlists without getting tangled up in wires. The sound quality is just as good as the $300 corded headphones I've had for years. You can even use them to talk on a cellphone (although I haven't used that functionality yet).

"Sound quality is good and ANC is only so-so.After a while of very light usage I started to realize that the ANC started to make funny sounds.

It also makes “chirp” like sounds when you move them around.",2,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
As far as I'm concerned the sound quality is good. Since it is wireless it makes it easier to use when on-the-go or lying in bed listening to music. Don't have to get tangled with wires/cords. I often listen to music when on the computer so it was disappointing when I could not pair with my computer.  I also experienced a hissing sound when the headset is in the noise cancelling mode. I think it a good value!  I don't think I would be able to discern a noticeable sound difference between the Cowin E7 and a headset costing $200-$300 more.,4,1,2019-5-31,1,1,0
"This is my second pair of E7 noise cancelling headphones. The first set finally started showing wear after a few years of heavy use. I frequently wear them around the job site because I figured they would be more enjoyable than standard ear protection, and they have stood up very well to a lot of use. I finally opted to buy another pair so that I could have a set that looked nice for when I was not on the job site.I have a good friend who has lots of different noise-cancelling headphones, including much pricier name-brands like Bose and Beats. Honestly, neither one of us can tell the difference between those brands and the E7 (except when it comes to price). These deliver a much better quality sound than ear buds or cheap headphones, and I'm buying for quality, not for a status symbol. I think it is a great value for the money!",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"Small heads beware. As noted in the title, these aren’t terrible but my head is too small for them. If you are someone that has to get youth hats to have a hat fit properly, I wouldn’t recommend these. They would slide down my head if I moved too much and the noise canceling doesn’t work well.

Battery life seriously last for weeks as long as you turn it off after using it. Noise cancelling is good for what it is (i have nothing to compare it to but for what i've experienced, it works good enough). Sound quality is great. If I have any cons, it would be the bass.

Only one suggestion for manufacturers, the case was a nice bonus and I’m sure costs you extra to supply.  So it seems that if you were going to the trouble, you would supply a case that was actually large enough for the headphone.  The headphones fit in the case but it is too small to actually close the case with the drawstring, rendering it not very useful.  Please consider a modification of the case size.",5,1,2018-5-4,1,0,1
"I always bought ~20$ headphones, until I finally decided to buy something more expensive. I didn;t know where to start and then sudddenly those popped up in my search. I read some reviews and ordered. Believe me you will not regret buying those earphones. The sound is amazing, the noize cancelation is good, the battery is stromg. The are easy to handle, connecting to phone immediately. I wvwn watch movies with them since the sound is better than in my pc speakers.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,1,0

This is my second pair of these headphones.  I am not a music person but I wanted a quality pair of noise cancelling headphones.  I liked this pair enough that I bought a second pair for my wife and she was surprised at the quality.  The battery life is great.  We took them on our recent trip to Italy and the battery lasted longer than the duration of the flights.  The sound quality is great and the bass is very good.  The noise cancelling feature was a lifesaver on the plane and I use them at work every day.  They are comfortable and don't weigh very much.  My ears did start to hurt a little after wearing them for the 10 hour flight.,5,1,2019-5-31,1,0,0
1.Appearance - Clean and attractive. I’ve been asked about my headset on multiple flights. The end question is the case. Each and myself would prefer and included hard case.2. Sound quality - No complaints. My flights are literally more relaxing not hearing the flight sounds. And I could hear the movies without having to cover my ears. I listen at low volume and the sound quality is still good.,5,1,2018-8-2,1,0,0

"I've had these headphones for a couple of months now, and I have basically no complaints.  The battery life is incredible, I charge them maybe once a week.  I mostly use them at work to tune out the machinery noise around me.  The bluetooth range is about 90 feet, which means I can leave my phone on the charger and wander away while still listening to music.One small complaint is the bluetooth will cut out occasionally, but only for a second or so.  Other than that, they're comfortable, sound good and have great range.",4,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"Update: the company reached out to me based on my review and are sending me an upgraded headphone.

"I'm very happy with this purchase. The headphones are very comfortable, and I have no problem wearing them for several hours at a time. The sound is a good quality with decent bass, about what I expected from a $50 set of headphones. Noise cancellation is good, mostly covering lower pitch noises, people talking still comes through but slightly muffled. Its very quick and easy to pair them over bluetooth. I also really like that they come with a headphone jack so you can still plug them into a computer or laptop to get sound without having to pair. Overall, these are a great purchase for anyone looking for middle of the line over ear headphones.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"This product looks and feels nice. You can wear them for long periods of time with no discomfort. However, the Noice Cancellation (""NC"") is less than poor, sound quality is average and there is no bass to it. I bought them specifically for the NC and am very disappointed on how much they do not cancel out. This product is like a big pear of expensive ear muffs nothing more.",2,1,2019-7-6,1,1,0
These sound like you are sitting in a tin can. My son said that they are worse than the ones that are used in middle school. The noise cancelling is fine but the echo is so horribly distracting that they are unusable.,1,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
"I think these are great so far, sound good, look decent, pretty comfortable for over the ear, even with glasses (which is an issue with other headphones) easy to pair. They will be excellent for the officeBut I have to say they smell horribly like spray paint/chemicals.

Not sure why but it could be off-putting or migraine inducing to those sensitive.",4,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
"Used on a recent trip, four flights total.  The noise-cancelling feature does definitely detract from the sound quality when enabled as it makes a ""tin can"" sound that others have referenced.  However, this is much preferable to the loudness of being on an airplane.  When enabled I really couldn't hear any of the normal plane noise and just my music.If not flying, use them in regular mode and I think they sound great.  I'm no audiophile, but for this price point, I'll recommend them to anyone.  Volume, skip songs, pause, all with a simple button.  Bluetooth pairing worked immediately too on two different devices and never tried the wired connection.",5,1,2017-2-3,1,1,0
"The headphones worked well with my new Motorola G6 phone, but I bought them to use with my 4-year old TV.  Strangely, per Cowin customer service, the Samsung TV must have BlueTooth 5 and the headphones have BlueTooth 4, and the TV must not be backward compatible.  Cowin Customer service patiently worked through the diagnosis, so no complaints there.  The only fix they could offer was buying more expensive Cowin headphones.",3,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"For the price, these headphones are pretty slick. The noise-canceling doesn’t really “cancel” unless you’re playing music. If you’re looking for a pair for the additional feature of audio isolation, look elsewhere.HOWEVER: if you’re looking for a way to tune everyone else out and home in on your groove, grab a pair of these headphones. You’ll be plunged into the sound, as each note and chord is played as if you had the band right next to you, and you’ll be rocking out to the guitar solos in just enough time for your coworkers to look at you like you’re some kind of alien goofball, which in no way happened to the reviewer.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Bought these for my 11 yo son. They are quite adequate for him being that they look cool (chrome looks make them look more expensive than they are) and have enough functionality for his use cases. He uses these headphones via bluetooth with his tablet and wired with his X-box 360. In the latter, the sounds you are able to perceive are beyond what the TV plays alone, so it's an upgrade for sure.However, if these headphones were for me, I'd be slightly underwhelmed. The sound quality is just OK when I compare to my (late) on-ear Sennheisers and my earbud Audio Technica. Noise cancelling is less effective than high-end brands like Bose's offerings. Also, I cannot understand why the volume and skip controls only work when in bluetooth and not when using the Aux cable; that's unnecessary over-engineering... or perhaps a defect? All in all, these are fine headphones for someone who is not comparing against top-shelf brands.",4,1,2017-6-8,1,1,0
Well I gave it 3 stars because the quality is of material is no that bad but they look acceptable one thing I really did not like it was how they smell like a shoes glue but strong .......the noise canceling works but no how I expectedI not for the price I have to say they are OK.....remember if you really want a good quality headphones will cost you more then 100 dollars,3,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0

"I purchased this product in advance of airplane travel (in 2019) as a major upgrade from the earbuds I had been using. The battery charge for the bluetooth lasts a long time, and they recharge pretty quickly. I really enjoy the sound quality, noise cancellation and option of bluetooth or a standard headphone jack, which allowed me to pair with my own devices or to plug in and watch the in-flight movies. I like that the earpieces rotate for flatter storage, but will likely still get the hard-sided case rather than just using the bag that they come with. Since being home, I frequently wear them around the house, not having to worry about minding cords while listening to something and can avoid bothering or being bothered by my roommate while we're working.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0

"I just got these in and they look good They actually give you a nice bag inside the package with all the cables and such, but I found that the ear cuffs are a tad small.

Granted, they're BT, so a good replacement for them. I'd prefer that the music controls had been on different buttons as I figured out that in order to change volume I must Hold the button down.

"I was initially disappointed by the audio quality of this headset but the folks at Cowin reached out to me and provided a brand new and improved set free of charge. I have to say right away i did notice a big improvement with the active noise cancelation. It just works better. While the audio presentation is slightly better this time, its still not as loud and enveloping as i would like. Bass is still fairly weak unfortunately.

"Excellent headphones for this price point.  Good sound quality.  I purposely was looking for under $100 price point with some specific features such as noise canceling and ability to listen via wired headphone jack.  My phone has a HiFi Quad DAC built in and listening via a corded headphone jack is phenomenal. What I did not realize is that the headphones have to be turned on, meaning the bluetooth radio in the headphones is always on, even though you are not connected via bluetooth, but rather the wired jack.The other thing I did not realize is that you cannot control your music player via the headphone buttons when listening via the wired jack, even though the headphones are turned on.  Player controls only work when connected via bluetooth, not the wire.  Not a deal breaker, however.",4,1,2018-3-6,1,0,0
I work all day in a giant data center so comfort and drowning out the background noise are important.  But that’s really all these do well.  The sound and microphone quality is poor.

Great for listening to things but terrible for talking to people- they struggle significantly to hear me unless I plug in a mouth piece from an old set of headphones I had. Controls on the device itself work well and easily. Lightweight and don't vice grip the head- comfortable. Battery lasts for a long time. Bass is unimpressive. Seriously disappointed with the poor conversational quality of these headphones.,3,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
Love my headphones. They were easy to pair to my Yamaha receiver. They fit very comfortably and are easy to operate. The sound quality is great but I get a little lad in the voice streaming. I love the noise canceling feature. I would purchase them again. I would give them five stars if it were not for the slight voice lag which could be contributed to my receiver. I highly recommend the Cowin E7.,4,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"The headphones are comfortable.  I have worn them over 3 hours in one sitting without any discomfort.  The audio quality is clear, the bass is deep.  The price was great!  I ended up purchasing an audio aux cable with a mic because audio was a little too low for phone calls.  That fully resolved the problem.  I think this is typical of bluetooth audio.  I suspect that the mic is tuned for noise cancellation rather than phone calls.",4,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0

I have cartilage piercings and worried they might make the headphones uncomfortable but they didn't at all.

They do a great job of drowning out outside noises, even without using the noise cancellation. My ears ring a lot and that sometimes interferes with trying to fall asleep.

The biggest negative is that it is required for the headphones to be turned on for use even when using the included cable or any other audio cable. Therefore, these headphones cannot be used if the battery is low, and using them plugged in still drains battery. The only other issues are that the on-board volume/switching controls aren't very good, and Cowin is a Chinese company or at least part of the company is in China, so the directions for the product and other interactions with the company sometimes have broken English. I do have worries as to the longevity of the product as I have a rather big head and other reviews state the product may be prone to breaking. I will be sure to update if anything changes. Overall, the Cowin E7's seem to be a great pair of affordable Bluetooth headphones, with decent battery life, decent audio quality, and great pricing.",4,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"Overall, these headphones are great. They're comfortable for long periods of time, the noise cancelling is more than what I expected for the price, and they sound pretty good. The battery life is amazing as well. If you're looking for bluetooth noise cancelling headphones without paying hundreds of dollars, these are the ones for you.There are a couple minor issues. The first and most significant issue is that while it's charging and in noise cancelling mode, there's a constant buzzing in one ear. It's loud enough to be distracting, and it means that I have to take my headphones off (or turn off noise cancelling) when I need to charge them. Another issue is that when switching active noise cancelling off, the sound quality changes noticeably. It might be just a psychological effect, but it's there nonetheless. Finally, there's no way to turn on noise cancelling only. If you want the noise cancelling, you have to also turn on bluetooth. I had my headphones on while in a plane once and someone else connected to my headphones and played their music. If there were a noise cancelling only option on the control switch, that would improve these headphones significantly.",4,1,2018-4-29,1,0,0
"I've never had real headphones before, but these are amazing for their price point!  I always struggled to find ear bugs that fit comfortably.  And after moving to an open floor plan office, i needed something to block put the noise around me.  These headphones are perfect.  Sometimes I still hear noise, but not often.  I've even had people try to get my attention and I can't hear them.  Good enough for me!  Didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars.  Would definitely recommend.",4,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"Very attractive packaging, and design of the headphones themselves! Overall, I would recommend as the most bang for the buck! The only down side I have, is the volume control seems backward to me; you have to press the lower part of the control to raise the volume, and the upper part to lower the volume.  But that is no deal breaker for me, I'll just get used to it! I use this for listening to the TV and music.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
This product is a great buy for the money.  The unit and the sound quality is excellent.  I recently had a problem with my headphones and I contacted the company to try and them fixed.  Their customer service team is fantastic.  Summer took care of my problem immediately and said they were shipping out a new pair to me.  I’m very impressed and will recommend these headphone to all of my friends.  Thank you Cowin!!!,5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"These seem like decent headphones, especially for the price, but they were about half an inch short of being able to comfortably cover my ears. I have a large head but not like in a medically concerning way. I have Bose and Sony that both fit fine, so be aware these run slightly on the small side.",2,1,2019-12-8,1,2,0
"The headphones look very professional and I had high hopes for them.BUT they did not work at all with Bluetooth, and were unreliable as plug-in and worked only a couple of times. I will stay with Sony earbuds, which have fantastic sound quality and indeed are sound-canceling! To boot, I can carry them in my pocket!",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"These are great. They sound awesome and the noise cancellation is astounding. I bought these to replace a $400 pair of Bose that I lost, and I would have to say these are just about as good. And the Bose were not even wireless. I was going to return them because they don't work well at the gym, which is what I bought them for. I lost the bows before I needed these, and lamented not having them for my workouts. It turns out I sweat too much for these types of headphones to be comfortable. However, they sound so good I kept them for doing jobs where noise is a real and sometimes dangerous issue, like mowing the lawn, using the snow blower, and of course flying. I bought a great pair of wireless earbuds for the gym but I am also very happy with.",5,1,2017-11-12,1,0,0
"Headphones feel cheap, which maybe should've been expected given the price.  Very flimsy feeling.  I have no idea why tech companies continue to use a glossy finish that shows every fingerprint and immediately looks dirty.  The sound quality is average at best, but the noise cancelling is pretty pathetic.  I sent them back almost immediately.",2,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
"Considering the price, these headphones are exceptional.  While the models that cost five times the price may be better, they are nowhere near to five times better.  These work flawlessly while I am writing during the day and need to escape the noise in my residence.  I can barely hear myself speak!  The sound quality is not that of the studio reference quality produced by the big models, but they are still a great choice if you don't have $250+ to blow.",4,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Just bought these headphones for the second time. I first got them nearly two years ago and they had since survived everyday abuse and air travel until yesterday when one of the sides suddenly snapped. I think they have great noise quality and hold a good charge. The noise cancelling could be better, but it does block out a lot. Overall, these are the cheaper of the expensive headphones and I thought they were worth it enough to buy again.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I found these noise cancelling headphones at fair value. The noise canceling properties are excellent, but when listening to music the noise cancelling mode is very Basie and the normal mode is fairly sharp. It would be nice to have something in between. They are very comfortable but if you have very large ears they're not going to fit inside of these pads. If you are just going to use these say, on a flight to getting cabin noise they would work perfect.",4,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"My wife purchased these for me and the first thing I did was charge them and began using them.  I was impressed. it took me about a week to finally drain these head phones.  The Sound quality is very good, and the build quality is excellent.  I have to say my wife chose a very good product.  I would recommend these to any one, who is looking for an excellent sound and quality product for an excellent price.  When the time comes to replace these I will definitely look at Corwin again.",5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,1
"These are extremely comfortable and are good for long listens.  The foam on the head feels like leather and is very soft and cushy.  The ear pads are very soft, but not sure how long it will be before they rip, the outer layer seems a tad thin.  The sound is phenomenal for the price.  Good bass and just loud enough.  I like that the on/off is an actual switch and not a button, so it is very easy to tell if they are off, saving you battery life.  They do feel a little plasticy but look high quality.  I have only had these for a week and am not hard on my head phones, so I may give an update in a few months.",4,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
Headphones seem to be quality with good sound and easy bluetooth connectivity.  Not sure about the noise cancellation.  I use these in my wood shop and they muffle the sound of my machines but not at the level of the earplugs I used to use.  But I don't have a baseline to compare them to or how well other noise cancellation headphones. I think they will be adequate for my purposes.,4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"These headphones are wonderful, don't be fooled by the price. My son has autism, so headphones are important in daily life. He has another pair of the expensive Sony 350.00 Dollar ones and these ones are a close second. They hold a charge for a good 30 hrs, just like Sony and the Comfort is right up there. Got my husband the Anker brand and Cowin is much BETTER . Considering another pair !",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"Upfront you should know that these are made in China.  I was looking specifically for US products - this is a US company selling Chinese products.That said, the sound is decent, the mic is a bit canny when using Skype, Teams, or Zoom.  Good for what I wanted which is a $50.00 pair of headphones for teleconferences.",2,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0
"I like them.. in that they look cool and fit well, however as for noise canceling.. it doesn’t! That was my main appeal to these.. price was right PLUS I can listen to an Audible book, wo the distraction of my kids! I’m a single mom, trying to “get away” during this pandemic, through stories and music.. but it doesn’t even cancel out the ride mower noise.. I need to use my actual noise canceling ear protectors over my earbuds just to create the environment I was hoping that these would provide.",2,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0
"Sounds really good, bass is not amazing but decent. Noise cancellation is surprisingly good. The battery life is the best feature. I use it for days with out having to recharge it. I would say i use it an estimate of maybe 3 to 5 hours a day (Not every day), and charge it only once a week, maybe less (Only remember charging it 2 times in 3 months, but not sure).So I recommend it fully.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I first purchased a pair for myself, and I use them on a daily train commute. They're perfect for some relaxing peace and quiet on the long way to or from work. My wife liked them so much I ended up buying her a pair, which she uses while jogging. The Bluetooth/NFC connection is quick and reliable. The audio is good, and the noise cancelling very effective. (It does better with the regular train noise than random people talking, but still does a great job.)6 months in and the left ear on my wife's set stopped working. One e-mail got be replacement instructions and a couple of days later, she was back in business. VERY good customer service, and a great set of headphones.",5,1,2017-8-20,1,1,0

I am a professional drummer and my son also plays, so we were trying to not to spend $300+ on headphones to practice with and I rolled the dice and have been very pleased!  I also own a Marketing Firm and now they have been my go to on Video Conferencing!  They have a wonderful battery life and are super comfortable.  Connectivity has been with no issues, as well!",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"These headphones are a great alternative to all the bluetooth headphones that push $100-200. The sound quality is fair, and the comfort is great as well. The noise cancelation is pretty impressive; I used these on an airplane twice now, and the difference in noise when they are on vs. off is drastically impressive. A downside I have is when on the noise cancellation mode there is sensitivity to movement, as in if the headphones are bumped the audio makes a weird sound almost like bubbling in the headphone itself. The only other downside is purely cosmetic, but they are chunky. I've noticed other headphones such as beats, etc. are slim fitting to the head. These headphones almost look ridiculous with their bulk, but it isn't so bad that I wouldn't wear them in public. All in all, I definitely do not regret these headphones, especially for the price.",4,1,2018-6-13,1,0,0
"I ordered these for their noise canceling feature. I am enjoying the full bodied sound from the headphones. There is a hiss on the right side when using the noise canceling mode. I have done some research and find this to be common even among much more expensive headsets. I have not used them to fly yet and figure the hiss will probably not be as noticeable with the constant droning noise from the planes engines. I bought a usb Bluetooth adapter for one of my computers that didn't already have it available. The headphones connected to both of my computers as well as my iPhone and iPad without any issue. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,0
"For some background, I wanted a set of noise-reducing or noise-cancelling headphones for use in my knife shop. We're often using extremely loud power tools so I wanted a headset that would allow me to block out the extra noise while also piping some music through them.  I've used these pretty regularly for a couple of weeks now and I've got to say that overall these are a great buy for the price.  I'll rank the headphones below in more detail:1) Appearance: Nice appearance. Not the most stylish set you could buy but they certainly look high quality and aren't an eyesore.",4,1,2017-8-16,1,0,0
"Being a guy with a large head, and wearing glasses, it was hard finding a pair of headphones that would fit. I've tried earbuds, but I've had problems with them hurting my ears after extended use, so I browsed Amazon looking for a pair of headphones that would fit me, and after extensive searching I stumbled upon the Cowin E7 Active headphones. The user reviews for them were great, and seeing photos of them, they looked large, and even better was that they were Bluetooth, so no need for wires.I ordered them last week, and got them on Saturday and upon first taking them out the packaging which was nice might I add, I turned them on, synced them to my Chromebook, and tested them out. They fit like a glove, and unlike other headphones they weren't uncomfortable when I wore them with my glasses, a big plus for me.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,1
My old bluetooth headphones have now belong to my husband since he borrowed them and his scratchy beard ruined the padding. I decided I needed a new pair of bluetooth headphones around 1am as my infant was screaming. This was the budget pick on a list of best 2019 headphones and I couldn't be happier. Great battery life and quality! My husband's beard is not allowed near.,5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0

"Seriously such a good purchase! They're comfortable and have good sound. Great quality, really. The only thing is that they're a little loose on my head (but not enough to make the purchase not worth it. And my head is probably barely smaller than your average dudes head). Also, the left side won't stay up. Like if I pick them up by the top, it slides down to it's biggest setting for that side.They're very solid and look super good! Also, the noise cancelling functionality works extremely well. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2017-5-3,1,0,0
"These are Bose or Sony headphones, comparing them would be wrong. What you do get is a solid pair of comfortable, noise-canceling headphones for an amazing price.The sound is good, a little muddy on the vocals when ANC is enable, but more than acceptable for what I wanted.",4,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
"If you're going spend around $60 for headphones buy THESE:I rarely write reviews for purchases because they simply serve their purpose or if something is so bad I want to warn others so you can be assured that these are exceptional because: 1-The charge lasts forever, it's never gone dead and I wear them 14 hours straight sometimes. 2-Durability-I've dropped them and mishandled them and they are like new. 3-Longevity - I've only owned them 3 months but I can tell they will last at least a year, probably more. 4 - Comfort - Like I said, I wear them 14 hours straight and don't even realize I'm wearing them. I don't listen to bass-heavy music, but they seem as if they would perform as you would expect for $60. The only feature that is useless is the noise-cancelling. The sound degrades noticeably but listening to them on standard mode I don't hear anything unless it's super loud.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I'm blow away by how much I've spent for what I got. If you don't need super-duper-amazing noise cancelling ability, but rather something to dull the surround sound, this will work well for you. Plus, the design of the headphones is intuitive and comfortable. It's good UX design. And I haven't had to charge it once in 3 weeks, and I use it almost every day.They did a great job on this product, and the price is better than everything else in this category.",5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"Aside from my product not coming with a charger cable OR aux cable, I love my headphones. I wasn't about to send them back, so Amazon refunded me $15. I love being able to watch my shows on my iPad while hubby watches golf or nascar on the television. The noise cancelling helps, too! I can't attest to the sound quality because I'm deaf in one ear and don't hear in stereo, but I can say my deaf ear isn't receiving painful reverberations, which I was fearful of. All around, I'm delighted!!",5,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0
"These headphones dont come with their own dongle, and rely on bluetooth you have. Using my bluetooth plugin for the desktop PC the performance was terrible, range was nonexistant and required a restart every time I need to connect to these headphones. Sound was bad, which for no reason at all got WAY worse on discord. The only good thing about these headphones is the battery. Save your self a headache and buy the MPOW wireless headset like i did after refunding this, it comes with its own dongle and outperforms this one 100 times over.",1,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I was peer pressured into buying these by my boss. He loved them and suggested they would be great for traveling. They should issue these on airplanes for every passenger. I didn't hear babies, children, loud talkers, over-sharers, or anything else while on the plane. Works well in the office (at home) as well. Have not figured out a way to make them smaller so I can wear them during meetings, but I am hopeful...",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"I am amazed by the quality of these headphones. I am picky since I can’t wear the original iPhone type and the other ones usually press my ear too hard.These ones are amazing, probably would write a follow up review six month from now.",4,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"Received the headphones and immediate got them charged up. Instructions were good and no issues charging. Connected to iPhone first, sound quality was excellent. Use of volume buttons was easy. Noise cancelling worked great and was not intrusive. Next BT'd into my Onkyo stereo receiver. Again, sound quality was way better then the price point would suggest. The bass and trebled were very balanced. No boominess or shrillness was present. These are a very solid set of headphones and a great price. Highly recommend.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
So I just purchased them and I have to say I'm frustrated. I didn't really read the instructions at first so as soon as I opened the box and turned on the bluetooth it freaked me out as it was flashing colors so I switched it off. Fast forward after reading the instructions I realised I need that so I go to do it again. I cant only the NC works now and so I thought maybe its just dead so I charge them fully and try to turn on BT it doesn't work. Its so so frustrating to me and I'm just so disappointed today has been tough and I really didn't need to add a wasted 63 dollars to the list :/,2,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
They have a really good sound and fit comfortably.  The sound is clear and the fit helps filter out ambient noises.  There are two things that would make them perfect.  1.  automatic turning off after several minutes of non-use and 2. remembering the volume setting each time they are turned on.  I have to turn them down every time I use them.  Otherwise I love them.,4,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"I could list all the specs for these phones and tell you “yeah it’s all accurate” but you really just have to try em for yourself. 5/5 would absolutely recommend. Better than expected, and I had some high expectations putting these guys on. Definitely worth the money.Side note, I bought these specifically for mowing the lawn, as they are ANC, and they did not disappoint. Paired up with the magnetic beer holder I ordered as well, the ride is at least... 8x more enjoyable.",5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"These headphones use a certain special type of bluetooth so make sure your device supports that. It's a type of bluetooth where you physically touch a certain spot on the headphones to your device and then bluetooth connection occurs. The only problem is that spot, on these headphones, is in a recessed area so you cannot literally touch that spot to the device. As a result, my headphones will not pair. They're useless.",1,1,2018-12-21,1,1,0
"The only issue I have with these so far is trying to get used to the upside down controls. It's very weird that they put put the volume up button below the volume down button. It's been a month of using these and I'm still trying to rewire my brain to get used to it since every other wireless headphone I've ever used is opposite. I also think it would have been better to make the next song and previous song functions the long press instead. I'm constantly going back to the beginning of the current track when trying to raise the volume, which again, is the wrong button to be pressed to begin with. Other than that I'm happy with the sound quality.",3,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"These headphones were average and marketed as noise cancelling etc etc but they were average. What made me write a negative review, which I have only done once before, is that the headphones simply stopped taking a charge after only a few months.

"First, the presentation of the packaging and the headphones is quite impressive.  Next, the headphones are very easy to use and paired instantly with my Smartphone, so that any calls, apps, music etc. that i can play on my phone, can be received wirelessly to these headphones.

Fantastic sounds quality and really brings out the different instruments, vocals, and overall depth some songs have that can normally be lost or faintly heard due to low quality speakers. The noise cancelling is not the best but definitely works well enough when music is playing, the NFC is pretty convienient, and even with everyday use I hardly find myself charging instead of jamming. The plastic has a minor cheap feel about it but is durarble and reliable. The padding is very Comfortable and sometimes I forget they are on my head when lost in the music but, Unfortunately, they can get a tad warm Depending on the activity.",5,1,2019-2-6,1,1,0

One of the speakers blew out just a month after purchasing. The volume was quite loud, but it was only at about 75% and could've been turned up more on my device (iphone feeding into an electronic drum set to play along with songs). Update: Posted this review (originally 3 star), and within a day had received an email offering a replacement. Replacement headphones arrived within a few days.

My biggest disappointment however is I can't seem to get any job done before the headphone goes silent needing recharge.",3,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0

The noise cancelling feature works extremely well and the sound quality is very good for this price range, with a nice bass sound. Well balanced, not overpowering. They work very well for answering calls also, as I use my phone for the music source. Mic works well even in outside conditions. Taken them on lots of plane trips and are great for movies. They have held up extremely well over the years, no issues. The padding still looks like new, battery life is great, still in the area of 25 hours plus. Sound quality is still great.

"So far these headphones have been pretty solid. They have decent sound quality and bass, and the noise cancellation is a good plus. I was actually surprised at how good they sound and how well they work given the relatively small price tag. They work better than the $200 pair of Marshall wireless headphones, and those didn't even have noise cancel. If you're looking for a decent pair of wireless headphones and you're on a budget, congratulations, you have arrived at your destination.",5,1,2019-6-30,1,1,0
"I am surprised by the noise cancelation capability. I would rank NC 5 stars. The sound quality is OK. When I listen to classical music, seems the sound quality lacks something but I am no expert and could not pinpoint to which part is weak. Let me put it this way, in CD stores, the sound quality of the headphone for listening to sample track is better than this product. I am not music professional and this product is good enough to meet my needs: listening to lecture and music. So, in general, I rank this product 4 stars.",4,1,2019-8-8,1,1,0
I have had a ton of trouble trying to get these headphones to connect with my iPhone 8 and almost threw them away before I figured out the trick is after pairing you must go to Bluetooth settings and select the E7 device BEFORE turning on the headphones.  If you turn on the headphones first and then try to connect you are not going to get the headphones to connect.,4,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"I have had this thing for almost a year and it's been great. I got them just in time for my family vacation ie non-stop exposure to 3 siblings and they worked great. The batteries last forever, I charged up before the trip and didnt have to recharge it for several days. The sound cancelation is not very good unless you have something to listen to, then you could ignore anything. The only problem in a years testing is that sometimes it will act like it struggles to connect so like you might miss what that person said on a show but overall it only happens about 10% of the time that I use it so not really worth making a fuss about.Very happy 10/10 would buy again.",4,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"Purchased these for listening on my bus commute (my iphone 7 doesn't have a 8mm jack) and am very satisfied. They're comfortable (don't rest on the ears), sound is clear and well-balanced (there's good bass but not overhyped), and they paired to my phone easily on first try. Very pleased, especially since I've owned some sketchy headphones in the past for around the same price point. Would absolutely buy again.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"I got these so that I could talk on the phone and listen to audio books while driving in my old Jeep.  It's definitely better then talking on the phone via speaker phone, as I can hear way better with these on, but, the person I'm talking to has to suffer through all the road noise as I end up keeping calls brief.  The noise canceling is nice, I'd say it probably reduces noise about 10-15 decibels, whereas my earplugs reduce about 20 decibels.  They are comfortable enough for my to use them for an hour and a half at a time.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"So I wanted to buy a set of noise-canceling headphones that didn't cost $300. These particular ones had really good reviews so I decided to give them a try. For those not in the military, flying in a C-130 is a loud experience and requires good headphones. Not only did these do the job, I took them on a 15 hour flight when I was on leave in South Africa and they not only worked well, but the battery lasted a long time. I highly recommend these headphones if you don't feel like spending enormous amounts of money on others.",5,1,2018-9-4,1,0,0
"These headphones popped up first in my search for ""noise cancelling headphones"", so I decided to give them a try.  While they muffle the sound somewhat (in this case the terrible music my neighbor plays in his backyard, which is not super loud to begin with), they don't really make much difference.  Works fine for headphones, but if you're looking for a decent pair of actual noise cancelling headphones, you should look elsewhere.  Not happy at all with this purchase.",1,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"I had my reservations for headphones that were only $59.99. Then after I ordered them I saw Cowin has a pro line for their E7. I was nervous these would be cheap or lack quality. While I am sure the Pro model is slight step up, these headphones are AMAZING. I have only been using them for one week. However, I am using them to work from home and they are perfect for this. They will cancel just about any background noise you may have and my coworkers have said my sound quality on calls is great. In terms of Sound Quality I am no expert but I have been enjoying the sound quality. From Bassnectar to Pink Foyd to Kendrick Lamar I have experienced very little muffling and all of the vocals come through very clear. I am someone who always listens to full volume no exceptions. These Headphones I can get away with 50 percent volume and enjoy the music experience.TL;DR- Best Headphones I have ever owned. Great bargain.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0

"These are okay headphones, but definitely not the best thing out there, nor comparable to ones like Bose. The sound isn’t the worst I’ve heard, but lacks depth. The noise cancellation isn’t great either, it just seems to half block noise. I barely used them for two months, and they quit working for me. The Bluetooth is no longer discoverable, and won’t connect to any of my devices. Quite frustrating for a product at this price point. They are fairly comfortable to wear and have a nice heavy feel to them, but I would personally rather have them work.",1,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
No loudness or quality to these headphones at all. I honestly would connect them to my Samsung Galaxy Tab s6 with both the volume settings on all the way up and I was hard to hear not even to say I was expecting the south be clean and loud,1,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0
"I bought these for my mother, so she could wear them when she's outside in her yard. I've purchased a few different pairs for her, and each time she complained that she couldn't hear her music. I was going to give up, but decided to give these a try.Success! She is very pleased with them, said she can hear her music over the mower, barking, etc., and they don't bother her ears.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"I loved the quality of the headphones.  Bought 1 that lasted 2 years.  It would not recharge. Purchased a second one. thinking the first was the headphone's longevity.  The second headphone after several months of use would not recharge.  Corwin was nice to send me a replacement.  Thank you!  However, my third headphone after several months not recharging!  Now I have to order another headphone --- not corwin. It's a shame because I really liked the headphones when working.",1,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"These have a battery that needs to be charged with the cord that is provided.  I was unused to that feature because I had some more expensive Bose headsets prior that did not need charging.  I figured out that I had to charge them and once I did that, they work just fine.  Sound is good.  They have a noise cancelling feature which I guess is good but I haven't used them in a crowd.  I think they fit comfortably on my head.  I wear glasses so sometimes that is a problem with comfort while wearing headset, but these are not hurting my ears at the top.  These were a decent price for what you get.",4,1,2017-11-30,1,0,0
"I figured that I was buying a travel pair of headphones. I don't always like having something in my ear, and I needed an affordable option I felt okay taking to the gym.

It was easy to set up and they sound great.I love the large button to answer calls.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"I had just bought a pair of SteelSeries for $100+ after listening to everyone rant and rave about how amazing they were.

Seems like they’ll last a long time.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"I've owned several pairs of BT headphones. The inexpensive ones are always hit-or-miss. I've had these for more than a year. I take them on the plane whenever we take trips (4-6 times a year) and use them around the house and in the bath constantly. The battery seems to last forever and displays the level of charge in the top of the ""control center"" on my iPhone (most BT sets i've used don't...even AirPods don't...). I actually keep them in the bathroom on a hook, so they encounter a steamy environment every morning and continue to perform like the day they were new.The sound quality is great, and the active noise cancelation is neat. The big brands obviously have slightly better sound and ANC, but certainly not 4-5 times better as their prices would suggest.",5,1,2019-3-23,1,0,0
"Good set of noise canceling headphones for a great price. The sound quality and the noise canceling are good (comparing to $300 pairs that my friends let me try). Battery life is good. In a 14 hour coding session, the headphone still had like 50% of the battery life. Very simple button design. There is only 3 buttons (+, -, and glowing triangle) and switch (Off, Bluetooth and Noise-Canceling). Overall comfortable. I haven't wore them longer than 3 or 4 hours at a time but didn't feel like it gave too much pressure to the head like I have had with other headsets.Overall, if you are looking for a set of headphones to dip your toes into the noise cancelling headset world without breaking the bank, these are really good choice for headphones.",4,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"Sound is amazing, bass is amazing, sound canceling works great. Absolutely loved these and took them everywhere with me.

I was not sure what to expect.  Was pleasantly surprised by what appear to be a very sturdy unit.  Was able to pair quickly and tried watching a movie and listening to music.

Does not block the audio output of the TV,  voices come through very well and I can understand what is being said on the TV with the noise cancelling feature turned on.  Blue tooth works well and was easy to set up.  However silence is what I was hoping to achieve.........did not happen.  A set of foam earplugs worked better than the noise cancelling feature.

People's voices sound like they have blankets over their heads. I would have returned this if it had cost anything close to the price of a new Bose headset. But for the price I'll just be glad to have something that won't break my heart if they get broken in my computer bag.The noise cancellation seems good, but I haven't had a chance to test them against aircraft cabin noise.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"This is a good enough wireless headphone for the price.  The passive noise cancelling is ok. The active noise cancellation is also ok, but it feels as if there is a very slight pressure being applied to your ears while it is active.  This is my first pair of active noise cancellation headphones so I can't say if that is par for the course.  Fit is comfortable, and it is ok for people who wear glasses.  Battery life is very good, and as advertised.  You can spend more and get a better product, but if all you need is an affordable wireless headphone that cuts out some to most of the ambient noise of life, this one will do.",4,1,2018-4-4,1,0,0

I can't compare to anything because this is my first active noise cancelling earphones. I have used them exclusively on airplanes. They do block out much of the sound but my ears still ring for several days after finishing my trip. I don't know if this is inevitable with flying or if it's that hum that I hear when I'm not playing music. I will say that the headphones muted a two year old girl's tantrum. She was sitting next to me and was relentless. I guess that's worth the price.,4,1,2018-10-16,1,0,0

"Edit:  The bluetooth and headphones stopped working for some reason but then started working again out of nowhere.  They also have a tendency to cause any videos you're watching to take longer to load up.  Otherwise the sound cancellation tech is pretty good.  Just a heads up that it only blocks low frequency noises.  You'll still be able to hear a dryer banging, cars passing by, people talking from another room, music, etc.  But say your fridge is humming or there's an electrical grid nearby; it'll block those sounds effectively.",3,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0
"Critical comments: The device's buttons for controlling volume, changing songs, and pausing could be better. You should utilize the other side if its possible so that one side could control switching of songs and the other for volume. I like the sleek design of the buttons. That said, if this edit will increase the cost by more than 10% than perhaps its not worth making. It isn't a big issue for me but my girlfriend did find it bothersome and her complaints are somewhat justified.I haven't tried the audio jack so I can't say I know the full capacity of the device since Bluetooth and direct line quality is different. The codec seems to be good tho and the ""surround sound"" experience that it creates is very pleasing. Will update review after a few months.",4,1,2018-3-20,1,0,0

This is the most expensive pair of headphones I've owned so I don't have anything to compare them to aside from cheapies. But I don't see myself needing to upgrade from these any time soon. I bought these since we travel a lot, and I've used them multiple times now. They don't block out 100% of the noise by themselves (again, this is my nicest pair, so I don't know if a more expensive pair would either). But if music is playing I can't hear anything else.

After reading the reviews on the COWIN E7 and looking at the price I place my order. I must say I was not disappointed. The headphones are smaller than the Bose but sound just as good.

The road noise and fan noise that is removed in NC mode returns in BT mode, and is noticeable during quiet parts of the music.The overall sound quality is poor. At 50% volume on my iPhone, I could already hear distortion in music that sounds amazing in my Airpods.

They seem to be built sturdy, and don't feel cheap.  They didn't completely cancel out bass, but neither did the other headphones I have tried in the past.  The sound quality was great.  The microphone is as good as you can expect for one without a boom.  Overall, they are at least nearly as good, if not as good as models that cost 4 times as much.

I bought one for my sister and have kept 2 as I plan to leave a pair in my bedroom to pair with my television in that room and have the other pair handy to use in the other part of our home. Sound quality is great. The comfort level is the main reason I purchased another pair. They are very comfortable and you can wear them for an extended period of time. You will not be disappointed in this purchase.,5,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"This was my first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so maybe I'm too easily impressed.  I think they're great.  And you can buy a bag of them for what a pair of Bose phones cost.  I'm not listening to anything so special that I need perfect sound quality.  I wear these riding the lawn tractor and can hear fine at mid-level volumes, and it mostly drowns out the lawnmower when they are all the way up.  A nice feature is that they don't distort too bad at maximum volume.  My only complaint is that you use the same button for volume as you do to advance or go back a track, and I always skip a song when I try to turn up the volume.  I chose these based on reviews from a number of similar items that were a little more or less money.  I think they are a good choice.",5,1,2016-9-27,1,0,0

"The headset look classy. I use headphone for movies mostly and the sound quality is great with plenty of bass. I had no trouble connecting through Bluetooth with TV or Computer. It was a firm fit on my head but not too much as to cause discomfort. The noise cancelling was impressive. With a faint noise from a motor in the house, I flipped the noise cancelling on and it did indeed disappear. I use the headphone off and on continuously during the day and the battery lasts long enough that I only have to charge it every few days or so.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
"The earpads are comfortable for extended listening. I haven't used them for music yet, but for videos the sound quality is good. The noise cancelling is not as good as my old Bose headphones, it's more of a change in the sound texture than a reduction. I like these for the price and comfort. Battery life is good and long. Pairs quickly with my iPhone, iPad and chromebook. Sometimes I have to turn off iPad and chomebook then on again to restore pairing.",4,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0

"These headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is good with the noise cancelling off. The sound quality drops off a bit with the noise cancelling turned on. The noise cancelling is very good at eliminating most sounds, but it seems like some sounds are amplified, particularly sounds like someone eating crunchy food.My wife and I both got a pair, but hers stopped charging after a couple months. We contacted the manufacturer and they were very responsive and replaced the defective unit quickly with no hassle.",4,1,2018-7-21,1,1,0
"I recently purchased these headphones for ease of movement while cooking in the kitchen. Because I have destroyed so many headphone aux cables from ripping, crimping, etc., I decided to spring for these wireless ones and have been pleasantly surprised by the audio quality and the well-functioning bluetooth connection and disconnection as I transition between devices. One slight complaint I have is that the range and penetration through my relatively thin apartment walls still does not seem as far and as robust as others I have tried, sputtering and cutting out about 30 feet from the source, even with a full charge on the devices and the headphones. However, I think this is a small negative amid a host of positives. As I haven't been in noisy environments, I haven't explored the noise-canceling feature, so that is why it is not reviewed here. Thank you for reading, and buy with confidence! -D",4,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I bought these to take calls, for my new fully remote job.  The bluetooth connects SEAMLESSLY with multiple devices, better than airpods, and are much more comfortable.  The sound is as much as you could ask for the price point and I've had zero issues so far.  I never leave reviews unless I am super impressed, and I can say I am totally happy with these headphones.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"First of all, the seller is so nice, I initially wasn't able to find the charging cable which happened to be in the box. I reached out to them and they were willing to help, super nice company.The headphone itself feels very comfortable on the ears, cancels all the noise (and I have two young children, go figure!). It holds the charge for days. No problem, pairs up with my laptop so quickly. Even if it is not on, it decreses the noise and I can focus on my work :)",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I was a little skeptical ordering less pricey headphones. I do a lot of yard work and wanted something that would stay on, sound good, and cancel some background noise (skid steer). Right out of the box they felt solid and professional. The sound quality and noise reduction is amazing. They sit on my head where they are put and do not slide around. I would totally recommend these for anyone!",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I am enjoying the earphones quite a bit. The noise cancellation is excellent. Easy to use. I have had trouble wiith pairing, but it is my Chromebook that is not doing it right.I got an email direct from Cowin telling me that they stand behind the earphones for 18 full months with a full replacement warranty. I did not expect that at all. I've had 3-4 bluetooth earphones and none have lasted even a year. I hope these live up to the faith the maker has expressed for them.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0

"Now, I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality of the headphones are amazing.  After reading several reviews on these headphones, I was skeptically optimistic when I finally decided to purchase them.  To my surprise, the headphones are well worth the price.The noise cancellations is great.  The headphones block out or reduce most noise so that almost everything is inaudible while the music is playing.  I sometimes put the headphones on without music just to drown out some of the surrounding noises in my office.  Without the music playing, they don't block out everything, but most quiet noises (people eating, people typing, or general office noise) become nearly non-existent.  However, the sound quality is so good on these things that I almost always have the music playing just because I can, and when the music is playing I am left in my own little world.",5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
I bought these in my hunt for good earbuds/earphones. Bluetooth wise these leave a lot to be desired. To me they weren't loud enough. It was only when i hooked them to my phone via the jack that they sounded louder. I also didn't really see a change when the noise canceling was activated . After a while I stopped using them and continued on my hunt to better sounding earphones. Batterly life is great though and infinite when connected by jack. Overall they are fair. It was for me but could be the best for you.,4,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"If I was to describe the sound quality of these headphones in one word, it would be ""balanced"".  Unlike some of my other headphones (or speakers) that have emphasis on the bass, the E7 presents all tracks equally.  So instead of ""booming character"" the E7's sound is more like ""buttery smooth"".  Makes them ideal for listening to lofi hip-hops or jazz beats while studying.  Noise reduction feature helps with that too.  It doesn't cancel surrounding noises as much as the ipods; it just muffles and reduces the amplitude of them.  I got the green ones and they are GORGEOUS.  The over-ear big cups with the foam are very comfortable too even with glasses on.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"First review I've ever felt I really need to do. Give Credit when due. In this case I'm amazed.. I have several music type speakers. UE speaker, Beats Pill XL, Bose ear buds, Beats earbuds etc.... the most aggravating thing besides their overpriced and just ok sound, is they always need charging, like everyday and they all cost good $$$$. which brings me to this Cowin E7. When i received I instantly charged for 8 hours as directions say. I have been using these for 5 days straight and the battery still has a 1/2 charge left to it.. its insane! the sound and loudness is great too. they don't have the real deep base like the Beats but comparing $69 to $ 300 i can live with that. overall they sound great. Like I stated above I've been using everyday and my ears don't get the stressed feeling as some devises give me, like i need to take off and gives my ears a breather  not here. looks great too  my wife had to see the receipt because she swore I spent another $300, i said not this time..  very Happy ! but this battery.... nothing like it",5,1,2018-1-25,1,1,0
"These are very nice headphones.  I have larger than average ears and have no complaints about how they feel.  The ear pieces are very soft and comfortable.The sound is great, very rich.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
These have made life so much better for me at home and at work.  I can walk around the house and listen to my school work without distractions and wires and at work I can sit at my desk and listen to my lectures without interruptions.  They fit great and are easy to work.  I can still hear a little bit of noise when i have them on but not a lot that can cause distractions.,4,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"These headphones are pretty good for the price point that they were offered at. I think that the noise cancellation isn't as robust as the technology that Bose uses, but having noise cancellation at all is significantly better than not having it as a person who likes to focus with music on. There have been plenty of times where I couldn't hear what was around me, even when my music was at a moderate volume. The criticisms that I have are pretty minor; you can't use the wired mode without the headphone being on which means that they need to be charged. I think the battery life and charge time are good enough where it shouldn't be too much of a problem most of the time though. I also don't recommend charging while using at low power as the headphones will still blast ""please charge"", interrupting whatever you were listening to.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"can't complain at all, it worth my money 💰, if you’re searching a good looking headset and durable unit sound proof, outstanding bass, if you’re a business man, traveler like me, I would strongly recommend you this unit.

Customer service is great, they provide assistance right away and really down to meet your satisfaction.",5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"The volume button on this set is a very poor design. The up and down buttons also work as skip and repeat track. Very frustrating when you want to change the volume and it skips to the next song or podcast. Bad design. Sound and noise canceling are fine for the price point. Also, to return the product I am being charged $8- and have to go to a UPS store. Terrible 👎🏻",2,1,2019-5-2,1,1,0
I like everything except when you turn the volume up it distorts very badly I'm a guitarist been playing since I was 11 I'm 54 now and play everything from bluegrass to metal and everything inbetween so I like my music loud and clear unless the guitarist is using distortion which should also sound clear if it wasn't for this problem I would of have 5 stars all the way around really disappointed thinking of getting a refund based on that but it's just another hastle so I think I'll just keep them to listen to books,3,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"One of the best headphone at accessible price. It works very well, the sound is supported by consistent bass.You will lose some sequence using it in ""noise cancellation mode"" (as normal) but it's not necessary when listening music as this headphone has a perfect isolation from the environment.",5,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

Ear-cup material and headband were flaking off, but the sound, connection and battery were still good.For something that cost so little to last so long was great.

Battery life seems to be really good, I can use these casually with my computer watching videos for a couple hours a day for at least a week before I have to recharge.

I chose these headphones because a friend recommended them to me.I love the colour selection and I am impressed with the noise cancellation and the quality of the sound.  Compared to other products on the market I think this is a really great value for your money.

"Historically, I have used wired ear buds and/or Air Pods, but as I started to travel more - and now with my children at home while I work - these have become a necessity. My company actually purchases these for the in office folks and recommended we buy once everyone was moved to home-based work. My home office is right next to the kid's playroom; thus, when I jump on conference calls or just need to drown-out the world and concentrate, I just slip these babies on. The noise cancellation is incredible - they eliminate almost 100% of the cabin noise on planes, and as a person with inner-ear problems, they actually help me feel less ""ear/listener/noise fatigued"" when I land. Sound quality is also really good, and for the price, you cannot find a better pair of headphones.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0

Wow i am very amazed and I love the sound quality of these headphones. My Son is Autistic. He is very sensitive when it comes to surroundings and this headphones really helps a lot.

"I specifically bought these to drown out the annoying noises at my office. And they work perfectly! I dont even have to noise cancelling on most of the time because i find it almost too quiet.  The price cannot be beat. I wear them for about 6 hours everyday and have to charge them every few days.The one  thing that i dont like is that sometimes it will show the battery life is at 70% and then 5 minutes later it is saying it needs charge. This doesnt happen too often, but i have only had them for about a month.",4,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
I haven't spent over $10 for headphones in years....but I did some homework and learned about Cowin's quality and decided to give it a try. It was a hit!!

Great headphones. Really like the noise cancelling feature. The headphones have a great look to them. They look strong and well built. Not complicated to use. The headphones have well made ear pads and they feel great. In my opinion they are a step above  similar priced headphones. I paired them with my tv and there is a big difference in sound quality. Just great headphones. You will not go wrong with them.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0

I bought them for my daughter to use for online learning, and her teacher can never hear her and/or understand her. After testing them out through multiple devices, conclusion is the mic just sucks. I did contact Amazon for a replacement thinking maybe I just got a dud since the reviews are great for the most part, but the replacements had the same issue - mic didn't work.",2,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0

The headphones are made of cheap plastic but the headband is soft and the ear cushions are soft and thick as well. Battery life has been amazing, I am at around 2 hours of use and hovering around 90%. Comes with a soft carrying case as well which is simply fantastic. The price you pay for what you get is simply outstanding. I will buy these as gifts for family members and look forward to buying more from this brand. Not sure how the price is so low, but so far I don't see anything to cause alarm, they feel cheap but who cares when they sound so good and are so comfortable while being under 100$. Durability is not an issue as I don't throw these around or stuff them in a tight bag, though I could see that being an issue for some.",5,1,2019-5-25,1,0,0
"To start, I really enjoy the fit and feel of the headphones. I use them both casually and professionally for extended periods of time and haven't had any headaches or discomfort from them at the end of a longggg listening session. I really love the BT and Noise-Cancelling capability. The battery life is great and I love not having to charge it all the time. Sound quality is Clean and Strong. I normally mix with studio monitors for my projects, but from time to time I will listen to my mix in these headphones just to test how a casual listener might hear it and its solid! Nice, warm low-end with a present mid-range and no piercing high-range frequencies. Definitely enjoyable to listen with.  Overall, I love this product and I appreciate the customer service as well. I had a few questions and concerns about the product that were met with very prompt and thorough answers.

"I ordered these headphones because I do a lot of phone calls while working from home. Prior to ordering them, people really struggled to hear me on my phone microphone. I was also distracted often by noises going on around me. These headphones are the BOMB!! I was cleaning my bathroom one evening while the kids were here, and they worked so well that I could not hear my partner and children calling me from upstairs (which I normally hear loud and clear!). Again, microphone works really well. I'd say the only ""con"" I can say is they are a bit heavy, but not overbearingly so. I use them for work, mowing the lawn (which, by the way, they cancel most of that noise out, too!), and cleaning around the house. Bluetooth distance is phenomenal. Highly recommend and worth the money!",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I don't really use the noise cancellation, but there have been a few rare occasions where it definitely cancels out droning and repetitive sounds. In addition to that, these fit perfectly around my oddly shaped head and are very comfortable to wear. I was more concerned with these not blocking out ANY sound like my past headsets but this has made my noisy tenants very ignorable.The ONLY negative, is that the built-in microphone isn't usable. It's heavily distorted, and sounds horrendous. The noise is like... Imagine a home phone calling through Discord, and someone on the other end of a Skype call in the next room is hearing it. Definitely buy a standalone mic.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
i really like this headset. i have been looking for a pair that didn't really overheat my ears that much. these did a better job than others i have tried. the quality is great. yet i marked it down because it doesn't like to stay on my head. i adjust it accordingly but if i even lean a little in any direction the band is slipping off my head which gets annoying.,4,1,2019-5-24,1,0,0
"I really like the noise canceling aspect and overall I think this is a great product for the value. The only thing I don’t like is how much heat is produced while wearing them during heavy activities. I had read this on a review before purchasing and didn’t understand what they meant but now I do. I wouldn’t recommend for heavy activity like cleaning or running but they’re perfect for lounging and watching movies, listening to music or plane rides. I will say they were very helpful in the airport for canceling the extra noise while I waited  for my flights.",5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,0
"Noise cancellation doesn't really work.  I never used any other brands to compare, but you get a weird reverb with lower frequencies.

"Admittedly, I’m not a headphones kind of girl. I needed a pair of noise-cancelling headphones because as a medical student, I need silence at a moment’s notice whenever there’s an opportunity to study (I know, what a sad life I live lol). Thus, I wasn’t prepared to invest $300 in Bose or Beats like my peers who would doubly use their headphones to leisurely listen to music. They came in good time, and they looked mad cute in white! The physical quality of the materials isn’t exceptional, but the headphones are undeniably comfortable. They connected easily to my laptop, provided wonderful sound quality, and most importantly, cancelled out background noise really well! I’m incredibly happy with my purchase and excited to use these for years to come. If you’re on the fence, I implore you to buy them; they’re well worth the price. Cowin, you have my loyalty!",5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
I like that these are Bluetooth capable and the battery seems to last a while but the sound quality is very poor and the volume doesn't get very loud. I can still hear outside noises when I'm wearing them and they kind of irritating my ears.

"Great sound but you have to turn it off and on every time you use it, even with an aux cord.  Might not be too big a deal but the power switch is small and not easy to quickly change because besides OFF there are two other options, so if you were turning it on you have to slide it to the option you want.  The hassle of this makes me start to regret the purchase.",4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"I think the sound quality is very good.  I use the headset mainly for watching TV so I don't know how well they would work with music.  Overall quality, construction, and comfort are quite good considering the price point.  They look expensive in terms of fit and finish.  They tend to be a bit uncomfortable after a couple of hours of use, but most headsets I have used are similar in this respect.  The Bluetooth connection is easy peasy and works like a charm.  I don't use the noise cancellation because the headset shuts out most average household noise without using this feature.  In short, the headset is better than I expected and I hope it is durable and long-lasting.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
These are great headphones for the money. I had a pair of beats studio that didnt last 2 years before the bluetooth function failed.

I love that when the battery finally does go in a few years, this headset's battery can be replaced.  On a recent trip back from Dubai I really appreciated the quiet noise cancelling feature.  I was super exhausted after a couple weeks of traveling and it was so awesome to have these phones cut out all the chatter and noise that was going on.  I felt bad for other's around me that were visibly suffering from the constant noise of some of the other passengers.

However, I flew seven hours with the Cowin 7E headset and can verify that the noise cancelling is certainly adequate, the sound is outstanding with great bass reproduction. You can expect to get about four hours of play time on the internal battery. Pack an external battery pack if you need more time. For about $50 this cannot be beat.",5,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0

"These headphones are awesome! The sound is great! As far as the noise canceling feature, I describe it as “being underwater” because that best describes the muffle of the “environmental sound” which is very acceptable to me! AND these headphones are sooooo comfortable and they actually fit! They do not slip whether I’m working out or just relaxing in a chair. This product is so reasonably priced too!  You don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a high quality pair of headphones! I like these so much I just ordered another pair for a gift!",5,1,2017-11-8,1,0,0
"Really glad I bought this! I was using it at the office only and now I finally had the opportunity to take it to a trip and use it during a flight. The bluetooth works incredibly well. I had 4 really long flights and didn't need to recharge it during the whole trip. No wires to manage! In fact, even at the office where I probably use around 4-5 hours a day, I only need to charge it once a week. The noise cancelation feature actually helped with that airplane noise (couldn't hear the movies/tv very well with the regular iphone earphones on previous flights) and I was able to watch movies on my Ipad with great sound quality. I didn't notice much difference at the office turning the noise canceling on and off, but during a flight it definitely makes a HUGE difference. I wanted a great quality headphone at a fair price, and this definitely meet all my expectations. Highly recommend this.",5,1,2017-2-24,1,0,0
"I have purchased earphones before and been very disappointed. It was either the sound was poor, the battery length was too short or the earphones just stopped working! The COWIN E7 have, so far, impressed me with their construction, their sound and, definitely, the battery life. My suggestion is that if you are looking for a great pair of headphones at a reasonable price you should definitely consider the Cowin E7...I don't think you'll regret it!",5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"I wanted these headphones to listen to music while reading, writing, sleeping. Husband is hard of hearing and keeps the tv too loud! My only concern is that I am small, small head, so I thought they might be too big, but they are perfect. And they muffle the tv quite nicely. I've only had them a couple of days, but they seem well made, so I'm hoping they'll last a while. Very pleased with them at this point.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"Best purchase ever! I was hesitating, looked at many online reviews and took a chance. When it came a few days later... put it on and cleaned my whole house in a few hours. I never heard my song list like this before. The sound quality is amazing. They are super comfortable, light weight but sturdy enough, I'm no electronic savvy but I think the durability looks  amazing. I bought them initially for work. My work area needs to have an air vent that is really loud. I couldn't function in these conditions since I already have tinnitus in my right ear. They also look pretty cool. It totally has resolved the situation when the ANC is on. Another great thing I can't understand is when I need to work with people, I just turn off the music, I hear them pretty clearly but can't hear the loud vent. I am really satisfied. I have a small head with no hair , they fit me perfectly. I tested the battery too. I left them with the music on during the night. It lasted more than 24 hours.",5,1,2017-7-21,1,0,0

These COWIN E7's have fantastic sound quality. I'm mostly enjoying the awesome Noise Cancelling. I do a lot of Auto Detailing (shop vac)and quite  a bit of Land Scapping work.

"For the price of these phones, these are pretty amazing, I've had them for a while now and the sound quality is bumpy and loud! Of course noice cancellation could be better but is not bad ad all does a good job!

"Main goal was sound quality, then comfort. These are a solid 10 on both issues. Clear, crisp sound at top volume. The earpiece design is very comfortable for several continuous hours, even with my glasses on. I purchased this unit and a Fire HD 8 specifically for Streaming my Prime Music whether I am working around the house or floating in the pool. Expect the ANC to perform well next time I fly.

"These are very nice headphones.  They are very nice in my office as they do a good job of eliminating outside noise and coworker's conversations .  Not as killer bass response as the Bose, but excellent quality for the price.  Much more comfortable that my previous over ear headphones.  The build quality seems very high also.

I have been pleasantly surprised by these Headphones. They have been comfortable to wear all day at work. They also reduce the noise level from what is going on around me.

"Bought my teenagers a pair for Christmas and they loved them, and it did not break my bank account.  Really nice packaging to start, so they make a good 1st impression upon opening the box.  Colors were nice and vibrant,  The chrome accents look nice.  I did not listen to them, but the kids like them.  Especially the noise cancel feature, as they can vacuum and listen to music at the same time!  Win Win",4,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
I really only need noise-cancelling headphones for flying a few times a year and these seemed like the right price and the reviews confirmed what I now know.  I've always had wired earphones or buds until now and love the freedom!  We tested train noise and other loud sounds using our echo dot and they worked great.  I'm pretty confident that they will work well on a plane but won't know for a couple months.  I can report back if they aren't the best headphones for the price and the features!,5,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0
These sound good and are easy to use. Paring with iPhone was simple and each time they are turned on my iP sees them with issue. I'm a 65 year old adult male with a big head. They fit well.

This is a replacement headset for my original headset broke. It happens. I emailed customer service on a Sunday evening and not only did I receive  a response very early Monday morning they also included a coupon code for to use for a free replacement on Amazon. My new headphones were delivered before I got home from work on Monday evening. I  honestly can say this is the Fastest response and positive settlement I have ever experienced. I am very grateful and delighted on how you have resolved my issue. You now have permanently acquired a happy and thankful customer and I without hesitation will always return to Cowin when I need additional products and will definitely recommend Cowin to all my friends and colleagues. Take a bow Cowin you hit this one right out of the park.,5,1,2017-12-16,1,0,0
"My wife bought these because she wanted an over the ear set of headphones.  I have a more expensive pair of headphones and she really likes the sound, but wouldn't spend the money.  I would say that these are not as clear as mine and the bass isn't as hard-hitting, but the noise cancelling on these is better than mine.  If my headphones break, I will buy one of these instead.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"Hmm loved them at first.  But seem to have static and occasionally make weird poping  noises.Update, they sent me a new pair with updated software apparently. I am bumping my review up from 3 to 4 stars partly for the improvement and partly for the customer service.  The new pair work well so far.  There is a small issue that if they are off or if the battery is dead they don't work.  The old pair still had sound when the power went out or when the noise cancelling was shut off.  So if they run out of charge and you can't charge them you are out of luck.  I will update again if my opinion experience changes.",4,1,2017-7-13,1,2,0
"I have Bose30 bought for $300 - the quality of sound on COWIN E7 is the same in my mind (and I am Bose fan). This is the second COWIN headset I but for my kids. The main thing these are different from the Bose and alike, is the quality of the material - the plastic. but that is well baked into the cheaper price. For kids, that dont need brand like Beats and others, this is a great buy.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"These were my first wireless headphones so I got these based on the good reviews. Not at all disappointed. Work great, comfortable and I love the price.

I enjoy that I don't have to charge them everyday.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"I got this before an overseas trip so that I could better relax on the plane rides. This definitely helped isolate noise. The noise cancellation was pretty good. I gave 4 stars because I directly compared it to a Bose model and of course the Bose has the best noise cancellation I've experienced. But since the Cowin E7 is much cheaper, it had good value to me and I gave it a shot.

"It is a great ANC headphones for the price. It also still has the 3.5mm headphone jack which is a plus. Set up is very easy like any other bluetooth device. It has a normal mode and active noise cancellation mode. I connected it to a transmitter/ receiver to my television,  and now I can hear to my favorite music, and movies without disturbing others or others bothering me. The active noise cancellation works pretty well.  It has great battery life and charging is easy. I usually charge it weekly. I use it for 5 to 6 hrs everyday. Overall, it is a great product for the price. It just looks a little big on my not so big head.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"Pros: Noise canceling worked great on the plane. I never had to have my volume all the way up, which I often do when watching movies on the plane. Very comfortable and light on my head. Easy to pair up with my phone (Galaxy S6) and Chromebook. Sound quality won't blow you away but it's solid.Cons: Like I said, sound quality is good, not great. Just fine for a sub-$100 headphone. Build quality feels like cheap plastic, so I'm curious how long they'll last. I'm glad I bought the carrying case.",5,1,2017-7-25,1,1,0
"My headphones where a joy, sounded fantastic (still do) and cancles a good portion of outside noise. my only complaint is that the bluetooth microphone stopped functioning about a week ago, and despite looking up manufacturers troubleshooting ideas, will not pick up at all. I still have headset sound. But for example, talking to my work team in discord, my laptop picks up my voice (which lends itself to lots of feedback on my end) instead of being picked up by these headphones. Though they get great overall product review, I would have to say not worth buying due to the sub par quality of the built in mic.",1,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0

You can basically still hear what's going on around you and is no different when the noise canceling is OFF. (3) if the noise cancellation is ON, the sound quality becomes a bit muffled or becomes lower quality.

"Upside:  Comfortable.  I put these on and wore them for more than eight hours straight and they felt fine the whole time.  Sound:  Good - not the same as a $300.00 pair of headphones, but better than expected for the price I paid.  Workmanship:  Well made.  Battery Life:  Way better than expected.  I accidentally left them on over night and still got most of the next day without recharging.Downside:  The charging cord is very short.  So if you run out of battery, you're probably not going to want to plug them in and keep them on your head.",5,1,2017-8-13,1,0,0

I always listen to music while flying. These headphones work well to block out the noise in the cabin. The sound quality is far better than ear buds or other in-ear headphones that I've owned.

I received my first set out headphones in November of 2017. Loved them from the first day.  I wore them almost every day for six months. Then through a fault of my own they broke.

Thank you customer support team.,5,1,2018-5-24,1,3,0
I like the quality of the sound but mostly like the amount of time between charges. I’m in Zoom meetings for a good part of my work day. My wireless beats ear buds had to be charged And wouldn’t last the whole day. They also made my ears feel stuffy. Not so with these. Also a lot of people in the house so this really cuts the sound. Also I can walk around more without losing sound.,5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"I've owned them all and still do.  You name it, I most likely have a pair, from Beats to Bose to Sennheiser, etc, etc. I bought these for my daughter thinking they are plenty good for watching YT and listening to music.  I was shocked when I first put them on myself.  The diffrence between these headphones and a $600 pair can only be heard by the most trained ear in the world, which is not me.  I'm a sucker for electronics, so I buy stuff just because, I couldn't tell you the diffrence between this pair and the most expensive pair I own.  I highly recommend them, the only draw back is they are a bit on the ""delicate"" side.  Given the price, you can break 5 pair and still be ahead of the game. Give them a shot, you will not be disappointed.",5,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

I tested the bluetooth mic with my phone and the other party on the line said I sounded a little bit more in a tunnel than usual, but it was clear enough to completely understand me and to have the hands free option time to time will be great.

I have some hearing protectors for shooting range that sound like sudden death but they have no line input and are too bulky.

With it on, it reduces noises like fans, AC and the like, but you can still some loud conversation. The are impressive looking phones and fit over your ears. They are comfortable even if worn for a long time. The Bluetooth works great although the switching is a bit complicated for my 81 yearbold brain.

"Not bad for the price! Noise canceling isn't really ""canceling"" so much as it's just really good at stifling background noises. That is...until you get on a plane. Obviously, any headphone sucks on a plane, but I was hoping these to be a little better than they turned out to be. On planes, normally I can somewhat talk to people without removing my headphones, but these I had to remove to talk.

There was a lot of reviews on these and the majority of them were pretty great, and the ones that weren't said that the customer service more than made up for it. so I bought them, and I waited very impatiently for them to arrive....initial verdict....I love them! The sound is amazing and when you're wearing them, the outside world just melts away. They are very comfortable even for those who have more than two eyes such as me. My only non-gushing feedback if I had to think of one would be that they're a little loose on me which has more to do with my smaller than average head vs anything wrong with the headphones themselves.

I contacted the company once again and issued me the upgraded version of the E7 as an apology. If I were to say anything about the product, just make sure you are gentle with the hinges (where both of my pairs broke). The headphones sound amazing and the noise cancellation is pretty good it was just this one minor flaw that was somewhat annoying.

I used them everyday for about three months and on the second month the point where the right headphone swivels, broke. I inspected it to find that it was made of plastic, I tried to glue it back together with little success. At this price point I wouldn't recommend buying these unless you are careful with them or don't plan on using them excessively, which is something you shouldn't have to do with 60$ headphones.",3,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
The on off switch is supper tiny and is hard to find if you have the headphones on your head.  I find it easier to turn the headphones on before I put them on my head.  Also the volume switch needs to be more tactile so one doesn't need to take the headphones off to adjust the volume.  A wheel would have been better then a paddle switch I think.,4,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0

I don't have to go through the steps of constantly reconnecting them to my laptop. I just turn them on and they auto connect. The ear pads are very soft and easy on my ears.,5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
"Just over a week with this, did the one 8 hour charge to get the battery ready and have been using it every day since with no sign of it stopping. NFC pairing works very well with phones and the bluetooth connects automatically in 1-5 seconds when near a paired device. I'm no audio head, but I do enjoy the audio quality. The ANC seems to work pretty well too. It is a little unintuitive to have the increase volume/skip song button on the bottom and the decrease volume/previous song button on the top, but at least it is consistent. Very user-friendly otherwise.",5,1,2019-4-20,1,1,0
"Muffeled  music, like there is still some packing in the ear cups. Way too much bass, sounds like the low end is  over amplified.

"I bought these as an alternative to more expense Bose headphones to make trans-Atlantic flights a bit more tolerable.  Given the price of these headphones, the noise reduction quality was surprisingly good.  The battery life was sufficient to last the 9 hr flight.  The volume is a bit low and the sound quality is not that of Bose.  However, for the price, they are a good set.  The cables that come with the kit are what you need to connect to the in-cabin video units.  If you are looking for acceptable quality at a bargain price, this is a good choice.",4,1,2017-12-1,1,0,0
"OK, so what can you expect from a pair of noise cancelling headphones that sell for $59?In the case of these babies, quite a bit.

WOW is how I Rated these Wireless Headphones when I first tried them on straight out of the box.  The fit and sound quality were Excellent as well as the noise cancelling feature which I found was not needed at the time; as I stated the fit was great which helped to block out outside noise.  They paired up easily with my MP3 Player as well as my Android phone.  Love these Headphones,5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
My first pair of bluetooth headset for my new laptop. I did not want to spend a lot of money on noise cancelling headset since it is for personal use mainly. I wish one cord would work for the headset at the same time  when charging needed instead of one for blue booth and the other for the headset itself. I hope I don't lose any of the two cords. Thanks,5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"Impressed by these headphones for the price.  I recently tried them out on a two 6 hr international flights.  They definitely cancel out airplane engine noise.  You can still hear talking, albeit muffled, which is not a bad thing.  Battery life has been excellent.  Sound is a bit better when not using noise cancelling.  I also use them at home with my tablet for watching YouTube videos while my wife watches TV.  They work perfectly.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"I researched a LOT on this purchase for an extended flight I had in February. I wanted over-the-ear headphones to assist in noise cancelling and also to leave no guesses to potential talkative passengers as to whether or not I was listening 🤣This ""new toy"" went way beyond typical headphones. Sound quality is impressive and the noise cancelling is solid. It even came with a little pouch for storage. Definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"Bought this as a replacement for an old earphone. Mainly used it paired with an android phone. Sound is OK for its price range... definitely can't compare to higher end Bluetooth headphones. This will be good for taking with you regularly and if it breaks, wouldn't hurt much. Not that it is flimsy, I would definitely say for looks that it is excellent and well made. Packaging and carrying case are really nice. Can't find any flaws visually.",4,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

"I do online school full-time in my ""Office"" that is currently the dining room just feet away from our TV.  Before, I would have to wear my shooting range noise cancelling headphones over my earbuds to hear my seminars if my husband happened to be watching TV.  I can guarantee that for 8-10 hrs a day, they were not comfortable.  So far, my new Cowin headphones have been as comfortable as advertised, the music I've listened to while preparing for school has been clear, beautiful sound.  My husband now has to come wave at me to get my attention!  :)  Great price for the comfort and utility!",5,1,2019-5-14,1,1,0

I brought the headphones to use on the riding lawnmower.  I can hear the music but I can still hear the lawnmower. The pic of the headphones  makes it seems as if the silver parts would be metal or something but it's a cheap looking plastic.  The headphones are lightweight and do work.  I did not know that I could talk to someone on the phone with them but I can.  That was a nice surprise! They did NOT pinch my ears. I will keep them.,4,1,2019-2-11,1,0,0

"The noise cancelling is a bit disappointing. This weird humming noise emits that just makes everything muddy, rather than silent.The battery is surprisingly good. I use it everyday, constantly forget to charge it, but it has never once died on me. For whatever reason, though, you cannot turn bluetooth off to use the headphones at all. This basically makes wired mode utterly useless. If you try to charge and used wired mode at the same time, a horrible screeching noise will blast the entire time. These headphones are clearly designed for those who enjoy bluetooth.",4,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"These headphones are high quality headphones at a discount price.  I have bought well known high end brands in the past for several hundred dollars. They were good, but not noticeably better than these headphones for a fraction of the price.

I have only had them a few weeks so far, but based on my experience, I would recommend them.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,1,0
"Comfortable to wear but weight of headphones makes them easy to slide off. My first pair broke after falling off while wearing them. After trying to use the squaretrade warranty, and found out that it wasn't covered. Afterwards, I was contacted by June a customer representative for Cowin. She asked Joe she could help, offered to send a replacement pair and even upgraded them! I will say, I'm very happy with the staff response and help in resolving the issue 😊",5,1,2018-12-14,1,0,0

"My original unit was defective, since the battery would only last for about 30min. But since then, the manufacturer contacted me and replaced the defective unit. Glad to say the new unit has been powered by the battery for over 10 hours now (and still is working fine).For me the headphones fit well and comfortable (used them for about 8 hours with the laptop watching some TV shows) for over the ear headphones. Since they are over the ear, they already provide some noise reduction if you have them all around your ears. Turning on the noise cancelling feature does eliminate more background noises. I can still hear people and other noises (the volume of the TV shows I am watching with the headsets is not loud), but certain humming noises of a fan were eliminated (I tried using the noise cancelling feature with a loud bathroom fan and I could still hear part of the fan noise, but the humming kind of noise from the fan was cancelled). For performance and cost I would say 4 stars, but since I got good service from the manufacturer too, that bumped it up to 5 stars.",5,1,2017-1-15,1,0,0
"I have enjoyed this head phone for 4 months (5 long trips by airliner).  It seems to cancel noise well, but the big surprise was the good quality of Bass.  The E7 are worth the money - a small faction of the price of others, and solid performance.  Maybe it could use more High end, but I am an old man and can't hear that range much anymore regardless.  I hope this helps.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"ANC does not work very well.  Not sure how any scheme to cancel audio noise can be done without a microphone on each speaker enclosure to sample noise, do an FFT on it and then generate an opposing audio signal.  I have a Jabra ANC headset, which was about 1/2 the price of this one, that works much better in cancelling noise (does not work wireless).  This one has a wireless interface which works fine and the music audio is good..",2,1,2018-1-9,1,2,0
"When I bought these, I was commuting to work every day on the train, so having a good pair of noise-canceling headphones was important. The audio quality is solid - I listen mostly to rock/metal, and these seem to be pretty well attuned to that. The noise-canceling function works well and blocks a vast majority of outside noise. Most importantly, these things are comfortable to wear. I usually wear glasses and over the ear headphones can become uncomfortable quickly. I can wear these for hours without any issue. The only weak point I've noticed is that when I do take calls while wearing them, people have a tough time hearing me and they pick up a lot of background noise. That's a pretty minor issue though, given that these are largely for music.",4,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"These headphones are awesome. I use them when I am recieving infusions at the hospital. They cancel out almost all noises, watching a movie, listening to music or audio books is great because there are no distractions.

"When I say these are the best headphones I’ve found for the price, that includes the last set I had that were $60 more and weren’t nearly as good. These headphones look cool as hell and sound amazing especially in the noise canceling setting. I bought them because I work in a noisy data center and I never have trouble hearing my favorite songs clearly over the constant drone. If you can’t afford to drop $200 or $300 on the fancier noise canceling headphones, go for these. You won’t be disappointed.",5,1,2019-4-1,1,1,0
"I'm able to use these phones right away by plugging in the cable that came with it. The sound quality is excellent. I still can't get them to work without the cable, and sometimes they won't work at all. The charge lasts a long time, but I probably should have gotten cable phones in the first place. I never have gotten through to tech support.",4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I have had these headphone for a year and I love them. They are great for blocking out noise while studying or taking tests. They do a great job of cancelling out noise and they’re very comfortable on my ears. When I do use them with sound to watch videos or Netflix the sound quality is excellent. The microphone works very well and cancels out a lot of background noise too.I just wish that they would connect to my laptop over Bluetooth instead of manually with the cord. Bluetooth works fine with my cellphone, just not my laptop unfortunately.  Also the cord used to connect the headphones to the jack on my laptops slides out really easily with no effort at all. That aside this is still a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone. Would also purchase again, no questions asked!",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I ordered this based on the large amount of positive reviews. I found that most reviews are accurate regarding music sound quality.

I am going to try to call tech support back, but so far not impressed with phone call sound quality.",4,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"I bought these solely for their noise canceling capability before a long trip. Unfortunately they didn’t cancel noise at all. I’m not sure how the reviews are so high.

I have no idea what sound quality they offer.",2,1,2019-5-13,1,1,0

I bought these for my sons 15th birthday.  They came highly recommended when I researched alternate options for Beats.  I was really impressed when he opened the package.  They look very sturdy.  The charge on them is fantastic.  He connected them through Bluetooth to his phone and to his desktop as needed.  They came with a nice carry case to put them in.

"I bought these headphones because my Apple ear buds were failing, and I wanted something that would block out noise for more effective studying. The noise-cancellation feature does not block out noise completely (which could be dangerous), but muffles it enough for a calming effect. The music quality is great, and the wireless bluetooth feature is helpful. The battery charge lasts for a long time. The only problem with the headphones is that they slipped off my head if I tilted my head down or moved around too much.

Sound quality is decent for YouTube videos, and any form of media that primarily contains speaking. Not great for music, unless you're listening to rap/hip hop; wouldn't recommend if you primarily listen to rock or other instrument based music. Bluetooth range is decent, but seems to get shorter over time. One big complaint I have about this headset is the build quality. My last pair just recently broke around the ear cups, most likely due to the fact that that part of the headset is constantly expanding when put on your head.

Wish they went a little louder. I feel like every set of headphones nowadays has limited volume. I’m sure for hearing protection but I would prefer to control how loud something can go once it exceeds “loud enough”.  If you’re in a quiet place these a louder externally to those around you then I would like. Just in case you like listening to anything inappropriate. You can of course lower the volume but that defies the point,5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0

Unfortunately (for anyone reading this review), this is my first set of Bluetooth headphones so if this is the norm I can promise I will never purchase another pair. I read so many positive reviews and was sure I was in for success, but what I received was a drastically overpriced product that did not provide the quality promised.

I kept the VANKYO C750 as they had the best overall all performance ESPECIALLY mic quality for voice command and audio quality on the receiving end.",2,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"Great if you have a small head or are a kid. The sound quality is awesome as is the noise cancelling feature. I have a 7.5 hat size (not big) and these were stretched out on my head, I gave them to my niece, they fit her better.",3,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
This is a quality product for the price. These headphones work well with bluetooth and noise cancellation. Only complaint about them is that the aux wire doesn't work with the microphone for those times where you want to be wired. Also they feel cheap but they have held up since purchase and the price is significantly less than other comparable products.,4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
Awesome customer service and fast delivery!!! The one I got had a strong new paint smell and I reached out to support about it and they just sent me a new one without any hustle. I also got to keep the old one too.Noise cancellation is a 4/5. Had to stop using it for a bit since it maid my ear ringing for a couple of days.,5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
When this headset works it works great. The sound is outstanding. Even the microphone is good. The bad news: it does not connect reliably to any of my devices. They're almost unusable.,2,1,2020-8-6,1,1,0
"I've been in the market for some good over-the-ear headphones for a while and decided to order these. I'm so glad I did! They are comfortable and I love that they are wireless. I use them at work and even at the gym. The only thing I've found to be an issue is if you wear glasses daily, I would be weary. They can start to hurt around your ears if you have them on with your glasses (after an extended period of time). But other than that, I highly recommend these headphones!",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
"If you wear these a lot the pivot will wear out and they will break.  I fixed it when it happened on the right side and then it happened on the left shortly after.  So that is the weak link in the product.  Good price. Fairly comfortable. I am not completely dissatisfied because I did get a lot of use out of it, However there is no reason for such a critical part of the mechanism to fail.",2,1,2019-2-13,1,2,0
Great sound & easy bluetooth pairing.  Battery life is VERY good and recharge time is excellent  My only complaint is the difficulty of changing the volume if you're 'wearing' the headset.  I wear them to bed at night and just can't locate those controls in the dark since the + & - 'buttons' are not really buttons but rather shallow relief symbols.  BUT....these headphones are really really good once I get them adjusted.,5,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0
"I havent' tried other noise cancelling headsets and hence can't say much about them, but this one does the job for me. Considering the price I paid, I am happy with it. The only reason I reduced one star is due to the carry on bag it came with. It's too small and it's pain to put it inside, so I don't use it and just put it in the bag. Would have liked those hard cases. Otherwise, I am happy with everything else.",4,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I bought these because my home office is a 10x10 room with wood floors, and the mic on my laptop picks up all kinds of background noise, and the awful echo that comes with having wood floors in an office.The plug n play went very smoothly and the sound quality of hearing others or music through the headphones sounded great. However, for the reason that I purchased these, I did a test with multiple coworkers via Zoom who could not tell the difference between when I spoke, when I had the headphones on and when I used the laptop mic. I of course made sure that the sound in Zoom was selecting my laptop as the mic, and then verified the mic was the headphones during the test. Bummer!! I recommend for people who don't plan to use these in echoing hard floor environments.",3,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Great sound, but no sound if the battery is not charged.  Only earphones I have bought that did this.  I need them for work, but they are worthless when i need them and the battery has dissipated.  They have to be plugged in at all times if you don't want to run the risk that they will not be charged when you need them.",2,1,2019-10-17,1,1,0
These headphones were actually pretty good for the price. I honestly just needed them for a last minute flight in order to tune out the engine noise and be able to hear my movies but they turned out so great that I’ve been using them all the time. They also come with an aux cord for non-bluetooth devices (or to save some battery life) Definitely going in the suitcase for every trip from now on. Only downside is that the volume/seek buttons are reversed which is annoying and the earpieces get hot after awhile because it’s some kind of fake leather fabric.,4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I've been using these for a while now, bought one for myself and one for my wife. Not that impressed with the noise cancellation, but that's not specifically what I bought them for. The sound is incredibly clear, just as good or better than the previous headphones I had that I paid close to $200.00 for, I won't mention the name  (Sony). I  love them, would buy them again without hesitation.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"It works and you can tell the difference from other good brands like Sony or Bose. However with a quarter of the cost, what do you expect?  Cheap material. Not bad for flights, and not good for bus rides",4,1,2019-8-14,1,1,0
"This works great.  Noise cancellation is not perfect, but to be fair, I am trying to cancel white noise from an air vent.  That's probably asking too much.  But it does help significantly.  The sound quality is good.  I use them mainly for phone calls.I have picked up stray communications but only _before_ I properly paired them with my own phone.",5,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"I've used these for the past year, and they seemed great. In the past week, however, the left earpiece started to ""slip"" downward from where it is attached. It was annoying, but seemed to still work. Today, the left earpiece completely detached and it broken.I am disappointed that I spent the cash on these for them to only last about a year. My plan is to replace these with a higher quality (and likely more expensive) pair so I don't have to re-purchase a $50 headset every year.",2,1,2020-6-23,1,1,1
"This pair of earphones is an upgrade to the one's I have previously used.  The price was right.  The earphones performed well with noise cancellation and I did need to remove them in order to understand the flight attendant and any messages.  Battery life was quite good, as I had 5 flights with connections and the earphones lasted throughout.  They did have a tendency to roll forward so that the headband ended up on my forehead a couple of times.  More padding on the headband would be appreciated.  The sound quality was amazing, although the volume seemed to require setting at an extremely high level.  All in all, quite a good purchase.",5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
Sounds great to me. Noise cancelling is yet to be determined. Good blue tooth range. 4 stars because of noise canciling. Over the ear headset blocks most everything anyway. Just cant tell differerce between n/c and no n/c.... as others have said if use the aux in put it wont work and u cant recieve calls. I like em anyway. Good build. Look nice. I probably wouldnt spend extra for the noise cancelling. Otherwise thete fine. Update...... Been using for a year now. They are starting to get a little loose but I use em with stocking caps and hats sometimes. Batteries still great run time.  Good quality. Update::been using for 3 years now. They are getting a little rough looking. Gonna buy another pair,4,1,2016-12-31,1,0,0
"I really love these. The only reason I took off a star is that the noise canceling works so that people can’t hear your music which I love, but I can still hear things going on around me. That’s not a huge problem because it isn’t a distraction, but it wasn’t quite what I expected. Comfortable headphones and easy to use. A hard case would have made me feel a little more comfortable carrying them from place to place but it doesn’t stop me.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"The microphone isn't great, but the sound is fantastic.  It connects via Bluetooth to paired devices very quickly.  One other thing I'm not fond of is the way it makes my ears feel--like extra pressure between my ears/jaw.On a note of far lesser importance, my partner said they looked kind of throwback.  As if the design was meant to mimic some pair of 90's Sony headphones.  I'm inclined to agree, take that for what you will.",4,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"I'm very happy with my purchase.  The sound quality is above average, but the noise cancelling is excellent.  I wear these at work and it really helps to reduce background noise.  I really like the features of being able to answer calls, pause music, turn down the volume from the headset.  Paired with my Google Pixel XL 2 these headphones have exceeded my expectation for a very reasonably cost.",5,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
"I love these headphones.  I wear them for both indoor video conferences and outdoor music/audio listening.  My first thought was that they might be a bit too heavy, but I quickly got used to them.  They stay on well while I am doing heavy outdoor work.  The battery life is tremendous.  I can wear them for hours and hardly make a dent in the battery percentage.  Well worth the price.",5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I was so excited to find an affordable pair of noise cancelling headphones, and so hopeful for these. They worked GREAT for 2.5 months, and suddenly the sound just stopped working. It was there, but faint. I tried all trouble shooting I could think of and could not fix it. I tried to get assistance online, but it was useless. I tried to exchange, but ultimately decided to just return them and figure something else out. I'm still using my earbuds.",1,1,2018-9-27,1,2,0
"Noise cancellation feature is awesome.  I set the TV volume to my usual level on my regular news channel, put the headset on with the noise cancellation feature on and I could only hear the faintest of sound from the news anchor.  When I started playing music on the headset, it  blocked out the TV and all other sounds completely.  The sound quality is also great as well as the look, material quality and finish..  Only minor issue I can point out is that the ear cups could have been a little bigger to cover my ears with some allowance.- I guess I have big ears.  As it is now- it fits snugly which is still good anyway... If the battery life holds up as long as the product description says it should, then I'm totally convinced this was a best for value purchase.",4,1,2018-4-11,1,1,0
"very nice headphones, fits nice, it's just too much bass for me. While watching tv there is too much bass to where I can't understand the actors talking. Too much bass while I listen to my 50's 60's 70's music... I also miss a lot of background noise. A little hard to explain this. I like my $10 headphones sound better. But with them I hear everything that's going on in the house. The Cowin cuts out that noise. So I might toss a coin to keep or send back. M.R.",4,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0
Tested out listening to a movie while large air compressor was recharging. Thought compressor was off until I took headphones off to check. LOL!!! Compressor is unusually loud and annoying and blocked out noise from 10 feet away and could still hear the movie very clearly. Seem to be great quality for price. 4 stars for now as I don't know how they will work yet on airplane. Keep you posted.,4,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"I bought these to use for music, sure, but basically to stop me having to listen to my husband's loud bad TV choices. I am rooms away and can still hear the TV.

"I have had the E7 headphones for a couple of weeks. I am enjoying both the sound quality and comfort.I use them in the office to block the sound of conversations in the area, they work great for that. And the sound of the music is great!

These Cowen E7 headphones will not consistently pair with my TV. TV  repair tech (TV under warranty) confirmed and referred me to the many on line reviews and articles related to problems with these headphones not pairing or not consistently pairing with multiple items. Beware when purchasing; go online and look for Cowen E7 manuals and E7 Pairing problems before purchasing. My recommendation is do not purchase; you may face non-reliable pairing or unable to pair at all.,1,1,2019-5-12,1,0,0
"After I received and charged the headphones, I put them on and immediately noticed that the right headphone emits a loud, continuous, high-pitched shriek-like sound when pressed against the ear with the noise-cancelling mode on. The noise is absent when it bluetooth only mode.EDIT: I contacted the company's customer service email address from the comment below, and they were very helpful. I was given code for a new set of the headphones and same day delivery at no charge. There are no issues with the new pair at all, and, if I hadn't received the defective pair to begin with, this would have been five star review.",4,1,2016-10-24,1,4,0
"I have only had these headphones for a few day, but already I think they're great!  Beautiful sound.  Fairly easy to use, (although I'm still really experimenting with them).  Noise cancelling seems okay, even though I'm not familiar with noise cancelling headphones. The battery seems to last quite a while and I can go down the stairs and into other rooms with no problem. Unless it just crashes or something, this is a keeper.Update:  I've had these headphones for a few months now and I still really love them.  They are exactly what I wanted.  I highly  recommend them!!",5,1,2017-5-4,1,0,0
"These are the absolute best for noise cancelling at this price point.  The sound tends to be more toward the bass end of the spectrum, but are on a part with Beats and more expensive headphones in my opinion.I use them with my guitar amp, and they work great for that.  I use Peace EQ on my laptop and that really rounds the sound out on my laptop.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0

I purchased these to make online videos but the mic quality has a lot to be desired. It sounds like I have my face in a pillow while talking.

"These are very nice headphones. The noise cancelling is good, eliminating the low frequency noise from motors and fans while muting mid-range noise. Sound quality is very good, missing a bit on the low end but still nice. Mid-range leaves a bit to be desired as sax/horns are a bit strained but acceptable.

I will never take any airplane flight again without my noise cancelling headphones again!  The volume from a movie can be heard so easily and even just wearing them during the flight to cancel out the engine noise is wonderful.

If you're the kind of guy that wants to hit the bass super loud, this is not for you.Also, I don't know how you could possibly fix this because these headphones are already very light, but, after an hour or so of listening, my head starts to ache due to the pressure the phones inherently make. That's something I don't know how to fix, but nonetheless very annoying.",4,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0
"I love these headphones! Excellent quality in the ear. Fits ok around the ear -I wish it were a little bigger. I cannot find a volume control which would be nice. I love the pause, play, front and back arrows on the side. Easy to use. One draw back is when you law down the head phones are large so you cannot lay on a pillow and if you roll over the controls on the side will press, so you could have pausing or skipping as a result. Overall for the price, it is well worth it.",5,1,2018-3-27,1,0,0

I have a bose noise canceling headphones too but they are almost the same. I sue my bose only when I travel by plane and I don’t want to overuse that with the amount I paid.

"I listen to music all day  not much of a tv person. I listen 2 several genres, but I bought these specifically for gospel (2 hear the words), and for watching tv  (I'm a little hard of hearing) I am a bass junkie! I love tracks more than lyrics. So on every device I own I have the EQ adjusted accordingly. Music up front, lyrics in bck. I spend alot of money on quality stereos, headphones, ect. When I first played these it sounded awful! Then something told me 2 adjust my settings like a ""normal person"" would. It was AMAZING! Better then my BEATS!! Now they are my every day headphones and they can handle all the bass in my rap music! Quality is GREAT. Only problem..I can't get it 2 bluetooth 2 my rocketfish transmitter so I can watch tv.

You get what you pay for. The noise cancelation is no good. The product is quite fragile. When i tried to pull on the ear cover to fit my head the plastic snapped. This was after a few months of use (not daily use but 2 times a week or so on average). I had to trash the product after less than 7 months of use. The ear cover also isn’t oval and is round and i had to squish my ear lobes to fit that in. Don’t waste your money on this. I went and bought a bose headphone and what a difference!,2,1,2020-3-1,1,1,0
"I really wanted to like these.  They sound as good as the Bose QC 35's I had for a fraction of the price.  They don't come close to the NC of Bose---nobody does---but they were decent enough.  The problem is the ear cups are just too small for a guy's ears.  They are about the size of headphones that sit on top, rather than over the ears.  I had to fold my earlobes inside the cups and the headphones became uncomfortable in no time. Had to send them back.",3,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0

"So far loving these, only issue I've had is at higher volumes if I'm in a quiet room the noise bleeds out. My boyfriend and I tested it and at Max volume other people can hear what you're listening to at about the same level as a lower speaker sound just a little distorted.

"Wanted a pair of noise canceling headphones, but didn’t want to spend $100+ when I only need them on my lunch break and the few times a year I travel by plane. Was skeptical with them costing $50 bucks (after $10 digital coupon). Wow! Compared to my friend’s Sony Noise Cancelling $200 headphones these are right up there with the Sony for my Netflix Shows. They come with a nice leather case, and an 18 month warranty but if you register your product they up it to 24 months! I’ve been recommending these to my friends and I’d recommend them to you! Never again will I justify $200+ noise canceling headphones, I’m getting ripped off at that price! Only complaint is they feel a little cheap and not strong as say Bose or such. But with a 24 month warranty I’m ok with that.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Cheaply made, seemed more was spent on the packaging.  Switching between device is a hassle.  This headphone is also susceptible to interference from a few feet away.

The only good thing about this is now I want a Bose or a Sony headphone.",2,1,2019-1-5,1,2,0
Bought these for my wife. She wanted to have a set of headphones next to the bed so she could watch TV while I was sleeping.

"These are easy to use and the sound quality is quite good. My only gripe is that they're definitely not fully noise cancelling.

I'm new to wireless headphones - so I really can't compare them to the big name brands.  But the sound quality is excellent.  I haven't been in the right environment to truly test the noise cancellation feature.

"So I’m just writing this because I’m bored at work. I got these headphones about a week ago because  of the reviews here. Everyone was basically saying “this is the beat pair of headphones I’ve ever had”. After trying these headphones myself, I don’t think these people have used that many other headphones before. The sound quality is just normal, and the Bluetooth is way too loud for me (even at the lowest volume setting). They are not that comfortable to wear either, they squeeze my head. Cosmetically, they are the ugliest pair of headphones I’ve ever had - they look like a child’s toy.These are just average headphones, worth the price of $50 maybe less. Don’t listen to the reviews saying that these are awesome and oh my lord I’ve never owned anything so cool before, they really aren’t that great. I ended up returning mine.",3,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0

I refrained from eating the bass and sound quality because I didn’t really have anything to compare them to, but I couldn’t help but notice how well the noise cancellation worked. I was once sitting on the porch for a while without the noise cancellation. I remembered that function of the earbuds, turned it on, and thought the headphones had stopped working from the deafening silence. I didn’t give five stars in that category because the noise cancelling does cause me to get those weird ear-bubbles(for lack of a better term) like when you take off in an airplane. Overall, I’m happy with all aspects of the headphones. I have a bit of trouble with my ears getting sore after prolonged use, but I don’t think there’s any pair of headphones that one can wear for 6* hours without making your ears sore.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
The sound on these headphones are incredible. The range and clarity are exceptional. A funny thing happened when I set these up with my iPad. I had them on and I’m looking at my iPad. I was thinking these aren’t working I’m still getting sound from my iPad. Then I thought wait a minute I’m wearing the headset. I lifted up one ear and yes all the sound was coming through the headset nothing from the iPad. The sound was so perfect it fooled me. I highly recommend them.,5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Bought these for my boyfriend because the reviews were so good. He works in a factory and is on a fork truck all night. He listens to his music while working but also needed headphones where he could answer his phone when they called him. Unfortunately these aren’t the ones for that. He said the sound was ok for the music. But when it came to talking on the phone, he couldn’t hear anyone and they couldn’t hear him. We will be returning these. These are good if you’re using them somewhere quiet, but not somewhere with a lot of noise.",3,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
"I was surprised by how comfortable these headphones are and how well they fit. Additionally, the noise cancelling works incredibly well. I have a big fan behind me and it cancels it almost completely. I'd definitely suggest these.The only negative is they don't come with a bluetooth adapter, so if you're planning on using them on your PC you'll need to buy one.",4,1,2017-8-14,1,2,0
"My daughter loves these headphones. She owned a previous pair but the leather finally came off of the ear cuffs and headband.  So, I bought her another pair but this time in her favorite color.  She has not taken them off since.  Well, maybe here and there.  She said the sound is good but the noise cancelling could use some work.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I tested this on my recent long flight to Asia and while the headphones were able to cancel out noise of the plane, I could hear the noise of babies crying very clearly and also people talking very clearly.

It does as advertised the sound is good and the ability to use or not use the noise cancellation feature is cool the life is as advertised as well I use the headset when I go to the gym and I can charge them fully once and not charge them again for over a week I spend about 2 hours in the gym 4 days a week and yes I cut them off after but I won’t need to charge them again for almost 2 weeks this is one of my best purchases off amazon,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,1
"Mine broke, after 3 months of minimal use, they are too heavy for me to wear on a regular basis, for more then 3 hours at a time.  Anyway, the side broke off.

I’ve had many different headphones over the years ranging in price from $300.00 plus to as low as $60.00 for work or just spare. But I must say these Cowin E7 noise Cancelling Headphones are the bomb and compare to the more expensive ones for a lot less money. I was that impressed with them I bought another pair for my son within 2 days of getting mine. Great product and very well made.,5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I don't notice a difference between the regular and noise cancelling setting, but am satisfied with the quality for the price. I do struggle at times finding the on/off switch in the dark.

"I like the sound quality for listening to music. It puts me in my own little world. It has good bass and sound quality that overall I like a lot! I’m completely satisfied with it. The noise cancellation on its own muffled but does not cancel noise. I cannot do detailed work like transcription with much noise going on. I cannot do detailed work like transcription with much noise going on around me. So if you’re looking for your own quiet little world these do not work.

"Reduces street noise (even voices) by about 50% in noise cancelling mode. Very good sound quality. I have a highway near my house and this is really improving my evenings out on the patio. Have not yet used them on a plane (which was my main reason for buying them), but they do so well with the traffic noise, I'm sure they'll perform just as well when flying. Great value compared to similar products.",5,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0

"I wanted a pair of noise cancelling headphones, but didn't want to pay a steep price. I saw the reviews for this one, so I decided to try it out for myself, and I couldn't be more pleased! You get very similar quality compared to $200 headphones, and these are extremely comfortable as well. I use them for pretty much all my audio needs, including music, webinars/teleconferences at work, etc, and they do an amazing job at it all.If you are looking for a good pair of noise cancelling headphones at the fraction of the cost of premium bands, look no further than this. This is exactly what you need!",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I bought the A7 ANR headset a few months ago. Yesterday I used the A7ANR on a 13 hour flight from Los Angeles to Beijing on American Airlines 181.  It is very noticeable  when I would turn off the ANR the 30dB noise gain.  I am a private pilot and have a BOSE A20 headset and do not think the ANR is as good as the A20.  But the A7 costs about US$60 and the Bose A20 costs US$1,200.  These are well worth the money.",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"I received these headphones, they look good, the sound is quite good (I can't hear my co workers anymore!!!) but when on noise cancelling mode I had a terrible sound coming out of one of the headphones.

They had a replacement pair sent the very next day (there is an 18month warranty evidently!), I'm so happy with the headphones and that their quality is backed by a solid customer service team!",5,1,2018-9-28,1,0,0
I was looking for a wireless headphone so I can watch TV while my wife is sleeping or listen to music from the computer while I am working without having to plug my earbuds in with a wire across or under the keyboard.  Some reviews say not enough bass or not loud enough.  Well let me tell you.  The sound level is great!  And I am loosing my hearing.  The treble and bass are great.  I have watched an entire movie on a single charge and when you need to charge it up again it does not take long.  These Cowin wireless headphones are great.,5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

"COWIN E7 is a very good noise canceling Bluetooth headphone with an excellent battery life. I use it nightly 2-3 hours with my TV for up to a week before recharging is required. Have now used it for about a month without encountering any problems. Bluetooth syncing was very quick and problem free. Once the set was synced with my TV on repeated use the headset is automatically connected with the TV, once I turn the headset  on. In comparison to other similar headsets COWIN E7 is very reasonably priced. COWIN keep up the good work!",5,1,2018-4-8,1,0,0
I had a pair of Beats Studio 3 headphones that didn't last a full year.  The leather on one ear cup split after a few months of wear time and eventually fully exposed the foam underneath and then a few weeks ago the headphones stopped working.  I bought these Cowin E7 headphones as a replacement (they arrived today) and immediately noticed better noise cancelling (in the same room with the same background noises).  They seem to fit better and stay on my head while the Beats weren't tight enough and would fall off when I bent over to pick something up off the floor.  I had no issue pairing it with my Android phone (it's possible the Beats headphones work much better with Apple products).,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
So as bluetooth headphones these work great. They are comfortable to wear  (even while wearing my glasses and I have a cartilage piercing). The noise canceling feature is a total joke though. The sound quality is significantly impacted and I could still hear idle conversation happening 50 feet away. It’s not even worth it.As bluetooth headphones they sound good and you sort of get what you pay for. These aren’t the best but they are a good bang for your buck if noise canceling isn’t a deal breaker. I’m keeping them for Bluetooth functional,3,1,2018-5-2,1,0,0

"This headset is amazing. I have a very small head and have used many different brands. The sound quality is perfect and crisp. The bass makes my head shake, the treble is on point, and I just all around love them. Even if I sweat, the they do not slip off of my head. My ears do not hurt after wearing them for two hours. I love them. These will be the only headset I will buy",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"Nice but not the best sound quality or bass. The price is right for the quality. IMPORTANT! There is not auto-off. If you leave them on when you stop using them, the battery drains completely. They are comfy and the noise cancellation is decent. The ear covers do plenty of cancellation on their own without the electronic assistance.",4,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"I purchased these a few months back and have had the pleasure of testing them out in several situations. From traveling on Amtrak, to studying at home with my roommates playing a movie at a high volume in the living room. They don't cancel out every single sound but they do cut out a pretty significant amount, particularly enough to remain focused on studying or enjoying music & videos on public transit. The battery life seems pretty spot on, at least to me since I've only had to charge them once & have used them infrequently for about 13 hour of play over the months I've used them. As a final note, they are decently comfortable but my ears do need a breather from them after about 35 minutes of straight wear.",5,1,2017-8-19,1,0,0

"Item broke after 12 hours and customer service was so slow to respond, I just returned them.Edit: so 3 months after my initial order, customer service reached out to me again to send a replacement item for me to update my review. Still really slow response times, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Maybe it was just a fluke. Well received the new one about a week ago. And while it's still functioning, the volume control has never worked. So after 2 products from them several months apart, I think the quality is poor. I've raised my rating bc they did make an effort to correct the situation.",2,1,2018-5-3,1,1,0
"the headphones are great and seemed to work good for about a month or 2 then the Bluetooth would not connect sometimes, and or if they were connected I would not get any sound out of them. They did come with a AUX cord for connection and that cord was kind of cheap and did not last very long with the amount of use I got out of them with playing games on my laptop. I am a gamer and expect the headphones to last longer than a month or so. When I tried to get a replacement they would only give me a code to purchase another one at a low cost and then later refund what I paid instead of just sending me out a replacement for free. Personally after reading the reviews about this happening to others I would look elsewhere for a better headset. I purchased 2 of these and they both have had issues.",4,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I don't consider myself to be an audiophile, but in my opinion I think the sound quality is great.They are easy to use once you get used to where the buttons are.

They are also well made and seem to be of high quality materials.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"Sound quality, noise cancelling, and comfort are fine but when I shake my head or press on it while using the noise canceling feature it makes a noise. It also makes a lot of beeping when the batteries are low. If that’s to protect the batteries I would like to know, but it’s still an unnecessary feature, I rather have it shut off without that kind of warning since I can see the battery level on my phone. I also don’t like how low it DOESN’T go and how it beeps when it I turn the volume so low it mutes itself.",3,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"When I first got them I was so shocked at how beautiful they looked, I literally told my sister, ""I'm never touching these things!"" of course, she rolled her eyes, but then I was curious as too what they sounded like. I quickly fell in love with the E7 headphones. As an audio engineer, I've used various brands from professional to consumer, but not many consumer products have come close to the clarity and quality like these E7's have. I've never heard of the (Cowin) brand, but I'm definitely interested in the company and their products now. As too the noise-cancelation, these are my first pair (others are too expensive for my investment). For me, a person who takes public transportation, they work really well. They became a great birthday present from me, I really love them.",5,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0
"I really liked the look of these and was super excited to try them out. Here's my honest review from a daily gym goer.A. The fit is loose.

"I have used the Cowin E7 headphones since they arrived about a month ago, and I am loving them.  Have connected them by Bluetooth with my smart tv, both of my laptops and my Samsung S8 smartphone and they worked flawlessly.  Earbuds are great, certainly, but my E7's block out the sounds of the world and immerse me in other worlds.  Something very necessary in this world of Corona.  Very well made.  I can recommend them without hesitation",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"After enjoying my Cowins E7s for many months, the right side of my headphones broke.  I was so disappointed.  Thankfully, I was within the 18 month window of the warranty. I e-mailed Cowin's Customer Service and received a reply the next day.  They apologized for the inconvenience, gave me an Amazon code for a free new pair of headphones, and BAM, I was back in business.  No muss, no fuss.If you're like me and use these headphones daily on public transit, I do recommend you get a carry case when storing them so that you can toss them in your bag without worrying about them getting bounced around during the commute.  But with the price point, the quality of the sound and the quality of customer service, I definitely recommend these headphones!",5,1,2018-5-10,1,1,0

"Although it took me a while to actually be able to use these for watching tv (because of faulty transmitters purchased), I wish I had bought them sooner.I have really good hearing, but I hate having to turn the volume up on a movie to hear the dialogue and down for noisy scenes.

"I bought a bluetooth dongle so I could use them with my personal PC, and they work great! I also use them with my cell phone for audio and have even conducted one phone call with them. The other person can hear you just fine, but they can also hear everything else going on. My parents had a TV show on in the other room and my friend could hear not only what show it was, but describe the episode.  It's got pretty decent noise cancellation; not perfect but pretty good, and they don't squeeze your head super hard. The battery lasts a very long time, I'd say up to about 20 hours, the sound is just a little odd when they're about to die. The sound is the sound of a phone call that didnt go through and is confusing at first if you don't know what's happening.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"Since I am retired I do not travel as much as I used to.  I wanted noise canceling headphones that would not break the bank.  I found this in the Cowin E7 headphones and got what I was looking for.  They made a big difference in the noise level on a recent flight to Ireland.  I was amazed to hear the difference in the engine noise when I turned them off.  In addition they are very comfortable to wear.  They may not say Bose on the side, but they are a lot less expensive and do a great job.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"The noise cancellation is not very good on these, but it does help compared to headphones without it. Without playing music, they remove low hum and rumble (like loud AC or an airplane). You can very easily hear people talking with or without music playing. The sound is surprisingly good for the price. I don’t think these will last forever either, if I sat on these then they’d probably break. Overall, great value for some cheap NC’s you wouldn’t mind losing on a trip or sitting on at work.",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0

"I originally purchased these in July 2018, and I fell in love! The cushions on the earpieces as well as on the headband are unbelievably cushy; I can wear them for hours without getting uncomfortable. Not to mention that the battery can last me for two-three weeks until it needs to be charged again (and I use these things a lot). After a year of typical use, one of the swivels on the earpieces broke. I emailed customer service and they got back to me very quickly. They sent me a code for a free replacement pair. (The cushions on the new pair feel a bit stiffer than my last pair; I'm not sure if they need to be broken in or that's just how the headphones are). I'd definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some wireless headphones at an affordable price!",5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"These headphones are fantastic! Audio is very clear and there's good bass too. Best of all, they sit comfortably and I can wear them for long periods of time since the padding around the ears is so thick and soft. I can easily wear these headphones for 3-4 hours at a time while studying. The way they are designed blocks out a lot of sound passively but the ANC is a nice bonus. Switching between the two you can tell that the ANC can block out more subtle background noise like cars passing in the street or AC and vents humming.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
They don't work well with my Samsung TV. I have to do a hard reset on my TV or listen to poor reception. Hard reset is hard on my TV to get good reception. Have yet to decide whether keep or send back. I am tired of buying and having to return cycle.I guess the newer bluetooth sets don't work for my TV. I think very important to let non electronic people know a little more on facts. Very unhappy,4,1,2020-1-9,1,1,0

"I'm no audiophile, but I have owned more expensive pairs of headphones. In my opinion, these have comparable (but probably still a little worse) sound quality to a pair of Bose headphones I used to own that cost at least twice as much and lacked active noise cancelling. They probably wouldn't sound good enough for a serious audiophile, but I don't think audiophiles are the targeted consumers for these headphones anyway.The noise cancelling feature is cool as long as you have realistic expectations. By itself the active noise cancelling won't block absolutely everything, but it certainly has made loud construction outside my window much more bearable. Music doesn't sound as rich or ""full"" when the noise cancelling is on, but I usually don't use it with music anyway. The itself music does a better job blocking noise. I could see noise cancelling for listening to music on a plane but I haven't flown since buying these. One small negative is that active noise cancelling only works with bluetooth, so if you're listening via cable you can't use noise cancelling.",4,1,2017-7-12,1,0,0
"So I first heard about these headphones on Youtube.  I was looking at Bose and Sony but I really didn't have $300.00 to spend on headphones.

I have gone to the store and listened to the  Bose and my Cowins sound just as good to me.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,1,0

"i bought these because i needed another pair while we're working from home during this quarantine. i am pleased with the sound quality. The biggest issue i have with them is that they always use battery power, even when you're listening with just the aux cord and not bluetooth. All my other pairs do not do this. And you cannot use them while they are charging. If i had caught these features prior to buying them, i honestly probably would not have purchased them as that is highly inconvenient. It's my own fault though for not reading everything thoroughly.",2,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
After a year my E7 right headphone base had worn down and detached. I reached out the Cowin customer service team about this issue and let's just say I'm 110% satisfied with the experience.

"I liked these long as they worked. I bought them November 2018 and they lasted until now, August 2019. Sound was good, noise cancellation useful for public transportation / airplanes, comfortable, and price was great.  The only consistent problem I had was with Bluetooth connection. Now however, the audio sounds like inside of a fish bowl. They did mean well, but after about 6 months of heavy use (before that I used them occasionally) they're having issues. I prefer the sound of my 15$ Panasonic earbuds now that the sound on my cowin headphones is compromised.

Wasn't sure about the controls after reading some of the reviews for this and other brands, but they seem to work just fine.  Comfortable to wear for both me and my husband-look and feel great.. Phone mic is only OK, but I got them for Air travel so the mic wasn't all that important to me.

This headset connected easily to every Bluetooth enabled device we own.  The sound quality was amazing!  It is like sitting in a movie theater with surround sound full bass and treble response.

"I have a few different pairs of headphones, but these have become my go-to headphones when I want to tune out background noise while working from home, or when I want something comfortable for listening to longer podcasts. I don't own any high-end, expensive noise cancelling headphones, and don't really see a need to with these. The sound quality is not quite amazing, it can be a little muddy, but not bad for the price. It's even OK for practicing guitar (with the cable plugged in, to reduce latency).",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I had a problem with the headphones after dalily use for 6 months.  I was in love with this headset. It failed to take a charge. I wrote a note to the seller through Amazon and within hours I received a response back from the seller offering me a ""free"" replacement because I was still covered under warranty. I am so glad I purchased these headphones. I have two friends that in the market for some for themselves. They will be placing an order within the weeks end. Great headset and GREAT company. Get some for yourself.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
I mean sadly people around me can hear very clearly what I'm listening to the ears coverage is a but small but the bass and sound is okay. Battery life is amazing I've gone 8 hours and still using them....Con: even with an auxielry cable u still need to turn the headphones power on.. most headphones will just work with auxiliary cable even if their off... but this ones u must turn on...,5,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
I've tried several headphones in this budget range and these are by far the best. Great audio fro the price and really noise cancelling with the volume up. They don't cancel out all noice without at least 1/2 volume but better than most in this price range. I've had them for a few months now and the battery still last 24+ hours of use. Bluetooth connects easily and they come with a cord.,5,1,2019-5-3,1,0,0
"If you are like me you have purchased many ""cheap"" headphones and been disappointed by something about them.  These were a welcome surprise, they did not disappoint. These are inexpensive headphones that have excellent sound, solid construction, and incredibly long battery life.I bought these to use at work and help me concentrate. I charged them the first time and got to the end of the first week and I realized that I had not charged them once that week and they were still going strong.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,1
"The best thing about these has to be the comfort, a close second is how easy they are to use, a close third is how good they sound.  You would think that sound quality would be the highest priority but what good is that if it's a pain to pare the headphones or if they hurt your ears after only an hour of wearing them?I have three really good headphones on my desk and these are by far the ones I reach for first.",5,1,2018-9-1,1,0,0
"I LOVE these, I work from home over the computer for work and wear headphones all day, I have been looking for something that doesn't bother my ears and yet the mic function works well.

I have not bought him wireless headphones before because the need for managing the battery (he tends to forget).  Since the battery life in these is so good, this hasn't been an issue.  He loves them.",5,1,2019-7-9,1,0,0
"For customer service only, I gave it a three. I didn't get a chance to even try these headphones. When I opened the package, the smell of petroleum was so strong that I had to put it tirht back and return it. This is the first product I've ever had that caused such a reaction. I have no trouble pumping gas, but this was like being in a rubber factory--but worse. Very disappointing; I really wanted these to work. I was able to return them, which I do appreciate.",3,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"I wanted a noise canceling headset for air travel since i had to crank my ear bud volume up to be able to listen to music or watch movies.  The Crowin E7s comes with an audio cord to connect directly with the airplane entertainment system.  I as use the Bluetooth function with my tablet.  A word of advice is to connect Crowin E7 to your Bluetooth device at home rather than right before takeoff like I tried.  Haha, I could not find the E7 amongst the 250 other Bluetooth devices everyone else brought on board.  I was greatful for the hard wire audio connection from the E7 to my tablet.  Another added benefit was the noise canceling muted out the screeching kid three rows back. :-)",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"Definitely worth buying. For the price it provides a very good audio quality. Yes, they are not so comfortable and much bulkier than Bose QC35, but they 5-6 times cheaper. I just was not able to justify the high price of the Bose (plus, there are many reviews that they are not very reliable), and I didn’t have much expectations for Cowin, but they surprised me a lot. Glad that bought it. And I had $15 in gift cards, so I got it for even less.",5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0

And by the way, the blue color is awesome.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"The active noise cancelling is not true. If this feature is present at all its not very effective. The ear cushions are comfortable and I haven’t gotten the headphones tangled in my hair, which was the only problem for my previous headphones. I find it super cheap that you turn it on and off with a switch. It makes it really easy to leave them on and kill the battery. They work, just not the same quality that was advertised. I could get something else for less money and get the same product performance.",3,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0

"Very classy clean lines.  Sound quality is better than ear buds, not like $300 versions, but who cares!  Very comfortable, not for use during activity -- more for easy-chair / bedtime enjoyment.  Size adjustments are quick and firm.  Control placement is easy to reach and remember without having to look.  Noise Cancellation feature does what is advertised -- almost completely blocks TV audio in same room.  Battery life seems good. BlueTooth works as expected.  I have hearing loss in only one ear, so a built-in ""balance control"" would be nice.  In my wildest dreams, an SDHC socket with internal MP3 player, and separate frequency equalization (4 or 5 band) for each channel would let me tailor it for my particular hearing loss. Just a suggestion to the COWIN folks for upgrades or another model.  Overall very pleased, and the price can't be beat for the features.",4,1,2017-7-24,1,1,0
"I was somewhat cautious about purchasing these headphones because of the price point.  However, these headphones are very comfortable, well made and the sound quality is amazing.

But, as I was returning to school and I knew it would be Zoom-heavy, I thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and finally buy some decent headphones. Holy cow! I didn't know that the music I had been listening to was so complex and bassy. My Zoom calls are now crystal clear and everyone hears me just fine. My workspace is near a window air conditioner and the sound of it is completely gone when I turn on the noise cancelling feature. How have I lived for so long with such sub-par sound quality?",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"Noise canceling was ok, it was enough to remove the sound of my fridge and computer across the room but anything louder came though.

"I work at an animal shelter and purchased these for morning cleaning of the kennels. Imagine 30-60 dogs barking loudly nonstop for two hours. It can drive any person a little insane. I was using normal headphone (in ear) and they were fine but I could still hear the doggos. I tried these bad boys out today. While I could still hear the barking, it wasn’t as loud. I was actually able to listen to my podcasts and hear the words being spoken (couldn’t with just in ear headphones). The E7’s aren’t too heavy or tight- if they were tighter, they would probably cancel out more of the noise but would hurt or get super sweaty. I personally like them, does what I wanted them to do so I’d recommend them. So what to remember, won’t cancel out noise 100% but does a decent job for the price.",4,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0

However, these headphones don't seem to cancel noise all that well; helps, but can still hear people talking etc. Also, I wish it had some indication of how much charge was left.Overall, for $50 though, these are great. The sound quality if fine, they are comfortable, and seem sturdy. Would buy again.",4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0

I use them primarily at the gym to listen to audiobooks, so I’m probably not the typical user, but they help block the sound of the spin class instructor who blasts his music all over the workout area.

"These are good! My problem is with Bluetooth connection. And, it could be operator error; I get that.

so I saw the reviews and got them battery life is great build quality good the sound is great if you are not moving or swaying if you tilt your head it makes slight a sound that sounds like a retro video game shooting effect which is annoying after a while and it's not like I'm rocking out it's something as simple as turning your head or walking so keep that in mindUPDATED: After contacting customer support they helped me with resolving my issue and were very kind and helpful in their response and are sending out a replacement,5,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0
"These headphones have saved my productivty on the job. I have heavy road construction going on just a few yards from my office and when I wear them, they elimnate nearly all the noise. I also wore them at work for four straight work days on a single charge, so the battery life is excellent. It has bern a bit of an adjustment with getting used to wearing them while working, but this has gotten easier with each passing day. Finally, the sound quality is excellent. They are a well-made, effective alternative to brands that are many times more expensive.",5,1,2018-11-25,1,0,0
"As someone always looking for a quality product that doesn't break the bank like some of the bigger name brands and models, I stumbled across these headphones. I have owned them for over a year and can say I am really happy with how they have held up and the sound quality. The noise cancelling works well. The ANC, weight, and comfort isn't quite as great as something like BOSE, but for a fifth of the price it's hard to beat. The battery life is really impressive and for something I use at work everyday I have yet to see a hit on the battery life performance in over a year. Would highly recommend.",5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0

Headphones do a very good job of canceling outside noises. Individual ear cups swivel for better fitting and comfort. Sound quality is great. Connection to my computer via bluetooth was very simple.

"The sound quality on these is great. They're also extremely comfortable. Noise cancellation is perfect for me, but it might not be strong enough for people looking to completely drown out the outside world when their headphones are on. The cherry bomb red color also looks really slick. I have two minor complaints. They can only be connected to one thing at a time. If you connect them to your phone, then decide you want to connect them to your computer you'll have to completely erase its presence on your phone. Also, I wish the band was a little wider so that they could fit around my neckorr comfortably.",4,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0

The packaging is beautiful and customer support is excellent.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
I saw all the great reviews and was excited to try these out. Im not sure if i just have higher expectations but these headphones are terrible. They feel very cheap. no options or app. The noise cancelling makes weird popping noises if the cord isnt just right. Also the volume is much lower compared to a normal pair of ear buds i got from samsung. not worth the 50 bucks in my oppinion.,1,1,2020-1-7,1,2,0

The light comes on when the noise canceling function is turned on but it doesn't turn on normally (no chime), will not connect to existing paired devices or new devices.

The noise-canceling is good for low frequencies but does not really cancel sound. It dampens it. The set looks and feels like it was made with higher quality plastics. I recommend this headphone for casual use. Not for running. I used it while weightlifting once and it was comfortable but the earpiece got very sweaty. Overall, good product.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
This is an amazing headset for the price. I have a Bose with a wire that doesn't work with my phone. This one is just as comfortable and just as noise cancelling with excellent sound.

"Excellent Bass, Clean Mid Tones and a Clear Treble. I use the Cowin E7's for wireless sound from my steaming server that carries everything from simple TV audio to 7.1 Surround sound. They do an amazing job handling all of these sources easily. The ability of these headphones to noise cancel is as good as units costing hundreds of dollars more. The E7's are comfortable to wear and the controls are conveniently located. The cherry on the cake is the battery system. I use mine every day and depending on the length of use, I regularly go three days between charges. I would challenge anyone to find another product that comes close to the E7's quality, in this price range.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0

Noise isolation is great, Low and atmospheric sounds are muffled with out any statics. This lightweight  headphone fits on my head so well.  I do not feel squished at all after hours of wearing. For less than  $70,  it's definitely worth the buy.",5,1,2018-1-6,1,0,0

Most rinks I have access to don't play the music I'd normally skate to, and I was wanting something that would for the most part shut the sound out at the rink while not emptying a chunk out of my wallet.These work great. Connecting is simple, sound quality is great, and the bass is nice. I will say though there's a point at which there is too much bass and it overpowers the song a bit if you have these turned all the way up. So I just keep them a little under max volume.",4,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0

(NOT COWIN) Then I ordered the E7 and it feels great, sounds amazing, and has a sleek look about it. It feels like I'm carrying around something durable when I wear them instead of a hunk of junk plastic.If I have to point out any cons then the mic isn't the best thing in the world and the noise cancellation feature seems to be reversed on the switch I think. Also I'm able to use it for my xbox one with a cable to listen to the console however the mic feature doesnt work with it even if you have a mic cable.

After running into this I researched it a bit and it seems this is a common issue with bluetooth headsets, so if you plan to use the mic make sure to buy a wired headset instead.If you dont plan on using the mic, I will say the audio quality is good imo, its not the most comfortable headset but you can wear it for long periods of time, the noise cancelling works a bit but definitely nothing spectacular.  After about a year of fairly light usage the headset is now breaking down on me, the audio while using bluetooth keeps cutting in and out.  Can use the wired connection for sound but the cord is pretty short so doesnt really work with my desk layout.",2,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
This is my third pair of headphones.  The  sound is great as is noise blocking.

I'm not a person that can stand earbuds but this is the best over the ear headset that I have owned.  I gave the noise cancelling a 3 because I have not had the opportunity to really test it out.

Either way, I can't use them for the device.Now on to the good stuff! The sound quality is great. I like the noise-canceling feature. I've had headphones that cancel the noise out more, but I think the amount on these headphones is sufficient and safer. The headphones aren't designed to stay on my head with my crazy dancing, but the durability is on point! I've done head whips and seen the headphones go flying more times than I'd like to admit, yet there's been no damage. If you're in the market for something durable and affordable, I'd recommend these headphones.",4,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"The sound is amazing, the bass is great, and they are great without the noise cancelling.  They fit well,m snug and they stay  that way during activity. I wear them working around the yard.  The distance you can get from your device is a bit limited, however the batter life far outweighs that.  The battery life, so far, four days of normal use and it's still going strong. I've been working in the garage, outside fighting leaves and the like.  Perfect anti nagging device, can't hear a word the wife says when I have them on.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
I've done a ton of research and landed on this headset and it drastically improved quality of my work calls/meetings during WFH period. My team members immediately noticed how much more clearly I sound. I am also quite impressed with the battery life and with how quickly it charges. And the color selection is amazing. I picked white and the look is very sleek.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
These are excellent headphones at an amazing low price. The only things I found that could be improved is the following. It would be nice to know the percentage battery left instead of just a light. They are somewhat heavy and hot but not too bad. The bass is overextended. But they are excellent and well worth the money.,5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
Wow. Just WOW!  Sound quality and comfort. These I never heard of until last week. Gave them a shot and LOVE them talk about nice!!  The packaging is superior and I really like the comfy part that goes on your head. I was going to spend $200 on the other big brands but was money conscious to try these. Saved almost $150 and glad I did.,5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"I purchased 3 sets for our technology team.  I really wanted to like these but I don't.  Two of the 3 sets are not working.  The 2 not working are being used with Macs running Mojave.  When we connect with bluetooth the audio so choppy that you can't even make out full words.  When we try to talk with the audio, we cannot be heard.  We've check the sound output and input settings on our computers to make sure the headphones are selected, which they are.  If we use the audio cable, the sound is great.  However, we can't use the microphone and we're not wireless which was on things I was looking for in this purchase.  The one set that is working is being used on a PC and bluetooth works perfectly.  I didn't see anything in the description stating you can only use these with a PC.",3,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"I bought headphones for my husband as a gift.  He's a big music and podcast listener.  He LOVES them.  He works in a big warehouse environment and with the noice cancelling, he is able to listen without all of the background noise. They hold a charge for the whole day.  He can even get by charging them other day.  Excellent quality and comfortable. It's easy for him to answer the phone while using them as well.  His only complaint is that the reach is not as far as the specs say.  Would definitely recommend them.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"After my Bose broke, I wasn't prepared to drop a wad on replacement Bose headphones, so settled on these in a pinch.  I have been generally impressed so far.  Sound and noise cancelling are good as is battery life.

"I used the first one I purchased for over a year before I misplaced it.  I bought the second one because I liked the first  one.  Now I have 2, one paired to my computer, the other paired to my tablet.  They pair easy on Blue Tooth so now I am able to just turn them on to ""BT"" and start using.  Good comfortable product.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I bought these for a recent trip. Did some research and these were highly rated for under $100. I couldn’t justify spending more than that for something I don’t use regularly.On the airplane, they muffled the ambient sound, but voices you can still hear. If you turn the volume up enough, it does a pretty good job of drowning out most sound.",3,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
"I liked the sound quality on these as well as the noise-cancellation. Wore them on a recent 2 hour flight and they nicely cancelled out the drone of the engines. Given the price, these were a steal. Where they fell short was in the comfort department. The ear ""cans"" were too small and ended up pinching the top of my ears. I could manage a couple hour flight but there's no way I'd want to wear them for much longer. I don't think I have particularly big ears so unless yours are small, I'd think twice about purchasing.Review edit: customer service reached out to me and sent me a pair of the SE7s (a step up). Definitely an improvement in comfort. Also A-plus for customer service!",4,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"Much better than earbuds that I've been using for all of my travels as they hurt my ears after long periods of use. I've been looking to get a nice pair of over the ear headsets for a while, but I did not want to spent hundreds of dollars. So far these are everything I was looking for; they are very comfortable and feel great around my ears, nor do my ears hurt after using them. I have not used them on a plane yet, but the sound quality is also very, very good. These are an excellent value.",4,1,2019-7-24,1,1,0
"I’ve had these for a few years and they only broke today. I’m disappointed that they broke, but they lasted plenty long and I think I probably got my money’s worth. The noise cancellation works well, it doesn’t block everything of course so don’t expect that. The sound quality is good as well, and they’re mostly very durable, Just be careful with the rotating parts connecting the top band to the earpiece, that’s what snapped for me. I’m not certain yet but I think I may get another one.",5,1,2020-6-5,1,1,0
I used the headphones right out of the box to listen to the TV via bluetooth. They replaced another set that wore out. The setup via bluetooth was automatic.  The sound quality was excellent.I did not purchase them for the noise cancellation ability but noted that background sounds in my home are muted vs the previous set.,5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"I've bought two of these headphones. The sound quality is pretty good and I've found it to be a somewhat comfortable fit. However, after wearing my most recent one for several months, the metal frame started coming apart, so I had to hold it together with a piece of tape. After that, the left ear popped out of its socket, so I can't use it anymore. This is the second one I bought, and my first one broke in a similar way. I'm done buying them.",2,1,2019-11-23,1,2,0
"I RECEIVED BETTER THAN EXPECTED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEREFORE HAVE UPDATED MY RATING.  I was not fully satisfied but the seller made it right.I wasnt expecting voices to be muted, but other ambient noise still hangs around.  Unfortunately I am past the return window otherwise I would return, I was not able to try them out on a plane until recently, and they were not that good at all.  Yes, they brought the sound of the plane down alot, but too much was still there.  Sound quality is decent though.  I do hear some buzzing sound some complain about.",4,1,2019-2-24,1,0,0
"I have a 40-80 DB hearing impairment in one ear and have never been able to enjoy stereo music, until now!  The unit has wonderful acoustics and drowns out most of the surrounding noise.  It is a bit bulky to take on a trip, even though it comes with a leather case and charger.  I can relax at home in my easy chair and just chill to my tunes in the evenings.  After an hour or so, it can be a bit uncomfortable, so adjust accordingly your listening time.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
A pretty good purchase for the price I paid for it these headphones to me is very affordable rather than the more expensive brands like beats or some of the other selling in the headset market.  It up to you if you can afford to pay over $200-$400 or better for headsets especially if your not working in the recording studio as a professional!!!,5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"Any other noise canceling headphone is about a hundred dollars or more.  These really work.  The first time was when using a compressor and air tools, what a difference.  I took these off around mid-flight and really noticed how loud the airplane noise is.  Sound quality is good.",5,1,2018-12-5,1,1,0
We bought two pair and used them flying. They worked beautifully and made the long cross country flight quiet and entertaining- with an Iphone and with the airline movies. I had a problem with one set and Jack at Cowin replaced it right away. Would definitely buy these again.,5,1,2017-12-4,1,0,0
"These do not cancel noise, maybe dull it out a little when you have something playing in them. So the same outcome as any other headphones. They are good headphones though.

"These headphones look great. The buttons looked intimidating but one read through the short easy to read user manual and I got the hang of it.The sound quality from the headphones were fantastic. I found myself enjoying my music alot more than just using earbuds. Although this product comes with a mic, I used it for phone calls and online chat on the first day and I was told that the mic quality wasn't the best. But it was usable.",5,1,2018-1-22,1,0,0
"I used this product recently in a flight. It was amazing how loud it was every time I took off my headphones. They really cancelled a lot of sound! We were behind the wing, so it was especially loud. They are very comfortable, held a good charge, and were easy to sync and keep synced. I'm so glad I got these! 6 hour flight to Hawaii will be their next test!",5,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"Wow, these headphones are amazing especially for the price. It's just so dangerous how high the volume can get and it really does help you tune out the rest of your surrounding noise.

cant get the bluetooth to sync with computer cant get the wireless to work  i have to use the cord  plug in it sucks  look for something more simpler  have to go through all this work just to get wireless  and blue tooth to work ? this is not worth it  do not buy thses dont get fooled buy the pretty colors they come in.,2,1,2019-8-20,1,1,0
Disappointed in the sound quality - there's even a static - having issue with syncing to phone - supposedly synced - but I am not hearing anything. I could just be spoiled from prior earphones - sound was great and had no issues with syncing - took right away - and always reconnecting without any problems.  Debating whether to return - it's just been one day.,3,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I'm not a headphone connoisseur, but I do enjoy music.  Specifically, I like to enjoy music while the person next to me is watching TV loudly. For this purpose, these headphones are fantastic. I can't hear the TV at all, and the quality of the music is outstanding. It sounds like you're actually there. There's a surround sound aspect to it. They're truly phenomenal and I've already recommended them to friends.",5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
I got these as a gift for my brother in law. We all got to listen to them over the Christmas break and they made it onto everyone's wish list. THIS is how music should be listened to. Amazing. Fantastic noise cancellation too. We were all very impressed. I was a little nervous buying a brand I had never heard of - but ended up returning the Sony ones I bought and keeping these.,5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"There are three settings off on and active noise cancellation.  The headphones sound great. Battery life is excellent, fit is great.  Unfortunately I can’t tell any difference between either of the sound settings.  They do a decent job of keeping out the noise but I can still hear.  If the noise cancellation is working I can’t tell.  Still decent for the price",3,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
The product arrived on time and when it came the packaging it was in was awesome! They have a clean high quality look and feel and any questions about quality sound are quickly answered as soon as you turn them on! I was moved to tears (literally)  at how well these sound!When using them for phone calls you can hear the person loud and clear! There is no issues with the microphone rubbing against anything and making any uncomfortable noises for you or the caller. I have bought hundreds of headphones over the years (again literally) and I will never buy another set again! The only small thing I would recommend is making the distance longer for the Bluetooth if you leave your phone down in the same room your fine but if you go much more then that then the sound starts to get  interrupted. This isn’t a huge deal but for some it is. Again it’s a small issue.,5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
"Easy to connect to my phone. Quality is great, not same as my Beats Studio but very close.  I would recommend these over my Beats or any others I've had.  Comfort, Connectivity, sound are all superb.  The reason this is not a 5 star review is volume and track control in head phones.  The same buttons for volume up and down are same.to move track forward and back. Functions separated by length of press.  Make these separate buttons and these are 5 star all day long.",4,1,2017-8-3,1,1,0
"Worked for 3 months and then stopped holding a charge. Red light turns on when plugged in and then turns off after 10 sec.

I wanted a pair of noise-canceling headphones that didn't break the bank and these are great. I'd never used noise-canceling headphones and thought it would completely silence everything but rather it seems to kind of softly mute most noises.

"This is my new buff. Originally, it was for my morning walks, I needed something to really cancel out sounds, cars, ppl when I was in higher than normal traffic (not on my trail). It was the key!

Ear buds do not stay in my ear so I need something that goes over them. These are great headphones for the price and stay put while running and working out.

They are comfortable, provide excellent sound, and were quickly recognized when synching with my LG smart tv or IPhone. I also enjoy the noise cancelling feature. I was skeptical of this feature at first, but it really does reduce ambient sounds. Great battery life; easily met the 30 hours advertised. The only drawback, and it is based only on one experience, is with the microphone. I was told that my voice sounded fuzzy when using it with my IPhone on a telephone call.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0

They sound great, they feel good, and they pair so easily with my iphone.  They were super easy to setup and work like all other bluetooth items that I have.  They feel really good even after wearing them for a few hours.  I don't get that 'sweaty' ear wetness that you can get from some headphones.  They seem to breathe really nicely and are very comfortable for long stretches.  They only minor downside is that the music does bleed out at higher volumes but that's pretty common.  I won't knock any stars off for that.  All around a great choice!",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Headphone pads are soft & I can wear them for hours without any problems. Sound is great & I didn't have to play around with my equalizer settings to find the ideal sound mix.

They did exactly what I was hoping, I love these and they were very affordable.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
I purchased these for a 10+ hour flight I had.  They worked really well.  These were the first noise canceling headphones I’ve tried so I’m not sure how they compare but I was very impressed.  The Bluetooth worked well with my iPhone but they also come with a 3.5 chord that I used to connect to the in flight entertainment system.  I used them non-stop for my 10+ hour flights plus connecting flight and still had battery life left.  They are comfortable on my ears.  The only drawback is the built in controls do work but aren’t super intuitive but that’s a minor complaint.  I will never take a long flight without noise canceling headphones again if I can help it.,5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"My wife implored me to get her some BT headphones to alleviate the boredom of mowing our acreage. Decided on this pair because of the active noise cancellation. So far we like them. With no song playing and the mower running, I compared the noise cancellation against a pair of Mpow safety ear muffs with 36 dB of SNR. The E7 seemed to deaden the mower sound about the same as the safety muffs.CONS: They don't look particularly rugged for outdoors work, but they have held up OK after 10 hours of mowing. My wife complains that they slip down a bit, but she has a small head.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
I have had these head phones for about 3 months.  I wear them when I  mow grass and they are great! I dont hear the mower and my music comes through with great sound. The battery life is also great. I have only charged my head phones a couple of times since I have had them.  I usually wear them about 4 hours at a time and they are very comfortable.,5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
I bought these for work. Honestly the sound quality is pretty good. I've been using them for 6 hours now and I have no complaints there.The reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is they feel pretty cheap. The entire body is made of the cheap plastic which is fine but I do question how long they'll stand up to everyday use. Another reason for the lower score is the noise cancellation is horrible. I honestly can't tell a difference between it being on and off. There was even one point in the day today where I thought having the sound cancellation made it easier to hear things around me.,4,1,2017-9-16,1,0,0
"I am IN LOVE with these head phones.  I purchased them specifically to cancel out background noise and they do just that and more - they're comfortable on the ears (thanks to the padding), the balance of sound is perfect that listening to music or sounds is taken to a whole 'nother level, being able to adjust the headphones to fit your ears is a great option, pairing is a synch.  All in all, the ear phones are a work of art to look at - smooth, silver against black, you feel like you're wearing THE most expensive set of head phones made.

If you have a big yard to mow these are great as ride on lawnmower headphones.

The ease to pair these phones is unbelievable. Once you start using them the sound is great.  Much better than then the previous ones.

Is this as good as BOSE?  No.  But it’s a very very close second and if you are comparing price (I have BOSE as well), I would buy this over BOSE because it is a close 2nd and the price is much much better than BOSE.

The E8s are supposed to be even better. I may upgrade to those when these are done.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
These sound great for the price and I am very happy with them...well insulated from the world but the digital noise cancellation is lacking. I bought them to use when working on my tractor and lawn mower. They block out as much sound in BT as the do in NC mode. Overall I am happy though and would purchase again.,3,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I've had these since November 2017 and wanted to wait a bit before writing a review so that I could get a true feel of these. Without question, these are one of the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. Sound quality is excellent. Noise cancellation meets my needs. And the battery life simply blows my mind! For their size, I find them to be comfortable and light weight. I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a quality set of headphones at a reasonable price.",5,1,2018-2-16,1,0,0
"These are great! Sound is wonderful, noise cancelling is very good, and battery life is 5 stars! I bought 3 pair for a trip from TX to Maui and they were a life saver! Besides great sound and bass, and noise cancelling, the battery life was great - i'm pretty sure I could have done round trip and not have charged these! Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
"This is by far the best deal on headphones in a time where all these ridiculously overpriced “brands” are thriving due to sheepdom. Noise cancellation is great, sound is great, sometimes when its hot (in Florida) I’ll take them off and set them beside me, and still jam out because theyre like a little bluetooth speaker, and the battery???? I fall asleep with them all the time and still use them for hours the next day. They are super underated for the price.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
UPDATE: I love these headphones. The first pair I got had a small defect and the shipper replaced my headset and I couldn’t be happier with the replacement. They sound great! My sister ordered a pair after she’s tried them :)Sounds pretty good. I just don’t like how it sounds like something is loose in the left speaker when I walk. It kind of sounds like something rattling and makes it sound like crap. Idk if I have a defective unit but who knows,5,1,2018-3-8,1,0,0
"The EASE of connection to bluetooth got my attention out of the box! Then, listening  was a sheer delight. Plus I loved the way the manual on-off button makes it so easy to tell that the unit is on and in bluetooth without wondering how to see if it is on. Overall, with the slight exception to the noise canceling feature, I give this unit an ""A"" and would definitely buy it again! - Danny (Atlanta, Ga.)",5,1,2019-6-15,1,1,0
"I don't hate them, but I also dont love them that much to make my favorites. For the price you pay they are actually very decent quality headphones for around home and also on plane. They didnt entirely drown out a crying baby on my plane trip,  but they did an average job. For someone on budget and quickly needed they are a must have. They definitely make me want to upgrade to a better quality.",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"For the price point, these are very durable and reliable headphones. The battery life is quite long for Bluetooth headphones and the sound quality is nice and clear. The noise cancelling isn't as strong as some other headphones on the market, but there's enough of an effect to be worthwhile. The headphones are thankfully made with a metal casing instead of plastic, but aren't so heavy as to be uncomfortable.Be aware that pairing Bluetooth can be a little awkward with these headphones. It pairs just fine, but sometimes there's no beep for feedback to let you know that the process is done. This appears to depend on the device that's being paired with the headphones though and is otherwise consistent.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0

"I had no issues getting these to work.  However, I must update this now to note that the audio level output from the headphone is low and can't be adjusted high enough for my limited hearing.  When I contacted the company, they stated these headphones were not compatible with my Yamaha receiver as an explanation.  In any event they were good enough to refund my money.",4,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
I love these headphones. The battery life is amazing. The only thing I don’t love is they aren’t very noise cancelling even when playing music. I have a pair of bose headphones that plug in and they cancel more noise than these on a plane. Other than that I really like them. My office is noisy and it does cancel that noise out when playing music.,5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
1) The appearance is about a 3 of 5. The light is bothersome when the lights are out. I would recommend making the LED less bright.2)The sound quality is 4 of 5. But definitely degraded with the noise canceling function on. 3 of 5 for that.,4,1,2016-8-27,1,1,0

"I received these headphones and was initially satisfied although the wire included was very noisy and extra cheap.  I didn’t use them for about month and had to go on a trip so I packed them after charging them over night and tried to turn them on and it didn’t work. I tried all the suggestions to get it to work and nothing did,  including the passive connection.  One suggestion was to unplug the battery and plug it back in,  so I opened up the side and the battery has no plugs,  just hard wired.  Biggest disappointment as they were comfortable and I bought the corwin matching case. Do not buy. I regret not buying a name brand.",1,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"I bought 2 of these for my husband and I to use on an overseas flight. I cannot get the noise cancellation to work with my iPad or iphone. Bluetooth connects, but I hear all the ambient noises in the background. Good enough wireless sound, so I kept the one set I tried to get to work and sent the other back. Customer service sent me a trick to try to get it to work step by step, but alas, it didn’t solve the problem. Apple products do not have the NFC  function to use.",2,1,2019-6-28,1,1,0
"Great product for the price: effective noise cancelling (gets rid of the sound of my loud window AC), decent looks and build quality, good battery life.Cons: can be difficult for people to hear you over the mic on a bluetooth call, and they are a bit too large for me to wear them out and about. Tight-ish fit for people with a very large head, but not so much as to cause pain. Not exactly as stylish as Beats, but the price is absolutely right. Extended use means your ears can get a little sweaty.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"Totally false advertising. They are mid-grade wireless Bluetooth headphones. With about a zero noise cancellation rate. Go from being able to hear everything to being able to hear everything with $60 less dollars!

"I am changing my  rating and review.  The 1st pair I received did not work. Once I was able to connect with Cowin they were great about sending me a new pair.  Now I can listen to music through them and the sound is great,  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because of the noise reduction. I have never used any noise reduction so perhaps my expectations are not realistic.  They seem to be great for reducing  ambient background noise but I can still hear voices and TV  sounds.",4,1,2018-4-2,1,0,0
"I have tried different headphones that claim to be noise cancelling, but these are true to their word. Not only is there a comfortable padding around my ears, but the sound quality of my music and school lectures are crisp and clear, not muffled at all. I had my family talking very loud beside me while I studied, and I couldn't hear a thing with these headphones. I should let you guys know that even though they do plug into the computer, you HAVE to charge the headphones prior to be able to use them (being that they are Bluetooth) I don't know if that made sense...Plugging the headphones to the computer does not serve as a charger, you have to charge the headphones in order to use them. If the battery is dead, they would not work, not the sound or the Bluetooth. Overall, I am very, very pleased with this product, and these are perfect for people that need a good quality noise counseling headphones. Thank you Amazon and COWIN:)",5,1,2018-3-13,1,0,0
"The noise cancelling feature is not the best i have seen.  The controls could have been made sturdier.  The head-band could have stretched longer, I wear them on the last notch and it barely fits.  The sound is not remarkable, just average.  However, for the price, it is a good buy.  If I had a little more money I would have bought a better-known model instead.",4,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
A little too much white noise but did a great job for a 6 hour flight. Had some trouble with the blue tooth function connecting but was able to use the aux cord and it didnt drain my phone.  Good value.,5,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
"They’re decent headphones, but the sound is very low. If you connect them to your phone whether it’s Bluetooth or through chord, the other persons voice tends to cut in and out from time to time. I use them to play PlayStation and they’re pretty good when you’re playing a game that you need to only hear the sound in. If people are talking, they game will be drowned out. Having them on for an extended amount of time could cause a really bad inner ear pain. Happens to me and I have tons of headsets that don’t do that. Great for listening to music.",4,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I've had these for about 2 days, I've carried them around for a bit, used them and then it didn't work. I thought that it was out of battery, so I turned it off and plugged it in. The light was blinking red instead of solid. At first, I thought it was strange but I left it plugged overnight and unplugged it today, turned it on and wore it. It didn't connect to my phone. I tried multiple times and I ended up putting it back to the charger while the headset was on. Then the light was solid red. I looked at my phone and saw that it was connected. I put them on to see if any music would play but I got static. I turned the music on and I could still hear the music in the background. This all unfolded in less than an hour.",1,1,2019-7-7,1,1,0

"When I first put these on I could still hear some noises and was initially disappointed that they didn’t cancel all noise BUT as soon as I put music on, even soft music, all outside noises were cancelled. The music quality is excellent and the padding is very comfortable. My husband tried them and now he wants his own pair. I was surprised that these headphones were not more expensive because the quality compares with more expensive ear phones. I would highly recommend these earphones for both noise cancellation and sound quality.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
Hate hate hate. These are so bulky and cheap feeling. I feel like they’re going to snap into 50 pieces if I move wrong. Also the volume is so low! Even blasting too volume I can’t get a decent sound.,5,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0
"With all background noise they add on TV shows and movies to make sound seem real I can't understand what people are saying. When I switch on noise canceling not only does it drown out fan running in room, phone ringing, dogs barking, wife  (so far haven't got into trouble with that)  but most of the added background noise. Let me tell you it brought a smile to my face when I first tried them. Yes on the other setting there is a lot bass. They don't hurt you ears like some other headphones I have owned. For me this is truly a 5 star product.",5,1,2018-12-2,1,1,0

The noise cancellation is still fine but it's a little frustrating when listening to music.Edit: After a few weeks, the sound issues went away (maybe a temporarily poor connection) and the headphones sound great again.

Trust me, I have just compared it to one that sounded like it was under water. These are so comfortable and actually fit over your entire ear. At least mine!

There were gardeners right outside my window with lawnmowers and weed whackers, so I opened my window and put these on with active noise cancelling. I couldn't hear a thing!

"I ordered these headphones to replace my Sony's that broke. I was so sad, but I was excited to find these headphones at such a reasonable price. I figured the quality wouldn't be as great as my Sony ones due to a much lower price point, but I was blown away with how awesome these headphones are! The sound is awesome, they fit great and the padding on the ears and head piece is so comfortable. They even stay on for the most part when I'm doing high impact/intensity workouts, like burpees. The only thing that I don't love is that they are a little bigger than I like, but everything else outweighs this! You will love these headphones if you buy them!",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"My son goes through headphones like crazy, because he listens to music 24/7. He needed a second pair of headphones because he his battery would die on his earbuds everyday. So for his birthday I got a pair of these. He loved them so much I decided to get myself a pair. I use them more for phone calls and listening to audio books, but I do listen to music as well. The sound is phenomenal and the base is quite good. For the price and sound quality you just can't beat them. Also with registration you get a 24 month warranty which is very nice indeed.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Pretty good headphones!  Just perfect for all kinds of music. No disappointments, really solid! Worth the purchase. I wish they were a little itty bit more noise cancelling.

"I needed a pair of affordable but heavy duty over-the-head headphones for class and studying. I found this COWIN E7 pair online that were much more affordable than Bose or Dre Beat headphones, and I have to stay, they work great! I do have a small head, so they tend to slip off when I'm looking down into a book or writing notes, which can be slightly annoying, but not a deal breaker. Otherwise, the sound quality is great, they are somewhat noise canceling, the bluetooth works fine and the battery life is long lasting. Would definitely recommend these headphones!",5,1,2017-10-27,1,0,0
"Gone through countless Bluetooth over ear headphones, these are by far the best.  Using as a remote mic for phone calls not so great, but not why I bought them in the first place.  Note:  after 9 months, the right channel failed for no reason.

"I purchased these headphones about a week ago. They came in a very,  very,  nice box. The headphones came with a great,  soft carrying case. The headphones themselves are professionally kept in a foam environment. The operation use of the headphones are easy as pie. If you wish to use Bluetooth,  simply move the switch to the Bt setting and use your Bluetooth settings to pair your device. NC allows you to use the included cord to connect to devices. The charging I feel is a bit longer than I'd like it but the battery life is great,  the best I've ever seen. The noise cancellation function is beautiful and it really allows for better focus. They're super comfortable and are adjustable. They look amazing and very modern. It is very easy to get smudges all over it though. The sound is amazingly crisp and clear. Great product, would recommend this to both gamers and everyday users.",5,1,2017-10-22,1,1,0
"I ordered this product in 2017 for myself so that I could concentrate in noisy environments. It worked better than anticipated!! In fact, it worked so well that my brother who is a musician asked for a pair for Christmas 2018. He uses them everyday and recently had a small issue in which we needed to contact the manufacturer. The entire conversation lasted 5 min and resulted in a great resolution for us. The representative was calm, clear and the entire process was uncomplicated. I felt understood, supported and appreciated as a customer! Thank you so much Cowin! The product is excellent quality and so is the customer service!",5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0
"Good noise cancelling, especially for the price. It looks amazing and fits great on my (what I like to think of as average) head. They have a good control system with a switch that goes from ""Off -> BT (Bluetooth) -> NC (Noise Cancelling)"" which is much easier to operate than other similar headphones I've used from other companies. Finally, they add a card that says they'll donate $1 for every review written (exactly why I'm writing this review) to UNICEF which is one of the slickest and smartest add campaigns I've ever seen I just have to applaud it. Good job COWIN; good product, good design, good noise cancelling and great add campaign!",4,1,2017-11-18,1,0,0
Really happy with these! My apartment building has been going through major construction during covid-19 epidemic and I’ve been working from home.

"I purchased this pair of headphones due to high volume of positive reviews, mostly highlighting its durability. I have so far enjoyed my experience, they offer good sound isolation and above-average sound quality for its price range. However, the Bluetooth range is shorter than other devices I am used to.The build quality is very good, with a sturdy frame and nice cushioning. Still, I find it uncomfortable to use for periods longer than 3 hours.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

"I have upstairs neighbors that aren't obnoxiously noisy, but when the dude above me is playing video games, it can get annoyingly loud. The floors seem to amplify normal walking from room to room too. Not loud enough to bother complaining to the leasing agency or to ask the people upstairs to take it down a few notches, but just enough to keep me constanty second-guessing whether or not I should. So I was on the fence about if I should bite the bullet with an expensive Bose headphones or should I go with the Corwin. I rolled the dice with the Corwin and it worked out really well. So well that I'm writing this review, which I'm usually too lazy and/or easily distracted to do. So this  is the exception.The Corwin headphones did EXACTLY what I hoped they would. In my case, when I flipped the switch from regular ol' BT (bluetooth) to ANC (active noise cancellng), it was like magic. It eliminated all of the bassy, pulsing, ambient noise made by the upstairs neighbor's sound system and a lot of their footsteps too. Huge relief. They worked as advertised and I didn't have to drop a bundle on the Bose. I'm 110% positive the Bose perform great but are they really worth the price? I would have paid that much to drown out the noise from my neighbors. Thankfully, I didn't have to because in my situation, they worked out great.",5,1,2017-11-15,1,0,0
"I decided that I needed some really effective noise cancelling headphones to keep my cortisol levels down when my family members watch their favorite t.v. shows (almost every program, commercial, movie, etc. seems to be designed to induce maximum stress response, not to mention (though I am) the elderly family members who are hard of hearing and have to listen to everything at stadium concert level). Now I can pretty much block out most of the sound from their shows, while also getting to enjoy more calming podcasts or music through my headphones, which blocks the unwanted sounds from around me even more effectively. These seemed like a splurge for me, but now I see them as essential to my well-being.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"As a frequent flyer, I really need good noise cancelling headphones. These work very well. The sound is excellent.

"I've been looking for a quality pair of noise cancelling headphones for a while now. The problem that I find is that higher name brands want a very high price for their headsets.

I was very surprised by the quality and sound of this product and how well built their headphones are put together. They are easy to use and have a good weight to them. I highly recommend COWIN and I will be purchasing another pair very soon!",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
They're not Bose or Sennheiser. But for the money they work quite well. I had another pair of inexpensive ANC phones but I couldn't use them because the ANC destroyed the equalization.

"So I decided to give the Cowin E7 headphones a try since they had so many good reviews and I quickly found out that they were worth it.  I think they are very reasonably priced for wireless headphones with noise cancellation and when I received them I quickly discovered that they were easily the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever owned.  I'm no audiophile or anything, but I felt like the sound quality was excellent.  The noise cancellation made long drives much more enjoyable and worked well on an airplane as well.  The battery life is so ridiculously long that I almost forget to charge it since it lasts all week.After about 8 months of daily use, it kinda died and wouldn't connect anymore.  I got in contact withe Cowin's customer support team and they helped me with basic troubleshooting and when that didn't work, sent me a replacement.  I'm so glad that there wasn't a long convoluted repair and replacement process like what I was expecting and my new unit has been working perfectly.  I'll end with saying that the E7 proved to me that Cowin knows how to make a good product and their customer support team being able to quickly and painlessly resolve my issue is why I'll probably keep buying from Cowin in the future.",5,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0

"I've had these for just a couple of months now. At first they were pretty decent. Well-worth the money. The noise cancellation works great for low rumbles (like airplane engines, subway trains, traffic), but not so much for mids or highs. Which is fine.My issue is that after just a few months, the headphones now sound TERRIBLE. They sound garbled and static-y, as if the bitrate is WAY too low. I've tested other headphones and speakers, and even different phones and computers. I don't know why, but the sound quality absolutely tanked. And I always keep them in their protective bag when not in use.",1,1,2019-5-24,1,1,0

The sound is great when the headphones aren't cutting out, and battery life is fantastic for all day use.I did try the Cowin E9 headphones and they have zero bluetooth lag, better sound, and far superior noise cancellation.  Basically, skip the E7, and spend the extra money on the E9's.",3,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0

Enough noise cancelling to make plane trips easy, and cuts out weird noises and background talking in the office so I can concentrate and work.The customer service was amazing!

So far this is the second headset. The first paired up with my tv however the sound only came out of one side. Thinking that this was a defective headset I returned to Amazon.

Ordered these for work because it is very loud in the factory so the noise canceling works great and the sound quality is very good. The materials used are nice and solid not cheap feeling . Soft leather on ear muffs are a plus. I work a 12 hour shift and I still had plenty of battery life at the end of work.  I'm very happy with these headphones. They also come with a carry bag.

I used it on two very long 14+ hr international flights and thats where the included audio cable came in handy when my phone died and I had to connect it to the in flight entertainment. Buttons are easy to use. They don't include a carrying case with these but since the speaker portion folds flat, I went to the dollar store and picked up a cheap tablet sleeve that this fits perfectly in when folded.

These are heavier than other headphones I've used, but it's not so much to be annoying.  I haven't run the battery down yet, but I think I've used them over ten hours since I topped up the battery.The noise cancelling feature has a side effect.  It feels like a pressure in my head, almost headache inducing.  Playing music reduces this effect but doesn't eliminate it.",4,1,2017-4-4,1,0,0
"Sound was great deep bass and noise cancelling is some of the best I've experienced. I would recommend these headphones to anyone who cares about sound quality and noise cancelling. Construction is great, very durable and they look fantastic, have had comments on the styling alone not to mention the sound quality. Best headphone purchase I've made in a long time.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0
"Excellent for the price. I bought a bose first and the main difference is the bose is lighter, noise cancelling and microphone are noticably superior. However you can buy 4 of these for the price of 1 bose. For me the trade of in price was a no brainer and this is a good product. Also the customer service is amazing. A piece of my headphones cracked after 6 months and they replaced the whole headset right away. Im very happy with this overall.",5,1,2019-7-27,1,1,0
"I originally bought this product for its noise canceling abilities. I needed something to block out the noise around the house while I studied and did schoolwork. The headphones are super comfortable and have a really good noise canceling ability. Plus, the sound quality when you play music, podcasts, etc. is great! My only criticism is its connection quality to other devices besides an smart phone. Most of the time the connection is pretty decent. However, at times the connection to my laptop was poor. I could hear subtle white noise in the background and the headphones would completely disconnect randomly.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I've been using the headphones for my computer almost every day for over a over half a year now, the sound quality is decent, the battery lasts a long time, connection is easy.Active Noise Cancelling is not the best I've had, but then the price is nowhere near the good brands.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"We received a replacement unit after we attempted to remove the battery cover and couldn't get it off. Sound quality and noise cancellation effect are great. Although the battery cover on second unit appears to be the same as the first and looks like it is NOT designed to be removed. So when it comes time to replace the batteries, I suppose the unit will be trash at that time. If the battery cover is designed to be removed for battery replacement, a video tutorial or detailed instructions with the unit would be helpful.",5,1,2018-2-24,1,0,0
I am not much of a judge of sound quality since I have a hearing problem but I can understand the words to songs very well and background noise is almost eliminated in the gym. I really like them and I can’t imagine I would like more expensive ones any better. The price is what caught my eye. I didn’t want to spend a couple hundred dollars for Bose. They are bulky but that is what I like about them. They are not uncomfortably bulky and they stay in place because they are adjustable. Even though I bought them in black I liked that they came in different colors.,5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"I wanted these as a high school graduation gift before I headed off to college, as I wanted to be able to study in my dorm if I wanted to. Well, it's finals season, and these babies have blocked out people charging up and down hallways, screaming babies on trains and planes, the noise of the student union (and for some reason library?), and a movie my roommate was watching. The charge lasts FOREVER (I still haven't recharged them! I got them in June!), the sound quality is great, and the noise cancellation works about as well as it can. You really can't beat these for the price!",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"Great headphones for the price. The battery life was outstanding and the call feature worked well. I did have an issue early on with a static sound when the noise cancelling was turned on. This turned out to be from moisture, especially when wearing them shortly after showering.The headphones broke near the swivel after 14 months of use. Considering this was essentially constant, everyday use, I don't feel it was premature.",4,1,2018-4-21,1,2,0
My husband ordered these headphones for me. We both use them. The sound quality is incredible! The battery life is quite long. I have literally charged them 3 times since I got them. Noise cancelling is awesome. I use them with my Apple TV while he’s sleeping and I can’t hear his snoring! He uses them when he is doing yard work to help against the noise of the lawn mower and weed eater. We love them!! Great price for a top of the line quality!!,5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"This is my first ever amazon return. I usually trust ""Amazon's choice"" products, but this on was sadly a dud. The music quality is okay, not terrible, but the noise cancellation feature is pretty much non existent. When you put on the headphones, you'll notice an immediate reduction in noise with them off (they are bulky and act as earmuffs). But when you turn on the noise cancellation, the noise gets worse, not better- a squealing ringing starts and you'll feel pressure on your ears. It was painful for me, definitely not functional and not useable for what the headset was purchased for. In short, if you're looking for noise cancellation headphones, don't purchase these. If you're looking for a reasonably priced set of okay headphones, this may be what you're looking for.",1,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
I use this every day in my basement woodworking shop.  I have a TV that I listen to while I work.  It protects my hearing from the power tools and then I enjoy them as I rest in my in shop lounge chair for the evening.

"I am really enjoying these headphones. I mostly use them to listen to teleconference phone calls, so not sure of the music quality, but these are really nice for the phone calls. The sound quality is good for what I am using them for and they are very comfortable (I have worn them many times for at least 2 hours) and were very easy to learn how to use. They are well built and pretty. I really like them.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
I got these a couple weeks ago. I read reviews on these stating they were great. The sound is crisp however the volume isn't loud at all. The noise cancelation I could tell no difference. I tried with several devices connected to it. I would say these are ok. But honestly I thought the skullcandy Hesh 3 were a much better bang for your buck.Customer service is pretty decent with Cowin though,3,1,2019-4-12,1,1,0
"Decent music quality but lshoddy design. The right cup of mine seem to be loose and moves and makes noise when I walk. Also there's a slight buzzing noise every every other time I turn them on that's in the background the whole time they're on. Wasn't expecting a miracle for $60 and the actual audio quality is pretty good but the little bugs really ruin the experience. Maybe I just got a defective way or maybe they're all like this. Not sure, be prepared.",2,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
When I first ordered these headphones they were defective. It would work then  just shutdown then in a few minutes later they would work again and it kept on doing it. So I contacted the seller and they resolved my issue. They sent me a new pair and it works perfectly. When I go on my riding lawnmower it pretty much cancels out the noise and I can  listen to my music. The sound is great but the base is ok. All in all this is a great product and the seller will resolve any issues that you might have.,5,1,2017-7-26,1,0,0
"These headphones are not the same as the more expensive Bose headphones, but for the price they hold up to the competition.  Based on how well these have sounded over the first few uses, there is no reason to spend four times as much on Bose headphones, unless you are a crazy audiophile.  Not a huge fan of the look of them, but I'm 42 years old and don't really need to worry how ""cool"" I look.  They get the job done at a great price.  I would definitely recommend.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

"I wanted some noise cancelling headphones for my flight overseas and these for the bill! The were very affordable and did a good job suppressing the drone of the planes engines.

"I love these things! I am normally very particular about my headphones, and am normally disappointed with anything that costs less than an arm and a leg. I saw these on sale at approx. $70 (normal price was listed as $100), and decided that I would give them a shot in order to experiment with Active Noise Cancelling.The best way to experience these headphones is while listening to something while Noise Cancelling is turned on. if you only have Noise Canceling on, several outside noises can still be noticed even if they are much quieter. If you are only listening to something, it feels as if you are missing certain levels of your audio. With the both of them together, you get the true experience these headphones offer- a vibrant and diverse audio range that effectively shuts out most outside noise.",5,1,2017-10-24,1,0,0
"Headphones must have battery charge to even use, even with AUX cord. Doesn't help that the whole thing looks like a discount cheap Fry's headphone, with the metal wannabe looking plastic.

I took a chance with a no-name brand, and I am immediately looking to return it within 10 hours of getting it, with over half of that waiting for it to charge.However, I will give this to it. It has a good base kick, and the sound is pretty nice. However, it is still not worth the hassle of both the ugliness and inconvenience.",2,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0

"I am very pleased. I am no audiophile, but the sound seems excellent to me with plenty of base. There are many excellent offerings in this price range, but the deciding factor was the removable and replaceable lithium ion battery. No one mentions if their product has such a feature. I only learned of it through a video someone posted. Despite being heavier, they are quite comfortable to wear for hours at a time and hey are well-built. I even wore them in drizzle rain with no issues. I have never had active noise cancelling headphones, so I didn't know what to expect. It cuts SOME of the external noise out, but at the expense of shifting the audio to having less bass. I have read the same of competitors' offerings in this price range. They seem to last forever on a charge. A definite recommend!",5,1,2018-1-28,1,0,0
"They sound good, if ""noise cancelling"" is on. Otherwise it's super muddy like you're listening out of a seashell. Battery wise I am not impressed. I don't get 30 hours, maybe 10.

The top button is previous/volume down, and the bottom is next/volume up, that just seems odd.",3,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

These are very good headphones. I use them for mowing the grass. My on complaint is they don’t have enough force to seal as needed to omit the noise. If I push them in with my hands the really make a difference but can’t do that and drive the tractor. I have not given much thought to how to get them to seal better. I’ll put on my thinking hat and try to come up with a solution. Oh maybe wearing a tight hat will get me there,3,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
I like the product and the price point. I've had these headphones since April 2019 and they seem to be defective now in January 2020. They like to randomly die or just become unresponsive even after a full charge. I'll try to reconnect the bluetooth when this happens and they connect but I cannot get sound. The headphones always show a full charge on the phone display but somehow manage to randomly die. They were great at first but a few months of use and they are not very good anymore. Pretty dissatisfied.,2,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
"Very happy with these for the price. I can only compare them too a $300+ set of Bose headphones I had borrowed. Those were virtually noise cancelling, these are noise reducing.

"I bought these on Prime Day July 11th 2017. I was skeptical about how good they could sound for $70.

As I am writing this review, I have them on for the first time linked to my Ipod, the sound quality, clarity, bass, mid range and treble are absolutely unbelievable. I have been shopping for months for a pair of high quality, full functioning bluetooth active noise canceling headphones that I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for. I have a pair of high quality studio headphones that are wired which I did pay an arm and a leg for and these compare equally in sound quality. I can't comment on their durability because I obviously haven't had them long enough, but they appear to be built to last.

I am able to walk away from my computer and still hear music playing through the headphones, even when i move upstairs two levels in my house. Listening to music is great with these headphones, the sound is crystal clear. The noise cancellation feature allows me to listen to the music when there are other noises in the room. When i play games with these headphones i enjoy listening to the deep bass of explosions.All in all i'd recommend these headphones, there is also a VIP bonus if you register your purchase with the manufacture. They will extend your warranty when you signup on their website.",5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
I use these headphones for TV watching so I don’t disturb my sleeping wife. The sound quality is great. I had an intermittent problem with the first pair I received and called customer service. First of all there was no long wait time. A live person answered the call and after speaking with her and describing the intermittent problem she had a new set of headphones sent right out. Awesome customer service. Every company should follow their example for customer service. The replacement headphones work perfectly with no problems.

"I bought these headphones as an alternative to super expensive other brand name wireless noise cancelling headphones, and so far I'm really pleased I did. They look shiny and feel comfortable. In terms of specs and noise cancelling performance they probably don't stand up to Bose but for the price difference, I don't mind that. I needed headphones that were wireless, comfortable, and blocked out noise from around me, and these do exactly that. The battery has a good lifetime, as I use this on average 5 hours a week and probably only have to charge for a couple hours every other week or so.

I mean, yeah, I appreciate a good bargain as much as the next guy, but if I had know I’d be able to use them for less than a year, I would definitely have opted to spend a bit more.

These headphones are great so far. I use them most of the time and the battery lasts long. They are really comfy as well. They don't squeeze my head or fall off easily. They are great and the sound sounds so clear and amazing. The bass as well. I even noticed there were more instruments or different sounds I haven't heard before in the songs I like. These headphones are way better than any other headphone I used previously. It's a pretty good deal if I say so. I am a bit broke so headphones such as beats or any other popular or better brand is out of my reach but these are perfect. They fit my budget.,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
Used the headphones for daily commuting on the subway. The noise cancelling feature is a joke. The sound quality is also a joke. Only benefit was the bluetooth technology - which would periodically disconnect from my phone mid song. Save your $ and buy another product.

I bought this headphone because my earbuds were starting to hurt the more I used them.  I used these on my last flight and they performed great.  Watching Netflix on my phone there was no delay in the audio and I could hear very well without having to turn the volume up to max.  I did notice with the noise cancellation turned on the audio did dip some but it did cancel out the vibrations and background noise of the aircraft so it worked as it should.  I thought the sound was better with the NC turned off.  So I'm happy with the performance of this product and it fits my needs.,4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0

Switching to my old Aukey earbuds/mic fixes the issue so I know it has to be my headset. Another weird thing to note is that these will not work at all if you don't have a charge.

I didn't know my neighbor had been shot until the police came to my door.  Would recommend to anyone. Excellent deal for the price.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"I got one liked it so well I got another for my wife, not long after that mine turned to junk. when i went to insert cord to charge them the charging port inside them brook away and fell inside. My wife are still working not sure how long that will last, she has only used them about 5 times since she has had them.",1,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"The few times i wore these headphones, there was quite a lag, difficulty syncing to my mac laptop and finally broke. I thought something that was highly rated would have lasted a while. Unfortunately, these headphones (used maybe 10 times, not even roughly handled) broke before a year was up. See picture.",1,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
Cannot be used in an Open Office. These leak sound at a very low volume level with ANC enabled. I guess they are what they call open-back which isn't mentioned at all in the description. I primarily got these for a noisy open office and wore them less than an hour. I could hear my own keyboard as well as a colleague who is 4ft away crack his fingers. I've been using the Sony MDRZX110NC Noise Cancelling Headphones and they have been okay not the best noise cancelling but I can blast the music a bit to help with these that is a no go. If your volume was 0-100 and you put it on 12 EVERYONE can hear you. I would not recommend these for any kind of office if disrupting your neighbors with music would be a problem.,2,1,2017-8-8,1,3,0
These headphones deliver what they said they will do.  I am happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone looking for quality headphones that work like they are supposed to.  I have no complaints.,5,1,2018-11-25,1,1,0
"For the price, these are a pretty good buy. If you want great sound then go out and spend several hundred dollars. These are well built, sound pretty darn good and as rating the whole package, I'd have to say that I recommend them, for what that's worth. Try them, they're priced right and if you don't like them you can always send them back.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"I bought these for my boyfriend to use as his old work headphones were going out. He loves them, he said that the sound quality is comparable to Beats. The noise cancelling isn't too great but it works, he also said that there's a bit of a learning curve after getting used to his old headphones.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"For the price the headphones are acceptable. They fit well over my ears and are comfortable for long time intervals. The sound quality is pretty OK, and I'm told that the mic quality is downright terrible. However, the noise cancellation functions very well to cancel out the low frequency drones and hums that annoy me.Overall, the quality of the build chassis is high, comfort is high, but it falls behind in the quality of sound and microphone.",4,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
"This SHOULD be a 4/5 star review; HOWEVER, after less than 6 months, the articulation broke on the left ear piece, rendering them unable to sit right in my ear. It wasn't even a ""user error""- it just literally fell apart when I picked them up to put them on at my desk at work.*UPDATED 1/10/2019* Company contacted me and apologized for the broken headphones. These are sold under warranty and replaced headphone were express shipped to my house. If you have problems within 18 months, don't be afraid to contact their warranty line- they were very receptive and very polite!",4,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"I wanted a decent set that I can wear around while walking the dog, mowing the lawn or just chillin'.  So far, they sound great, and feel comfortable.  My ears get a little sweaty in them, but I think that is to be expected.  Overall, the comfort level is good, the sound is good and the bass is good.It's been about a month and just wanted to say that I am pretty happy with these.  Sound quality is good, noise cancelling is good.  Not too heavy.  Goes quite a while on a single charge.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. I don't normally like headphones that rest on top of my head, as they make my head hurt over a period of time. These have a substantial foam cushion on the part that rests on top of the head. The size adjustment is also great. It does not just slide down. It actually has increments that it moves so that once you adjust it, it stays in place.  The ear comfort is phenomenal. I wore them most of the day yesterday and didn't have to ""break my ears in"" at all. There was zero discomfort. These headphones are super sharp looking and sound very good. They also have noise reduction, which works pretty well.",5,1,2017-5-23,1,0,0
I am still learning on these Cowin E7 ANC headphones. They perform as good as $200+ units I have purchased. I would recommend the E7 ANC all day long. In color red they striking.

"I really enjoy these.  They have a great sound and were very easy to pair.  I use them almost every day.  The only 2 things I wish they had were 1. the ability to pair to multiple devices and 2. auto-shutoff ( I am super guilty of accidentally leaving them on).  Overall, I would buy these again.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
My first experience with active noise cancelling headphones... Bought them to use a work - to participate in online meetings and to block out distractions.  Didn't realize the 'white noise' they play in the building until I turned these on!  Sounds quality is great in meetings and listening to music.  Comfortable fit with a quality feel.  Couldn't be happier!,5,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0
"Updated review: I was contacted recently from customer service at Cowin by their representative, Lexi, reaching out to provide a resolution to my issue below, either in the form of a replacement, resolution for the existing device, or an upgraded version at no additional charge!  After corresponding with a few emails, we resolved the issue and these work great now with my iPad!  Superior customer service experience.  Thank you.Does not connect to an iPad, which is why I purchased this.  I don’t recall reading that in the description.  Will connect to an iPhone, but I needed it to watch movies, etc on an iPad. Useless to me...",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"They work and that's their only positive. Battery life is great and sound quality is alright. However sometimes I have problems turning it on as it seems to take a while for it to ""boot up."" Also whenever they're low on battery a robot lady's voice takes over and constantly repeats ""Please Charging"" over and over again and it's extremely frustrating; I'd rather they just turn off.",3,1,2020-9-21,1,1,0
"I have been using a pair of Sony's for about a year, and they worked well, but my ears didn't know what they were missing.  I'm not even talking about the great quality sound, which is great btw, but I feel like I have a pillow wrapped around my head. They are a little bit heavy, but I wouldn't want it any other way. These are the awesome pillow top of an already great mattress.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"While the product has great sound quality it is not made to be worn by an active teenager, who I purchased them for. I should have done more research before buying these noise cancelling headphones. The plastic brittle parts which snapped make the product useless. Which is why i give four stars. I am now searching for a product that will last. Good quality product for someone who just sits.",4,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"So far, so good. I have no complaints. Listening to some jazz as I type this review. I got my headphones right before my flight out to Boston. I've owned a mix of over the ear to earbuds but prefer the former from brands like Shure, Beats, and Bose, just to name a few. I didn't want to pay a lot and decided to take a chance on these, and I have no regrets. You have the option to connect an Audio Auxiliary Stereo Audio Cable 3.5mm Stereo Jack Male to Male (not included), especially when you are flying Delta (onboard entertainment). Included is a beautiful leather or vinyl bag to hold your headphones, but I bought a hard travel case to protect it.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,1
I love these headphones. We got our son Beats Studio 3 headphones for Christmas and I fell in love with them while we were on a post holiday road trip. I decided I would try the Cowen E7 headphones for myself cause I couldn’t stomach putting out another chunk of change for my own Beats. I’m glad I didn’t cause the Cowen’s are great...my daughter likes them more than the Beats and I do too...and the Beats are great. I would by another pair of Cowen E7 tomorrow if I needed them,5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I absolutely love these headphones. I have agoraphobia and sound sensitivity issues (sounds like people talking or shouting). I bought these headphones because I went to a convention and I wanted noise canceling headphones as a way to deal with my panic attacks (before they get to that point). Using these headphones and a safety plan, I was able to enjoy the con for the most part. I always use these when I go out. Even without music, the noise canceling helps to keep me calm.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"Good set of bluetooth enabled noise-cancelling headphones.  I bought primarily to where during air travel and they are quite good at limiting the engine noise coming through.  Sound quality on these is solid, but not excellent. I have tinnitus, and can't discern the differences between top-notch and almost top-notch anyway (particularly aboard an airplane), so these are more than sufficient for me...at a price-point a fraction of a Beats or Bose unit.",4,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
These have excellent sound quality and are very easy to use. One time bluetooth connect and you're good to go. I can't see how you could find anything better in this price range. I've watched 5 movies and the battery is still at 90%. Battery level is displayed when you turn on bluetooth so you know where you are on usage.,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"The swivel pin on one ear broke after 1 year, leaving the ear pad hanging off.. The company website doesn't work, the phone number doesn't work and the e-mail doesn't work.This was my original review. since then, I have been contacted by Cowin and they sent me new headphones and worked with me to ensure my concerns were addressed.",3,1,2019-3-31,1,1,0
"These are so wonderful, I bought another set for my office after one day of trying these.  I have to wear headphones for video conferencing and usually find that they start to hurt my ears after less than an hour or that they just feel heavy and awkward.  These are perfectly comfortable, the sound quality is great.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"The headphones are well constructed wireless or wired operationally.  The fit is comfortable.  The sound filter muffs do a good job of eliminating outside noise, sounds.  The sound is crisp and clean.  The best pair of headphones I have owned to date.  Moderately priced for the quality of the unit.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
I use them every day.  The price is reasonable and they minimize noise and let you take personal calls or listen to music.  I have mine setup with my computer and listen to music or YouTube at work while I'm working rather than listen to all the chatter around me.  I couldn't work without them now.,5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
I ordered this product based on the comparison to the bose noise canceling headphones. While they are far less expensive they pale and comparison to most of the noise canceling headphones. I have some Samsung over-the-ear headphones that I bought for traveling for around the same price that produce far better sound. These headphones are very clunky and sound at Max volume is still hard to hear while mowing the grass. I will be returning these headphones because in my opinion they're not even close in quality to the competition.UPDATE:,4,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
"While these headphones are okay, they sit right on the outer edge of my ear, which gets sore after wearing them with earrings (I have three lobe holes and cartilage pierced) for hours.  Customer service was so helpful and quick in helping me upgrade to the SE7, which have a taller ear cup and do fit around the ear.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
I purchased these for my wife as a gift as we like to use them when traveling. These won't eliminate all outside noise but they are good for watching movies or listening to music without being distracted by other noises on an airplane. They are comfortable as she wore them for a 3 hour flight without any discomfort that she had previously from earbuds.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"For the money, this is the best set of headphones I’ve ever bought. Sound quality is great and they are durable. Their rotating design keeps them from snapping  in half when removing from the head. Just need to change the low battery message from “Please be charging”. What kind of message is “please be charging”? Lol",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
Very comfortable on the head/ears. Sound quality is great. I fly frequently and these are the only reason I can sleep. Flight attendants have to shake me because I cant's hear them.

"The sound is good, the noise cancellation is good and they're comfortable. If you're a music/sound snob you won't like them but for a $50 pair of headphones they're fine.

"These headphones exceeded my expectations. They are comfortable, sound great and easy to operate. They are also easy to link up with various devices. I turned around and ordered the hard case for them and felt it was well worth it. The case is lightweight but strong. I really am impressed with these headphones. You can't beat the quality for the money. If you are on the fence all I can say is try them!",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
I love these headphones.

"I really liked these headphones until I'd worn them for a couple of hours, then my ears started to hurt because of the pressure they exerted.  This was surprising because the description emphasized comfort.  They are not comfortable for more than an hour or so.  I had to return them.",2,1,2019-6-17,1,1,0
"These aren't cutting edge or top of the line. What they are is a reliable and high quality set of headphones that don't have any major issues. Great for PC gaming, music on the go or just immersion. The noise cancelling isn't great but it does make a little bit of a difference. It's basically just white noise. Aside from that the sound quality is pretty good, the bass is nice, and the construction seems sturdy.",4,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
"I was more than pleasantly  surprised  by the quality  and ease of use of these Cowin  earphones.Pairing  with tv, I-pad, smartphone each a  snap.  Sound quality superb, not perhaps for  audiophiles,  but bass, treble,  voice and music remarkable, especially given their modest price.The  earphones are soft and comfortable; may need to come off every  couple hours for some cool air since they are fitted and do get warm.",5,1,2018-2-23,1,0,0
"As others have pointed out in previous reviews, the active noise cancelling (ANC) causes the sound to cut in and out whenever there is the slightest movement of the headphones. So, as long as you sit perfectly still the noise cancelling works. For example, while running on a treadmill don't even bother using the ANC option and just go with the non-ANC setting (""BT"" selection on the headphones). Overall, nothing too great about these headphones. The sound is generally good and you can't beat the price.",2,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0
"Let's face it, most of us above a certain age just can't hear like we used to so all the BS about the sound quality of the high end headphones is irrelevant for us.

ABSOLUTELY THE WORST.  I purchased for my kids virtual learning. Set up Bluetooth and assumed all was good - joke was on me.

"These Cowin headphones are very comfortable, and very easy to pair with your Bluetooth device. I had previously posted that I had an issue with the first pair and after refunding my money, Cowin asked if I would try another pair so I agreed. The new ones work exactly as I'd hoped. The sound is crisp and clear, and they are easy to use! I am so glad they reached out to me and offered the opportunity to try another set without charging me for them. I will be recommending these headphones to colleagues since they are a great product with a great company that stands behind them. I work with Online Communications for another company and have high standards for customer service. Cowin has an A+ in my book!",5,1,2016-10-10,1,0,0

"UPDATE: There are two positions for the Bluetooth:regular and noise cancelling. So yeah the noise cancelling works. Disregard my comment on how it doesn't.I can't give these 5 stars for the price. Occasional stuttering in Bluetooth mode, low frequencies have issues if they're loud enough, and I can't really get the feeling of noise canceling. Noise isolating, totally. Not canceling though. But they are adjustable, comfortable, and don't sound awful. Great for the gym.",4,1,2018-3-5,1,0,0
"I travel on planes every month and I wanted noise cancelling, bluetooth and comfort & this pair of headphone delivers. The controls (go on the right ear) are easy to navigate and simple. The noise cancelling is very good! I was impressed with the light weight and comfort. I have a smaller head and ears, and they fit nicely. I like that they do not require batteries and can be plugged directly in to a phone or computer as well. I have had various headphones (in ear, over ear, on ear, Bose, Sony, etc.) and these are by far my favorite when it comes to comfort, sound, ease of connectivity, wireless, & noise cancelling all in one.Con: They are bulky to carry around as they do not fold up that small, but for the price and quality it was worth it. I made sure to purchase the COIN Carrying Case as well so they are safe when not in use.",5,1,2017-7-9,1,0,0
"I have just started using these headphones in the last few days.  So far, so good.  Although it came out of the box with some charge, I found I could only pair with my tablet after a full charge.

I will update this rating if appropriate.",4,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0

I use the Cowin E7 headphones when I take flights and at home listening to music.  They are so comfortable for long flights and blocking out so much of the noise on the flight makes the flight so much better.  They have great sound quality and bass response as well.

When I go for a walk, the cord gets tangled in my dog's leash and my regular headphones were often falling out.

"If only they sounded as good as they look! When you see the packaging, you’d think these are high-end headphones. They’re attractive and comfortable. But then you connect your music. Oh my! It was as if I traveled back to the 70s and was listening to music through my $15 Radio Shack headphones! Overpowering low frequencies that were muddy. No high-end frequencies whatsoever. The earbuds that came with my first iPhone ten years ago sound better than these! I tried a different song, but no better. Then I tested the phone call feature. My wife said she heard a clicking noise the whole time we were talking. She also said I sounded muddy and unclear. I connected my Motorola wireless earbuds and the difference was night & day. I had high hopes for these, based on the reviews. I had even consulted an independent review where they were rated the second best wireless noise canceling headphones. I’m not sure who these people are that think these sound good, but they’re obviously not people with an ear for balanced audio. I sent them back immediately!",2,1,2017-12-28,1,1,0

I usually just take them off and get on with other things only to come back and find them completely out of charge. What's worse is that they need a little bit of charge time before you can use them if the battery is flat, even with the charge cable in. Also when the usb cable is plugged in it's very noisy. I thought cordless would be more convenient but turns out to be more of a hassle... I'll prob never buy cordless headphones again, better one cord than two. If you have the cordless headphone routine down though, this is probably fine.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"These headphones are hands down the best headphones! They have helped tremendously with virtual learning. My kids share a learning space and they both have a pair of these and they don’t even hear each other! If you are on the fence about these, go for it! They are 100% worth every penny!",5,1,2020-9-22,1,1,0
"This Bluetooth headphone is so awesome, the bass is excellent, the noise cancelling function works very well. Also when the device fully charged you can use it for about 30 hours. The ear padding feels very comfortable. To be honest with you, this headphone quality can compare to those cost 3 times more of the same products. If you are looking for a high quality and not too expensive Bluetooth headphone, this is the one. Highly recommend.",5,1,2018-2-3,1,0,0
"These headphones have always been comfy in the right way for me. I even reordered an identical pair after misplacing one!The newest pair was consistently comfy, and I would order another pair had they lasted longer. The durability of the headphones proved less consistent with the second purchase, but overall I was still very happy with their performance.",4,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"when I first got these, the sound was very jumbled and made everything sound far away, it was bizarre, but then they started working better, idk if the Bluetooth connection improved or what. The sound quality was pretty good then except it would just cut out for about a second every few seconds so it was hard to listen to things. They reached out and are sending me a new pair so I’ll update my review when I get the new one and put a better rating if the new one is better. It did take a while for them to reach out, but they did offer me either a new pair or a refund so customer service isn’t terrible.",4,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"These work great.  Great sound.  Didn’t realize what I was missing using cheaper headphones and earbuds.  What a world of difference!  Great fit and so far, seems to have long battery life on a charge.  Really pleased with that!  Also really comfortable to where.  Can’t say enough about them.  A great set of headphones!",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"I bought this product for travel only.  The headphones were certainly cheap enough, have bluetooth connectivity, and are rugged enough for backpack time.  I was surprised at how easy the setup was and how quickly I was using the headphones.  Although I have not tested the noise cancellation feature in actual flight yet, flipping the switch instantly reduces background noise around the house.  Music and voice sounds are clear.  The headphones fit comfortably over eyeglasses and completely cover my ears.  I have two problems with these headphones, but am not sure I should expect a change at this price.  There is no way to know how much charge is left in the battery, and sound quality needs an equalizer to get right (for me), but neither takes much away from a pretty good product.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.",4,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0
"So far, pretty good. Definitely a different sound with ANC on - as expected. Very comfortable cup cushions. To me, the volume controls are counter-intuitive - volume down is on top and volume up is on bottom ??  For the cost of these, they are a nice set of headphones.ANC - effective at lower frequencies. Cuts both the commercial mower I tested it near and a really loud homeowner version by at least 50%, possibly more - based on my ears, not an instrumented test",4,1,2016-6-29,1,3,0
"These headphones were a gift for my daughter who is a work-from-home transcriptionist.  The product arrived sooner than expected which was great for her. Needless to say, she loves this pair of headphones.  The built-in active noise cancellation is perfect for her work because she needs to focus on the speakers.  Ran a headphone test and these headphones surpassed our expectations. This is an excellent pair of headphones at a great price!",5,1,2019-11-19,1,1,0
"I was skeptical at first because I was not sure if it was going to do just as the product description says, but now, I have no worries. When they say noise canceling, they mean it. The headphones are soft on the skin, and the noise canceling is great to the point where people have to yell really loud for me to even sort of hear them. I was on a 6 hour and a half plane ride with it, and I was sitting by the window, but the moment I put those headphones on and put on the music, the loud noise was drowned by my music. The sound quality is great. It almost surrounds you. Also (very important) the battery does last long. I forgot when was the last time I charged it. My other headphones never lasted this long. It is worth the money!",5,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0

"I ordered the E7 headphones back March 2019. The sound quality was excellent! I only used them 1 time until a week ago. May25th. I turned them on to use while mowing the lawn. The sound only came out one side. I called Amazon and was referred to manufacturer for warranty. I was totally surprised at them immediately sending a replacement set! They were FANTASTIC and I highly recommend the Cowin E7 headphones not only for the quality, but for their customer service!!",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"The headphones looked good and worked well (pretty good noise cancellation, sound quality, etc.) but the left side broke (at the swivel part) less than 6 months after I purchased it from normal everyday use. I immediately purchased another (refurbished) one but that one broke in the same spot too. I was happy with the headphones, I just wished they were sturdier and better designed.",2,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0
Bose is obviously better! But for the price these are damn good! The overall sound quality is excellent while the base and noise cancellation are both great! The battery life seems decent but I have not put it through strict testing. I would give it a 4 out of five simply because I have experienced better. That being said I would still use this as my daily driver so to speak.,4,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0

"I loved these headphones so much that after my first purchase, I got another for my wife. Long story short, they worked perfectly as others have attested to.Two nights ago they broke at the swivel as I was rolling over. I wrote to the customer service and expected the long drawn out ""send then here... pay this fee... get his piece... do this repair..."" etc. What I got instead was an immediate replacement. Obviously this is exceptional customer service. I am greatly appreciative of this approach and will not only be buying more of these for my children, but I'll be telling others as well!

"For the price, these headphones are great! I don't worry about traveling with them, because if I end up losing them on a trip, I won't be totally bummed because of the price-point. That being said, the sound quality is excellent, however noise cancellation is not so good if you're on a crowded airplane. If you have a smaller head, the band can get a little uncomfortable; I found myself repositioning it a lot.",4,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0

Overall, am satisfied with the headphones, sound quality is very good, bass is adequate, but not quite as good as I prefer, the noise cancellation feature works well, but does bring down the sound quality when used.

Is there a message in that?UPDATE: Now that I've had this product for approximately two years I am pleased to report that I am very happy with the audio functions, but do have an issue with the products padded sections. Specifically, the padding around the ear muffs and the crossover band is disintegrating and flaking off-- leaving blacks flecks throughout my very graying hair. Would have appreciated the product more if the padding material was of better quality. As a result, I am lowering the rating to four (4) stars.",4,1,2017-7-20,1,0,0
So far they are ok. Not wowed but have only used a handful of times. They cancel 65% of noise. They quality of volume is not as expected but maybe I am missing a control to turn up volume. They are pretty comfy and I like how you can control how they fit on head. I will update review once more use is had.,4,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"Although their sound quality is not excellent, they still sound pretty darn good ... when Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) is turned Off. Unfortunately, when ANC is turned On, the sound gains what I can only describe as a ""hollow"" quality. For me, the quality degrades too much to use ANC while listening to music. Now, when the headphones are used for the ANC just to drown out noise, they also work pretty well.I have not tested the ANC capability when the headphones are wired to the music/audio source.",4,1,2017-7-19,1,0,0

No matter how many times I reconnect the headphones from the Bluetooth to the Noice Cancellation they freeze and I hear a buzzing noise for a while and they disconnect. I will not be away from the Bluetooth and it will do it all the time. I got them a week ago the purple ones. I am very disappointed. I got my bf the Black headphones he has had no problem.

"Great headphones for the price. I was a little skeptical due to the lower price (compared to Bose), but they are amazing.Connect quickly to Bluetooth, and you can hear the noise cancelling when you aren’t playing anything. It sounds like a low volume white noise machine. My only issue is that the volume buttons seem to be flipped (turn down is on the top and turn up is on the bottom) and to turn the volume up, you have to long hold; a short press changes the song. It’s pretty much the opposite of the apple earbuds I’m used to. However, I’m sure I’ll adapt.",5,1,2018-2-2,1,0,0

I've tried Bose noise-canceling headphones and several non-name brands as well. Most didn't fit right and the Bose cost so much I was worried I might have to sell a child.

I love these headphones. The noise canceling on them is great when audio is playing but with audio off you can still hear but you only hear muffled sound. I use these everyday for my firestick and for on the go.

I usually don’t write reviews but I just had a very long flight and it cancelled out a lot of the jet noise and I was able to hear so much more of the movies and the music I was listening to on the plane.

I could turn on the noise cancelling feature and hear my music with great quality. I also have used them for video meetings on Zoom and voice quality is good as well.The headphones stopped playing sound 2.5 months after purchase. I sent customer service an email. Received a response within hours. In the same day Cowin honored the warranty and I had a replacement delivered to my door 2 days from the time I initially emailed them about the issue.

What's not to like? These headphones look like they should cost three times their price. The earpads are soft and very comfortable for extended wear. Sound quality is very good. I bought the Cowin E7 headphones to use outside while doing yard work. My other headphones are Sony WH1000XM3 and I didn't want to risk damaging them.

"This is my first set of decent over-ear headphones. I have owned several Bluetooth in-ear sets, primarily for working out, and I still have a pair of those that I use mostly for that purpose. However, for sitting at my desk or in my house, these are outstanding. The sound quality is the best that I have experienced (though that is to be expected since they are the most expensive set I have owned), the Bluetooth works exactly how it is supposed to. I haven't really explored the NFC to see how it works. The active noise cancelling is great, better than I expected. My criteria when searching for my next purchase included over-ear, Bluetooth, and ANC. These were the best quality I could find anywhere in my price range, and I am very pleased with the value. No issues have arisen, and they seem well built. So for now this product meets and exceeds my lofty expectations and earns its 5 star rating.",5,1,2016-12-29,1,0,0

The quality of sound doesn't drop even when at full volume. Also the battery life is amazing. I charged it for maybe an hour and it lasts days on end. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because even when I'm within maybe 3 feet of my phone the headphones have trouble connecting to it and staying connected. It's not my phone since it only happens with the headphones. But other wise these are great. My family noticed how much I liked them and bought similar. Even my grandpa has a pair. These are great and definitely worth the buy.",4,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
These are ok Bluetooth headphones. Either the noise cancelling does not work on these or it’s just that poor. Just took them on the plane for the first time and they were awe full at noise cancelling. Sound was average and bass was of average quality.

I would highly recommend these. You can use them 2 different ways. They're comfortable and one charge last awhile.,5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,1
"These are great headphones overall. Amazing battery time and sound quality, and they just look as good as you can get.The problem is that it is advertised as noise-canceling and as having a built-in microphone for hands-free calling. The noise-canceling sucks unless all you need to cancel is the white noise you get when you put the headphones on (a similar effect to putting a conch shell up to your ear). The mic doesn't really pick up sound very well. It works, but you have to make sure to talk VERY clearly and pretty loud for it to pick up your voice at a reasonable volume.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"The sound quality of these headphones are very nice! The noise cancellation is also very good, it effectively muffles the sound around me, although, as an artist I don’t typically experience a very loud atmosphere. These headphones are comfortable for long wear and do not die during long listening sessions either! Overall, I highly recommend these headphones!",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
I have owned 5 pair of OE bluetooth headphones.  I found these on a sale and they were worth the $40.  Full price may be a little much.  The noise canceling works well and the sound is decent enough.  But for slightly more  VMODA makes a much better product that is much more durable.  The battery life is as stated and it is the best of any in its class that I have owned.  Definately better than any Beats product I have used that is under $150.  VMODA Crossfade can be found for around $100 if you watch closely.  They might be a better bet if you are paying full price for the Corwins.,4,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0
"These headphones have allowed me to watch tv again without the volume being turned up to 90 or above.  I had a tumor removed from my brain stem six years ago which left me deaf in one ear and with limited hearing in the other due to nerve damage.  For me to watch tv, I had to have the volume up so high it bothered anyone else in the house.  These headphones changed that.  I can now enjoy my favorite shows with the volume on the tv completely muted.  My hearing damage is tone related, not amplification.  I can’t say enough good about these.  The cost was definitely worth it for me.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
These headsets are very lacking when you are over 5 feet from you Wi-Fi Bluetooth device. On charging after the first use I received about 3 days  and 5-6 hours of use before they were dead again. NOT Happy At All,2,1,2019-12-26,1,1,0
Great product!  I strongly dislike other products that require holding a button for 5 sec to turn on/off and do other things.  I have been looking for a physical power switch for a long time.  Just flip the switch - on.  Or flip the switch to noise cancelling.  No guessing/messing around.,5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"In my 65 years I have had many headphones some good and others not to be talked about. However, this past 48 hours has been the best I have ever had. These headphones are professional, heavy built and in just two words ""Absolutely Fantastic"". I am glad I purchased these. I always pick three items, study the reviews and with the highest stars and then I make my final choice. I can not imagine another set with this quality and price.",5,1,2019-5-24,1,0,0
"These headphones sound very good and for me well. I have a pretty thick head so I was worked that they would be too tight, but they actual fit my head great! They are stylish and have good sounds. I will definitely be buying my cousin a set as a birthday gift.  5/5, I would buy again.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"Overall these are great headphones; the bluetooth connects reliably, the fit is really nice, and the price is great. The only downside is that the sounds is just a bit flat. There's a muffled feeling, I'm not sure if this is a product of the noise canceling, but overall they're very worth it for the price.",4,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"While I like these headphones, and I really do, I am disappointed that not even a year later the left ear cup pivot point has snapped meaning the only thing holding the left cup on is the wires. I also take pretty good care of these. I have a hard case for them and leave them in there when they are not in use.My main wish is honestly just that the interior piece that is the pivot point for the cup was metal or at least stronger. I can see the plastic where it snapped and just wish it would have been a little sturdier.",2,1,2019-3-12,1,1,1
I work in a factory with semi-loud machinery and these cancel the noise quite well.They take about 3 hours to change. I get roughly 40 hours of use with a Bluetooth connection at medium volume.,4,1,2018-10-16,1,0,0
"I received a pair of the E7s for Father's Day and took them overseas.  They worked great on the airplane and were super comfortable.  Unfortunately, they got stolen in London.  When I returned home, I ordered another pair and still love them.  The noise cancellation sometimes cancels out too much of the music and I sometimes turn NC off.  Not a big deal.  I also use these headphones without music, just to limit the background noise and blanket me in silence.  If this pair gets stone, I will buy another pair of E7s!!",4,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"Comfortable headphones with decent sound.  Mine ""seem"" to be louder in the left ear than the right ear, but it may just be me.  It's negligible anyway.  Haven't burned through the 30-hr battery life yet, but I'm working on it, and will update this review if it isn't quite up to snuff.Recommended, leaning towards highly recommended, but only a year's worth of use will tell!",5,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"The noise cancellation is really only best for background noise, but besides that these headphones are really great if you want to ignore people! I lived with some pretty rowdy people when I bought these and they make it a lot easier to focus on my work. I only tried out the mic a couple times, but the person on the other side of those calls said it was a bit muffled.These headphones are also super cute and fit really well, and adjusting them was easy.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
I wanted some noise canceling for the gym and these worked for about 2 weeks before the band on the top started to get loose from placing them over my head day in and out it’s unfortunate because the sound quality is decent but the elasticity is made cheaply or maybe I got a defective pair.,3,1,2019-4-5,1,1,1
"I really liked the headphones. The sound is really good. For the price you are paying, you can't go wrong with this. The build material is also really good. It makes it look a little more expensive than its actual price. The earpads are really soft which means you can keep listening for hours without any pain. I honestly don't have any issues. Two things that I liked: Sound Quality and Build Quality. Maybe this is not important for everyone, but the packaging is also really well done with quality material, which is important to me, personally. Overall, really nice pair of headphones.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"These headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is very good. The ANC works well so far as I've tried them, but I haven't been on a flight yet to see how well the ANC works there. I expect they will work well on a flight given what I've tried so far. If they do not I will update my review. So far - 5 stars, especially considering the price.",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"I've used the bluetooth, noise cancelling bluetooth, audio in, and audio in/noise cancelling and all functions work well. I think the included audio cable has a short, but other than that I love these.I also got the hard case for them, which was a great purchase. They're best for plane rides in my opinion - noise cancellation is a miracle.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"There's only one small plastic part holding each heavy headphone into the frame and its meant to be flexible so they can swivel but this makes the product construction extremely flimsy. One of them cracked in half after only a week of use, I tried to glue it back together because $50 is expensive and didn't want to buy another one but the glue fix just broke now too. It sucks because I actually really like these in every other aspect. Save yourself the money and buy something else though.",1,1,2020-1-10,1,1,0
"Nice headphones. Bluetooth pairing was a breeze.Good audio quality but I do not know about the noise cancelling feature though. I am not a specialist but I tried on Boss and Sony noise cancelling headphones recently and there is quite a difference between them and the Cowin. Of course, the price is good but in my opinion they should advertise them as noise reduction headphones. Overall, I am pretty happy with and would recommend them.",4,1,2017-3-27,1,1,0
"These headphones are very good quality. I bought them for my work and I work in a machine manufacturing plant, so it’s very noisy. Once I have the headphones on, I cannot hear anything else, but my music or audiobook. Great buy and great price.P.S. my mother bought me “nose” headphones for Christmas and they are originally retailed at 100-200 dollars. The Cowin E7 headphones are much better.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Comfortable, well priced, great battery life, good sound quality. An excellent alternative to high priced noise-canceling headphones.Good headphones for the price range.

I purchased these a while back but just used them for the first time this past week. On a motor home trip I put them on to cancel out the noise while ridding in the back of the motor home. The right ear piece makes an annoying popping sound about every fifteen to thirty seconds. It is too distracting to use much.,1,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0

"Other than the earpiece swivels, I would rate this a 5.  The sound is great, pairing is easy, battery  life is incredible.  I have 3 pairs of these, the oldest I now use at the shooting range as ear protection.If a swivel does break, you can keep the usefulness by putting a self tapping screw of the appropriate size through the top part of the swivel and into the top of the swivel on the earpiece.  You have to have the extension all the way down to do this (see photo).  It doesn't swivel any longer but that hasn't bothered me at all - just a bit more space needed to store them in a backpack, etc.",4,1,2020-9-19,1,0,1
"Great headphones, great sound & very comfortable. I bought these for a long flight to watch a movie & listen to music. They did not cancel the plane noise very much, but I think for the price these are good quality headphones. I have to emphasize “comfort”, I do not like ear buds & very few headphones on my ears but I wore these for an entire movie with no discomfort.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
I bought these so I could switch between my phone (Bluetooth connection) and work computer (wired connection) without having to unpair/repair the Bluetooth or switch headsets throughout the day. Unfortunately the microphone doesn't work at all when plugged in with a cable and sounds absolutely terrible regardless.,1,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
From the first second I put them on I felt how comfortable they were.  Then I linked them to my laptop and Android phone.  The connections were quick and I was able to start using them for phone calls and listening to presentations and music.  I highly recommend them.,5,1,2020-6-7,1,1,0
I use this when I go to the pool so I can listen to my audiobooks from my iphone.  The pool is  a walking pool of 30 meters and I can listen to the book the entire length of the pool without any dropout. Battery life is good (I have never run out but I charge it every time I use it). Very comfortable on the head and ears.  My ears got hot with another set of headphones but that has not been a problem with this.  Price was also a very determining factor and I am happy there.,5,1,2017-12-28,1,0,0
"These head phones are just a little bigger than I would like, but they work well. Also they could be a little tighter to stay in place when I am working out.

Very good for the money. We bought two units of these for a long airplane trip overseas. These did the trick! I can't see spending 350 on Bose. Although these were not completely soundproof I did insert earplugs and then used these headphones. Even if you use the headphones without the noise cancelling feature they muffle noice.  I will be taking a unit with me to work as sometimes the chatter or outside noise is too much.The packaging resembled high end and there was a cute note thanking us for the purchase.  I received a follow up email as well from th company.,5,1,2017-9-18,1,0,0

"For all intents & purposes they are fine. I don’t like the fact that they stand straight up on the charger and therefore do not fit on the shelf that the prior ones did.

I’ve owned a number of high end headphones and none of them out perform these headphones.  I’ve paid 4 times as much for a high end brand that quit working so I picked up the E7 hoping they would meet my needs.

"This is a high quality set, especially for the $$.  Noise cancelling feature works very well, to my ears.  Though I am not an audiophile, sound quality is excellent, with plenty of bass.  I haven't really tested battery endurance, it has to be more than 10 hours.  Comfortable over ears, with good fit.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"These headphones are amazing! I absolutely love the bluetooth feature, I can never go back to having wired headphones again! Also the battery life is amazing! After shopping around on amazon, I noticed this one had the longest battery life and it hasn't disappointed me yet! So far I've used them for a 3-7 hours each day, and haven't needed to charge since a week ago! As for the noise-cancelling, I'm pretty satisfied with it. While it doesn't completely block out sounds, it's good enough to help you concentrate in noisy areas.Edit: After more than 1 year, one side of these headphones stopped working (was noticeably softer than the other side). I contacted Cowin support about the issue and they gladly helped to replace the headphones with new ones! The customer service excellent and they held true to their warranty policy. I was glad to get new ones because I really liked using these! Thank you, Cowin!",5,1,2017-2-12,1,0,0
"Sound quality is excellent. Noise cancelling works very well. Slightly heavy. Bluetooth range is short. I left my phone in home office, went to pantry to get something and the signal becomes intermittent at best. Maybe 50 ft across and all the doors are open. I bought the white color. Now I realized that it’s difficult to make white look elegant at this price range because it can’t be leather. I’m debating whether to replace with a black. Overall first impression is 4 + star.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"These were comfy and I did like the noise canceling but you can hear everything the user is listening to. I always hate sitting on an airplane and having to listen to their music leaking out of their headphones. Airplanes are loud and you can hear everything on these when someone was using them. If you are using these by yourself there is no issue. The fit was good and comfortable, bass and all ranges sounded great. I just cant be that inconsiderate to others around me.",2,1,2017-8-28,1,2,0
My headphones broke within exactly one month of having them. The piece that holds the actual headphone onto the headband part has snapped due to Cowin using cheap plastic for that part. I’ve tried to use glue and duct tape to hold the part back together but even that only lasts about one day. I want a refund☹️.,2,1,2019-8-18,1,1,1
"The only thing I don't like is that it didn't come with a dongle for pc. Other than that, this is a great product. Fairly strong, great sound quality, and is comfortable to wear. All in all I would recommend the product. Just remember, if you intend to use this make sure the device supports bluetooth (or you have a bluetooth dongle).",4,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0
"They were packed very nicely, I got the purple color ones and the color is so beautiful, i would wear them with any outfit.

They sound too bass heavy...not enough treble.  Hard to get used to.  Seems like Bass is boosted at the expense of all else.  Would be nice if they could put in some adjustment into them.  So if you love bass at the expense of clarity and crispness these would be perfect for you.,5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones for use while flying; to reduce the noise level on long flights.  I'll try them on a 7+ hour flight in a few weeks.  Meanwhile, I like to use them while relaxing in my favorite chair,  They are great for audiobooks and streaming music, without bothering others in the room.  I have fallen asleep while wearing them several times.  The combination of noise-cancelling and my favorite music is too much to resist.  I would recommend these to others.",5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"I've had these headphones for a few days now and I'm very much enjoying them. They're very comfortable and I'm able to wear them for long periods of time which is amazing as I do wear glasses so finding headphones that don't press my frames into my head is pretty difficult. They pair very easily and the sound quality is really nice. They're the biggest headphones I've gotten but they're not super large or very heavy IMO. My only complaint is that the audio cord that comes with them seems more or less pointless unless you want to use them with something that is not Bluetooth compatible. The headphones won't work with the cord if the headphones are switched off or out of battery and the cord is also fairly short. This isn't a dealbreaker for me but it is sorta frustrating since one of the things I was excited about was if I don't feel like using Bluetooth then I don't have to but that isn't the case. But that is the only downside for me, overall I'm very happy and would buy these again. I will update this review if that changes though.",4,1,2017-11-30,1,0,0
"My husband loves these! (I do too, since I don't have to listen to his television at high volume!)He has tinnitus and hearing loss, so this is a great option for us both.

"I recently purchased these headphones when my other ones broke. I read a few articles and reviews but decided to try them out.If you live in a noisy place, these headphones don't really mute out the noise of the surrounding environment. I can still hear every conversation being held in my subway car and the call quality is great if I have nothing to say, but if you want to actively participate, you are often not heard (as several of my phone call participants have said.) They are good if you are on a budget and need something quickly, but even for the price, they are pretty underwhelming.",4,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
I really like the noise cancelling feature. I can hear my music great. The only thing I'm not sure of is I have to keep my Ipod really close to the headphones or it flicks in and out. Not sure if the distance is due to the iPod or the headphone capabilities. I didn't have that problem when I wore my older ones.,4,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"There comfortable I'll give them that, but the materials they wore made out of wore cheap, no metal all plastic one drop broke the swivel in the right headphone and one more drop broke the left one and the right size adjuster and these drops wornt that far up just about 2-3 feet above a wooden floor. Sound quality was meh noise canceling was horse crap it got rid of almost all the bass, tho there wasn't to much bass to begin with. I dident run into any problems with the bluetooth so that's good.

"Was away on vacation and I broke my headset. In panic mode I went straight to amazon looking for a new headset, and was looking for something wireless and of good quality at an affordable price. I saw this COWIN headset and before purchasing checked out some reviews which legitimized them as a good product. I loved the look so I ordered them.Since receiving them I have been absolutely in love with them, the wireless charge seems almost everlasting and the quality is tremendous! I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend these to anyone looking for a good headset. The sound is powerful and the noise cancellation feature is perfect.",5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,0
"Are these better than Bose QuietComfort 35's?  No.  But they're $200 cheaper too.  Great value for the money.  If you want a headset that works reasonably well to block out aircraft noise, good audio quality, and can use for concalls - get this.  You won't feel so angst-ridden if you leave these on the plane, hotel, cab, or at a customer on-site visit.  One of those rare times when the quality really exceeds your expectations.",5,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
"I use the headphones for online conference calls that often are an hour or more. The cushion on the ear peace and adjustable head strap I guess it is called make it very comfortable to wear. Great quality sound and makes it easier to hear the most quiet of speakers, much better than standard computer sound speakers. They have a great look very classy. Not quite sure yet how to control the sound on the head set itself, seems like mine isn’t doing anything but I may have something not adjusted in settings on the computer I have had these a little under a month I think or maybe a month so still figuring them out. But they serve the purpose and function well.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"These are great wireless headphones for the price. The charge lasts a long time, for me a few weeks, and I use them everyday for at least 4-5 hours working from home.

I recommend them for the price, its a good deal, nice product.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"So far, I've been using the headsets for over 1 month. I use them at work and for my gym sessions. In the beginning, I thought I was only able to use them at work since I didn't want them to get bad odor; however, to my surprise, it doesn't smell bad, obviously, I clean it a little bit after use. But overall, it works perfectly while I'm at the gym. It's no the best headsets for running; but, for the rest it's fine.I'm not too demanding with sound quality, they sound good, not the loudest headset; however, it works for me. The battery is something that I really like, there is no need to charge them daily. HOWEVER, I didn't the fact that you can only know the battery % if you are using it with an iPhone. There is no way to know how much battery life is remaining. Also, you can't use them wire if it isn't charged.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,1

"Wonderful headphones. They fit and feel great for prolonged use. Takes some time to get used to though, I did feel nauseous at first, but that goes for any noise cancelling headphone. Now I use them daily on the bus and they make a world of difference. Cancels out most of the low droning sounds like the engine, but can’t cancel higher pitch noises like the ACs whine. Sound quality is less when noise canceling is activated, but when using them as regular headphones, they’re great. Pairs to phone quickly and easy to set up. Also tells battery status on iOS devices, while some android phones can pair by tapping with NFC.",5,1,2017-10-8,1,0,0

If they get lost or damaged you’re only out $80 instead of $350 for the pricier brands.  I would definitely NOT spend the extra money on the E7 Pro by the same manufacturer as there just doesn’t seem to be enough advancement in tech to justify the higher price.  I would buy these again.",4,1,2018-11-10,1,1,0
SAMPLED TWO OTHER HEADPHONES. ONE PRICED AT ALMOST $300.00 AND ONE AT $169.00.

Others on the other line can hear you pretty well and you can hear them back with no effort.The E7 is bulky, but that is expected being an over ear headphone.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I drive a lot for work and didn't want earbuds because the can hurt after awhile.  Easy to bluetooth pair, has microphone to use for calls.  When listening to youtube, can skip ahead and pause with the button.  They are sooo compfortable like having two pillows on both sides of my ears.  Do a great job cancelling outside noice. Slightly plasticy, but sturdy.  I would recommend the purchase.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0

I love how comfortable these are - ear buds usually hurt my ears so these headphones are a delight.  The sound quality is excellent.  I primarily use them for phone calls and the quality is fine with that.  I have tried them with audio music and they work well but I haven't listened to music often enough yet to say much about music quality.  I'm very satisfied with these headphones!,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
I love these headphones. They came packaged in a very nice box with foam padding. They connect quickly every time. The bass is outstanding! The sound is very clear. I get no crackling. Noise cancelling is great when something is actively playing on the headphones. Very comfortable and I wear glasses.,5,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0

These are definitely worth the money. I use in the locomotive cab when i am working which can get very noisy. The Bose has a better noise canceling but are so much more expensive. The sound when listening to music is great! Nice bass.Edit* Iam adding another star making this 5 stars! They quit working after almost a year and they replaced them no questions asked! They have a customer for life in me!,5,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
I bought these because I hate putting earphones in my ears. I used them everywhere (walking to class and gym). I ended up giving them away because they kept making a clicking noise in my ear when I moved as if there were a loose part inside. Does not cancel noise but simply cups your ears and you can turn the volume loud enough so that you can't really hear anything. I gave them to my dad and he just uses them at the computer so he has no complaints. Not worth $50. More like $20-$30. The sound quality of these is still better than your average earphones probably because of the cupping effect.,3,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
These headphones are wonderful. They are bulky but I don’t mind because they fit comfortably even with glasses on.Volume is extremely high to a point that they are better than my Asus computer. I don’t even realize it until my spouse lets me know.,5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"I was impressed with the package quality ensuring safe arrival of the contents.  The headphones charged out of the box in less than 2 hours and on first use was impressed with the sound quality for the price.  The active noise cancelling is far more effective on low range sounds like the hum of a fan or rumble of a car motor, but they don’t cancel out all background noise.  Since I’ve never owned a noise canceling product Before these Ican’t honestly compare their effectivness to other brands.  I did try on several Bose models at our local Best Buy and didn’t think there was that much of a difference.  So far we are pleased with our purchase",4,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"Look no further then these headphones for your daily use, they were made by audio engineer bill cowin, and have the sound worthy of the name. The bass is deep and punchy vocals are also crystal clear. I listen to music almost daily for work these headphones suited my needs. They are Bluetooth with an option to hookup direct, handsfree voice calling is crystal clear with no issues. You don't need $100 headphones if you have these.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Overall I like these headphones. The battery life is awesome! The noise cancelling feature on the first pair I got didn't work quite as well as I'd like it to. That being said, it is possible it was just the pair I got. I wrote the company about this and they gave me a code to buy new ones through Amazon (due to their 18th month warranty, I only had to pay $0.50 for the new pair and they'll reimburse you). Unlike some companies, the process of getting a replacement was super easy! I just got a new pair in the mail last night, so hopefully they will prove to be better with the noise cancellation.",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I want to love these headphones. Great price for the quality of sound and noise cancellation. However, regardless of whether they are charged or plugged in or not - the same maddening reminder to ""please charging"" repeats every 5 minutes or so, disrupting my train of thought or causing me to miss whats being said in meetings. Because of this, I can't use them...",2,1,2020-8-27,1,1,0
"These were a pleasant surprise for use in the office.  I work in an open office area which can become quite noisy.  I can use these with the  bluetooth feature to listen to music or a podcast and the noise cancellation feature is great when I need quiet to focus on a project.  I certainly recommend these, my coworkers and executive leader have also purchased them.

"I love these headphones loads. They sound so good. The battery lasts a long long time. I almost returned them because they got hot while I was outside and they're bit bulky.

These head phones sound horrible..honestly I’m not an audiophile or very demanding when it comes to listening to music however I was hoping for a better listening experience.

"I ordered a pair of white and a pair of black.  I received white and BLUE.  Not sending back, because I need them for work now.  Also, not really noise cancelling.  More like a mild noise muffling.  This is about the same as using a pair of ear muffs. I didn't want to feed music in, was trying to block out the loud music at work.  Disappointed, I guess I should have bought a higher quality.",1,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
I got these to use for work-at-home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I was looking for something that would help in tuning out the distractions of the family so that I could concentrate on serving my clients.  I will say that the built-in mic is a little sensitive as it was picking up a decent amount of background noise.  But they still worked and worked well.When paired to my phone the music sounded great.,4,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"This is the best headphones I've bought. For the price, they sound, feel and look fantastic. Used them on my trip to Europe last summer and the batteries have a good life. The noise cancelling option works very well, it even cancelled the airplane noise.",5,1,2018-11-15,1,1,0
"These are completely unusable. Sound comes through like they are speakers (no exaggeration). Anyone and everyone nearby will hear every syllable. I tried testing how low I had to put the music to not hear it come through and it was level 2 and then when I put the headphones back on, I couldn’t hear anything at all! So either everyone’s listening to your music or no one is. It’s awful. I don’t understand all the high reviews because this issue makes the headphones completely unusable. Maybe I got a faulty set, but will be returning ASAP.Also, the noise cancellation quality is not that great either. It’s not the worst but certainly not the best.",1,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"These headphones have some SERIOUS cushion around them.  They are a tad on the heavy side, if I wear them for long periods of time (like to watch a movie or whatever).  But I LOVE the fact that they are bluetooth friendly and I don't have to get twisted up in a cord.  It drowns out sound around me, and I can listen to one thing, while sitting next to my husband who is watching football on the computer.",5,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
Very good price vs Bose ...but quality understandably weaker - mid range strong - NOT good noise cancellation- sound with volume mostly high works fine but I wear them at the gym and in between songs I can easily hear the tv others have on - much clearer than others for the same price,4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I have to say I'm very surprised how great these sound. They seem very comfortable so far, connection was quick and easy and again for the price they sound great.

I have spent about triple the listening time troubleshooting. Will not connect to bluetooth no matter which remedy I try. I can use them wired but what's the point? My cheap $9 wired pair not only work but I can fall asleep with them on due to being so comfortable. The heavy C7 moves around my head. If I lay down they fall down. What a waste..,2,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0

I like the sound of these Cowin E7's and the fit as well.  I can wear them directly on the head or over my my baseball cap and they are comfortable either way.

I have had these for a few months now so I believe I can give an accurate review now. These headphones are comfortable and the noise cancellation works well but.... after about a month or two they seemed to suddenly drop in sound quality for no reason. The audio constantly bounces between ear to ear making them very annoying to use and more recently they have been making an annoying cracking sound in the left ear. I never damaged or dropped them they just started acting strange by themselves.,2,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0

Decent headphones for the money. It has a good sound for the price range. It reduces noise but doesn't cancel out completely.

Sound wise, it's pretty average, nothing really mind blowing. Music sounds good but I can't have the headphones on for longer than 30 minutes at a time. For travel, these headphones would probably be great as the noise cancellation is very good.

I'm gluing them with epoxy again with duct tape wrapped around the joint.Just a bad design. It looks cool to rotate the ears and sits more comfortably at the neck, but it's a poor design.

So because of all of these issues, I decided to refund them. But the people at Cowin read my review and gave me an optimized pair thats sounds like a quality pair of headphones!This is how you know that this is a good audio company; when they read the feedback given by the buyers and take action off of it.

I was looking for wireless over-ear headphones so I could watch TV at night and not worry about waking up my family and this was perfect for that.  Easy to connect and sound was great.  On a few occasions the connection wasn't clear but I've had issues with other wireless headsets so I don't think it's an issue with this product.  I would recommend if you are looking for a budget product that's high quality.,5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"These have held up well.  Handle them right and put them in provided pouch after use.  The only slight recommendation would be to have slightly more adjustability for smaller heads.  If I lie back, the headset will start to slide back off my head.  End up having to wear the headband across my forehead in this position.",4,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0
"These are excellent introductory noise cancelling headphones. The quality is very good and they sound great.After a few hours of use, they tend to feel heavy and rub my ears funny. So I give myself a break every hour or so.",5,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
Very nice headsets. ANR works well and the Bluetooth link is a nice feature. Comftorable clamping pressure and didn't bother me after long flights. Only one odd thing I have found is that when you plug it in to something (like when you are on a plane and plug into their entertainment system)The ANR goes off. It happens as soon as you plug the cord in to the headset.,4,1,2017-7-6,1,0,0
I wasn't sure what to expect when ordering this set of Cowin E7 headphones.  I have not been disappointed with the quality of the sound and the amazing noise cancelling feature.  I enjoy the ability to close out the surrounding distractions and enjoy the pure sound that these headphones deliver. The run time after a full charge seems to be good as well.

"Updated Review - Cowin contacted me about the problems I experienced with the first set of headphones received. Their customer service is top notch. They offered a full refund or a replacement set. I received the repacment set within two days and am very pleased.The noise cancelling has never worked. They paired easily and look nice, but a huge reason for purchasing was for the NC feature which hasn’t worked from day 1.",4,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0
"As I was previously using a terrible hand-me-down pair of airbuds, these Cowin are great. Decent noise canceling even without using that feature and it’s so refreshing having the battery last days instead of 1.5 hours!

"I wanted to use my Classic Ipod with my almost 5,000 songs on it with a cordless headphone.  I bought the Baile Bluetooth Transmitter IPF01 30 pin and attached it to the bottom of my ipod.  I bought the Cowin E7 Bluetooth Headphones,charged it for two hours and synced the ipod to the headphones.  It was a piece of cake!  Unbelievably great sound-treble and bass. It rivals anything that I have ever heard on headphones. You can't control the volume on the ipod. But it was so easy to control the volume on the headphones by holding down the - or the + sign.  I take these to the gym so I can be cordless and listen to all my great songs!",5,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
"I fly a lot for work, these come in very handy to make the flights more enjoyable. Not a Bose or Sony, but I can tell you from comparing this to my co-workers that this one comes close enough in my books, especially considering the price.

"My friend Nancy says she loves, loves, loves things. I thought it was excessive until I got the Cowin headphones. In this case, I love, love, love them. The noise canceling feature is terrific. I synced the headphones to my iPad and rewatched Breaking Bad. You could hear things out of frame like Gus Fring walking away, opening and closing his car door and starting the engine.While I had the headphones on I waited to hear the AC kick on. I never heard it until I removed the headphones. Also I was delighted to have the cable. I don’t download music or movies so on an upcoming international flight I can plug into the screen. And pairing was easy. We oldsters like that.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"The COWIN E7 Bluetooth Active Noise Cancelling Headphones are worthy of my five star rating because of the sound, fit, comfort, and battery length.  My most recent use of the headphones was on a five-hour plane trip across the U.S.  The sound was strong, and only got better once the active noise cancelling feature was turned on.  The background faded away and all I could hear was the music, movies, and podcasts queued up.  The headphones stayed comfortable throughout the entire trip, and I didn't feel the need to take them off to give me ears a break like I did with previous headphones.  For the value, you can't go wrong with the Cowin E7 Bluetooth Active Noise Cancelling Headphones.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"I've used these headphones for one week. Experience to date is sound quality is excellent, but a little too much bass for me. Had a little trouble at first getting used to the volume adjustment and skip forward/back, but seems fine now. Just a bit hard to get used to. If the controls had raised, (braille like), icons that would help. Overall, I like them and would recommend.",4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"The headphones work really well WHEN they work. I got my first pair and within 3 weeks they wouldn’t turn on. I charged them. Nothing. Read online that leaving them on for a day to let the battery run out, then charging them for a full day would restore power. Nothing. Customer service was great at sending a replacement at no cost to me. Now 6 months after owning that pair, same issue. I won’t request another pair because I’m tired of not having reliable headphones when I want to use them.",2,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"The sound is perfect. I use the earphones so not disturb neighbors at night as I prefer my music audible. My only problem lies with the volume control. It's hard to feel the control and also the minus (lower volume), is positioned forward where I feel it should be position in the rear of the triangle. A minor inconvenience.",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
I have been looking for a pair of wireless headphones that I could use with my laptop and also my phone.  The sound is nice and clear.  The only reason I gave 4 stars on the noise cancellation is because I can still hear a tiny bit of the TV when my hubby has it on.  I like that I can walk away from my laptop if watching a movie and still hear it even if I am not right in front of it.  Also I haven't pulled the laptop off the desk because I forget to unplug the headphones.  I wear these for MANY hours at a time and they are very comfortable.,5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
I used this a couple of times then it stoped working. I called the # on the box to help me try to see if I could get it working but she didn’t have a clue. I don’t recommend this at all. Also because I purchased it in October it’s too late to return it. I wasted a lot of money,5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"Good quality although noise cancelation does not block wind noise particularly well.  Very good product for the price. Good sound quality.  I mostly listen to digital books, so bass quality is not particularly important.  Actually have never listened to music with them.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I work in a coworking space and there are a lot of people talking (and one in particular that laughs and talks SO LOUD!). The E7's have worked great to cancel out a lot of that noise and play music with incredible sound. They are very comfortable and fit over my ears. I only wish they were a bit lighter, as my head isn't used to having something on them all the time yet.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"The clarity is amazing, I am satisfied with my purchase of the Cowin E7 Headphones!!! They have performed above my expectations. They arrived well-packaged, on time, the charge last longer than my previous brand - I can complete several hours of yard work without recharging- NICE",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"Overall, these headphones work very well.  The noise reduction is decent even without the active circuit.  They are comfortable enough for a few ours of wear time.  In my opinion the sound quality is better with the Noise Reduction(NR) circuit on.  With the circuit off, the bass is boomy, and makes the overall sound a bit muddy.  It over-shadows most of the other elements in the music.  With the NR on, the bass is tighter and more well defined.  It has a more even equalization with a punchy bass.",4,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0

"These are very good headphones. Right away, once I put them on, I noticed the drop in sound. I'd say that, without any noise, around 60-70% of the noise is blocked out. Coupled with some light music/white noise, almost all noise is blocked out. Extremely helpful for the nights when my floormates are loud, or construction workers might be working outside of where I live.Furthermore, they are quite comfortable. While they're definitely not the comfiest pair I've ever owned, I can easily wear them for hours on end without feeling like I need to take them off because my ears are starting to get squished. The muffs go around the ear itself, so it's quite comfortable.",5,1,2017-10-22,1,0,0
"I listen to books or music, as I mow.  When I finish, I feel like I can't hear correctly and worried about hearing loss.  My earbuds did nothing.  When I purchased these, I was amazed!

"I purchased these headphones about a month ago and have used them several times and they are excellent Bluetooth headphones for the price.  They come packaged well, look and feel of a quality design.  I like the swivel feature to the ear cups which make them a custom fit.  The sound quality is quite good with pretty deep base and no distortion.  the noise canceling function works and I am looking forward to using them on a airline flight next month.  The battery life is good, about 8 continuous hours.  They are also very comfortable, padding on the headband is a nice feature as well as the padded cups and also surprisingly light weight..",5,1,2017-2-10,1,1,0
These headphones were a great price and I was surprised at how well they work. I love that they have Bluetooth so I no longer have to walk around with a cord attached to me! They are very comfortable and I can wear them for the entire day and they never bother my ears or head. They do pretty well at keeping sound out. If you're listening to a book on tape though you will still be able to hear if people are talking loudly in the background. Battery charge seems to last for a good 8 hours before needing to be recharged.,5,1,2017-7-7,1,0,0

I have not tested the noise canceling ability yet.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

These give clear quality sound, long battery life at an excellent price.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0

"My wife and I travel a lot and we both hate the noise of airplanes but didn't want to pay a huge amount for a set of Bose headphones.  Our trip to Ireland is coming up soon, but I have found a use for my new COWIN E7 headphones.  I spend quite a bit of time in the yard using a riding lawn mower, blower, string trimmer, etc.  When you listen to music with earbuds or regular headphones while on a riding law mower you have turn up the volume so loud that it is a shock when you turn off the mower.  I had actually given up with headphones doing yard work when I decided to use my Cowin E7.  They are comfortable and cut the outside noise so much that you can actually hear your music.",5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
"I probably should have read the description better, but I was disappointed with these. Every pair of noise-cancelling headphones I've had in the past have had battery-powered noise-cancelling mode, with ""on"" being noise cancelling on and ""off"" meaning they work as regular, not-noise cancelling headphones, but with these, you have ""off"", ""on"", and ""noise-cancelling"", so even listening without the noise-cancelling feature runs on battery. The battery life is very short. Also, when I wear these when walking, they seem to bounce and I hear a noise every time I take a step which is irritating.On the plus side, they are fairly comfortable and sound ok for the price point.",3,1,2018-8-2,1,0,0
This headphone was purchased for my son. He suggested I give them a try and I was quite impressed. They stayed securely on my head and are amazingly comfortable.The sound quality was great for me.

I plan to buy one when my budget allows.,5,1,2017-4-7,1,0,0

You can still hear some noise but that is expected, overall the noise isolation was good.Cons: The volume control on the headset never worked for me.

Great product!  I can shut out all the activity going on around me.  One thing - because I can't use wireless - there is no wifi signal, I plug in to a CD player.

Not scientific research, but that is my impression. Sound is ok, but not better them monoprice.Another inconvenience is turn on/off hard switch.

I've not used customer service so far but if needed, I'm confident they'll provide the support I expect.  If you're in the market for a quality over-the-ear headphone at an affordable price, consider this first.",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0

"I have used the headphones for around 6 weeks. I use them at least 3 & 4 hours on the weekend. So far I have not had to recharge them. Noise cancellation very good and the sound quality excellent. I use them to  mow my lawn. The edger, Trimmer and Lawn Mower noise is cancelled for the most part.",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"Good quality overall. Bass isn't what I needed. I got the Skull Candy headphones, where you can manipulate the bass on the headphones. And it hits way better.

This does exactly what I was looking for. If gives me noise cancellation while traveling. At the same time I can connect Bluetooth to my phone or via aux connection to the airline entertainment system. Sounds great in noise canceling mode.Only things that I would change/correct:,4,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0
It cancelled the noise out for me as the wearer but I used them at work for 2 weeks before someone told me that they could hear every word of what I was listening to as they walked by. (!!!) Sure enough I tested them on someone else and even at a reasonably quiet volume the sound carries well past the wearer. So embarrassing! Sitting collecting dust in my drawer now because it was too late to return them by the time I found out.,1,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"From opening the elegant box, the ease of directions to set headphones to my computer, comfort of ear pads and the sound...I love these headphones.

It does cancel out a little bit of noise, but I would say it's main strong point is the sound quality.if you are even remotely close to someone who's wearing them, you can easily hear what they're listening to.  I would say this is a weakness.",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
Very nice cans. I shopped for months looking at much more expensive headphones and couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger. After reviewing the Cowin E7 ANC headphones I was convinced to give them a closer look. See I'm in my 60s and hearing high tones at this age requires quality. I'm very satisfied with my decision.  Fit well and sound great. Setup was easy.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I have two sets of these.  My second set has failed, but it's probably not a defect.  These were my workout headphones.  After about two months they stopped working, but it's probably because I sweated with them on too much, too often.

But that could just be me and my ears not noticing it?Great sound quality, when the volume gets to high the bass gets distorted but other than that I feel they're definitely worth the money. The plastic coverings made to look metal feel cheap, would of preferred them to actually be metal. Otherwise the build quality sees great for the first night I used it.",4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

"This is my second pair of the Cowin headphones. The headphones are great .. especially for the price and ound quality .. BUT these headphones have a flaw that you can easily make up for. My first pair lasted about 6 months. There is a weakness where the headpiece is supposed to swivel. If you look at other reviews, that part tends to separate. I solved this by taking electical tape and wrapping several layers around the base making a solid tight connection. I don't need the swivel. My second pair is still going strong. Everything else is good. My friends have even complimented me on the design. It looks more expensive than it is.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"I've used these a ton. Between connecting to my phone and my computer they're on me almost 24/7 between games, youtube, audiobooks and music they're superb. Being able to control my music right from my headphones to do some quick skips or volume changes is such a ""I didn't know I wanted that"" feature.The only real downside is the bar that connects the ear-cups to the headband seem to break the most often, which causes them to rise off your ear and, besides being painful, spill out sound but they're otherwise super dependable and useful making purchasing another well worth it.",4,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0

Originally bought these for a friend 11 months ago.  He uses them every day to work out in and listen to music.  Being a music major he says the sound is awesome.

"I have purchased two of these. The sound quality and all was alright (given the price), however, these broke down within two months of normal use. Basically one of the earpads loosened up and broke down and now it cannot stay on my ears (and plus there is no audio in that earpad). Given, there is a warranty, I contacted the manufacturer and Amazon both within the time. Amazon requested to check with the manufacturer and raise a refund request with them directly. I contacted the manufacturer (cowin) directly. However, I got no response from the manufacturer despite multiple emails. So I am now left with a broken pair of headphones with no recourse.",1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

The sound and feel of the headphones are great. The bluetooth functionality works well with my iphone. The only downside is the voice quality while you are on the phone, via bluetooth, could be better.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

I only gave noise canceling four stars simply because it’s not quite as effective as a different “namebrand“ pair that we own… However, The price is so significantly less that far out weighs one lost star in noise canceling ability!",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
We bought two pair of these headphones for airplane travel. The previous headphones we owned were nearly the same price but the volume was not suitable and were not noise-cancelling. These Cowin E7 have very good volume and noise-cancelling abilities. On our first plane trip we were both VERY happy with this purchase.,5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
These are very high end expensive looking and sounding headphones. I literally can’t hear anything else when I have the noise cancelation on.  They are very comfortable to wear at the gym and don’t make my ears hot or too sweaty which is a plus. I tried a ton of headphones before making this purchase.. even beats.. and the sound quality of these plus the volume is far superior than all the others I tested out.

"Doesn’t get very loud, but the noise canceling works quite well.One thing I didn’t realize... they’re not very cool looking.  Also, running/jogging is near impossible with them, as the noise canceling pillowed ear portion slides on and off your ears, creating an uncomfortable suction feeling on your ears. So there is that.",4,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

"Just received mine. Noticed while going through the manual that it says, ""Will not play while charging."" That seems like a major design flaw. That means if you are listening to something and the battery dies you are out of luck and cannot listen to anything until they are charged again. Also, if the battery completely goes and will no longer take a charge you are stuck with a useless headset. Again, big flaw in the design.",3,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0

These are fantastic! I toggled between turning the noise cancelling on and off in different situations (in the car, inside by the ac, etc.) and the quality of the noise cancellation is fantastic!

I haven't heard these die on me yet and use them a majority of the day.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
Not for people with big ears. I really like these headphones but I have big ears and they don’t fit inside the pads so they push on my ears.

Not overly impressed with these headphones. I don't own or ever purchased a pair of headphones or earbuds over $60. My first impression is how much plastic is used to make these headphones which makes them look and feel cheap. The Bluetooth connected without issue.

I did a fair amount of research online before buying and many sources steered me to Cowin. This is my second pair.

Not only that, I can roam around the house listening to whatever I want without having to carry an iPhone or whatever with me.  It has about a 30-foot range which works well if your blue tooth source is sitting in the middle of your home.  It has a battery life 3 1/2 times longer than most headphones however I can't provide testimony about that because I usually let it sit charging while I'm not using it.  The battery has never run down while I've used it, up to ten hours.  This is the best birthday gift I've ever bought myself.",5,1,2017-10-2,1,0,0
I bought these to listen to music. Sadly my earbuds sound much better. I called a friend and he said my voice sounded like I was talking into a tin can.  I am returning.,2,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"Having written a similar review, Cowin sent me another set to try. No change to my opinion or rating. Cowin did leave me to keep the replacement. They're ok, but not comfortable to wear for very long. I am comparing them to Bose QC25s, so they have a lot to live up to. I can't really speak to the battery life. I haven't used them enough.",2,1,2018-11-30,1,8,0
"They are good, but if you want good quality, then you have to pay for it (unfortunately) I use a zero turn lawn mower and my lawn mower drowned out the sound. My skull candy ear buds are the best by far. They work well for simple tasks like vacuuming, but not for heavy duty tasks.",3,1,2019-6-14,1,1,0
"I bought the Cowin E7 after receiving a glowing recommendation from my partner. I had to replace my old wired noise cancelling headphones when I upgraded to a bluetooth only cell phone.What I really like are the extra features: I can pause, go back a bit, go forward a bit, increase and decrease the volume all at a touch.  It fits well over my ears. I highly recommend this product.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
Can use to watch movies on air travel instead of headset provided. Just log into plane internet with your phone. Noise cancelling leaves you more refreshed at end of your trip. Also good for driving on freeway in rain storms with lots of trucks. Survival gear.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"The battery life on these headphones is amazing. After about 20 hours (total time actively listening) they are still at 70%! The sound quality is also great--definitely a step up from my previous headphones, where the bass used to get somewhat muddy. For the price, these can't be beat!",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I was very surprised at the sound that this headset puts out.  If you listen to music outside or inside with any background noise, the noise cancelling feature does bring out the lower notes. With it activated you notice a big difference. For the price you cannot go wrong at all.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"I was highly pleased when I got these headphones.  A very good price,  good sound and fairly satisfactory noise cancellation.  And I was about to grade it up to 5 star when It started not to hold a charge -- Now I have to send them back in..  Make sure you register them -- through the app -- because apparently they have a 90 day replacement guarantee -- just a bit skittish about the battery issue....",3,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
UPDATE!!I spoke with someone in customer service about the issue I was having with these headphones. She was so happy to help and quickly resolved the issue. I highly recommend this company.,5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"These are very good for their price point.  Great for lawn mowing music and noise cancelling.  Everyone I let use them comments on how good the sound is and hears new nuances in their music they already know.Haven’t done any phone conversations with these to comment on microphone quality other than it works.  One call tried, it worked.",4,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"I received the product in perfect condition, loved it as soon as I connected it to my phone. I receive a lot of compliments when I'm out with them, the design great. Comfortable ear padding, easy to pair with devices and stays connected over a reasonable distance, and an efficient battery life (though a sleep mode would also e great, but that's just a bias.) They can also, thankfully, take a fall though I highly do not recommend making a habit of dropping them. The sound quality is remarkable, though the noise cancellation is just okay for the price you buy them at. There will be hiccups when driving over bumpy roads. Don't get me wrong, they get the job done on long walks through busy areas and public transportation; Something I greatly appreciate with my anxiety. Recently one of the swivel on my pair broke, and I'm honestly considering buying a new pair for travel comfort.",5,1,2018-4-29,1,0,0

"Just wow!  These headphones are superb for this price!  Great treble, and bass is perfect (not muffled or dull). I use them a lot.  I also use them when I mow my lawn with my tractor.  I can actually hear the music over the loud motor thus making my mowing an enjoyable event.  Being a music lover, these are paradise!",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
Works  good when paired with the wireless adapter that I required for use with my non Bluetooth TV.Fairly priced.,4,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"Very comfy for extended use, and your gonna get it with the extreme battery life this unit has. The sound quality is excellent for the price point and the noise cancellation a dream. It does lack a compact transport option as the unit does not fold up, but I haven't had any issues with that in my day ti day use. If you're struggling to decide whether or not to pick up this product my recommendation is you give it a shot. If you're experience is anything like mine you wont be disappointed.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"I've purchased headphones in this price range before with better sound, but these are easily the most comfortable pair I've owned.Edit: About a year in one of the point of articulation became loose due to regular use and caused the earpiece to no longer sit snugly against my head. While it seems I am not alone in having this happen the warranty is great and I received a new pair almost immediately after talking to a customer service representative. Hopefully this new pair holds up better but I can still recommend both the headphones and the company that makes them for handling everything so exceptionally.",4,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
"This was a huge upgrade from the earbuds I've usually used. I don't have a comparison with similar style headphones, but I'm very happy with these. I do sometimes find that they glitch a bit in their bluetooth connection. Overall, I'd recommend this product.",4,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"I liked the headphones. They seemed like a quality product.However, after using them for 2 days, I could not get the volume control to increase. They were just too low. I let other family members try them and they all agreed that there was not enough volume.",2,1,2020-7-13,1,1,0
"This product exceeded my expectations. I did not expect it to completely silence the outside world but for it to become almost completely tuned out once I was listening to something through them. The noise cancelling feature  worked well to greatly cut down noises around me and to allow better focus and concentration which was my goal. They are very comfortable and easy to set up the Bluetooth connection. They are lightweight and attractive and last many hours after being charged. Not to mention a great price for the value, I recommend it highly.",4,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"I got these because my roommate in the rehab place (broken ankle) was hard of hearing and had her tv turned way up. These did not cancel out that noise, or people talking. But the sound quality is excellent. Just understand that they won't block the noise from tv's or people",4,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"Did not do the job for me, go with the E7 pro or the E8 pro, E7 pro which works very well. I could not hear myself scream in the E7 proSound quality is great good base",2,1,2019-4-3,1,2,0
"Noise cancellation does not work well, but I use mine on public streets and city buses - I can hear the audiobook I am listening to. the voices around me are somewhat muted or scrambled, but in case of danger, I am still significantly aware of my surroundings.",4,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"I really like these headphones. The sound is great - a little bass-ey for my taste, but then I'm a musician and like a fully balanced sound. It's ok, not a deal-breaker. Did I say how light and comfortable the set is? Nice... I would recommend these to anyone.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"Not wanting to spend $300+ for brand name noise cancelling headphones, I bought these for cheap and WOW!  For less than $50... these have great audio and bass quality.  My only issue is their size...they are bulky and not the most comfortable if trying to sleep with them (on an airplane).  But consider the cost.  For what I use these for, they are perfect and the price is a great value.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"Purchased January 24, 2020.  Product worked as expected and was a decent value for the price.As of September 14, 2020 they will no longer enter pairing mode nor pair with any device.

Great product but lasted 5 months.  Now it starts and stops. Sound quality not there anymore.I was very impressed by the fact that the company cared enough to make things right. They exchanged these headphones and sent me another higher quality pair. I just received them yesterday and already used them. So far so good. thank you for reaching out.,5,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0
"For the price...they are great. Haven’t had them long so not sure on their reliability yet. They sound decent and the noise canceling is okay at best, but at this price you can’t beat em.

I travel 3 weeks out of the month and decided to try these pair of noise-cancelling headphones out. I was very pleased when they arrived on time and as requested.

"Not as sleek as bose 35 ii; can’t do multiple blue tooth at the sane time as bose, but the noise canceling is just as good and the sound is definitely better (bose very muddy)For $80 versus $299 for Bose you can’t beat the Corvin Save your money, don’t pay for the Bose name",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I use these primarily for audiobook listening, so my requirements are decidedly non-audiophile.

Battery Life is also excellent,",4,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"We got 2 Pairs of the Cowin E7 Noise Cancelling Headphones.  Our primary reason for purchasing was the Noise Cancelling feature.  The sound quality can’t be beat!!!!

Don’t hesitate to buy these, the quality and price point simply can’t be beat.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"I love these, I use them at work to block everybody out. They are big and obvious, so people know I can’t hear them and leave me alone. I listen to 80’s Rock and Classical and the sound is great.

"Ridiculously good for the price.  Bought these for my son who now has to do Zoom home schooling because of the pandemic.  Use them on the ipad.  Mic works, sound quality is good, long battery life, and they are comfortable.  Piece of cake to hook up via Bluetooth.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"I use these for indoor rowing. I do about an hour a day and use the headphones to connect with my tv. They really work well, I can hear the tv very well over the rower noise and the battery life is excellent. Very comfortable and recommended these without any qualifications.",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

It comes with a leather pouch for storage and transportation, a USB cable for charging and a cable for audio when not using Bluetooth.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"The strap over the head has the best padding of the four pair I ordered. The ear parts are well padded and swivel for a perfect fit. They were also two to three times more expensive than the other pairs, but I find the extra 30-40 bucks is worth it for a long term purchase.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
These just arrived today which only took 2 days Amazon is amazing! Anyways I have no complaints these things are super comfortable they are built better than the jbl's that I just broke for the final time sound quality is excellent Comfort is excellent you can even hook it up to your TV I think it's pretty cool. For the money I'm not trying to drop hundreds of dollars because I use these for everything from mowing the lawn to going to work. Anyways I highly recommend these you won't be sorry,5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,1
This is the best set of noise cancelling headphones I've ever owned.  Easy to operate and superb sound quality.  Simple user instructions and hi-fidelity response for easily affordable headphones.  True value returned for moderate cost.  I would buy again.,5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
Update: The headphones broke past the return date. The seller made it right though. Overall the headphones weren't bad and with customer service like that they're definitely worth taking the chance. Updating to give starts just for stellar customer service if nothing else. They do have great sound quality and are comfortable in use.,5,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"I got these because our office is moving and we will be scrunched together in tiny cubicles. I expected these to completely cancel out noise, which was a little wishful thinking, but it does reduce the noise drastically.  It's going to work well and is comfortable to wear. Love the colors too!",4,1,2018-4-19,1,1,0
"I really love these headphones. They're very comfortable, have a very nice sound quality, and weren't super expensive like Bose. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the sound crackles and cuts out for a moment. It happens when connecting to either my tablet or my phone. Sometimes simply reconnecting helps. Other times it doesn't. Overall, still a good product.",4,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
Purchased these on sale for $35 a few months ago and I am impressed. Wore them for 6+ hours while doing yard work and still had plenty battery-life. Are they headphones you would wear in a recording studio .... NO. But they are really good for normal everyday use.,5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
This is the first time that with my wife or myself has been able to hear the television well enough to enjoy it since our hearing degraded. (Two or three years now) I have hearing aids but they don’t clarify the sound and my wife was diagnosed as unable to be helped by hearing aids.  As soon as we tried one we purchased a second one.,5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I went from never using headphones to always wearing headphones around my home thanks to these. Love the sound quality. I love how it seals out external noises without needing to use the noise-canceling mode. I think the normal mode is actually better sounding than the noise-canceling mode. Great price, great product, and great customer support that has reached out to me since I purchased.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Worked fine for about 5 months then one side died and now the other only works when plugged in and you have to mess with the cable to get a connection.New Update: 5/14/18: The new set I got has broken at the base where the headphones swivel side to side. Since its still within the 18 months I have emailed support for a new pair under warranty. Still, with two broken in 13 months, I don't think I'll be buying another pair from Cowin.",3,1,2017-11-7,1,2,0
"My initial impression is very good.  I've only had the headphones a few days.  They are comfortable, easy to pair/use, and the sound quality is VERY good.  I haven't had time to really check battery life/durability, but I've been able to use them all week (maybe a total of 4-5 hours of playtime) from the initial charge.  I love how lightweight they are - comfortable.",5,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0
"I really like these headphones quite a bit. I have slight hearing impairment but I’ve heard more notes than I ever did with any other headset, including Bose. While playing FFXIV, it felt like I was hearing the music for the first time. I cried and spent an evening ignoring my fiancé as I enjoyed the music. He was really impressed at the quality.Noise canceling is good for plane noise (it kills the annoying engine sound) but it won’t perfectly cover up your very loud coworker that you can hear perfectly from 20 ft away when he’s on the phone. Hope this helps, definitely recommend it.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"**UPDATED**After reaching out to customer support about this issue I was sent a brand new set of headphones, even though the warranty had run out already. They got them to me in less than a week.

"You never really know how loud an airplane is until you take these off after a while.  Allowed me to watch the US Open and Netflix with volume on 3 compared to almost maxed out without.  Never had any others so can't compare to more expensive brands, but these are perfect to eliminate a slow steady hum--not so much for really loud voices.  Battery life has been excellent--just made it through a 3-hour layover and 4-hour flight and they're still working after having NC and BT engaged the entire time.  Haven't used the supplied cable yet, but it's kind of short.  All-in-all an excellent value and highly recommended.",5,1,2017-6-19,1,0,0
"Decent, definitely get your money's worth. Are they Bose sound worthy? No. Absolutely not. Are they worth your 70ish bucks. Yes. No extra batteries which is a good and bad thing. NC is obviously going to draw more power but sound quality is higher. With this comes suction issues. If your ear doesnt fit tightly within the cup you will be annoyed. Overall, I'm happy. They served their overseas purpose and hopefully will continue to do so.I've used these for workout purposes and on an airplane.  Great for both. Definitely cut out about 65 to 75% of airplane droning noise. I was able to fall asleep and cut out a distant baby cry.",4,1,2018-4-11,1,0,0
"I decided to go back to school but also knew I would need something to block out the background noise. These do that while connected to my laptop, cell phone or iPad.  I also used them while I was working remotely without much of an issue. The only concern was the ability for people to be able to hear me because it sounds like I’m in a tunnel. That wasn’t the reason I bought them so I am far from disappointed. My 17 year old borrowed them and wants a pair of his own over his brother’s headphones.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"I saw some reviews saying their headphones would cut in and out when walking or even just moving a little, I haven’t had any problem with that. The comfort is awesome, can wear them for a decent while without my ears feeling fatigued. Although the bass could be better, it’s definitely not bad for the price tag. As for build quality, it’s sturdy, but you can tell it’s not a $200 set. All in all I’m very pleased with them so far.",4,1,2018-6-7,1,2,0
These are the best over ear phones I have every purchased!  And I have bought a lot of earphones and earbuds over the years.

Blutooth devices can be hit or miss when it comes to sound quality. These really surprised me. They sound just as good as corded headphones. Would highly recommend.Update: We had some issues with the first set of headphones but Cowin and there great customer service took care of me and sent out a replacement set. My daughter is happy again. Thanks Cowin.,5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"These headphones have a good sound quality, and the noise cancelling works quite well.  I typically wear them while working in the office or when walking around downtown and they are very comfortable.  Sometimes I wear them for hours on end with no discomfort.  I also stuff them in my backpack a lot, and they are very durable.  However, I personally prefer my music to be loud most of the time, which is the only reason why I docked a star.  I turn the volume all the way up on my phone when using these with Spotify, and a lot of the time it's not as loud as I would like it.  Overall, these are solid, quality headphones.",4,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"Took a chance on these less expensive headphones instead of purchasing a high-end set and was highly impressed.  Unless you are very picky and comparing directly with a set of Bose headphones (or similar), you would think you are listening to a $200+ pair of headphones.  The look and feel are very stylish (just like the promo images).  Without using the noise cancelation feature, the headphones seal out outside sounds and you feel lost in the music.  While the noise cancelation feature is neat, is doesn't compare to the high end models, but it does help to remove random outside sounds.  Ultimately, I'd purchase again.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Given the bargain price of these headphones I would have expected to pay 3 times as much. They totally blew me away.  I use them primarily for listening to audiobooks and podcasts while I'm doing yard work. The noise cancellation lets me listen without cranking the volume up to an unhealthy level, while I'm using a gas powered mower or trimmer, or battery powered blower. I've used them on plane flights and they quiet the flight noise when I'm watching a movie on my tablet. Everything functions as advertised, but the quality and finish of the was an unexpected surprise. I'll look for other Cowin products in the future.",5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0

"I was in the market of purchasing Bluetooth over the ear headphones not only for my phone but my iPad pro. After doing some research and reading reviews, made the purchase and was anticipating in receiving them not only to drawn out the background noise when traveling, but to listen to music and watch videos without bothering anyone else in the house. The deep bass is what sold me as I listen to EDM. This allows me to feel as if being at the show.Another good quality is the battery life. Have only charged once and have had just over a month. Along with the charge staying is the built-in microphone.",5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0

I really can’t tell that these function as noise cancelling. I have another brand of headphones that are not noise canceling and I can’t really tell the difference.  There is too much metal (chrome) in this design. They are somewhat bulky and not very comfortable.  The Bluetooth function works fine.  Sound quality is ok.,3,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"It was good for a few months. Great sound. I loved the duration of the battery. Worked very well until one of the earpieces fell out from the other part. Tried to put it back but apparently is not fixable. If you are the kind of person who is really careful and don't have kids at home I would recommend, otherwise it is better to get other type.",3,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I absolutely love these headphones.  They aren't too heavy when wearing, the sound is awesome with great bass.  Noise cancelling is perfect (can't even hear my own annoying singing voice!).  They linked to my Bluetooth very easily so there was no stress in setting everything up (I have an iPhone XR).  Overall, I'd say this was well worth the money.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0

For its price it is unbeatable.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

They aren't too heavy and seem like they fit around my ears well enough not to crush them....Anyway, I looked around for a long time to find some good headphones like this, and so far I am very pleased with my purchase!",5,1,2017-4-10,1,0,0

Material of construction is kinda weak and feels like to you have to handle them with care.  But, what do you expect for $50?

I purchased them for use in my long conference calls as a consultant. The noise cancellation feature is really good at eliminating ambient noises, and the built-in microphone doesn't collect excessive ambient noise. My clients appreciate the clear communication and I do, too. Just as importantly, I value the long battery life, and that I don't suffer cauliflower ear at the end of a day. The headphones are very comfortable. This was my first Cowin product, but it certainly won't be my last.",5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"I really enjoyed the stylish purple color, the soft, cushioned earpad and how street and subway tunnel sounds were nearly drowned out. I didn't, however, use a protective bag, bc I usu don't, but maybe I should have this time. After about 8 months of wear, the leather started to tear, peel and slide.  These go in and out of gym bags and purses regularly, but other brands have lasted a bit longer before looking this ragged. I might buy these again bc the sound quality for wireless at this price is hard to beat or go back to hard shell foldables I've had in the past.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,0,1
The control on the earpiece doesn't work and is cheap quality. The headphones don't stay on my head once I sweat the slightest bit. They feel cheap and aren't really noise cancelling or very loud at all. Overall the best part about them is the battery life is long so at least you don't have to charge them daily. I should've spent $30 more and gotten name brand.,2,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"If you need headphones for listening only, these work well. Don’t buy this if you need it for conference calls or phone calls. The mic doesn’t work well, if at all, and when I called the company to help me fix it they said it has a terrible mic, they get complaints all the time, and I should just return it. So I did.",3,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I use this primarily for the noise isolation/cancellation and listening to radio while in the office and gym.  ANC is minimal, but noticeable - primarily low frequencies.  Some sounds that I would expect to be cancelled (train rail noises and vehicle tire hum) are not, but the over-the-ear isolation does a good job of reducing those.  The feedback that I have gotten when using it for phone calls is that it sounds like I am talking from the bottom of a barrel - too much bass, too little mid-and high range.",4,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0

"I am surprised that no one else had mentioned the issue.  The moment I had this headphone on and start walking around, there were very loud stomping sound in my ear which made me feel like I was walking like elephant, despite that I was tip toeing.  The connection to my iphone 10 feet away was not stable and the sound kept coming in and out, which was disappointing. I have couple of wireless earpods and never had connection issue.",2,1,2020-1-14,1,1,0
"I bought these headphones based on the reviews and great price, and have not been disappointed.  The sound quality is great and the headphones are quite comfortable on my ears, and not too heavy after hours of streaming on my iPad (and without having to charge the headphones after many hours of use).  I wish I was able to use the headphones while watching TV, but my TVs are just old enough to not have Bluetooth capability and the cable is not long enough to connect to the TV.  With that said, I’m very happy with my purchase!",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"As I bought two, one for each of my boys, both items had failure at the swivel. Note the joint where I had to Glue the joint / joints of the headsets together to allow continued use.

Will not buy another Cowin Brand.UPDATE: Had Cowin Customer service (Laurence) reached out to confirm honoring the warranty. They are replacing both headsets at no additional cost.

I had a injury to my ear so I have to be careful what I wear with my glasses on or it gets really uncomfortable. These are comfortable like most I have to take them off periodically but they are comfortable. Sound is pretty good in my opinion. The noise canceling with music crackles. Without music noise canceling makes everything quite. They block enough noise on without noise canceling on for me to enjoy music.. ( I run a saw so that should give you  and idea how well they block noise even without the noise canceling on) I'd recommend them I've no issues with constant use this last month.,5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0
Buy these seriously.  The unboxing experience was like way better than anything I have ever bought.  Then I held them and was like wow these seem pretty  awesome.  Then I listened to them and yeah 60 bucks is an insane deal for these.  Seriously buy them.,5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like these headphones for the price. Unfortunately the noise cancelling does not work well. Background noise results in the headphones producing low level amounts of low frequency sound.  It gets real annoying real quick.  As long as you’re listening to music you don’t really notice, but if you just want silence on the plane, these are not ideal.",2,1,2019-6-28,1,1,0
"They had a great sound and were really comfortable to wear. the battery lasted for a long time. The cups of the headphones were plastic and the block that stopped it from rotating all the way around broke pretty early on, but they held up well and the noise canceling was great. Especially since the cancelling was linked with the power instead of being independent you didnt have to worry about draining the battery by accidentally leaving the NC on.",5,1,2019-3-29,1,1,0
"I have these to my husband for Christmas after he hinted to me that he wanted noise canceling headphones. After doing some research on the different brands, I decided on these, and I’m happy I did. No, they are not Bose, but they are still excellent headphones with high quality sound, and they really did cancel outside noise. Only time I could hear my husband talking loudly right next to me was when there was a break in the music, and even then I could just barely hear him. I can’t speak for the longevity of these headphones, but right out of the box, we have been pretty impressed.",5,1,2019-1-13,1,0,0

I have received a replacement and am extremely pleased by the quality of the product and the way in which my complaints and concerns were addressed.

Will for sure be a returning customer and plan to order another pair as a gift!",4,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"They are ok for the price. It's pretty cheaply made with cheap material. You can't really tell if the noise cancellation actually works because with it off, no noise is passing through. Kind of hard to explain but it's not the best. The sound quality is decent. I wish it was a little louder with more bass. I tweaked the EQ on my phone but even then, it wasn't great. But if you're looking to spend not a lot of money, get these. They're worth the money. Just don't expect Bose quality. Also, a mobile app would be pretty cool. 3 out 5 stars.",3,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I picked these up after shopping around and reading reviews and glad I spent the time doing so, because it led me to this great pair of headphones.  Sounds quality and bass are excellent.  The comfort factor is great.  I spend most of my work days on calls and bought these for this purpose primarily, and I can go the whole day without issue.  I do take them off once in a while when my ears need some air, but it isn't that often.  Also, the noise cancelling is pretty good, but I'm comparing them to a set of Bose earbuds with active noise cancelling that's pretty hard to beat, so I'm a little biased.  For the price, you're getting good noise cancelling with this pair.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0

Sound quality is pretty decent for my music.3* for the product. Changing the overall rating to 1*. The vendor has contacted me multiple times to request that I change my review or delete it. I have asked them to stop contacting me but they haven’t.

I bought the Cowin E7 headphones for a a multiple state vacation trip we were taking. My husband has the new iPhone and needed bluetooth headphones and the Cowin E7 worked out great. For the price they do the job and worked better than our former noise cancelling devices. I do have to say they are soft and comfortable around the ears which made using them even more enjoyable.,5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0

These headphones were great right out of the package. They look nice and felt great on. Then we turned them on. The sound was nice but then it started cutting out. We thought maybe the phone was not in range even though it was in my back pocket. So I took it out of my pocket and held it in my hand. The headphones still made a noise like they were cutting out. We have returned these and don't plan on buying them again.,2,1,2018-8-17,1,1,0
The sound volume kept changing while I was keeping it wired and I had to constantly adjust it to make it 'normal' again. It was just very inconvenient and it has to be in Bluetooth/draining battery. Will be returning this item.,1,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
I bought these for my trip to Europe. I used them on the plane as well as a coach. Blocks out engine noise and reduces noise.

So the battery has been blowing my mind. The sound however will go in and out a little when moving around making me think it’s cause the connection strength to my devices isn’t that strong. However it’s super comfortable and has great noise cancellation,4,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0

"I've had these a couple of weeks now, and I gotta say that I have been blown away by their features, especially at this price point. The battery life was one point of worry I had pre-order, as all of my other sets of headphones have been wired (and Bluetooth traditionally eats batteries like a fat kid at an all you can eat).  I have charged these once in the 2 weeks I have used them, and have yet to get below 80% battery life per my phone. And I use these for a minimum of 2 hours every night doing everything from gaming to listening to music while doing housework in these.  For the price, I can't really see myself buying another set of headphones for everyday and travel use.",5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
"Using them as strictly headphones, they are amazing.The ""microphone"" built-in is an absolute joke. Also, if you have the microphone enabled, it changes the audio quality of the headphones from amazing to awful, and there's no way I've found to force it to use the ""E7 Stereo"" for audio & still use the microphone.",4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0

"Cowin E7 is user-friendly, definitely easy to use. Looks great with the sleek folding feature.

I was unsure about these at first. Oh. Man. I love them!  I spent countless hours trying to find the perfect headphones. I wanted something that was inexpensive yet awesome. These fit that bill. I wear glasses and have issues with headphones never feeling comfortable or being flat on my ears. These rear nicely and don't push against the arms of my glasses. They paid nicely with my Apple TV and my generic tv. I did need to get a Bluetooth adapter for my tv to make it happen but totally worth it.I also love how they fold 'flat'.,5,1,2017-1-29,1,1,0
"It was between these or a more expensive name brand (Bose). I ended up choosing these. I was really surprised with the noise cancellation feature.

I have accidentally left them on multiple times overnight and then still used them for multiple days before a recharge.

They look and feel great but the quality is beyond disappointing hope I can send them back. My 20$ wired skull candys out perform these any day,2,1,2020-9-25,1,1,0
There wasn't good acoustics with these headphones. No treble mostly bass sound to be honest they sounded muffled. Was very disappointed!....So I heard from customer support and they made it right by me by sending me an upgraded headphone set. So will let you know how they sound when I get them. *********So I got the new E8 cowin headphones and they have way more percussion and treble and acoustics. They came with a carrying bag to store them for travel. Way better sound. I think you will enjoy them.,5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"WOW. I used to have Boise noise cancelling headphones for years and they just recently broke. I couldn't fathom dropping so much money to get new ones so I did some research about noise canceling headphones for a cheaper price and found these. BUY THEM! They are amazing and SO much cheaper than other brands but are just as good in quality. They look super sleek, sit super comfortably when wearing, and the quality of sound, bass, and noise cancellation is AMAZING. They are exactly as pictured and would 105% recommend getting these. So so so worth the price.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
I've always had my own office for work.  Recently I went to work for a new company that placed me in a cubical farm with over 60 people.  Obviously I wanted something that I could wear for long periods of time that allowed me to focus on my work and not my neighbor's.  In addition to listening to music to drown out my cube mates I've use these for conference calls and verbal data entry.  I have done this by connecting via Bluetooth and an audio line.  Either way has worked well.,5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"The headphone sound quality is great with the noise cancellation feature. I mostly listen to audio books and some music, when flying. I'm not an every day user. The only downside I have found is the micro USB charging port has become dislodged. As a result the headphones are not charging effectively after 8 hours being plugged in to charge and multiple attempts to move the USB port around to get the red light to stay on, the battery only reached 90%. I don't know if it's a battery life issue or a material quality issue. The headphone fit nicely and are feel light even after wearing them for several hours. Overall, I feel they are a good value for the price.",4,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
"These are fantastic headphones. Easy connection to your phone. I have used these for over a year now, but I would not recommend for using with phone calls. These are great for everything else though. The microphone that is built into the headset is not effective for talking on the phone. People are always unable to hear me as it is too soft on their end. As soon as I disconnect the headphones, people can hear me just fine. I have spent hours at a time of wearing this headset with my PC and phone. They work great for that, just not phone calls or anything else that requires microphone use.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"I managed to break my E7 with too much of use on business travel, shoving it into tight laptop bags et all.

These headphones are very good. I use them when my wife is sleeping. They bluetooth directly to my tv. Can't really speak to the noise cancelling abilities. Haven't had the opportunity to test that. Sound quality is very good as far as I'm concerned.,5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"Noise canceling is meh, having tried the Bose headphones these are not impressive for noise canceling without music to assist. Sound quality and bass are very good/great.

"I was skeptical because I had never heard of the brand, but I went by customer review star rating. I'm glad I did because these are incredible. Unfortunately, I can't enjoy the wireless aspect of it because my computer doesn't have Bluetooth on it. Other than that though, these are the most comfortable headphones I've had in a long time. HIGHLY suggest!",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0

"Seriously great customer service. I was originally upset when the plastic portion of the E7 headphones broke on me, but I was very happy with the customer service I received after the fact. Including finding out that there is an 18-month product warranty that I didn’t realize they supply. Although I feel like the materials used to make this product could be more comfortable (i.e., the head strap), the sound works well. I have only been able to compare the noise cancellation with the upgraded model (SE7) and of course the upgraded model has better NC. I would recommend the SE7 if you can swing it, but the E7 works well if you’re looking for a less-expensive option. Either way, you will get great service if you need it.",4,1,2019-7-27,1,0,1
Well I think these cordless headphones are great! Superb sound! Although I don't switch it to Noise Cancelling I've been playing music off and on and battery is still almost full charge!

"These are excellent quality blue-tooth, over-the-ear headphones for the money. Sure, they don't quite measure up to premium headphones (which I also have), but at less than 1/4 the price of those, who cares? They are light, comfortable, decent looking, and for most of us, the sound quality is probably good enough to enjoy our favorite music, audio books, streaming videos, or whatever. I think these are a bargain and I intend to use them often.",5,1,2017-7-25,1,0,0
I’ve used many headphones including Bose and these have been the best so far.  The battery life is amazing and lasts at least 12 hours per charge. After my first set were destroyed by a pool I bought two more.  One for my teen and the other from me.,5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
Amazing  sound quality for the price. Battery life is excellent. Noise cancelling is okay. Not as good as 300. Dollar pair of sony. But close enough. And cost lot less. I can by 4 pairs of these and still take the little woman out to eat. And she ain't that little. :p,5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0

"For the price, you can’t go wrong with these. One charge lasts me 2 weeks. The sound quality is clear, and with the noise canceling feature, I don’t get disturbed by all the background noise on the NYC subway or NJ transit.

I bought these headphones primarily for gaming and they are perfect.  I can now play a game while my wife watches TV in the same room with no distractions.  Very comfortable and I rarely have to charge them because of the great battery life.  Great sound and high quality construction.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0

"I bought these to use at work. They sound great and the noise cancelling is amazing. Some review talked about the bass being too much, and I will say that it is a bit much in non noice canceling mode, but with the noice cancelling on, everything seems balanced. These headphones can also be used with an aux cable so you can use them with non bluetooth items. Lastly, the battery live is crazy on these. I use them everyday for 1-3 hours a day and change them about every 2 - 3 weeks.",5,1,2018-7-19,1,0,0

These headphones sound great for the price point! Deep bass that doesn’t distort. The customer service was outstanding too. The first pair I received was defective after the first use. The Bluetooth kept cutting in and out. I contacted customer service and they sent another pair out immediately without even waiting for the return. I love these headphones so much I bought my daughter a pair and will probably gift a couple more pairs to family. They are also extremely comfortable to wear!,5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
It’s nothing special. Noise cancellation is right on par with what you pay for actually the hole entire head set is on par with what you pay for. Except the sound volume I’ve had 20 dollar head phones that get louder. If you like it loud don’t get these.,3,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"These headphones have a satisfying sound and a long lasting battery. It's been very easy to pair with any device I happen to be using at the time, which has included my ASUS ROG laptop, my Samsung Galaxy tablet, and a Google Pixel XL phone. The noise reduction is very easy to discern; I can't even hear myself speak on low volume levels. They're an attractive addition to my music experience. I may have to buy a second pair as my girlfriend keeps threatening to ""borrow"" them.",5,1,2017-7-12,1,0,0

"These fit fully over my ears and block sound well, even without NC turned on. Sound quality for voice is very good, and for music is excellent! The padding on the headband area is very soft, which makes them comfortable to wear for an hour or more during a teleconference meeting. The microphone seems to pick up well, too. No extra noise gets added, and everyone understands me clearly as I speak at a normal volume level.

The sound is decent for the price. Mic quality is poor I'm told from phone calls. Purchased a cable with built in mic and was clear. Main issue is no auto turn off. My kid uses them for remote school work and leaves them on that drains the battery.,3,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0

"This product is a very good product and has a great appearance. It didn't exceed my expectations though because I some how thought that it had a slot for SD cards but it doesn't and it also doesn't have extra volume. Active noise cancellation is ok but could be better because I can still hear the noise of any loud sounding stuff around me when it's on but for this cost I'm guessing this is probably as good as it gets, 🤷 I'm not sure. Battery life is excellently phenomenal; superb. I charged it for the first time on a Friday and it didn't die until Tuesday following. And the comfort of this device on your head is awesome, it covers my whole ears and leave space too so that another plus. The bass on the headphones is alright, not ear deafening or drowning out other parts. And when noise cancellation is on the bass gets less. So this may not be the best product on the market but if you're looking for something $70 or less then this is the best one to get, until something better for the same price comes along of course.",4,1,2017-12-9,1,0,0

"The charge has some super long staying power. Excellent sound quality and bass for the money spent. Not a huge fan of the headband portion....seems it could be  less bulky,  but the padding is comfortable.  Unfortunately it's also slick, so they fall down or back on you at the gym. And create a lot of hair static, which leaves you needing a mirror unless you dig the finger-in-socket look.",5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"I've had the headphones for about a month and used them extensively. The sound seems decent. I have not used other headphones to compare (only earbuds). It seems to me that the highs and lows could probably be more clear, BUT I doubt enough to justify paying 2-3 times what these cost. I'll probably never be in the market for high end head phones, so I expect some concession on sound quality.I'm just as concerned about durability. Hoping these last a few years.",5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
Bought these to help lighten the noise at work. People are talking on the phones and being loud all day. Honestly for the price they are perfect. My ear can get a little toasty.

They are very comfortable for long wearing time and sound as good as any I’ve tried....including the some higher priced models that get all the ratings.

If you have really small ears and head they may work for you. This item hurts my ears to wear them over 15 min. for being so tight on my head. The blue tooth will only connect with one device at a time. I can be on my Laptop and the phone will ring and want connect till you shut your connection down on computer or any other device. I have tried them out for a month went to return them and their web site said no returns. I would not buy this item again.,1,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0

"Great full sound quality with good noise cancellation. It is very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. The battery lasts all day while being used and lasts for weeks while on standby. Only drawback I have is that microphone is either not well placed or very weak. I tried to use it for phone calls and most pepke could barely hear me. I had to stop using it for that so I was rather bummed about that. But for $50, it is still a great deal to me.",4,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"I like them, they work well and link with my iPhone with no issues... knocked off a star because the print on the controls is very very small and I have to get magnifying glass to read them.  Sound is good, and it almost totally masks the neighbor's yard crew ""apocalypse now"" noise!",4,1,2018-4-1,1,1,0
"The clarity of sound is great, the bass is great, I’m not sure what I was expecting with the noise canceling effect, but it blocked more than a regular headset. They feel pretty good on my head and the material they are made of seems like they may go the distance.  The 18 month warranty is nice to have in my pocket in case something fails.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"For the price, these are pretty good. As others have stated, they do feel cheap and there's a pretty bad lag. They aren't really noise canceling either, I can't hear my  refrigerator compressor or the PS4 fan; that's about the extent of it's talents. But as far as sound quality, they sound fairly decent and have a decent amount of bass.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

The ear mugs are soft & comfortable. The music deliverance is smooth & clear. However as far as the blue tooth usage is concern it too isolated for driving in the car. It noise reduction is great but you need to hear other things in traffic. Same problem for around the house especially if you have small kids. Other than that it is a excellent product & it requires commonsense as to when& where you can use it.,5,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
March/2018: I had a minor problem with a part of my headphone and the service customer was FANTASTIC! They give you 18 months warranty and they are there for you in case something happens!

"Best customer service: accidentally broke these and they sent me another new pair free of charge.Amazing quality: very good quality, nice materials used and high sound quality",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
"The NC feature is amazing. It's just me and the music as I turn it on. At first the noise cancelling feature was a bit much for my ears, in that the pressure/vacuum created in my ears was uncomfortable. But after a few wears, my ears are used to it. A downside to the NC is that the bass quality suffers a bit. For me as a musician, it's noticeable enough to mention, but not terrible. I can switch the headphones to BT (bluetooth i think) if it bothers me enough, at which the bass quality increases.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
Can't say enough about these. Was worried the twisted cup design would fail over time. Even if it does I would buy another pair. Incredible in every way. One of the best ANC systems I've used. One of the lightest and most comfortable that fits exceptionally over my ears. Can wear them for 8 hours (with a few 5-30 breaks) with little to no discomfort.,5,1,2017-7-18,1,1,0
"This is nice product for its performance - high five. However, very poor reliability This is my second pair of headphones: the first one had to be exchanged right away since it could not connect via Bluetooth. This one worked for 16 months, and now one of the mounting swivel connectors is broken (see the photo). I guess, $60 for 16 months is not too bad, $3.75 a month, but it would be nice to get a disclaimer: bad reliability, spend extra five bucks to keep it going for 2-3 year... Still, I guess I’m going to get another pair - we’ll see what happens",3,1,2020-1-26,1,0,1
"These headphones have excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. My headphones' right ear cuff got loose and started hanging around 6 months after buying.

"I would have given 5 starts but why have a carrying bag that isn't big enough.  Come on, just an inch bigger would make a world of difference. Carrying them is cumbersome (well mores so than ear buds) and having a bag they keep slipping out of is rediculous.",4,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0

"These are amazingly quiet for the price-point.  Very fine fit and finish.  20-20000K is all a human ear can hear, so these fill the bill nicely. I do wish the triangular function key was a little more intuitive.  UP lowers the Volume.  DOWN raises it. But I'm getting used to it.  I get good reports of sound quality from the mic.",5,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0

Worst headphones I have ever had the pleasure of using. The Connection for Bluetooth is horrible no matter how close or far away there is constant static. They don't noise cancel anything. The sound quality is that of a 10 dollar Walmart set. Would not recommend or purchase anything from this manufacturer.,1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"They’re amazing! Very attractive, well-designed, and the sound quality is great!  Good battery life. They’re also quite comfortable; nice padding around the ears, and each side can be adjusted to exactly where you want it.

"Bought these for my frequent air travel - great battery life, sound quality is solid, noticed a marked difference in my phone volume with the noise cancellation while mid flight, also not tight on my head - I’m very happy with these.

Would definitely buy again!Only negative is size, but that comes with over ear headphones.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
My son uses these in class to help lower the volume of classroom noises.  They are very comfortable to wear for extended amounts of time.  They sound quality is wonderfully when he does want to listen to sounds he chooses.  The noise cancelling is just right.These are really quality headphones.,5,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
For the price these are very good headphones. I only use them for long distance plane flights. They are very comfortable but do feel a bit heavy on the ears after several hours of use.

"I purchased these in 09/2017. They are my daily driver for my multiple trips to the gym each day. The audio quality is excellent, comfortable fit, easy Bluetooth, and long battery. Today the right ear fell apart, I likely used them for well over 700 total hours and was sad. I emailed customer support and 8 hours later received a code that allowed me to get a brand new pair (18 month warranty). Beyond impressed, I was expecting to have to buy another pair and in 2 days I’ll have new ones.",5,1,2018-3-6,1,0,0
I bought these headphones to block out the noise from my distance learning 3rd grader. They are awesome. I play a little music and I can't hear the child screaming at his friend on the PS4. I can work in peace. They fit very comfortably and have great sound quality. The headphones have awesome battery and I did not have to charge them as much as I thought. I highly recommend.,5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"These headphones allow me to get work done in an open office setting. There's just one thing I'd change, if I move my head to the beat of my music, there's a slight distortion. Other than that, I love the comfort, audio and functionality of these headphones.UPDATE Don't bother, to they've already crapped out and sound terrible. The speakers have a lot of reverb and have officially blown. Save up your pennies and get something better.",4,1,2018-4-27,1,0,0
Great product and a great price. The noise cancellation is excellent for my concept 2 tower while I work out and watch Netflix movies.  I could hear subtle audio and it made a big difference in the movie experience on my iPad .  Also the Bluetooth connects effortlessly and quickly recognizes the device when “restarting” another day.,5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"I originally bought these headphones in May before a trip overseas, and I will admit they sound and feel OK.  My only issue is that now, just over 6 months later, they have broken.  Not due to wear and tear.  Just normal use.  The plastic swivel that allows you to turn each earphone inward to put them in their case snapped, leaving the right earphone dangling by a wire.  Of course, Amazon nor Cowin won't replace them, even though it was clearly due to a cheaply made product.  So I'm out $80+ (it wasn't on-sale when I bought them).Worth it for a good price, but keep them in their case.",3,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"Not true noise cancelling, but close. Probably blocks out about 80-85% of outside noise. Ergonomic design is great! Light weight and the ear pieces are comfortable for HOURS of wear!

I purchased these bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and was very skeptical about the brand and price. I ended up liking these because of the sound quality and ear comfort. These cushion your ears very well and keep the outside noise isolated. I will be using these for reviewing audio evidence with my Paranormal Investigation team. I will update my review if anything changes from my experience.,5,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0

"While at work, someone else connected to my headphones via bluetooth (I assume they don't realize it). I don't know who and can't stop the connection. I have to leave the building and connect my phone then I can return to work and use headphones. If my phone gets disconnected somehow, the other connection automatically reconnects and I have to repeat the process. Product is bulletproof other than this issue that I'm unsure how they could resolve unless a push button were added to limit external connections.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"Amazing different with noise canceling on airplane. It's a great improvement from the old sharper image gadget I had before. At this price, really hard to find anything bad to say. And it perform just as well as the much more expensive brand. I love it.",5,1,2019-6-12,1,1,0
"UPDATE: The seller is replacing the item at no cost to me! I am happy with the customer service and the product!I bought this item after doing reviews on various headphones. I liked how they felt and the sound quality, but unless I had white noise playing I could still hear quite a lot of external noise and talking. However, my biggest complaint is that one of the earphones broke just a few months after I bought them and only after using them several times. Now it just swivels freely and dangles by one wire. I've had to rig it using Gorilla Tape. I wrote to the seller but got no reply. I would not buy these again.",4,1,2018-10-27,1,0,0
"Sound very good, well built. Bluetooth work perfect, batery life excelent. Only one thing, and may be the problem are my ear, is after 30 munutes of use star hurting my ear.

I gave it a try and was the best decision. These are my work out headphones. They work really well. The sound is really good. It almost sound the same way like the $ 1000 headphones I was going to buy. Another thing, I was worried if they were going to be too heavy but not, they are very light and after a week you get used to it and do not feel it anymore. Overall, I am very happy with the price and the quality. I will recommend them in a bit.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0

Easy to install.  Easy to use.  The best and easiest headset ever made.  It works with almost any t.v. except not if you have XFinity.XFinity actually only uses Sony headsets (overpriced) not easy to use or install.  I paid more for it and I am sorry we switched from,5,1,2018-3-25,1,0,0

"My needs for these headphones were to use them for listening to music and for participating in phone meetings. After receiving them, I was impressed by the workmanship of these headphones, liked the bass response but thought the mid-range and high end were too muddy. Of greater concern was that my voice was not being picked up by the microphone. I contacted Cowin customer support and their response was courteous and immediate! They replaced the headphones and I received them within two days of contact. The new headphones were an improvement in sound quality and voice reproduction. I would rate these headphones as great value in their price range and think their customer support was outstanding. Five stars overall!",5,1,2018-1-4,1,0,0
"They help remove background noise and play audio. So, if you are on a plane or a train and don't want to hear the children that don't want to be there with you, these will help. You can use them with Bluetooth or wired, they have good battery life and recharge quickly. Enjoy.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"They do exactly what I need them to do: play sound both wirelessly and while tethered.  Charge time appears to be quick relative to battery life.  Noise cancelling is good, usually cancelling smaller and repeating external sounds.  The foam around the ears is very comfortable and makes for a nice fit around the ears.  The microphone is very good.Cons: battery is used even when being used tethered (this might not be a big deal for some, but is very annoying for me).  Occassionally, there is a buzzing sound that occurs when the noise cancelling is active (this usually goes away if you turn off the noise cancelling for a while).",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"Not really worth it to me. Not good if you're sensitive to outside noises, I could still hear things while wearing them. Music quality was good. They're nice if your not looking for complete noise cancellation.",2,1,2020-4-17,1,2,0

The NFC connection with my phone was a snap, they sound good, and I can wear them at work nearly 40 hours a week without them becoming uncomfortable and with minimal charging.There is one thing I would have changed, however, if I were to have designed them; the controls are backwards. It's not a huge deal and after going backwards when you meant to go forward a couple times you will remember, but the bottom button is next/volume up and the top button is previous/volume down. It's a little counter-intuitive, but nothing you can't get used to.",5,1,2017-8-30,1,0,0

I use them mostly to listen to podcasts or music while mowing the lawn and have absolutely no problem hearing everything and in good quality sound to boot!

I love the bluetooth controls and the noise cancelling feature. It's the next level of immersive audio experiences.UPDATE: It's coming up on 2 years that I've been using these headphones, the battery life is still going well and I've convinced one more person to buy them for our office. I'm so glad I got these they have been a great way to stay on task!",5,1,2017-1-26,1,0,0
"The sound is good, active noise cancelling is good (never used it before so was very surprised at how it works). My first bluetooth headset so only regret is how long it takes to switch between devices but that's probably true for other headsets as well. Used to using ~$20 headsets, but this will probably save me money since I go through headphones in ~3 months when the cord inevitably wears out.",5,1,2016-6-6,1,5,0
"Really impressed with these headphones, and for the price they’re almost perfect. I’m still giving them five stars because they’re so good, but the volume up button is below the volume down button. Counter-intuitive, but minor considering the value for the price. I love these headphones.",5,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0
"These headphones are overpriced, have horrible sound quality, and never worked properly.  The battery goes dead immediately.  Very disappointed in this purchase.  I bought the case that goes with them and so am out almost 70$ for something that never worked.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"These are the first headphones I've ever had so I have nothing to compare them to.  I absolutely love them!  I ordered for the plane.  The quality is excellent and I love how far I can get away from my device via Bluetooth.  I got the white ones and would definitely recommend them.  They came packaged so nicely, too, and even have carry bag.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,1
Pros:- Super comfortable,5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,1
"Comfortable headphones that work either over Bluetooth or with the headphone jack. Recently wore them on a cross country flight and they worked great. Deducted one star because I'm not sure the noise cancelling feature actually does anything... it seemed to me that simply putting the headphones on blocked a lot of the airplane noise, and the sound didn't change when I activated the noise cancellation. Either way, these are definitely much better than in-ear headphones for flights.",4,1,2017-7-21,1,0,0
"I was very disappointed with this $60 headset for online classes. The mic quality is terrible- everyone says the voice sounds muffled. The headset is fine, just the mic sux.  I've had much better luck with my half the price Logitech headset.",1,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"These are great headphones.  I use them to watch TV and also to listen to book and music on my Kindle HD.  When I have my TV time it is nice to not hear all the house noises or the dogs barking at the other end of the house.  Makes my TV time much more relaxing and pleasurable.  They are so comfortable when listening to music or a book on my kindle I have fallen asleep and worn them all night, on occasion, without any problems.",5,1,2018-9-3,1,0,0
Compared to my studio bear wireless headphones they are good quality but I’m still a bit lost with the noise canceling feature,5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"I am sure that the $200 and up noise cancelling headphones may be better, however for the price, I am extremely happy.  When traveling on an airplane, these headphones cut down on the background engine noise, but still allow me to hear the announcements and be able to talk to the people around me.  This is exactly what I was looking for!",5,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
I received my headphones earlier this week. First of all the packaging they came in was high quality and very impressive. The sound is great and the noise cancelling works well. I can't wait to take them on the airplane! The next day I received an email from the company letting me know if I needed anything to just reach out. I would definitely purchase from them again!,5,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
I use for Bluetooth phone calls because of background noise. I have a hard time understanding speech but music sounds ok.My star rating is for how they work for me but a music lover may have a better experience. They have good bass.,3,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"These are the 2nd pair we have purchased for my husband. The dogs really seem to love eating them so you can add ""tasty"" to the list. I think they aren't super loud, but then again, you really aren't supposed to listen to super loud music. The hubs love them though and they hook up to the the bluetooth really easily.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
This was purchased mainly for airplane travel and it does a good job with noise cancellation.  The sound quality of music is also good. The charge seemed to last for quite awhile too - at least 8 hours.  The only minor con is that the fit of the headphones is a bit more snug than desired.  This is altogether a great product for the price!,5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"I gave these to my son, as a birthday gift, and he loves them. According to him, the active noise cancelling works better than he imagined possible. The down side is now I don't know if he can't hear me for real, or he's just ignoring my request to do a chore. All jokes aside, they really do sound like a more expensive set of head phones, and they have a good warranty.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"These really are a great set of headphones for the price. The presentation is quite nice, comes in a faux leather bag with an auxillary cord in case you want wired headphones. The connectivity is quick and secure, with rich full sound from both video and music.",5,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"I was initially skeptical about buying these headphones, but my feelings soon changed after I started using them!! I'm pretty amazed by the battery life, although I don't think they live up to their 30-hour claim, however, the battery life is up there! The sound quality is a little bit above average, however, the bass is turned up, and more noticeable when the noise canceling was on. Now that I think about it, the sound quality -in my opinion- is better with it. Granted, these don't compare to the headphones from Bose, however, for the money, they are pretty good!I recommend these if you're in the market for some noise-canceling headphones.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"Love the look and feel. Does decrease the sound of vibration on planes and trains, but it does not cancel out voices.  Overall, a very good  product for travel, but pay more if you want true noise cancellation.",5,1,2018-9-12,1,1,0
"these headphones are by far the best for me. I have had other headphones, many were too big and wouldn't stay on my head, meaning the sounds wouldn't flow correctly. these E7's are completely opposite! My E7's are so comfortable, stay on my head, cup my ears just right! I work at home. I bought these to cancel some of the unnecessary noise from my children, and outside, so I am able to focus on the task at hand. I am all about that BASS, these headphones are my favorite! I will absolutely buy from Cowin again!",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
I can’t say enough about these headphones! The sound quality is outstanding! I use the noise cancellation feature primarily when I’m meditating and it’s made my experiences even better. I’m able to relax to a deeper state than without them. Would absolutely recommend these to everyone!,5,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0
"They work great as I use them at the gym. They are a little big for that purpose, can make my ears sweat a bit. I wish they could get louder but for the money I expect it is a great value. Battery life is fantastic but Bluetooth range is less than stellar.",4,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
This product for a headset and sound control is 5 * I just hope that people don't have problems with it. The customer service phone number that they give you goes directly 2 automation and says we are currently closed regular business hours are 9 till but when you call you get no answer. Customer service if you have a problem would be terrible. Otherwise they would get five stars easily. Also did not know you had to order the USB dolber separately.,2,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"I'm generally skeptical on unknown named products that have this many reviews but these are truly great over-the-ear headphones.  They have a soft, snug fit with great vocal sound but also great bass.  I'm very pleased with these Cowin E7 headphones and would recommend to anyone needing a relatively cheap pair with high quality sound.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Bluetooth connectivity worked on all devices I tried including a laptop, tablet, phone & TV. No issues. Works great. Sound quality is very good. The wired headphone connection also provides very good sound. Noted that when ANC is turned on, it somewhat reduces the bass response when listening to music. The only complaint I would have is that the voice quality from the microphone was somewhat “muffled” when making Skype or cell phone calls. Otherwise, highly recommended.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0
I absolutely love them! It is easy to use and very comfortable on my ears. Noise cancelling works really well. The only gripe I have about the headphone is the volume button. I feel the long press for the volume should be short press and to skip a song should be long press. Other than that I love them.,4,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0
"I didn't get to spend much time with these as I figured out one feature that didn't work the way I want at all. In order for the audio cable connection to work, bluetooth needs to be on. This didn't make sense to me at all. If I'm using an audio cable, it's because either my battery would be dead, or I'm conserving battery for longer listening time, ie: 8hrs listening from laptop at work via cable connection, so that I have battery for bluetooth afterwards at the gym. This was a dissapointment. I also was not a fan of the button configuration. In addition, the bluetooth slider is the same slider for noise cancelling, you push it one click further for NC. I didn't like this and wished they were separate buttons. The mic was just okay upon testing.",3,1,2018-2-15,1,0,0
"Amazing quality headphones. Does an excellent job cancelling noise, I tested it by wearing them while doing the dishes and while listening to music I couldn't even hear the water running full blast. They feel very comfortable to wear and the ears fold down for easy storage. It's a great noise cancelling headphone without spending a whole lot",5,1,2017-7-16,1,1,0
"E7 arrived quickly and worked perfectly for a few days before a buzzing noise began. Great customer service. Lawrence recommended a different model SE7. Arrived super quickly and are wonderful. Soft, lightweight and no buzzing. Hope they last longer.",4,1,2019-8-2,1,1,0
"Bought these for my 8 yr old son while he plays his iPad. Connection is a cinch, battery is crazy good and these REALLY cancel out noise for him, so much that from 4 feet away, I have to really yell a couple of times to get his attention!",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"Alright these are the best head phones if you're on a budget or just cheap 😂 and don't want to spend a ton of money, plus you don't lose out on much. The sounds great and I would say that these could be compared to some more expensive brands; not all but some which is still good for what you're paying. 👍",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"These cans are great, until they break. I've owned 2 pairs now and they both lasted right at a year of moderate use before they broke where the headband meets the speaker. Same weak spot with both pairs. I cant justify replacing again and will be trying alternatives.",3,1,2020-7-6,1,1,0
"Sound quality is great. I use it primarily for listening to the tv at night and can only compare the sound to being in a movie theater. So very easy to sync with any Bluetooth transmitter. I would definitely recommend them. I only gave it four stars because the noise cancelling feature isn't as good as I had hoped. But for the price, it's stI'll pretty good.",4,1,2018-2-18,1,1,0
"Got these for general outdoor work around the house. For the most part they do a great job. Battery life is excellent and they are lightweight, comfortable and easy to use. Probably my biggest complaint is that they don’t stand up to the hype of the Amazon reviews. They surely aren’t that loud and the bass is nowhere near as good as what’s written about them. For the price they’re great and I’m getting good use of them.",4,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"Very pleased with the quality. I really like that the noise canceling feature is part of the switch that turn the headphones on. Many times I have had dead batteries because I have left the ANC feature on, on other brands of headphones.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"Good sound quality.  But they are poorly made.I am very gentle with my electronics... the swivel connecting the head band to the ear cups is poorly made.  I am within the 1 year warranty.  UPDATE ***  I contacted COWIN Support, they have replaced my broken headset.  Their customer service took a few days to contact me, but in the end, they came through.  I am a happy camper.",4,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0
"I am very pleased with this product. It came in quality packaging, was extremely comfortable to wear, and the sound quality was excellent for such an affordable price. Noise blocking is adequate. If the volume is too loud, people within a five foot distance will definitely be able to hear it from my headphones, but overall I am extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
Even at the maximum volume it’s not very loud.  Sound quality is poor and there is no bass.  The best part of the headphones is the padding is comfortable on the ears.,2,1,2020-7-28,1,1,1
"These do block quite a bit more noise than regular headphones, I don’t need to blast my sound to drown out chatting people at the gym!Ear pieces are comfortable and so far, the headset doesn’t slip off while doing exercises lying down or bent over.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"Great for:I used the headphones for tv because my neighbors, which live above are a bit noisy. My pictures actually move outward every time they have fun in bed that’s directly on the floor. Lol I’d rather hear my movie. Lol Also great for when they blare their music. I can actually hear my own.",5,1,2018-8-6,1,0,0
Bought these when I was home recovering from a total knee replacement. My hubby loves judge shows and I needed a way to block the tv sound. These worked great and I was able to watch movies on my iPad or listen to music while he watched his shows. Looking forward to taking them on the plane in June when I fly cross country. The charge seems to last a really long time and it charges fast. The sound is excellent. So far really happy with these!,5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"Similar in quality to the new Pioneer SE-M57BT-S or UBL E55BT, it's well constructed, metal headband and all. The NC is focused on a specific range of sound (frequencies) but even the earcup's passive NC is decent so there isn't much leak.We have these 30 inch fans at work and that noise gets blocked out even at minimum volume.",4,1,2018-3-17,1,0,0
"I wear these headphones nearly sixteen hours per day, almost every day of the week, without fail.  As you can see, the padding was a bit worn away after nearly eleven months of said usage.  As they are not user-replaceable, Cowin replaced the entire headphone set, with a brand new set (by way of an Amazon code; I placed the new order using the code), without a moment's hesitation or effort on my part.  Can't beat that service; looking forward to another year with the new set (and will upgrade to E8, at that time).",5,1,2018-12-1,1,0,1
I cannot pair or use this if the connector cords are for the old iPhones. The XR has a different audio input than the cords that are included. I tried to find a cord that would work but there’s none to be found.,2,1,2019-6-8,1,2,0
"Works great and sound great too. Charges really fast and batteries last a long time, tried 3 days of 7 hour playing an online gave with Team Speak and the phones worked great and last the 21 hours just fine. Easy to set up on Windows 10.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
I use these while I mow lawns and use my bobcat. Great noise cancelling and delivers really good sound. Which they were a bit louder but that's only due to the amount of hearing loss that I have already sustained at age 53. Good product.,5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
I was skeptical but the noise cancelling feature on these works really well! We got 2 pairs for our kids to start school at home and they never been comfortable enough to wear all day and they can take class and talk to their teachers without distracting each other even though they are in the same room! Great product!,5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0
"I was enjoying these headphones until I realized that other people can hear what I'm listening to. I like to crank the volume up, okay? It's also ""necessary"" when I'm on the subway. Here I was, thinking I was listening to my trap music playlist privately...You're safe to party on your own playing music at about 75% of the max volume, anything above that will be sharing your music with anyone within a 10 ft radius.",2,1,2019-9-10,1,1,0
I had to purchase these for work since Teleworking where I am constantly taking calls on the computer. These allow me to hear conversations clearly and the microphone works excellent. I haven't had someone tell me that they had trouble hearing me yet.They are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and can adjust very easily. Highly recommended!,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I have these headphones, and my son needed a set because he broke off his wired headphones in his iPad. He, and I, don't need a fancy pair of headphones, so when I saw these come up on sale again, I jumped on them. After using these for several months, I don't understand why someone spends $200 or more for Bluetooth noise canceling headphones when a perfectly capable pair are available here. The battery life is good. The sound is good (you don't need high priced headphones for digital music - that's a scam). And the price and quality is excellent.",5,1,2017-12-10,1,0,0

"These headphones are incredible, and the price makes them even better! They have incredible battery life. I can leave them on for 3 or 4 days straight before they die. They have great noise cancellation, not quite as good as Bose, but still very good. For reference, I've owned 2 pairs of Beats and I much prefer these. They're bigger than my Beats were, but they are incredibly comfortable, and the Bluetooth range is superior! You really won't regret buying these, I promise.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"Amazing product. At the price point I was not expecting much but I was truly surprised. They knock out all noise, the clarity is perfect, no problems connecting Bluetooth to my phone (had several issues with other brands). The design is actually useful too. The controls on the side work well. I typically can’t stand having anything over my ears but the pads are so comfortable you almost forget you’re wearing it (until someone tries to speak to you and you can’t hear them because of the noise canceling effects)Wouldn’t hesitate to purchase other products from this retailer.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"Very good quality. Noise cancelling works great, battery lasts a great amount of time, charges relatively fast. Doesn't look cheap and it works actually much better than a BOSE I have.One funny thing that should be enough of a reason to ask for a replacement is that mine came with TWO LEFT EAR labels. So basically I don't know what is left and what is right because both have L written on.",4,1,2017-3-31,1,0,0
"I had problems with the first pair, seller sent me out another set and they were much better. The highs and mids are very clear and they have a nice pouch to store them in. I can't find headphones that are as loud as I want anywhere but I like my music loud. These are good for people who like to keep it mellow.",3,1,2018-11-27,1,0,0
"Sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort = a great purchase.  I’ve spent $20 to $200 on headphones and these are as good as any of them, but the Bluetooth makes these better for moving around and leaving your phone in your pocket.

"I really enjoyed these headphones, they were comfortable sound was great for the price, the only issue I've had is the headphones have broken on the ear part after about a year after purchase. J had hoped they would last longer for the price",3,1,2019-4-12,1,1,0
Great sound for the price. So far my dad loves them. Bluetooth so he can do yard work and mow the grass with no obstructions or things to get caught on. Seems silly to pay a lot more for something like this unless you are going to protect them in a velvet lined box,5,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

"I have had two sets of this headphone.  Both had really good sound, but fell apart in about a year's time.  The present set  just came apart where the earpiece fits into the headband.  There is a very small plastic piece that the cording runs through that screws into the headband and that breaks very easily.  Once that happens there is no way to fix.  Real bummer when they could have used metal pieces and had no problems.",2,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
The bass is not that deep it actually is slightly distorted when you use the noise cancelling feature. With the noise canceling feature turned off the bass is extremely weak!

"The sound quality is excellent in my opinion.  The Bluetooth connectivity is very helpful.  The headphones are quite adjustable and I find them very comfortable to wear, even when sleeping.  The noise cancellation feature works AMAZINGLY well.  We live on a rather busy, noisy street.  Wearing these headphones at night, with the noise cancellation feature activated, attenuates the ambient noise in our bedroom quite nicely, and I sleep better at night as a result.",5,1,2017-8-17,1,0,0
"These headphones are quite simply, AMAZING! I work in a very noisy production facility, and I am able to both hear my music quite clearly, as well as hear what is going on around me.

"I am updating my previous 4-star review.  The sound quality was great and they were very comfortable.  But they suddenly stopped working after 3 1/2 months.  It's probably the battery, which of course cannot be replaced, because there are no beeps or lights at all when trying to use or recharge the headphones.  I have had the same problem with the last 3 headphones (various brands) I bought but in those cases the batteries died in 6-12 months.  Some company needs to figure out how to make headphones that last more than a year.",1,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
these sound pretty good for the price. i would buy them again. I had my son try his Bose and these blindfolded and he could tell the difference..........but ONLY because he wears the Bose all the time. For the price he was blown away.,4,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"These are great for the price. I bought them for my wife just to listen to audio books or music if she's walking. She doesn't like the small, in-ear headphones. She says these are. soft and comfortable to wear. The noise cancelling works just fine and the sound is clear. She doesn't use headphones enough to justify the cost of Bose headphomes, so these are perfect. Considering getting a pair for myself.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"When I received my first set of these headphones, the sound quality was great, but the output from the mic wasn't great. People that I was talking with compared the recording quality to talking on a very bad phone call that was cutting in and out. I contacted COWIN about the issue, but they didn't initially respond. I then registered the headphones and got an email from them asking me to leave a review and I mentioned the problem I was having and they replaced it quickly!I'm happy to say that this second pair of headphones I have is working much better and what I'm saying over the mic can now actually be heard.",5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
I wasn't impressed with these headphones at all. The sound quality was ok but nothing better than my ear buds. The noise cancellation was only decent in my opinion.

"I liked the the fact that the headphones functioned as advertised and paired via bluetooth to my computer quickly. in addition, the headphones connect to it each time almost instantly.I did not like the ear cushions fit around my ears. The material is nice and soft, but the size of the center hole is a little bit too small. Although my ear size is average the perimeter of the center hole, which is hard material, rests on part of my ears instead of going completely around them. As a result, after prolonged use they hurt my ears and I have to keep moving them around to slightly new positions.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"When I first tried them I knew, immediately, they were the ONES. Perfect fit...covering the entire ear without pinching. Sound quality is superb...sound and mic. I've been using other brand-name headsets. These Cowin E7's beat out everything I've tried for the past 4 years or longer.  As an electrical/digital engineer who's used headphones since 1959, I can say the construction quality is excellent. Obviously, I'm very pleased. Likely will acquire a second set real soon.",5,1,2018-12-6,1,1,0
"Excelent headphones. It cannot get better for the price. They do tend to aim for lower frequencies, so they have a really punchy bass, the mids are good, not bad at all for the price but these lack on really defined highs. I have used this wired and wireless, with an LG V20 and can comfortably say that the convenience of being able to use them wired after the battery runs out is great. And about that battery? Yeah, it doesn't run out pretty often, even with the ANC on, which is also pretty good for the price. Again, not the best headphones out there, but definitely make a great argument for a competitive price point. The build quality is solid, not super luxurious but also not cheap feeling. Really comfortable around the ear feeling, it is a great pair of headphones for the price. Can't ask for more, really",5,1,2017-7-17,1,0,0
"I use these while I work from home to help mute the noises of kids, dog & husband. They don't entirely cancel all outside noise but help to mute everything nicely. Sounds quality is good, they are comfortable, and hold charge for several days. Very impressed so far!",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I was contacted by the maker of this company and replaced a defective pair of headphones with a upgraded set of headphones at no charge to me.

Thank you very much Hailie!",5,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"After reading all the great reviews, I was so excited to get these. However, I was disappointed for two reasons. The two main reasons I purchased these were for the NC and the color. In the picture it looks like a beautiful bright kelly green, and the description even says green. The color however is actually teal - not an ugly color, just not what I expected. Secondly, the noise cancellation is non-existent. The regular headphone mode is actually better at reducing ambient noise because of the base quality - the base is noticeably less prevalent in NC mode.",3,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I bought this particular set because of a write up here by a person that bought a set for his kid. He owned a set of bose but took his sons on a trip and was really impressed.  If ypu can impress a bose owner they had to be good.  Well they are good. Nice looking and work really well.  Noise cancelling work good and the music is clear on both cable and bluetooth.  Use to own some pioneers years ago so nothing recent to compare to.  I have BIG ears, lol, and they dont completly cover my ear, disappointing, but for $50 I am extremely pleased and they are almost over my big ears! Lol",4,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0

"Heavy head phones but good quality, sound is good too. Round ear cups doesn't fit all ears but comfortable for small heads.

"I bought these specifically for my flight to Asia, a 12 hour flight each way. They worked very well for it, the airplane noise was almost non existent.Wearing them the entire flight both trips was also not a problem, they were so comfortable I barely noticed they were there.",5,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0
"So far so good! I travel 3 out of every 4 weeks for work (sales) and these have been a lifesaver. In fact the noise cancelling work so well that when I get off the flight, I no longer have that ringing after effect for 2 days, my hearing is normal. Similarly the sound quality of the headphones has been excellent and the controls are intuitive and easy to use. Charging is a breeze and a charge lasts over a full day for me.

"These headphones are a great deal for their price. I've had them for 6 months now with no major issues. The sound quality is great in them and it's impossible to hear anything going on around you when music or a show is playing in these, which is why I wanted them. The battery life is around 1 to 3 days depending on use. My only complaint is that once the battery gets low it makes this beep noise that stops whatever you are listening too. It continues to do this about once every five seconds for the next 30 minutes or so until it dies. Basically it forces you to charge them at the first sign of a low battery instead of an occasional warning noise.",4,1,2018-2-28,1,1,0
Love that it’s Bluetooth! The battery lasts for quite a while too! I use it to sleep and listen to ocean waves and it hasn’t broken yet! Not as good as my last pair at noise canceling but still pretty nice at dimming the white noise and people’s voices,5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
I got these headphones for my wife. She uses her laptop for studying and listens to many video's. She was using a pair of ear buds but they hurt her ears. these headphones solved the problem.

"Awesome sauce, I love these. Used to mow the lawn with earbuds and husq muffs, it stank. These were a perfect replacement for them. I mow with a 27hp 54"" deck Cub Cadet mower and have no problem hearing my music now. One thing to mention though. These offer a direct line in option, which given a noiseless environment, actually sounds and works better, only problem is the noise canceling function turns off when your not using Bluetooth to connect to them. Overall a great buy, and super comfy to wear.",5,1,2017-7-3,1,0,0
This is the second pair I have bought. The first was for my oldest son and they disappeared when he took them to school. These I bought for myself. Especially at the price point these are great headphones. Noise cancelling is very good although the noise cancelling setting reduces music quality somewhat. Otherwise they are great. I cannot see paying 300 dollars for a set.,5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"I bought two of these for when we fly for many hours at a time. The active noise canceling does a good job of dampening the jet noise.

The manufacture saw my review and sent me a new pair of headphones free of charge. The new pair was an updated model of my original pair. They were EXTREMELY difficult to connect to the blue tooth but other than that they seemed fine. Unfortunately, after a few months, the right earpiece stopped working on the new pair. By the end of the week, the headphones did not work at all.I think these headphones are cheaply made.",1,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0

I hate to be startled :-)  I gave it to my adult daughter and she LOVES it.  Of course, she can't hear me calling or talking to her.  Maybe that is why she loves it ;-).  It has worked for over a year.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0

Very nice price point, great value.",5,1,2018-9-18,1,0,0
"I purely use these for white noise/drowning out sounds at Starbucks when I’m trying to study. Noise cancellation is okay... but these aren’t Bose headphones and I’m just a broke student!

"These are my first pair of noise canceling headphones and I love them. The sound quality is great so far. As for noise cancelling, I can still hear slight muffled sounds in the background, but once music is playing, it drowns any background noise right out. They are light, don't feel too bulky. Battery life is long. And seem really high quality for a reasonable price. I'm quite happy with them! The bluetooth isn't connecting to my Macbook for some reason, but that could be on my end. It has connected to my iPhone just fine. I definitely recommend!",5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones and when they arrived i noticed a static or crackling sound when pressing the volume, changing songs etc. pretty much any movement at all. So i returned them and ordered another pair they did the same thing. This being said, they are great headphones and do exactly what the description says. I highly recommend them for casual listening, the noise canceling is perfect. However, the reason i purchased these headphones was for gym purposes and let me tell you they are not recommended for that particular activity!  They crackle and move a lot but other than that they are great headphones for the price. Enjoy guys",4,1,2018-1-14,1,1,0
"I wanted Headphones that would compare to Beats or Bose but was economical.  I found them and haven't stopped using them for personal and work.  The sound and noise cancelling are right there, in my opinion, to that of Beats and Bose both owned by my kids.

"For an affordable price, I didn't expect too much. Package presentation was beautiful. Good deep bass - tested it with Metallica's Pulling Teeth (song is one big bass solo). As a musician, I'm always critical of headphones when it comes to orchestra pieces. These headphones pick up the quietest woodwind to the loudest brass. Only negative is that they are just a tad tight, but I do have a big head. Haha. 5/5 worth a shot for the affordable price",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0

I practiced using the headphones at home and then this week had them on the plane with me. I had downloaded a movie from Amazon Video before leaving home and sat back an watched it with the blue tooth headphones. I don't have anything else to compare it to but i was happy with the results. A trip that passed quickly, and I almost missed my in-flight snack.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"These headphones are a great ""bang for your buck""  I really enjoy them.  I used them daily during my grueling commute to work.  The Noise cancellation is excellent and they sound pretty good.One thing I have to complain about is that the build quality is not the greatest. Like I said earlier, they did not last me one year.  The swiveling mechanism of the headphones broke down after wear and tear.  That is clearly a design flaw as read other people had the same issue.  Luckily the headphones were still under warranty, and Cowin support was able to replace them.",5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"Comfortable, look decent given the cheap plastic, and sound quality is (to my untrained ear) very good.Active noise cancellation is pretty weak, it will filter out gentle mumbles in the background, but no better than earplugs. Don't expect a noisy office to become dead silent with these, you get what you pay for. I can still tell when people are talking across the room, but they sound muted, and higher pitched noises (like a compressor running) cut right through.",4,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
"I have issues concentrating if there's too much background noise, so sometimes I don't even need to play something to use these headphones. Just by turning on the noise cancel I can listen to a speaker or a presentation much more clearly, because it takes away murmur and AC noise completely. But just as it means I can listen to someone clearly, it means it won't block loud sounds like people's conversations. With that, you're going to have to crank up the music and try to ignore it. For the price, though, these were the best thing I could've bought. Not to mention super comfy and they last me FOREVER. I think I charge them once a week or something, really.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I'd like to start off with something you should know first. When I first opened the package for the two sets of headphones I got, they both smelled HEAVILY of paint. (The Blue one was way stronger than the Green one) Just a warning, and it does go away.However, these function fantastic! Great sound and never lost connection for me even walking around my apartment with my device stationary. It even comes with a decent carrying bag. They also look pretty snazzy. They seem a tad bit flimsy but so far no problems.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0

I bought these headphones because they was wireless and i when i plugged them in everything seemed fine. The sound quality for videos wasn't that great at all but it didn't bother me that much. My biggest problem is when I decided to talk to friends using this mic they started screaming and laughing telling me to turn the mic off. I did a mic test to see how it sounded and it was one of the worst things I've heard. It's almost like the sound quality of the mic was supposed to be a joke/troll.

"Very comfortable. I've had pain on the top of my head from other headphones before, but I don't feel any pain/discomfort even when I wear them all day. Comfortable on the ears too, but if you wear glasses, your frames will start to get uncomfortable after a while.The charge lasts all day at least (I charge it every night out of habit).

At first, all I could see was her lips moving until I took the headphones off. Evidently, I also didn't hear her yelling down to me to see what the cat's problem was or the cat whining in the next room.

"Bought these headphones to reduce distraction while reading or completing training for work. I know that noise ""cancelling"" is not noise ""isolating"" but there is little to know difference when NC is turned on. You could hear a pen drop as if you never had the headphones on at all. The description says that these headphones filter out low frequency noise but I can still hear the constant low hum of my AC running. I would say they cancel about 5%. Music quality, however, is great. But if you are buying these purely for noise cancelling purposes, steer clear.. buy noise ISOLATION head phones instead.",3,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0

These were very easy to set up and pair with a number of different devices.They are comfortable to wear.  The shipping was very fast.  My only criticism would be,5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"For starters, the price is worth these headphones and more. The sound is wonderful, especially if you want more of a flat sound without treble or low boost. The bass is very clear and strong. They are extremely comfortable. I wore them throughout my entire non-stop flight from the West Coast to the East coast. I forgot I had them on when I left my seat. They are not as ""soundproof"" as Bose, however, the quiet sounds that I heard of the plane and the baby crying two seats behind me, disappeared with the noise-cancelling on, once my itunes music played and even with the great sound of film I watched on my ipad. I just bought 2 more. Also, I bought the TACTRONICS Wireless Stereo Transmitter that works perfectly with the Bluetooth within the headphones and a case",5,1,2017-8-17,1,0,0

I love everything about these head phones.  I can do gardening videos and music on-line and never bother Gramps at all!  I can even get up and go to the kitchen and keep listening to what's playing on my laptop.Perfect!,5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"I wanted headphones that I could use at the gym and while streaming movies on my computer. These headphones fit the bill in every category. They were easy to set up and pair with my phone for playing music at the gym and also pairing with the Bluetooth on my computer. The sound quality is crisp and clear, the high and low tones are sharp and they headphones fit snugly to cancel out any outside noises. This was an excellent purchase for me.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
These things are wonderful. Solid design. Fits well on my head and ears even wearing glasses. I wear them a majority of the day and they are very comfortable. Sound quality is really good and I wish they would oair nativel with my PS4 so I could use them for gaming as well. I know I could make them work for that but it would require being wired and I already have the PS Platinum wireless headset.,5,1,2018-3-1,1,0,0

"Purchased a Bluetooth Capable TV and need a set of Noise cancelling headphones with good base and sound to compliment the TV.  Read several reviews on regarding the Cowin E7's and decided to give them a try.  What a great purchase!!!  They filter out all of the surrounding noise (kids, other TV, etc) and provide great in-sync sound with the TV programs.  Definitely would recommend the Cowin E7's!!!",5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"Bluetooth Works...but barely. It connects to the devices, but the microphone is crap when using bluetooth. Complaints about crackling, and broken audio. Sometimes they can't hear me at all. Other times they are saying it sounds like I'm under water. I am literally standing directly next to the device, so I know I'm not out of range. The microphone is just crap when using hands free which is the whole reason I bought this headset in the first place. So I'm still tethered to my devices and down nearly 60 bucks. not happy really to be honest.",1,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
My son received these for his birthday and has been very happy with them ever since. He is impressed with the noise cancellation and says it's the best quality audio he has ever heard. We had to purchase a bluetooth dongle for his PC so he can use them with his PC.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"I bought these to use watching movies on  my laptop, and am pleased with the value they offer for the price. Good bass response that ads punch to soundtracks, and comfortable enough to wear for  a few hours at a stretch. I have a large head, and have no trouble with fit of the band although they are more ""on-ear"" than over. So far, I'm pleased with their performance and durability.",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

"Very light, comfortable fit and great sound. Not a single connection issue via Bluetooth encountered with any of my audio sources. Noise cancellation very effective. After the recommended charging time completed, I used these headphones approximately 11 hours and still not needing to recharge. My other headset has max of 4 hours before shutting down. Will I buy these again? Apparently so, my wife tried them out and now she wants a pair. Great product at an economical price. Kudos Cowin!",5,1,2018-1-19,1,1,0
"These are a great budget option for noise cancelling  headphones. The noise cancelling feature is not the best on its own, but combined with when you're playing music, it's hard to heard really anything else. And the music quality is great too! The battery life lasts forever it seems, I've only charged them once so far. The only downside is you can't really move around too much with the noise cancelling feature turned on be because it cuts out when you do and can be annoying.",5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"The Cowin E7 headphones outperform many others that I’ve owned and used! Actually, they perform on par with other brands that cost several times what these sell for. They clearly have exceptional engineering! Good going, Cowin! Keep up the really good work!",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0

"These headphones are AMAZING!! Why spend 400$ on 'Beats' when you can get these high quality headphones for a fraction of the price.  I got these as a gift for my best friend and he can't stop thanking me for them.

"I.Am.Thoroughly.Impressed! These are the one.The box it arrives in, the carry bag, the notice/warranty card from the company and the headphones are all of a seemingly different class. At 49.99. I'ts unbeatable quality! I dare say... this is the best purchase I've ever made. I feel good about it.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,1
"These headphones work right out of the (fancy) box. The sound quality and mic quality are great and the headphones are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time (great for video calls and webinars!).  The noise-cancelling is good (doesn't compare to the super expensive brands like Bose, but is still decent). The charge lasts for a while, and the voice telling you to recharge the headphones isn't aggressively loud or repetitive (like some other brands are). The headphones also come with a nice bag to carry the headphones in. Overall very happy with the purchase and would recommend.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"UPDATE: THIS COMPANY IS ANAZING. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER SEEN. After my review, I was contacted by COWIN customer service and they replaced my head phones and expedited the shipping.

This product works really well and has a long lasting charge.  I bought it so that when I was working from home it  shut out the noise of others.  If they are talking loudly you can still hear them but it does a nice job.  They are also comfortable to wear.,5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
The noise cancelling was the main reason of my purchase of this product. I am very impressed with Cowin's customer service team. My first pair that I ordered did not meet my expectations but this organization stands behind their product like no other company that I have dealt with in the past 5-10 years. The customer service rep fixed my issue immediately and I am in business to study in peace and quiet during this quarantine. Thank you Cowin and your great customer service team as your product is doing what I purchased it to do. Great customer service!,5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
These headphones are great for the price. I use them with my Xbox and Roku .. the sound is great. The charge lasts pretty long. It seems like I only have to charge them every few weeks and I use them pretty frequently.,5,1,2018-12-20,1,2,0
"I don't usually write reviews. However, since I have become a Prime member and rely on reviews now before I purchase a product, I realize how important they are. There are only two words to describe this product and that is 'great headphones'. I really wanted a pair of Bose noise cancellation headphones, especially watching the commercials they kept airing. But I didn't want to pay $300. My co-worker recommended these and I'm so glad he did. The noise cancellation is just ok, but the quality in the sound of the music and the look and feel of these are great.",5,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
The swivel features on the sides of the headphones is good in theory but ultimately is what caused the headphones to break for me. Now one earphone just hands by a wire from the frame.The microphone is pretty much unusable for phone calls if you are anywhere with ambient noise. The noise cancelling was alright as was the audio quality.,4,1,2019-4-2,1,0,0
3 stars due it breaking after 6months of use the cup has detached from the band and is hanging by its wire otherwise it still works wonderfully but its sketchy to use ... it's a wonderful product but isnt robust to everyday use,3,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"I am not an acoustic aficionado by any stretch, but if you are looking for an affordable entry point into wireless, noise cancelling headphones, the Cowin E7 is a nice alternative to Bose and other high end vendors.  Great value for your money!  Also, I tried the E7 Pro [upgraded] version, and while good, I didn't notice an appreciable difference.  I also liked the Cowin emphasis on charitable giving.  They contributed $5 to Save the Children Charity Fund for me to submit this product review, which I probably would not have done otherwise :)",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I paid $60 for these and was extremely excited to get them because they had great reviews. However, they are terrible for phone calls. I work for a telecom company and I purchased these to replace older usb headphones. They do not cancel any noise around you and I often have to switch back to my old headphones because I’m told by the listener that they hear a buzzing noise, almost lost feedback when I’m talking. It is very frustrating to be looking forward to better call quality and sound, but then the headphones don’t live up to their hype. Don’t waste your money— put it towards Bose or Beats headphones instead.",1,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
I'm very dissappointed in the E7 the noise cancelation does not work at all there is no deep base sounds when you crank it full blast the musis not crisp I find it distorted I will be returning there tomorrow and get s much better quality headset oh and it's a fingerprint magnet also the ear muffs do not fit well around your ear,2,1,2017-11-8,1,2,0
"Great headphones for on the airplane.  Drown out the engine noise and crying babies for the most part.  Can’t beat it for the price and the battery truly does last very long.  Right headphone was making a weird noise when on noise canceling mode one day but it stopped and hasn’t happened again, so no real complaints as of today.",4,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
I can't believe how well these headphones perform.  And the price is definitely right.  I bought these for myself as a Christmas gift.  Unfortunately I have leukemia and spend hours in the chemo infusion labs Monday through Friday.  I get through it by listening to my music with noise cancelling headphones.  But my current pair are wired and over ten years old which inspired me to look for a pair of wireless headphone so they don't get mixed in with the tubing from my infusions.  I checked all the reviews and chose these as they are within my price range.  Several of the nurses in the chemo labs have also expressed interest in purchasing these headphone.,5,1,2017-12-14,1,0,0

"Comfortable, and great looking. I have had these headphones for nearly 2 years, and love everything about them. When I was in the hospital, they allowed me to shut out all the usual hospital noises and listen to my music. They work great on airplanes. But best of all, the customer service is 5 star. When I had an issue with the swivel on one of the earpads, they sent me a new one immediately. Impressive! No need to spend $300 to get good quality. Buy Cowin.",5,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"Seriously!! If you can’t afford Bose or Beats!! Well forget about those. I do have some Bose ahead phones and Cowin E7 comes in a nice box with a carrying bag. The best part is, comfort. I’ve worked out in them, done chores around the house and even used, heavy machinery, lawnmowers and a leaf blower. The noise cancellation works and the blue tooth syncing is simple and easy to install. If I can buy 3 more I would for all of my family. Soooo worth the money.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I purchased these and 2 other pairs for my mother, daughter and myself. Today, I had a long test in the hospital that required me to be there for four hours. I was so glad that I planned ahead and brought my new Cowin E7 Noise Cancelling headphones. The sound was beautiful and clear for movies and music while I waited.  In addition, they are very comfortable, and my sound did not disturb anyone in my vicinity. My daughter uses hers for gaming and phone calls, and is very pleased. I definitely feel that I am winning with these purchases.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"The best sound quality. This is my second pair. My first pair broke and I returned to vendor who contacted me directly and gave me a gift certificate to repurchase the product. In the interim, I bought another pair of wireless headphones. I liked those too, but the quality wasn't the same. The comfort level and ease of use weren't up to the Cowin E7 standards. So I went back to quality, and I still haven't used the gift certificate!!",5,1,2018-2-11,1,0,0
"I didn't know cost effective alternatives existed so I didn't have to spend over $300.  This was a nice set to find that actually works.  They are comfortable.  I can wear them for hours and not feel like my head is squished.  The noise canceling works well.  I have gone through air ports and I can actually hear myself think.  They are easy to use and pair devices.  I would buy again.  My hope is that in the future there will be head sets that not only noise cancel, but block out all noise like shooting muffs.  I don't want to hear anything but the music I turn on!",5,1,2016-10-12,1,0,0
What is the sound quality like? It's super sweet in my opinion. I can't really compare it as I haven't owned too many pairs of headphones in my time but they sound pretty sweet to me.They feel nice when worn on the head for any amount of time. Has the right cushioning in the right places.,5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
Initially the first headphones I received did not charge. I emailed Cowin and they said to charge for 8-12 hours for a fully charged headphone.  Tried that and it still would not work.  They sent a new one out and received it in 2 days. No problem.  Works great. Nice to hear a company that stands behind what they say. Getting one for my wife too.,5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"After suffering through the incessant drone of the noise from jet engines during my flights I finally began to notice that some passengers were wearing over the ear headphones.  I took the plunge and bought the Cowin E7, and wow, was I surprised at what a difference they made in my air travel experience.  I was actually able to enjoy watching a movie or listening to a podcast during the flight and even after 3 hours of use they were still very comfortable.  I've used them on 6 flights so far, and these headphones are now a permanent addition to my travel kit.",5,1,2019-3-9,1,0,0

The noise cancelling is great!  I don't hear any air conditioner running anymore and the sound of people talking around me has been *greatly* reduced.  I haven't noticed any issues w/ the battery life, but I tend to plug them in when I'm not using them.  All in all, very happy with this purchase and would (and have!) definitely recommend to others!",5,1,2017-8-7,1,0,0

Besides my wife, these are my best flight buddies.",5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"These headphones are a great value compared to comparable pairs.  I purchased them to use on the lawn mower, and they do a pretty good job of cancelling that noise out.

It's easily fixed by using the provided 3.5mm aux cord when there's interference.",4,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"I’ve never used noise canceling headphones before, so I don’t have much of a comparison to offer.  But for two 14-hour flights between JFK and Tokyo these really delivered a great value for the money.  I saw another review that complained of the round shape of the ear covering (totally true.... human ears aren’t round) and that’s accurate - it was a little uncomfortable after about 10 hours.  But still better than the discomfort of listening to all the other things in coach class for 14 hours.",5,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0

Sound quality is great for the price and the Active Noise Cancelling worked decently well on the flight, drowning out the major engine noise and the nearby passengers.Comfort was good as well.  as with all things they will start to hurt after a long extended use ( have dumbo ears), but the soft padded cups are very comfortable on the ears none the less.",4,1,2018-10-14,1,0,0
"For the price point, these are great headphones. The noise canceling feature works great for drowning out outside sound.

I’ve purchased a few pairs of headphones and these are by far the best. The sound quality is good. The noise canceling is the best. I really like the ability to use them on a phone call.

Love them. Sound quality on a noisy train during my commute is great.  Battery lasts a long time. My commute is 1.5 hours each way and these last weeks.Noise canceling is ok.

These are very good headphones for the price. The noise cancellation feature seems to work very well and the sound has a very wide range from bass to treble. They are comfortable.

I am very pleased with this purchase. Not only do the headphones work very well but they have also helped me with my living situation. I have to have the volume on my TV above 7 to hear it. Anything above 7 is very disturbing to my roommates. Also I sleep with the TV on which also disturbs my roommates so when it is time to go to sleep. I turn the volume all the way up on the headphones and the ear pads out and lay the headphones next to my head when I lay down. I can hear it and do not disturb anyone else. This is the best purchase I have made in a very long time.,5,1,2018-5-7,1,2,0
"The COWIN E7 headphones are comfortable and light.  The battery life is excellent and I am impressed with the high quality sound.  No issues with bluetooth connectivity.

I’m really liking these headphones. I use them at work with an aux cord mostly but I tested the Bluetooth range with my phone and it worked in less than a minute at a pretty far distance. The quality seems pretty high and they are soft and comfortable to wear for a long time. It had a rubberish smell when I first opened the box but that quickly faded. I also like that even without music playing I was able to block noise out. I think this is good when I have to concentrate but when others in the office are talking.

I use them when I'm working out, traveling, or tuning out the background noise in the office. They are not Bose quality, but at the price point you would be a cool to expect it. I love the way these headphone feel, the size of them, and the volume control I have on the headset.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
I have always wanted a pair of noise canceling headphones and the popularity of these on Amazon made it difficult to refuse giving them a try.  I love them.  I recently flew to the east coast and had a very enjoyable 3 hour ride.  The ear pads are comfortable and the sound quality was good.,5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
Noise cancellation and sound is very very good. Overall these are near perfect headphones. The only issues I have is just how bulky they are (they’re much wider than typical headphones) and the sound carries loudly outside of your own ears. But if you don’t mind everyone else around you listening to your music then I highly recommend these,4,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
The 3rd time is the charm. This is my 3rd try at blue-tooth headphones. The 1st two either broke or were very uncomfortable or both. You can use these for hours. I forget I have them on! Noise cancellation is great!. setup is simple. All in all thee headphones are well worth it.,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1
"I have a small head and these were fairly uncomfortable. It also seemed like the BT and ANC settings were switched on my headphones. (2/5 stars)7/17 Update: Cowin very kindly sent me a new pair of headphones. My mother tried them and said she found them comfortable. We both liked the wireless capabilities and found it very convenient. The ANC works well for blocking ambient noise, but you can still hear someone if they are talking right next to you. Overall, I am happy with this product.",4,1,2017-5-30,1,0,0
"When I saw how many 5 star ratings and reviews these had, I just knew they were going to be a great replacement for my bluetooth Sonys. Packaging is great and, for the most part, the look and feel was on par with higher priced ones. These are not for anyone who listens to a wide range of music. The noise cancelling essentially takes noise out of the music and doesn't really cancel, in my opinion. The bass is almost non existent, which will make or break most of the music that I listen to. Although the bargain on these is unbelievable, I'll be sending mine back tomorrow.",3,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

"Unlike other wireless over the ear headphones, these are not collapsible and become a hassle to lug around if you're a daily commuter. Their bulk also makes me feel silly wearing them while walking or on the train / bus. They just look comically oversized ! That said, however, the battery life and sound quality is fantastic. They are a godsend on long-haul flights and significantly tune out the noisy environment. The price is also unbeatable. While I love these for flying, studying in a library, or for my own use at home, I just can't recommend these to anyone looking for commuter headphones.",4,1,2018-4-5,1,0,0

"I initially purchased these headphones in May 2017. I have enjoyed using them frequently over the past year and a half. The other day, however, the plastic casing connecting the earphone to the headband popped off. The audio still functions, but the plastic no longer holds them together. I didn't hit or drop the headphones, they seemed to pop apart on their own after a year and a half of use.IMO these are good headphones for the value, but that doesn't mean they are well made. I assume they are made overseas by a low cost OEM. If you are looking to have the product for more than a year or so, you should probably go with the Bose or another high quality model. If I cant get this figured out, that's what I'll be purchasing next.",4,1,2019-2-6,1,0,1
"Works great, got here quickly, no serious complaints.

I bought these headphones a couple of months ago and I have been using them almost every day since. They are super comfortable and the sound quality is great!!,5,1,2020-4-17,1,2,0
"I have been looking for an affordable pair of over-ear headphones to use while gaming for a while and finally have a pair I really like! With the noise cancellation, they cut out the sound so much I have had people knock on my door (which I am quite close to) and yell for me and I never hear them. Now everyone just texts me when they need my attention. The noise quality (definitely with the noise cancellation on) sounds amazing. It is awesome knowing where a sound is coming from in-game and hearing the slightest movements from others. I definitely recommend this for gaming if you're looking for something affordable!",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"So for the price these headphones are great. They last a very long time on a short charge time, pair easily with multiple accessories and deliver good noise cancellation. The bass could be a bit improved as well as the crispness of the music but altogether it is a good set of wireless headphones. One beef I have is determining how to use the volume buttons on the side of the unit. They are not marked which makes it hard to guess which is the volume up and down and to advance tracks.",4,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"My 14 year old loves these.  I love them as well, as I do not have to listen to the videos that he likes to watch.  Not really sure about the sound quality, but I did not care.  The headphones have made my house a less annoying place.",5,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
Noise cancelling seems to work good but I need to hear background noise when on the tractor. When used without the noise cancelling the sound is sooo bad and bassy that you really cannot understand what's playing. Quality is poor and if I chose to use them they would break in no time.,2,1,2020-8-20,1,1,0
"Good headphones for the price.  Sound is not as detailed as my higher quality phones but is very pleasant to listen to.Update:  I am appreciating and liking the E7 headphones more and more all the time.  They are really good, especially for the price.",4,1,2019-5-26,1,0,0

"Awesome!!  I do landscaping and these do a great sound of drowning out the motors, but I can still hear when someone yells my name.  Very, very happy with this purchase.  Battery seems to last for days.I've been caught in the rain multiple times wearing these and they are still going strong.",5,1,2017-7-26,1,1,0
"This was my first pair of bluetooth / noise canceling headphones. I didn't want to invest too much but was about to take cross country trip/flights.  The battery life lasted through two flights coast to coast.  Noise canceling worked better than expected for the price point.  Slept like a baby through both flights.  I don't like to wear them at work because they work too well and no one can get my attention.  I'll likely upgrade one day, but as of right now....there's no reason to.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"These headphones were uncomfortable at first, since I haven't had any headphones in a long time. After some time getting used to the sound, bass, noise cancellation, they're actually pretty good. It gets the job for me. It's awesome to have this NFC feature when I can connect them with a single tap from my smartphone. Anyone out there that wants decent headphones without hurting your wallet, give these a shot.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
This headset has a premium feel to it and doesn't hurt my ears even after eight hours of continuous use. I am able to easy switch between audio sources and the battery life is as advertised.

"First, a small criticism- the bass is just a little too heavy, and on some recordings, can be downright annoying.However, the sound quality is excellent overall, with clear, crisp highs and good placement. The controls work well, and the blue tooth paired with both my laptop and my smart phone quickly and flawlessly. Overall, this is a great headphone for the modest price of $59. I'd recommend them to anyone who wants a fine blue tooth headphone for less than $60.",5,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0

These work fine if you are the only one around. Unfortunately if you are listening to music and anyone is within about 20 yards of you they are likely to hear it and if they get close enough that can even make out the words.,2,1,2019-5-5,1,1,0
I have aways preferred headphones over earbuds.  These COWIN E7 wireless headphones are great.  They provide clear sound and have a good battery life.  Highly recommend this item if you like to workout to your rhythm of music.  The only down side and why 4 and not 5 stars is they don't stay in place during dynamic movement.,4,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0
They worked right out of the box.  Easy instructions.  Bluetooth connection worked fine.  Clear sound and noice cancellation exists just does not block out all but muffles well...  No problems.  Nice case and charging cord and device cord connection all included.,4,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0
"I use these headphones to listen to streaming TV on my mobile device.  They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever purchased, and have a great sound quality.  When they need charging, they let me know, and it only takes about 3 hours to fully charge them.  Then, I can use them for days - and I use them for several hours each day.  Great product. Great quality.  Great value!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"In comparison to high-end noise-cancelling headphones, these are good ones. They work well even with just being ""on"", without the noise cancelling function. However, I find the battery life way too short. I often use headphones up to 6 hours a day at work and they won't last two days on a single charge. Would not buy again. Too much of a pain when they day mid-day.",3,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0
I bought these a while ago before moving.  When I got around to using them they would not connect!  I even had a professional try to connect them and was unsuccessful.  Unfortunately it was too late to return.  Very expensive mistake.,1,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

"Seem to be very durable. Bought these for my wife to watch movies on her tablet. Easy to use, battery lasts quite a while before needing recharged. Sound quality is great. Love the noise cancelling feature. I love loud music, so I only wish they were a little louder. This didn't stop me from ordering a pair for myself!  Did I mention that the sound quality is phenomenal! Knocking off one star because the only way to charge them is though a USB port on my computer. Really needs a wall charger.",4,1,2016-11-30,1,0,0
"This company has the best customer service. They truly are loyal to their customers and have great products for the price. These headphones sound amazing! very clear quality perfect amount of bass needed. The wireless feature is also great I can have these on my head and my phone will be in a different room. The connection is still there, with no interruption. Cowin, you have a great thing going. Hopefully, you guys will start making wireless earbuds in the future.

The sound quality wasn't there. I have heard better sound from a toy pair of headphones. The picture makes them look big. I have a normal size head and my ears we're scrunched. Did not feel comfortable. After a short time i had to take them off.  I realize they are under a hundred bucks but don't waste your money and steer clear of these headphones. Im giving one star because the blue tooth was easy to pair,1,1,2019-5-11,1,1,0
"My wife's BOSE headphones started to fall apart so she started using mine. I did not want to spend too much money to replace them so bought the COWIN headphones as a cheaper alternative. However, I was pleasantly surprised that I really could hear no difference. Plus, mine were not noise cancelling and these are. So, at this point, I am very happy with them. Plus, a nice color selection and it connects to my blue tooth devices with less problems. Great product!",5,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"Good sound quality, battery length, and so easy to pair to our new iPad. I can’t really speak about the noise canceling because we’re in a very quiet house, but it seems to work well here. Used by an elderly person.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"My son likes these better than his Skullcandy, comparable model.  He is a jazz pianist and very picky about sound.  Also, they feel more durable, but time will tell.  Very comfortable.  Noise cancellation has an on/off switch.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"Picked up these for my little alien-ware alpha and man i gotta say. The build quality and audio are superb, They are comfortable as can be, They dont feel cheap in the slightest, and classical piano rings out very nicely at full volume as well as electro/glitchhop/dubstep. The active noise canceling blocked out 2 loud kids playing near me as well. The packaging made it feel premium with a leather carrying case, As well as a personal thank you letter form the designers haha. Anyone wants a reasonably priced bluetooth headset i highly recommend theseUPDATE: Its now February 2nd 2019, I purchased this headset March 1st 2018. Ive used these headphones Every single day for at least 6 hours a day. They are holding up perfectly, no reduction in sound quality or battery life, No physical wear at all. I HIGHLY recommend these",5,1,2018-3-4,1,0,0
"Great product, love how it works.  Have mine linked to multiple different PCs plus a phone, works like a charm.  First night I had it, I used it in wired mode and heard something in a symphony that I've listened to for 25 years that I'd never realized was there, the audio is that good.Had one problem with the post that allows the ear cups to spin where the retaining clip broke free.  Sent an e-mail to Cowin on Friday, they asked for a picture of the damage on Saturday, and by Monday morning, I had an e-mail back from them with a code to get a replacement.  This company seriously knows how to do customer support.",5,1,2018-5-7,1,0,0

"I bought these wireless bluetooth noise cancelling head phones for my daughters birthday.  I was sick of always having to hear her blasting music or on face time convers and tions with her friends.  I loved how promptly they were delivered and their sleek design.  They work with any bluetooth device and are just as good with sound, (bass, treble, noise cancellation) as my sisters beats by dre that cost her almost 4x the cost.  So far my daughter has never ran into a situation where it died on her after a day of use.  I charge it nightly nonetheless but battery life is great...I definitely recommend this product! 5 stars",5,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
Outstanding product. Had a pair of Beats plug in that I used at work. Wanted to get wireless and couldn’t afford the new Beats wireless. Decided to try these. Noise cancelling was an added bonus. These have really good sound. Wish I had discovered these years ago.,5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0
These are my favourite headphones. I worked in radio for 17 years and had many Sets on my ears. I love the noise cancelling and the sound is awesome. I like a bit more bass. Since that's not adjustable I'll take them the way they are. These ever go out I'll be on as soon as to get a new pair.,5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0

I felt in my own little cocoon and even slept several hours with them on as it was so quiet.  For anyone wanting earphones for this purpose who doesn’t want to spend the money on the Bose or Sony, these are a great alternative for the price.  They were akso pretty comfortable still after 10 hours of wearing.  Very satisfied.",5,1,2017-10-27,1,0,0

"The first pair I bought kept losing the signal and when I was connected it was static and not good audio.  I contacted Amazon and found out I missed my return date by only a week.  They told the company and Cowin contacted me, offered me a replacement and I received it yesterday.  After binge watching TV most of the night, there were no lost connections, no static and the sound quality was amazing.  The first pair were just a bad set but now I know what everyone is raving about.  Great customer service and great product.  Thank you!",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"It’s ok, just ok. To be completely honest it’s not very loud if you like loud headsets this is not the one for you. My 40$ Skullcandy Headphones have better sound quality and are much louder. The entire reason I got these though was because I didn’t want a wire. And it works just find in that sense. The base, well it sounds muffled, and I don’t know if it’s because I’m not use to noise cancel headphones or something else. Very comfortable as well. Noise canceling does work, but I still think it should be able to play music louder. If you like it quieter then go for it👍",3,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

I absolutely love the quality of sound that comes out of these headphones. From treble to bass you can distinguish each level with a crisp clear impeccable sound. I have purchased many sets from earbuds to over-the-head headphones very much like the E7's and no sound has compared to the listening pleasure I get from the E7. Fantastic difference.,5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace some high end Sony headphones that broke. Unfortunately headphones can be like expensive sunglasses, not always worth it to buy the high end brands when you will still eventually break or lose them. So I went looking for a lower cost alternative and found these. The Cowin headphones are well worth the cost, high quality, looks great, and comes with a nice carrying bag so it's easier to keep them organized (and so they are less likely to get broken). Functionally, I like the battery life, and the option to use it either wired or bluetooth. Great product overall.",4,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0

I sleep with the Cowin E7 every night and all night.  I find them extremely comfortable and I  can't hear my wife's Oxygen concentrator or her CPAP or even my alarm.

These have great sound quality and feel cozy on my ears. The controls are in the right spot but these are quiet as a mouse. I’m hearing impaired and I’ll be sending these back sadly. I wanted to love them but no.,4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"As others have pointed out, it's disappointing that you still need to power these headphones even if you attach an audio cable between it and the audio source. Also, the noise cancelling feature isn't that distinctive.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

I bought these for myself for noise cancelling to watch movies on the airplane.  They are bluetooth but also have a line in cord.  The battery life is great and it comes with a travel bag.  I gifted these to 3 people for Christmas.,5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"These headphones look and sound great.  However, they kept losing connection with my PC, and I had to keep reconnecting them. They finally went out altogether and I could not pair it with my PC or my wife's PC.  I don't know if I just got a bad one or what, but I don't know if I want to take the chance on this again.  I had it less than 2 months.",2,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
"Overall it's a solid pair of headphones. Decent Quality, the best part is the Noise Cancellation. I had to fix some tweaks to my Spotify equalizer settings at first, after I got that calibrated, everything else fell into place. This product exceeded my expectation for an under $50 headphone, on top of that the company gives you an 18 month money back guarantee. Definitely give them a shot it's a bang for your buck.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

"they noise cancelling works great, i would walk by construction on the way to class and it would cancel out pretty much everything, even if i went through it. also brought it on a trip to asia (over 24 hours of flights) and it worked great on cancelling out the engines (when on bluetooth) they're also very comfortable and have great sound, it has a nice bass but not overpowering.I did have a problem after heavy usage (around 6 months) and the speaker would rattle a little. then an ear fell off the headband. again, heavy usage between me and my backpack with school books. i probably didn't store them as well as i should have... anyways, i contacted cowin and they said that's covered under warranty and hooked me up with another pair, which i was more than willing. I would say they're my favorite pair of headphones i've had, for comfort, sound, and noise block ability. to finish it off, Cowin has been great for working with to replace the headphones!",5,1,2017-7-17,1,0,0

"Unfortunately, these headphones didn’t work out for me. And by the time I gave up on them and decided to return them it was too late. I’ve used them maybe two or three times. When I play music there’s hardly any “noise canceling” - I can still hear the tv on in the background clear as day when I’m working from home. And I get static or a really high pitched ringing every so often which scares the crap out of me and I fling them off my head.

It really helps me to focus.",4,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
I had lowered my expectations for the active noise cancelling due to such and affordable price.  However when I received these headphone I was pleasantly surprised that they out preformed my expectations by a mile.  These are comfortable and I wear them for two hour long Webex meetings many times a week.  There rendition of musical  sound is on par with more expensive headphones such as Bose.  I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for above average noise cancelling headphones and do not want to part with many hundreds of dollars.,5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
This is my first set of wireless headphones. Decided to get these instead of ear buds. Very happy with my decision. The noise reduction pretty much shuts off the outside world. The headphones are very comfortable and you don't even notice that you are wearing them. The only negative  is with the battery. I wish that there was an indicator on the headphones that displayed remaining battery life. My iphone indicates the headphone charge on the screen but my Kindle does not. The headphones beep when battery is low but that isn't really sufficient.,4,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
I was looking for headphones to use on a plane and have not been able to try them for that yet.  My initial testing does show that they do reduce background noise and the music and audio sound fine to me.  They cover the ear completely.  There was no issue connecting them via Bluetooth to my tablet or computer. Very happy with them.,5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
I use these for watching TV.  I have bad ear ringing and my roommates love to scream at me over my volume.  These guys have me listening at half my normal volume.  The bass is just right for podcasts and TV news.  Drama shows bring the action right into your ears with these.  I've tried a lot of far more expensive brands.  All of them are in storage.  Cowin is a winner for personal listening and comfort.,5,1,2019-7-6,1,0,0
I bought this due to the raving reviews. I am an online instructor and need the mic to work. My students said that I sounded awful and so I returned this immediately. I ended up buying a wired mic for $20 and the mic works amazingly well.,1,1,2019-3-22,1,1,0
Was looking for a reasonably priced headphone after looking at headphones for $300.00 plus.  These are by far the greatest set money can buy for $59.95 on Amazon.  I bought them in black so I saved $10.00 over ones of color. They are so comfortable and light you don’t know they’re on. It paired instantly with my TV and sounds great with or without the noise cancelling feature. I really can’t tell the difference when the NC is on except the sound is slightly crisper. I like  that I can watch what I want and as loud as I need without bothering my wife who is on the computer. I give this five stars all the way .,5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0

"These headphones are good for music but not so good for phone conversations. When I use them for hands free talking, the person on the other end say that I sound muffled and far away.

I live with my daughter and two grandchildren and sometimes the noise i just too much for this grandma. I was introduced to a much more expensive brand of noise cancelling headphones that are way beyond my budget on a trip I took. When comparison shopping I decided to try these. They exceeded my expectations! For example I was in my room wearing them with music playing quietly through them and my daughter called me for dinner. Because I didn't hear her she got closer and closer till she finally stood beside me and actually startled me because I never heard a thing.,5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
For the cost I had expected far more from it. The sound is only meh and the bass is almost nonexistent. They are comfortable and do cancel out about 80% of the noise around you though,2,1,2020-5-11,1,2,0
"These are my first set of Bluetooth noise-cancelling headphones....and it's my first review on Amazon. My initial set of headphones that I had ordered had a faulty switch. However, the seller was very responsive and remedied the issue immediately by sending another set. Outside of that issue, the headphones are worth the money. I work in an open office setting with lots of collaboration. I can still hear talking with the noise-cancelling on. However, the reduction of volume is reduced significantly, even before turning on the NC. I will say that the quality of the sound seems to decrease with NC. Sounds great without NC. (In my experience it has been the opposite : Quality of sound is better with NC.)",5,1,2018-9-11,1,0,0
"They arrived in 2 days and i paid for standard shipping. I bought these for my daughters 11th bday and they are amazing. She absolutely loves them.

It took me 6 months to pick a  pair of headphones and I'm so glad I didn't settle! I love these! They are comfortable with fantastic sound. I used them while shoveling snow. I never lost connection they stayed out without fitting to tightly. My mother called during this time and she is dead in one ear and partially deaf in her other ear. I was worried she wouldn't be able to hear me because the mic is embedded in the ear piece. She heard me perfectly. I would definitely reccomend!,5,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0
"I am very picky with my headphones and I listen to everything from classical to rap to metal and pop and so far with every genre I listen to the bass has great response, sounds amazing, it’s crystal clear, sounds 3D in my opinion.

"I bought this product and received it today, upon opening the package, there were fingerprints  all over the ear pieces and smudges. I tried them on since I was considering keeping them, so the sound quality was pretty good but then I saw some sticky residue on one of the earpieces. So that was a bummer. I wanted headphones sooner than later and don't want to spend significant amounts of time to return-exchange-and repeat. The buttons on the earpieces itself are kind of loud and should be more padded or created with different material so the clicking is softer.",2,1,2018-11-2,1,1,0
"1. Appearance :They look good. Sleek, finger prints do show up though. They don't fold but can twist to keep put away easier. Silver and black look good and is cushioned. They are pretty light and the Bluetooth is great so I don't have to use the AUX cable it came with.",5,1,2017-4-5,1,0,0

First I noticed that people cannot understand me when I was wearing them during a phone call now I’ve had them for a little over a month and the sound quality is already starting to fade and I hear a crackling noise the entire time I’m listening to music these are hands-down the worst headphones I’ve ever bought and I will never purchase them again.,1,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
Love these!!  I wore these on a 4 hour flight.  The quality of music and tv shows was spot on.  I didn’t really notice a difference between regular and NC but that didn’t bother me bc I felt it cancelled enough background noise for me.,5,1,2019-5-4,1,0,0

After this impromptu demo, he was more than happy to accept my prized headphones in lieu of the $24 I owed for the ride.

EDIT: The customer service team reached out to me and offered an upgrade to the newer model. Their customer service was fantastic and worked with me to resolve the issues i had. They upgraded the headphones at no cost to me. Very helpful and im greatfull.Worked great for the first week. Then started cutting out and stutter after every three or four songs the second week. Now after 4 weeks they stutter and cut out every song i play. Very annyoing and disappointing considering the price of them.

"I wanted headphones to listen to while traveling. These are convenient and have a sleek appearance. They last about 5-6 hours for me if fully charged, and still play while charging which is convenient. The sound is nice for such a cheap price, and there is no breaking up if on full volume. Be careful sleeping on the sides, they can leave marks in your face from pressure.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
I live in a house with some very loud people. To the point that it stresses me out. These were a solution suggested by a friend of mine and boy do they work!I put them on and even before playing anything it muffles a good bit of sound. It's almost perfect when I have something playing.,5,1,2018-8-1,1,0,0
"For what you pay, these headphones are a steal!!! These bad boys have great range if you walk away from your device, great sound, super long battery life and are super comfy! They're also great in the noise canceling department!!",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"My Cowin E7 will not turn off.... With the power switch off, the headphones constantly connect and disconnect repeatedly!!! It's annoying and I'm ready to toss them in the trash! I haven't even had the headphones for 2 months. Cheap Chinese quality",2,1,2019-2-22,1,1,0
"First I would like to say that the noise cancelling was excellent.....when I sat still and did not move my head. Any time I touched the earpieces with the NC on, my music would be garbled or drop all together. The ear pieces seem flimsy and need to be made out of a sturdier material so that the noise cancelling and audio is not interrupted. Excellent noise cancelling but the overall design needs to be sturdy and reliable to create a quality product. I ended up returning these headphones and requesting a refund.",2,1,2018-4-23,1,1,0
"First pair, slide switch stopped working, would not go into Bluetooth pairing mode. Contacted Cowin and immediately got help and a replacement sent right away. service is great but the switch is so small and needs to be switched on and off often.",4,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
The noise cancellation is very impressive. the tv was on decently loud 6 feet away from us and with the headphones on but not playing you could barely hear it.  The quality and longevity is what i will be curious about.  Right now very happy with the purchase.,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
I like comfort and the easy to wear on my head it doesn't slide off no does it ever feel to tight around my ears . the sound is fantastic.the one thing I would improve is the areas were the plug to recharge be better marked it does disappear into the black finish and you have to bring it in the light to see were it is to attach recharge prong connecter wire .,5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0

"This was about $60 for me. You're paying more for the comfort and bluetooth more than anything. Yes, these are very comfortable. I have a big head too, and these don't squeeze hard at all, but just enough. Noise canceling is ok, not bad. The sound is meh, wouldn't use them for listening to music. They are fantastic for ASMR though! Like I said, you're paying more for the comfort and bluetooth than the sound quality.In short I took off a star for sound, but the comfort was superb. At $60 it's not a bad investment especially for a tight budget.",4,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

I use the headset when I mow the lawn and go to the gym.  The sound quality is just as good as the $200 Sony set I had that broke.  Music quality is great and I can hear it very well over the engine roar of my Toro Zero Turn mower.  Works well at the gym where they play all their loud exercise music in the various classes and I can still hear my music clear as day.  Good value for the price.,4,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0

"These headphones are great for wearing while studying in my rather noisy home. I've never had noise-canceling headphones before, but this work SO well. It mutes the quiet, monotonous noises and dulls the loud, sudden ones. I commonly experience sensory overload, and these remedy the anxiety that comes along with that. They have a long-lasting battery, connect to Bluetooth well, and have great sound quality. Not only that, but they came quickly and were packaged so nicely. If you're on the fence about what kind of noise-canceling headphones to get without breaking the bank, these are the ones. Absolutely wonderful!",5,1,2017-11-14,1,0,0

"I would give you the five star overall they have a good value, but I get a strange hum when using the noise cancellation whether it is wired or using Bluetooth.

My husband also tried to pair the headphones with his Samsung Galaxay S9, and also no joy.

"I have been searching for Noise Cancelling Headphones for about three months. I was searching Google and a brand called ""Cowin"" came up. After reading the reviews and the listed cost, I decided to order them. Once I received them, I was very impress with the packaging and the appearance. Very professional look and user friendly instructions. I was excited to get them charged up and see if the sound would satisfy me. They have incredible sound and are very comfortable!

The sound quality is very good and the sound cancelling is great. I use them on a zero turn mower and mow approx. 18 acres. I have been very satisfied.  5 stars. Would recommend them to everybody. I had a very expensive pair that came up missing at my 4th July party. I was not going to spend that kind of money again when I only had them for 2 months. I bought the corwins at 1/3 the cost and to much surprise they are even better than the ones I lost.,5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
I'm very impressed with the quality of product and service. They paired easily to my TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter and Receiver that is connected to my flat screen.

"I really loved these headphones. Unfortunately, the plastic connector between the speaker and headpiece is rather cheap. As you can see in the picture, the one of the left is broken and I've been making due with duct-tape. Now the other one is broken. I only use these around the house--no gym, jogging, or anything. Tried to get in touch with customer service and never heard back.",2,1,2020-3-22,1,1,1
"Super impressed by these headphones. I wanted wireless over-the-ear headphones, but didn't want to invest $200+ in Beats or Bose. I've had these headphones for over a year and they are still working beautifully. They hold a charge for a really long time..I use them ~2 hours/day and charge them once every 2 weeks. I use my headphones primarily at the gym and they sound great. They also look really cool :-)",5,1,2017-10-13,1,0,0
I liked the product well enough. The bass is non existent.  And the phone call quality is terrible.  The call volume is low compared to music volume but the noise canceling works fine with the music and without. I wouldn't encourage calling if your needing to call.,4,1,2019-5-12,1,0,0
I am very impressed with these bluetooth headphones.  They have worked great with connecting to my TV via bluetooth and are a huge improvement over my old RF headphones.  Battery life has been as advertised and sound quality is great.  I decided to give these a shot based on a better price point than some of the more name brand headphones that cost quite a bit more and I am glad that I did.  Company also offers a 2 year warranty on the headphones.  Overall a great set and I have been using them for over a month now.,5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

This headset is amazing! I work on a huge riding mower on a local golf course and the Noise Cancelling function reduces the mower noise to a low hum. I have played music on them for 6 hours at a time while using the Blue Tooth function while other headsets run out of power by 4 to 4.5 hours. Great headphones!,5,1,2018-6-14,1,1,0
Just out side the service support window. When using the noise cancellation one of the speakers sounds like there is something coming apart in the mic / ear piece. Sounds almost like someone rubbing their hand over the mic. Would return them if I could. I would have thought $70 would have gotten something that would last at least a year.,1,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0
"My battery life is not consistent between charges. I am not sure if I know the reason why, however, upon reading other customer's reviews, it may be because of using the noise cancelling feature at certain times.

"So far, about a week, the headphones/headset are working well. The noise cancelling for listening is pretty impressive for the money. The sound quality is also very good in a noisy room. The only gripe I have is the microphone on the headset is a bit sensitive, the feedback from a call I had is that it sounded like I was in a small room, very echoey, and I was in a fairly small office, but no other headset I’ve used in my office have functioned in this way. So aside from that minor issue I have no complaints.",4,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0

"I've been pretty pleased with these noise canceling headphones while I've had them. The Bluetooth feature is awesome and hooked up to my Mac seamlessly. The sound is better actually when you switch to noise cancelling mode, it's a lot smoother than just the Bluetooth feature. As for just the noise canceling feature for quiet, it's ok. I don't know much about noise canceling technology, as these are the first noise canceling headphones I have, but I got these to block out noisy neighbors and it has been efficient. It blocked out my neighbor talking on the phone which amazed me but I could hear remnants of my elderly neighbor who is hard of hearing's TV below me. Again I don't really know the standard for noise canceling headphones. They are also SUPER comfortable.",4,1,2017-4-10,1,1,0
"They cancel noise and play music wonderfully... on the inside. Unfortunately, everyone around me can ALSO hear my music. No amount of adjusting can make that otherwise.

I fly back and forth to Puerto Rico and it never fails that some parent on the flight has a kid that does not know how not to scream.  These head phones cut that sound out... I think these work just as well as BOSE and at a fraction of the cost.,5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
"Overall I think this is a very good product at a very good price. Although I am not an expert in audio equipment etc I do use headphones on a daily basis for watching programs on my iPad. Battery feels like it last for a long time between charges, I charge it just to make I don't run out of juice about once a week. Only reason I went with 4 stars and not 5 and it may be me; my ears are not fully covered. Still a very good product for the price you pay for them. They also look very nice.",4,1,2017-4-5,1,0,0
"I did a fair amount of research before purchasing these, reading reviews between COWIN, Mpow and TaoTronics, and although I cannot speak for the latter two I am thoroughly satisfied with the COWIN.  Sound quality is everything you could ask for, enough bass to keep people satisfied while the mids and highs are a perfect match.  Battery lasts foreverrr.  The ""I made the right decision"" moment was on the airplane when I turned on the noise cancellation, couldn't even hear the noise from the airplane only the music/movies.  I would suggest this to anyone in this price range.  I have never owned a bluetooth pair of Bose/JBL/Beats/etc so I may be naive in terms of what they have to offer but I have been around enough audio to know that for the price, I doubt it can get much better.",5,1,2018-3-29,1,0,0

"I've had these for a few months now, and they work pretty well for the price.

"I love these. The color, sound quality and noise-canceling ing awesome. The only thing I don't like is that when I switch them to NC (noise-canceling), there's a static-like buzzing in the left side. It becomes less noticable as time goes on. When I'm playing music, I don't hear it at all, but sometimes when listening to meditations or much softer sounds, I do notice it.  In BT mode, I don't have a problem.

"COWIN's headphones are my daily drivers. The over ear cups are comfortable, the battery life is such that I don't worry about going all day using them before docking them for the night. The Play/Pause button on the right cup works for most audio software applications too. The Active Noise Cancellation works best for low frequency background, like air conditioning or airplane vibrations. They even look nice. I recommend these headphones for anyone needing Bluetooth connectivity and not willing to spend hundreds of dollars. COWIN's E7 is a great bargain.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

"The headphones were great for the first few weeks. However there is an issue with the now to where the Bluetooth connectivity is muffled, but when the wire I used they work fine.

I was going to wait until my trip to Europe to write this review to test the noise cancelling. Well I tried to see how they faired against my tractor mower. Not only did they block out alot of the mower sound but I didnt have to blast my ears off to hear even the softest part of a song.

"The head phones work great. They are very comfortable, the sound quality is great. They have both standard bluetooth and noise cancelling, both are great.

Joey reached out to me and offered to replace them because he believed it was a faulty pair and he was right. 10/10 customer service, quick and prompt. As for the headphones I love them. I bought them to replace my old gym headphones which were beats solo 2 wireless. In my opinion these headphones are a lot better. They have an excellent noise cancelling feature, great sojnd quality and are way more comfortable. Also these headphones don't seem to hold the smell of sweat like my beats did. Overall great product!.",5,1,2016-9-23,1,2,0
I like the headphones a lot. I find that really don't use the noise cancelling part but just turn on some music when I get to the office. Sound is good. Comfort is good.

"I wear headphones all day long and really appreciate how comfortable these E7’s are to wear for long periods of time. Battery life is good and sound and NC is good as well. I also really like the option to use a 3.5mm headphone jack.Only things i don’t like but are in no way problems for me is that the volume buttons on the right ear “feel” backwards to me, i constantly find myself turning the volume down instead of up. The other con is that you have to use battery power to use the 3.5mm functionality, which does bug me just a little bit.",4,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0

Obviously you cant expect it to outperform headsets that are twice the price, but for half the price you get 3\4 the quality in sound and finish.

"The appearance of the headphones are nice, they look more expensive than they are. Sound quality is good for what I can tell, I haven't really owned or tried an expensive pair of headphones so I can't really compare them to something else. I'd say that the noise canceling blocks out most noises but not all, it also depends on how loud you have the headphones and what you are listening to. Battery life will easily last for 2-3 days depending on how much you use them, they have 30 hours of battery so if you use them around 10 hours a day they will last for 3 days. Comfort is really good, I,can wear them for long periods of time, unlike my old headphones.This is my second pair of them and I have to say that customer service at Cowin is amazing, on my first pair the noise canceling was not working at all and the headphones fully stopped working after only a few hours of use, luckily I was able to get a brand new pair for free.",4,1,2017-8-14,1,0,0

You can control the volume and selection from buttons on the side. we used our headphones on a long airplane flight. It noise was cancelled out and I was able to here my book without blasting my ear drums. We don't tend to use the control buttons on the side but as with anything like this you have to get use to it.,5,1,2017-6-15,1,0,0
Bought for my husband for Christmas gift. He loves them!We are in June & the charging port is now not working properly. He has to wedge the charging cord to stay in one place so they will charge.  That’s not good.,5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"the mic doesn't work properly. No one can hear me. On top of that, the headphones are super heavy and give me a headache only a minute after putting it on. I am very disappointed and am returning them.",1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"As soon as I put these headphones on, I was in love with the sound quality. However, I don’t notice a difference when turning noise cancelation on, and the sound bleeds a lot. It’s fine for my use - public transportation - but if you’re sharing a room with someone at home they’ll likely hear your music in the quiet.",3,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Love these good sound, noise cancellation seen better, but sound quality is good material comfortable but the shiny parts not metal it is plastic so time will tell its endurance. For the rest i give thumb s up.",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"I originally wrote that I probably did not understand what noise canceling was. I still don't, but I didn't intend to give these a negative review, it was more neutral. They are fine. Amazon Choice. Better price than the rest.",4,1,2019-3-11,1,0,0
Good headphones but hurts ears after a while. As far as noise cancelling they do but they don't because the volume doesn't go very loud.  I travel weekly and if tou want true noise cancelling then biy a better pair.  But good set of headphones for price.,2,1,2019-7-22,1,1,0
"These headphones are the best I’ve ever used.  Im not an audiophile but I can tell sound quality and these deliver it in spades.  Well built, too.  I can wear for hours without having to shift in my head and the battery life is very good.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"Bought these to try using over my bte hearing aids.  Do an excellent job of filtering out ambient noise and the microphone is quite good. Seem to have a very long talk/listen time per charge, only charge every few days.  Begin to become uncomfortably tight and heavy when wearing for an extended time and sound is not the best quality. These work very well for the occasional phone call or zoom meeting, can understand much more of the conversation than a computer or phone speaker.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Great sound quality and can be used as a portable speaker. Noise cancellation is excellent, blocks out all ambient sounds so all I hear is music. Bluetooth range also better than expected! Took a chance and tried a  different brand with Cowin. Now I know why so many others use their products. Definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
These are great. I can use them through my whole house.,5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"Not Bose, but then again I was not in the market for Bose. I was in the market for a much less expensive yet quality headphones and I found that in the Cowin E-7. The noise canceling feature is sub-par however, the audio is great and the BT connectivity is excellent. I have yet to drop the connection and wear these all the time. Great value with some noticeable issues that keep it a good price and value.",4,1,2017-4-4,1,0,0
"Failure to maintain bluetooth connection. While it was working the sound was excellent, however it failed to maintain the bluetooth connection while sitting only 10' away and was fully charged. I would like a replacement. Great customer service. I quickly received a replacement that works perfectly and has great sound. The replacement worked for a week then transmission became intermittent as did the previous unit. I am done with this product and would like a refund.",1,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
The long battery life is my favorite thing about this product altho I do wish it had a skip songs button as normally when you double tap it skips forward three times repeats the song instead it simply calls back last person you talked with on the phone,4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
You will be very hard pressed to find a better quality active noise cancelling headphones for this price.  I’ve been wanting to buy these for several years now but always passed.  I finally did and I’m so happy with the purchase.  I went to the store the other day and put on a set of $350 headphones to compare and for  fraction of the cost these are simply amazing.  Just get yourself some if you’ve been on the fence.  You won’t regret it.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I've gone through a number of headphones and for your money this pair is the best by far (sound, connectability, quality)! Additionally they stand by their product as I was sent a replacement after 6 months of use. My son dropped the headphones and fractured the junction at the earpiece. They immediately replaced them no questions asked. This is the third or fourth pair that I have bought as it is my go-to birthday / Christmas present for others. Don't hesitate, just buy them you won't regret it!",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"My first pair had a rushing noise that actually made listening to a movie hard to understand the speech. Customer service is however top notch. They replaced them promptly and the second pair is much better. However still has some muffling of speech and when you activate the noise cancelling that improves, but at the cost of the lower and mid range frequencies.",4,1,2018-8-15,1,0,0
These headphones were excellent until the cheap plastic piece holding the earcups broke after 6 months of very light use.  Very disappointed.,1,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
"These are amazing and Cowin E7 is great! I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities. These are awesome for cutting out daily noise, like city traffic or dogs barking.The sound quality is also amazing. The hears what type of music you're playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job.The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping.So overall, I am very happy with this purchase and don't have any negatives to say about it.",5,1,2018-3-26,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones in August and had a few minor issues.  The seller contacted me about them, and I have to say, their customer service is outstanding.  I have used the headphones and the sound quality is awesome and the noise cancelling works very well.  I also complained that they didn't have a hard case for the headphones and they sent me a gift code to pay for it.  I believe they really went above and beyond to fix the problem and make me a happy and satisfied customer.",5,1,2018-1-2,1,0,0
"Determining value is very personal, many factors come into play. In this instance my criteria was reasonable sound,  some noise canceling ability and a level of material and manufacturing quality.  In my past  travels I’ve misplaced to many pricey headphones, dollar for dollar I can’t see how I’m going to go wrong with these headsets.  The purists may argue but so far I’m pleased with the manufacturer and their product",5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"honestly for the price they are great. the active noise cancelling takes some getting used to. i can 'feel' it in my ears, sort of like sound pressure with no sound. its not noticeable if i play music in them. its great, however, as my busy office gets 30% more quiet at the flip of a switch.note that these do NOT function as non powered headphones. if the battery dies, the headphones will NOT work just hooked up via headphone cable. they MUST be turned on and powered to work.",5,1,2018-2-16,1,0,0
"These are great. Not noise cancelling. There is a noticeable difference between the noise cancelling feature being engaged or not, but you still can clearly hear background noise.But they’re still good headphones, they’re durable, comfortable, hold a charge a really long time, great range, and good sound quality. (I’ve purchased cheaper headphones at target before that had far better noise cancelling. They just weren’t as durable)",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"Alright so I rarely do reviews but these were great for the money so figured I'd do a review. I'm kind of an audiophile, but I wanted a cheap set of over the ear bluetooths for traveling. There are definitely better sounding headphones out there but not in this price bracket. For the average joe, these will make stairway to heaven sound like you're there. For an entry level set of bluetooth headphones these are more than worth the money",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"This has to be the best headphones I got for a while. The battery time is over 20 hours. I use it for taking calls, listening music and watching TV shows. It has superb noise cancelling ability. No problem so far.",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"The noise cancelling feature is very good on these. When I have them on and playing music, I couldn't hear anything my husband was saying when he was right next to me, it looked like he was just mouthing the words! The sound quality is decent; I think you get what you pay for when it comes to sound quality in headphones. Not as good as Bose, but also not nearly as expensive. I think these are a really good option if you want noise cancelling and bluetooth features but can't afford the higher-end headphones on the market. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"Well I finally was able to use these headphones on a plane. 1st of all the sound and bass are great. I wore these for 2 hours watching a movie. WOW they really hurt my ears, Very uncomfortable. Also the unit took forever to connect to Bluetooth on booth my IPad and IPhone.1-3-20: Update. Lexi from customer  relations has resolved my issue and offered me a replacement of another model at no cost and no return. Great customer service",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"I was so excited to purchase the headphones. When they were delivered, I opened the package immediately. They came in a nice packaging which does is not a bonus for me. When I buy products that's an automatic. For the price of the headphones and extreme number of reviews, I expected the headphone material to not feel and look so cheap. These headphones would not have a chance of survival with consistent use. I sent them back immediately.",1,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"Beautiful color! Noise canceling, not noise isolating. I didn’t notice the “hot ears” like other reviews and I wore them working out and laying flooring listening to an audio book. I bought the case to keep them extra safe between uses. I wish the buttons had raised notches to easier feel them / distinguishing them. Still getting the muscle memory down. Overall, I’m pleased with the price and reviews compared to the more marketed brands.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"I didn't expect much with the price, but the headphones totally shocked me!Opening the box, it was an experience. The packaging was beautiful, the company statement made me like them right away, and the sound is great! Works super easily with Bluetooth and cancels noise perfectly. Couldn't hear my cat meowing right behind me - poor guy :)",5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"Not as good at noise cancellation as some Boss that are 3x the price....but that's to be expected, right?  I found these to be comfortable with wonderful sound.  Do they block out all sound?  Nope.  But with music playing, I can't my irritating work neighbors at all!",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"I didn't want to drop a few hundred $$ that I didn't have on noise cancelling headphones for work, so I went looking for something that would do the trick without breaking the bank. These Cowin headphones fit the bill.I had a few people in my office ask me about my headphones when I was using them. After hearing my review, two of them purchased the same headphones. I didn't realize the one had until I went to use my headphones, but heard the music coming out of his pair, because he had left them on while charging them by accident!",4,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"I love everything about these headphones, EXCEPT for the fact that when I use the mic on them, no matter the amount of times I messed with settings, tried on several PCs and game consoles and even smart devices, every time I tested them to talk to people, they said I sounded muffled or at a far distance and couldn't understand me most of the time. Had to go back to the old headphones to use the mic near the mouth. What a bummer cause I really like these, but can't use them due to the mic never working right.",3,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"All the features this product displays are true, so if you are looking for something with long battery life, good wireless capabilities and great sound these are for you. The only Issue I have, as someone who develops software I am wearing these for a solid 8 hours a day. These headphones begin to hurt my ears within an hour or two or usage with is a rather large disappointment due to the product itself being so phenomenal. If you dont plan on long sessions of usage these are 100% the product for you.",3,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
Very pleased with the quality of these headphones. Surprised how much it blocks the noises out. Great sound. Easy to charge and holds the charge a long time. Will be buying a 2nd pair for my husband.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
"This is my first experience with wireless headphones, so wasn't looking to spend a fortune if I wasn't sure I would like them.  These headphones are great--good sound and easy to operate.  For the price, I am very happy with them and would recommend them if you're just dipping your toe into the wireless headphone arena.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"The appearance out of the box was these are a well built set of headphones, not the cheap quality of others that I have used in the past.  Sound quality is very good, the highs, mids, and low are really clear and crisp.  The noise cancelling function works great. Turned the feature on in the office and toned out all the office noise and conversations.  The battery life is outstanding, I used the headphones for about 8 hours total and no need to recharge them yet. This is a big plus.  Where do I start with the comfort, these things just hug your ears like a pillow.  No problem with wearing these for the 8 hours I mentioned earlier.  I would definitely purchase again and I am going to recommend these to anyone in the market for headphones.  These would make a great stocking stuffer for Christmas.",5,1,2017-10-5,1,0,0
i purchased these for my husband as a birthday gift. He loves them. He wore them while cutting the grass.,5,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
Would recommend to anyone with slight hearing problems.  Husband had to have TV so loud to be able to understand what was being said.  With these he can understand words better.  Cuts outside room noise.  He also uses with his computer if he wants to watch videos and I want to watch regular television.  Makes us both happy.,5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
Bought theses for my wife for Christmas. We travel often and noise canceling headphones are a must when flying. Theses stylish & lightweight headphone do a great job of eliminating outside noise and allowing you to hear your podcast or watch a video. Impressed on the battery life too! Solid phones at a fraction of the price of other brands & they’re Bluetooth too!,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
Good pair of headphones for the price. Sound is good and noise cancellation is decent. My one complaint is that the range isn’t that good such as my phone will be in the living room and I’ll be across upstairs and the reach cuts out.,4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"These headphones arrived beautifully packaged and I was able to sync them to my iPad in minutes.  I wear them while working, for a few hours at each stretch, and they're very comfortable on the ears. They do cancel out noise -- even the drilling sounds from the construction site on our street!  The sound quality is very good ... and for the price, I am more than pleased. Thanks for a great product -- I would buy this as a gift for a music lover!",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"I use these headphones at work to help me focus.  I only have to charge them once a week.  Wearing them, the rest of the office disappears; it's been great!  The sound quality is outstanding - I have picked out aspects of songs that were completely undetectable with the ear buds I had been using.  I wish I had picked these up months ago!",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
I love my Cowin E7 headphones!  I love to listen to audiobooks and with two teens and a dog around the house they allow me to hear the book and not the commotion around me.  The sound quality is very good and rich when playing music from my phone.  The headphones attached seamlessly via Bluetooth to my iPhone and we’re ready to go.  Thanks for a great product.,5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,1

"It gets plenty loud, good battery and connectivity. It fell once or twice but works fine. Not something I would recommend for its noise cancellation which does work but doesn't cut out too much noise and other than it is not comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I think the product is great overall.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,1,0
"I can't believe I was able to buy such great headphones without breaking the bank!  These well-construed, durable, comfortable, high quality over-the-ear headphones deliver deep, rich bass while listening to music and absolute peace and quiet if using for sound canceling purposes.  They are easy to charge and just as easy to connect to Bluetooth.  A single charge is long-lasting, too!  I will buy Cowin products again.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"These headphones work quite well and were easy to pair and adjust. I never realized how important headphones might be until I found myself ""safer at home"" for many weeks and realize that headphones enable me to listen to what I want, or to enjoy silence, while my wife can do the same.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"The headphones are super comfortable & I wore them for about 3 hours one night.  I did take them off every now and then but my ears never bothered me.  The sound is really good but this is my first set of headphones.  I haven’t needed to use the noise cancellation.  Like I said very comfortable, the battery is very good, lasts a long time and a very nice sound especially for the price.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
I love these headphones! Ear plugs are uncomfortable but these are light weight and I can make long phone calls and move around the house! Also don’t worry about accidentally hanging up on someone!,5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,1

Bought for my husband to does the daily grind of the walk to and from train stations. He said that the noise cancellation switch works great but he didnt even need to use it as it works fine without it being turned on. He can now ignore others and enjoy his comics and YouTube watching with no interruptions!,5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"i bought these for sensory needs, so my review may not apply if you aren’t in the same boat-very comfortable, long battery life, incredible sound. they are not as noise canceling as i’d like/need, and the NC feature of white noise hurts my ears but i also have SPD so that’s kinda on me; those without sensory issues this is probably a perfect purchase.",4,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones 6 months ago and have used them daily since. They're great for keeping distractions to a minimum while working. I did have an issue with mine and contacted Cowin about it. Within a few hours I got an email saying they would send a replacement as I was still inside the 18 month warranty window. I couldn't believe how quick they responded and resolved the problem. I'm sure there are higher quality headphones out there, but for this price they're an incredible bargain without even factoring in the incredible warranty and customer service. Stop searching for headphones now and just get these. You won't be disappointed.",5,1,2018-1-3,1,0,0

This is my second set of Cowin E7s and they are the perfect headphone at this price point. Sound quality is great as is bass and so is the noise cancelling feature. The over the ear padding is comfortable and the battery life is incredible. My first set lasted about 4ish years and I used them almost daily for a few hours at a time. I recommend these headphones to almost everyone I know.,5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"I bought the headphones back in 2016, I think. Still have the same pair, still work great. I bought them because I worked for vineyard at the time and  that required a lot of tractor time. These were able to cancel out the background hum of the mower,  sprayer,  or harvester. They were perfect for pruning season when I didn't want to fear accidentally cutting my wire with shears. Absolutely recommend!",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"These are a great set of headphones for the price. I use them mostly while sitting at my desk or while running and they work great in both settings.

"Great buy for the price, particularly for those of us not willing to pay $2-300 for noise cancelling headphones.  Pairing is easy. Sound quality is good to excellent. Noise cancellation very good - even excellent for the price. My only slight complaint is that the spring on the headphones is a bit too tight and strong for a fathead like me so I have to take a break every 30 minutes or so to ease the pressure - it would be wonderful were there some kind of tension adjustment.",4,1,2017-6-18,1,0,0
"I bought these so I could watch movies on my phone during lunch and not annoy people around me. A bit fiddly to get paired, but once you do it all go and no stopping! Sound is great. Deep and rich. Long play times - haven't had it run down on me yet. Really wish I had a pair of these when I was travelling to Japan, would have been really cool to noise cancel on the plane while listening to the latest Avengers movie.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0

"I got these for the AptX sound, the ability to connect Bluetooth via NFC, and the excellent battery life. Noise cancelling is better than expected. Comfort is good- still haven't worn for more than an hour at a time though. I am looking forward to wearing these on my riding mower in the summer. My only 'wish' for improving would be that they could shrink the size down a bit and make the ear cup openings a little wider.",4,1,2019-3-11,1,1,0

"The Cowin E7 headphones are great for jamming out while working from home. Unfortunately, I was hoping these headphones would also serve as a way to chat privately on videoconferencing platforms. Turns out the mic is not all that great and sounds ""muffled"" on other peoples end. If I am willing to shout they can hear me well, but that defeats the point of trying to have a private conversation to begin with. Overall, good product for the price range, but if you are looking to use these as a substitute for earbuds or a headset with a mic, you might want to consider an alternative.",4,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
This pair of headphones is great. I have used them around the house. I have use them on planes. They are will be built. They sound good.

I used this on my 7.5 and 8.5 hour flight recently and they were perfect. I have a decent sized head and they never felt tight and fit comfortably over my ears.

I splurged a little bit and paid more than I normally would for headphones. These headphones are worth the money as the sound is great and the bass is amazing my only greip is the battery life is a little lower than what they say it's like 10-12 hours not more than that.,5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0

Decent headphones, disappointed that they only lasted a year.Update: Upgraded review to 5 stars. I contacted the seller and sent them pics of product and told about it.

I use these to watch TV.  I'm not an audiophile but they work well for me.  Battery lasts a long time.  No humming or hissing and blocks external noises well.  They're very comfortable too.  I actually like them better than the RF connecting Sennheisers I used to use.,5,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0

"These headphones were my absolute favorite thing when I purchased them, but after a couple months of having them and using them in a normal manner almost everyday they crapped out on me. One day they would not turn on to the Bluetooth setting or the Active Noise Cancellation setting even though they were fully charged. I plugged them in to charge just to make sure it wasn't the battery and then everything was working fine ONLY while they were plugged into the charger. Once I unplugged them, they went back to not turning on whatsoever. I'm not exactly sure what to do seeing that I believe they are the newest version in which I cannot take the battery out and hard reset it. I feel crushed because these were my favorite headphones I've ever bought. Buyer Beware.",2,1,2017-9-7,1,2,0

My experience with over the ear headphones has been pretty disappointing - UNTIL I FOUND COWIN E7!They quality seems pretty great (I've had them for about a week), sound and noise cancellation is excellent AND after wearing them for more than 2 hours I DO NOT get a headache, because they're not HEAVY AT-ALL.

Normal BT mode is quite boomy for my taste. I use the NC mode and it's much better. For my purposes I would buy them again, but if it were to listen just to music I would go with Bose or a higher end Sennheiser.",4,1,2018-5-10,1,1,0

I'm disappointed.",1,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"First use I was blown away with the sound quality. Bass is satisfying, I would the E-7 has more bass then my Beats Solo².  The build of the headphones are pretty durable. The look is a bit retro, but I love the look anyway. ANC is perfect for me when studying in classes and also just doing homework in general. This is definitely a keeper.

"Bought these just before a trip to LA, mostly for the noise-cancelling feature and price point. I am very impressed with these. They are a lot more comfortable than I expected and the sound quality is great.

I've used some Beats before and was unimpressed, these are actually better quality in my opinion.",5,1,2017-7-4,1,1,0

Sound quality, bass and treble is very good. For now, I'm loving these!",5,1,2017-8-7,1,0,0
"These headphones are really comfy and great for the price.  They are great  for running and long hour wear without crushing your ears.  However, they are not noise cancelling as you can still hear other people talking if you are sitting in a library or cafe.  Also, people sitting around you can hear the music if the music is loud enough.",4,1,2019-9-18,1,1,0
Really use these during workouts and they are terrific and comfortable. The quality of the music is great. Noise cancellation also works well. Price was definitely great and I wish I had these a long time back.,5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
Personally for the price I don't think you can get much better.  These are extremely comfortable and block out every noise I've tested.  They are very easy to operate and fit to your head correctly.  The battery life of the headphones says 9 hours but I've gotten up to 12 out of it most times.The only warning I do have is if you work in an office environment... check your volume... because it doesn't block the noise the other way :)  You can have it at very low volume and have it block noise out though so it works out well!,5,1,2017-9-13,1,0,0

Got these for work because they are doing construction next door.  Been using them for a couple of weeks now and they're working great.

When listening to music over the BlueTooth connect the bass clear and deep.  The high end is crisp and clear.  I was impressed with the construction of these headsets,  looks like they will last a long time. Each ear piece has 2 mount points which is stronger than the one mount point and should hold up better than my old set.  Overall good value in this price range.",4,1,2018-3-25,1,0,0

"I had high hopes for these, especially considering the price. I've never had noise cancelling headphones before, so I was open to the experience of what it might be. My reasoning for getting these is that I work in your typical Corporate America Cube Farm. You know what that means: loud talking co-workers and coworkers who annoyingly: clip their nails as if this is a nail salon, cough every 5-10 seconds, disgustingly clear their sinuses/throat/chest/whatever every 25 minutes, sniff back up whatever snot they have in their nose, laugh... hard...and wildly (you know you know someone). I cannot concentrate. While the music I had playing was of perfect sound, it did not, however, drown out these noises that set my teeth on edge. Lastly, and this is my own boneheaded non-thinking self, if you wear eyeglasses, OBVIOUSLY, having over the ear headphones is going to make the sides of your glasses push into your head. We're no longer newborns and have soft, impressionable heads... we're hardheaded adults. Literally. So, sadly, I will return these and continue my research of perhaps in-the-ear active noise cancelling headphones. Can't justify purchasing the Bose or B&O... but, if I end up in the news for strangling my coworker who clears out his throat/hocks loogies  (sp? spit?) every single retched day... maybe it would be best that I do shell out the $300.",2,1,2018-5-24,1,4,0

He did use my set for 1 hr.,5,1,2018-3-23,1,0,0
The control buttons could use a raised button to help locate up/down controls. The noise canceling is poor. I had a pair of E8 headphones first but the charge plug broke off inside the ear phones.

I contacted customer service and within 12 hours of my email, I was provided with a response and the means to receive a replacement pair of headphones. Cowin was very understanding and helped remedy the situation quickly. These are definitely worth the cost and are backed by superior customer service.",5,1,2018-8-4,1,0,0
"I bought these to use for work.  I don't know if I just had a dysfunctional device or the mic is really that bad, but it was so terrible that I to return this item.  Everyone on my conference calls was constantly saying I sounded 'under water' or similar.  Such a bummer because the sound quality is nice.",2,1,2020-7-3,1,1,0
These head phones are perfect. Comfortable easy to use and they paired with my new Samsung 65KS 800D in seconds. No latency which is what I've had problems with in the past obviously Bluetooth has gotten much better. These work and look great. I highly recommend them to anyone that has a newer TV that does not have and audio plug for headphones or if you just don't want to deal with the cords and mess.,5,1,2017-5-3,1,2,0
"I'm getting used to being in a shared workspace where impromptu meetings tend to happen a few yards away from my desk. These have saved my focus and productivity, just shutting the rest of the world out. The noise-cancelling feature feels a little like being on an airplane (if that makes sense?) but I find that low- to medium- volume music shuts out sound just fine. Love that I can just keep the music on my phone going and leave these on even as I walk around the office.",5,1,2017-9-13,1,0,0
I use these for college and they are wonderful! They help me concentrate by canceling a lot of noise with the additive of some music. My toddler is LOUD and CRAZY. These are a godsend. I don't know where I would be without them. Thank you Cowin!,5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace my broken Beats so I knew that they would not be as awesome. But the sound is actually comparable. The disappointing part is that they have a literal on/off switch instead of a button, so they don't turn themselves off when you fall asleep or set them down. It's surprising how annoying that is. The battery wastes away as you snooze.",4,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"I have been looking for some decent price noise-canceling headphones for some time.  I decided to buy these ones based on the reviews, and they did not disappoint!  Being a commuter on the metro in DC, I like to be in my own little world while listening to music or books, and these did the trick.  I would say having the volume button for up and down would be better off switched, but that's okay.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"The first E7 I purchased broke at the spot between the muffs and the band. I told Cowin about it. Within a week, I had a new E7!

The sound is wonderful and the color is great!",5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"When they worked, they were great. I bought these for my daughter in December. They are not even 3 months old and the right ear no longer has sound. Not worth the price for the length of time they worked.",2,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0
"This is definitely not a 200/300$ sony headphones, but it gets the job done. It does reduce the noise levels by quiet a bit. There is a noticeable difference with noise cancellation turned on, however I tried to compare it with the expensive sony headphones my friend had and that was much better at noise cancellation.But at almost a fraction of the price of sony headphones, I highly recommend this if you are looking for the best value for money paid.",5,1,2019-5-4,1,0,0
"I've had a few pairs of noise cancelling headphones, I had a pair of bose at one point, for commercial planes this is awesome they work really well to cancel the noise but on militsry air craft they are alright not fantastic just alright. As far as aesthetics they look cheap and feel cheap they feel flimsy so I bought a case for them to hold up in my bag,I wouldn't travel with these alone in your bag. They fit me perfectly but I feel someone with a larger head may have difficulty they seem on the small side.",4,1,2017-1-27,1,0,0
"Firstly, if you're after headphones with crisp, high quality audio without dropping $150+ these are the ones.As soon as my headphones came in (fully charged out of the box) I put them on, easily connected them to my IPhone 5 (which conveniently displays the headphones' battery life) and started listening. The 'BT' switch offers great quality sound without completely deafening others around you. The 'NC' switch (noise cancelling) creates an atmosphere inside the headphones completely removing all outside sounds, especially piercing bass; however, the NC option may not be best for runners because when the phones bounce on your head the 'atmosphere' is interrupted and creates rough audio.",5,1,2016-8-15,1,0,0
"I love these headphones. They are very comfortable to wear. I think the sound quality is great and the noise reduction works very well. I think that the max volume could be higher but for me it works. Battery life seems very good I get all the use out of them that I want before I have to charge them. The only down side to me is sometimes the off/bt/noise reduction switch goes between the settings, maybe a more durable switch could have been used here.  Overall I think this is a great product and I would purchase other headsets from Cowin in the future",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
Sound quality was fine but I had to return these due to being unable to adjust the Microphone sensitivity.  It would pick up a dog barking a mile away and when listening to the mic it sounded like I was at the bottom of Niagara Falls.

"I purchased these headphones after realizing that I'll be working from home for a while due to COVID. I love that feeling, I love that their WIRELESS and I can walk around the house, craft, cook and get the mail and not break sound.

"VERY IMPORTANT:  These headphones are not active noise canceling!!!  I bought them based on the positive reviews, even double checking them with fakespot.com which gave these an A rating.  When I received them, I was suspicious, since there wasn't any mention of noise canceling on them, nor any setting for it.  I tried them within a home setting and they work OK, but while on a recent flight, there was no noise canceling at all!  I should have checked the Cowin website, which clearly shows they are not noise canceling.  Otherwise, not a bad set of 'phones, though the finish does pick up every fingerprint possible.",2,1,2018-2-4,1,1,0

"I bought the Cowin E7 headphones for 2 main reasons: 1. For long airplane travels 2. for improved sound quality in Zoom meetings. I am very satisfied with the noice cancelling technology which makes airplane travels much less annoying. Using my previous headphones I couldn't make what my teacher was telling during the Zoom conferences. The Cowin E7 headphones made it really easy for me to understand, as the sound quality is much better. Listening to music is also very good with deep bass and accurate prima for this price range.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0

"For the price of these suckers, I am beyond satisfied. The noise canceling works wonders and the sound quality isn't sacrificed much. I didn't want to pay $300 for ""that other known brand"" and I wanted something I could use daily but keep some money in the bank.  These are great.  Very comfortable on the ears and head. Lightweight and durable.  Again, if I wanted a pair of $300 headphones, I would have spent that much. These are very affordable and well worth it.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

"The headphones paired immediately with my iPhone 7 Plus and the sound quality rivals my Bose earbuds that were over twice the cost. The noise cancelling drowned out everything but my own voice when I sang along loudly.

I'm glad I did my research and didn't pay $200+ dollars on headphones. The sound quality on these is phenomenal. Cant say how long the battery lasts but they were used through a full 9 hour road trip and did not die. They fit great over the ears and are very comfy.

"Does a really good job at reducing the plane noise (I got it for this) while still allowing most normal conversation to be understood. It does tend to generate some popping noise during landing, but I found if I keep my head off the seat back, it does not happen. The only surprise in the month of ownership is when it spontaneously connected (15 minutes into the flight) to blue tooth of the person next to me playing music. It has only happened once, so I think it was just a fluke.",4,1,2018-3-27,1,0,0

"I'm giving this five stars not because it's perfect but because its value so significantly exceeds its price.Also, the imperfection is slight: Noise cancellation does not work when you have a wired cable plugged in.  I use it wired almost all the time (mixers don't usually have BT headset support) but I think I'm in the minority there.  I'm not sure I'd recommend these to mix music.

The headphones sound ok. They don't sound like a $200 pair but sound is decent where you dont really hear the speakers rattle. If you put them on and someone next to you yells you can barely hear them so they cancel noise pretty good. They look good but feel a bit cheap. For example the volume button feels bit loose.

"These headphones are by far my favorite to use. I’m not an expert on headphones but I can definitely say the battery life is out of this world. It’s not too loud and the jump from mute to quietest is acceptable. Bass sounds great but not overpowering, and the little carrying case is perfect.

Honestly it is a solid 4 star product. It does everything well but not amazing. The sound cancelling does mute the environment to some degree but it is definitely not sound proof.

I bought a brand name headphone in 2014 (I exclude the name to preserve the legitimacy of my review) for a comparable price. The headphones I purchased in 2014 are leagues above the sound quality COWIN provides. There is no depth to music and the noise canceling is negligible.

"I love these headphones. They are comfortable. I have a lot of earrings and most headphones are so uncomfortable, but not these ones. I can wear them for hours. The noise cancellation is fantastic. I can listen to my music and they drown out all the excess noise.

The bestThing to know about these headphones is that Cowin Stands Behind its products. The base is amazing and the highs are perfect. However I had a problem with my microphone for talking through your headphones taking a call. Cowin Immediately replaced the headphones and not only did they just replace them there they upgraded me to the E7 pro headphones free of charge! Great customer service staff and the product speaks for itself. A+,5,1,2019-5-23,1,1,0
"The sound and noise cancelling worked very well.  However, if you are looking for microphone usage look elsewhere as the micropohone on this is very poor.

"I was pleasantly surprised by the build quality of these headphones, and I really think they represent a solid value for the non-audiophile like myself whom simply wanted some wireless, noise cancellation with comfort and acceptable audio quality. I daily live with tinnitus, a shrill ringing in my consciousness (20 years of firing weapons in the army tends to leave that effect on the auditory senses), so I doubt that I could recognise subtle acoustic distinctions like a demanding sophisticate does (or claims to). Mega-Buck stereophile grade gear would just be wasted on me. I have no doubt that Bose headphones costing 3 times more would offer the average consumer a superior listening experience, but to my tattered ear canals, I am happy as hell! Considering the amount of stainless steel? and high quality vinyl or bonded leather is used in the design, and how long the batteries last (I'd guess 15 hours +), I have to concur with another reviewer, whom felt 'guilty' as if they had stolen these. Unless the expensive looking finish suddenly starts peeling off, or the cushioned vinyl/leather disentigrates in the near future...I will have to continue resisting the impulse to hang my head in shame for 'ripping off' the seller.",5,1,2016-9-6,1,0,0
These headphones look cool but the sound quality is sub par at best. Audio Technicas or Toatronics in the same price range sound waaay better. Probably won't buy cowin again. Highs and mids are saturated. Definitely not crisp. Bummer,3,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0

The sound quality and noise cancellation capabilities of the Cowin E7 are excellent at its price point.  But perhaps the best attribute is the battery life.

"The headphones are definitely living up to its price by far. Very comfortable, good sound, amazing battery time and the noice reduction is also solid (used them for a transatlantic flight and it was wonderful). Of course it might not match up in sound quality with the 200 or 300 dollar options, but as a frequent buyer of 50-100 dollar headphones, these are the best one I have bought by far. Only criticism about the product that I can think of is the microphone, but that is not the point of these headphones anyway.Furthermore, Cowin offers fantastic customer service.

I have not tested the battery life yet so don't know how long I can use them before they die but they don't take long to charge.  The only drawback is that they don't really cancel out the noise as much as I would like.  I use them while studying in a public space and can hear the folks talking around me pretty well although it's good enough so that I'm not as easily distracted.

"Earphones work great.  They cancel out the Jet noise as well as the JVC but are better then the Bose $349.00 headsets.  Another advantages over the Bose are they work as standard head phones  without using the noise canceling feature if desired, That alone reserves battery power and avoids the need to keep replacing batteries.  Bose forces you to consume battery power whether or not the noise cancelling feature is needed.

I have had a Sony MDR-NC60 noise canceling headset for a few years until the cheap plastic rotating swivel that holds the earpiece broke making them useless. I bought the Cowin E-7 because of its features and low price. It has all the features I want and a strong rotating earpiece structure. I just returned from a flight on a twin prop regional aircraft where I sat right next to the propeller. The sound deadening was so effective that I hardly noticed the noise.The earpieces are a little thick but I found that this helped eliminate the talking in the waiting room allowing me to read undisturbed even without the sound deadening turned on.

"Sound quality is good. Noise cancelation is fine, but not great. Only got 8 months of daily use (wear at a desk job) from them though. They have a structural design flaw at the pivot points of the speakers. Both pivot points broke within a month of each other.",3,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"Best headones for the money that I’ve ever bought. The noise canceling is alright on its own but with music people have to wave to get my attention. Lasting battery power!

"For under $70 you really can't beat the quality of the product.  The sound and comfort is really good.  There is some distortion when volume is at higher levels but overall you can't expect bose quality sound at this price point.  The noise cancellation does a pretty good job too.  I wore these when mowing the lawn and was able to enjoy my music at reasonable volume.  They actually work really well in phone calls as well, people on the other end couldn't tell I was using a bluetooth headset.  It is a little weird when you are talking because of the fact that you are wearing noise cancelling headphones because your own voice is muffled.  Volume and track controls on the right earcup work well but the button feel could be improved.",4,1,2017-6-25,1,0,0
"They are absolutely amazing. Very reliable battery life over the past few weeks since I've used them. Chose it for my wife and she loved the red color. Really worth the additional money over other leading headphones in terms of quality of headphones as well as the superb sound quality.Also, it was my first experience for Noise cancellation. It's just out of the world, if you are using it for the first time.",5,1,2019-6-9,1,0,0
"With Bluetooth headphones running the prices they do, it's nice to see a reasonably priced set that has decent sound (mids are a bit weak, and the bass can be a little mushy). Good for most uses. Audiophiles will be disappointed, but for those of us with normal ears, it's a peach for the price. Good battery life, and deceptively comfortable. I sit wearing these for hours. While they get a little warm and sweaty at times, the fit is firm but not tight.",4,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
I read the reviews before purchasing like I always do.  Based on them I said why not? These are very low budget in my opinion. I have a pair that I bought at Kmart that way surpass these things.

"Loved noice cancelling feature, very high quality. Only real negatives is the headphones can only be paired to one device at a time, not connected but paired. Meaning to connect to a different device you have to reset Bluetooth settings on headphones and forget headphones from other devices. Also for whatever reason when I first connect to laptop, sound quality is quite poor. But that clears up within a couple min",4,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"This is a quality head set . The sound is very good. The packaging is top notch. Only one thing I would change ,the off ,BT and Nc switch. If you push the switch the wrong way you can leave your head set on for days and run down the battery. There needs to be a permanent marking for the OFF position. The print is very hard to read without a flashlight or bright light.",5,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0
"Comfortable, almost great sound quality, decent Bluetooth range.Biggest downside? The microphone. It's bad. Audio / videoconferences are nearly impossible with this microphone.

I purchased these headphones to use while I was traveling for work. The sound quality is excellent. I could hear distinct sounds without them being muffled or other noises bleeding in.

The bass is boosted, but it becomes irritable quickly. it also randomly will wobble which hurts the brain. It does this whether or not you are listening to anything.

I really feel these are a steal! You could pay a lot more for noise cancelling headphones but I only need something to help me focus from timeTo time.  The sound is good and the red ones look nice.

Very bad headphone. The sound quality not good at all and it have lag latency when connected via bluetooth. Its size so large with no horse power in it.

"The cowen E7 headphones are so useful if you are in a car or on the plane. The noice cancelling feature is great so you can't hear other people talking in busy areas ex(plane, subway, car). All in all a great pair of headphones for a low price. Totally recommend to buy it again. Downside is when you go into the noise cancelling feature the sound of the music you listen to goes slightly quieter. Still recommend for daily use.",5,1,2018-8-24,1,1,0

"For a ~$50 pair of headphones, these are pretty great. Noise cancellation is not as good as a Bose Quiet Comfort but it’s certainly better than nothing and sound quality itself is pretty good. The reason it isn’t great is because the BASS on these headphones is so wide that it swallows up the rest of the soundstage from time to time. These headphones also have a tendency to frequency modulate at high volume, but almost all headphones do this.Overall, very happy with the purchase.",5,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0

I use it mainly as Bluetooth but the wire is long so when I use it I don’t have to be close to my computer or phone to use it.

I did quite a bit of research for over ear headphones and Cowin showed up a lot. I wasn't familiar with the brand but thought I'd give them a try. They've been great. I love the freedom of wireless.

Even with my large ears they still fit on quite nice, but will start to feel warm after a bit of listening.  I only had one con and that was the noise bleed on the outside.  I noticed that wearing the headphones It was pretty well at noise canceling, except for it doesn’t do so well on the outside where others around you could somewhat hear whats playing on the headphones.  Aside from that the headphones are nice 👌",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,1

I like the way they cover your ear and the sound quality is good. When put on NC or noise cancelling they lose something in sound quality and the sound gets lower. So I never use nc. I use them to cut the grass and variety of sound uses.,4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0

"I like the easy setup and clarity of sound. The noise cancelling is excellent especially on airplane travel and public transit. However, I did knock a few points down due to a couple of things. I found the noise cancelling to work a little too well to the point where it affects the bass quality and dialogue/lyrics clarity. Second, the mic ended up sounding rather static upon listening and I would have to switch to my earbuds to talk to people. I’m talking with Cowin to see if they have some fixes on that issue. Other than that, it’s a good pick for the price!",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,1

The NC does a poor job at blocking out normal noise but does a below average job at blocking higher pitched sounds. The build quality is atrociously cheap, cheaper than I had expected.

I used them on my last flight to drowned out the airplane noise with no problems.  The constant jostling around on the head makes it impossible to utilize the noise canceling feature while running.  Very loud feedback results.  The headphones are comfortable, but fit very loosely.  I use them in the gym while exercising upright, but on chest days when I'm laying down on the bench they will fall off of my head.  Again no issues with this while running, but will NOT stay on head while reclined.

One worked great except the Blue Tooth connectivity stopped and I had to use a cable to connect. Another one just stopped working after a year. Another one didn’t block out background noise at all.  And finally, with another one, my sound source would disconnect periodically during playback.  The Corwin E7 is awesome AND reliable AND solves ALL of my needs!

Great headphones! I have had a great  experience with them for the past couple of months. I have been complimented many times about my headphones. They sound really amazing and their price very well. The only critique I will say is what the noise cancelling sounds like when you move around too much they have a type of whooshing sound I'm not really a fan of.

I give this product for stores from a verified and satisfied buyer.,1,1,2017-5-8,1,0,0

I have owned and tried different noise cancelling headphones on the market and when i compare these headphones to them they are dead last. Also i am not sure if this is a problem on all the headphones but the ones i received had a constant lingering static electrical noise in the left ear. I have since returned them and will not try from this company again.,1,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0

I have owned these for a while so I can honestly say that if you are looking for great sound quality that brings the bass these are the headphones for you. Gave had no troubles with theses and I work out 4 to 5 times a week. Cheaper than the overpriced Beats brand but provides similar listening experience. If you want to save some money but still get great headphones these are one of the better options.,5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"No dislikes at all. Great battery life. I sometimes  have to remember to charge it. Sound quality is very good with a solid definitive bass. Bluetooth performs perfect with a solid connection. Was hesitant when ordering since I was not familiar with brand. After trying the set out, I was very impressed. No disappointment. They did not skimp on packaging either. Easily runs and performs on the same tracks as the standard major electronic brands, Sony, Bose, etc. Even better value when you catch them on sale.",5,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0

This is a great headset and the best part is fits over hearing aids comfortably. I would have given 5 stars. I have given 4 stars because I had to buy extra extend cords because whe I plug I to computer I cannot wear - very short headset and usb cords. It’s an improvement point for this headset. Otherwise very nice headset and Bluetooth as well.,4,1,2018-2-10,1,0,0
For the money these are hard to beat and maybe can't be beat. They are the most comfortable headphones that I have ever wore along with being a really good looking product.

"the earpads are beginning to disintegrate. The right ear pod has snapped off its gimble and used plastic tape (it's flexible) to reattach - no problems.

"I especially like the quality of sound and comfort.  I had purchased a earbud system that failed on both those accounts, which I had to send back.  With the over the ear system it is much better.  The reason I gave it a four star on the material quality was because of the plastic construction, but I have had the E7 for a while and the construction seems to be holding up well.  The cost was another factor--for the price you can't beat the E7.  You can spend hundreds of dollars more for earphones, but the E7 works just fine.!",5,1,2018-12-24,1,0,0

I even loved the presentation of the headphones in the box it came in. It was packed especially smart. The phones look great and fit so comfortably.

"First, they are very attractive, look well made and are comfortable for the short time I wore them.  The sound quality is superb, particularly without the noise cancellation on.  There is no issue with the BT headphones connecting immediately to my device.  I only wish the noise cancellation was greater but it is still very good. I've only had this several  days, but so far pleased.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0

"I'm re-writing this after further testing.  They are very reliable, don't take long to charge, and last through a full day of work.  I'm lucky.  I work for myself, so I can wear headphones whenever I like at work.  These fit the bill, as I'm a Finish Woodworker, and the tools I use, are very very loud as you can imagine.

I've worn on a train, air plane, and at work and it is great. The sound quality is great. Only part that it lack just a bit is the bass, that say a beats would have. It is also a bit bulkier than expect. The look is great. My biggest downfall of the product is that i wish it folded up, and was a bit more compact for storage. You also have to buy hard case for it separately. otherwise I 100% recommend!",4,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0
"I really like these headphones. I am on a lot of zoom calls for work and these make it so much easier to focus on the meetings and not my children running around me all day.

"The sound quality is stellar, and the deep bass is definitely as-advertised. I am a little miffed at A) the sound quality really drops off when using in noise cancelling mode and B) noise cancelling mode doesn't seem to do much.

"Edit:The company contacted me unsolicited based on my review notifying me they have sent a new pair. I originally gave it a one star (left the original post below). They sent a second pair. This pair the noise canceling feature works. I've updated my review to three stars based on customer service and the ANC working on the new set. The blue tooth inconsistently pairs so I still hard wire the new unit and the switch set up is still ""off, blue tooth and ANC""single selections. Also, the volume control on the new unit still doesn't adjust the volume, so those aren't really fixed. The ANC works ok, though, so I'm updating the review but would still only give it a 3. For the price I would say eh, they're okay based on the new pair. I've noticed now with using them a while that although comfortable, if you need to wear for a long period (hours), they do make my ear lobes sore.",3,1,2017-7-3,1,4,0

Bought this when they had a 30% promo and the ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) is GREAT. I've tested this on 2 flights being a regular flight commuter - The musi quality is good in my opinion but this is of course subjective however there is no dispute on the ANC component while the design of it's buttons are great.The only thing from keeping it from a 5 star is the blue LED which my partner commented on as rather glaring (in a dark room) which doesn't effect me but I do agree that the it could be a bit more discreet if it was placed somewhere less conspicuous.,4,1,2017-7-1,1,1,0
Nice!  I have several different headsets similar to this set and this E7 does have the best base of any that I've used.  The mid-range is a bit weak in both settings (reg. and noise canceling).

The headset rests comfortably for hours too even though it has a nice weighty, solid construction. The noise cancelling feature enhances the audio.

I absolutely love these headphones. I was playing a game for months and after switching to these I heard new sounds I’d never knew were in the game. Couldn’t recommend higher.,5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
Easy to use and connect,5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"I like how easy these were to pair with my phone and watch. They have a great sound, and I really like the noise cancelling feature. They are a great quality for the price.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
First Pair—Bad connection between the two headphones so the left speaker is scratchy if you move at all or the cord gets touched - making them unusable.  Has them about 60 days and only recharged them twice so less than 60 hours total listening time.  Doesn't work much better with Bluetooth.  Good product otherwise.  I must have gotten a bad set.Update—seller sent a second pair of headphones and they work as expected.  Good sound quality a decent noise reduction.  Changed rating to 4****,4,1,2018-3-11,1,1,0
"I used these products during the work week for about 4-5 hours a day for about a year and they were good while they lasted. They're comfortable, the sound quality is good, noise cancellation could be better but still decent, but unfortunately the quality of the materials could be better as they broke after a year of use. The piece of plastic holding the ear cup onto the headband broke.",3,1,2020-8-6,1,0,1
Really weak on the high end and flat and muddy base.  Sounds like a 1940s cabinet consol.,2,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0
"I'm working from home, as are most folks that can, right now.  My elderly father lives with me, and I bought these so he could continue about his daily routine without me being distracted by it.  I can hear him clear as day, walking around the house, fixing a meal etc.  One other reviewer said these muffled lawn mowers etc.  Not my experience. yes, I read the instructions and have it set to 'NC' for noice cancelling.  I'm returning these.",1,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"These headphones are great!  The sound is clear and crisp, the bass pounds and best of all, when I'm wearing them, I'm fully immersed in my music/podcast. My family has to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention, I can't hear them at all. Highly recommend, they're comparable to my husband's Skull Candy Crusher ANC, but at a greater value.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"The sound quality isn't great, but it works as a bluetooth headset. They are not comfortable for listening for extended periods of time with glasses on, but I don't think that is necessarily these specific headphones fault. The active noise cancelling is okay, but it doesn't work super well. I normally just use it in the bluetooth setting because the headphones themselves do a good enough job canceling noise.",4,1,2017-12-13,1,1,0
"This is a great set of headphones.  They are wireless and easy to hook up to your tv via bluetooth.  They definitely are comfortable wearing even for long periods of time!  I have only had them for about 2 months and use them a lot.  They are easy to charge, (use the cable for your Android phone charger), and hold a charge for a long time!  If you are looking for a great set of headphones that will not break your budget, I highly recommend these Cowin E7 headphones.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
I don’t do gaming but for all other headphone uses especially since I previously had to use just my hearing aids.  Great quality and durability at a much lower cost than the expensive options.,5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"I like these headphones and their sound quality is great but it took me a while to learn how to use them.  Therefore, if you don't understand Bluetooth, these headphones are not for you.",4,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"What's not to like, low price, easy to use, long charge hold, and it's one of the beat headphones I have purchased in years. I'm not kidding when I say that I'm going to buy a second set before Cowin gets wise and raised the price.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"Product works great. I love that there is still the option to use wired if needed. In my recording situation, I needed to connect with wires to my microphone and it is helpful to have that option. I wish the cord was longer, but I can easily get another cord. Just a slight adjustment to consider if you are like me and needing to have your headphones wired.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,1
The headphones the first 6 months broke but I contacted the company and they gave me a new pair. One bad thing is that the charging cord is only about a foot long.,4,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"I have now ordered these headphones twice because I loved the sound quality, but through unfortunate trial and error I've discovered that these headphones WILL, regardless of how you take care of them, break within a year. The insurance is a WASTE OF MONEY as it is RIDICULOUSLY difficult trying to get in contact with them or file a claim online, and they NEVER got back in contact with me. I advise that everyone invest in a sturdier, higher-quality pair of headphones.",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"The sound quality is FANTASTIC!! I get tired of constantly putting my earplugs back in when I am working out, doing yardwork, etc. These fit well and are very comfortable. Set up was easy!!",5,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0
"Not happy with the noise canceling feature, quality of the sound, quality of product.",2,1,2019-3-21,1,2,0
"Updating my review because while at first I was unhappy with the headphones (significant sound leakage), I was surprised to have customer service follow up. They apologized and said that shouldn’t happen so I have a new pair just received that works flawlessly (best of all, no sound leakage) blocks out noise excellently. I am very happy with these so I would say because of the customer service wiling to remediate any issues, and the new product being great, this is a great choice",5,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0
I was surprised at how easy these headphones were to connect with Bluetooth.I use them at work to cancel out the noise and listen to music or news.,5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
I have a severe hearing disability and I often attend the theatre.  I recently purchased the Cowin E7 for the sole purpose of using the compatible audio system that my favorite theatre uses.  Used them just last night and WOW!  I heard every word both spoken and sung (it was a musical).  I can't say enough good things about this product.  The added bonus:  it connects to my iPhone and my TV!,5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
Speakers sound great. Noise cancelling in the headphones works great. Microphone on the other hand picks up everything around you. Even your foot steps. Makes it extremely annoying to anyone your on the phone with. Ear cups after 4 months of use,3,1,2019-8-10,1,0,1
"I use these headphones while working around the house and exercising.  They are a little bass heavy, which is an audio thing that I do not mind at all, but some people may not like.  Otherwise they sound great for music and movies.  I do like the build of the headphones and the battery life and bluetooth connection works great.  I really think for the price point they are a great pair of bluetooth headphones.",4,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"I love it! I wear it to exercise, on walks, work commutes, studying, and it has been absolutely amazing. Great sound cancellation, hasn't flaked, great sound quality. I do wish that I could fold the headphones to fit into my full backpack but that is my only complaint. Would totally recommend.",5,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
"Bought a pair for my middle school daughter who wanted a pair of over ear Bluetooth headphones for Christmas. The battery life is great and they have held up extremely well - which if you know middle school girls, is amazing in itself. She wears them every day while working on her homework. This makes my life better as well: no more listening to the same pop song for the 25th time in a row.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"I bought these as Christmas gift for son.  He didn't tell me that they malfunctioned and stopped working after three weeks back at college.  I found them in his room when he went back to school this Fall.  If I would have known, I would have demanded a replacement.  I feel I deserve one!  It's not too late!!AMAZON - ANYONE LISTENING OUT THERE?!!!!!!",1,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"Really easy to set-up and link to TV and Phone.  Excellent for late night TV when wife is sleeping.  Also with many actives and home repair during the day, sound is locked out so you can hear your sound on movies clearly.",5,1,2019-3-16,1,0,0
"Not as good noise cancellation as I was expecting. Weight is good, pads are comfortable and they look nice. ANC does ok but I don’t like giving up the battery. Overall, a good headphone, just not great.",4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I got these for my daughter who is living at home and going to College.  They work great. She is able to play quite music in the background while she studies and does not hear the other noises from the house. That was the whole point in buying them.  In addition to great function, they look stylish and when she is using them to listen to music, the sound quality is excellent.",5,1,2017-10-27,1,0,0
"I use these in my office, which is an open office environment. The wraparound foam on the ears is isolating enough that I rarely needed to use the noise cancelling function. After a year of daily work week use, the right side connection has started to come apart -- the earpiece is almost entirely detached from the headband. It's a bummer because I've really liked these headphones. For the price, I'd say they are worth a year of use, but now I think I'll try to find a more solidly built set.",3,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
"I got these headphones when our building was having a lot of repair work done; I work from home, and couldn't stand the noise level. The headphones muted the noise considerably, making it possible to concentrate on my work. I do find them a little heavy, but well worth it, and a really good price compared to others on the market.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
