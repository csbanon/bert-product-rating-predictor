"Super simple to setup and easy to use. I was up and running in less than 15 minutes. The app is easy to use and the instructions are very simple. It's essentially 4 steps.1) Stick sensor on garage door. I was worried this would be a two-part sensor like the little lasers at the bottom that detect if someone walks through the beam while it's closing. It's not. It's a small puck, about half the size of a deck of cards, that sticks on your door with supplied fastening tape. This device communicated with the base to tell the base whether the door is open or closed.",4,1,2019-12-1,1,5,1
"I could have dealt with just not spending the money monthly to get the additional services that some ppl complained about, but this thing just did not work at all. I spent a couple of hours on ladders and waiting for the app to respond, factory resetting, repeating again and again. In the end, it never worked. Even those few times where the device would show up in my device list, the control didn't work and it didn't report the right status. Then it would stop responding. Wifi signal was great, it just didn't work. There's just no excuse in 2018 for an app to be that bad for a consumer product.Perhaps the biggest clue that this product is bad is that the instructions state to mount the unit 4-6 ft away from the garage door motor. So I dutifully measure 6ft and go to plug it in, only to realize that the cord it comes with is 5ft. A frustrating waste of time and energy.",1,1,2018-8-23,1,9,0
"These work, but the whole system is greatly flawed. I have cats that have access to the garage and they like to play ""beat the door,"" to see if they can get in or out before the door closes. If something causes the door closure to fail 3 times, you can only reactivate the controller by manually closing the door while at home and pressing the link button on the sensor. Sometimes, the sensor just disappears from the myQ app or website altogether, until you delete everything and re-add it all. There is no excuse for a device whose use is critical when you are away from home to ever stop working and require your physical presence at the house to reconnect. It should let me try to close the door as many times as I want. I have cameras that allow me to see if the doors are closed or not. I don't need this blind device to tell me I can't try to close the door again until I'm back home. If I take a week's vacation and it stops working on day 2, my garage is just going to be open for 5 more days? Ridiculous and terribly disappointing, but when it wants to work, it's awesome.",3,1,2018-8-28,1,1,0
"The MyQ hub is very easy to install.  I couldn't get my iPhone to connect to the hub (was using Bluetooth, I think I was supposed to connect with WiFi maybe?) but I used the WPS feature on my router and it connected almost right away.Installation in the garage was very simple with a cordless drill, and the unit immediately 'learned' my Craftsman garage door signal.  I now get notifications on my iPhone when the door opens and closes and if it stays open longer than I want I have the ability to close it remotely.  I'm very happy with the unit and would recommend to anyone who wants to have remote access and information for a Chamberlain brand garage door opener.",5,1,2017-11-2,1,1,0
"The package arrived on time and it only took 15 minutes to install.  It actually let's you open and close the garage from your phone and it shows how long the door is open or closed.  I was also able to connect it to my Nest camera and my Xfinity system, so that was a bonus.  Works great and does what it says.",5,1,2017-10-21,1,1,0
This is one of the worst products I've ever used.1. The device immediately closed my garage door every time I opened it manually! I could not open my garage door with the device installed. See attached video. For this reason I returned it. I'm not interested in trying to fix a problem that could lock me out of my house.,1,1,2019-7-22,1,6,0
"UPDATED REVIEW - 5/14/2019:I originally gave this thing one star, only because I couldn’t give it 0.25 stars. I’m updating to 4 stars only because it was a rocky start. It started off extremely frustrating.  You can read the saga, below. Both Chamberlain and Amazon Key customer service have been fantastic. Above and beyond. Unbelievable. Because it’s in Amazon’s best interest that their in-garage delivery program succeed. It took some time to get things right, but in the end I think I finally got it and it works flawlessly. Here’s hoping my internet or electricity never goes out so I don’t have to go through and reprogram this silly thing.Do these things and nobody will get hurt. Position your Chamberlain hub (the thing on the ceiling in your garage) away from any LED lights. This includes any LED lights that might be screwed into your garage door motor. (I know it’s 2019; there aren’t many choices when it comes to lightbulbs.) And I have some extremely bright LED shop lights on my ceiling as well. I moved my box (see the picture) 90 degrees away from the garage door motor and the LED lights. I think this is what did the trick. It seems to be outside the influence of LED electromagnetic fields. It does need to be at a minimum 4’ from the garage door motor, but the cable is only about 5’ so you won’t be going far. I also positioned the door sensor in direct line-of-sight of the Chamberlain hub. Whether this makes a difference or not, I don’t know. But after all I’d gone through, I was willing to try anything.",4,1,2019-5-1,1,7,1
Installation was really easy. One hub can control two garage doors if you buy a second sensor. The app works to control operations of the doors. However the Google integration is absolutely terrible. It was a pain in the butt to set up and every time you use it you have to ask to talk to myQ. Then this annoying guy's voice shows up and explains what you can do EVERYTIME.  Then you ask it to open the garage door 1 and it asked which one.  You tell it which one again and it says it is closed and then exits out. Thanks for nothing annoying MyQ!  Why can't these stupid smart internet of things be smarter?,2,1,2019-11-27,1,6,0
"First off, II have lots of smart home equipment and experience (e.g. Smart Home Alarm, Alexa, Hue hub and bulbs, Smart Cameras).  Installation of this ""smart"" garage door opener was easy.  It worked as expected for about one day.Then the garage door sensor would get out of sync if the garage was activated using a remote instead of the app and think the garage was open when it was in fact closed or vice versa.  I verified that this was not due to batteries in the garage door sensor.  The hub regularly times out and looses sync.  The iOS application (MyQ)  is very poor written.  Many of the submenus have no back button, so if you go into them, you have to kill the application and restart.  The application lost my Chamberlin hub from its settings several times and I had to reenter it by scanning the included QR code.",1,1,2019-5-2,1,6,0
"Several hours on the phone with a rude and condescending Chamberlain tech services person I am returning this and will be unable to have Amazon deliver in my garage. I have a Lift Master 1250LM opener made in May of 1995 (information stamped in metal on the opener) which is supposed to work with this but does not. Keypad outside and buttons inside work flawlessly.Adding this device did not work despite following directions exactly. Called tech services May 1, 2019 mid morning. Tech services person kept telling me that I was not following directions. That it needed to be 4 to 6 feet from the opener when I told her it was a measured 5.5 feet. Moved it to 4 feet then moved it to 6 feet with no success. Then she told me I was skipping steps on the app which I was not. Started over numerous times and told her each time the app wanted something or the screen changed and asked if it was Ok to go to the next step.",1,1,2019-5-2,1,5,0
"I bought this device to replace my existing Wemo Maker garage door opener, because I wanted to be able to use Alexa with it. Boy, was I wrong!First, I discovered that MyQ does not integrate with other smart home hubs like Alexa or Smartthings. The only way to do so is to use IFTTT. But to do that, Chamberlain demands $1/month! When I ordered this device, I missed the bullet (or it got inserted after I bought it) saying ""SMART COLLABORATIONS – Linking your myQ account to Google Assistant and IFTTT requires a $1 monthly or $10 annual subscription fee."" Even if I had seen it, I don't use Google Assistant, so I would not have cared.",1,1,2019-5-30,1,5,0
"They have subscription fee for connecting to Google home or IFTTT!!!After spending hours to set  and install this device I noticed that Chamberlain has monthly or yearly subscription fee for connecting to google home or IFTTT !!! While Google and other company provide their service for free for all smart devices this company is charging for this interface, I haven't heard of any other company to have subscription fee for connecting to Google or Amazon.",1,1,2017-10-12,1,1,0
"It's really a simple device and easy to install. I installed it and got it up and running in less than an hour. No hubs or anything else is needed -- other that a wi-fi signal. Works as expected and I will buy the second sensor, soon.When you open or close the door remotely, the unit beeps pretty loud and the light flashes about 5 seconds before it actually moves. That's a bit annoying. But if you think about it, that makes sense in the scenario where someone is in the garage and they have no idea the door is about to move. Besides, you're rarely activating it while inside the garage.",5,1,2017-12-3,1,1,1
"This has to be one of the biggest wastes of money I have unfortunately paid for.  Less than 2 months into owning it and the garage sensor has already died.  I have also had the same issue as other people where the garage door opens on its' own and no one has initiated the action.  This happened several times a week, so I had to disconnect the device.  I tried all of the items in the support pages to stop it.  Reading the reviews, I figured these issues were only a vocal minority but it turns out they both happened to me.I tried emailing Chamberlain 5 days ago and still have not heard back from them.  Unfortunately, the customer service of Chamberlain is on par with the quality of the product.  I had to disconnect due to my garage door opening randomly.  I was afraid that something would get stolen.",1,1,2018-3-5,1,7,0
"Before purchasing the myQ Hub to monitor my two overhead car doors, I reviewed probably 200 customer feedback postings.  While I noticed a number of negative claims that the MYQ-G0301 didn't work well I was hesitant to take those comments at face value as I had previously installed a myQ Chamberland opener on a 3rd overhead garage bay for my golf cart bay and had no issues at all in the last year with it.The G0301 installation went smoothly and flawlessly, but repeating the words of a number of posters in this blog YOU HAVE TO CAREFULLY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS for a number of reasons. !!!",5,1,2019-11-27,1,3,1
This is a product with much potential hampered by poor execution. There is no way to automate door opening. The excuse of security assumes the customer is clueless. I have been doing home automation longer than Chamberlain. The “connection” between hubs like Wink and this device are very unreliable.The opener has no recover function when shutting the door and something interrupts the door sensor  This could be as simple as attempting a close 15 seconds after an interrupt.  There is no way to trap for an error in logic.,1,1,2018-7-11,1,5,0
"First of all, it is a beast to set up. The app doesn't recognize (forgets?) the door opener after you have just set it up, over 10 times initially. Then it works for two or three times and will not operate after that. It is seeing the door sensor, because it accurately tells me that the door is up or down after controlling it with the remote (local) or the hardwired opener. It just refuses to work. Look it up on line and see all of the frustration that this product causes its buyers. The suggestions from Chamberlain on those pages JUST DO NOT WORK. If I do not hear from a rep from this review very quickly with a software/firmware update in the next day or two, I will return this thing. What a disappointment. This is my first negative review on Amazon...",1,1,2018-4-2,1,5,0
"In concept, a great product to make sure your garage door is closed and secure when it needs to be. I have a detached garage and live alone, so this purchase was more about piece of mind vs. allowing access in/out remotely. I installed very quickly the day it arrived (5/31), opened and closed as it should...alerts came in immediately. It is all about the alerts.On 6/2 I was in the garage and opened the door from the internal opener switch, no alert! Closed it and that alert came through. Opened and closed again later in the day, both alerts came through. An anomaly?? I hope so!",1,1,2018-6-7,1,6,1
"This is my second sensor besides the one for the main garage door that comes with the MyQ hub. The main garage sensor has worked flawlessly till now. But the additional sensor reports that the door is open when in fact it is closed. It takes some effort to get the door and the app/hub back in sync and one has to use the hardwired buttons to do this.It is annoying when you leave the house to get an alert that the door is still open, turn back and find out that the sensor lied. Not to mention spending another 10-15 minutes getting everything back in sync.",1,1,2018-10-5,1,1,0
"I was a little skeptical about this after reading some of the negative reviews but went ahead and ordered the kit and an additional door sensor to cover the two doors in my three-car garage.  The pieces are small and light, and installation was very easy following the directions in the quick-start guide.  After about 30 minutes I had everything in place and working.  The app was easy to install and set up as well.  Some of the app features are really neat, like the ability to have the doors shut automatically at a certain time every night, or to get alerts every time a door is operated.  For the price, I feel like it was a great value and it's working very well.  Recommended!",5,1,2018-9-12,1,1,0
"I have a home full of connected devices including Nest, Wink, Google Home, smart outlets, Chromecasts, connected lights, water sensors, etc, most of which are connected directly or via IFTTT.  Never, ever have I been required to pay a subscription to connect to any service from any other service.  Not only is Chamberlain wanting to you to pay a subscription, but they are wanting a fee for each different service you want to use!!!  On top of that, they are entirely unclear on what that subscription will provide you.  For example, the Google assistant connection only allows you to check door status and close it and they want you to pay monthly for that!  One of the only reasons I bought this device was to be able to use my phone to control the garage door since the remotes are aging and not working very well.  I thought I would be able to use Google assistant to open my garage door hands free.  Nope...I have to log into my phone, open an app and navigate it to open the door.  Not exactly safe or convenient.  The device itself does work well and the integration with Wink is nice, but Chamberlain highly overrates the value of the connections and they will not be getting any addition money from me nor any recommendations.",1,1,2018-11-30,1,2,0
"In two days, the app has failed multiple times including erroneously opening the garage while I was away.Chamberlain charges a premium fee for each integration, and this hub does not work at all with the google Home integration after hours of attempts to resolve their redirecting error that they are aware of for months.",1,1,2018-1-21,1,4,0
"It's 2019 and this thing still does not support Alexa? Be warned, this device claims to be smart but is about as dumb as they get. Half the time it thinks it's open when it is closed, and vice versa. Make sure you have a security camera in your garage to check it is closed. It does not support Amazon Alexa, and never will. It's a shame they sell this on Amazon but don't want to support the amazon ecosystem! The app frequently hangs. Setup is tricky and it can get stuck in endless loops during the setup process. I finally got the setup to complete on attempt EIGHT. The google, Wink, and Nest integration don't really do anything. If you want to do anything cool (and they really limit what you can do!), you have to pay lifetime fees for as long as you own the device. Not much, but as a matter of principle, a customer should not have to pay fees on something for this when the competition is free and they already PAID for the device. Customer service is unresponsive and they throw shade and attitude when you ask about enhancements to the product which require simple software changes. This will last until I move but will not buy their other wifi product such as Chamberlain  Belt Drive Garage Door Opener because I know they won't stand behind the product in the long run. I will be surprised if they support the next version of iOS and android after they stop selling this version of the device.",1,1,2018-11-29,1,2,1
"I purchased and installed this unit today in my garage. I followed the quick setup guide as well as the youtube video step by step like others have noted. I was all ready to connect the device using the MyQ app and all I get is the ""Connecting to device..."" screen on my android phone. For some reason this device will not connect to the device. The light on the unit above my garage is still blue. The device was located via the app but it will not connect and it just keeps trying to load and connect without success for some odd reason. It had stayed that way for almost a full hour until I finally just got tired of waiting and simply closed the app before my battery on my phone was completely dead. As of right now, I give this product a 1 star. I'll try to connect my device again tomorrow. If I can't i'll send it back and get a full refund and my rating will remain the same. As of right now I'm very disappointed in this product and I wouldn't recommend it at all.",1,1,2018-10-14,1,1,0
"This device is either poorly designed, poorly constructed, or both. I installed the first one, and despite getting a solid green light, the app said it couldn’t connect to WiFi (even though green light means it has connected). Kept resetting the device and re-trying, finally got the app to recognize that the device had connected. Similar problems connecting the sensor to the hub. Eventually, got it to connect. The app would open the door, but only close it one out of every 3-4 times. Most times it would require me to manually close the garage door. I figured it was defective, so got a replacement from Amazon. This one had similar problems recognizing WiFi connection, but installation was a little easier. However, it still will open the door, but not close it consistently. There’s nothing blocking any sensors. I give up. I notified when searching for fixes that Chamberlain has deleted all the threads from frustrated uses, and now only publishes a few of their own articles in the support area. This piece of junk is going back.",1,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
"I read another review stating that it took the reviewer ""hours"" to install this device. I had to chuckle. It takes no more than 20 minutes to install, and this includes mounting the bracket, installing the MyQ hub onto the bracket and attaching the garage door sensor onto the top panel of your garage door. SMH.With that out of the way, it works as it should and as advertised. My iOS, v11.3, gets instant notification when the door is opened or closed. It is absolutely convenient and breathtaking to be able to check the garage door status, and to open or close it with a phone! No more entering the garage door from the side door (for us folks with detached or attached but not connected garages).",3,1,2018-4-11,1,1,1
Until they stop jerking customers around and charging for integration with IFTTT/Google home/Alexa (which they continually promise but never deliver) I can't recommend this product to anyone.,1,1,2018-1-31,1,2,0
"We have had MyQ ""Smart"" opener for about a year or so, and it has continued to consistently fail us.The service is horrible, the app is incredibly glitchy, and about 25% of the time it actually gives you the wrong reading (i.e. says door is closed when it is open). Other times it creates errors and refuses to close the door, even when nothing is blocking the path of the door. this has caused us to go back and check whether or not our door is actually closed more than before we had the product.",1,1,2018-10-7,1,1,0
"Updated review: I had my first Amazon Key deliver this week. The hub device failed, creating a dangerous situation where the deliveryperson was unable to close the door, leaving the contents of my garage vulnerable to theft. When I got home to troubleshoot, the device was basically ""bricked"" - completely unresponsive, even after a reboot.Fed up, I returned the MyQ hub, and uninstalled the iPhone app.",1,1,2019-5-7,1,1,0

"Easy to install, works fantastic!  A little networking knowledge is helpful to install, but with the peace knowing your garage door is closed when it is supposed to be from anywhere in the internet world, this product is well worth the price! I have had many people tell me they have turned around mid trip to make sure their garage is closed, but they don't see the need for this product.  This is a solid solution people!  It is so simple and works so well that it really is a no-brainer!  I find myself checking the app often, and with the push notification that my garage door opened, I always know when family arrives home or leaves.  I had to let a dryer repairman into the garage before I could arrive and he was amazed I opened my garage remotely.  If I could geek out a little more, I would like to see a geo fence added to this so when I entered the fence....my garage would open.  I also set it up to automatically close my garage at 10:30p.m. nightly if I happened to forget to do it manually.  There is no worse feeling to going into your garage in the morning and realizing you left your garage door open all night!  Come on now....., you have all done that right?  I totally recommend this and I absolutely love it!  It took me under 30 minutes to install!  It has dropped from my network one time, but I was able to reset my router and it came back just fine!  Enjoy!",5,1,2018-3-27,1,1,0
"I really like this device - it works well with my older opener.  Phone app has useful controls and alerts, letting me know if the door is up or down, left up for an extended period, etc.  It was easy to connect, about an hour, and has a good range to connect to my router.My only issue is that it doesn't connect to Alexa.  To me the reliable phone app is most important, but Alexa connectivity would make it ideal.  It seems like such an easy thing to do. I guess this smart device isn't all that smart.",4,1,2018-4-10,1,1,0
"This is the worst device I have ever purchased.  I went through the set up, to everything was fine.  I even installed a WiFi booster just to add a little more range.  Everything worked fine for about a week.  It started not accurately stating the the status of my door.  Several times while I was away it said it was open, I had my daughter verify it was closed but the app still showed open.  This would correct itself when I got home and pressed the button on the door sensor.  This would be correct for about a week then start the issue again.  I reset the system and it continued this intermittent correct status/incorrect status issue.  This last time when I tried to reset the system again, it failed to reset completely.  I have tried to contact Chamberlain and NO ONE has responded!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!",1,1,2019-4-18,1,9,0
Bought this to add a second remote garage functionality to my IQ remote garage opener.  It is compact and attached easily to the garage door panel and its very easy to program.  My only concern is cost.  While a full controller and sensor costs $49; this sensor alone was $39! I took a star off of the overall rating because of that issue!,4,1,2019-5-5,1,1,1
"Here is my experience installing the MyQ hub and sensors. Upon making the decision to purchase this product I read a lot of the reviews and took note of those individuals that had issues and were able to solve the issues on their own or with tech support help. After opening boxes and making sure everything is there, I first downloaded the MyQ app on my cellphone. From there I followed the prompts within the app. I didn’t have to enter the serial number I just scanned the QR code and it was recognized. Then I entered my network password and I was ready to connect the door sensors. Mind you I was not in the garage at the time I did this but in the house relatively close to the router about 30 feet.I moved into the garage and placed the sensors on the very top panel of the garage doors (I have two doors). Had no issues with connecting sensors to hub, took about a minute for each sensor. At this point I pulled up the instructions for my garage door opener motor (Genie 2028 professional line) to located program button. Once that was located I activated the programing activity and followed the prompts in MyQ app. It took a couple of tries on the first garage door opener but it finally paired, when this happens your garage door will open. I was able to get the second opener paired on the first try, it takes about a minute. If you have this model opener, it’s the large square raised button, hold it until the purple light flashes, and then hit pair button in app.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,6,0
"DO NOT BUY. THIS PRODUCT CAN NOT BE TRUSTED TO WORK CORRECTLY. IT OPENED OUR GARAGE DOOR TO THE WORLD WHILE WE WERE 3+ HOURS AWAY AND WOULD NOT SHUT.I have been using the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain MYQ-G0301 - Wireless & Wi-Fi enabled Garage Hub with Smartphone Control that I bought off Amazon on July 16, 2019.  It has worked fine until recently. Naturally it stopped working correctly while we were away.  We were 3+ hours from home for the weekend and I kept getting alerts that my garage door is opening and closing multiple  times throughout the day. I thought it was an error with the app, false alerts......until my neighbor alerted me that my garage door was in fact open at 9:30pm, way past dark. I want an answer on how this happens, how does this product just start working on its own to open and close (multiple times and then won't shut through the app) the garage door while we are 3 hours away with nobody other than me having the app installed on my phone.  I can't trust this device to keep my garage shut and locked.  How is Chamberlin going to fix this situation?",1,1,2019-11-29,1,8,0
"Set-up was a breeze.  We needed this because the kids kept leaving the garage door open. Now we don't have that problem. Also, I had packs of woodland creatures in my yard that are sometimes rascally with my cats or the garbage can or they just noodle around in the yard without my express permission. So now I put a pile of warm ham in the middle of my garage and wait by the back window until I see one or more woodland creatures, for instance, rabbits, mice, raccoons, fox, and/or possums (not bobcats or similar), enter, then I click the autoclose feature on my smart phone and trap one or more of them inside. When they finish the ham, I enter through the side door with a large blanket and humanely trap them in a corner. Then I drive them to the forest preserve and release them in the area opposite my house (and closer to other houses) and then they don't bother me any more. I wear a large woolen jacket and sturdy work gloves so they don't bite me with their fangs or teeth. I will say that most small mammals make a disproportionately loud noise relative to their body size when you ensnare them in a large blanket. Don't be alarmed.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,2,0
"+ Easy install and setup.  From the time I opened the box until it was fully installed and setup was about 1 hour.  (i.e. skimmed the quick start guide, downloaded the app, programmed the hub, mounted the hub to the ceiling, mounted the sensor to the door, programmed my garage door opener, cleaned up).+ Intuitive app. Walks you through hub setup, sensor testing, garage door opener programming.

"I greatly enjoyed this product for about a week. That all changed when I suddenly got a garage door left open alert, despite watching it close fully when I left. Great, exactly why I bought this! Wrong. First, the remote close failed to close the door despite doing so several times before. It just sat there trying to close the door with a perfect internet connection for a minute and failed to produce so much as an error message. It just says the door is still open after it got tuckered out. Luckily, I had family at home to go close it. Several times after we have watched the door fully close (and for enough after to make sure it really closed) only to get a left open alert and walk out into the garage to see the door sitting open. We tinkered a couple times to try to use the app to close it after this and it always failed to do so regardless of where I was or how good the internet was. This is completely unacceptable. I don't know if it's garbage software or garbage hardware, but frankly, it doesn't matter. Having this in your home poses a massive security risk. Not to mention the google home connectivity is a joke. Don't waste your money.",1,1,2019-11-26,1,1,0
"I was looking for an easier option for my kids to be able to open the garage with their phones instead of the keypad. After all the mixed reviews I decided to give it a try. First, the instructions included are garbage. Impossible to setup with those instructions. After several google hits, I finally found the correct way to setup the device. For those of you that have issues. When they popup asked you to allow to switch to the mobile network, DO NOT ALLOW IT, or you will regret it. My cellular service in my area is bad so completing the setup via mobile data network was impossible. But once you allow it, it will automatically switch back to the mobile network and you will never complete the setup.The device worked fine for the first week or so. The first issue was waking up to an open garage. I had no schedules so; the garage shouldn’t open during the night. Now the device just wont work. I do the setup daily. Not kidding, when I say daily. Some days it works for me, but it won’t work for my kids’ phones. Keep in mind we have the same phones and I did not add new users on the app. They are using my user and password information.",1,1,2019-1-27,1,1,0

"Installation to my Craftsman garage door opener went pretty slick. It opens pretty quick from the app, longer to close (8 seconds).  Went to link it to Google Assistant and what do you know - I missed the small print at the bottom that says it costs $1 per month to subscribe to their premium service in order to use Google Assistant. In this day and age this is reprehensible. My bad, but it has ruined the whole purchase for me. A quick look shows that other devices do have compatibility with Google Assistant and Alexa. For $99 you would think you would get all the features . . .",2,1,2018-3-29,1,2,0
"I bought this when it went on sale for $50. I also bought a second receiver for $40, so all in $90 to operate two doors. An OK  price. There is a subscription option for $10 a year if you want to use it with Google Home but it doesn't really work well. .  I'll get to that in a bit.  Install is easy but the base needs to be located relatively close to the garage door or it will not work well... I'd estimate within 10 feet. Having two doors I had to locate the transmitter between the two openers to get it to operate reliably.  App works well-ish. Obviously if you have a weak cell or wifi signal it might not work well but that is to be expect and not a knock to this device.Now the bad stuff.",3,1,2019-5-12,1,1,0

"Installed it so I could easily confirm whether my garage door was shut-avoiding that middle of the night trip downstairs. or the U-turn to do a drive by to ensure that yes, I did close the door.  Well, it's useful for the former-not at all for the latter.  The hub doesn't recognize the opener when initiated by the remotes-at all.  So one can close the door and the app will show it as open.  Speaking of which, when one uses the app to close the door this REALLY annoying LOUD beeping goes off-and stays on even after the door is definitely down.  AFAIK there's NO way to turn this functionality off.  I also have failed to get the Alexa App on my Android phone to work with the hub either.

"I'm getting pretty into the idea of automating my home with Google Assistant, and NEVER have I heard of a smart device charging a subscription fee to use the functionality. I guess it's partially my fault for not reading this product's fine print before purchasing, but who would ever think a company would be so crazy to charge a subscription for something so basic. On top of that, it isn't even true Google integration--you have to ask for ""MyQ"" every time--this is not actually ""linking"" as described in the description--not even close! Easiest return decision I ever made, and a huge blow to my trust in Chamberlain if I'm in the market for garage door products in the future. What a waste of my morning.",1,1,2019-4-13,1,1,0
"Let me start with a few words of caution.  First, their explanation of what is compatible and what isn't, on Amazon, and even on their own website, is vague.  Second, the support that they have for Google assistant is not quite what you think it is.  I'll explain a little bit.First, the compatibility, they say that this is compatible with a lot of units, specifically for me, they say ""Genie units manufactured after 1996"".  Great I thought, mine was, so I should be good.  What they should say is ""all Genie units with a 'learn' feature to add remotes"" or ""only Genie units with Intellicode and learn functionality"" or something similar.  My Genie Blue Max, does not have the ""learn"" function, it still uses the old DIP switch method for remotes (any remote with the same switch settings will open the garage door) and the MyQ is NOT compatible with those systems because of how their remote is designed.  As it turns out, there is an upgrade kit for older garage door openers like mine, which retrofits this functionality and makes your system compatible.  If you search ""GIRUD-1T"" you should find it on Amazon.  So with that, my system was finally compatible with the MyQ",1,1,2019-12-6,1,5,0

"There's a subscription fee after the first 30 days, right after the returning window closes.

Out of all my smart products, smartplugs, smartlights, vacuum, harmony hub, blind shades, thermostats, fan, cameras etc etc this is the only product requires a subscription fee to be able to use it, also it's the only one it's not working.",1,1,2019-11-26,1,1,0
"They really advertise the MyQ Smart Garage Door opener around the holiday's and we just moved into a new house that only came with 1 garage door remote..So I figured the MyQ would work good for the 3 other people in the house with all different schudules going in and out of our house instead of going out and buying 3 universal remotes instead. So the installation process is pretty simple, the set-up and connection from my phone to get the garage open process, pretty easy. But....after I got the set up on my phone all done, I tried to set up my wife's phone. Could not connect to hers. Then I tried my daughter's phone. Wouldn't let me. Wellonly until reading reviews from other people online who just like me found out after buying the the MyQ that the The MyQ ""only"" allows 1 phone to connect to your garage door opener and they're still working on the multiple features for more than 1 phone at a time. So why would I want to spend $60.00 on a product just so I could be the only one in my house that can open my garage door with my phone? Yea thanks but no thanks!",3,1,2018-12-16,1,1,0
"Do not get this product.  I install smart homes for a living and this thing is not only junk that doesn't work, takes hours to setup and the Mfrs don't know anything about it or troubleshooting it.  Between myself a paid employee, and Chamberlain tech support - we spent 11 hours trying to get 2 garage doors to open and we could ultimately only get one door to work leaving the 2nd garage door disconnected from the system, we thought.  This was a 2nd home and the owners were back at their primary house.  I got a call from the Real Estate agent who received a call from the neighbor telling her the garage door was wide open and had been for 2 days.  The house was empty, no one was there and I was the only one with the app on my phone.  In addition, the 2nd garage door opened!!!  The one that wasn't connected to the system, or so we thought.  In short, they couldn't get their product to work as advertised because it wouldn't open the 2nd door no matter what we tried.  Then, magically without any actions, the door opened itself revealing a brand new Porsche.  And of course it didn't alert us that the door was opened because that door isn't on the system!!  WTF??  I left Chamberlain messages and emails stating that this was an absolute emergency that needed to be addressed and no one got back to me.  They don't care.  Stay away unless you want your garage doors opening randomly without notifications.  What could be worse, really?",1,1,2018-6-19,1,9,0
"Very cool! Got it today and installed it. Took about 25 min, but I took my time through the instructions. Had to use the separate instruction sheet for Apple phones. Looks like it was a process to join the hubs wifi in order to enter my wifi router's info. I was going to give it 4 stars since it was $100, but then I started playing with the app and it has some pretty cool settings.

"This is a very simple product and it should be a breeze to install.  However, the product as designed and manufactured is VERY idiosyncratic.  Specifically, the location of the MyQ hub is both critical to the operation of the product and impossible to discern except by trial and error.  The installation guides give you some ideas, but its still a guessing game.  I tried several locations on the garage ceiling and finally hit on one that works.  However, I have no idea why.Further, the error messages that the software gives you have nothing whatsoever to do with the real solution to the problem.  Chamberlain should be ashamed for shipping a product that is this unreliable.",1,1,2019-6-4,1,5,0

"I had woken up more than once to find my garage door open the next morning. We have a set of cameras so I knew it was human error each time it happened. So I bought this to help be a reminder.I had  no issue installing this. I have strong WiFi near my garage. Very easy. For about 3 days it worked flawlessly than the sensor got confused if it was closed or open and things began to spiral. The notifications sent by the MyQ thought the door was open when it was actually closed. Had to turn off alerts after a few days, but the scariest thing was I had set a schedule to auto close the door every day at 945p and last night the device thought the garage door was open and tried to close it. Instead the door was already closed and the signal opened the door. Luckily I got the notification and was home. Surprised it had run, I went out to look and the garage was wide open at 950p.  Too dangerous to rely on.",1,1,2019-6-28,1,4,0
"Initial setup was fairly simple, the MyQ App on my iPhone guided the entire procedure which took under 15 minutes.

I have now taken the old garage door remote out of my car and will use my phone exclusively, with the garage door's outdoor keypad as a backup if the phone battery is dead.After the initial setup it was not always closing the door (open commands always worked), so I found online how to do a factory reset; however, re-configuring it in the app didn't work; so I called Chamberlain support, and had a very helpful customer service agent get me back up and running in about 1/2 hour.

"Awesome wifi garage opener and very easy to setup! I was up and running in 15 minutes hooking this up to my 15 year old Craftsman garage door opener. The package contains one hub and one sensor to control one garage door. The hub can control 2 doors, so if you have 2 doors, you will have to buy an additional sensor(https://www.amazon.com/Chamberlain-G821LMB-Sensor-Garage-Sensor-Myq-G0301/dp/B078C95181). If you have more than 2 garage doors, you will have to purchase an additional kit with a hub and sensor(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075H7Z5L8). Few pointers:1. Make sure the location of the hub will have a good wifi signal.

I can be in the house or at work and it won’t  work. If I try it more then three times it will kick the app off-line.

"Let me start off this review by saying, from an IoT/smart home point of view, this was a very simple add on to our existing “dumb” liftmaster garage door and brought some app-based control that I had long been after—the garage door! This thing was a breeze to install, the new app walks through all of the steps in great detail. The interface is also great. We are on gig/fiber internet and an Orbi WiFi mesh at the house, so zero issues getting this thing a fast, reliable connection. Overall, it does exactly what I wanted, which was to have anywhere-Control and status check for our garage door.So....with all of the above 5 star commentary, why the 2 star rating? This thing has the most ANNOYING warning beeps that go off...every...single...time you close the door. Look; I understand it’s a safety precaution and Chamberlain is covering their ass...but seriously, these warning beeps last for the entire time the garage door is closing (about 10 seconds) and then about 6-8 seconds after the door has already closed. It feels like it will never end to be honest...like a smoke detector going off when you burn the thanksgiving turkey and are desperately fanning to make it stop. It’s only been installed for 2.5 days now and my wife is already complaining, which anyone that’s married knows...this thing is on the chopping block. Why on earth Chamberlain wouldn’t have worked in the option to disable the beep from the app is beyond me. Have a “release of liability” pop up that lets the customer sign away the safety for some damn peace and quiet. I’d like to close my garage door and not have my neighbors think there’s a 4 alarm fire going on.",2,1,2019-6-21,1,3,0
"Beware! This product is difficult to setup, has continuous issues, and they charge you to connect to Google Assistant or IFTTT. Nest support is discontinued August despite packaging. This product is not worth the hassle or not-adequately-disclosed extortion. 0/10!I am extremely regretting my purchase of the MyQ Smart Garage Hub. It took me 6 hours to set up this product because of wifi connectivity issues, door sensor connectivity issues, and garage door opener pairing issues. All of the support links on Google results have been taken away with non-helpful articles left in its place. The only help I actually got in setting up this product was from the product reviews on Amazon. I was under the impression in purchasing this product that it would work with my Nest account, Google Assistant, or IFTTT, but after finally setting the device up, I find out that is wrong. The Nest support is going to be discontinued August and the other 2 options require $10/yr or $1/mo. I really wish this was made clearer before buying and/or the product was easier to set up.

"The garage door opener works as expected in an isolated manner, meaning that using the myQ app you can close and open the garage door easily with the push of a button. The issue here is that I bought this with Google home integration in mind which they state is supported. Apparently in June of 2019 they stopped requiring a subscription fee to even support this functionality (a fee for telling Google to open your garage door is ridiculous).I quickly found out after installation that the linking of the service to Google home is horrendous.

"I cannot believe I missed this when I was researching a smart garage option. First of all, it MyQ integrates with Alexa if you use IFTTT - easy and free to set up an account and to get a ""subscription"" (right now they are free but I hear MyQ (AKA Chamberlain) does charge for it from time to time) from MyQ to connect to IFTTT. But the only thing you can do is ""close"" your garage door. Agent told me it is a security violation to allow anyone else to open your door but them. Which isn't true. If you sign up for the Chamberlain/Amazon, leave it in your garage, option, then Amazon drivers can open your garage. But you, who owns the opener, the MyQ hubs, the Amazon devices, aren't considered worthy enough to open their door. So. When you get home you can get your lights turned on, set your thermostat then open another app to open your garage door. Picking nits? Sure. But this is just ignorant.The other things like ease of installation and getting it to work, easy peasy. Everything worked 100% out of the box. Connected and installed as the book said. Tells me how long the garage door has been opened or closed. We like to keep the door open about 4"" for the draft effect and to suck out the heat in the summer time.

"I needed something to monitor my garage door via WiFi. Instead of replacing a good-functioning motor, I decided to give the MyQ a try. I ordered it from Amazon and I will say that the setup is pretty straight forward, and easy to follow. Their app instruction mimic the Ring devices step-by-step setup. My only caveat was that it took a while to get the Door Sensor to sync to the hub. It wasn't doing it after several tries of the push button. Through a miracle, it worked and I got the BEEP!! confirmation. I tested the device several times throughout the day. It's essentially an additional remote control, sync'd to a hub that connects to your WiFi that connects to your app. My down expectations is that just like every cloud device, if their servers go DOWN then your device won't work in the app until Chamberlain fixes their cloud servers. Happened on June 7 2018 according to my research. I did had a problem were after setting it up, I went up to unplug the hub from the floor outlet to hook it up to the ceiling outlet. The app couldn't find the hub so I had to re-set it again. This tells me that if there's a power outage, will I have to do the setup again every time? Time will tell if the investment was worth it or not. As of a 24 hour period, I'm satisfied. CAUTION: pressing on the DOOR picture on your app will trigger the door to open/close. So make sure you maybe play with it while your in front of the garage door, not away from your home. And you can even use their website http address but with the same caution: Don't click on the garage door image if you don't want it to open if you're not home. The app/website doesn't give you an ""are you sure?"" warning. Pressing means open sesame.",4,1,2018-8-9,1,5,0

Opening worked, closing did not for some reason that I can't fully explain.

This is a good way to see if your garage door is open and also can open and close the door remotely. It works just fine but it is a little hard to set up because the software is a little clunky and the instructions pretty bad.

"Added MyQ Smart Garage Hub to a 20 year old Overhead Door Phantom opener.  Installing and adding devices through the iOs app is buggy at best.  Eventually, I was able to get it working using their web portal, which is fine - just don't send me down the rabbit hole of a first time installation through the app.  Very hard time getting Alerts to work.  Each time, after adding an alert and testing, it would fail.  Going back in to look at  the settings for the alert, it would be deselected, despite the fact that I had turned it on repeatedley (and selected ""save"").  Finally got alerts to work, again, only through the web portal.  Then tried to add a second door without a sensor.  Their setup process asks if you have a sensor or not, selecting ""not"" continues the setup process, but never successfully.  After 1.5 hours of repeated tries, called Chamberlain.  Rep says no you can't add a second door without a sensor.  OK, fine - but why not mention in the setup process when you answer ""no"" to the question about a sensor, that you can't add a second door without a second sensor.  Very poor documentation and a buggy app.  If I hadn't already installed the device on my garage ceiling, I'd be boxing it up and sending it back..  I do not recommend.",1,1,2019-4-1,1,5,0

"I completed the installation and set-up in about 20 mins.  If it matters I already have a Chamberlain Door Openner, so maybe that helped ease the process.  For all the folks having major trouble I wonder what they are doing wrong, or what their situation was.  If you have an iPhone, be sure to follow the supplemental instructions for connecting the hub to your WiFi.  Again, I had no issues.  However, if you want to add additional phones/devices to control the hub/door, you simply use the same account on subsequent devices as the original one.  Seems odd and counterintuitive, but that is the way it is.  And this bit took me a while to figure out, and only through reading a review, not guidance from the manufacturer, so that is something they could do better.  I guess for the uninitiated the directions are a bit thin, but therein't a whole lot going on here.  The unexpected bit was connecting to the hub as its own WiFi network, then using a web address to configure/attach the hub to my home WiFi.  Which went smoothly following the menus and prompts.I am able to control the door from my iPhone or the wife's (using the same account), set up custom alerts that appear to be working, and have not had any issues or complaints with the operation.  The most important part is knowing the status of the door from our phones.  That mean selling feature for us, also seems to be working as advertised.",5,1,2018-2-26,1,5,0
"UPDATE: Lowered to one star from three. Both garage door sensors continue to give out false readings, showing garage doors are open when they are closed. The MyQ troubleshooting tips on the support website did not help. And e-mail to support has gone unanswered after a week. Worse, the main garage door will not close remotely. The hub sounds a siren and displays a warning light, but nothing happens. I have not tried repairing my Overhead Door garage door to the hub again. Quite frankly, I don't have time for such a flaky system. Perhaps these bugs will get ironed. If so, I'll update my review again.Installation was easy. The hardest part for me was the ladder work because I have tall garage ceilings. Still, the included bracket made attachment simple. The app has a decent installation walk-through for pairing, naming, testing. There's also detailed help on the website. Now, for the details:",1,1,2019-8-11,1,3,0
"This is an excellent idea, but that's where the good part ends. After 4 hours following the ""easy"" step by step directions, I finally gave up and started the return and refund the same day I received it. Both my garage door openers ""should"" have been compatible, and one of them actually has the MyQ logo, but I couldn't get the hub to connect to either one of them.",1,1,2019-11-27,1,4,0
"Here is my experience installing the MyQ hub and sensors. Upon making the decision to purchase this product I read a lot of the reviews and took note of those individuals that had issues and were able to solve the issues on their own or with tech support help. After opening boxes and making sure everything is there, I first downloaded the MyQ app on my cellphone. From there I followed the prompts within the app. I didn’t have to enter the serial number I just scanned the QR code and it was recognized. Then I entered my network password and I was ready to connect the door sensors. Mind you I was not in the garage at the time I did this but in the house relatively close to the router about 30 feet.I moved into the garage and placed the sensors on the very top panel of the garage doors (I have two doors). Had no issues with connecting sensors to hub, took about a minute for each sensor. At this point I pulled up the instructions for my garage door opener motor (Genie 2028 professional line) to located program button. Once that was located I activated the programing activity and followed the prompts in MyQ app. It took a couple of tries on the first garage door opener but it finally paired, when this happens your garage door will open. I was able to get the second opener paired on the first try, it takes about a minute. If you have this model opener, it’s the large square raised button, hold it until the purple light flashes, and then hit pair button in app.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,2,0
"I returned a product I ordered that didn't do notifications, but setup worked on that unit perfectly. For this one, and being in the technology industry, setup was 10 minutes. Seriously, that easy. But it failed to work. Setup was smooth, click the app, and nothing happened. After some user error in trying to delete and restart the process (4 times), I figured it out and got it to work. Hurray!An hour later, my garage opened and shut. BY ITSELF. I unplugged it. Was sending it back. But decided to give it the old college try (I'm stubborn). It worked overnight. This morning, my girlfriend opened and closed it, I saw the notifications while at work, and then she text me when she got home. Garage was OPEN. Not good. I've read reviews and some FAQs online and after contacting support, the same thing. They said to delete all my programming (the two vehicles and the keypad remote) to start over because ""I must have allowed ANOTHER REMOTE to gain access while in learning mode."" Wow. Seriously? First of all, what are even the odds of this happening? Secondly, are you joking me? So you're telling me someone else is opening my garage?",1,1,2019-9-3,1,2,0
"I like this product when it works.  When it doesn’t be prepared to pull hair out.  VERY difficult to figure it out.  Reviews will bear this out.  MyQ lacks a lot of plug and play.  However, when it;s working, it;s wonderful.  I had system in about 14mos before it went offline and simply couldn’t get it to work.  So bought a new one (this is where expense comes in).  OH the new hub won;t work with the ;old; sensor... so irritating.  BUT again, now that it;s working, I love it!  I know when pet sitter is coming in and out, how long they are there.  I know 3 blocks away if I left door open and if so? I can close it.  Those make it worth while but if someone else comes up with an easier to install product, I’ll try it in a minute next time I go offline with MyQ. This doesn’t feel like rocket science, so I expect someone will fix this soon.  I don’t like how I can’t have separate accounts for MY garage and rental garages for example, they all have to go on the same account so constant alerts.",4,1,2018-10-29,1,3,0
One fine product!  Had it installed in no time.  I have included pictures of what you need to do to install this.  First I want to say there is NO wiring to do!

"I purchased this unit and a 2nd door sensor back in late March 2020, and everything installed easily.  The first thing I noticed is when you close your garage door, the unit emits an obnoxious flashing strobe light and a very loud piercing beep.

"I thought this was the perfect solution for those times that I ""can't remember if I closed the garage door"".  Easy to do on a hectic morning.  The reviews and recommendations coupled with the low cost made this an easy choice.  First, the installation was fairly simple.  The app was easy to setup.  To my dismay however, Amazon Echo integration is not easy.  I gave up after a few frustrating tries.  I decided to just use the app to interfacing with the device.  It seemed to work fine in the beginning.  Opening and closing as expected.  But after a few weeks, I started to get reports that the door was open.  Even when I was at home and able to verify that it wasn't.  I checked the sensor and found no problem with its position.  If the door is closed and the app reports that it is open and you issue the close command, the app reports back after a a minute to visually confirm that it is closed.  The final straw for me came when I received a call from my wife one morning and she said she couldn't remember if she closed the garage door.  I checked the app, and sure enough, the app reported that it was open.  I attempted to close the door from the app, and got the ""check to see if it closed"" message.  Can't do that when you are away.  Well guess what?  When she arrived home later that day, the garage was open.  I am done!  I expect better reliability and communication.  I have numerous wifi devices at home that have no problem reporting their state.  Not worth the money, even at $40.  I am going to look for something more reliable.  Any suggestions welcome.",3,1,2020-8-13,1,1,0
"Works very well to update our older Chamberlain openers. We travel a lot, and it's nice to get a notification if the door gets opened, whether intentionally by the girl who brings in our mail, or by some bad guys.I purchased one extra transmitter (the main set can use up to 2) so I could cover both our garage doors.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,1,0
"This setup is very easy to install.  The app works great for controlling the door and it integrated smoothly with my garage door opener (mine is Chamberlain brand).  However, there are a couple of drawbacks to this system.  One, it is not directly compatible with Alexa if you're looking for that feature.  I assumed it would given that it works with Amazon Key, however, this is not the case.......at least not easily.  Using third party software you can get it to work with Alexa but this takes a bit of time to set up as there is no native skill.  The second drawback, in my opinion, is the loud beeping when the garage door closes.  This is a security feature that Chamberlain feels that all users must have and not be able to deactivate.  The most simple solution to this involves unscrewing the back of the unit, grasping the speaker cover with a pair of pliers and twisting it off, then cutting the wires to the speaker for good measure (see attached photo) .  This will disable the speaker completely rendering the safety beep useless and permanently subjecting yourself and your family to the crushing strength of the garage door.....which will not drop completely if you're under it anyway due to the IR sensors that were installed with the door opener.  But I digress..... The end result from my experience and a few hours time is an Alexa compatible garage door opening system that doesn't deafen you when it closes.  Good luck!",4,1,2019-11-23,1,1,1
"Garbage, would not recommend.First one wouldn't even go into wifi paring mode (none of the LEDs would stay on). Replacement paired right away. Install was a breeze. WiFi signal is strong yet it has issues on a daily basis. One day it's offline. The other it states it is opening the door when it is doing nothing. Power resets only work sometimes. Only reason I gave it two stars it's because I picked it up when it was on sale. Even then, I'll be returning it. Completely unreliable.",1,1,2019-5-30,1,3,0
"Plugged it in and synced it to my existing garage door. It worked great to open and close the garage. Drilled the holes and mounted it. It would reliably open the garage door but not close it. I'd push the button and it would beep but the door wouldn't close. I'd push it again and I would get an error that  the close function was pushed too many times and I had to manually push the button on the wall to clear the error. This happened repeatedly. Totally unreliable and a big security risk. Does not function as designed. When it does reliably close, it beeps like a smoke detector for 30 seconds. Loud and pointless.Now the Google integration...you have to subscribe to the MyQ premium service. Currently there is no charge. This allows the Google assistant to talk to MyQ to initiate commands. Like a game of telephone. Google starts a conversation with MyQ. Ten MyQ service can't reliably tell you if the door was open or closed. It would tell me that the door was closed when it was open. And opening the garage isn't an option. Just an a around disappointment. I don't know why they're even allowed to sell this.",1,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"I got another brand garage opener for the internet and it was directly wired, still the device didn't work well.  This device uses the way method as your car remote, and works better.  It has never been down while it was up, and visa versa.  It has worked flawlessly.  I admit I don't use it much.  I do have car remotes and the other brand work good with HomeKit.  But the other brand did mess up here and there and opened when you wanted to close (scheduled closing), while this one didn't.  The biggest flaw with it, is that you have to buy another device just to get it to work with it.  It makes no sense why something already getting out to the internet (so it has wifi and communicate to servers), can't get a firmware up date and get it working.  It's so cheap right now, I'm going to use it til I get tired of using an app or my wife wants to use HomeKit to open it.  I'll probably get a iSmartGate Pro because one device can handle 2 doors and do HomeKit.",3,1,2020-7-8,1,1,0
"The primary reason I wanted this was so that I can automatically open/close the door.  For example, I want my door to automatically open as I approach the house and close as I leave.  While this does integrate with IFTTT you can't actually automate anything because of ""security"".  This type of integration used to work, and why else would you even make this product if it weren't to enable smarts like this.  But every bit of functionality has been stripped to make it ""secure"".  This is why they stopped charging for the service as the don't really offer any services of use anymore.  This is such a complete failure that even at $18 it's not worth it.  I have to imagine the number of good comments were all written before this functionality was stripped out.What's even more incredible is that I can actually automate opening the door when I leave, but I can't close it.  In what scenario would any person consider that to be a ""safe"" thing to do.  Is that so you don't trap the burglars you just let into the house?  This is definitely a case of the lawyers defining the product capabilities.",1,1,2019-12-21,1,1,0
"It says you can connect to Google Home but you can't actually control the door!  You can only ask  the status of the door.  The whole reason I wanted this was to be able to voice control and it won't do that.  Also, the ""free for a limited time"" means you'll have to pay $1/month or $10/yr for the luxury of asking Google if your door is open.  I went with another controller and I love it.  The functions I need and it prevents someone from yelling in the window to operate it by requiring a PIN number.",1,1,2019-7-12,1,4,0
"I've got it working, but I can't give this a very high rating.  The first door was lightning fast and easy to connect to the MyQ hub and web site.

It seems to be just as durable and sensitive as the first one once you get it working.",4,1,2019-4-11,1,3,0

Please check your internet connection and try again."" My internet connection is fine, I have other devices in my home that are connected and they are all working perfectly.  It's this crappy app. Oh, and there is literally nothing you can do if you can't log into the app. You also get no customer support.

"The basic Open/Close functions from the app are fine.  But I wanted the auto-scheduling option as my main feature.Sometimes our garage gets left open  :(  So I have scheduled MyQ to ""Close every night at 9:00"". It does not work.  However, I do receive a text telling me that it tried to close the door but failed and to manually close the door... So I just go and press the button to close the door when left open.  The door gets closed, but that is not really how I thought it should work.",1,1,2019-7-23,1,4,0
"Once installed, this has been working great.  Installation was a pain due to problems in the Chamberlain instructions.  Knocking off 1 star for that.During install, you're asked to specify brand (LiftMaster for me) and color of the 'learn' button on the garage door opener.  The instructions printed right on the garage door opener call the button on my unit an 'orange' button.  So, I went through the install process 30+ times trying to get the MYQ-G0301 to pair with the garage door opener, always telling the install program i have an orange button.  After spending 30 minutes on hold with tech support, I spent 60 more minutes with tech support troubleshooting, during which the the MYQ-G0301 was restarted multiple times and even factory reset twice, my home wifi router was restarted, and both the android and computer desktop browser interface were tried.  Finally - tech support offered this gem ""Try telling the install program you have a ""purple"" button on your garage door opener"".  Everything then started working perfectly.",4,1,2018-12-2,1,2,1

"Very VERY disappointed. The Chamberlain website makes it clear that this unit will support multiple users with different roles. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If you want to give others access to your garage opener, you must give them your sign in credentials. They will have the same access and permissions as you have. I am returning my unit and ordering a different model from another manufacturer.",1,1,2018-3-25,1,9,0
"I will start with the good. It was very easy to install. The mounting, the setup, linking it to an old Chamberlain garage opener - it was all a breeze. It doesn't come with instructions, all of the steps are through the initial set up in the app. The app has a bug where even if you decide you don't want to watch the video it keeps the audio on even if you lock your phone. I found that extra annoying since i had to pause my install to have a conversation with my wife and the app kept its audio on.I do have a detached garage and that is why i have a wifi extender. The MyQ was installed no more than 10 feet from the wifi extender with unobstructed view to it. The app showed all of the signal bars. A full length of the power cord away from the garage opener to avoid interference. No LED lights anywhere near. The garage sensor in open position was about a feet away from the main unit.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,1,0
"An absolute pain to set up. If you expect ease in setup, you're in for a rude awakening.The hub failed multiple times just to connect to my network, and once it finally did connect, it would not connect to my door opener's motor at all, despite the fact that my opener is a chamberlain and is compatible according to the app. I followed the instructions to the letter, and the hub continued to fail to connect to my motor after over a dozen attempts.",1,1,2019-11-24,1,4,0

I had this option years ago through a previous smart-home system that I replaced a while back.  We have keyless entry, but it's not always convenient to hand out codes or for friends and family to remember them.  With MyQ, we can open or close the door remotely.I also have a forgetful son who has left the door open by accident when heading out to school.

Had a terrible time getting it to connect to my wireless network. Finally found on their troubleshooting site that I had to turn off a function on my android phone. Several more hub resets and connection attemps it finally connected. Then wouldn't connect to the door sensor until many tries later. Then it wouldn't mate with the door opener. The learn button on the opener has an LED that goes on when it is in learn mode. It flashes when I train a remote to it. It never flashed when the hub was supposedly being trained to it. Great idea but terrible execution. Returning to Amazon.,1,1,2019-7-19,1,4,0
"Works as promised. I installed it in a couple minutes, and can control the doors with my phone.  My favorite parts are the Schedule, and the alerts.  I programmed my doors to shut at 9pm everyday.  This prevents leaving them open overnight, automatically.  I also set it to notify me if the doors are left open for more than 45 minutes.  The only con was during the install the wifi joining procedure was not real intuitive.  I was lucky enough to have had similar experience with another smart home automation product, and was able to use that experience to hook up this one correctly.

"I just got this installed and once set up it seems to work pretty well once set up, but setting it up was a hassle as it seemed finicky to pair with my overhead door standard drive 650. Here are a few of my lessons learned so far.1. The mounting location in your garage is extremely important, I originally mounted it about a foot from the opener and it struggled, then I turned it 180* like it suggested and it still struggled, then I had success just mounting it on the other side of the garage near my workbench, but when I tried to reprogram it later, it wasn't receiving the signals (I could tell by watching the light on my opener which flashes when it senses a signal during the programming process, it never blinked. After moving it around I noticed more and more activity). I ended up having success mounting it the full length of the power cord away which put it right in the middle of my two openers at the same distance.",4,1,2018-7-18,1,5,0
"If Amazon allowed less than one star, I would give it a 1/4 star.  This product look nice and the packaging looks nice.  But the hardware is hardly laughable.  I am by no means an IT professional, but I did grow up building computers and do my own IT trouble shooting and have heavy experience with tech troubleshooting and electronic repair.The setup is extremely unresponsive unless you have the router in the next room.  And by next room, I mean right by the receiver unit.  My iPhone reads full bars of WiFi reception when the unit can barely get a signal of 1 tiny bar of WiFi reception from my router.  Keep in mind, I have a $150 Linksys EA7500V2.  The router range is more than enough to reach the garage; it actually reaches to the street which is an easy 100 ft away.  Not the top of the line router, but a very good one for a basic household.  I was not able to get it connect to the router one time in the 2 hrs that I was fiddling with it.  All I got was a frustrating 2 hrs in the sauna of a garage here in the HOT August South Texas heat.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this garage door opener hub to anybody.  Hell, I feel bad to try to sell this barely used to somebody else.  My fault for not doing my own research on the product before buying it.",1,1,2019-8-21,1,2,0
"The hardware is really good, and the app for this opener had been great since I started using it last year, In fact better than great.  I had found it to be very relyable and extremely useful.

Finding out the app lost my password AGAIN and having to control a wild puppy IN THE RAIN while looking up a password just to open the freaking garage door. Then once a week my family calling me at work to open the garage door because the stupid app lost their SAVED password again for the 3 time that week.  Then getting home after a hard day at work to find mine did the same thing and having to look up the password before pulling into the garage.And thats when it loads,  I have had to uninstall and reinstall the app on 2 different phones just to get it to load after its update.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"I like this garage opener from the stand point that it works well when using the MyQ app on my iPhone. It does not however work well with Alexa. For one there is no native integration, which should not be difficult to do at all. Additionally when using Alexa to try to control the garage door it assumes names like bay 1 and bay 2 which make no sense when I have only 1 garage door and 1 sensor, and then saying ""open bay 1"" doesn't do anything anyway. Additionally when closing the garage door through the app the base unit beeps and flashes a bright light which I really do not like. I wish that there was an option to turn it off through the app. While it is surely meant to be a safety feature the garage already has it's own safety sensors (infrared beam + pressure sensor), the noise and light can wake everyone up at night and I may not want to draw attention to myself and that my garage door is open (there was a recent car jacking in a nearby house garage when the garage door was open for example). I am looking forward to an app and/or firmware update to improve the Alexa integration and to control the sound/light so that the door works as smoothly as other smart locks and Alexa-enabled devices in my house. This is the only one that does not work well outside of the vendor's app. Besides that installation was very easy and opening and closing the garage door works reliably.",3,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0

The short version is that there is a hub that needs to go in the garage, in range of your WiFi and the garage door sensor.

"Unlike every other smart device I have purchased, this product is not DIRECTLY controlled by Google Assistant (even though Google Assistant is capable of controlling garage doors directly). Instead of asking Google to ""close the garage door"", you have to say ""ok google ask myq to close the garage door"". Then, it transfers you to a separate myq assistant (which is pretty inflexible) to actually carry out the task.Connecting the myQ assistant to Google was a huge pain and took a lot of work since the documentation in the myQ app was inaccurate.",1,1,2019-12-16,1,1,0
"The product works, I'll give it that.  But there are some gotchas.  Here is the first one.  You set it up via your smartphone.  Many devices do that.  But if you have a smartphone that will use EITHER WiFi or Celldata access, you must first turn off the Celldata access!  If you do not, your phone, while trying to get into the MyQ device, will constantly switch to the cell network trying to get an internet connection, and your install will fail.  The instructions do NOT tell you this.  Ya gotta be a guru to know that trick.Once past that, the install goes very well as long as you follow the instructions.  But there is an issue with guest access.  To do that your guest needs to install the MyQ app on their smartphone, which requires you rto have the serial number of the door opener available.  If you do not, you cannot complete the guest setup.  Remember to log that SN in a place where you can find it.",3,1,2019-5-2,1,1,0
"This garage door opener never worked right. I thought it would be nice to open the garage with Alexa, just to find out you can’t use it with Alexa, not even ifttt (unless you want to pay for their scam service). Sometimes it would tell me I had left my garage open, so I would try to close it from the app. It would say it failed and the app wouldn’t work until I operated it from home. Not helpful when you can’t leave work. Lo and behold, sometimes my garage had been left open but sometimes my garage was shut as it should have been when I drove all the way home in a panic and hurry. Result of a fake garage open warning. Even standing inside my garage, the app rarely worked to close the door. Luckily all these problems occurred so often in the first month that I was able to return it before I was stuck with the piece of junk. In the last month they have lowered the price of this thing nearly $30, having trouble selling? This is why! Nothing but issues.",1,1,2018-11-21,1,5,0
"Sometimes wi-fi in the garage is not as good as you need.  install went great.  door shut. everything was fine.  then door would not open.  nothing worked except the notify!  I tried pairing again. nothing. paring worked sometimes then did not. but door would not open or shut.  I opened the door with my normal remotes I got notified via myQ.  tried resets,  reinstalled nothing changed.  so when I had time I deleted everything.  reset completely twice.  reset the sensors twice.  and started over again moving an inside wi-fi extender closer to get a better wi-fi signal.  took cars out of garage to make sure they were not in the way.  and did the re install from the start (except for the hardware)  door opened as before.  so held my breath.  finished the install.  and hit the close button twice.  door closed.  yea!  nice to be able to open the door from a block away.. as sometime the car remotes don't open the door even when we in front of the garage door!!!!  yep.  so now amazon can deliver in the garage nice if it is raining.. they tend to leave stuff out in the rain!!  been looking for a low cost mobile app to open and close my garage door and it works.  just have to follow the install perfectly.  there are videos to trouble shoot. don't skip over anything.  my hub is 5 feet from my opener.  my sensor is on my left side of my door.  I did all tests to make sure it all worked.  and of course made sure my door opener was compatible before I ordered.  it is and is only 5 years old.  I would have given 5 star if there had been a little better instructions on resetting the sensors too. you have to reset them all not just the hub.  and if anything fails you have to start over completely.  yep.",4,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0

"I bought the unit looking at the reviews and was super excited to use my phone to monitor my garage door from anywhere. The product was easy to setup but failed to work every time. I did multiple resets and different tricks to make it work but in fact it messed up my garage door travel limits and it stopped responding to the wall garage door opener.  I had to spend couple of hours to fix it to work normally with the wired opener.When devices are dependent on wireless technology the reliability will become an issue, in  this case the remote uses WiFi and also Bluetooth communication, I am not sure if that caused complexity in terms of bad WiFi signal and or Bluetooth reception/interference issues.",1,1,2019-1-1,1,4,0
"This is easy to install, in principle. It installed very quickly but took about 25 tries to get paired with my opener. Moved onto door #2. 10 tries in or so door #1 starts going up. Then door 2 goes. Says pairing failed, but somehow it's now controlling both doors at the same time when you try to control door 1. It senses both doors are moving but doesn't realize it's controlling door 2 also. If door 1 is up and 2 is down, and you use the app to close door 1, door 2 goes up. So after an hour of screwing around, I set them both in monitor only mode and gave up for the night. Literally as I read on my phone for help, it alerts me that the door just went up. Sure enough, I check and both doors are now open. The app has somehow reverted to the previous state, before I put them both in monitor mode, and sent a signal to open the doors on it's own. WTF.",1,1,2019-7-16,1,3,0
"I like the fact I can tell if the door is open or closed at any time and open and close it remotely. What I don't like is the surprise you get when you try to integrate it into your home hub. They charge a monthly fee. What BS. Charge a little more for the unit if you need to, but this money grab of a monthly fee is ridiculous.While this won't make me return the item, (return shipping will cost a quarter of what I paid for it) I cannot and will not recommend this product nor purchase anything from Liftmaster/Chamberlain ever again.",1,1,2019-7-9,1,4,0
"The good; this works reliably and hooks up with a bunch of garage door motors giving you a ""smart"" garage (more on that later) in that you can set notifications of when your garage opens and most importantly open it with your phone.The bad; the ""smart"" integration is a joke. Is Chamberlain for real requiring a paid subscription so you can ask your google home or alexa to open the garage? Come on Chamberlain be better than that.",4,1,2020-9-13,1,3,0
Update:  would give zero stars if I could. Bought to make sure my family was safe while I was away. Tonight at midnight it opened when the program is supposed to close it if it was open. I noticed the alert on my phone saying it closed. Went out to check it and lucky for us the local cops were outside writing a note to let us know our garage was open after midnight. So the very device I’m trusting to lower our risk is actually creating risk. I will try to return it or it will go in the trash as a lesson learned.Original review:,1,1,2018-9-9,1,4,0
"Not many products can make me angry enough to take the time to write a review, but well done Chaimberlin, you win the prize. I purchased this thinking it would integrate with Amazon Alexa, since it boasts compatibility with Amazon Key, but somehow they neglected to include Alexa support. It will link up with IFTTT, which might cause one to incorrectly assume that you just need to walk through a few more steps to get it working. However, using the IFTTT link you cannot open the garage door for some unknown reason, you can only close it. As well as do a few other arbitrary tasks that no one cares about. Oh and by the way, thats only AFTER paying for their ridiculous subscription to allow you to integrate the services. Now you can use alexa to tell IFTTT to close the garage door, but you cannot use it to set up automation to open the door when you get home for example. Nor are there any useful features in the MyQ app aside from maybe setting it on a schedule. Which might work for me if I got off work at a consistent time every day, but I don't want my garage door opening at a specific time that I predict I might get home, only to have it sit open for a couple of hrs because I had to work overtime.If you want to pay $50 to be able to remotely open and close your garage from the MyQ app on your phone, then this is for you. If you want to integrate it with your exiswting smarthome I would suggest looking into other options. It does say it integrates with Google Home which might be helpful, but as I don't have a google home I can't test it's usefulness.",1,1,2019-6-20,1,3,0
"Let me start with the cons: works great, easy setup, customer service was friendly on the phone when I called.Pros: the loud unnecessary repetitive warning sound that this product emanates is extremely unbearable, it's exhausting. Therefore, it's the only reason why I am returning it tomorrow. There is no way to shut it off (tried black electrical tape over the openings, but no success). The customer service rep told me that due to regulations, all models came with this undesireable sound, that starts about 10 seconds before the door closes, during closing, and at least 10 seconds after the door has closed completely.

"MyQ garage door opener is a great tool to open and close your garage door using a smart technology. Gone are the days when you leave home and wonder if you have closed the garage door. The packaging and build of the product is quite nice. The main unit is light and use to connect using the myQ app. The wall mounting of the hub needed better instructions and mechanism - it took me more than 20 minutes to wall mount it. The wireless sensor is easy to connect to the app. Once the main device is connected to WiFi, you are in good control of your garage door from anywhere with internet access ( using the app).The app interface is very helpful; you can also review history and schedule opening and closing. You can allow 2 guests to use the app. You can also control via Google voice assistant which I have not tried yet.",4,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"After a couple of months of use and tweaking, I have pretty much given up on this product.  Initial installation went pretty well, other than taking about 3 hours to get it to connect to my opener so it would open and close the door.  I had to turn off all the garage lights and work in the dark to get the initial connection to work.  I would estimate the actual open/close function works around 40% of the time.  Otherwise, the controller will light up, but it won't open or close the door.  I decided not to return, as the sensor telling me the whether the door was open or closed worked well and that was helpful to me.  Well, over the last couple weeks (after the return window is closed), that function has decided to go wonky as well. I get notifications that the door was left open for an hour, when it is closed.  I have absolutely no confidence in looking at the app whether my garage door is actually closed or open like it says.  Love the idea of this product, and if it worked as intended all the time, I would love it.  It would be more understandable if the wifi coverage was weak in the garage area, but I do have a mesh wifi system in my house that has very strong coverage in the garage.  Left with a product that will occasionally allow me to open the garage door with my phone, and nothing else.  Very disappointed.",1,1,2019-8-26,1,1,0
"I do not have an Alexa so that is the reason for the low review of that. I wish there was a N/A option for that one.Installation of the hardware was easy enough, but setting up the app and configuration of the hub was not as easy. I am an IT storage professional, so very familiar with setting up hardware/software/appliances. I was not able to use my newer HTC cell phone to complete the setup. It kept having issues with WiFi. My older Google Nexus 6 worked like a charm. Good thing I had a second cell phone to use.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"My wife and I purchased the MyQ Wireless & Wi-Fi Garage Hub to use with our iPhones. I started the initial setup while she was gone and everything seemed to be going OK until she got home.  She couldn't connect her iPhone to it through her own email account.  She had to use my email account.  She didn't understand why Chamberlain is dragging their feet on being able to set up the app using two different email accounts.  We can do it with our Arlo cameras.  The system seems to work pretty well.  There is a delay of one minute minimum to send a signal to our router so it can alert our iPhones so it is NOT instantaneous.  You need to go into NOTIFICATIONS (under the Chamberlain app) if you have an iPhone and your opener is Chamberlain to make sure your alerts are turned on.  The little box that gets stuck with Velcro to your garage door had a little rattling sound to it when shaken like something was broken and loose inside.  After a little thought, I'm pretty sure it is a ""dangly"" level that senses when the garage door is closed making the sensor vertical or when it is open making it horizontal.  Overall, we are happy with it, at least so far. Just an update since we have installed the MyQ. It works as advertised. I thought I would be alerted whenever the door was opened or closed and I am. However, it is NOT instantaneous. The lowest setting of notifications is 1 minute so the door has to be open or shut for one minute in order to be notified on my iPhone. One thing that I would like to see Chamberlain change is the HISTORY. I would like to be able to select the events that I want to delete. Instead, you must delete ALL of the history. Other than that, we are very happy with the item.",4,1,2018-11-29,1,2,0
"We purchased this product because we often left the home wondering if we forgot to close the garage (even though we almost always did) and wanted a way to check and close the garage remotely.This smart garage hub was extremely simple to install. I had to be a little creative in making sure it had power (see picture with short extension cord that now feeds both my opener and the myQ hub), but otherwise it was an easy as hanging a picture.

That one wouldn't stay connected to Wifi even though I installed a dedicated access point in the garage for it.  And every time it lost connection, I had to reestablish it manually.  But that's another review.I'm giving this 5 stars because so far (2 weeks ish), the MyQ does what it claims to do well.  As far as the connection, if it's ever lost the wifi connection, the MyQ has no problem reestablishing it on it's own as it's always been available when I've opened the app.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
"This product has saved me so many trips from turning the car around to go check if I’ve closed the garage door. The app is user friendly and notifies you of when the garage door was Open/closed last.For install: Plan to reserve about 25-30 minutes of your time. When you open the box, instructions will walk you step by step through install and where to place the sensors and hub. There’s even videos to watch for further explanation. I think the hardest part was trying to identify which garage door motor unit we had and we had to go through set up a couple of times until we selected the right one (the color of the button was faded on our garage door motor and hard to determine which one it matched with in the app).  Make sure you don’t have any other Bluetooth devices around while trying to install, so you have a clear signal. If you don’t have a strong WiFi connection, you will have issues trying to set this up and use it in the future.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,1
"Overall, I do like this product.  For about $40, I can add wifi-enabled remote control from my smartphone.  Installation was a breeze -- it took about 10 minutes from start to finish slowly following the instructions and videos provided within the app that I had to download (in my case, from the Apple Appstore).  Instructions and videos were very, very clear.  The app required me to register for an account with my email address and a password to run the software -- my iphone automatically logged me into the app when I open it, but it would have been annoying if my phone didn't do that as the app only allows control of the garage door remote hub if the user is logged into his/her account.Once everything was installed, registered and logged in, the app displayed the status of my garage door (""open"" or ""closed""), and it allowed me to open or close the garage door with two taps:  one tap to change the status to an actual command button, and then a second tap to follow through with the open or close command.  The open action happened relatively quickly after the command; the close action was heralded with the hub flashing its light and beeping for several seconds to warn of the garage door closing before the door started to close.",4,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"I understood from the Amazon display that this was easily integrated into the Alexa environment. I was also led to believe that this would allow Amazon delivery inside my garage, thereby removing the temptation from porch pirates. Not true.  I also understood that this device would let me know when my garage door was opened. thinking that I could eliminate my own forgetfulness this would be a great device,  Not True!  So we are back to my original question and headline, Why did I buy this?  In fairness to the device, it does behave as designed. it does send out a notice when the garage door is opened and a signal when it is closed. Fair enough. Maybe I didn't think this out thoroughly enough before buying it.  It tells me when the garage door is opened, well duh, I just opened it so I could drive my car out.  Maybe I wanted something to tap me on the shoulder a few minutes later, maybe ten or fifteen asking me why the door was still opened.  Yeah, that's what I wanted.  Well it does not do that. It does not link to Amazon Alexa easily. You need to jump through a couple of hoops before that may happen and that is with a technology called ifttt which is short for ""if this, than that"" .  At that point in time I was not ready for what I thought were silly games to make something work and sent it back.  Since then, I am learning that ifttt can be used for all sorts of things with Alexa. That is up to you to discover. This review is only about this garage door opener / notification device.  Biggest complaint of all was the instructions, or lack thereof! In addition, once you found the instructions on the internet, possible that what you find is not totally correct.  Bottom line, a device that could be very useful brought to market by Chamberlain, known for their excellent garage door openers, half heartedly brought to market by a marketing team that apparently could care less. If I brought a product to market like that a  few years back I would be out on the street looking for a new job.",2,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"So far so good.  First off, the first one didn’t work (or we programmed it wrong) but Amazon sent a replacement and my husband was able to install it and get it working right away.  I guess I don’t understand why people are complaining about the cost.  There’s only a cost if you want to connect to Google Assistant or other Home automation apps.  Just use the app by itself.  It really does work great and you can set all different kinds of alerts.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve returned home just to see if I closed the garage and I’m so excited to be able to look in the history and it says “Garage Door Closed at ...”  what a blessing!",5,1,2018-9-16,1,4,0

It truly saved me lots of time and trouble organizing a friend who would come to the house and open the garage door for the repair team. In the meantime I have installed four MyQ on all my garage doors on my two homes. The App is very well designed. I can see all four garage doors on one screen.

It is also Still missing smartthings integration, so my garage doors are controlled through this other app.  Was also disappointed during setup that I was having so many problems with setup.  I would recommend that you do not mount ANY piece of the system until you have it completely set up.

Edit 2020 noticed my review was cut off.Opens your garage door during a tornado because it thinks it's open.  This isn't cool.  We setup 2 alerts.  One to at 9pm to alert us if it was open and another one at midnight to close if shut.  Tornado sirens went off at around 11:45 and or was very very windy.  I got my wife and kid and headed to the basement.  As we were settling down we heard the garage door open??? I had to go upstairs and close it because the app was useless.  The app said there was a malfunction and it thought the door was open.  The sensor was mounted properly and was within range of the box.  Called support and they blamed it on a dead battery and told me to replace it.  They refused to provide any other assistance in resolving the issue.

When we walk the dogs, we go into the car and grab a car remote - the old number pad we had outside got flaky so took it down.

Synced up immediately. shows if door is open or closed (as well as the camera I have in my garage). Set up an alert to show when the door opens that sends a push notification. So, if we leave the house, and forget to close the door, no more driving back to close it.

"Bought because of price point, functionality and manufacturer.  Price point; under $50.  Functionality; if your garage door opener motor  has a “learn” button on the back (regardless of color (it should work, check out my picture for location and what it looks like; mine is purple). As for MFG; chamberlain is well respected in garage doors.  If you have WI-FI arhat reaches into your garage (use you cell phone to check; it should work), if you have a spare opening on the power plug that your garage door motor is plugged into, it should work.  So make sure you have a Lear button on your opener, Wi-Fi reaches the garage, you have power within 6 feet of the garage motor. A critical requirement is to mount the MYIQ hub  (the bigger box that is (in my picture) mounted to the ceiling) within 6 feet of the motor.  This is necessary for it to reliable send commands to your garage door motor to open or close a door! If you are going to install this for two door garage (as in my picture) you will need to buy a second sensor and ensure that you find a sweet spot between the two motors that is no more than 6 feet from either motor; else buy two MYIQ hubs while they are on sale;  it’s only a $10 difference from buying two door sensors.

"Want to push a button on your phone and have the garage door open? It does this flawlessly.  Want to integrate with Alexa or have the doors open and close as you arrive or leave... well... at least for me, that is far from flawless. The MyQ Alexa app doesn't exist anymore, you have to use the SimpleCommands app to bridge MyQ to Alexa and it isn't 100% flawless. The Alexa integration allows me to tell her to open and close the garage doors and it does give me Amazon Key functionality, which is nice, but the location-based control is very hit or miss. For me, it works sometimes, but I can't depend on it at all. I don't dare just drive away and assume the door will close. I always have to check the MyQ app and if it closes, cool, if not, I have to press the button... which is kind of cool, it is like having an infinite range garage door opener, but still, the point it automation, not infinite range.I'm glad I got it, it controls both my double door opener (1994 model) and my single door controller (2016 model) equally well (had to purchase a 2nd sensor).

I don't know if they hung up on me or it was accidental, but I was never called back.  Meanwhile, I FINALLY figured out how to do a factory reset, re-initialized the sensors (Pull the battery completely and replace it.)  I got everything working and remounted the hub, and the 2nd garage wouldn't work.  So I had to reposition the hub hallway between the openers and figure how to power it.

The app itself guides you through the install with in-line videos and step by step instructions.  I paired the head unit with my wi-fi network and the door sensor in the house, then unplugged and installed everything in the garage.  My garage is abt 60 feet from my wifi router in the house, it connected instantly with no problem.  You have to use 2.4 ghz wifi, not 5.0.  2.4 has longer range.  You have to pair the head unit with 3 things, in this order:",5,1,2019-1-5,1,1,0
"I have two garage doors. So, I bought the smart hub and an extra sensor from Amazon. I considered getting Nexx Garage at first since, it had better reviews on Amazon. But I went with Chamberlain for ease of installation and setup. According to the Chamberlain both of my openers (LiftMaster 8500 & Wayne Dalton iDrive) seemed compatible or that's what I thought. The installation was easy however, setup was not.It turned out that LiftMaster 8500 didn't have a program/learn button that's either purple, red, yellow etc. So, I couldn't get past the step on the app where you are supposed to enter the color of the program button. I then called Chamberlain support. To my surprise, the tech support rep said LiftMaster 8500 is not going to work. I would need an additional internet gateway. This was very disappointing. I didn't want to buy another component plus this information should have been stated in the compatibility list. It clearly was not. So, I decided to return everything the next day. But before returning it, I tried few other things (I'm an engineer). One of things I tried worked and I was able to program the LiftMaster with Chamberlain after couple of hours.",3,1,2018-4-19,1,2,0
"Ordered the Smart Hub right before Christmas.. wanted to be sure all packages made it safe as the porch thieves were tracking the delivery vans in herds. Received the Smart Hub and my husband - NOT a techy at all- had the system installed, up and running within 30 minutes. Our garage door opener is approximately 10 years old so we had concerns... but there were no problems! It connected right away and we were able to sit in the living room and open and close the door just for kicks! We only connected it to one door, given we ordered it specifically for Amazon deliveries. Sitting at work I am notified when husband opens and closes the door! Haha.Now, when we order, there is an added option for ""garage delivery"" and we simply choose that. It was SO nice to be away for the week after Christmas and to get notified there was a package coming, be notified the door was opening, and one minute later notified the door was closing; and when we arrived home our Amazon package was sitting safely inside our garage. PERFECT SOLUTION!",5,1,2019-12-31,1,1,0
"I tried to install the My Q but it did not work with my new garage door opener. This opener acts as a remote opener just like the opener you keep in your vehicle, instead of wiring directly in to the unit like the switch mounted to the wall of your garage. Because of the security measures employed by newer openers (rolling codes, encryption, etc.) the MyQ is not compatible with many newer model garage door openers. Frankly, I think it's a bad design and leaves the opener incompatible with many units from all manufacturers, and that will only get worse as garage door manufacturers add more security features. If you have a newer opener, try the Gogogate 2. It works flawlessly with my opener manufactured in 2018.",1,1,2018-12-7,1,3,0
"The product looked great and for the money was very reasonable.  Once I attempted to install using the app on my phone, ran into issues  trying to connect to the hub.  Decided to switch to using my pad, and then then I was able to establish initial communications to the hub so that I could tell it what wifi network to connect to and enter the password.  After that the installation went smooth by following the step by step install instructions on the app.  So everything worked after the initial install.  The 2 garage doors I installed opened and closed from my phone app.  The next day I tried to open the doors, no response.  The doors were unresponsive.  When to the hub and the green light was solid (Which I think means it is connected to the wifi network).  The app showed no issues with communications to the hub, nor did it report any other problems.  It just didn't work.  Manually I opened the garage door and I did not receive any change of status for the garage door being open.  I decided to cycle power to the hub, surprisingly no message of the hub being disconnected or anything was wrong.  Not too impressed with this being an home automation product.  Another negative is I could not find a skill that would connect to the MyQ and allow control of the garage through Alexa.  You can connect using the Amazon Key for deliveries, but I didn't want to use that.  Overall I would not recommend this product.",2,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"There is nothing not to like.Installation is simple as long as you have a good WiFi signal.  The app (I have an iPhone) is clean and the response time, considering it has to go to the Chamberlain servers via the internet, before going back to my home server to the WiFi, is pretty good.  Select the remote command - only the appropriate one OPEN or CLOSE, is available - and the door begins to move within 3 or 4 seconds.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
Had it installed and working in less than 25 min. And I am a 66 year old woman. Hardest part was getting the ladder off the wall and moving it to where I needed it. Seems to be working just fine. The alarm sound however is SO ANNOYING. I really see no reason for it. All standard garage door openers don't have alarms. That is why they have the sensors so in the event someone stupidly walks under the door when it is closing it will stop and reverse. That function still works with the MyQ. So absolutely NO reason for the annoying alarm. I also wish it would integrate with Alexa. Overall an excellent purchase for the money.,4,1,2019-11-25,1,2,0
"First of all, credit where credit is due. I've had this installed for a week and it's working very well. The installation was very smooth, probably the smoothest of any home automation product I've ever used. I didn't have to think at all during setup. Physical installation might have been challenging if I had mounted the hub on the ceiling as recommended (would have required a 12-foot ladder) but I just rested it on top of the garage fridge and it works fine.Having said all that, anyone purchasing this thing should know in advance that even though they tout integration with Amazon Key (a useless feature for me), there is absolutely zero integration with Alexa. Chamberlain decided at some point to nickle and dime their customers by charging $1 / month for the great privilege of controlling their stupid little device with standard home automation techniques. For example, you can control it with Google Home, but only if you shell out $1 / month. And you can't use Alexa AT ALL. So I can't pull into my driveway and tell Echo Auto to open the garage door, which would be a natural and smooth implementation. Instead, I have to open my phone, open the app, wait for authentication, and click the button in the app before the door will open.",3,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
"It is easy to install with wireless connection between both the door unit and the controller mounted to the ceiling.  However, Chamberlain and their garage door app MyQ was removed from Alexa skills due to their requirement to pay a yearly fee for the privelege of having their Oh So Fantastic garage door opener.  I returned mine and decided to settle on Nexx Garage.  It takes a little more work to run the wiring and mount the sensor but easily doable for most DIY folks.  Nexx Garage app has been working flawlessly and after downloading IFTT I can simply say ""Alexa close the garage door"" and the door closes within a few seconds.",1,1,2019-5-27,1,3,0
"To make the door smart, you need to install a battery-powered puck on your door. The battery lasts about a month.The puck must be paired to the hub.

"Would give 5 stars as it is a great product and does what I bought it for. However to utilize with Alexa you must pay for the service, very minimal cost but the fact that I can’t have my echo device open my garage door and must get my phone, open the app, then click on the “open” garage door is quite a bit more time consuming.",4,1,2020-8-8,1,3,0
"Received the MYQ-G0301.  There is no step by instruction in the box. You download the app to your smartphone Myq and it walks you through the setup step by step.  The instruction is very clear.  It did take several tries to connect to my wifi network.  Once it did connect it ran okay in the continued setup until sync to the door opener motor, again it took several tries of pushing the learn button before it syncs with the motor.  Other than two items the setup was very easy.There is a warning sound when the door is starting to close and continues until after the door is shut.  Guess this is good as you are not there to actually see that no one is standing in the way of the closing",4,1,2019-11-18,1,1,0
"Love this product which allows my older garage door opener to be smart.  I can open/close the garage with the use of my iPhone and it tells me the status of the door anytime and how long it had been at that state.  You have the option to have it automatically close at a certain time of the day to. It also integrates w/ Amazon Key App which gives you the option to have them deliver your package inside the garage, safe from thieves. Amazon will actually g I've you $30 for the 1st delivery using the Key App, making this purchase almost FREE.  This also integrates with the Brinks Home Security System for Free but I opted out of that to start out with because I will need MyQ to delete the serial # from their system and remove the app from my iPhone before Brinks can add it to their system.  I want to make sure Amazon's Key App will still work with the Brinks app before implementing it.Installation was pretty easy except for one step that the myq app bypassed  (the pairing) so I had to call support &we just deleted it & restarted.  Support was outstanding.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,1
I tried a different remote opener system and returned it because it didn't work with my MyQ compatible door opener. I decided to try to see if I could get control of both my old school and smart garage door openers. This thing works great!PROs:,5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"Great product, by a quality company.  I have wanted to add this to my garage for 2 years, didn't think I would be able to since I didn't own one of the chamberlain products.  When I saw this I thought it was capable of being added to any opener.  I found out that I couldn't add to my Horman opener.  I recently came across some used lift master add on remote units for upgrading older openers to the new remotes.  I added the liftmaster units to my openers and programed them to the MyQ hub and installed and programed in the door position sensor and she works like a charm.My only complaint so far is it doesn't respond to my phone sometimes when I am backing out.  Could be my wifi signal not sure.  But it is nice when coming home I can open it out in the street and by the time I get to the garage the door is open.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0
"This product is absolutely garbage. Stay away!We have a smart home. Lights, thermostats, cameras, the works. I build computers for fun. This product does not work. Worse, it actively breaks the baseline functionality of the normal remote control openers.",1,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"This solved a BIG problem for us: Did we or didn't we close the garage door when we drove away? Facing the street on the driveway (backing in) and using the car's remote, we always THOUGHT we knew but were sometimes NOT SURE and had to drive back home! Sometimes open, sometimes closed. Now we don't have to worry! So I've substituted constantly checking the app for worrying...!Actually, this went in very very simply - and will for you IF you already have the following: an open power plug on the ceiling next to or very near to you CURRENT COMPATIBLE GARAGE DOOR OPENER MOTOR!  A power drill to drill a couple of holes in your garage ceiling. Safety glasses! A 5/32 drill bit (or close...I used a 9/64, good enough). A ladder.

"I purchased this because indoor delivery via my front door would set off my Ring alarm. I was hoping Amazon would integrate indoor delivery with Ring since they own the company. Even though I didn't mind a delivery person having access to my front door only when a delivery is made, I still prefer having it placed in the garage. I also like being able to remotely open or close my garage.The installation and setup were easy and the instructions were more than sufficient. I chose to install the hub on a beam in my garage because I had an injured left arm and couldn't reach up that high. I placed the door sensor to line up with the hub and they are within a couple feet of each other when the garage door is open.",3,1,2019-11-16,1,0,1
"I don't write a lot of reviews but the main reason I wrote this review is because so many of the other reviews say nothing but negative things (ad nauseum) about the condition of the box or the condition of the product and about how it was so hard to install or that it took so much longer than it should have, or that it didn't work with their existing Wi-Fi or that it didn't do this or that, or they were complaining about the beeper and on and on and on.  I don't care for the beeper either but I don't ever hear it because I'm not there when I'm using the app to close the garage door!  Isn't that the point-- to be able to open and close the garage door remotely?  Let me tell you I had the unit up and running in no time.  True there were no printed instructions but the PHONE app which you should install before you do anything walks you right through it, simple step by step.  I hit no snags during the installation and even the hollow wall anchors went in correctly and I'm usually the type that has lots of trouble with those things!And on top of this I bought a used (listed as very good condition) product at a fraction of the price of the new one...

"If you are thinking about purchasing this, please read this!First, I was looking at this for my somewhat older opener model.  However, after a few hours of research and testing I found out my opener already had this built in!  It does not have WiFi enabled but it has the MyQ signal logo on the side.  Upon learning this, all I needed was the Smarthub to plug into my router to make it compatible with HomeKit.  If you have a similar set up or desire, all you need is the module that plugs into your router for Alex, Google assistant, etc.  However, if you do not have this tech then this is your solution.",3,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"Very easy to install and set up.  Wish they offered a 2 garage pack as an option as well.  I had to buy a 2nd MyQ box for my 2nd garage door, but overall I am very happy with the product.This product is great for use, especially with Vivint.  They just recently integrated it with their system and it has been so easy to use and monitor with having kids who leave garage doors open.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"We primarily got this to know whether we left our garage door open when leaving the house and when we go on long trips we get OCD on whether we left it open and have to turn around to double check. This product does absolutely great with showing up whether the door is open or closed as well as giving notifications when the door is open or closed. The problem we have had so far is once we are off out wifi network on our phones the doors does not respond to the open / close command. It has worked maybe twice since we had it. The unit and senor are both locating within 1 1/2 feet one one another when the door is open and probably 5'-6' when it's closed. wifi shows a very strong signal. I will walk our dog in the morning and when walking back I will press the ""open"" function from the app on my phone to test it. We are only about .1 mile away when I do. It just goes in circles as though it's trying to connect to the unit and open the door. It times out about every time and I try again to no avail (except a couple times). Yesterday it even came back with a ""timed out"" message saying there were too many failed attempts to connect and the only way to reset it was to be at the hours and control the door from the wall unit in our garage or the remote control on our car or the handheld unit. But the main purpose we got it was to tell if/when our door is open/closed so that's why the 3 star rating. The ability to actually open / closed through the App when off our home wifi is another story.",3,1,2019-8-8,1,1,0
"I should have listened to the bad reviews on this product.  I haven't been able to use any of the devices I purchased on my garage since I haven't been able to get past the app installation, which is atrocious.  I had to use FIVE different email accounts to try to set up an account, and even then, I still haven't been able to set up an account.  I enter all my information but never received a confirmation email to allow me to finish setting up my account on any of the emails I used.  I checked every single folder on each of the emails but didn't get a single email from them.  I contacted support and was on with them for over an hour and they weren't able to solve my issue.  Instead, they told me to contact google since they didn't have a server down and their emails must be getting blocked.  WHAT?!  I used a google email, yahoo email, outlook email, iCloud email and NONE of them worked so how can it be that every single one of those providers on different apps and websites isn't allowing your emails to come through?  Yes, this is cheaper than most other options but the app, setup, customer service, and just about everything for this product is a joke.",1,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"So many mixed reviews. Are people not following directions? Likely. Do people have a weak signal in their garage? Good possibility. Should some people not be allowed around technology? Definitely! I was hesitant after the mixed reviews. But there's something to be said for over ten thousand positive reviews and number one bestseller. I also like the idea of a wired button and magnetic contact switch that others have over the ""this is just another remote"" approach the MyQ uses. However, there's also something to be said for a simpler install, portability, fewer wires, and cleaner looking.Just as others have said, follow the instructions. That's the best advice I can give you. If reading comprehension is not your strength, why are you reading reviews? Hire a handyman. The whole setup, and installation, was very quick and easy. If you can hang a picture, you can do this! I did not attempt to integrate with Amazon Alexa, Google, or ITTT. My new car does not have a Home Link mirror, so no remote. I didn't want an ugly clicker on my visor, and just something to leave behind in a rental car/truck. I've always got my phone, and if I didn't I couldn't close the garage until I ran in and grabbed it! Not to mention how many times did I already arm the alarm, but not yet check the garage door? A lot! how many times was the door left open all night? Even once is too many. How many times did I drive away and wonder, did I leave the door open? I see no mention of monthly fees for my install, and I did set up alarms in case the door was left open or did not close properly. I love the idea of turning my garage into my own Amazon Locker! How many times have I worried about packages on the porch? The whole install consists of two pieces of velcro and two drywall anchors with screws. The setup of the whole system was installing an App and pressing two buttons. If that frightens you, hire a handyman, or buy your neighbor a beer. As for that super loud, extremely annoying door close alarm that bothers the neighbors, perhaps they've toned it down. It beeps and a little LED light flashes. That's all there is to it. A power failure messes it up? I had it plugged into the wall for the setup, and disconnected it and moved everything for the final install. Nothing was lost. An extended power outage may be a different story, but how often does that happen? The device loses connectivity? Not that I have seen so far. Perhaps it's time to invest in a better router or access point? Chamberlain's support was/was not helpful? Chamberlain's support was not necessary. The device takes too long to respond. If nearly instantly is too long. My wife likes a clean garage. That means almost nothing is stored in the garage. Certainly nothing of value. But that also means this device received approval for it's clean, simplistic, nice looking install. Her words were, ""Very nice."" I'm happy. The wife is happy. What more could you want? I hope I've addressed all your concerns. Reading comprehension, hire a handyman or buy your neighbor a beer. That's really all there is to it.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,1
"I spent days trying to setup this device. I read what I could find here and online (thanks to user Steve for all his tips). I also contacted Chamberlain support. The sticking point was that I could never get beyond the WiFi setup, using my iPhone. The device would seem to connect to WiFi, but the setup would not continue. I tried an iPad -- no-go. I tried an old WiFi access point, configured just for this device. Still no joy. Finally, I dug out an old Android phone. Finally! Using the Android app, I was able to go through the setup of the WiFi connection, effortlessly.So, lesson learned -- use or borrow an Android phone to setup this device. The iOS app will not work well for initial setup, if at all. The iOS app works great once the system is setup and you have an account established. And, using a static IP address (configured on my router), I have not had the device go offline from my WiFi since initial setup.",3,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"I rediscovered this product while browsing the Amazon Black Friday deals.  When I originally found this product, I decided not to buy it mainly because in order to use it with my voice assistants (Alexa or Google) I had to pay a reoccurring subscription.

"So when I got this I had high hopes. For me, it was not difficult to set up but I did read a bit at the problems others were having before doing it, but honestly, setup was easy. The problem for me that showed up very quickly was the door sensor. Very early on, it did not seem to know if the door was open or closed. I called Chamberlain, and to their credit, and they sent out a new sensor, which within a 2 weeks did the some thing. To be fair, I did not contact them again as I figured this was what causes this item to have average reviews This is on me but I suspect it is a problem with the product line. Here is the problem-if you use this as a remote access for your door and the sensor malfunctions, you could end up with your garage door being open when you are not there. Honestly, I do not even use it anymore. Half the time it says the door is open when it isn't and vice versa. Anyway, there are really no features much that this offers in my opinion as compared to the chance you take of having your garage door being wide open with nothing you can do about it. I have a lot of smart devices around my home-smart switches, smart light bulbs, smart plugs, Alexa, Arlo Cameras, Ring Cameras, etc. They all work together really well. This is in the other category-I would not buy it again.",2,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"One, do yourself a favor and get the bundle with the little Wi-Fi extender, so you can be rest assured that you have adequate coverage in your garage.  Seriously, don't cheap out; it's only like ten dollars more. Secondly, if you've had installation problems on this, you should just go back to owning a flip phone, black and white TV, Sony Walkman (the cassette type), 8-track player, or Betamax, as clearly high tech is not for you.  Since, I live in Wisconsin, and it was 9 degrees, I set up the Wi-Fi extender in the house, before journeying to my detached garage.  Once you have the wifi extender setup, you can move it wherever you want.  I went out to the garage and plugged the little extender in, waited for both blue lights to be solid, then moved onto the myQ device. Setup could not be easier, and I didn't even do things in the order that they ask you to in the instructions.  Begin with the DOOR CLOSED. I did this anyway since it was freezing cold, but apparently that's what's expected anyway. I found an unoccupied outlet above waist level, mounted the hub bracket with my 1/4 inch hex driver, slid the hub on the bracket, then plugged it in. The app walks you through the process at like a third grade understanding level.  A couple of flashes, and button presses, and the door sensor and hub were paired. Reached up and hit the ""learn"" button, and the app and hub synced that in like another 45 seconds. It opened up the door.  I stepped out of the garage and hit the little garage looking icon on my screen, and 10-15 seconds later, light was flashing, alert was sounding, and door closed. It's literally not even a one beer job; guys you know what I'm talking about...  Had my wife been home at the time, I probably would have spent more time checking the Bleacher Report and/or ESPN app, but she wasn't, so I digress.  So, point being, unless you are a baby-boomer, it's easy peasy lemon squeezy (sorry dad; the thing that looks like a paper clip in your email is an attachment, and the thing that looks like a paper airplane, on your snooty iPhone, that you don't know how to use, is the messaging send icon).",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0

Was pleasantly surprised to find that it showed the status and offered an intuitive way to finish the installation (learning the opener's RF code).

"The installation is a bit of a chore, but it actually works. My first attempt at connecting my old Raynor Pilot garage door opener online was the Nexx Garage. Unfortunately the magnet sensor was too finicky for my 1990's-era 8'-ft sectional garage door, and it would not align properly half the time. This MyQ uses a clever tilt sensor which doesn't care how much slop there is in the door tracks.The MyQ tilt sensor has a wireless connection to the hub, while the Nexx needed a wired magnet sensor at the top of my door. The tilt sensor uses a CR2450 coin cell for power. Both of mine lasted about 6 months before the hub sent me notifications via the MyQ app that the battery was low and needed to be replaced soon. One of them kept working for almost 2 weeks before I installed a new battery.",4,1,2019-12-1,1,0,1
"I was really excited about this device. A few days after installation, we went out of town. The person taking care of the house called in a panic that the garage door was open.  I checked the app and sure enough, the garage door had opened itself. After this happened a couple of times, I found how to set up notifications so I would know when this happened. It wasn’t too bad because I was able to close it remotely. The last couple of times it happened, I was notified but then the unit would not close (too many attempts, then disconnected from WiFi) and the app told me to close the door locally. I wasn’t home which is why I need this product. Last night, it happened again and I had to leave my post at work to close the garage door where my family was sleeping (I work nights and no one heard their phones). This product is dangerous and has put my family and home at risk by opening spontaneously about once a week. The device losing connection with the WiFi after the alert and just telling me to close the door locally was of no value. I ran home during my shift to close the door and unplug it.

I believe that during the winter, snow and ice build up and get in the way of the garage door closing causing the garage door to pop back up.  I have an Xfinity home security system which alerts me to when the garage door stays open for more than 5 minutes.  But it is a pain to have to drive back to close the garage door.I have been wanting a product like this for a while and when I found it on sale, i definitely had to give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  The installation took me about 20 minutes and the MyQ app I had installed on my Iphone, provided me all the guidance I needed.

The price for myQ Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain MYQ-G0301 - Wireless & Wi-Fi enabled Garage Hub has finally come down to a reasonable price making them worthwhile solutions by adding phone App convenience.PROS:,4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,1
Troubleshooting with Chamberlain was a mess but the word is this: WPA3 is not supported on this MyQ product with the firmware it has on it when it ships.In speaking with support for several hours on two separate occasions we finally identified that if you use Eero Pro and have enabled WPA 3 it will not work.,2,1,2020-9-30,1,1,0
"I have been looking for a smart garage door solution, but hesitated on this one because some of the reviews say that there will be a paid subscription to make it work. When the price came down below $30, I decided to give it a try, and I am happy with it!The installation was easy. I downloaded the myQ app on my phone, and followed the step-by-step instructions from the app. Basically you attach a door sensor with velcro stickers, and the wireless hub to the wall (or ceiling) with screws. The whole process took 10 - 15 mins. Now I can check the status of the my garage door on my phone. I can open and close the door remotely with my phone.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

"I already had a Z-Wave garage door controller, but it was not controllable by Alexa and didn't support Amazon Key. The MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener does at least support* Amazon Key. Unfortunately Amazon Key is not available in my area, so minor flop. If this is important to you, check Amazon's supported areas before you purchase.My existing controller closed a physical switch to send the ""Open/Close"" command to the opener. Imagine my intense concern when the only wired connection to this device is for power. I had checked my opener for compatibility before I purchased the controller, so I thought I must have made some kind of mistake. After packing it back into the box, I did some research on the installation of MyQ and discovered it uses the same RF signal as a typical transmitter.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"Bought two of these for my two garage doors. Used the same hub for both. When I initially installed these they both worked fine, while in the garage. The one closest to the hub would only work occasionally, like after a manual open.In my troubleshooting, I recognized the sensor farther from the hub worked 100% of the time. I understand LED/florescent lights might cause a problem, but that wasn't the case in my shop - tried it with them on and off with no difference in operation or notification to my phone. I considered the battery might be weak in the closest one, but they sensors were likely the same age. I noticed I had the hub oriented with the power connection towards the closest sensor. So I turned the hub facing the sensor and, so far, that seems to have resolved my issue.",4,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0

MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain MYQ-G0301  work for me everything is great. Make sure its 2.4ghz wifi you don't need 5.4ghz to tell it open and close didn't try but I don't think it will work. straight to the point of my review is the main reason I got this is notification my garage door is open. Our garage door remote doesn't have a cover for the open and close button so it can accidentally press open by dropping it. Anything like stuff in the bag could press it if bag was move around. That what happen luckily our neighbor was outside notice Garage door was open and our dogs ran out around the into the street. Garage door was open for few minute people could have taken our garage stuff my tools our random garage stuff some valuable stuff. My face id Iphone sometime doesn't like me that would help you login quicker. You can set up when you get closer to the garage door when your driving your car. I personal have not try that yet I can see some situation problems with that me walking around the house doing gardening. Everything working for me Have try other features so that the my short review. This last part I don't think this apply to most haha I think my Garage Door Opener has dead light bulb need to be switch out. I think most garage door have a light buib. At night it can get pretty dark and I can not see a thing. I sometime I come home pretty late moving grocery from the outside and my light switch near the inside house door. I have walk in the dark garage that sometime can get messy from doing work. Just to get to my light switch which is not safe. Yes I know I have my phone flash light so I wish there was some way I can connect MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain MYQ-G0301 to my garage light. I think there is a way i look it up latter. I know I can open it up do modification my garage door opener with smart switch or get separate smart switch for my light making it into one operation.  I do have a bit dent on garage door this happen before we got the house. The garage seem like drunk person tap their car on garage door so now it sometime doesn't close properly. playing with setting help fix it. Sometime it would reopen. I have to press it twice without changing a thing to close it. Maybe getting setting just right would fix it but I know for my family we shouldn't wireless open garage door without someone being home and have to watch the garage door close before leaving. it might hit ground and reopen. But that just be my damage garage door and not MyQ Garage devices. it would show you an error on MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener and you can't do anything to tell it try close again. I even try login  again hoping give me another chance to close garage door nope same message. well sometime think it did. maybe there was an update not sure. The error it tell to use physical button that it was install with garage door. If I wasn't home there no way for me to do that if I did wireless open it for Delivery which I don't just an example to explain the problem. I will update if I discover anything new. Overall good working product.,5,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0
"I’d get this again in a heartbeat. But know that it won’t work with Siri or HomeKit unless you want to pay an additional $60+ For the Cambridge homebridge hardware. It really isn’t an issue though. Just open the app and you can view or open/close your door with ease. Setup was great. I have a detached garage and ended up needing an extender to boost my signal. These are not too expensive (around $30), but I had one laying around anyway so it wasn’t an issue. If you have a more powerful router, you might now even need it. If you have an attached garage, you most likely wouldn’t need it anyway.  The set up walks you through it on your phone and doesn’t miss a beat. Very easy. Mounts super quickly too when you’re at that step. Again, I would get this again as my options were to either buy a new door opener at $400 or to get this $37 kit that would do the exact same thing. Make sure your garage door is supported. My craftsman door, which is at least 15 years old, but most likely much older, works perfect.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

"Best Prime Day deal ever! I love that we can check at any time if the garage door is open. You can also set alerts which is very helpful. This is such a great alternative to buying the latest and greatest garage door opener and thus saved us over $100. My only gripe is that once in a while I’ve tried to close the garage door using the app and it didn’t work. We finally found out if this happens it means you need to reset your router. We’ve only had to reset our router once so far and we’ve had this product for several months.Also, great things about this product is you can provide temporary access to open the garage to guests or delivery persons. I like that I can close the garage when my kids forget to close it or i can open it for them if the outside keypad isn’t working properly. Super helpful. Love it!",5,1,2019-11-8,1,1,0
"I'm probably in the minority here since both of my openers were already MyQ enabled (with the MyQ symbol on the opener case). While the MYQ-G0301-E was designed to work with compatible (post 1993) openers of any make, it will actually work with MyQ enabled ones as well. The only caveat is that there is no documentation anywhere that says this, and even the installation instructions do not take this into account. I took the plunge & bought the Smart Garage Hub after chatting with Customer Support who reassured me that my 2 Chamberlain models already had MyQ logic inside & did not require the external sensor to report open/close status correctly.Setting up the main hub was as per instructions, but because my openers were MyQ enabled, I skipped the section for the sensor installation. Instead, I needed to associate the openers to the hub, and to do that I had to pick the ""Commercial Opener"" in the device selection. The button labeling didn't exactly match my opener, but nevertheless it worked, and now I have 1 spare sensor left over! Installation time, even with a bit of trial & error, was about a 1/2 hour.",4,1,2019-9-26,1,0,1
"The installation of the myQ is extremely simple - you connect it to your Wifi network, pair the myQ to the door sensor attach the sensor to the garage door (with double-sided tape), pair the myQ with your garage door opener, and voila! I have seen other systems that require the sensor to be positioned in a specific place -- not the case here. There are step-by-step instructions in the App, as well as videos, making the installation process a breeze.In term of usage, the App is ok - you can open/close your garage door, as well as set schedules (open door from x to y) and notifications (when door is still open after e.g., 10pm). Other reviewers said that integration with IFTTT is not free but it was free for me, so Chamberlain might have changed their policy recently (which would make sense). There is no integration with Alexa but through IFTTT you can ask myQ to perform operations. The way I did it was to create an IFTTT command that closes the garage door based on an Alexa command (IF Alexa_command THEN close_the_door). By default, you need to insert the word ""Trigger"" in your Alexa command - for example ""Alexa, Trigger Close the Garage Door"", but you can create a routine in Alexa to send that command when you simply say ""Alexa, Close the Garage Door"". Please note that myQ allows commands to close the garage door but not to open it (for security reasons). With the IFTTT integration, you can also close the garage door based on your location. I also used IFTTT to switch on some lights when the garage door is opened.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"Let me say that I like and dislike this device for all of the same reasons. After watching a few Youtube videos, and reading the instructions, my first attempt at installation was successfully easy! I enjoy getting home to see potential snatch bandits could not get to my delivered goods because this device allows Amazon deliveries, to be placed inside my garage. However it is equally un-nerving to be home and see a strange truck pull into your drive way, and before you can investigate, the truck is pulling out and the driver just looks at you without speaking. Further investigation leads me to find a new package resting on the trunk lid of my car parked inside my garage. I never heard the garage door open, nor did the delivery person try ringing the bell first. So this device has its pluses and minuses. I can now allow friends or family access to the house or borrow things from me by placing them in the garage. I can operate the garage door remotely via the phone app, and the app tells me the current garage door status and approximately how long it has been since the last status change. Example: Door is Closed, for 11 hours. Now the minuses: The app doesn't tell me who, or how the door was opened or closed. Delivery persons now have access to place items into or take items out of my garage, car etc. The app doesn't say the door was opened at 10:20 am for 2 minutes then closed. With access to the garage, the door to the house from the garage is sometimes unlocked, but still protected by house alarm. Now I need to purchase and place camera's within the garage to monitor what gets placed into or removed from the garage. So although this device helps to solve some security concerns, it also introduces a few additional security concerns. I do not use Alexa so I don't honestly now how this device integrates with Alexa. Equally I am not sure if Alexa will alert me when the garage door is opened/closed or by whom. Now the App itself.. if you open the app to view the current status of your garage door. You may inadvertently open/close the garage door by just touching your phone screen, when you just wanted to check the status. There is no button within the app or clear-cut way to close the app without changing the door status. You have to either hit your back button twice, or tap your close all button to correctly close the app. However the phone App itself responds fast to open/close screen taps.  Again, My likes of this device currently out weighs my dislikes of having the device. The device does what it was intended to do, it will beep and a light will blink to let people/pets near the garage door know that the door is about to close. A great product when used properly and as intended. The included instructions where well written and easy to follow.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

"I had earlier purchased a higher rated smartphone remote control for the opener.  And quickly returned it. I was expecting something would use the learn button on the opener.

First time through with the app, the unit would not pair with my garage door opener (18 year old Genie).Once it fails to pair, the app really doesn't seem to offer an easy way to try again.

"The set up was easy and it's already told me a couple of times when my garage has been left open more than the specified amount of time, which was nice.  I've also been able to use it to remotely open/close the garage door when needed, also nice.  It claims to have support for Google Assistant, but when I went through the support documents for this, created an account on the Chamberlain site (which they are going to charge for in the future), got everything ready, when I searched for ""MyQ"" in Google Assistant, I got nothing but empty screen (I also tried other variations, including ""Chamberlain"", but no luck).I thought I'd let Chamberlain know, so I contacted their support, the suggestion from support is that this wasn't their problem, that I should contact Google and ask them why the MyQ app wasn't showing in Google Assistant, which was possibly the laziest response I've gotten from support before.  I told them that this was possibly due to a change Google made in the 3rd quarter of 2019 and that they may want to discuss with their internal development team to get this straightened away.",3,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"It was super easy to set up and I received a $30 rebate since I had a Key delivery before 4/1/20, so it was almost free. I think we should all do our part to thwart package thieves and this  is great solution for people who have a garage. You can give access securely, but inexpensively to your garage, but keep your house off limits to Prime Delivery.The image above is from my Reolink camera. I didn't buy the Amazon Cloud Camera because it is a rip off. Reolink has free cloud storage for 7 days on one camera or you can us an SD card. All security cameras have motion sensors nowadays and cost around $30. The Cloud Key Camera is close to $120, which is outrageous...That's a lot to pay just to have a camera linked to the key app. Instead, I get a Key alert on my phone from this wifi hub on my garage door. I then know the time of the delivery. I then just open my Reolink camera app and can find the footage of  the delivery if I want to view it. Pretty easy. Get this device and get Amazon Key if you want to help get rid of package thieves. The only negative I have seen is that deliveries are slower by a day, because it takes the delivery person longer to open and close your garage than it would to just set the package down. I bet this improves though, as the service expands. Love it!",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,1
"The MyQ app works great. You can check the open/closed status of your garage door and both open and close the garage door. However, if you want to geek out and try to automate things, you quickly find that you are only allowed to close the door using IFTTT or Google Home.  I corresponded with Chamberlain and was told that this was a safety feature. Chamberlain does not allow voice assistants to open the door. I though it would be neato-torpedo if the door opened automatically when me/wife arrived home but it's not to be. First world problems!

"The installation and the app-based instructions worked out really well. Note, that the inbox user manual is minimal. The functionality is also better than anticipated, probably due to my low initial expectation of the product. But there is not much to it, really.What I did not expect was that the base unit communicates wirelessly with the garage opener. I was hoping it would be wired as some of the openers have a limited number of entries, so if you have  several clickers (portable or in-car) this might be limiting.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,1,0

"Wow ... so close to being “great”. VERY loud beeping every time you close the door from the app. And it’s not like a couple warning beeps (like a smoke detector low battery warning) ... nope, it’s about 30 seconds of LOUD beeping every time. What’s the point?? This is no different than someone clicking a remote from a car pulling up the street or from inside the house when there’s no view of the garage door. That’s why there are sensors on a garage door that don’t allow it to close if something is blocking. Beeping is fine as an OPTIONAL safety precaution, but not allowing the consumer to control it is beyond poor design.If this is actually a necessary safety feature, then every garage door remote unit should be required by law to have loud warning beeps before engaging the motor. And since no such law exists (nor ever will), there is no need for this device to implement such a thing.",2,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I got this product specifically because it said it worked with IFTTT. When I went to connect it, it said it couldn’t find the door. Thinking it was a technical issue, I called the MyQ tech support. I told them that it wasn’t finding the door, then I noticed that it said “Note: close actions are not compatible with MyQ” now, I can understand this for not letting it open the door. But not allowing closing it? What other function is there? There isn’t one. And it doesn’t make sense that it’s a safety issue because if I can tell Alexa to close the door in my house, I can do the same from the app Inside my house without looking at the actual door. So this is very much false advertising that it works with IFTTT because it doesn’t. There’s only two options to a garage door: to open or close it. I understand why you wouldn’t want an Alexa with no security to be able to open the door, but not being able to close it? Then there is 0 function you can achieve with this. It makes no sense. You guys need to remove that it’s functional with IFTTT because it’s clearly not. And when I asked the technician why not, he told me it had nothing to do with MyQ and was a IFTTT function (which I don’t believe because IFTTT wouldn’t disallow it unless given an order to by The makers of MyQ.)",5,1,2019-7-18,1,1,1
"This gets a solid 3 from me.  With some software updates, I think it could easily be a 5.First off, installation was incredibly easy.  A lot of these solutions require tapping into the wires for the button on the wall.  Great for older units but not newer ones with smart panels.  This one mimicked a remote control which is pretty handy.  Instructions were great and it was like a 10 minute install in total for 2 doors.",3,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"I had to return the My Q. Just didn’t work as advertised. I had no problem installing, using the app, or connecting everything to WiFi. My main issues were with the Bluetooth door sensor and the god-awful warning alarm that blares like your house is on fire when the garage door closes.Door sensor: other reviewers have stated existing LED lighting can really interfere with Bluetooth - and they were right. The door sensor was placed correctly on the inside top of the garage door, about 15 feet from the main unit mounted on the ceiling. The pre-install pairing of the two units was flawless (when they were 3 feet apart). The farther distance once installed proved too much. No connection between them when the overhead LED lights were on. With the lights off, if worked fine. My LEDs are controlled by a motion sensor switch - which is more important to me than a dark garage. With the door sensor not connected, I could still open and close the garage door remotely with the My Q app, but I would (obviously) not get the door open or closed status and the subsequent notifications that would have been useful. According to the app, my garage door was always closed.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

"Absolute garbage, just like everything HomeLink-enabled and Chamberlain-branded. If I hadn't gotten this on a good sale, it'd be going right back. The only good thing about this item was that the directions were easy to follow and it was relatively easy to install, as it should be, since it's just a Bluetooth module that detects the state of the door to the Wi-Fi module.The device itself is decent looking, though I wish it were white so it would match better. I thought the light on it would be useful, but it turns out it just flashes along with some really annoying beeping when operating the door, and there's apparently no way to turn this off. Turns out that doesn't matter to me anyway because once I got it set up the first time, it randomly operates the garage door (i.e., closes if open or opens if closed) once every hour or two. I reprogrammed and tried again, and the issue continued. I reset it and currently, it's just an expensive sensor on my garage door with alerts to my phone, which is better than nothing, but the open/close functionality I'm leaving off until I can figure it out to not have it randomly leave my garage door open. Lots of troubleshooting says to remove anything with frequencies that could interfere with signals, but that's just not possible and not an acceptable solution anyway.",2,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0

"This was easy to install, took maybe 20 or 30 minutes and works well through the myq app but further integration is going to be hard for people that arent too savvy with smart home stuff. IFTTT is now free (at least for a limited time) so you can connect this to location services and smartthings with a little extra code written by the smartthings community. I was able to get the door to automatically close after I leave my home and automatically open when I get close to my house but it's not super reliable, but I am still doing my testing and tweaking. I am super surprised that there is no direct alexa integration through a skill but if you have smartthings you can work around the no skill for myQ by using virtual switches from smartthings in alexa. Just search google for this and you will find it.This is a nice option for the price (I got it for only 20 dollars) but if I paid full price I would be disappointed however I do plan in keeping this for now at least.",4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,1
This seems to be a great product. I have two that have been operating perfectly for three weeks now.  One in my home and another in my shop.  Installation of the first one took about 15 mins including watching the great video from Chamberlin. The second took maybe 10 mins.  I did have to reposition the hub in the shop because I didn’t follow the instructions that clearly say to place the hub away from large metal objects. I initially placed it behind a large machine because there was an unused outlet there. I had connection issues until I followed the directions and moved the hub to a more suitable location as advised by the instructions.  No problem since it was moved.My daughter and son in law have purchased one after seeing me open the house door from my Apple Watch when my keys and phone were 250’ away in the shop.  Theirs’ has worked perfectly as well.,5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Waited 2 months before reviewing to make sure none of the concerns I read in other reviews materialized.  Having read about importance of garage WiFi signal strength, I purchased the TP-Link N300 for additional $seventeen to max out the signal there - which as a bonus, increased WiFi range in my yard for using my buds while working outside.  I use the MyQ at a basic level - open/close 2 doors, with corresponding notifications, and remotely confirm doors are closed.  No schedules, etc. - my life's just not that complicated.Everything's worked perfectly following straightforward install (be sure to watch online videos which help significantly).  A couple of layers of hockey-stick tape over the crazy-screechy alarm softens it enough.  With two doors, I needed a second door mounted sensor.  During holiday sales, the entire hub/sensor combo was only $six more than the individual sensor, so I bought a second combo package and now have a backup hub for only $six.  2nd sensor synced just as smoothly as the first.  I didn't find the hub proximity to the 2 sensors as ""sensitive""  as some reviews described.  Sensors are between 8 and 10 feet away from the hub with no glitches.  I think these are a good value for the cost and effort.  Would recommend to family/friends.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"Installation was fairly easy but I had difficulty pairing the MyQ Smart Garage Hub with my 1993 Craftsman 139.53628SRT garage opener. Multiple attempts failed to pair after choosing the Green button learn option. The most helpful reviewer mentioned a maximum limit of transmitters the opener can handle so I reset the opener but the hub still did not pair. An answer to a question mentioned that he tried choosing Chamberlain instead of Craftsman and Yellow button instead of Red. I tried that and the opener light flashed a couple of times so it seemed I was making progress. Went back to choosing Craftsman but Yellow instead of Green button: still no pairing after choosing Green the light flashed a couple of times again. The green ""pair mode"" light in my garage opener turns off in about 30 seconds, so every attempt to pair I did set the garage opener to ""pairing mode"" multiple times while MyQ attempted pairing. Finally, I remembered a video at support(dot)chamberlaingroup(dot)com/s/article/Why-won-t-the-MyQ-Garage-Wi-Fi-Hub-open-or-close-my-garage-door-1484145690679#gdo-not-working  (view the video in the support article ""The Smart Garage Hub or MyQ® Garage won't open or close my garage door "" or watch the ""myQ In-App GDO Pair"" video in YouTube.

Remember to use your MyQ username & password to login at the MyLiftmaster(dot)com and set up alerts. I also added MyQ to the Amazon Key app. Note in the photos that I placed the sensor diagonally opposite the hub, but it is no more than 13ft away.

Basically, it connects as another door remote control that you can control via wifi, from anywhere.  The app tells you if the door status, open or closed, and for how long it has been that way.  You can set of a schedule from the app.  After much research, I have found that IFTTT and Simple Commands have limited to almost no integration with this device.  Alexa, at one time, could be set up to control this device with limited functions, using IFTTT or Simple Commands.  However, almost as soon as this is coded by users, it looks like Amazon comes up with an update or something that prevents this.  It is common sense that giving Alexa access to opening and closing your garage door is a security risk.  Amazon does not want to be responsible if a burglar yells, ""Alexa, open the garage door,"" through your closed windows and cleans you out.  It works will with the app and if you get a IP camera installed in your garage it works a piece of mind.  Good product but is basically stand alone at this time.  I like it though.",4,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"Update Sept. 28, 2019Rating reduced to 3 stars. I continue to be disappointed with the integration with Google Assistant so I contacted Chamberlain via phone and online chat today. The human on the phone was nice enough to tell me that the function to open the door is disabled because there is a security risk that anyone be near an open window and with a Google device nearby can say, ""OK Google, open my garage door"" and it would happen since Google cannot do voice recognition reliably enough. Fine, but state that clearly in your propaganda, Chamberlain. I received similar from a chat session with a human (I forced it out of the AI chat and to a human). That person made it very clear to me that nowhere on Chamberlain's website to they claim that MyQ and Google can OPEN the door. You can check the status and you can CLOSE the door via Google Assistant, but you cannot OPEN the door. But they don't point that out, and they should. I had never tried to close my door via Google / MyQ, but I verified today that that does indeed work.",3,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"I lost one of my garage door openers and instead of buying another one I decided to buy this so I could open the garage door from my phone.  It was a pretty easy install and everything was working fine until one day while going for a walk and I stumbled across a mother bear who was not happy with me.  She started running after me so I took off, running faster than Bruce Jenner on a Wheaties Box.  Finally I get to my house, thanking God that I have my phone to open my garage door. I open the app and boom the app didn’t have anything on it, my garage door opener wasn’t there anymore.  Luckily as soon as I crapped my pants the bear lost interest.  But after unplugging and plugging it back in it started working again, but I learned that it can’t be trusted and I always need a backup",3,1,2018-11-13,1,3,0
Pros - I installed everything in less than 5 mins.  If you can navigate a cell phone you can install this.My Deatails - I have a Liftmaster garage door opener that is less than 5 years old.  It is on a standard two car garage door,4,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"Awesome product. Have you ever driven off, got 5 blocks (or 50 miles) from your house and thought: ""Did I remember to close my garage door when I left?"". I've done that several times and had to drive back to make sure. Well, this gadget (and its' Android and Apple apps) keeps you from ever wondering about that again. The app notifies you that the garage door is closed, or if it's open because you forgot to close it. If you did, just tap the close button in the app and the door closes, no matter where you are as long as you have a signal on your phone. Plus, it gives you a time notification each time you use it. A great use I have for it is that we have to leave our little dog at home sometimes and for us, four hours is the max we want to do it. Using this we don't have to remember what time we left the house, and our dog. It's right there in the app. It is a bit of work to do the install (which is why I gave it four instead of five stars for that), but there are a couple of excellent install videos (links in the install booklet) that show you how to do it. It's been in for several months now and works flawlessly. Highly recommended.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
Think this product is Great!  I wanted it for a couple of reasons:1) My wife and I have turned around numerous times to ensure that we had closed the garage door and,5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
Had a couple false negatives in the beginning. It made my not trust it. I went out of town for a day trip and when I was on my way home. Happen to look at the app and it says my garage was open.  My neighbor says he never saw it open.  Thank goodness. But of course I was checking that nothing was missing. Alarm logs said it wasn't opened either. But the sensor suggest it was. Anyway now I have warnings through my alarmTo let me know if it was left open. Just in case. Hit close door on app and it refreshes the sensor and verifies the door position.  But now makes me want a camera to see what's going on in my garage too now.,4,1,2018-12-28,1,2,0
"I have a detached garage so my alarm company wouldn't install a sensor in is so I needed a way to make sure my garage had some type of security. This along with a Wifi camera gives me the ability to know 100% that my garage is secure. The installation was pretty straight forward, I watched the installation video which helped a lot. The only issue I had was that with the Hub mounted on the ceiling of my garage, it would not connect to my Wifi. I have a Wifi radio in my garage that shows the Wifi signal is maxed out, So I know the signal is good, however the Hub just wouldn't connect. Could have been interference from the LED lights I have in my garage. I remembered that in one video I watched the person making the video said that the Hub could be installed on the wall, so I gave that a try. And just like that, the Hub connected to my Wifi right away.  I really like the fact that It sends me notification when my garage door is opened. I also like the fact that I can open and close the garage door with the app, I've been known to leave my home with the garage door open.  I cant speak for how it works with Alexa because I don't have any of their devices and even if I did, I wouldn't give anyone access to my garage.I do recommend this product.  So far so good.",4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"The thing is absolutely terrible.  App login takes too long - even if you don't sign out.  The app notifies me well after the door has moved (I'm talking several minutes, & I have notification set to immediate).  I previously was using NEXX & it worked flawlessly until it broke.  I would rather have nothing than have the MyQ.  I was in the garage, & had been for over an hour when I was notified that my garage door had just opened.  It hadn't moved.  Also, I understand the audible alarm - but a means to control if, & how long it sounds would be nice.  I read where people silence the alarm by opening the MyQ hub & either removing the internal speaker or filling it with glue to stop the noise.  Also, we sometimes like to have the door partially open for ventilation.  Can't do that with MyQ.  Pressing the Open/Close button while the door is in motion confuses the app, & it then becomes necessary to use either the wall switch, or the vehicle remote to cycle the door & reset the MyQ.I would NOT recommend this app to my worst enemy.  I will be selling my MyQ on ebay when I return from an upcoming trip.  I will be replacing the failed NEXX unit with another one - like I should have in the first place.",2,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0

"Pairs easily with router.  Door sensor works perfectly to tell you the door is up or down.  Here is where installation gets tricky.  Directions say to plug in your HUB at a work bench or a wall plug and pair with your garage door opener.  Mine worked fine pairing like that but would not pair if I mounted it to the ceiling first.  Then it says after testing mount to the ceiling 4 to 6 feet away and wrap the extra power cord around the mount to hide it.Mine stopped working the moment I mounted it on the ceiling and wrapped the power cord around.  Then when I thought it was a pairing problem I tried to re-pair the HUB to the opener and it would not do so.  i gave up after 15 tries.  Then I tried moving the ceiling mount.  No dice.  I took it down and was going to give up.  Then I thought about it after a week..........  the HUB is a radio transmitter.... radio transmits up and out not down and in.  If you mount the hub above it it will not operate the opener.  I brought it back down the bench, it re-paired instantly and worked every single time.",3,1,2019-9-21,1,0,0
"If you are unfortunate enough to start with a Liftmaster or Chamberlain ""MyQ"" garage door (that does not have WiFi) all you have is a totally unnecessary security protocal MyQ invented to keep you from using competitors with working. reliable free integrations that also allow opening.

So they put the MyQ logo on to trick people into getting the secure device is all.Opening is blocked for ""security"".  I don't know why they have claimed a stake in protecting MY garage.  The certainly don't have stake in protecting it with their standard garage door openers.  MyQ, your role is to provide the open function (I'm sure at a cost) and a disclaimer releasing you from all responsibility.

"After waking up several times and finding we forgot to close the garage it was time to get this gadget.  Or we drive off and my wife says ""did you close the garage?"" planting that seed of doubt so I would have to turn around and go back and YES I closed the garage!  The marriage is saved thanks to this gadget.  First, install the mobile app BEFORE you begin installing, there are videos that walk you through everything, the printed instructions aren't really meant to guide you through it all.It works with almost every garage door, they have a compatibility chart on their website if you have any doubt so check your make/model there before ordering.  There is no cutting or splicing of wires, you plug it in, that's it.  The only challenge is finding your ""pairing"" button on your garage door opener motor.  You'll need a step stool or something to reach it.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,1
"Setup failed at the start in connecting the myQ hub to the home WiFi. The myQ app got into a forever loop. The phone needed connecting directly to the hub's WiFi, and then setting up the home WiFi info from a local page. I checked the online support pages, but the info to solve the problem required chatting with a human agent. It was quick, and they were helpful.After that hiccup, setup sailed along, as the app guides you through the whole installation process. The main use case for me is setting up the schedule so that at 10PM the doors are closed. My wife has in the past not closed the garage doors overnight. Even her mom worries about that when I travel. So this way there's no problem.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
SUPER easy to install. We still use garage door openers and have alarms and all of that.  This is very convenient though to know when the garage is opened and if you forget your opener or do not want to carry it. I loaded up the how-to video on my tablet and it literally took me 10 minutes.I initially had the senor paired onthe garage door but onthe other side from where the sensor is and I had some issues so i moved it to the same side. I inititally did not want it on that side because I have other sensors but so far no intereference.,4,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"This is a much cheaper option than replacing the entire opener to get a smart option garage door opener.  We use our garage door more than the front door, and there is always the question, did we remember to close the door.  Now I have peace of mind on my phone.  The one thing I want to add to the review is how the device actually works.  It is actually a simple solution.  I thought that this wold attach to the garage door and fully integrate with the existing opener.  It doesn't.  Its a fully wireless system.  There are two parts to the system.  The first one plugs in to an outlet in the garage and then wirelessly syncs to the opener just like the keypad you have outside of the garage.  The second piece is a sensor that just attaches to the garage door with double sided velcro.  The hub can attach to two garage door openers, you just need to add a second sensor for the second door.  The sensor just indicates whether the door is up or down.  I wish I had known this when i ordered because I would have ordered two.  On black Friday they had the hub unit on sale for less than the extra sensor, if you can catch that deal take it, then you have a spare hub, but the sensors would sync to either system.  Great product.",4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"I've been holding off on this review, waiting for Chamberlain to email me back about my issues, but they haven't, so I have to give it the lowest rating possible. Basically, it works great overall. I love being able to view the status of my garage door, as well as open or close it remotely. It's also nice having another way to open my door as a backup in case my battery dies on my keypad.The biggest issue with this product is that the sensor gets stuck from time to time. It seems to happen more frequently in cold weather. Basically, you'll close the garage door, and the app will think it's still open. The only way I know for sure is to check a camera I have pointed at the door. Since it happens frequently enough, but sporadically, I can almost never trust the status that's showing in the app, particularly if it says it's open.",1,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"I got this because my old garage door openers are not working, and to replace then was gonna cost almost as much as this system.  I have 2 doors, and they are old, but are compatible with the MyQ.  I bought the basic system and then an additional sensor.  I got everything installed in about 45 min.  I am a single female and not super tech savvy.  The instructions were adequate, but the videos and corresponding slides after were frustrating cause pausing the video did not work so good.  The system worked from the beginning.  I downloaded the app before installing, and then the Amazon key app.  It has only been up and running for 1 week, but no issues yet.  I have had one in garage delivery from  Amazon, and it went without an issue.  I will need to add a friend and family member so they can use the app to open garage if needed, this is much easier than having multiple openers that may stop working. (that is what happened).  Time will tell if this system will be safe, without delivery persons taking things when dropping off packages, or after.  It is unclear to me if the device they use to get in the garage is available to drivers not working.  That is more of an Amazon key issue though.  I will update as I use the app and device more.",4,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"First things first: if you, like me, saw that this integrates with Amazon Key and therefore assumed it would work with Alexa, here’s the key point of this review: it absolutely doesn’t.  There is an integration with IFTTT you can use to have Alexa close the garage door, but not open it, and because it’s done through IFTTT, you have to use “trigger” in the voice command, which is clumsy.I had really hoped this would work like August, where it will close by voice on-demand and open by voice with a PIN code challenge.  Sadly, this is not the case.",4,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"It's yet another garage door opener that works using a  smart phone. Easy install - seems to work OK, but.... We bought this thinking Amazon would finally deliver our packages into the garage instead of just throwing them over the gate, stacking them outside the gate - and generally refusing to ring the doorbell too. Stuff gets stolen around here - as it does everywhere - and we thought, ""This solves lots of problems."" Nope. First notice we got with our next purchase was that only slower deliveries get the MyQ treatment that uses the garage door. My wife asked, ""Why? We're Prime Members and everything... Why would they NOT want to deliver them more securely?"" Why indeed? Guess we'll return it. We don't need it to open the garage - we have, including the car buttons, a dozen buttons and remotes already, plus remote access cameras with motion sensing to tell us when the door opens/closes. Waste of $45.00 and an hour and a half of our time. Makes no sense. Too bad.",1,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0

But getting it installed required a lot of trial and error and frustration. Indeed, I thought I was going to have to send it back, but I perservered.",4,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"I had no issues installing it- I followed the tips posted here in other reviews, and it worked like a champ right away.

How long  will it last, I wonder?",3,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"Ok first off this is SUPER easy to install.  My garage contains the router and modem, so wifi signal was not an issue.  I used the included velcro to attach the door sensor to the garage door (easy).  The iphone app makes setting up the myQ hub to your router very fast.  For mounting I cheated, rather than making new screws on my ceiling I just zip tied it to the mounting rails of the garage door opener.  Overall installation took about 15 minutes, very easy.Now I know everyone complains about the IFTT integration being a subscription and I agree.  Chamberlain are greedy, and you should NOT sign up for that service.  That said I wish there was ANY Alexa integration.  ANY AT ALL.  I don't need alexa to open and close my garage door, but I'd like to be able to ask alexa.... ""Alexa, Is my garage door closed?"".  Considering this is just about the only add on that works with Amazon Key I'm surprised they don't even have that level of support.",4,1,2019-6-11,1,1,0
"I got this from Amazon Warehouse and it works fine at my vacation home on an AT&T hotspot.  First thing, I did a hard reset right out of the box to clear any other user setup info.  I had to make 2 attempts to get it to connect to my hotspot router and I had to be very very patient.  I had 2 bars of wifi on my smart phone at the garage.  I have this working on a 12 year old Craftsman door opener.  Pairing/learning with the garage door opener took apps 8 attempts.  Instructions say ""TRY AGAIN"" if learning doesn't work, so I did.  My guess is many users give up and don't persist 8 times!  The system has been installed for one month with no problems. I can open and close the door from 70 miles away to let the contractors in and I can also see when the door is up if someone uses the keypad or button inside the garage.  I have not activated the Alexa capability yet, I don't see needing that, but I will try it just for fun.  Overall this is a good product.  It plays well with 4 other Wyze cameras and Wyze door sensors on the same hotspot.  I have a pretty good security system setup on a $30/month hotspot versus $70+ for a standard broadband connection from the local telco.  Keep in mind, as with any gadgets connecting to wifi and routers, expect problems.

"I have been using this device for about six months now.  I almost tossed it in the garbage after the first month.  It seems that when this device fails or has an error, the default action is to fail open.  Like I had mentioned, we were using it for a month with no issues.  We had gone out for the day and the neighbor noticed our door was open, but the car was not home.  They let us know and I attempted to close it remotely and it would not close.  I tried three times before the app told me that I needed to manually operate the door.  After we got home and used the wall switch to close the door, I attempted to open it remotely, it would not work.  Had to do a factory reset on the device to get it to work again. We have been using it since, without any further issues.  I set alerts in the app to notify me as soon as the door is open now as a precaution.  I can understand why the app developers set this device to fail open, as they do not want you to be locked out of your garage, but it is a bit of a security risk when that does occur.",3,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"I've wanted to add some type of smart home integration to my garage door openers for a while and finally pulled the trigger once the MYQ-G0301 dropped below $60.  Two months later, I bought an adapter for the second garage door (another $30) and now have both garage doors controlled via app.There are some things I love about this.  First, Amazon now delivers packages to my garage.  We've never had a package stolen off of our doorstep, but somehow the Amazon delivery drivers give at least one of our packages to a neighbor at least once per month (we usually receive 5-10 packages from Amazon monthly).  Because they now use Amazon Key to deliver our packages, they see the picture of our garage door and have to open *our* garage door, which prevents them from leaving it with a neighbor.  I don't think we've had a misdelivered package since installing and that would probably be worth it alone.",4,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"Snap to set up.  Didn't even bother with the mount.  I applied a heavy duty adhesive to both devices.  The powered sensor and the one instructed to apply to the garage door.

However, I'm dinging a star for these parts of the installation experience:- The instructions in the paper vs. in the app don't match, I hate it when companies do that. Are there different teams working on these? E.g., paper instructions said to pull sensor tab first, then install the app. The app does a walkthrough then tells you to pull the same activation tab you already did earlier",4,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"If you can follow simple instructions, you can install this with your compatible garage door opener in half an hour.

That can't be said for their website unfortunately.The product works as advertised. What the description doesn't say online is the very loud beeping it will make when you ask it to close (and not very quick to do so). It is a safety measure, but I'd really like the option to turn the beeping off. The integrations with other services wasn't straight forward. I had to find a website to ""purchase"" these integrations such as Google Assistant or IFTT. Even though they were free ""for a limited time"" that doesn't give you any confidence they will remain free. Keep in mind these integrations are only for checking on door status or closing the door, never opening it.

I finally try to open the door with my Nest Home Hub and myQ through my smart speaker says ""For security reasons I cannot open the Garage door"".

"It wouldn't pair with my door motor, but a call to there support team had it working in no time.  They were very good at supporting the process to get the hub working with your lift motor.  High praise from me.  Its been an extremely long time since I was impressed by a support person.  I assumed i would have to send it back after i couldn't get the door to pair with the control hub for close to an hour.PS.  The most important part is to mount the door sensor on the door prior to setting it up.  I didn't want to mount it in case I needed to send it back.  Tech had me tape it to the door temporarily and that was the issue.  The hub needed to sense the door opening after it gave the command.  Since it was just sitting upright on the workbench it failed.  One other thing, my learn button looked grey or white to me.  The choices of button colors to push during pairing are Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple and Red, no grey or white.  I must be color blind as the tech looked the website and saw the frequency of the door motor and said I had to choose purple button on the list.  I had already tried all the colors, and in hindsight only the purple choice had the door move.  That should have been a clue prior to calling them.

"After using this for several months I'd say this is better than nothing but has issues.  I have 2 of these and have installed them on 2 separate doors.  One door is rarely used and this unit seems to work perfectly.  My main garage that gets used everyday, fails to detect that the garage is closed about 30% of the time.  So I'll leave in the morning, using the normal openers (not MyQ), and about 30min later I'll get a notification on my phone that the garage is still open.  I've since put a camera in the garage to double check and so far this notification has been wrong 100% of the time.  So MyQ thinks the garage is still open, so I use the MyQ app to close the door which then causes the door to actually open.  MyQ then detects this as a fault and shuts off remote access, so at that point I'm away from home and have no way to close the door.  If I ignore the 'door still open' alert then many hours later it'll properly detect the door as closed.About a month ago I used the support form on the MyQ site and still haven't heard back.

"I bought Chamberlain garage door opener with MyQ, thinking it works remotely using WIFI, but after installation found out that my particular model, although has MyQ logo, needs an extra gear (MyQ Hub) to work with home network. Models must have both ""MyQ"" and ""WIFI"" logos to eliminate the need for MyQ hub. Anyways since the opener already was installed in my garage, I ordered MyQ Hub. Installation instruction does not exist and if you try to follow the App to set up, you will most likely get to a dead end. I had to call the customer service, and promptly got help to finally install the hub and get it to work. There were several steps going back and forth from the app and the web site. So I hope Chamberlain fix this unfriendly install process. After installation it works fine. when closes using the app, opener makes a loud beeping sound that is very annoying, it might wake neighbors up if i use it late nights or early mornings to close the garage door.one last positive point was that customer service was very friendly and helped promptly to setup the hub with home network, otherwise i would give it 0 starts.",4,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0

"I was really looking forward to this device. I use Google Home products throughout my house and I have been searching for a automated garage door opener that would integrate with these devices. Unfortunately, at this point in time, MyQ is NOT that device. I realized shortly after receiving the MyQ that it only integrates with Google ASSISTANT and not Google Home. This is definitely frustrating. Even after installing Google Assistant and signing up for the subscription (which I also didn't realize was necessary, but is apparently ""free for a limited time""), through the MyQ app, I can only CLOSE my garage door with voice commands. This makes ZERO sense. When asking Google to OPEN the garage door, it tells me that it's unable to do so ""due to security reasons."" After doing a bit of Googling, this seems to be a pretty standard problem and it is with MyQ and not Google Assistant. Basically, this significantly limits the usefulness of this device and makes me regret purchasing it before Chamberlain figured out their own product.That said, installation is pretty straightforward and after fussing with my garage door opener (not a Chamberlain product, but listed as compatible on their site), I was able to get it to work properly. I can both open and close the door from the MyQ app.",3,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I have two garage door openers - one is a newer Chamberlain model that is MyQ enabled and one is an older Chamberlain.  The internet-connectivity has come in handy, for example, was able to have a friend stop in and pick something up for us while we were at the beach several hours away and they were joining us there later.  Also nice for kids to be able to open without keeping a separate opener in their cars or if they're getting dropped off by a friend.Was excited to find this Hub deal during Prime days and it works great now that everything is connected.  Most of the install was easy to follow through their app, including wifi setup, but I ran into a problem pairing to the opener.  Here's where I deducted one star.  Tried multiple times to get hub connected to opener with no luck (spent maybe 30-45 min trying), ultimately got frustrated and tried to call their support and was on hold 25 min before I hung up, their chat support feature didn't work, so I defaulted to email.  Well intended email response a couple days later asked for info I already provided, like opener model.  Couldn't find any hints online for this specific issue but thanks to another reviewer Steve, I tried something different that worked.  He mentioned, and I'm paraphrasing, that some older openers can only remember a limited number of connected devices.  How I solved my issue was erasing all prior codes (hold down the learn button for ~10 sec), basically starting from scratch.  I also cleared out all the old device attempts in MyQ app, not realizing I had created duplicates.  After starting over, pairing the hub worked perfectly and I had things up and running in less than 5 min.  Had to reconnect car homelink buttons, portable openers, and keypads but they all work now.",4,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"Got this on a deal primarily for the ability to alert and close my door remotely at night. The app works well and can be scheduled to either automatically close the door at a certain time, or to send an email/push notification if the door is open/closed/stopped at any time. The app is free and no additional services are required to do this scheduling.Setup was a breeze. I followed the instructions, which really just meant powering things on and mounting them. The on door sensor must have an acceleromter in it to know if it's facing up (when door is closed) or horizontal (when open) and it was easy to stick on with the included two sided tape. The hub plugged in and took about 30 seconds in total to get it on my wifi, I have both 2.4ghz and 5ghz, and it only works on the 2.4 so be aware. This is fairly typical of IoT things though, so if you have other devices no big surprise. Mounting the hub is also pretty simple, just two screws and it's done. The directions have recommended spacing of where to put things, I loosely followed them and have no problems.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"Editing to add one star because there is an Alexa workaround available, although I’m not sure MyQ should get the credit.  The MyQ app works with the Simple Commands app and Simple Commands works with Alexa.  So now my phone tells Alexa when I’m arriving home, Alexa tells Simple commands, Simple Commands tells the MyQ App, MyQ tells this hub and this hub tells my Lift Master opener so that my garage is fully open by the time I reach it with my car.  Essentially I got what I wanted but it’s more complicated than I expected.I think the listing is misleading, this works with Amazon Key so I assumed it worked with Alexa.  It doesn’t.",3,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
Bought a Smart Opener to monitor my garage door while away as there has been questionable openings of the garage door.  I had a nosy neighbor who monitored my every move... he used to call me if my garage door remained open!  The nosy neighbor recently moved so I lost my surveillance and needed an alternative watch system.Selected MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain MYQ-G0301  based on reviews and known compatibility with my Chamberlain opener... and the price is unbeatable at 25 bucks.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"The connection and linking from the Hub to the door sensor and the mobile app was very fast and the instructions from the app were intuity and easy to follow, in fact I recommend using the app over the enclosed papers because it has prettier pictures and videos!Linking it to the garage door of the same brand was tricky and it took me multiple attempts because my wifi signal would drop after the whole configuration was successful. This would cause the sensor to go on monitor only. After some moving around I found a good spot about 3 feet away from the garage door opener where the wifi signal was greater than 65%. Once the wifi signal was obtained setup and linking to the door opener only took seconds and a single try.",5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"I was able to get this device hooked up so I could use my phone as a garage door opener.  It does work, in my case it took some fiddling around.  The initial set up was to download the app and install it near the garage door opener.  Fortunately for me, there was an open outlet in the ceiling right next to the garage door opener.  The first attempt was frustrated by a weak wifi signal, so I installed an extender and it works pretty well, but it certainly doesn't replace a simple garage door remote.  Imagine the difference of pushing a nearby single button on your remote/car or whatever other device you use to open your garage door and finding the app on your phone, letting it open the interface then pressing the soft button in the center of the screen.  Sometimes it will open right up and work, other times it will go to a different screen so you can update and/or save the configuration.  The good thing about this is that you can open your garage door from a greater distance than a typical garage door remote.  Is it worth installing on your phone? YMMV",3,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"I hesitated getting this with all the 'have to subscribe' to add Google Home support comments. I read I could get a 2-month trial of it - but I never bothered with Google.

"After reading another review with lengthy tips regarding installation I was a bit worried, but I decided to give it a try anyway. As it turned out, installation took seven minutes from the time I opened the box, and the unit has worked flawlessly since then. My garage is fairly close to my router, so signal strength wasn't an issue. Also, I realized that the hub doesn't need to be mounted up on the ceiling next to the opener. The installation pictures show it up there, but maybe that's because that's where the power outlet is in many garages. Anyway, I just plugged the hub into a wall outlet in the garage and it works fine -- no issues communicating with the opener, which is about 12' away. As a result I didn't have to mess with a ladder, and didn't even have to mess with the mounting bracket, since the hub just sits on a shelf near the outlet. Couldn't have been simpler. The unit synchronized with my opener with a single button push. Since installation a couple of weeks ago the system has performed reliably. It allowed me to open the garage for the AC repair guy when I wasn't home, and reliably alerts me every time the door goes up or down (the settings are customizable). Overall, a great convenience. UPDATE, ONE BIG NEGATIVE: After being installed only a few months, I received an alert that the battery in the door sensor is almost dead. The sensor uses a button battery, which is kind of crazy. Why don't they put in real batteries that will last a while? This is especially a problem if you have a seasonal home and plan to use the MyQ to open and close the door for contractors when you're gone. The battery won't last long enough. Big flaw in an otherwise excellent home automation system.One last note: Never buy this system at full price. It goes on sale periodically with deep cuts in price, so wait if you can.",3,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"Bought this because I wanted to be able to open my garage door if someone came by and I was away.  I didn't care about the Amazon Key, but since the price was right, I got the garage door bundled with the camera.I read many reviews on different products and because of the price went with this model, knowing there were some limitations to use 3rd party apps, at least without a charge.

I just set it on a shelf in the garage, but it works great every time.The only thing I didn't figure out before buying it is that you can't tell Google Home or Alexa to open the garage door.  You can tell it to ask MyQ to close the door, but not to open it.  I understand that based on security reasons, but there should be some sort of override for that if you're willing to accept it.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Very easy to install. Took about 10 minutes. I had no issues with connecting to WiFi. But everyone was right about connecting to Google Home/Assistant.  HORRiBLE!! They need to do a better job with connecting to Google Home. Luckily it's not a must for me. It would have been nice to have voice control and that would make it a 5 star. But only gave 4. Works great with my garage. Definitely recommend it. Gives alerts when door is open/close and history. I like that. But if connecting to a Voice control App like Google Home is what you want. Don't get it. Otherwise it's a good product. Although I did not have to pay the subscription fee. They were running a free offer. When you use Google Home it goes to MyQ app then you have to the door. They need to work on the integration with Google Home. Didn't use Amazon Alexa, so can't say how it works.

"I give MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain MYQ-G0301 a five-star rating for these reasons; 1. Simple setup - no need to disconnect/connect any wiring to the garage door controller. 2. Works instantly and from anywhere if your cell phone is connected. 3. It seems more reliable than Z-wave Garage Door Opener – I owe a GoControl/Linear GD00Z-4 Z-Wave Garage Door Opener Remote Controller and many times it fails to open/close the door. 4.

An hour on the phone with Chamberlain - no luck.  He mentioned ""oh, you bought it on Amazon?  No wonder you have problems.""  - not buying it, they all come from the same factory.  Decided it must be the (brand new) batteries in the sensor.Unplug the hub, move it to another location - no luck.  Put the hub on the floor - ding!  it worked.

"I couldn't figure out the Genie Aladin setup even though it was compatible it just looked like too much work to install so I instead went with this route and the setup took less than 10 minutes.  I didn't feel comfortable mounting it to the roof of my garage so instead I used Command Strips to stick it to the wall in the garage near the AC.  I didn't have to align any wires on the ground or mess with my garage unit.  it was simple and straight forward setup.  Make sure to watch the setup video it's super cheesy but it highlights all the important pre-work you have to do before setting it up.

My garage door opener is a Chamberlain, so the MyQ is automatically compatible. However, if you have a different brand, there is a pretty huge list of compatible openers on the MyQ website.Anyway, installation took me about 10 minutes, including dragging out my ladder to reach the ceiling of the garage where I installed the hub, and cleaning the dust off the spot on the garage door where I mounted the sensor. It all worked right away, since the garage is directly below the room where my WiFi router lives.

I did also actually have a defective unit (according to support) the first time around and returned for a second one. However I now think the support person just couldn’t figure out my opener was not compatible. I intend to replace one of my openers with an actual LiftMaster (ugh also made by Chamberlain). I found it incredibly annoying that my opener was not listed as incompatible. I really wanted this for Amazon deliveries.

"I purchased this system to accommodate a second opener on a second garage door. I just had an Overhead Door brand Odyssey 1000 (model # 7030) installed. This door opener was built in 2020 according to the serial number (which started with a “20”). When I called to discuss my challenges with Chamberlain they informed me the newer door openers aren’t compatible. They said Overhead Door has created their own product that competes with Chamberlain and the new openers were no longer compatible. So this product was easy to set up and operates my 2002 Overhead Door “Phantom” opener just fine, but it won’t touch the new Odyssey. I even tried another owner’s workaround that was posted here and it seemed to pair the opener, but it would not operate the unit. So bottom line, it only works with my 18 year old opener!

"While the device picks up our WIFI better than most devices, our garage is so far out I had to add  some parts. It was a bit unstable due to the WIFI signal being a little weak. I added an Ether Net over power set and then put a wireless access point in the garage. Now that it is getting good signal it works as fast as my regular clicker and is more stable than my ancient wall button. Also since I used to forget whether or not I close the garage and would have to double back to check, I have peace of mind and have not had to double back once since I installed it. Now if I could just get the Amazon delivery drivers to follow instructions and put my packages in the garage I would be very happy. But that is not the fault of Chamberlain.I would like to see all of the instructions before starting. If those could be added to a web page and the URL put on a card in the package that would be great. They are in the App but I like to see what is next and it keeps me from making mistakes when I see ahead just a little.

"It works perfectly, no complain about how easy it is to install. One tip though is to set up the hub and pair the garage door sensor before trying to put the sensor up on the top panel of the garage door. The instruction tells you to just put the sensor up first, but doing so making it more difficult to get paired with the hub. So when I'm done setting up everything, the last step says to put up a safety sticker, that's when I realize this thing will by-pass the safety sensor at the door which detects a subject intruding the path when closing and triggers a reversion to stop or open the door (instead of closing it). Well, that's a big concern to me because I have kids around the house, and so safety is always my concern. So now I trade off the worries about whether I close the garage door or not with the worries of somebody might get hurt when i press the close button on the phone. Such a nightmare! So for this reason I would never dare to use the scheduled closing. Also the app does not automatically send you any alert, you need to go in and set up alert such as garage door was closed/opened and etc. Anyways, i figure the current remote system is not a pain, so i still mostly use the physical remote and myQ will come in handy when I am not physically around or when i need to open the door for somebody else w/o moving my a**. But then again i just feel like it does not make much sense for myQ to completely ignore the safety sensor detection.",3,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0

I didn't watch the video I just followed the installation instructions that came up (first thing) when I first opened the app. The instructions were easy to follow and everything installed quickly and easily... for my install. My fathers install took longer because the app didn't show it finished connecting to the unit. After waiting 20 minutes I unplugged the unit and started over. It then connected pretty quickly. I think it had connected because the unit led wasn't blinking but... well.  Anyway, I enjoy being able to see when my garage door opens/closed (letting my know when my son gets home) and being able to close it if/when he forgets to. One irritation was the alarm that goes off when closing. After my father closed his door the alarm continued for at least 15 seconds or more. I do wish the alarm stopped when the garage door opener stopped. That's my only complaint.",4,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Update: Yeah, I tried to switch my router, and my smart hub failed.  It keeps saying ""this serial number does not match the hub"" and ""cannot connect to server""... even though it was on my other router 2 hours before!  Now my device is not even recognized.  Chamberlain Support was not even helpful.  If you never need to touch this ever, it's good.  If there are any changes, good f'ing luck.I bought this MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener because the range for one of my garage doors dropped so much that I couldn't even open the garage door from the outside with multiple remotes and I also tried changing batteries.  This solves that problem because it uses my wifi network to tell the MyQ opener to open the garage door from the inside and it's closer to the antennae.  I don't need to try and resolder the garage door opener antennae, lengthen the antennae, drill a small hole into the garage door so I can get an antennae through, buy a new garage door opener when mine is mechanically sound, etc.",1,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"This company seems to be the WORST! First of all, it's NOT compatible with Wink as advertised (The entire reason I bought it) secondly the ""Support"" team does anything BUT support the customers, it's been nothing but runaround and BS from the reps. I'll be looking for a refund and possibly a class action lawsuit.Oh yeah, you can't open your door using IFTTT or Google home, only Apple Home Kit.

I don't know why people are bitching about subscription fees, I installed mine with an additional garage door remote and HAVE NOT SIGNED UP FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS.

"I had asked my local garage door company if they could add the MyQ feature to my existing opener. They said that I would need to install a new opener for $500. I took a chance and bought this product instead and I am glad I did. There was an addendum to the instructions for an IOS device that required me to connect to a WiFi signal from the device and open a web page in Safari to connect to my network. That went well and the only glitch was pairing with my opener. While the button on the back appeared to be red, it was actually purple. That took several attempts and had the effect of disabling my other garage door opening remotes. It was easy to reconnect them. I used to forget if I had closed my garage door but I don’t have to worry about that anymore as the MyQ app on my phone tells me if the door is open or closed. This is a great product and saved me $400.",5,1,2017-12-18,1,3,0

"I would suggest that you exactly follow the instructions step by step to make sure you have a successful first time installation and set up. I have an MyQ Chamberlain garage door opener so was disappointed that could not use it as is to remotely control my garage door. The options were to purchase either the Home Link or the Garage Hub. The Home Link would connect directly to the MyQ garage door opener and make it a smart device and is compatible with Apple devices, however, I would still need an additional add on device to add my second garage door to the group, besides that the Home Link is being offered at a higher price than the Garage Hub which is compatible not only with the MyQ but with most other garage door opener brands and models. The MyQ app is free to download and use and currently the Google Home app and the IFTT migrations are available at no cost but no option for Alexa connectivity, however, the Amazon Key and Amazon Garage is also available among some other options for no additional at this time. I am connected to IFTT and Google through my MyQ App and that is great to use, however, I won't be willing to pay any monthly fee if Chamberlain later decides to start charging for these options that are free with other brands and providers. Until then, I would recommend this device!",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0

"I'm writing this review in hopes that Chamberlain will read it and make the relatively simple software changes that would turn it from a 3-star to a 5-star product. Anyone buying this device would want it to integrate with their other ""smart"" devices and home security systems and this is where it falls short. There is no integration with Alexa, Siri, or Apple's Homekit. There is an app for your iPhone but you can't say ""open door"" and must use your hands like an old style clicker. If you don't have Face ID enabled, you must enter a username & password before pressing the ""open"" button. Time consuming & tedious. Likewise, you can't ask Alexa if the garage door is open or tell it to open for someone while your hands are busy. I would also like to see an app for my Fitbit so I could use that to open the door. Another feature that is strangely lacking is rule based commands. For instance, I would like to have a rule that states ""close the garage door if it has been open for 30 minutes"". There is an alert for this situation, but you have to see the alert and close the door manually. Conversely, there is a scheduling feature that doesn't seem useful. Who opens and closes their garage door on a regular schedule? On the plus side, it did install and connect to my network pretty easily and does a good job of alerting me when the door is opened or closed. I have used the Amazon Key delivery service with it and that works well. It's just odd that Amazon endorsed this product that doesn't work with Alexa when there are others that do. I believe all of these issues can be corrected fairly easily with software so I hope Chamberlain will do that work and send out the updates that will make this a 5-star product. If that happens, I will happily update my review.",3,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0

"Overall, my experience with the Chamberlain product has been very good, but with a couple of exceptions. The WiFi-enabled portion of the system works very well, after a few installations (software, not hardware) issues. The real problem has been in trying to link the system into HomeKit. After a couple of days messing around with it, I finally gave up on getting the HomeKit hub to work, and now it's sitting where it's mounted on the garage wall unplugged and acting as a wall decoration. Trying to get the HomeKit integration to work was probably the most maddening thing I have done in several years. Not only did it not work, but it hard-crashed my Apple HomePod so bad that I had to unplug it and not only reboot it, but go through a entire re-install of the system. After going through it a couple of times, I had had enough, and now there it sits.I _do_ like the WiFi enabled part of the system. It works flawlessly, and I use my iPhone and Apple Watch to open and close the door. It just doesn't have the HomeKit integration that I originally thought I needed, but now see that it may not be that important.",4,1,2018-4-24,1,2,0
"This could not have been simpler to install and get working for a single user.As for setting up multiple users, that’s pretty easy, but they sure missed the boat on security best practices. You can grant open/close access to “family”, “friends”, or “other”.  Sounds good, but I can’t tell the difference between which privileges each group gets. I wanted a family member to get notifications when the garage door opens or closes, but that’s not supported. Only the original account holder can get those alerts. Or, share your login credentials with somebody, then they will also get the notifications. So much for the accountability part of security. Sharing credentials? Bzzt.  Thanks for playing, we have some lovely parting gifts for you. Tech support is prompt and helpful, and they say they’ve passed my security suggestions to the development team. I hope there’s an app update to improve the security features soon.",3,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
Installation was super easy and the video instructions are great. It'd be hard to screw that up if you watch the videos.The worst thing about this system - and something that is incredibly frustrating - is that it is not compatible with Google Assistant without a paid subscription.

They have average length 1 - 1.5 car garages, but I have a longer 4-car garage with two doors and it's not working well for me. One hub can control two sensors, so I bought a second sensor. The hub, sensors, and openers need to be fairly close to one another (like under 10') for them to work correctly. I've yet to get them working consistently well. Support is mainly via India chat (aka. a joke). Phone support wait times are infinite. If you have a larger garage, think twice before ordering.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,1,0

I still had to sign up for it through the App but it was free and it worked So I went ahead and installed it. The install took about 30 minutes. I did not mount mine to the ceiling but simply put it on a shelf in the Garage and connected it to my WiFi. Everything is working Well so far.

"I had to go to the website and review the manual and even then had some challenges getting the Hub to pair with the garage door opener. The open is a fairly new Craftsman (Chamberlin) with the purple ""Learn"" button. I had no trouble pairing the door sensor with the Hub and no problem getting the Hub on my network. But using the phone app to get the Hub to pair with the opener was time consuming and a pain.  The phone app also would appear stuck in the pairing mode for several minutes and wouldn't come out of that gracefully. I expected a timeout or some indication that it wasn't successful and allow me to retry. I finally gave up trying to pair with the Hub to the opener after several attempts and had to get the Craftsman manual out. I found that the Craftsman wired wall mount opener also had a ""Learn"" feature on it. I was able to use that part of the garage door opening system to pair with the Hub (first try). I have no idea why pressing the garage door opener Learn button would not allow the Hub to pair.The other issue I had was trying to set schedules. I wanted the door to open automatically at 6 a.m. but for security reasons, opening via the schedule isn't allowed. I tried multiple times to have is close via the schedule at 10 p.m. in case I forgot, but the phone app repeatedly stated there was a problem with the door opening and it had to be reset by using the actual garage door opener to cycle the door. Multiple times I would reset the door and reschedule but I got the same error. I've had no problems using the app to open or close the door by tapping the app Open/Close button.  Not sure why the scheduler isn't just issuing the same command in the code as touching the Open/Close button on the screen.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I am delighted very well by this product so far with 3 days using experience.  The installation process is quite easy and they have a clear instruction to guide you step by step, as other smart home devices do.  The pairing process to my old lift master door opener is amazing that I didn't think it would be so easy and it does. After set up, the device is ready to go.  However, at the beginning I was a little bit surprised as it doesn't fully support Alexa. And the MyQ skill in Alexa was not there anymore therefor I tried IFTTT first, but the company only allow you to close the door with voice but not open due to security concern.  Totally understood but still not happy until I found simplecommands which allows me to create use sense and linked to Alexa for voice control, open/close with my secret words.  It works well now and I am quite enjoying to ask Alexa to do this new home feature everyday.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
"I wanted to physically harm the people who designed this product when I first tried to set it up. After weeks of not being able to set up the sensor, I decided to look up the model of my garage door opener and was devastated to learn that the color of the learn button was actually purple but apparently faded overtime and looked orange. All of those attempts were in vain because the button was a different color. I also realized that other peoples warnings of LED lights were not simply hogwash but actually true. When I turned off all of the LED lights I was at least able to get it to pair in “monitor” mode when I was still selecting the incorrect learn color. I would like to suggest that the makers of this item allow it to be programmed without the user being required to select the color of the learn button. I’m sure there’s a way to design the programming to allow that — to me, it is laziness. Other than that, the annoyingly loud beeping is the only nuisance that I experience when using the app. Its probably designed to prevent lawsuits.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

Instructions make you think that when you press the button on the door sensor that the red light should come on. Red LED only flashes once when you press the button.The first garage door I tried to connect to the system failed at least three times. The odd part was that the door would go up and down and function perfectly except the App on my phone kept telling me that it had failed. Turned out that the Door Sensor I had previously connected had become disconnected. So while everything worked correctly the App reported a fail due to not knowing that the door had come open and shut. Deleted everything and started over.

Alexa doesn’t pair with it as far as I know but it does work with Amazon Key. I have not had any issues with it opening by itself, yet. But will update this if I experience anything like that.UPDATE. After having this for a few months, I will say that I have run into technical difficulties but have come up with solutions. Originally I had the setting to shut garage door at a certain time of night if open. This actually proved to be counter productive because as the battery in the garage door sensor starts losing juice it will actually fail to recognize it’s already closed and end up opening the garage and then glitching out and leaving the garage door open at night unless you close the garage door with original hardware. I’ve since learned to not enable that setting and also be conscious of battery health of the door sensor. Seldom run into issues after that though.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0

"Affordable, work as intended with my 20 year old opener. The instructions give you the impression its plug & play, but it isn't. You have to press unmarked buttons on the device to locate wifi, sync it to your phone app, 'Learn' your garage remote signal in a particular order, none of which are listed in the instructions. Its basically just a parts list. I had the wherewithall to go searching via Google and found a Youtube video from the manufacturer. Why its not listed in the instructions is baffling... but that's the key to a successful install. Took all of 5 minutes once I learned the sequence things needed to be programmed. there is no camera with the kit, though I think you can purchase one...so it will tell you when it opens and closes via the app, and allow you to close & open remotely, but it won't let you 'see' the nature of the door [my daughter notoriously leaves it up], but if you aren't physically going back into the app to check the status, once its alerted you, it doesn't tell you its still up...but knowing I can put it down from anywhere is still a convenience I didn't have before the install.

I called two times today and both times I spoke to incompetent people guessing at answers without listening and stating them with conviction.  The first tech cut me of and told me I had to call Apple, it wasn't their problem and Apple must be blocking notification.  I am pretty savvy so I knew this was BS.  Asked how he explained no email notifications.  This stumped him and he back tracked, put me on hold for 45 minutes with no check in and then hung up on me!  I called back and got a woman who told me you only get notification of you open or close the door from the keypad outside the door!  You can't make this stuff up.

Follow the instructions and test everything out before you mount it up.  Something I did notice about the app is it only tells you what it has done as far as if the door is opened or closed.  IE, if you opened with the app and closed with a vehicle remote, it will still say it is open.  It is not intuitive enough to know if it's opened or closed on its own, only what it has done.

"Despite what you may have seen on Apple's website, this product *does not work with HomeKit*.

There's no technical reason that this product couldn't be HomeKit-enabled out of the box - but Chamberlain would very much like to sell you a separate hub for another $90 to enable that feature. I'm returning mine, and getting something else. Their smartphone app is fine, but also doesn't indicate HomeKit compatibility - despite having a screen in the app where HomeKit homes are actually pictured as available, you can't enable the opener the way you'd expect.

I set this up as remote sensor as I have a garage for a third vehicle. I like the fact that I only needed 1 MyQ hub to operate 2 sensors. It works most of the time but sometimes I get a connection error where it can't sense whether the garage is closed or open. This may happen more frequently if you use the car remote or the wall remote to open the door instead of the MyQ phone app.However best practice is to ensure that the sensor is within 15 feet of the hub. This second garage is perpendicular to the other garage where the hub is located so I'm pushing the limits of the range. If my set up was a tandem 3 car garage I'm sure it would work 100% of the time. So I'm only docking it 2 stars because of the range.,3,1,2020-6-28,1,0,1
"Update: After only 1 year, a ton of annoying issues have popped up. The coin cell battery on the door sensor had already ran out only 6 months, that's fine given that this is a smart device, but when I replaced the battery, it still kept showing as a ""low battery"" warning when I pulled the app up. Tested and tried other batteries, still doesn't go away.Next issue is that the door opener hub/app will randomly decides that it won't work. I believe this is on chamberlains end because when this does happen, my internet connection still works fine (can still browse the web and such, both from the home router and mobile data). When this does happen, you are SOL until it decides to work again (it was winter when I bought this device, it is also winter as of this update, and its freezing, any downtime is straight up unacceptable!)",2,1,2018-2-17,1,1,0

"You screw or stick a little battery-powered sensor box to your door that senses whether door is open or closed by whether it is vertical or horizontal.  That door sensor connects to the other, slightly larger, box called the hub, by means of a wi-fi signal.  The hub connects to the internet by your home wi-fi.  The hub you screw to the ceiling near the door opener motor and it plugs into AC power.  The hub connects to the door opener just like the little transmitter you keep in your car by radio signal -- no wired connection.  You put the opener in learning mode just like you do when you get a new transmitter for your car.  Before you do that, however, you have to download the app to your phone and register yourself on the app.  Then the app finds the hub on the internet and takes you through the steps for pairing the hub to the opener.  Tip:  When you register it tries to put you right into a screen to do this.  It's better to get out of that screen and re-open the app to do this, using the ""add device"" routine.  Telephone tech support is good and I had no trouble getting through on a Saturday.  There is no monthly or annual fee for connecting to your opener through the app.  Once it is all set up, you can get emails whenever the door is left open for more than X minutes (you select X).  You can also set a schedule that will close the door if it is open on a regular timetable.  I set mine to close at 9 am, 9 pm and noon, just in case someone leaves it open and I don't see the email alert right away.  You can also check at any time to see whether the door is open or closed and you can open or close it.  An alarm goes off in the garage before it closes, as a safety measure.  And of course, your door should have its own safety system that would keep it from closing on someone (nearly all do, if not all).",5,1,2019-3-9,1,0,0

I have had a lot of trouble with this device. First off I had to give the device a static IP address or I got constant lag issues but that doesn't fix the Bluetooth connection from the door open/close sensor. I even had chamberlain send me another door sensor thinking that was the issue but it turns out that it's just bad design. I should have thought about the known interference issues that Bluetooth devices have. I even contacted chamberlain customer support a second time and received no help. I'm pretty sure the issue is that Bluetooth uses 2.4GHz frequency and so does wifi so they interfere with each other and changing the router channel didn't help me. I don't have any fluorescent lighting or other Bluetooth/wifi devices in the area.I would send this back but we already threw out the box. I should also mention that I'm an electrical engineer and still had all these issues.,1,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I purchased this with trepidation fearing it would need wiring into the garage opener, and that I would need to follow wiring diagrams. In fact, it arrived with no instructions at all in the box!However, there was no problem. You just download the app on your phone, enter the serial number of the device, and the app walks you through everything step by step.

"Does NOT work.  Second unit I tried set up properly and I even popped to subscribe so I could use Google Home.  Right after I subscribed it was downhill from there.  You have to ask Google to ask MyQ if the door is open, then open or close it.  Sorry MyQ says, due to security it won’t actually open or shut the door.  Yes I set up Voice Recognition in Google Home for security.  So I’ll check the app for door status.  Server error.  Fine.  Wait a day.  Server error.  Deleted app and reinstalled.  Server error.  Attempted password reset.  After temp password received I tried to change password.  Another server error.  Fine,  I’ll just keep pasting in the temp password.  Server error.  Emailed support.  Answer:  your account is fine try again.  Days later same status.  Email support complete with screen prints of all error messages.  We’ll reply in a business day.  Four days later no reply.

No matter how many times I re-connect/re-establish the unit to WIFI it fails to close the garage. NO it is not the optic door sensors (common problem) because they work fine. The door closes using the OEM opener or wall button, or outside mounted remote. It fails just like the one I purchased in July 2019. Chamberlin will not even respond to my email inquiries.

"Buyer beware. This product is defective. I bought it a month back and installed it with two sensors for a 2-door garage. Both openers are Liftmaster with Orange button. Initially, worked like a charm. Added Amazon Key capability and had a few deliveries inside the garage.Today, the Amazon Key delivery did not work. The app would not open or close the door used for Amazon delivery. Driver did standard delivery. Per customer service/FAQs, I deleted the second sensor and reprogrammed it. Now it was opening and closing both doors at the same time. Went thru reset-delete-app-re-install cycle 5 times. Same problem. Finally, I deleted one sensor thinking let me just use one door for now.",1,1,2019-6-13,1,2,0
"This product is well worth the price! Easy to install, works fantastic! Gives peace of mind to check the status of your garage door from anywhere in the internet world.  It is so simple and works so well that it really is a no-brainer! I like being able to open the door for a service person - I have a keypad and in the past I've had to give the code out, but this is a more secure way, plus you know exactly when they arrived and if they closed the door!  I plan to set it up to automatically close my garage at 10:00p.m. nightly, there is no worse feeling to going into your garage in the morning and realizing you left your garage door open all night.I totally recommend this and I absolutely love it! It took me under 30 minutes to install. My only issue with install and totally my fault is when I pressed the ""learn"" button on the door opener, I pressed too long and it erased all my other remotes which I had to reprogram.I would like to see Alexa integration, but that wasn't a deal-breaker for me, just a nice to have feature.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"It was very easy to install AFTER I watched the YouTube presentation.  I would have gotten the same information IF I had completed the registration on my smart phone.  It would have been helpful IF they had said, ""For complete instructions on how to install your MyQ, installing the app will lead you through the full installation process"" or ""Look at the YouTube video at .....""  Once I saw the video, it was a breeze to install and it works GREAT!  I like how I can open and close the door from my cell phone.  If I have someone stopping by when I'm not home, I can open the door for them!  If I have a delivery AND I can get them to call me, I can open and close the door for the delivery.  My only complaint after the install is that the notification that my garage door has opened or is closed might be delayed 10 minutes or more!  If I'm away from home and my garage door opens, I want to know it immediately!  Not maybe 10 or more minutes later, not when I happen to turn on my phone.  If I'm going to call the police, I need to be able to notify them while the person(s) are in there, not minutes after they have come and gone!  So, what is the delay?  Cloud issues?  Not enough head room on your computers/storage/program?  And YES, I would recommend the product.  I bet there is another updated version coming out!",4,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"What an infuriating system! I spent hours yesterday trying to get my Chamberlain Liftmaster Formula I to pair. I gave up after trying so many things and submitted for a replacement due to defective product. The replacement came today (next day, thanks Amazon!) and the same problems, but of course. But today I had an idea to not use Liftmaster but instead use OTHER and that worked! I pressed the orange button and as soon as it went out pressed it again. OTHER finally hit 3 of 11 (takes time) and that hit the magic code and it worked. Did this for both units. Trying to change Wi-Fi to another router is also infuriating as I reset the unit but it immediately pairs to the wifi you used before. Some people have multiple routers in their homes (I have 3) so you can't just reconnect to the same thing automatically. Whatever, it's done, it's working, I like having this feature on my phone to know if I left a door open and the other benefits. Setup is a bear, hopefully this tip of using OTHER will help you.",3,1,2018-12-30,1,1,0
"It does allow me to open the doors with the MyQ app. However, it doesn't work with Alexa and even though it claims to work with Google Assistant that doesn't work in a functional way (it will give status of the door sometimes but it won't accept any commands to control the doors. IFFFT worked though it was way too difficult to setup. And, they (Chamberlain) are saying they are going to start charging for the right to use this integration (which most every other maker is able to make work) which does not work for this product. Disappointed in the amount of money I paid expecting something more advanced but ended up with nothing more than a glorified app that barely works and only opens the doors in limited ways. Although it does work kind of ok with Amazon Key but sometimes the door doesn't open for the drivers which means they either have to leave it exposed for thieves or reschedule the delivery. Yep pretty much overall a fail.",2,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"Let's start with the home-integration elephant in the room: this kit doesn't support Alexa integration. If this is a thing you're after, look elsewhere. It does support Amazon Key, however, though I didn't use this feature myself, and can't report on it.If you're simply looking for a smart app for your iPhone or Android device that will act as an extra garage door opener, a garage door state checking tool, and a log of garage door state changes, this is a great solution. Easy to install, requiring only a power outlet and a remote digital ""level"" that attaches via Velcro (or screws, if you like) to your garage door. Ours installed in minutes, and works splendidly. Be aware that the system supports one master account and three ""guest key"" accounts -- if you plan to share access with more than four people in total, and individual accounts are needed, this may be a dealbreaker for you.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"I got this because I often forget if I've closed the garage door or not, and it's a source of stress when I am away from my house. I was very happy with the hub initially, but I had a few glitches with the app not showing the correct state of the garage door in the month that I had it, which made me unsure if I can trust the hub.The App support FAQs were not helpful, so I finally called the MyQ Support line, and they helped me figure out the problem. It appears the hub was installed too close to the motorhead, which can create interference with the hub and thus provide false readings. The hub was installed by ""expert installers"" via Amazon, so I was a bit annoyed since I had to re-install / re-configure the hub myself again while MyQ Tech Support talked me through it (very excellent service, BTW).",4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"I've been using the My Q app on existing doors (with Chamberlain openers) on my main house and have loved it. In an adjacent building I have an old Genie Opener and no reason to replace it but envy the notifications from the main house when a door is left open and the ability to open them remotely. When I first saw the MY Q Smart opener its price and the unknowing of how it would be compatible kept me at a distance. When it was available for under $20 during the 12 days of christmas it was a risk worth taking.Installing it took less than 30 minutes, programming it was a breeze and it even recognize the Genie opener without having to pair the with the remote.  At it current price ($29)it is a no brainer and even with the full price it can be a great control for any home. You can even operate two openers with one hub (Just buy the extra door sensor). Only thing I wish it had was a automatic door close timer. It supposedly works with IFTTT so I may create a program to achieve that. Just make sure you have strong wifi. Great Product.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Has great promise but poorly implemented and a bit annoying in operation.  In operation it's yells like a dying cat, but the software is the worst problem.  Just could be so much, but isn't.  Schedule is really lame.. ok. I can set a schedule for 10pm to close the garage in case it's open, but how about auto close the garage door if it's left open (like other non ""smart"" devices.  Also it seems like smart home integration (for me Google Assistant) is limiting to STATUS , and CLOSE.  You can't tell Google to open your garage door.. for ""security reasons"".  All in all just disappointed by what could be a great product.  On top of that,  an Amazon Prime delivery truck drew up with a package just as I was installing. The driver had never heard of the product. Said, ""Only 2 companies in his warehouse use the feature"" whatever that means.. so the main purpose of buying it,  having Amazon deliver packages to the garage does not seem to be universally supported.",2,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0

"Easy to install. Basically it is just another clicker, programmed into your exisitng opener. Connected it to my 14 year old and 20 year old openers. I did buy whole kit for each door, cause they were cheap. Took just a few minutes to make it work. Took longer to screw mount to wall then program. Note: I know how to install IOT devices and learned to keep eveything on your 2G radio, do not use your 5G radio during installation. After install move your device/phone/tablet back to your preferred SSID. Everything will work fine. Also, I just happened to have a Network Extender in my garage to provide steonger network to my driveway cameras amd fron door lock. Maybe $40 for the added extender, running on 2G , but I get awesome wifi in garsge area. Bottom line, this worked better than I expected, Works with Alexa. But I usually use the MyQ app, and skip Alexa.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"This is super easy to install and does give accurate status updates on your garage from anywhere you can access the internet.  The remote control opening and closing feature is not as reliable as I had hoped.  I have had to unplug and replug it in a couple times to get it to reconnect and work properly.  Not exactly ideal when you want to use it to access your house.  Also, it has almost zero connectivity to voice assistants.  I paid to connect it to Alexa and all it can do is give a status of the garage and I think maybe close it.  It won't open the garage because they are afraid of having any liability if someone figures out how to hack it.  I find that frustrating because I was hoping to be able ask Alexa to open the garage if someone arrives.**UPDATE  After further thought I am even more frustrated with the fact this won't let me open my garage with my voice assistants (I have both Google and Alexa) simply because the company is afraid of that feature.  Paying to connect it is not worth it because I could just open the app to get a status update.  I really only wanted it connected to open the door hands free without getting up.  MyQ deserves a bad reviews for this because they completely avoid addressing this issue  and have made no attempts at fixing it or telling those of us with their openers already if they plan to fix it.  If nothing else, have people sign a release of liability if you are so afraid of people using the voice assistant to open the garage.",3,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
"Installed easy enough, but Chamberlain forces you to take extra steps (namely IFTTT) to get working with Alexa.The door sensor is unreliable and uses an odd sized battery that isn't easy to find. When my battery went dead I ordered and replaced it, but it continued to tell me that the battery was low for several weeks. I did the ""battery test procedure"" several times but it took about 6 weeks to get it to recognize that I had replaced the battery... now the sensor will randomly stop working so the opener thinks the door is open when it has been closed, or that it's closed when it is in fact open... making it impossible to operate remotely.",1,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0

"I e had this product for about a year and a half. At first, it was great. Worked wonderful. Then after about 6 months we started having issue. I blamed my wifi connection and tried resetting everything. That went belly up so I gave up, removed it and stuffed it away in my toolbox. Recently, my street had some vehicles get broken into. The thieves used the garage door openers tonipen a few garages. Eventually they stole my neighbors car and left. Well, that prompted me to want to install cameras and reinstall my MyQ hub. We also had installed eero wifi so i had a strong signal in the garage now. Reinstalled everything as if i was starting from scratch. Everything once again was working great. About a week ago i get a notice that the battery is low in the sensor so I get a new battery and change it. I do all the tests it tells me too and i see says it can take up too 6 cycles of the door to change the low battery message. Well, it's been a week, door has cycled at least 4 times or more a day, and it still says low battery. Also, it's not reading properly. Says door is open when its closed wont close the door when I press the button. This thing has been a big pain in the butt.",1,1,2019-8-28,1,0,1
"I've tried to set up the myQ account (name, location, password) and it only comes back saying the server can't be reached.  I've tried both using my wifi and direct LTE on my Google Pixel 3 FI. Same results. There is no option to set up the account through a PC web browser. A Google search showed that this to be a periodic problem, but I'm blocked from setting it up until this outage has passed.  I'll wait a day, but I'm already considering sending it back.Update:  On maybe the 10th try I got tired of typing/copying in the long complex password and so I just put in a fairly simple password.  It went right through.  I suspect that my ""can't connect"" error was actually a password it didn't like even though the web page said it was fine.  The next steps had no less than three different instructions on how to layout the hub and the sensor: one in the booklet, one in the app and a third one in a video pointed to by the app.  I now don't think the differences really matter but I mistakenly tried to reposition the door sensor due to the ""new"" instructions and messed up the velcro adhesives and had to dig up some of my own (which I luckily had).  Overall the myQ seems to work fine, but the whole process left me feeling less than confident that this thing will work well over time.",3,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0
"It does not work with Alexa, it works with Google (you can ask if your garage door is open or closed).  You can only open the garage door from the myQ app.  There is no feature for you to have the Garage door open automatically when you drive up.  Using IFTTT you can have the garage door close automatically when you leave home.  It's ok just not as good as I thought it would be.  That is probably why the price is so low.  The MyQ app allows you to set up a schedule and alerts so their app is useful send works well so far.Update 3 months later.  Well it's not working so good lately, sometimes it loses the status of the garage door (says open when closed, or closed when open).  Yesterday when I came home it did not record that the door was closed.  When I went out for a walk I had an IFTTT routine that closes my garage door when my phone disconnects from WiFi, since MyQ thought the door was open it executed the routine to close the door but since the door was already closed it opened it instead.  I thought this was a nice feature but since the MyQ does not track the state of the garage door accurately it looks like I will not be able to use it.",1,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"When it works , it works great and is a big plus in managing my garage doors. I have a three car garage with three separate doors. So I purchased two devices plus one extra door sensor (each device can handle two doors). It also offers integration with Amazon Key, an Amazon app that connects with myQ to allow packages to be dropped off inside your garage. And it will push notifications at once.Sounds great? Well, as long as the device stays connected to the internet. Sometimes, for no apparent reason, and I’m tech savvy, the device disconnects and won’t reconnect on its own. You are then left with starting the installation all over again except that it seems to retain partial information that interferes with a clean setup. I had to reset the device to factory setting and delete the app several times before it works again. That’s a hassle and a disappointment.",3,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0

Super easy to install and the step by step setup was the most detailed and easiest I’ve ever encountered.  Bonus is the Amazon Key integration, having packages delivered into my garage instead of left on my doorstep for thieves.  Just love it.Update:  It was super easy to add a ""Guest"" user with their own notifications and ability to open/close the garage from their phone.  As far as issues, sometimes the notifications seem to be slow, showing a much later closed time than reality.  In one case by several hours. The other thing about this and Amazon Key, without a camera it is hard to trust access to the garage so we disabled it just to be safe.  After we add another camera into the garage we will enable it again.  Its still a really great product and fully recommended.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"The Chamberlain MyQ-G0301 works just fine in my Garage, with a so-so Wireless signal strength; it does just what I needed to use my iPhone to open and close the door (and the software indicates the current door position, and how long since it last changed).  The instructions and video installation files were very good and straight-forward, and I believe they helped eliminate any concerns I had for installing this device; it was especially helpful to watch the video 2-3x, to ensure I was familiar with the different terms and steps.  I did have initial Wireless signal-strength issues to resolve in the Garage, but the Hub locked up just fine on the Router's signal, and I did not need the Wireless Extender.The original price of the MyQ-G0301 is ridiculously high, but when it came down on 'sale' -- it was a more reasonable expenditure (still not cheap, but better than buying an entirely new Garage Door Opener); I see where the older MyQ-G0201 is less expensive, but my experience is to rarely invest in older models (although it may be just as good).  I have no desire to integrate this device with Alexa or Apple Home, and therefore I expect to never be charged any monthly fees that I read about in other reviews; if the latter is true, then I'm happy with this device's capabilities.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0

"It's sorta there, but there are some strange implementation choices. For one, it supports Alexa key as a key advertising feature, yet it doesn't support Alexa native app. So I cannot build Alexa routines around this. To make things even more odd, I couldn't seem to get ifttt, Alexa, and MyQ to play nice together.Second, it doesn't allow for opening instruction to be given, at least that I found. I could close it and get it's status via Google Assistant voice command, but no open. I understand the potential security risk, but I should be able to opt in or out of my own decision. Especially when the intended use is for geofencing, so it would open when I'm putting up the street. It should give you the opening with an acceptance screen indicating the potential risks instead of just outright restricting the feature.",3,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"This does not integrate with ANYTHING other than your wifi network. They claim that it works with google assistant, but I have yet to figure out how to actually set that up. Google doesn't seem to know anything about MyQ or its existence and chamberlain actually has enough gall to ask you to pay a yearly subscription for that. To be fair they set up some sort of free trial subscription, but again google wants nothing to do with this thing (don't believe me, search for MyQ or Chamberlain in the device list for Google assistant).Again, product doesn't integrate with ANYTHING, so don't count on automation of any sort. For example, if you are driving home and want to open you garage, you need to park, unlock you phone, locate the app, open the app and then... hope that its your luck day cause you have about 80% chance of the door opening (worse if you have signal issues on your driveway).

"I'm not sure what the people did that had trouble with this.  It really is super simple!  I put the hub on a workbench in the garage, plugged it in and followed the step-by-step instructions in the app itself!  First the hub needed to connect to my 2.4g network.  No problem!  I selected the right network, gave it the password and was connected --- the same as if you were configuring your phone or computer to access.  Then the little sensor got paired with the hub by pressing the button on it a couple of times.  Final step - tell the app the brand of your garage door opener, hit the LEARN button on the garage door opener and let it do it's thing!I probably should mount the hub on the garage ceiling and plug it in the outlet that the garage door opener is plugged into - - only so that my wall outlet is open for other things!

"Unfortunately I didn't do my research well enough before buying to realize that in order for this device to work with the Google Assistant, you have to pay a small subscription fee. The fee is very trivial but the fact that Chamberlain would be so petty as to actually collect a fee for a WiFi garage door opener is just disgusting to me. On top of that, even if you did pay the fee, it doesn't seamlessly integrate with the assistant rather you would have to ""talk to MyQ"" to find out if your garage door is open, or to command it closed etc. There are workarounds to this but it's just extra steps you have to take for a product that is provided such a simple task. Because of this we hardly get any use out of this and it's completely not worth it. There are far better options out there that work well with the Google Assistant. I can't say how it works with Alexa because we don't use Alexa but I'd recommend staying away from this one.",2,1,2019-6-25,1,1,0

FINALLY after many times of trying, it paired.......only to have it need a factory restart due to being unable to change the WIFI it was connected to. not sure if i just got very unlucky, or this thing is just that bad, but it works, so far. I've had the door close, but reopened (i dont blame the unit, our garage door is a bit old and needs a few repairs) and the app just flat out said something like it was in motor mode only or something to that effect.

"*updated 5/21/20* after months of use, unit stopped working. Customer service was no help and just blamed (my working) door opener and passed me off to them... Would not replace the myQ unit. Wish I hadn't bought this, no wonder they were giving them away so cheaply!Got this unit at a bargain price but would be happy, hindsight, paying full price. Installation was easy and worked with my Chamberlain Liftmaster (which is an odd lift I needed for my low ceiling).",1,1,2019-11-28,1,0,1
"Easy to install but the Google Home integration is terrible. The device itself will not appear in Google Home but you can create Google Assistant integration that will give you exactly one thing... the ability to say to Google to close the garage door. That's it. On top of that, Chamberlain wants you to create an account that it wants you to pay for. Right now they are waiving the fee for a year but after that... who knows. What do you get for the subscription cost? Nothing other than if you don't pay it they will disable your device. There is no technical reason for them to be involved since the communciation is between your application and the device via your internet. This is just a way for Chamberlain to make people pay them more money... and likely to steal data about them. There are other solutions that don't try to extort their customers like Chamberlain is doing. If you have Z-Wave I'd recommend the Linear/2GIG GD00Z which is excellent. Still trying to determine the best WIFI one as an alternative to the MyQ one.",1,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
Hub in ceiling connected to WiFi with no problem.  I followed the iOS app instructions exactly - place door sensor where app suggested [upper corner of door].  The unit would not pare with Craftsman opener.  I tried multiple times to get it working and was ready to send it back.My last attempt was to move the door sensor into the center portion on the right half of door [closer to MyQ hub and garage door opener] and see if it would work.  Bingo - everything fell into place!!  Unit pared with opener instantly and has been working perfectly for weeks now and love the features.,4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I'm not sure what these other people are doing, but I had no issues getting this installed and working. I have a good wifi router, so maybe that's a big part of other peoples issues? If so, that's not this products fault. That's their fault for having crappy wifi coverage. If your wifi coverage is poor in your garage, then you'll need an access point to extend the range.The setup was pretty standard for this kind of product. You open the app, run through the steps 1 by 1. Don't rush, don't skip. Do exactly what it says to do and you shouldn't have any issues.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"My son and I installed the MyQ while he was visiting us between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We followed the well-written directions and it was a piece of cake.  The unit works well and only time will tell how it holds up.  The one concern I have is the 3M adhesive that holds the garage door unit to the door.  Since my door is lightweight and not solid wood, the directions said to use the adhesive strips. Since the door moves from the vertical position to horizontal, my fear is the adhesive will lose its' grip over time and the unit will fall & break.  I know 3M makes a great adhesive so I'm expecting the best from it.  The remote works well using either my car universal or the Alexa on my phone.  I did have to re-train the car remote once the MyQ was installed (it must have lost the code when I was training the MyQ); but, that was an easy fix. Last year, when we were away traveling, our neighbor called to say our garage door had been open for three days.  Since all my power and hand tools are stored there, I was concerned.  Now, I can check on my iPhone and be assured my door is closed!",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"Although I like them, I'm weary of these kind of gadgets, so I read plenty of reviews before buying one, and this thing seemed to do it's job. After reading one review saying that you HAD to follow the instruction for an easy install, that's what I did and the install was super easy. The only hiccup was that it wouldn't sync with the opener. I finally had to call tech support and the guy said that I should erase all  my remotes so I could program this one and it worked fine after that. This should be put in the troubleshooting section in the app to avoid wasting time. I reprogrammed the other remotes after and this took a couple of minutes.The only thing that really annoys me/us is the loud beep on closing + light flashing. Can't turn this off since it's a ""safety"" feature. It would be nice to be able to use the light by itself also.",3,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Update, Day 3: Received a system text @ 8am that my garage door was closed. Appears to have pinged servers or reset itself somehow. Error has cleared and app works again. Turned out okay because I was home and could visually see the door and manually click the wall button to close/open it. If I were out of town I would have to rely on a person to check it for me since it was showing in the app as open all night.Update, Day 2: ""Close error"" in MyQ app. Nothing in the way of the sensors. Followed steps to clear the error, but it remains. Cannot use the app to close the door. Already useless.",2,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"This item serves its purpose but it needs a lot of work. The Unit will open and close the garage door...most of the time. There are some kinks that need to be worked out like if you ever have a power outage, when your power comes back on you will have to run the garage manually before you can use the hub again. That's not helpful if you are out of town for a week and the power goes out for five minutes at any point. The same goes for internet service outage. If the internet drops for any amount of time, you must run the garage manually again before using the hub.  The online account and third party linking is terribly done. First it costs additional fees, then just logging in and out of the app and website account portal is painful.  This is a decent idea but I don't think it will be long before a universal garage remote maker comes along and actually does this right...",3,1,2019-2-4,1,1,0
"Easy setup and clever product.  I've had no issues with connectivity as I have a strong WiFi signal in the garage.  However, two big issues with this product so far which are causing the 3-star rating:1) Door open/closed notifications are often seriously delayed.

He tells you the door is closed when it’s open and tells you it’s open when is close. Worked on it often on for four days with the help of tech before he even come close to operating.  The technician advised me it could be to the fact there could be an interference with the network,she listed all the items they’re supposed to be in the garage, washing machine dryer sprinkler timer lights LED lights. These items could cause an interference with the hub, Those items are what are in the garage.

Once it arrived, I downloaded the app, followed the programming instructions and installation instructions and had it up in working in about 20 total minutes from the time I opened the package to completely installed.  I have mine mounted on the ceiling immediately next to the opener and it works great.  I just got it so there may be kinks -and I will update if that happens.

Raising review score from two to four stars.UPDATE  07/21/2020: The myQ has been installed for over 6 months. It is very convenient when it works. It worked flawlessly for the first couple of months. Since then it repeatedly has suffered sensor errors. I have relocated the hub and sensor but it the issue remains. I have worked with manufacturer but the device still has issues.

"Seriously, how did we function before this?? 1. Super easy installation. 2. Awesome for those times you leave home mindlessly, out of habit, and then wonder...did I close the garage door?? No more driving back to check. 3. Our garage is used for our golf cart, etc...we don't park in it....meaning our cars are always in the drive. You should NEVER leave a garage door opener in your car, in the drive (all someone has to do is break in your car, then they can open your garage!) We used to always carry our openers with us, such a pain!! Not anymore, not with this...we just open/close with our phones. We don't even need the openers anymore.

"Headline explains it all. I bought this on sale, but it went on a bigger sale a few weeks later...I can see why. This thing is over priced for what it is. The installation is super easy and the in-app instructions are very clear. I knew going in there was no Alexa integration (without a hack), but I expected the app that controls the door to be better/more reliable. First, there were 2 apps with the same exact name! They eventually retired one of them (the better working one!). Now for the lone app thats left, I sometimes hit the button and it works or doesn't work...I just hope for the best. I wish they could make it work more consistently. I'm doing it right outside my garage door when these problems happen and I have a Orbi 3000 whole home mesh system too...i know the wifi is strong all around. Another thing to note is the thing beeps very loudly when closing the garage door, as to warn folks. The garage door opener is already loud enough as a warning don't you think? This is a $20 device at most, but they charge way more. I'm too lazy to return it and look for something else as I don't use this that much.",2,1,2019-7-12,1,0,1
"I have been using the MyQ Smart Door Opener for two and a half months, and am very happy with it!  My wife and I have each left home, leaving the garage door open on occasion.  It is nice to be able to set event alerts such as the amount of time the garage door remains open.  It is really nice to be able to close it remotely from anywhere!  It's also handy to open it remotely if necessary.  At first I had WiFi issues and lost connectivity to MyQ every few days, and had to reboot my WiFi router.  I discovered other devices weren't connecting to WiFi either when that happened.  I tried a WiFi range extender and that didn’t help either.  My solution was to replace my old traditional WiFi router and range extender with a eero Pro 3-pack mesh router.  That product is amazing, and resolved all my WiFi issues.  I now have a strong WiFi signal that is almost as fast as a wired port, on each level of my home, and there have been zero interruptions.  I haven’t had MyQ connectivity issues since installing the eero!  The MyQ app for iOS works great, provides garage door status, and allows setting alerts by notification and email.  It also stores history of the garage door opening and closing cycles. Notifications show when the garage door is opened or closed by someone else. The MyQ Smart Door Opener is a reliable and affordable solution for monitoring and remotely operating your garage door, and offers peace of mind.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
I bought this because a reviewer said it integrated with Google Home.  WRONG!It is very very easy to install.  Could not be any easier.  Well done on that front.  And it works just fine with the MyQ app.  But that is the ONLY way to get the garage door to work.  Even the Google assistant can only open the app.  And zero integration with Google Home.,2,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I bought 2 units and 2 extra door sensors to control a total of 4 doors...after a couple tries and moving the main unit around it worked pretty well. The only issue I really would like to see is improvements within the app.  I do appreciate the alerts, and It works good if you are controlling one door, but if you need to open or close multiple you have to wait until one is finished before controlling another or the app freaks out and causes errors.  If you  are too impatient you get to set up all your doors again. I contacted support and they were helpful...although they didn’t know you had to wait for one to finish before operating another..but unfortunately that seems to be how it works.  While it seems silly to complain about this, it’s kind of a waste of time to stand and wait 20 seconds for the door to finish and the app to read that’s its complete.  I seem to have to force stop the app a lot and reopen it.  Even signing in seems to take a lot longer then you would expect...all in all it works but feels clunky.",3,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Update to my initial review. Both myself and my friend 30 miles away have had random garage door openings - my friend in the middle of the day and myself at 11PM (good thing I was awake and noticed it) and also one time in the morning while I was away on a trip. If you search, you will find others that have the same problem. FOR YOUR SAFETY, I can no longer recommend this product or ANY Chamberlain opener with MyQ controls.I have an older Sears garage door opener and this was a super easy addition for my smart home.  I use Samsung Smartthings.  It doesn't integrate with Smartthings natively, but adding it as a device is easy.  My only dissatisfaction is that there is no native support for Smartthings AND Chamberlain charges $10/year to allow IFTTT integration.  However, it is easy to add a tilt sensor and a Smart App to avoid this charge.  There were other alternatives that worked natively with SmartThings, but they had terrible reviews - both in reliability and actually charging for tech support - and they were actually more expensive than Chamberlain.  I now have routines that will ensure the garage door is closed every night and also close automatically when I leave.  Plus, I have confirmation that the door is actually closed (or open), and I can open it for someone from any place in the world.",5,1,2018-1-31,1,1,0
I installed the MyQ hub and two garage door sensors for my daughter. The installation was straightforward and so far everything is working well. She has the MyQ app on her phone and can check the status of the doors remotely. She shared access with her husband so he can do the same.I installed the MyQ hub and a single door sensor in my own home. It also works well for me even though I received a low WiFi signal alert during installation. The only problem I've noticed is when I use a doorbell button next to my garage door to open or close the door. The MyQ app has the door status wrong after using the doorbell button once. It does however recognize the correct status after I use the app to open or close the garage door.,4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"If I had it to do over again, I think I'd just replace the entire garage door opener.  That said, this unit CAN be figured out, but it wasn't the easiest process for me.  I've looked all over, and for the life of me, can't seem to find any documentation that mentions a brown learn button on a Chamberlain opener.  For about a month, I gave up on being able to control the unit with MyQ, and was monitoring only.  Fearing that my opener had exhausted it's allowable number of remotes, I erased all of the codes and reprogrammed all of my remotes.  THAT DID NOT FIX MY ISSUE.  Having only 5 color choices in the programming mode, I decided that I'd run through all of them before boxing this thing up and sending it back.I don't know if it was coincidence or not, but when I tried to program as a purple learn button, it worked like a charm, and it just so happens that my antenna wire was purple.",3,1,2019-4-30,1,2,0

"I really like the product but users are faced with discovering how it operates.  I would have given 5 stars but the documentation is so poor that I have to drop the score.To see what I mean, look at the photo and product description and see if you can figure out what the LED light on the unit is for.  It appears that the light may turn on when the door operates. Partly true.  The light does NOT turn on when opening the door.  Nor does the light turn on when pushing the light button on the hub.  However, the light DOES flash to alert that the door is about to close and then an annoying audible alarm sounds as the door moves and for about 10 more seconds AFTER the door has closed. Seeing the light and the corresponding button, I thought the unit would provide light to the garage upon operation and thus I mounted the hub in a spot to take advantage of the anticipated extra lighting.  There is zero mention of an audible alarm upon closing the door, thus I thought something was seriously wrong when my wife closed the door and the alarm remained on.",4,1,2018-12-4,1,0,0
I have 4 issues with the product.The hub has a very loud warning alarm when the app is used to close the Garage. It seems to be a issue with other people on the web also.

Some bedrooms have a  common wall with the Garage. Therefore I can't use at night. Update: Made a enclosed box with soundproof material from a Hillshire farm 33 oz cold cut container.

"MyQ smart garage opener works with my garage opener, so I am quit happy with this.  No more having to run down stairs to open the garage door for the water softener rental people.  The setup for of the physical devices was pretty simple. However software setup was a total mess.  The MyQ app didn't recognize the MyQ opener and I had to go through numerous tries and resetting the MyQ opener to finally get the app to find the MyQ opener.  Once that was complete the rest of the setup was pretty straight forward.  I didn't find any documentation in the package to instruct how to setup the MyQ opener.  The only instruction was to download the MyQ app.  So there was a lot of confusion on what I need to do to setup the MyQ opener with my garage opener.

After some careful thought and a great deal on black Friday, I decided to give it a shot.The other reviews suggested to follow the instructions very carefully and make sure you have a strong wifi signal in your garage, so that's what I did too. In downloading the app (which is easy to use and is packed with features), the app instructed me through the install process step by step. I'm a pretty handy guy and somewhat technical about smart home devices, but by no means an expert. In sticking closely to the instructions, the install went easily and without incident, and this product is now working perfectly for my garage doors.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I wanted a way to ensure that my garage door was closed when I’m away. This device does that. But setting it up was not easy, requiring several factory resets after which the device/app would skip entire steps of the setup. I’m a fairly experienced connected home user, and this is the worst I’ve seen as far as consistent performance and ease of set-up. It’s also rather pricey for what it provides- meaning that this device could also work with Apple HomeKit, but instead requires another pricey device added to this one. No thanks.Once it was connected and working and installed, a power outage caused it to go offline and then it refused to connect properly, even after several resets. Finally I uninstalled the device from the ceiling and tried again. Lo and behold it connected! So I installed it permanently on the wall near my kitchen door. No trouble since then.

"I had high hopes, but it turns out that this remote is not compatible with my opener. This boggles my mind because how hard would it have been to have terminals on it for contact closure? If it had contact closure, it would be compatible with literally every opener ever made by including 3' of wire in the box.The biggest disappointment isn't in the fact that they couldn't put a couple of sets of dry contacts in it, which I could wire into my opener in parallel with the button on the wall. The biggest disappointment is that despite the fact that it can notify me that my door is opened or closed, it cannot use either of those states to trigger an Alexa routine.

I also found the step-by-step install instructions on the app to be very detailed - they worked for me without any hiccups.Yes, integration outside of the Chamberlain proprietary ecosystem is pretty much non-existent out of the box (I use Amazon's Echo / Alexa, so no can do even if I were willing to pay an extra fee, which I am not.) For $30 however, you can open and close your garage from almost anywhere in the world, get useful push notifications if you forget the door open, set it to close automatically at certain times of day or night...

Then stick the small box on the top most part of your door and it works. I programmed the app to check for my door being opened at regular times in the evening. It alerts me and closes the door at those times on its own. It also notifies me throughout the day if it’s open. It’s unfortunate that this doesn’t work with Alexa, but I like it better than the other unit I purchased for my other door that can.  Overall, this unit is easy to install (because of that little box you stick on the door that lets you know if it’s open or not) and just does what I want it to.  Wish I would have gotten this on the other door too! The other Alexa enabled unit requires bracket installation for two parts that come together to see if the door is open instead of  to this nice box) I’m still having to mess with it.

In this instance, I can see that the sensor is no longer fully vertical (like when the door is fully closed, and when door is fully opened the sensor is fully horizontal).

I read that some had issues installing it. Follow the instructions and it's done in 20 min. This works great for deliveries and also tells me if I left the door open. Then I can close it from accross town. I also read that the door would open by itself. Not once has that happened to me. I am very happy with what I purchased and highly recommend it.

Only after the installation did I realize it can not work with Alexa. The listing is very misleading and not being compatible with Alexa is not clearly noted - but it is sort of implied.

I always have this fear that I might have driven off in a hurry and forgotten to close the garage door (been there and done that)...or walked into the house after going to the mail box and forgotten to close the door (been there and done that as well). With this device I can easily look at the app and tell whether it is closed or open and how long it has been in that state. I can then easily close it if necessary or when my son comes over I can open the door from wherever I am. The laser is great in making sure I don't pull my car in to far and hit some of my tools or other stuff that sits near the front of the car. I have not done Alexa integration yet. It can also be tied into my house security system which I have not had done yet.

Will update if sent back.Update: 2 weeks in what I was worried about happened. My wife left for a couple hours and came back and the garage door was wide open. She said she watched it close when she left (because we still didn’t trust this thing 100%). I checked the app and it was totally frozen on the “close error” screen which is what I was getting when I was setting it up and trying to get the hub as close to the door sensor as possible (instructions said 6-8 feet, yeah right!). It worked for a cpl weeks because the hub is literally a cpl feet away but even with that the hub and sensor failed to communicate. Due to the fact that the garage being open is basically a welcome to our empty house sign I can not use this device with confidence.

This way there are no surprises and you are prepared to do the install. Some tips: A strong WiFi signal is a must and when you pair DO NOT try to pair it to your 5G network! The 2.4 only! A full fan icon or down one bar is ok. You do not have to mount the hub in it’s to be permanent location YET.  Not until the end. I paired my hub in my home office where the router was within 5 ft. Next ensure you’re garage door opener is compatible, the vast majority are, and if any questions, call Chamberlain. I had heard you can pair only five remotes at a time and I already had five paired, the cars, the original visor remotes, and a keypad. So I emailed Chamberlain support and found out that my opener, a LiftMaster Professional 1/3hp, dated 2007 can support up to 8 remotes. No problem, I lucked out. Note that Craftsman, and LiftMasters are made by Chamberlain. Download the app first. Set up your new account and password if necessary. Then go through the terrific setup process using your phone app. I’m a bit of a handyman, so using my cordless drill and the hardware supplied, and my 6’ garage ladder, I finished the installation with no glitches. Then I tested everything, the app, the car, the keypad, and the indoor wired button. No issues. Yes, there is a really annoying beep that goes off when closing the door USING THE APP ONLY.  There is more than one way to go at disconnecting the speaker by looking on the web. Or take a piece of black wiring tape and put it over the speaker holes to diminish the volume. It’s not as loud as I thought it would be, but I’ve already told neighbors it is NOT a smoke alarm going off. There should be a way to control the volume in the app, but there are probably a lot of CYA’s in play here. I have a very smart home that is anchored by Alexa and the Smart Life non-hub app with a ton of bulbs and plugs, routines, and skills. The Chamberlain IS NOT Alexa compatible, at least not yet. It is compatible with Google and the Internet of Things, and there is NO LONGER a subscription required to use the two aforementioned items. If you have  Home, you will need to buy an additional hub called Bridge that runs the opener. I have  everything but never bought into ’s smart hub and devices. Because sometimes I am dumb enough to have left the house with the door left open, I will get warning notifications and be able to remotely close the door from anywhere in the world. From my iPhone or iPad. Don’t need Alexa for that. But, the brick and mortar Amazon stores do sell this product, I guess becausethey can be setup with Amazon Key to allow deliveries to the inside of your garage. No thanks on that one. I’ll let my Ring doorbell take care of my Amazon front stoop deliveries. Hope this was helpful! If this product screws up down the road, I’ll let you know!",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"The hardware and the App itself are very easy to install and navigate.  If you have some basic tech knowledge, then you should not have any issues with this setup.  I use Google assistant in my home which was the primary motivator for me to get this system.  But be forewarned this system will NOT open the garage door by using google assistant/home.  It will only close the door.  Which I have read has to do with security measures, but for me, the lack of this feature has been very frustrating.  I have considered returning the system for the lack of this feature.  I'm hopeful that Chamberlain and Google can fix this issue because as more homes transition to higher degrees of integrated Smart Home features this should be a no-brainer.",4,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"It was easy to install and works just fine.I wish the app would let me add other household members as primary users. Instead, I have my wife's phone app logged into the same account as mine.  Not sure if that will cause any problems.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"It works, but the wifi reception is terrible.  I mounted it  according to the instructions and pairing took about 10 minute to complete due to quite a few retries.  Once completed I found it to be intermittent due to the wifi reception.  While my phone had very good reception  to both my router and repeater  from the opener, the MyQ didn't.  I removed the MyQ from the garage ceiling and brought it into the house.  From there it worked, but I then found that when you activate the MyQ, it flashes and does a loud series of beeps as an alert. This was not going to work inside the house.  I relocated it to the far end of the garage and the reception there is working.  All is well now, except I need to fill in the holes in the ceiling from the first install.  I suggest you do the pairing, and try using the app, before you attach this to your ceiling.",3,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"I've been wanting one of these forever. Finally broke down after a night of drinking and bought it. After the hangover the next morning I went out and installed it. Super easy!! Few touch of some buttons, and this thing pretty much programed itself. Took about 10 minutes after watching a YouTube video.  I have a lot stuff in my garage that I I use for rental properties, and I back in a lot to load my truck. I' m always driving off leaving the door open. I installed  a camera in the garage so I could see if I left it open after I got across town, which I do all the time. Now I can shut it from anywhere and don't have to drive home and close it. Best investment in a long in a long time.",5,1,2018-8-17,1,2,0
"Ever get that feeling after you left home that you're not sure if you closed the garage door.  What do you do, turn around and check to be sure.  Well I started to solve this problem by installing a Wyze cam in the garage.  That was great but what if the garage door was open.  Drive back, call a neighbor or instead use this device along with the app and close the door from where you are at.  You can also use Amazon Key app to have packages delivered inside your garage instead of the front door, I didn't connect to it so do not know how well it works.  Set up is very easy, there is a You Tube video if you need help but the instructions will suffice for most people.  The device is simplistic and inexpensive and does what it is intended for.  Did I leave my garage door open?  Yes.  Hit the close button on the app. on your phone. Done. Beautiful.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"This product was fairly easy to install so that is not the problem. The problem is how often the product goes offline and require a manual reset. Because it sits on top of the door, it requires that I have to put a ladder up to do a hard reset because the wifi would lose connection and the product goes offline which means it becomes useless and a brick. I think that if it is more consistent it can be a useful product. For now, it seems gimmicky at best and unreliable.",1,1,2020-7-8,1,1,0
"I have youngsters live in house that forgot to close garage door several times, I want to install smart garage opener that can detect and close the door remotely.  I come cross with MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener.  Installation is straight forward and youtube video help in that process step by step.  It took me about 30 minutes to install.  So far so good.  Then the next step is to connect to the WiFi.  The instruction is not very clear but I manage to get it connected and work.  The next one is to program the opener with my garage door opener unit.  It went successfully in the first try.  I think I am done.  Then my come home but can't open the garage door with her opener in the car.  I try every remote in other cars, keypad and spare one.  Nope, nothing works.  I think OK, let;s re-program them all.  So I did and verify all remotes work, except this smart garage door opener though phone App.  It lost the programming.  I re-program it again and verify it works again.  And then was shocked other remotes were stop working again.  After I re-program all other remotes, this one lost the program again.  It does sense the door status so I just leave it like that and just use it as monitor.  Come on, how can you have a product will cause other remotes not pairing any more?",2,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"Works as advertised. No issues, I can only speculate that others who are having problems are actually dealing with weak WiFi issues and/or interference from LED lighting in their garage(s) which is not the fault of Amazon or Chamberlain.One thing that was not clear until I started installing the garage door sensor is that it also has the option to be directly screwed into the door versus adhensive tape on a Velcro strip. Sticky tape of any kind never works long term in my climate, too much hot/cold extremes certain times of the year. I screwed my garage door sensor onto one of the metal flanges that connects the door panels together instead of mounting it directly on the door. This flange is offset from the door a bit so if you want to screw the garage door sensor on the door instead of using adhesive Velcro strips you do not have to worry about putting a hole thru the door.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I wrote a review on the hub previously, this is on the second door sensor.  The disappointment with the hub is that it does not work with Google Home (even though it says it works with Google), that the integration with Google Assistant is awkward and incomplete, and that there is no integration with Alexa, except maybe with IFTT, which would also be incomplete.  The second door sensor at first failed to pair with the second garage door motor.  The only way to try again was to clear the hub and reinstall both door sensors.  Then, in order to control the doors, I had to delete the app, turn off my phone, turn the phone back on and reinstall the app.  Then, when I ordered one door to close, the other one opened.  Tech support said this was ""cross-talk"" and to wipe out the memory on the hub and both motors and reinstall everything, meaning that the cars, handheld remotes and outside pin pads all had to be reprogrammed too. All of the issues were immediately and correctly flagged by tech support, but there were no answers in the written troubleshooting FAQs. Now, everything works but Alexa and Google home are still not allowed to open the doors, and the seemingly simple option of closing all doors is a multistep process that should be a one step process. It seems that there must be a better solution out there.",3,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
Product was fairly easy to install. Took a couple of attempts to get the software/application to work but once it linked properly it was since worked. Had this product for several months and works great! Thought I left my garage door open after leaving home and simply checked myq garage application which indicated that my garage door had been closed. Such a nice comfort to know I can check the status of my garage remotely. Love this product. Did have to replace the hub battery that attaches to the garage door once but I do use the product quite frequently. Highly recommend this product to anyone who uses Amazon because now I get all my Amazon purchases “in home” delivered. Never again do I have to worry about package thiefs thanks to Amazon key working with myq product. Such peace of mind!!!,5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"In a nutshell - it was east to install, works as expected, and two neighbors want to buy some now too.My setup included an older - yet still supported - Chamberlain garage door opener, Orbi network, and a Pixel Phone 3. My skills are average and it took less than 20 mins to install.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,1,0
"I was looking for the best device to monitor my garage door opener. I spend many days going through reviews and reading online articles.  Since we are huge Amazon fans and based on the reviews, we purchased the MyQ. The initial set up is very straight forward and easy. It did take me two tries to pair the MyQ with my garage door opener but after that is was smooth sailing.  Once you set up the app on your phone you can monitor and get alerts for when your garage door is open and closed. Once you have it set up you just look on your phone if you are unsure if the door is open or closed. Have not had any issues with door opening or closing by itself.  This device is great for kids as well so they can come and go as they want without a key. You can also set this up for a guest to use if you want.We have not used the in garage delivery available with Amazon but if you have a problem with packages disappearing you may want to give it a try.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"The main problem with this product is the enclosed documentation is insufficient in providing you with setup instructions.  I fortunately learned you needed the bridge unit to enable interaction with a smart phone, before making the purchase.  So, I ordered both and my first problem was getting the two units to talk to each other, although I had all four Wi-Fi bars showing in the garage.  This precipitated my having to contact customer support.  My first attempt ended up with me asking the agent to call me back as I was talking to her on my iPhone and also needed it to perform the setup actions.  She never called me back.  The 2d attempt ended with the agent disconnecting just when I was telling him the unit is now working but my car and garage door keypad had stopped.  Not a problem, I was able to get everything working but then it didn't work :-)  So, I called the 3d time and was almost there but the agent said they were doing about to do system maintenance and to give the system time to reboot.  Well....at this point I had spent about 6 hours on this - taking leave from work to do it.  My wife came and in said ""Honey, I know this is something you wanted but it's problem time to throw in the towel.""  Which I did and sent both this unit and the bridge unit back to Amazon and have Overhead Garage Door coming today to install a new garage door opener which has the smart phone function built in.  I would also advise the company to make a unit which, both, makes your garage door ""smart"" and gives you the smart phone interface as well.",3,1,2018-10-12,1,0,0
"This device had just one job: open and close the garage door reliably. It doesn't do it that well. Here are some problems in the 11 months I've owned this thing. When you put all these together, it negates any convenience benefit you might have otherwise gained. To me this makes it not worth even the low price they sell this at. I'm pulling it out next weekend.1. Problem - Google Assistant integration is very unreliable. The biggest advantage for owning a device like this would be to tell your smart assistant to open or shut the door. Everything else, such as notifications or the Amazon Key integration is nice, but secondary. If it doesn't work with a smart assistant, you're not much better off than if you had just used your clicker.

The install went well and insructions were clear. Connected to my older Liftmaster door (purple button).I was expecting that the local hub that connects to the local network/wifi would provide for basic web-based status and control or that there would be an API for the local hub.

"I bought this a little over a year ago. I was able to get it set up with a phone call to their tech support, including getting it connected to Apple HomeKit. Worked great, I could operate the door through the Home app, I could direct Siri to open and close the door, tell me if it was closed or open, etc. For some reason it stopped communicating with HomeKit after a little over a year. I called Chamberlain tech support looking for for help to figure out why it stopped working properly. They told me that they do not provide support getting it connected to HomeKit, that if their app was connecting, the HomeKit connection was an Apple problem, not theirs! After some trial and error I was able to get it figured out on my own. I bought this product BECAUSE it works with HomeKit so for them not to support that function, I find their support very lacking... so bottom line to me, this company does not stand behind their products and I will look for other options the next time. Would suggest, if you are reading this, you do the same!...",2,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0

"First, I have only 2 stars because it is not simply integrated with Google Home.

"Update. 9/24I removed one star, (probably should be two). Even though the garage door sensor is installed on the top door panel, if the garage door is partially raised and the sensor is at an angle, it will not indicate that the door is open. The door was open enough for an adult to crawl under it but still indicated it was closed. I was surprised and lucky that I checked it. The sensor unit should indicate an open door if it is not perpendicular to the floor. The attached photo shows the door open, but the app shows it closed.",4,1,2019-9-21,1,0,1

Or I can install a Garaget, and ask Google/Alexa to open the door. IFFT? It works (with a fee) sometimesCons: All of the above except: A) Using the garage door opener, or B) Using Google/Alexa to open (or tell door status) with voice.

"This product saved my marriage.  Anyone who lives with someone that leaves the garage open knows my pain. That little eye twitch when u find the garage was left open all night.

Yes, this product has changed my life. Easy to install less than 10mins. Shared the app with family, even set an alert to everyones phone when the garage is open longer than 15 mins.  Yes, it even alerts my apple watch.

I made the assumption that this implied connecting to Alexa would be a given. Silly me. In the end, no big deal. It's just another app I keep in a folder with home automation stuff in case I ever need to open the garage door remotely. Just can't do it with my voice.

It took a tier III person to get these to work for me. and she was awesome as most Tier III people are.  The Tier I customer support was awful, rude and plain wrong.  Bottom line, depending on age of your openers,  I have 2 and one much older, you  need the right device to make them work. The online descriptions make no sense. Gerry rigging one to work both is not advised and more expensive.  You just buy two of the right product.  Also, the location of these devices in garage is very very very sensitive. You have to have them in the perfect spot to work.  But now working and functioning great. Great product with poor execution.  They can fix these things.

"Works good, but caused some major interferrance with my traditional opener remotes. This was very frustrating and annoying for my wife and I, as post install it wouldn't open with the old remotes unless you pulled right up against the garage door with the car. It always worked from a good 50+ feet away from the door previous to the install. I could get this distance again by simply unplugging the MyQ unit. I tried various trouble shooting including shielding the device with mylar, and moving the door sensor piece. In the end I found that the interference was coming from the AC power plug to this unit and I needed to move the entire receiver to another location in the garage. This eliminated the interferrance while maintaining a functioning MyQ unit. I am happy now, but the installation guide really should mention this possibility. Hopefully someone having the same issue finds this review helpful.",4,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"First off it was a bit of a pain to set up. I wanted to make sure it worked prior to screwing it to the ceiling. I hooked it to the garage, and it initially opened and closed the door fine, but then went into monitor only mode. I finally taped it to the ceiling about where it was going to be installed and it started working.After it appeared to be working I screwed in the permanent mounting bracket. Later that day it started reporting that the garage door was open when it was really closed.  Then if I hit the button in the app to shut the garage door, it would actually open it. Then if I hit it again it would end up in an error state, and I would say that I have to manually open/close the door to get it to work again.",1,1,2019-4-27,1,1,0
"The claims in the description are a lie. When integrating the myQ hub with Google assistant you can only close the door or ask if it is opened. The setup process to even get that far was a nightmare. Then, rather than simply say ""Hey Google, close the garage door"" you have to instead say ""hey Google, ask myQ to close the garage door""I could get by if that was the only issue but this hub will not communicate with any devices that are connected to the same wi-fi network as the hub itself. I don't know about you, but I only have one wi-fi network at home so that means in order to even log in to the app on my phone I have to turn off wi-fi, then open/close my door, then turn wi-fi back on.

I can let people park their car in my garage, which I do often since I live downtown, and they can come back later and pick it up without me having to be there. I have only used the Amazon Key option once, but it was very convenient as well. They notify you they are there to drop off a package, you authorize them to open the garage, they place your package in the garage and take a picture, then they close the garage with the app, and take a picture of the closed garage.

There were no wires to connect it to the door opener, it does it all via wireless.My only gripes are it can't be directly controlled via Siri or Alexa (looks like you need a ""hub""), the beeper volume is way too loud (I put a piece of tape over the speaker to lower the volume), and unlike my previous Genie wifi opener, the MyQ app cannot be programmed to close if the door has been left open for a duration of time (like an hour). You can schedule it to close every day at 10pm for example, and it can be set to warn you if it's been left open, but the auto-close is a feature that should be added to the app. Genie can do it, so the MyQ should have it as well.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,1

It turned out, my Android Samsung Note 8 has some problems with it.  So I turned off my Note 8 and restart it.  God had mercy, it ran smoothly without a problem.

Or maybe I can considering that it used to exist and Chamberlain intentionally blocked it for the simple reason that they (erroneously) thought that feature wasn't making them money. Chamberlain obviously is in desperate need of a change in leadership.As for being a way to open and close your garage door from your phone and also receive alerts if you accidentally left the door open, it works great.

"Not really going to write a long review here, but I can tell you that it was beyond simple to set up. I assumed I would need to run some wiring and connect some sensors, etc. With this product, all the communication is done wirelessly. The trickiest part was finding a good spot to plug the hub in for electricity. I already have a Ring stick-up camera using a plug and my garage door motor using a plug, so I bought a simple outlet splitter to plug this hub into. Once you pair the door sensor and the hub together, you sync the hub and your garage door motor through its programmable button feature and bam! the door is connected. App is simple and straight forward. I find the product to work really well.One thing I will mention: after getting this product I figured out that it was time to move on from my obvious and easy to guess WiFi password as this IoT device now could allow access into my home. As a result, two days after I initially installed it, I tried to change the WiFi password on the device. It was way more challenging than it should have been and ultimately culminated in me performing a factory reset on the hub and re-installing from scratch.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I don’t usually have time to review stuff, but I am making time for this purchase.  I had this item in and out of my cart for 6 months and couldn’t decide if it was what I was looking for.  Some reviews were technical and I didn’t understand if it was what I needed so for the less techy people let me put it in terms that I was looking for when I was studying this product.  It’s great, we have a busy family, 4 kids plus 2 have significant others so 8 of us using the garage door.  Each person can have the app with the log in information and use it as needed.  There is no limit to how many people you give your log in information to.  Those with the log in information can see when the garage is opened or closed from wherever you are.  This also gives you the flexibility to open it for a friend and allow them to get in from where you are and you can close it again when your friend leaves.  There are 3 guest invites that you can give, let’s say a boyfriend, and then you can kick that guest off when you decide he’s not the one.  The guest log in can’t see as much as those with actual log in information.  I have no electrical experience and I installed this myself, it was not hard to install and works great for my family.  It’s not a camera, you can’t see the garage door or inside, it simply operates the garage door from wherever you are.  For my family it was the same cost as buying everyone an opener and we have a lot more flexibility.  I get notifications when it’s opened or closed wherever I am.  I can tell someone has arrived home or left.  I can tell when it’s left open at night when I’m working and close it.  I can reach over to my nightstand at 11pm and see if it’s closed when I second guess myself without getting out of my warm bed.  The app is great for us and our needs.  We love it!!",5,1,2019-2-24,1,1,0
"I got one of these for my garage, and the install is ridiculously easy.  It does everything pretty much automatically!  The instructions have you download their app, then the app walks you through.  It's literally finds the device, connects it, and you simply stick the sensor on your garage door and voila, works.  This took me about 5 - 10 minutes to install and it works beautifully.  The app is well done and really, not a single complaint from me.  You can set alerts, you can open your garage, whatever.  Well done, simple.  What more do you want?Just please, ignore the negative reviews.  Maybe the upgraded or updated or whatever, but seriously, this is a 5 minute install.  Just download the app, press the button on the device, it finds the device and that's about the end of it.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"I thought someone should mention, that if you get stuck at the ""Connecting to device..."" screen on your phone in the app when trying to install this, try choosing the ""I have a Purple Button"" option.I have a button that is actually either Red or Orange, and I tried both of those options over and over and it never connected.  Then I saw a post on the MyQ forums that mentioned trying the Purple Button option instead, and it worked right away.",3,1,2019-8-22,1,0,1
"I had seen other reviews and videos on line that said this was a finicky product to set up, but I thought it was super simple. Followed the steps on the app once applying power to the unit, and everything set up automatically and quickly on the first attempt.Very happy with this product and the ability to monitor and open / close garage door as needed.  Also the app is very good, you can set alerts to let you know it's open, for how long, in between time periods, etc.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"So I had been wanting this item for a while. Then, when I saw it discounted for prime day, I snatched it up right away. Turns out I was awaiting for nothing. I really wanted to connect it to Siri on my phone, but NOPE. If I want to connect it to Siri, that requires A WHOLE SEPARATE PART on top of the one I already bought. I have a google home too so I tried booking it up to that. Nope. I have tried so many times and I still cannot get it to connect to my google home system. They use this weird way to connect it and, surprise, it doesn’t work. If you have an Alexa, maybe it works for you, but don’t count on it connecting to anything else’s. If you use the app, it goes though the login process EVERY time you open it. And if I try to close it, it takes forever. It takes so long I get tired of waiting, find my actual clicker and just close it that way before it even starts to close it when I’m home.",2,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"I got this as a Black Friday deal. It was almost half off but knowing what I now know I would have gladly paid full price for it!  This thing is great. We got it because my teenage son leaves the house after us and he would sometimes forget to close the garage before he left. Easy to install the unit and pair with your garage door.  I would say start to finish installation took less than 15 mins. FYI...only works with 2.4ghz WiFi though. The app is simple to use and easy to set up alerts and notifications. You can open and close your garage door remotely, check the history of when the door has opened or closed and check the current status. Used this for 5-6 months and have no issues losing connection or any malfunctions with the unit. Absolutely recommend this product!",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"I rarely write a review unless a product or service is either a real stinker or a real Godsend. This Chamberlain is the latter. I have a vacation home and wanted to be able to open remotely and to give (and manage) family members access / the ability to open with iPhone versus handing out clickers. Installation took less than 10 minutes. Much easier than anticipated. App walks thru and manages each step including pairing and testing etc. No need to hard wire into garage unit. Totally wireless other than power to a standard power outlet. I have a double deep garage and that posed no issues. It operates just like my other home that came with new garage opener that had this chamberlain functionality already built in. That home proved bullet proof each time I used it. Very happy with ease of installation, user interface of app and the actual functionality and simplicity of operation. Just ordered two more for other garage doors.",5,1,2018-10-4,1,1,1
I installed this by myself. The toughest part was that the ceiling in my garage is stucco so I was struggling to drill into that surface. I adapted that by zip tying to the PVC pipe that runs some electrical across the ceiling. I’ve had it installed almost a month and I am loving this product. I was one of those that would a accidentally leave my garage door open in a rush to get out the door. So the ability to make custom alerts and close and open the door from my classroom at work is a lifesaver and huge piece of mind. Also the price is surprising- very affordable for the ease. The app was super clear during the install. I had schedule my garage door installer to put it in for me but I canceled him after seeing how easy it was to do myself. I want one of these for my refrigerator and freezer doors so someone please make that!! This product is highly recommended.,5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"It does the basic function of using your remote from anywhere to open or close your garage.  I took off a star because the directions were OK but could have been clearer.  I accidentally deleted all my remotes during the install process by simply holding down the learn button a hair too long because I didn't see a connection with the MyQ, but next time around it was OK and reprogramming my remotes wasn't the end of the world and a good reminder of how to do it.  I got it on Black Friday for $20 on sale so couldn't pass it up after a friend told me about his.  Not sure I will use the Amazon key function, too many security questions there. but I do have it set up to tell me if I my door is open for longer than 15 minutes and if I leave and get worried I didn't shut it I can always look and see and it worked out well.",4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
I bought the MyQ garage door opener from the Amazon Warehouse at a very affordable price. I wasn't sure if the item was going to be compatible because I had an older Chaimberlain drive system nor did I do any research prior to my purchase; it turns out that this remote opener IS compatible with MANY drive systems as long at your drive system has opticle eyes. (MyQ states that most systems after 1993 have opticle eyes built in as a safety feature. There is a compatibility tool on the MyQ web page if you are unsure). I had no issues with set up and it was super easy although you must have a 2.5ghz wifi signal to do so. I chose not to mount the main device on the ceiling as instructed and only set it on a shelf for now and it still works; it should still work as long as the distance from the controller is within 3-5 feet of the drive motor and plugged into an outlet.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"Turning smart devices on/off from a mobile device is a great convenience. Adding to that convenience is the ability to open/close a compatible garage door remotely takes it to the next level. Not sure if you have closed the door once you drive off? Check the app, and remotely close it. A friend wants to drop off an item but you're not home? Open the door remotely. A very handy feature to say the least. Although it is able to integrate with Google Home or Alexa, a subscription fee is required (I think first year is free but is subject to change). I actually have no plans to integrate with Home or Alexa but still think this is a great step toward a smarter home. Installation is super easy and quick -- you'll need a ladder and drill some holes (there is workaround to the latter but do it at your own risk).",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"The installation process was painful and took nearly an hour.  The major problem was the installation wizard asked for the color of the ""learn"" button on my opener, which was orange.  After selecting ""orange"", the wizard would grind for a while and then fail.  Once it failed, I had to rescan the QR code and start all over again.  Tried it three more times before calling tech support.  Turned out, even though my button was orange, ""green"" was the right answer.  Once I chose green, MyQ setup in minutes.Aside from the installation frustration, the MyQ has been working flawlessly.  I've been able to operate the door and check its status from everywhere we've traveled.  I've since added a second sensor so both doors operate and we've setup, what I think is the best feature, a scheduled closing.  If we leave either or both doors open, at 9:00 PM, they automatically close.",5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"The device works fine, easy to setup, but has 3 really irritating ""features""1. It doesn't work with Google Assistant. That is, it ""says"" it does, but they haven't actually done an integration. What they've done is host a crappy service that you have to subscribe to then attach to your Google Assistant account. It's lame",2,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"Installed to use with a Chamberlain model C205 opener.  This is in a townhouse, so there is a lot of radio interference from the neighbors, etc.  My Wi-Fi router is in the front of the property, about 100 feet away from the myQ hub.  The only problem I had linking it to Wi-Fi was RF noise coming from four 4' long LED strips hanging right in front of the hub between the hub and the router.  I turned the lights off and it connected fine.  I was going to disperse the LEDs in the garage anyway.If you have a Chamberlain opener, you don't need the garage door sensor, just the hub.  The hub will use the opener's already installed open/close sensor.  This little tid-bit only shows up in the troubleshooting instructions I read through because of the LED interference issue I had.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"Easily installed along with programming and integration to my Liftmaster garage door opener! Looked up Youtube videos prior to receiving product and it was a better and faster process for me following installation and programming through the MyQ app! Can be used with Amazon Key if user is comfortable with Amazon having legal “quick” access to open your garage door just for deliveries of course, but having a camera that can record videos and images when motion is detected would be best!  I have seen some negative reviews though about the system spazzing at times opening the garage door with an unknown status on the App. Overall, highly recommended and will update if anything goes wrong with its intended use and operations.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"Nothing complicated here...just wanted a way to remotely open the garage door.  Bought one of the ""Used - Very Good"" condition units (heavily discounted!) that turned out to be brand new inside the box.  Great deal for me!  Install was flawless.  Just followed the instructions in the app and my Chamberlain opener was paired and working in under 15 minutes total.All in all, it's been a great experience.  I have not tried Alexa integration yet (no real need), but may try it out later.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I have been looking at the MyQ for quite some time and the price has steadily been dropping. Finally decided to purchase it when it was available on the Treasure Truck. I'm a little bummed I waited so long. I watched a few videos prior to the install and was a little apprehensive about putting it up. Finally I opened the app and it actually walks you right through the install and people took some unnecessary steps in the YouTube videos.I have a Chamberlain garage door opener but it is close to 25 years old as this point. My garage is a 2.5 car detached garage that is quite a bit from the house. I don't get wifi on my phone and my new laptop can barely connect so I was a little concerned but thought if it doesn't work, I'll just install a wifi extender. I have yet to have any issues though and it has worked flawlessly. I have now successfully opened and closed my garage for a friend from 50 miles away.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

"I bought this product because we occasionally left our garage door open all night and didn't want this to happen again.  It doesn't!  I setup a monitor to close the garage every night at 9:00 PM.  If it's open it closes it and sends me a notification.  If it's already closed, nothing happens.  You can also check the log to see when it was closed (or opened) to see how long since the even occurred.  I had setup an alert to let me know when it was opened but I'm not sure it's needed at this point.I followed the instructions and setup the unit in less than 30 minutes.  It was very easy and I didn't have any issues.  You can see in the pictures, I have the sensor mounted to the top panel of the garage door.  The other unit is mounted on the ceiling near the garage door opener.  During my setup, my wireless router is just on the other side of the wall from the garage so I think this help during the installation.",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,1
"OK, Chamberlain customer service contacted me after seeing my review. The conclusion was that I was shipped the wrong version of the product and/or in the wrong box. Either way, they shipped me an add-on hub that works with Apple HomeKit - so now everything works as I thought it should. So kudos to customer service. The “fix” was to add the additional hub to allow connection with HomeKit and the existing garage door opener unit. That combo shows up as an Apple HomeKit device and integrates with your iPhone/iPad/iMac. All good. All works.I still don’t understand why an additional hub device is needed as the garage opener unit could be made HomeKit compatible as it independently connects to the WiFi network. Upon further reflection, I think that if you have a recently made Chamberlain/LiftMaster garage door unit you will only need the hub unit.",5,1,2018-9-24,1,0,1
"I bought this for two reasons:  1) to be able to control the garage door with my phone, and  2) to use the feature that Amazon has for leaving my deliveries in my garage.  First, this unit paired easily with my 6 year old Craftsman garage door opener.  Installation and setup was easy and uneventful.  I am now able to open and close my garage door with my phone and I can also check to see if my garage door is open or closed.  Works very well.  One slight disappointment, although not the fault of this device is that Amazon does not offer the service of leaving deliveries in my garage in my area.  I assumed that Amazon would have this service everywhere where they make the deliveries themselves, but unfortunately, after I set it up and downloaded the Amazon ""Key"" app, I was informed that the service was not available in my area.  So you may want to verify if you have this service or not if you are getting for that reason.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"Impossible to connect. I major trouble connecting to my first router. Now I have a stronger router and it won't connect at all, not even to the MyQ let alone from the MyQ to the router. It goes into an endless loop saying it's connected to the hub the says it's lost the connection and reconnects over and over and over and over and over. Opening and closing the app doesn't fix the looping issue but restarting phone does. That gets me back to square one but eventually ends up in the same loop.It also has a weak WiFi connection even though other devices in the same area, including my phone show 4 bars.",1,1,2020-6-21,1,0,1

I was even late for an appointment once, hurried out  and got to the appointment without remembering if the door was left open , or not.  I had to call my neighbor and ask him to check.Now, I get alerts sent to my phone and email that tell me when the door was opened, or closed.  If I find that I left it open, I can remotely close it.  Most people don’t panic about leaving the door open.  Hopefully you won’t learn the hard way like I did.

"First of all, let me introduce myself. I'm possibly the only male in America that struggles with basic household chores. Want that picture hung straight? Let me take 42 minutes and still have it at a 32 degree angle.Based on some of the reviews for this garage door opener, I was as nervous as a stripper at confession about installing this on my own. When I opened the package and saw the basic instruction booklet with instructions to simply  download the app, my heart sank.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"If you plan to use Google Assistant or Alexa, don't bother. After asking for it to open the garage door, all it does is report the status of the door. I already know it's closed, that's why I said open. The one time it worked, it told me the door was closed, then opened the door about 5 inches and stopped, leaving it partially open while still saying it was closed. I bought 2 hubs on black Friday (luckily), because after an hour of trying to pair the hub to my opener, I finally resorted to opening the other one and it worked fine. But I factory reset the first hub and followed every step perfectly, and all it did was tell me it was trying to pair for 15 minutes straight and never worked. So in short, I spent hours installing it, just to tear it all down in 10 seconds when it intermittently opened my door partially without telling me. I'm returning them and I'll never but this brand again. I'm so upset I wasted my night dinking around with this junk for it not to work with Google like advertised.",1,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Although it  is easy to install, and seems to work as advertised, integration with Google Assistant is not direct.  Google Assistant calls the MyQ app, and then you have to talk to the MyQ app.  So, if you want to review the status of your home quickly (say that you're away on vacation), you have to check different apps, and it's a multistep process.Also, the connection to Google Assistant is a ""premium service,"" and while it's free now, there's no guarantee that it will continue to be subscription free.  Also, before you can use your MyQ app with Google Assistant, you have go to the MyQ website and subscribe.",2,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
The product itself is good but the Alexa integration is false. Installation was a breeze. Setting up the app was very convenient.It works reliably. I can invite friends when visiting and cancel when they leave for it to work from their phone. No more lending out my garage door openers to relatives visiting!,4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I like this. It works.  I will say also that their help line phone support is great.  They recently upgraded the app and it has some VERY non-intuitive features.  On the installation, make sure you consider the height of your vehicles so that the three way triangle between garage door opener (in ceiling) to your base unit, to the little thing you stick on the garage door itself.  That three way triangle has to have clear line of sight at all times, and AFTER door is opened (which blocked my first plan) and for would sometimes not close.  So I had to remove base unit from ceiling and put in wall, where it could see over car but not so high that is was blocked from seeing the little thing you stick on door (when garage door is open).  Was tricky.  After that, I had no more problems, except the new features they just put into app.  So, now for that, when in myQ app there is dumb icon in right upper corner of app that makes no intuitive sense.  Make sure to press it enough (works like three way toggle switch) to get the big view of your garage door icon in center of app.  If you have the other views, you will press button to open and close door, and it will put words like ""closing"" on the screen etc and look like you pressed a button, but it. WILL NOT WORK.  You must have it on a certain view to actually work.  Very dumb.  I called and reported the user interface problems to them.  So, had I just known all of the above, I could have avoided these issues.  I really like this product now and would but it again.  I'm thinking of getting a second one for my mom's garage door so I can make sure she is safe with the door closed.  I also love that you can set up scheduled closings if the door.  I have about four each evening and a couple in morning.  After people are supposed to be fine to work, school, then four more starting about 8 pm in evening, then every two hours till after midnight.  This way, in case someone leaves the door open, it will close.  It keeps record and can also notify you when these triggers happen.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0

"I got this primarily because we have on a few occasions inadvertently left our garage door open overnight. I had tried another smart-device solution that would warn me when this happened, but it didn't work well enough due to its distance from the associated hub, and because mounting contacts for a garage-door sensor is tricky.This unit does exactly what I needed. I can use my smartphone to check whether the door is closed (and to open or close the door). I have it set up to alert me on my phone when the door opens or closes, which gives me added peace of mind. The door sensor mounts to the top panel of the garage door with double-faced tape or screws (I used the latter).",4,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
"I hate leaving negative reviews but my experience with this product was bad. I set it up (which is pretty simple, so that’s a plus). Worked great the first night and the morning after! It worked for my wife as well. We used our app to control the door several times that morning, each time flawlessly.When I returned home in the afternoon, the app would not open the garage door.

It was also great that I could install it on family member phone but could the limit was 2 more.I'm updating my review, after using the unit for few months, the app on phone is crashing majority of times and I have to link the unit again to the app.",3,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"Works great!  I normally don't read the instructions before installing but this time I did.  It didn't really spell it out, but it works like the opener in your car - so the base unit hooks up to your wifi and then it has a built in remote control like the one you already have.Because of this it works with almost any garage door opener that isn't over 30 years old.  It has not had one error in over a couple weeks.",5,1,2019-5-25,1,3,0
"We had occasionally left our garage door open overnight recently because (usually I) forgot I had gone out that way when I came back into the house through another door. I was looking for a device like my father used to have, some sort of open/closed sensor with a wire that you bring into the house. If it's red, the door's open. Easy, right? Except the ones I found cost over $25, so when this went on sale for just a bit more than that, I ordered. The primary use is for it to nudge me when the door is open after 9:00pm. I also have it set to tell me if it stays open more than two hours. These both work flawlessly. I like the added functionality of also being able to open the door with my phone when I'm in the yard, making my old keypad unnecessary.I know it insists you have to mount it on the ceiling, but for my garage that would have meant extension cords for the power and the tall ladder to hang it, so I tried it on the call near where the sensor is when it opens and it has operated perfectly. The sensor is very close to the mounted unit when the door is open, which seems to be all that is needed.",5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"Set up the system and it worked for a few weeks/ months.  At times the app is slow to kick in.  And I’ve had to reset the whole system to factory and go through the setup process twice.  So it can be a real pain in the butt when you need it to open or close.  There has been a few times, I’ve hit it in my subdivision:  4 blocks away, and it’s opened.  Other times, I hit it open, and the app says open and I come to a door closed.  If you also hit the app open a few times, the door sensor tends to malfunction, and it says that I have to manually open it.  Kinda defeats the purpose of having it.  So when it works,  no complaints.  When it doesn’t, it’s a time when that feature is really counted on and it doesn’t work.  Good luck with yours...",3,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"First, the evening I tried to install and configure the myQ, NONE of it worked. And of course I was working on it after their business hours so I was just plain confused and little upset over spending what I did, only to have none of it working. That was the first night. Second, morning of the 2nd day, I tried to perform the exact same things I had done the night before, and Behold, EVERYTHING worked. Received the second door sensor this morning, and had it running within 30 minutes of going out to the mailbox to get it. So now, in less than a week, I have 2 remotely controllable door openers. Had I known that the second door sensor was required, I would have had it all done the second day I was working on it's configuration. So, if you have multiple doors, my only tip would be to get the number of extra sensors for your myQ. I only have 2 doors and the myQ comes with 1 door sensor, so I only needed one more. Am very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"Lots of stuff out there to jury rig a remote garage door opener including lasers to check if the door is open. This is a lot simpler probably because it is made by a company that makes garage door openers. You simple plug it in, tape a sensor that comes with it to the garage door and then program you garage door opener to treat it as an added remote. Then, using you wifi the garage door can be checked or controlled anywhere in the world.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0

No issues at all in the six months of use , and we have had major power outages so the electronics are well made.Saw this product on sale ($20) and jumped on it as I have been wanting something that would tell me when or if my garage door is open (particularly when in my bed upstairs). The device is extremely easy to install and setup, best of it works great.  I have used the MyQ to close/open my garage when we have left the house for walks (not having my keys). MyQ provides basic data such as when door opened or closed as well as how long in each sequence. I really like this product and can recommend it.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I purchase this knowing how many times we would get down the road and wonder if the garage door was closed, turn around only to find it closed, we now just open our phone app to see the MyQ showing door closed for a certain amount of time, it sure is a piece of mind, I also experimented with opening the garage door when I was about a mile away and again. it showed the door open. It was a breeze to install on a Genie garage door opener, I just took my laptop out in the garage and followed the instructions on it, and I didn't even have to do that as they were right on the phone after installing the app. Now the MyQ is fairly close to a range extender and I haven't had any issues with the WiFi connection but I could see how this would be an issue if your WiFi is a distance from the garage.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"The product is very good. It is easy to set up and works quite well with the MyQ app. There is some conflicting information from MyQ regarding connecting this device to your WiFi. Some literature outlines a Bluetooth connection to share WiFi information, while others outline connecting to the MyQ device first, then having the device link to the WiFi. In any event, I was able to connect the second time I tried. The directions for installation could have been clearer, but with some trial and error, I got it going.I take away 2 stars because MyQ will easily link with my Wink Hub, but will not link with my Alexa voice control. While some posters have claimed that there is a safety and security issue associated with closing a garage door, I am sceptical because I have ADT and my front door lock on Alexa and have countermeasures built in.",3,1,2018-5-23,1,0,0
"Came home from a 12 day trip and panicked. Garage door facing the street was wide open. Was someone in the house?! Had we been robbed or vandalized?! How long had it been open?!A check of the app showed it had been for an hour. No alert notification. No idea why. So thankful that was only known timeframe it was open. Woke up this morning and door was open again. No alert notification again. Pulling it out for the trash. Warranty has passed. The Numerical average customer reviewd is decent, but you can also find many instances of this happening with no help from customer service.",1,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"The installation was super easy. Just plug the main unit to power and follow the instructions on the app. The reason for the four stars is that I've only had for about 5 days and already two separate times I've pressed the close button int he app and the door has not closed. The app says closing but it never closes. Luckily I've been watching the door so I can see it's not closed and I'll close the app and retry and worked without issue. But imagine if your away from ur house and trying to close it or one of the kids forgets when they leave for school. Ur thinking the door is closed but it's open all day. But has only happened twice so far just an FYI for those buying this device.

"FYI, right out of the box, worked like a champ with the liftmaster.  I did look for compatibility, and the Genie 2028 did show as compatible.  Apparently, with Genie, this means that you can monitor the position of the door, but despite multiple efforts with both Chamberlain and Genie support people, I could not get it to pair to motor to control open or closing of door itself.Chamberlain says contact Genie.  Genie says ""It's not our product; we offer ZERO support"" (said with an attitude, BTW).  So very frustrating when no one wants to help, always pointing the finger.  Chamberlain people were most helpful via support, but still could not get it to work.  ANYONE out there who did get it to work  with a Genie 2028 I would love to know how.",4,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Make sure to download the app first.  The app is also a guide for the hardware install and Wi-Fi connection  with easy to follow the step by step instructions and videos.My big gripe... when using the app to close the garage door there is an led flashing light to warn anyone that may be under the door that it is about to close.  There is also an loud, annoying high pitched beeping to also warn that the door is about to close.  The flashing light and beeping last for several seconds to the point where you begin to wonder if the door is ever going to actually start closing.",4,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0

I had another remote garage opener which died after a year with a known failure issue.  It was great while it lasted.  I’ve been looking for a replacement and saw this one which was  fraction of the price.  I read many negative reviews as well but mostly about subscription pricing.  While I was hoping it would be integrated into Smart Things it wasn’t a deal breaker.  I chose this unit because it supported my Chamberlain LiftMaster garage motor and it was so easy to set up. I followed the instructions and within minutes it was connected and installed.  It was much easier to install and setup over my previous unit.  I hope this lasts for a long time. So far I love it.,5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0

"Bought this item yesterday had it delivered last night and tried to set it up. I was in the same room and within 10 feet from my wireless router set up failed 3 times before finally linking up to the network. It comes with garage door tilt sensor that is supposed to let you know if the door is up or down and so far it has yet to update the the door has been opened and closed 5 times but the app is showing door has been closed for 14 hours. The instructions are horrible finding an actual ""instruction manual"" is painful.So far today I spent 45 minutes going back and forth thru the automated customer service menu's ended up having to disconnect due to being stuck in what seemed like an infinite loop of crap.

"You can check to see if the door is opened or closed, and open or close the door, via smartphone on the MyQ app.  It doesn't really connect to Google Home, but you can link to Google Assistant.  I couldn't find a way to link it to Alexa. When linked to Google assistant, it doesn't have the full functionality of the app.  As in, you can't open the door. You have to go back to your myQ app for that. On the plus side, you can schedule it to close the door at multiple times, in order to get around housemates who constantly leave the door open. I think I would have been happy with the product if the limitations in linking with home assistants were clear, for example, it it said doesn't work with Google, instead or works with Google, but then I would not have bought it.  Knowing what I know now, I would have shopped for something with better integration with home assistants. As far as installation goes, I had to uninstall and reinstall the app.  It would have been easier if this was something noted in troubleshooting, but I had to call technical support to find out. It seems like it is a few years behind.",2,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0

"I love the concept of this and so far it has worked with a few hiccups.  First:  while I couldn't find documentation, apparently there is a limit to the number of devices that can control my craftsman unit.  I believe it is four.  As I was going through the setup which is very easy in my opinion, I couldn't get my motor unit to connect to the MyQ.  I found how to reset the motor unit and was able to make it connect.  later in the day I got a close error which is supposed to be from something obstructing while closing.  That didn't happen so not sure why I got the error.  I could not get it to reset so I called technical support.  They ended up doing a factory reset and got it to work.  The next day I started adding my other remotes back and for some reason the MyQ lost connection to the motor unit.  I tried several resets per the app instructions and couldn't get it to work so again called tech support and they quickly helped me get connected again.  Getting other family members connected was very easy.  My issue now is that I have a wireless keypad that I cannot get to connect to the motor unit.  I have tried multiple times and ways to reset and it will not connect.  I do have at least one other remote connected so I don't think it is at the limit.  Overall I think this will be a good product and I hope they continue to fix some of the glitches.",3,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
"This product is very good considering the intended function of the device. The installation and app setup was very easy. The Alexa integration and overall smart home assistant functionality could be better. The alarming when the garage door is closing is annoying and unnecessary, in my opinion. I could definitely do without that ongoing beeping since my garage, like most garages, has a safety sensor built in. These two areas are the way that they are in the name of safety, as I understand it. These two areas are a small issue that I mostly overlook due to the root function of the device being so good. I would definitely recommend it.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"I just finished installing the My Q wifi garage door opener on the Liftmaster openers (2) at my house.  From start to finish it took less than an hour and everything went extremely well.  Once I downloaded the My Q app, it took me very thoroughly through the installation and connection process.  It took two attempts to connect the hub to my network but the app told me exactly what to do and the second attempt worked perfectly.Both doors are now connected and functioning just as I had hoped.  In addition to the convenience of controlling the doors with my iPhone, I love being able to set push notification alerts when either door opens, when it closes and even if either remains open for a predetermined period of time.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,1
"Overall it works well and I would probably purchase it again. I've run into a few times where the App won't connect to the door. Since that is the main reason for the App, it's a big problem for me. Occasionally I've run into a problem where the door is closed, but the sensor doesn't recognize that and sends me a false alert that the door is open when it's not open. I installed this myself and feel that I have followed the instructions correctly. Customer service has been helpful in resolving the issues when they happen, but the sometimes still occur. After all this, I second guess whether the door is open or closed and will probably by a security camera so I can verify remotely.",3,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"If I can get this working, I'll amend my review but, so far, it has just been a hassle. I didn't have any issues with the initial setup process, but I can't get it to work consistently--I would say that it works 25% of the time, if that. Most of the time I get a message that the garage door is not responding (after about 60 seconds) when trying to open or close the garage door via the MyQ app. I know the hub has a good wi-fi connection--the light is always solid green and I can consistently ping the IP address of the hub from my iPhone which is connected to the same wi-fi network. I am testing from my home--that is my primary use case as the main reason I bought this was so that I wouldn't have to carry the garage door remote with me when riding the motorcycle and could just open the garage via the MyQ app on my phone when returning home. I've emailed their support twice via their web-based form. They say they'll respond in one business day, but it has been way longer than that and I have yet to get a response to either of my emails. I finally called support today and, after a long wait (close to 30 minutes I would say), I finally got a support person on the line. I asked if the flashing light was anything other than a visual warning that the garage door would be closing soon because the instructions said the flashing light must be visible from the garage door opening. This person confirmed that it is just a visible warning. I mentioned that I had read that moving the hub further from the garage door opener than the 4-6 feet stated in the setup instructions might be necessary in some cases due to interference and asked if I should try that. This person said that is the first thing he would try so I moved the hub from the garage ceiling near the opener to an outside wall. It still has a good wi-fi connection, but the door still won't open or close with any level of consistency. I don't know what the deal is. I may try to call their support one more time (seems like that's the only option since my experience is that they don't reply to emails) but, if they don't have any suggestions that seem likely to solve the problems I am having, I will probably just return it. I don't think it is a compatibility issue with my door--it is reportedly compatible and I wouldn't think it would work at all if not. In any case, I like the concept of the product but, at least for me, it has worked very poorly so far--it's not something I could rely on—and their support is inadequate in terms of accessibility. As someone else indicated, it seems their user forum is closed.",1,1,2019-7-30,1,1,0
"I added this to my 15 year old garage door opener.  It works great, one minor flaw. Occasionally the app freezes, and I have to completely stop the app from running, and restart it.  However, it really is a minor flaw, and I do enjoy being able to both control the door from my ohone, but to also see the status of the door.Setup was easy using the app.",3,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"Personally I thought the step by step install instructions via the app was straightforward.  It was a 5 minute set up for me.  It took longer to mount the hub onto the ceiling of my garage (which I later discovered wasn't absolutely necessary).  I love the functionality and ease of use of being able to see my garage door notifications, and being able to control the garage from my phone.  I've noticed that only occasionally, the app will take a little while to load.  Also, i've noticed that a few times when i've tried to use the app as it's switching from my wifi to my cell signal, it will log out and prompt me to log back in.  This has been a rare occurrence and not enough for me to not like the app.  I'm happy overall and would definitely recommend adding it to your non-wifi garage door opener.",4,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
Love this product and would recommend it. If you are purchasing it with the thought of using it as part of a smart home don't. The things it does with smarthings and IFTTT are super simple. Asking it to check door status and close the door are about the only things that are unique to the device. IT WILL NOT OPEN THE DOOR for security protocols. Now install is super simple. I had one operation problem with it not working correctly and as techie I failed trouble shooting 101. Rebooted and all is great. The best part of it is no more remotes and auto close at X time and the app itself.  I have 5 cars to me this is the best part of the product. One last thing you won't  find a workable hack to open the door without app.,5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"Originally paired with an ancient Genie using the MyQ app - worked perfectly.  The Genie died, so bought the Chamberlain B970 and again it paired easily once again with the MyQ app. This is all done on an Android Samsung 8. Then came the agonizing pairing to Alexa.  I scoured numerous web sites and 3/4 of a day of experimentation before I was finally able to get it working.  The key was to install ""SimpleCommands"", set up 2 triggers for the Hub (one to Open and one to Close) as ""Routines"", then get the Alexa app to discover the SimpleCommands Devices (Scenes) which then you have to say; ""Alexa, Start <routine name>"".  Once this is done, I can control the door with the Chamberlain opener with MyQ app, control the Chamberlain Hub with the MyQ app, and control the SimpleCommands (Hub) with the Alexa app (for Amazon Garage Deliveries).The kicker ....  after everything was working, I talked with an Amazon delivery guy and asked him about the Garage Delivery... and his reply (and I quote):  "" Yeah, I've seen the Garage Delivery advertised on TV, but we don't know how to do it"".  Gotta love.  And sorry for anyone that has iOS, I cannot help with that, but I think it's fairly close to what I just said.  There are TONS of people posting about pairing the Hub with Alexa, so just search the web.  Good Luck!!!",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"The product works great and as intended. It advertises Alexa integration but is not available in the amazon skills. This product is great if you want to make your garage door smart.

"On several occasions, I came home and found the garage door open.  Either I didn't close it or it didn't close correctly when I left.  So I needed a way to be notified if the door ever were open.  I tried another product that wouldn't sync with the opener, because at the time this make and model was twice the price, but returned it.  Then this product was discounted to the same price as the non working version, so I got it and it installed like a charm.  I can set alerts on my phone when it opens or has been open for an extended period.  I set email for the major activity like open and close, but added the text message when open for over 15 min or over 30 minutes.  And I can close the door should it be open.  Sure saves the stuff stored in the garage from interested eyes.  Not sure I will use with Amazon deliveries yet, which I could.  I would have to pair it with a camera if I would do that.  Some Amazon drivers don't appear trustworthy.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"I installed this on one door of my two car garage. Installation was relatively straightforward except that the instructions for installing with my Genie garage door opener were not clear. I called Chamberlain customer support and they were able to look up the correct instructions for my specific Genie model. Installation took roughly half an hour, but without that snafu it would’ve been only 15 minutes. As long as you follow the same steps you use to program a new remote for your garage door, set up should go smoothly. Also be aware that once you download the myQ app and begin the installation process, you get more details as to what specific models of your particular garage door opener brand will work with it. You should check online with Chamberlain prior to purchase would be my advice to save yourself some anxious moments scrolling through the precise list in the app during installation.

"I re-purchased the Myq smart garage door opener (chamberlain) after the 1st one died after 2 years.  Warranty is 1 year. Yay (sarcastic). I like the fact that you can control the garage door with this and see if it is open or closed. Plus get alerts of when the garage opens or closes. Be aware the alerts (text alerts) may be delayed. Which defeats the purpose of knowing if your garage is being broken into. Plus, 35% of the time the app won't close the garage doors. I wish they still had the older detectors that you placed on the garage doors that also had the base/s that detect the garage door status. In this case, the old school detectors are better.",3,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"When I bought this I thought it would be more useful.  I have a garage located 3 miles from my house.  More than once I had to drive back to check if I closed the door.  This sounded like the perfect solution.  The reality is since installing it over a month ago I have never used it. I had already trained myself to sit in the driveway and wait until door completely closed before leaving.I do have a couple of hints.  Although my WiFi router supports a 2.4 network,  mine was set up as 5GHz.  MyQ only works on 2.4.  I had to set up a second network.

"I bought two of these during the prime sale for $30 each since I have two doors and each order comes with one door sensor and hub. One door sensor is $30 on its own so now I have a spare hub.I read most of the reviews before ordering and being a techy, I was certain to get it working. One reviewer commented how he ""chuckled"" that it took some users a few hours. But let me explain to you why it can take a few hours. First, the Hub is very picky. You need to have a 2.4ghz network which is fine. My router is pretty powerful and has beam forming to help with signal strength. The hub for the first door took its sweet time (about 30 minutes) to configure. The second door took several hours. There is something about Hub not being able to connect after you push the learn button on your motor. Once I had that configured, the second door for the first day would open and close by itself like it was possessed. It stopped opening and closing by itself and is very convenient to open and close my garage door remotely from the app. Three stars for the easy but painful setup process.

"Works well for my needs. I got this mostly for the notifications because I like to know when people are coming and going and also to get rid of the ""did I leave the garage open!?"" paranoia. It also has a notification you can set up to tell you if it has been left open for X amount of time which comes in handy. Nice not having to lend out keys or trying to hide one as well. It took 4-5 tries/resets to get it to link up and of course my garage was 1000 degrees. So it was a little frustrating, but not too bad. My 1994 Lift-Master opener was right on the cusp of being too old, but it works. Definitely a good, inexpensive upgrade for the peace of mind until I upgrade the opener.

That is all I really wanted this device for.  Would have liked if it had Alexa integration but that is certainly not a deal killer.  The setup was very simple and easy.  Just follow the steps in order.  The instructions do tell you that pairing the hub to the garage door lift could take several tries but my 10 year old Genie and the hub paired the first time.  I picked this up while Amazon had a great deal on it.  Worth every penny and then some to know that I can close my garage door from anywhere.  It does take 30 seconds or so to engage once you tell the door to open/close.  One reviewer said to assign a static IP which I may doUpdate:  This does integrate with Alexa via a third party app called SimpleCommands.

My router is quite far from my garage and so far I have no had any issue using the open/close functionality. The application is ""dumb"", which is actually a good thing. Remember, this is only a garage door opener, people! The app is basically a blank screen with a circular button to open and close your door. That's it. Reliability is critical and so far the door responds within 1-2 seconds of me pressing the button in the app, which is again impressive given the likely latency.I would recommend this as a low cost upgrade for most people.",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
"After much trial and error, I finally figured out how to get rid of the default beeping when your garage door closes! First off want to say this device works as expected, easy to install (with the app on your phone), easy to pair each transmitter to the base for multiple garage doors! Quick install, not much to it. I don’t know why people all complain about the connection. Works great, integrates with amazon and their delivery, and easy to open and close from my phone wherever I’m at.Now, how to get rid of the beeping when the garage door closes. So you’ll need to open up the hub box and locate the sound device, which is the only piece of plastic with a hole in it. What I did was take needle nose pliers and from the inside of the hole to the out, bend the hole open wide. I took a small screw driver and scratched and poked the inside copper of the sound device (I’m no electrician so I’m using Laymans terms). The scratching seemed to do the trick, but what I also did was stuff the device with duct tape (figured rubber would be safe) and then put more tape on top and covered the hole and the sound holes of the main device. The scratching of the copper seemed to do the trick cuz I don’t hear the slightest faint of noise. The stuffing is probably over kill, but I attached photos so you can see clearly what I did. The blinking light still works (which I still don’t mind as being the only warning it offers). Put it back together and boom, works perfect and won’t wake my kids up if I use the app while they’re napping! Hope you enjoy!",5,1,2020-1-8,1,1,1
"I am an IT guy but I must confess — for years I’ve thought I needed to replace my garage door opener in order to gain “smart” control. This product not only works with my existing opener, it works REALLY WELL. The ability to operate the door from quite literally anywhere provides some powerful benefits. For example, if a customers need to drop off a computer for service and I’m not home, I no longer have to tell them to leave it on the front porch — they can call or message me and, within seconds, I can open the garage door and close it when they leave.Installation is very easy.

"So far this is a great product. The setup is fairly rough which is why I’m giving it a 4 star. I’m a software programmer and it feels like maybe the setup is a bit buggy. Essentially WiFi and Bluetooth really need to be solid during setup. If not you basically have to figure out how to reset everything to factory default, then move to a different location to see if you get better signals. I finally got it after three resets. Now the second device for my second garage door went in perfectly. Maybe I had practice. Once these were in and no longer required Bluetooth which is just needed during setup they have been smooth as butter. That’s why they get the 4 stars., my point is, if you fail at setup, move it around and try again. If you can get through it, these are amazing.",4,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Mostly worthless as an opener or closer of garage. When activated thru the myQ app, Randomly decides to either open the door or will close the door but cannot do both in succession. Any thoughts of using for the Amazon key application is a recipe for disaster. Not hard to setup although instructions for pairing the sensor to the hub are not really clear, just stumbled into getting synced. Supposedly it paired with my genie door opener and raised the garage door. Even closed it once thru the app before function ceased. Re-paired with genie but no different on function.

"I own two great Chamberlain LiftMaster products. A $3000 automatic gate and a $400 garage opener. Both are awesome. However, when it comes to building software solutions, Chamberlain is terrible at it! I bought this Hub first, after spending 2 hours trying to make it work and troubleshooting with a very condescending young tech support rep. (I own a Silicon Valley tech company, I am tech savvy) I decided to just buy a new Garage Opener all-together that came with their wifi capability built-in. Then I bought the $100 Bridge in order to enable my brand new wifi enabled garage opener to integrate with Apple Homekit but it did not allow me to install. Their software had server time-outs on the app etc.  After 60 minutes, this time I knew enough to make the right decision, not waste more time and return it. All of their boxes (hubs/bridges/gateways) are poorly made toys, i rather not be able to use Siri to open my garage door than having to call their support line again to speak to a teenager without proper training in customer support. They must outsource their software to subpar developer shops.",1,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
"MyQ hub garage door opener. Well it took about an hour to get myq to pair with our Craftsman . Secondly  it will only work on the initial phone that set up myq, it will not work on my phone, if I try to open or close garage or says error 000. So this is a horrible pain in the ass system to get going. So much so that it will be sent back immediately and I'll look for the next best thing.  Update days later.. still won't connect to my phone. Frustrating",2,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0

"This was an absolute game changer!!  It is probably my favorite purchase of last year!  My son seems to forget to let me know when he gets home from school.  I also had some late nights at work when I would come home at 8:30 and the garage door was still open. I would also get a text from the neighbors some nights at 10 pm letting me know that my garage door was still open if we forgot to close it.  It was sooo frustrating!  I bought this and it has made my life so much easier!  It was so easy to install.  Basically you hook it to your Wi-fi and stick the other sensor to the garage door.  It instructs you to mount the other part to the ceiling but it is not necessary.  When you close it from the app it flashes a bright strobe and beeps very loudly.  It is not a sensor of any kind, just a warning and only if closed from the app.  I have it sitting on the shelf in my garage and it works just fine.  I get a notification on my phone every time the door opens and closes and I can open and close it remotely from anywhere via the app.  I bought 3 as Christmas presents.  No more turning around to check and see if you closed the garage door.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"Be advised: trying to find printed installation instructions will take more time than just downloading the app and following the instructions contained therein, so don't waste your time. The actual installation took about 10 minutes, because I'm a scofflaw who did not mount the internet hub to the ceiling as required by the instructions (the Wifi in my detached garage is weak, so I chose to keep it as close to the hub as possible). Not mounting the hub will not affect the performance of the device.Once installed, the MyQ works exactly as you'd expect it to, telling you at a glance if the door is open or closed and for how long, alerting you if the door is opened without the app (you will get an alert when using your existing remotes), and allows you to operate the door from anywhere. I have not used any of the other features yet.",5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"This works great with two different garage opener brands that I have. Once installed, it has worked amazingly. The only trouble I had is during set up. It wouldn't register the QR code on either one that I got. I followed the steps and couldn't get it to go through. I contacted Customer Service and they were AMAZING! The woman I spoke with was friendly, detailed and explained every step with me. She didn't just help with the first one and leave me to it, she took the time to go through both setups with me to make sure they were working and in order. Rare to have people take this much time to ensure that you are satisfied with their product.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I selected the Chamberlain MyQ product based on reviews and specifications. My exterior garage door opener keypad decided to give up on me and the replacement keypad was the same price as this product. What a pleasant surprise. The product arrived promptly and after unpacking the box I followed the enclosed instruction booklet. Now I am a bit of a techno-geek, so nothing was foreign or new to me. I spent less than 10 minutes for the entire install and test. The instructions were real easy to follow and paired to the door sensor, my network and my mobile phone in under a minute.  The only area I see for improvement (I have an android phone, my wife (of course) has an i-Phone, so the ""add a user"" required her to re-install and pair the gateway all over again. The system works flawlessly from a local logon to my wireless network and also via the mobile phone network literally world wide (as long as you have a data connection). My existing interior door opener button and door opener remotes operate as normal. I have used the product for two weeks and used it multiple times a day. Great product. I strongly recommend this product for ease of install, value for money and no monthly fees :-)",5,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0
"This hub and the apps for my iPhone and my wife’s Android phone solved our problems with Chamberlain garage door remote controls. I could never figure out why the range for our remotes and the keypad got worse over time. I tried fiddling with the antenna, changing batteries, even changed the location of WiFi router thinking it might be interfering with the signal. Began to suspect the controller board was failing. Replacement for the board would be about $70. That was the same cost as the smart hub. Why not give it a try? Install was straightforward and worked right away. I would have given 5 stars but for a little quirk in my app. If the door stays open for a long time I sometimes get an error message that the door position sensor is not linked. This error clears easily (just close the door using hard-wired control) but you have to clear it before the app can operate the door.",4,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
This product would be a great idea if it worked.  I have networking experience.  I usually have no problems with network wireless devices.  Hub is only 10 feet away from my router. Signal super strong.  Sometimes li loses my left door.  Sometimes it loses my right door.  I have to go through the setup process time and time again. Will work great for a day or two.  Several times I have been unable to log into Chamberlains website to run the app. Very frustrating.  No tech support whatsoever.,1,1,2018-6-26,1,3,0
"I wanted this just in case our garage door opener in the car did not work ... batteries or someone pressing and holding the wrong buttons too long. This was easy to set up, the instructions were very clear, without having to be too handy or techy. No problems at all! Very happy with this device.Found out that every time I set this up it would bump out 1 of my cars from working with Homeline. I reached out to customer support and never got a response. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 2 star b/c of that (generously). I went with MEROSS instead b/c its hard wired to trigger the actual garage door open/close button and is not set up as another transmitter to the garage door. My problem maybe b/c of my genie garage door so I can't say for sure, but its annoying to reprogram the car and find that bumps the MyQ or vice-versa!",2,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"I do not use alexa at all, I value my privacy to an extent. It was very easy to setup and install, the only concern I have is I tried opening the door from my phone one day while at work because my son forgot his key and it did not work.

"Ignore the bad reviews. In fact, consult Fakespot regarding the many fraudulent bad reviews. This product does what it says and does exactly what I purchased it for. No more no less. I got it on sale for $40 - an absolute steal. The components are smaller than I thought they would be. (A good thing). The installation was quick and easy. (I have a Linear brand chain drive opener)Simply put, I absolutely love this product. The Android app is simple and seamless making installation dummy proof. Again, these other reviews are bizarre to me (maybe they are old or in reference to another product). It didn't really matter where I mounted the hub. As long as it picks up your wifi signal and is within Bluetooth distance to the module on the garage door.

"Set up and installation were both easy.  The set up video is the most well done, clearest presentations that I have ever seen for a product.  I took some liberty with placing the door sensor as my door has foam insulation.  Instead of the door corner, I placed the sensor on a vertical rail about 3 feet in from the door edge.I was most worried about the device not working due to the very low router wifi signa in my garagel.  Using an app, my signal dropped to below 50 mbs in the garage.  In spite of this, the product works well although it would save a bit of worry if the manufacturer was able to state the minimum mbs required by the hub.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"Updated review - March 2, 2020After 7 months of using this device, I am ready to replace it.  Initially, I was happy with the product but since then, I have had problems every couple of months.  After 3 months of operation, my MYQ-G0301 started to go offline. I had to re-do the setup a couple of times because the unit would refuse to reconnect to the wifi router.  I contacted support and they asked me to replace the battery in my sensor, even though the battery was not low.  I replaced the battery but continued to have the same issue.  Then the support person said my firmware was old and should be updated, even though the unit was supposed to update the firmware automatically.  After forcing a manual firmware update, the unit seemed to work better for a few weeks.",2,1,2019-8-5,1,0,1

"This is a great accessory that brings my 20 year old garage door opener into the 20th century.  It was very easy to install on my 1999 era LiftMaster garage door opener and works very well.  We frequently have family, neighbors and contractors that need access to our garage and now I have an easy way to give them access while I am not  at home.  I used to try to do the same with my external keypad, but I would inevitably make a mistake programming the time or the code and have to spend 15 minutes on the phone only to find out the garage door wouldn’t open.  Now I can control it from my phone and I can also control when the door closes too.  Great product and a very good value.  Would definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"I installed one sensor on each garage door, as I did not want to use my in-vehicle garage door feature, zince I park in the driveway.  Now I just use my iPhone.I would give it 5 stars but it's a tad buggy.  I set up a Siri shortcut so I can use voice commands.  The shortcut works great to open the door, but about 25% of the time, when I tell Siri to close the garage, it says it cannot connect to the MyQ.  So I usually go straight to the app and it works 99% of the time.  Occasionally, I have to wait a bit for the garage to respond.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0

This one went in quick, you add it as an additional garage remote, attach it to your WiFi network (yes WiFi Only) and it works like a charm. You can see the status of the door, and control it through the app. You can also configure alerts (push, or email) for the door, and it has integrations in app for things like nest cams etc.",5,1,2018-3-23,1,2,0

The video show the mount on the ceiling and WRAPPING excess power cord around the mounting base (remember this step).  So the unit is mounted, paired and do not work. I attempted numerous FAQ fixes over the course of hours. Finally, I got thru to a customer service rep. After numerous attempts to fix the issue “we” moved the unit back to the original outlet. Eureka! It worked. I followed the video installation of placement 4 feet from the opener unit. The service rep stated no. 6-8 feet.

This needs to be added into the Alexa Skills area so it can work with Alexa. Thats WHY I bought this.

I purchased 2 of these kits.  Installed on 2 different overhead doors.  I have Chamberlain door operators.  This product takes a little time/effort to install/setup but once completed it works very well.  You can always check status of doors (open or closed) but it also tells you how long they’ve been open or closed. You can set text/email alerts for when doors are opened or closed and repeat alert if desired.  Connection to WiFi and pairing needs were all painless - only took a few seconds.

"This was a christmas present for myself as I wanted to expand my smart home features to the garage. Unlike others who have reviewed this product, I had zero problems with the installation. It took about 45 minutes start to finish, most of that spent mounting the hub in an appropriate spot. My installation was for two doors. It was impossible to mount the hub on the ceiling within the recommended 4-6' from each opener as there was no ceiling outlet at that point (and the cord on the wall transformer was too short), so I mounted it on the wall, where I could get an equal distance of about 7' to each opener. My Genie openers paired up exactly as they were supposed to and the app worked great to open/close and provide notifications about door events. I've also had one Amazon Key delivery successfully done. My only complaint: there is no official integration with Alexa. I would really like to see that feature. I've only had the setup working for two weeks, so I'm going to be watching for some of the signs / symptoms reported by others, but as I said, so far, so good!",4,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

"When my 10-year-old garage door opener remote finally died on me, I thought that I was going to have to go through all kinds of hoops to try to find a replacement. This solution worked great to not only replace my dead remote control, but it allowed me to wirelessly control the door with my phone, which I have been wanting to do for a while now.  I was really surprised by how quickly this was able to be installed. It only took a few minutes for me to get everything set up and create my account.  Within about five minutes everything was set up and working just as advertised. The only confusion to this system that I saw is that when you share your account access with a friend or family member, it is not readily apparent within their app. The other person must install the app and create a profile for themselves.  You use your app to send your friend or family member an invitation, that they must accept.  This invite goes into a separate tab on their app that has your devices listed.  They must select the tab for your devices in order to use your opener.  Nothing a few minutes of head scratching wouldn’t reveal to you..  Anyhow- it was well worth the price and allowed me to replace my broken remote for only about $7 more than I planned to spend for it, alone.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I had some minor difficulties installing and it turns out it was too close.  Once I called customer service and moved it further away from the opener, it was fine.That said, the integration with google assistant is horrid.  You have to ask google to connect to myq and then you’re stuck talking to a dumb myq assistant instead of google.  I have 2 doors installed and there appears to be no way to ask for the status of both doors at once or do anything with both doors at once.  For single operations you need to specify the door name exactly and say exact commands.  The assistant is quite dumb and it’s very frustrating.  There is also no way to integrate these doors into other smart home features because of this extra hop.  They desperately need to focus on UX and just integrate directly with the google assistant instead of trying to create their own.",3,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

The issue is the MyQ integration into Google Assistant is spotty at best. I can ask Google to close the garage with no problem, however when I ask Google to open the garage or placing a routine to open the garage such as I'm home it only ever tells me the status of the garage.

"The installation went smoothly for both of my garage door openers-one hub and two door sensors. But for some reason there was some type of cross talk between them because when I tried to remotely open and close door A, it would actually open and close door B.  I called Chamberlain and we spent an hour and a half trying to figure out why.  The agent needed to ask a higher level expert for advise because this one stumped the agent (who was determined to solve whatever was causing this-thus staying with me the whole time).  It turned out to solve the problem I had to reset both door openers to unlink their “learning,” then whenever I tried to “learn” one door I had to physically unplug the other door opener, and vise versa.  This worked, and the associate stayed with me on the phone step by step until I had the phone app working and the home links in each car working without any crosstalk.The free app is all I need.  It sends me a alert after the door remains open for a custom set amount of time (I use 10 minutes), and I have it set to check if any door is open at 6pm, 9 pm and midnight, and if open to automatically close.  This way I know neither door will ever stay open all night no matter what time anyone get home and forgets to manually close the door.",5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0

"This device is very easy to install and setup via internet, now I can control the main access to the house, because sometimes you're not very sure if you closed or not the door.I my case I have a different setup for the door opener (I have 2 gates, they open form their side) I have an extra steps to make the sensor detect the correct position open (horizontal position for the sensor) and close (vertical position) but its working pretty good!",5,1,2018-9-12,1,2,1
While our house has about every home automation item available this was not necessarily bought for that reason. We only had two door openers from when we bought the house but have three vehicles. Generally my wife kept her remote control in her purse but this caused the button to be hit and the door be left open or inadvertently opened.Insert the MyQ smart garage door opener. Install took roughly 15 minutes and set up using the app was seamless.  Apart from being able to control the door through the app if set up you can get notifications if the door is left open for a certain amount of time. This allowed us to be alert if the door was left open before heading to bed. It’s also come in handy when letting friends and family into the house. So far it’s work flawlessly.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"Unfortunately this product didn't work for me. It says it's compatible with most garage door openers. It even says it's compatible with Wayne Dalton Classic Drive. Unfortunately if you dig deeper, it's only compatible with a specific frequency model of Classic Drive. Unfortunately I have the 303Mhz version which is not compatible.That being said, the rest of the setup was straight forward and easy. The app stepped you right through the process and had both video and written instructions right in the app to guide you through the process. It quickly found my network and connected. It wasn't until the remote programming portion of the process that I discovered it won't connect to my remote.",3,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
"So the prior owners of my house have a Chamberlain opener for the double garage, and even had the ethernet bridge for that opener.  But my single garage opener is clearly original to the house from the mid-90s and is a Liftmaster.  Every once in a while the single grage doesn't close when I drive away, and I wanted a way to make the old opener compatible with the Chamberlain app.  This device will do that.Installation itself isn't bad.  You stick the sensor on the inside of the top panel of the garage door and pair it with the app.  The hub/controller is easy to plug in, but getting it to pair to my Liftmaster garage door opener was nearly impossible.  I cleared all prior codes to my opener (which disconnected all of my remotes/cars).  Somehow it got connected, but it was a hassle of me standing on the ladder for about an hour.  I can probably blame the extreme age of the opener.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"It is fairly easy to setup and install.Waste of money....opener continually indicates closing on app when door is opening...also annoying beeping everytime it operates (I understand safety measures, but my regular garage door opener does not beep at all, it makes enough noise to make anyone close aware...and isn't that why there is a safety to auto open when it comes in contact with something...), without the ability to turn off beeping, pay to add to Google home, come on.... The Total disappointment, because I did not get around to installing until after I missed my return window. Will try a garage wifi adapter, seems to be simpler. I have a Craftsman/Chamberlain garage door opener, how come they did not make a simple wifi adapter. The system does seem a little overkill for what it does.

I was surprised to hear it, but back in the box and off to Amazon Returns for this item.If you're not interested in Amazon Echo, this might be a good choice for you.

It works about 20% of the time, which defeats the whole purpose.

I had one more idea before reaching out to Customer Support--move the main unit. I had a hunch that locating it within a foot of a screw-in LED lightbulb on my garage ceiling might be interfering with it in some way, even though it got plenty of Wi-Fi signal and the green light glowed steadily. I moved the control unit about TWO feet away from the LED bulb, and all has been well, since. SO, friends, don't mount the control unit too close to an LED bulb, as I guess their built-in transformers must throw more RF than I would have thought.

"My wife doesn’t want to let Amazon delivery guys in our garage, so I paid full price for this. It worked well with my 20+ year old Craftsman garage door opener. The app itself isn’t great and is bloated with ads for other services it kinda works with. Surprisingly, since this is meant to work with Amazon delivery guys, one of those services is not Alexa. For a while, I thought I could operate it with my Apple Watch.  Unfortunately, the Watch app is so buggy it only works 10% of the time. 90% of the time, I get a spinning wheel on my watch and need to pull out my phone to use it. Fortunately, there’s a free Amazon Skill called Simple Command that will get it to work as a routine and you can customize a Alexa voice routine so “Alexa, open garage” and “Alexa, close garage” are all you have to say. It takes probably 15 minutes of reading to set it up with your voice on Alexa. Installation instructions of the hardware itself were very straightforward and easy to follow. Since my Tesla doesn’t come with Home Link, I’m using Alexa as my opener. With my phone on the charging pad, I say “Hey Siri, launch Alexa” then “Alexa, open garage”. Takes about 6 seconds. Not as easy as a button but it works for me!",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"First I'll say that I don't use Alexa but I'm sure it works great with it.  It was easy to install and set up.  I did have to add a receptacle because the existing duplex was being used by the garage door motor and the ac adapter for the door sensors but once I did that it was as easy as following directions.  It works great for In garage deliveries.  I paired both my phone and my girlfriend's phone to it so we both know when the door is open or closed and can control the door remotely.  Once I add a camera then it will really be perfect.  Oh ya I read a review before I bought it about lights interfering with it, but my garage is pretty d*** bright, and I have no problems.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,1

So far, I have not been able to purchase anything that utilized the Key feature, but I am completely ready. The install of the device was easy, but I did have to call customer service (now that was a different experience and not a happy one) to help me get it synced to my garage door opener. Once they told me what I was ""doing wrong"", I was able to get the garage to connect. Now I'm just waiting for my 1st Amazon Key order so that I can justify the cost of ownership.

I was able to locate a free coupon code online. And even then I have to say ""Ok Google. Talk to MyQ"" then you have to listen to a list of prompts on what to say every time and is really time consuming.

"This device pairs seamlessly with the door sensor.  It is a breeze to get it on wifi.  It tells you if your door is open or closed.  Unfortunately, it does not pair with the door itself.

With my AccessMaster garage door opener, I've paired new remotes and cloned them to cars.  It's really not hard to do.  Sadly, the Chamberlain MyQ is not up to the task of pairing with the Chamberlain AccessMaster garage door opener.  I am returning the one I bought.  I do not recommend wasting your money on this.

"tl;dr: best feature is being able to have other people use it on their devices and check the status of the garage door, which a lot of other devices will do and not charge you a subscription fee to be able to tell your phone assistant to do the same things you do in the app. The best I can do is review it and hopefully detour someone who didn't put a lot of research into it from getting something that isn't right for them.***EDIT: subscription is only $1 a month or $10 a year, which I find acceptable even though I would rather it be free.

I reset the password once twenty minutes ago, but then for some reason, while I was waiting for the opener thingy to pair with my phone, it decided to time itself out and stop the app. So I had to sign in again, but apparently the password I'd gotten from them didn't last even twenty minutes. Then, when I tried to resend a new password, it says there was 'an error connecting to the server"".... um, WHY? I'm ready to throw something. This is very poor engineering.

Fortunately the app worked to reopen the door, and after a little Googling I found a video on how to program Linear garage door remotes - super easy.

Also provides an extra security to look up on the app to ensure the garage door is closed. App is easy to use so that you can also control your garage door access remotely.

Don’t worry about that garage door being left open.  This lets you know via the app and notifications or emails if garage door has been opened or closed - and ability to open or close it via smart phone application even while away from home.It was an easy install & set up for this senior citizen.  Probably 1/2 hour which included digging the ladder out of the corner of the garage so I could reach the ceiling electric outlet.  Only issue I encountered - set up will ask for the color of the LEARN button on the garage door opener - my button is definitely Orange or maybe faded Red - but setup wouldn’t complete until I tried Purple and then it worked.  So if at first you don’t succeed - try another button color would be my suggestion.,5,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0
"I didn’t care for the sticker only mounting option for the sensor. If you have insulated garage panels it doesn’t stick so I had to move it to a place other than recommended to the far right metal frame of the door after it fell of twice. Also, it took several long tries and repeat msgs of “sorry your garage motor doesn’t seem to support...” before it finally paired and started working w my Genie garage opener.After about a week, it completely lost the device connection when I needed it most to let in my Aunt while I was out of town. Attempt to restore have been futile. I don’t recommend this device.

"I put too much trust in this thing and didn't take my garage remote with me on my motorcycle trip.  When I got back from my trip, I was greeted with the device ""offline"" message indicating that it could not connect to the internet as if the internet was down at my house.  Well that's just not the case as i confirmed I could connect just fine on my phone through our WiFi.  I eventually got inside my house, reset the hub and it connected.  ""We were back in business"", it had to be a fluke; I thought to myself.  Nope, this pile of dookie would continue to fall off the face of Earth on a daily basis to this day.  I've followed solutions to this problem, I even put a range extender in my garage to ensure I have a strong connection, nothing is addressing the issue  I will likely return this Cleveland steamer shortly as it's pretty worthless.

"Best $30 I spent recently. This is a must have at this price. Install took maybe 10 minutes. Simple plug in power, press a couple buttons, let in do its thing, mount it and your ready to roll. Having the peace of mind of knowing if and when your garage door is open or closed is worth it’s price alone. Being able to control it anywhere anytime is a bonus. Timing from notifications and function between app and garage is almost instant. Not a big enough lag to complaint about. This is a must buy.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,1,0

This worked ok at first then it just stopped sensing whether the door sensor was vertical or horizontal. Replacing the battery didn't work and it would beep every time the sync button was pushed so it was a bad sensor. The app still opened and closed the door and I had a camera so it wasn't that bad until that app decided it knew better than me and refused to send a signal again. This left my garage door open for about 2 hours before I could drive home to close it.The issue is trying to contact the company was impossible so this was basically a waste of money for about 2 months of use.,1,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I had a hub with a single sensor (i.e. a single door) and it worked great. Added a 2nd sensor - installation was smooth but then reliability went down. If you open the two doors at the same time, the device many times doesn't catch that at all and will just tell you the doors are still closed. It also sometimes just misses a door opened or closed. I called the helpdesk and they made me reset the entire system - hub and 2 sensors - which seems like it worked for a short time but now it's back to being unreliable. The good side of this is that I can still open and close both door remotely so that's one feature that works, but I can't trust the alerts anymore.",3,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"Be aware of limitations of this product when using Amazon Key. I purchased the Hub to take advantage of the KEY access for Amazon deliveries. Worked great. However, to have a KEY account, you have to be the primary user of the MyQ Hub. My spouse would also like to use Key but can't as we is not the primary account holder for the MyQ Hub, and she can NOT be given any kind of primary access, just guest access. So I thought I would install a second Hub and make her he primary user on it and thus be able to have KEY deliveries when she ordered item on her Amazon account. Unfortunately, there are issues with the second hub recognizing when the door is closed and Contacting the vendor reveals you can not have two hubs connected to the same opener. So if you want two different amazon account to be able to have KEY access, it can not be done using the MyQ Hub. You have been warned. :)",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"It's inexpensive, so there's that. Setup was kind of painful. Not very responsive when controlling through the app. Sometimes it doesn't respond. Worst part is there are no integrations with Alexa. I can be in my living room and turn off all of my lights,  lock my doors, and even have Alexa hum me to sleep, but I can't have her check if my garage door is shut. This means I have to go check which pretty much renders all if the other automation moot.From what I can tell, Chamberlain laughingly thinks they are able to monetize their API to be used outside of their application.

So when I installed this into my detached garage, it hit or missed on if the WiFi signal was strong enough to communicate with it. I've since upgraded my router and I have a constant connection to the device and I love it.I have remotes for my door opener so that wasn't really the selling point here, even though you can open and close it with your phone....the selling point to me is that when you rush out of your house for work in the am and can't remember if you closed the garage, this guy does the trick.

"I had high hopes for the myQ, and I initially had no trouble installing the product and getting it to work.  But, not long after installing it the sensor disconnected from the base.  I was able to quickly reset everything and get it working.  However, it will not stay connected.  Every few days it disconnects on its own.  It's very frustrating to need to open the garage remotely and the myQ doesn't work.  Also, resetting the myQ is a time consuming process.  Once or twice is ok, but when you have to do it continuously it becomes annoying real fast.

Get to know your “learn” button, will need it.  Chamberlain does a great job explaining on app.  Recommend watching YouTube videos and then going thru app makes install a snap.  I’d also recommend getting two hubs for two doors versus extra sensor.  Price isn’t too much more and easier to install.Now the bad news....Genie is supposed to be compatible.  After hours trying to make it work at our home, called Amazon support who connected me with Chamberlain support.  Rep was great, but never got it working after an hour.

One issue the limit on the number of users. There are 4 of us in the family so in order to give our neighbor access, we had to remove one of us.Also, I highly recommend using a stronger tape than what comes with it.

I downloaded the app and installed the MyQ and it worked for about 2 weeks then I had to reprogram everything again. (BTW the watch app only works about 20% of the time). It worked intermittently for another 3 weeks then gave me error codes and wanted me to reprogram again. I replaced the battery in the door sensor just  on GP’s, reprogramed and it is working again...so far about 2 hrs.To anyone using this app and/or system leave the hub somewhere you can get to it without a ladder because it makes it easier to re-program every 2 to 3 weeks.",2,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0

Now I can't even get it to connect at all.When connected I can use it from anywhere and it tells me if the door is open, or closed, and how long, but it keeps disconnecting.

I have been wanting to purchase a smart garage door device for a while but nothing decent a while. I was hoping nest would put something out but they haven’t as of yet.

I opened and closed the door a couple of times to make sure the first door was working before proceeding to the second garage door.  On my third attempt to open the garage door, I heard a loud pop and noticed smoke coming from the motor.  I immediately unplugged the unit and removed the back cover.  Something that looks like a large capacitor literally exploded inside the garage door motor housing.  My Genie Garage door opener worked perfectly.  I installed the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain MYQ-G0301 and now I have to buy an entire new garage door opener.  As expected, customer support was a joke.

"Easy installation, it connected to my WiFi with ease, even though it's a good 40 yards away from my router.  The phone app. is excellent, it allows you to open and close your garage door.

(Amazon was also promoting it with a $10 credit after your 1st Key delivery and $19.99 on Ciber Monday)  The app notifies you when the door is opened or closed.  A camera can be installed to have a visual of the delivery.  The phone app. is also a good back-up if have a rental car and or you don't have a remote to open or close the garage door.

I love that it the MyQ sends out warnings when you garage door is opened for too long and you are able to open and close your garage door remotely. I do dislike that the MyQ hub beeps and has flashing lights when you use the app to close the garage door. It’s annoying if you are at home and hear it, but I understand that its to prevent the garage door from closing on a person. However, most garage door comes with a laser sensor to prevent this exact event. Another thing that bugged me is that you have to pay a subscription fee if you wanted added functionality like connecting to IFTTT.

Just install and download the app! So simple and so convenient I can’t believe I didn’t know this existed sooner! Especially when you have family/friends visiting and they need access through the garage, no more deciding who will be home first so someone can open the door for the other because you only have 2 remotes. Everyone can have access by simply downloading the app and signing them into your system while they are visiting. Also the added bonus of having amazon deliveries put in your garage rather than leaving them on the porch is such a nice feature. I never want to go back!!!",5,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
I think it really sucks that it requires an additional hub to integrate with Alexa. And that hub cost five times what this product does. It’s lousy if not criminal of them to advertise Alexa integration when it’s not included with the current product. Also really hate the annoying loud sound it makes when preparing to close. Scares the stuffing out of my dog. Should be an option to turn that off. I consider this product a major fail by a well established company.On the plus side the install was easy but make sure you check the length of the cord since they tell you to put it as far from the plug as the cord is long. An extra half inch and you’ll have to remount it.,1,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"This product has the potential to be great. It will work just fine for anybody who has a newer garage door opener. And, yes, I realize that is stated clearly in the specs and description. I was hopeful...  They missed a great opportunity to make their product truly universally applicable!! A simple set of contacts on the outside of the device would have made it so that anybody could connect it to nearly any garage door opener that has a wired push button. This is lacking on the MyQ, so for me, the opening/closing function simply does not work at all, unless I completely change out/upgrade my opener. I can use MyQ for monitoring the state of the door. That's it. An unfortunate design flaw and missed opportunity!",2,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0

Super easy installation. Literally once you download the app and follow the directions to sign up. There is a step by step instructional video of a real person installing the kit. It took me less than 5 minutes to install it. My only dislike is the beeping noise it makes when the garage door is closing.

But this isn't always the case. It loses connection to the wifi occasionally. I have many other smart devices near, and further than the myq that never lose connection. Even smart bulbs outside of the same garage that this is installed. The real problem is the delay in notifications.

For the Chamberlain you only need to hook it up to a power source, and it can be anywhere in the ceiling.  Heck you can just mount it anywhere in the garage and it would work.Without the app the product itself is pretty useless.  I'm glad to find that the current version is stable and has great reviews at the IOS app store.  The most important aspect for me is the scheduler and reminder functions and both works great.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

It works flawlessly although I wish that I could set it to only alert me to a door change between certain hours. I don't care if it opens at 5pm when someone comes home, but I would like to know why it opens at 1pm when nobody is home.Also I was unable to get it working with Alexa via ITTT.

Now I have it sitting on a shelf, and there have been no issues since then. Maybe the metal tracks and supports of the door were getting in the way of the signal. Whatever.

The alerts are priceless if you have people who constantly forget to close your garage door (teenagers). I know exactly when my door was opened and closed. It is the best. I literally closed my garage door when I was out of the country and was alerted that it had been opened too long (the alert time I set for 1 hour). Buy this. You will not be disappointed.

What I will say is that although the instructions walk you through set up very well, if you aren’t aware you need to install the app to receive those instructions that isn’t helpful. I think that no instructions contained in the box should be clearly stated since not everyone wants to use their phone for this (my husband’s car has the remote in the visor, so he will not install the app).",4,1,2019-8-2,1,1,0

You can't place the hub within 4 feet of anything metal, so all the fluorescent light fixtures on my garage ceiling caused me to spend some time finding a good place for the hub where the door would both open and close remotely.Several of the reviews I read said it is Apple Homekit compatible. It is not, unless you buy a special bridge in addition to this kit. I wasted a lot of time trying to get it into Homekit.

Interesting thing is that the myQ app “reverse integrates” with HomeKit, i.e. it can connect to any HomeKit hubs on my WiFi Network and introspect rooms and associated light switches, bulbs, etc. Maybe a forthcoming app update will allow end to end HomeKit integration.

The first time around I had no luck, was actually ready to send it back. Support saw my tweets and reached out to me. Fortunately this morning I tried again and things worked as plan.As others have mentioned I think the radio system is quite weak and the app warns you that you need a good signal for the hub and that is quite true. I put an extender in the garage to boost wifi and it made a big difference in the install as well as the responsiveness.

Also, there is a very loud annoying safety chirping that goes on and on (~30 seconds before, during, and after) when closing the garage.  My garage already has all the safety features incorporated but I guess Chamberlain thinks they can force me to provide personal information and tell me how to run my house.

Came back resetup the system again and it works.  I did not fit MyQ on the ceiling and it doesn't have to. I just left in near the wall socket and fitted the LED light bulb back and they work flawlessly. I have no intent to integrate with IFTTT or any of the voice assistance.

Installation was quite easy following the app instructions and a youtube video for backup.  I was concerned that perhaps my wifi would not reach the garage and although the signal isn't super strong, it was good enough for the device to work.  My only minor disappointment is the time it takes for the device to push the notification to my phone that the door has opened.  It can take longer than I like to get the notification but it will come eventually and it's not a deal breaker.  So far, I would recommend the product.

Since then I've added Harmony Hub, Smart Things, and Simple Commands to control things like my dual zone stereo, TV, Blink Cameras, and now garage door.Installation is really straight forward.  It took me about 20 minutes in all.  Just follow the step by step instructions.  Once you get it installed do a search for how to set myq up with Alexa.  While not super intuitive, you can tell Alexa to open or close your garage.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"After reading all the reviews I decided to try for myself and also install one in my neighbors garage and they work flawless, My 73 year old neighbor installed and programmed it by following the simple directions. Always works on with his or his wife's phones, all the talk about distance and frequency means nothing to the average person, you don't need controls in your cars or remembering to bring  one with you when you go out with someone else. No more standing in the rain or bad weather putting your code in a keypad. My experience has been great the the opener add on, but unlike some of the others reviewers I have not tried it from the moon",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
Bought this for my garage as I have people who forget to close the garage...including me. I can just look at my phone for piece of mind.  Install was a breeze....decent wireless coverage in your garage is the key.I have it set up for various times of the day to look for a closed garage....it will shut it if its open at that particular time. It has more capabilities that I have yet to use.,5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"This is a great product, but it requires some patience to set it all up. The app tries to make it easy, but I had to start over a few times. I was able to get the hub onto my wifi, then link it to the sensor, but the show-stopper was that it just wouldn't sync up with the garage door opener itself. As a test I set up a remote in my car, and it went smoothly. I came to the realization that it's a problem with the MyQ App on my phone - it didn't seem to make the hub send the signals out once I'd pressed the learn button on the opener.The solution was simple - using a laptop I logged into the MyQ website, created an account, and manually added the Hub to my account (there's a serial number on the install guide). Once I did that, I was able to tell the hub to sync up with the garage door opener from the website, instead of with the app, and it worked on the first try! You'd think the app and the website would tell the hub the same thing, but apparently not. Hopefully this saves someone else some time.",4,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
"it works but you'll either need to do some finagling or purchase additional components if you want to use your voice to control your garage door via siri.  it frequently tells me the garage door is open yet my security system says it's closed.  every time it says it's open, i go down to the garage to see it's closed.  nice to be able to open the garage door from my apple watch though after coming back from walking the dog.",2,1,2019-4-2,1,2,0
"I bought this because 1. my garage door opener likes to open, but not close the door and 2. we always forget if we closed the garage or not. Out of the box setup was easy, took 5 mins or so after watching a YouTube video. I was able to add my wife as a guest on the app, so she has access to it. It has options to send you alerts if it’s open/closed for a select period of time, schedule it to open/close at a certain time, and shows you when it was last opened/closed. My favorite thing is being able to open and close it from anywhere! When closing it using the app, it’ll beep, like an alarm, letting you know it is closing. I thought that was a nice safety feature.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0

"I installed the myq garage door open/close app today. The software is absolutely horrible. When i press the button to open the garage door it opens but the app says its closed. Later the app says ""Open"" which closes the garage door. Did Chamberlain do no testing on this app. Why would they sell a product with such HORRIBLE software. The whole purpose of this app is to let us know if we forgot to close the garage door or to be able to open it remotely. Now I have to install a camera in my garage to double check that the app is not lying to me. I am so disappointed and expect better from Chamberlain. Until the software is fixed, I would NOT recommend this product.",1,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"So far so good.  Not using Alexa or Google Assistant to control this.  The app on the phone works just fine.  Set up was easy.

The one thing I do want to try in the future is the Amazon Key function for deliveries.  Like having peace of mind knowing my garage door is closed. There have been many times I've left in the morning and didn't have time to turn back to see if I had closed it.  Also have left it open a few nights.

"It is important to follow the instructions in their precise order.  That will elminate most headaches with a complicated installation process.  The area we stumbled is on how to put the existing garage door opener into ""learn mode"".  I needed to page down on the instructions on the phone to see more details related to my particular model.  You could stand there staring at the blinking light for a long time and not realize it was not working.  I think that there is upside to the usability in this area.  My suggestions to customers is to make sure that you find exactly the instructions for your opener and make sure you understand precisely what learn mode is.  One suggestion I would have for Chamberlain would be to have some audio beeps to provide feedback on the process while in learn mode.  You are standing near the device and it could flash or beep to let you know that it is making progress or stuck.  It's not that hard if you follow the instructions and don't get stuck at learn mode.  /Todd",4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"After 2 years of having this product, it's not something I'm super impressed with. Every time I open the watch app, it takes FOREVER to load the door status if it does at all. Sometimes it just says it can't authenticate in which case you have to look at a secondary way to operate the garage door, making the point of the remote garage opener moot.  The time lag between clicking on the app and the hub getting the message to close the garage door is pretty significant. Hopefully, there's a new version of this that's more reliable. But my advice right now would be to keep looking!",2,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
I had no issues what so ever installing this MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener.  Wifi has not been an issue and we are into our first week of use without any issues.  Our old Garage keypad stopped working before we installed this.  We are loving being able to go for a walk without having to carry an old opener.  The convenience of opening the door from our phone is amazing and we love that when we leave and question if we closed the garage we can simply check our phones to confirm that the door is closed!  Thank you for making this great product at such a reasonable price.,5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"Works as described. The setup was pretty straight forward without complications - if you are using an iPhone/iPad, follow the additional setup instructions included in the package for iOS users.

"It was a little difficult to install and were pretty technological savvy. We wanted to be sure we kept the safety function on the garage door for kids, animals, objects etc when closing the door. It does NOT integrate with Alexa. They should get on that which is the reason for the missing star. Bought this on a treasure truck and kind of assumed being pushed by amazon it would integrate.Other than that this is amazing! We use it often to open or close the garage. We have alerts set up to show when we’ve left the door open. And it works with the Apple Watch as well so if your hands are full or your phone isn’t handy you can still access the app. It also has a ten second alarm/beep that goes off to let you know the door will be closing soon which is a nice safety feature.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"I have a Genie Excelerator opener that supports 7 remotes.  When I set the MyQ up, it was device 7 and had communication issues at first.  It's more a problem with the opener than it is with the MyQ so I decided to clear all remotes, add/learn the MyQ first, then cars, and wall remote.  I eliminated one hand remote to remain at 6 configured devices.  Since then, the MyQ has worked perfectly.  I only mention for those who might have the same opener.  The app is simple to install and partially guides you through the MyQ configuration.  The instructions are clear for installing the hub and the door sensor.  I especially like the alerts that can be set up to send an app notification if the door is opened overnight.  So far, so good.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"It was on sales at a very good price (under $20). So I figured, why not.The installation is very simple.  Programming the hub for my opener is not as simple. I have a Genie opener and the instruction provided was not very clear. Still, it took me under 45 minutes to set everything up.  The unit worked for a couple of weeks. Then it would open but not close, cannot detect if the door is open or close. When I contacted support, I was given incorrect instruction (sensor needs to be lined up with the hub - it does not). I replaced the battery on the sensor, no help.  I contacted Amazon for a replacement and received it in 2 day (kudo to Amazon).",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

I contacted my internet provider, and they said everything is fine on their end. Back with tech support - some are more knowledgeable than others. It seems that if they get stuck they just hang up on you. That makes the whole experience even more frustrating. I returned it and will try a similar product from China instead.

it works with its App it will close the door for you if you leave it open other then that...  I wanted one thing to be able to ask Alexa if the door is open and if it was have her close it.  As far as I can tell it might be able to set it to close the door through a work around for Alexa that is not useful at all.  Thousands of devices have Alexa skills not this one.  if all you want is to be able to open close the door with the app and have it auto close the door at a time of day and maybe use the Amazon KEY program to allow Amazon to open the door and deliver packages then it will be fine if you want Alexa integration forget it.,3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I like the concept of this product.  However, app installation and setup was difficult - my family has both iPhone and android devices, and I consider myself tech savvy.  The app installation was extremely easy.  However, the setup sequence in the app was intuitive, but did not work.  I had to attempt several times on my primary device to connect the base station to the wifi.  I got frustrated and plugged in into a different outlet (away from the router), and the setup was suddenly complete.  Connection of the door sensor was difficult as well.  It took about 10 attempts to get the sensor to install.The real difficulty came with replacement of the home router about a week later.  WE upgraded our cable which required router replacement.  Getting the MyQ to reconnect to the new router was impossible.  It took almost 3 hours to do so, requiring me to completely delete the application from our devices, reset the MyQ hub on numerous occasions, and then had extreme difficulty hooking to the door sensor.  I got it hooked up to one sensor, then could not connect it to the 2nd.",2,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0

Everything seems to work except knowing the door position.  But this is a critical flaw.  I called tech support and did everything they suggested, nothing worked.

During installation, I found that the wifi signal reported by my phone was much higher than the myq device received.  My android phone would show 3 bars, but the chamberlain setup app only showed one bar for wifi.  The setup app gave me a warning that I needed a stronger signal.

"I moved into a home with an older Chamberlain garage door opener this year.  I had to find a remote to control it, and that was fine, but when I moved my mom into the room off the garage, I found myself having to carry my remote in and out of the house all of the time.  I needed another remote.  When I found this one that I could control from my phone, it was a welcome find!  I always carry my phone with me.I followed the accompanying installation directions and was amazed how simple the installation was.  As a 66 year old woman, I did not want complicated!  I was fortunate that the outlet to plug it in was already right where I needed it on my ceiling near the garage door opener.  Drilling holes to install the device on the ceiling went as planned.  The only question I had in the placement on the garage door was if it had to be placed on the first full panel or on the partial panel above it.  I put it on the first full one, though I don't think it would actually matter.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"The install was pretty painful. They don't verify that the door sensor is working during setup, so in my case the app failed (because the sensor wasn't working) and then told me that my garage door opener is not compatible (it is). There was no option to start over or try again without deleting the device and adding it again. Eventually I got it working though.My bigger complaint is that every time you use this thing, it emits an ear piercing, painfully loud siren and flashing a super bright light and delays operating the door for several seconds. This unbearable alarm then continues throughout the entire operation of the door and then continues for 10-15 seconds after. In my small, single car garage it's literally painful to the ears and blinding, and apparently there is no option to turn it off. I'm torn between returning the device and trying to crack it open and physically disable the obnoxious alarm.",2,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0

You also get alerts when the door opens or closes and you can see the status. Integration with google will cost money, but that is absolutely unnecessary to do if you simply use your own app. Seriously, your not going to use your google hub to open the door when youre a block away; youll use the myq app. Prior reviews fail to speak to the myq app which equates to an embarrassing review.

"As I understand it, this product does not work with Alexa. I debated back and forth about getting a garage door opener that works with Alexa. But, I have young kids who are very good at asking Alexa for things ;) So, I didn’t want them to open the garage door on their own. It does beep and flash lights when activated. I do not believe this can be turned off without voiding warranty. At first I did not like that feature, but it is there because of safety. The times that you would use this would be when you are not at home. The flashing lights and beeps alert others that the door is opening or closing so they do not get hurt. I have a Genie SilentMax and device connected just fine with it. I can open and close door with my phone. I think it works with most openers that have the floor level safety sensors.  Install was very easy after watching the official video. Instructions weren’t as clear as to where to put the devices. Video helped solve that!

I bought two hubs, since the hub was cheaper than the sensor alone on Prime Day.  So I have an extra hub.The instructions were straightforward and well-designed.  I made sure I was patient while the hub paired with my wi-fi router and each sensor paired with the hub.

"Every night before going to bed, my wife would walk into the garage for a few seconds, then come out, so I finally asked her why.  She said she was checking to see if the garage door was closed.  We had forgotten to shut the garage door, once, and a neighbor called to remind us.  So when my son in law showed me his MyQ, I ordered one the same day!  It was easy to install and is very easy to use.  Now every night before going to bed my wife checks her phone!  I like it so much, I recommended it to my neighbor who at least once a month calls and asks if her garage door is open.  If you have ever been asked if your garage door is open, you need this!",5,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"Overall, I like the product.  But I had some difficulty getting this working.  I followed all the instructions and things went well up until the end of the process.  Then the unit started getting confused about whether the door was open or closed.  Eventually, the unit lost it connection with the garage door opener, and could not get connected.  I did several factory resets and went through this multiple times.Finally, I called Chamberlain technical support.  They walked me through the same process and then mentioned in the discussion that there can be interference with LED light bulbs. BINGO!  I swapped the bulbs in my garage to regular incandescent bulbs, and everything has worked flawlessly since.",4,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0

"I purchased this MYQ product in August 2018, and have had significant issues with it since.  I tried using the support technicians, and they were very responsive, and helped resolve the problem.  But the problem of the APP not working continues to this day.  It installed easily, and it does work if I use the web site to open/close the door.  But the APP has serious flaws and will not work.  The tech had to install firmware to the hub (something only he can do), and then basically re-install the unit (re-connect to WIFI, link to garage door opener, etc.).  I've given up and will purchase the MEROSS unit that uses different technology (direct wire connection).",1,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0

I had a little trouble getting it on my wifi and had to try a couple of times but finally got it.

Such a great little device that ensures your garage is closed and safe.  Set alerts to let you know when it is opened or if it is being opened when you are not at home.  For such a low price it is great to have that comfort.  I wished I had gotten this sooner as we frequently go into the house without closing the garage and then it is open for hours.  I have a home garage gym and audio equipment for my patio I want to keep safe and locked up so this was a no brainer to get.I would recommend this to anyone who owns a home.  We have ours tied into our home security system for seamless operation and notifications.,5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"This product is extremely easy to install. The app guides you and makes it pretty dummy proof. From the time it was delivered on my front porch it took maybe 45 minutes at most to have it up and running. My only complaint is the Google assistant integration. Instead of being able to just tell Google to open/close the garage or ask if it's open or closed, you have to tell Google to talk to myQ, then myQ's annoying prompt speaks to you and you have to go through that and it asks which garage you want to know the status of even if you only have it on one garage.

My garage door opener is a 1999 Liftmaster, connecting the opener took four attempts which was noted in the installation guide.  It works like a charm, no problem whatsoever.  I was looking into buying this device for a while but some negative reviews discouraged me from buying until the recent price drop which made this so inexpensive that it was no brainer to buy and try.  I understand some negative reviewers have problem setting up the device.  There are so many small variables here, like wifi strength, door opener brand and model, interferences with other devices, placement of the opener and the device, and some other variables that could create problem for some users.  But unless you don't try it yourself you can't find out if this is the right device for your setup or not.  Also the installation guide is one of the best installation guides I've ever seen.

"I bought this in hours that it would have some integration with other services - yeah, not without their expensive Hub. The only things you can really do with this is open and close the garage door from the app, schedule it to open or close the door, and.... that’s it. Want it to open as you approach? Nope. Want to do things with IFTTT or any other service? Think again. But you can get Amazon Key deliveries with it. So I guess that’s something.This device is very much hobbled by the manufacturer so you have to purchase their hub.

It took me two tries to for this device to ""learn"" my garage door opener.Never use an LED bulb in or around a garage door opener.  It will put out a hash of interference which will make the radio receiver on the garage door opener very in-sensitive to your garage door clicker as well as this device.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0

Alexa controls are awkward, and I don't think I can use Alexa to open AND close door, but that might be a good restriction for safety reasons, as is the beeps added.  I guess the hardware is fine but app and cloud service need refinement.  Good value for price paid.",4,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0

I had recently bought a Chamberlain garage door opener to replace a failing unit on the 2nd stall. the MyQ settings for that were great. I wanted to have the same ability to check open/close of the door and to close remotely if I forgot to close the door when leaving. This hub did the trick for my 1st stall garage door.  Installation took about 30 minutes in all to do. pairing  to a Wayne Dalton Pro Drive garage door was straight forward and worked the 1st time. The door sensor is battery operated so will be interesting to see how long it lasts. I did not set it up for Alexa and do not plan to use that functionality of the unitl,4,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0

I am using one hub and the two sensors to control both my garage doors. I have the hub mounted on the ceiling in between both of the garage door openers.

You can set timers so that it notifies you if the garage door has been open for a certain amount of time (you can chose that time.... winter we chose an hour.

Love the product for the price.  Sends me a notification of my garage door has been open for over 2 hours and allows me to close the door wherever I am.My issue with the product was getting it setup.  My garage doors openers are both under 5 years old and manufactured by Chamberlain so setup should have been a breeze or so I thought.  For whatever reason the hub would just not sync with my garage door openers.

My wifi signal in my garage isn't great, so I thought I may be adding a wifi extender, but turns out that I didn't need to. It goes up or down when I tell it to, and that's all I needed since I had lost the only remote that I had for the garage door.

"It is pretty straightforward to install although you would want to play a bit with the distance on how far it is to the garage door opener. I have inconsistent operation when I put it at the recommended distance and had to put it closer but that might due to the LED bulbs I used in the garage. They emit EMF. I got it at Black Friday deal, so just $20 for me. Definitely worth the money. Now I can be sure everytime I drive off garage, it is closed. If not, I can just use my app to do it. Google Assistant integration works fine but pretty useless to me since it can only close and not open which I believe is a security concern.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,1
"Overall, I would say it is a great addition to my house.  My daughter has no garage door opener and I do not like the 'button' in your car that can open your garage.  A simple window break and they are in your house.  Well not with MyQ.  The installation was a little difficult and would suggest putting the devices together while doing the initial setup.  Now I can open my garage door, check how long it was open, etc.  A new addition or update to the software would be to open it only a certain distance like half or quarter! (hint hint).

THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE OPENER, it's the door sensor.  Why is it so difficult to acknowledge that???  I have not had peace of mind with this product, it keeps giving me false open door alerts.

To make is easier for others, keep the host unit close to the sensor when configuring it. Also keep the sensor at least 24 inches from the garage door openers antenna. This way it picks up the signal much faster. Once you have it setup, you can remove the garage door key fobs from your car to ensure no one breaks in and opens your garage door (easy access for crooks).

"I've had the product Installed for around 3 to 4 months. I'm pretty tech savy so it was easy to get it running.  Just think... if your garage opener battery dies,  like mine did last week, this saved the day until I got a replacement. I originally purchased the home gift for my husband but I think I like it more! Had my first  Amazon delivery in the garage, such a bonus! No worries about package pirates especially during the Holidays.  One side note, I did have to replace the batter in the sensor pretty quickly but that was super easy and those replacement batteries are cheap.",5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"Concept was simple. Installation was bumpy.  But is working good now.  Here are some tips.  Don't pull the battery tab out until it says so in the app.  Did it when I mounted on door and caused issue.  Had to pull battery out, reseat and start again.  Also, mount the server as close to the sensors as possible.  If you have 2 sensors mount equidistant between them.  I installed like the manual said ""within 4 feet of the opener"" but my furthest garage door sensor didn't work properly.  Reinstalled the server very close to both sensors and it has worked perfectly since.  Not sure why they tell you to mount close to opener since I think the sensors work via bluetooth.",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
The solution to accidentally leaving your garage door open. I installed on a single door garage with an existing Liftmaster opener. My wifi signal is strong in the garage so install was very quick and easy it almost seemed too easy to be correct. My struggle came with pairing with the iphone app. I called their customer service and was pleasantly surprised how knowledgeable and helpful they are. They had me up and running in 5 minutes. ( I called them on a Saturday). This is a must have if you have ever left your house and worried that you might have left your door up. Also useful for opening the door remotely to allow others access to make a  delivery while you are not home.,4,1,2018-9-30,1,1,0
"I was able to set up the MyQ device in less than an hour. Most of the time took mounting the hub and ensuring it could see the sensor.  I quickly was able to set up guests (my grown children that don't have remotes for our garage door) so they can access the door when necessary. Of course, when you have children that are comedians, they immediately want to play tricks and open the door when they are on vacation!  Having the alerts in place ensured I knew their game!  I also quickly set up a schedule so that the door will automatically shut at a certain time because sometimes people just forget to close the door! My next step will be setting up access for Amazon deliveries to ensure the security of my purchases!This is a great product so far and is a welcome addition to the other solutions I have in configured to have a 'smart' home.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"Simple to install, setup and use!!Hardest part about the entire process is getting on the ladder to place hub on the ceiling. Directions are short albeit well written, easy to follow. Took less than 15 minutes total to install and verify operation. One of the better benefits is being able to send temporary access to ‘guests’ who may use this to open the garage without having to share any passwords with ‘guests’ and then can remove ‘guests’ access at will as soon as the in-laws leave : )  highly recommend,",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,1
"It's an extremely finicky thing to set up as other reviewers have indicated. I wanted this because I am always worried I left the garage door open, and my mother in law who watches my kids at my house often leaves it open absent mindedly. I also keep my very expensive bikes in my garage, and I don’t want to be up for grabs. I had to do some trial and error to get it to work. For one, I recommend a WiFi extender if you have a detached garage as I have. Upon originally programming it seemed buggy. It deprogrammed all my other openers which I was able to reprogram without any issue. After the initial set up, the device failed to work. The device would simply not respond to open and close commands on my phone, even though it had the ability to know whether the door was open or closed. I knew it wasn't the WiFi because I was able to stream music and browse the web in my garage with no issues. I was ready to rebox the item and return it, but I wanted to give it one more try. Upon web searching some issues I found a page on Chamberlain's website that said your garage door motor CAN interfere with the hub if it's positioned too close to the motor. I previously had the hub on the inner side of the motor in the garage (further from the door). I then repositioned it to be on the other side of the motor (see the picture for reference, e.g. the correct positioning of the hub). I then wiped the hub's memory and reprogrammed it from the beginning. Other users indicated a second programming attempt solved their problems. For me, moving it further from the motor, specifically to the spot between the door and the motor, AND reprogramming seemed to do the trick for me. It has lost a connection once, but so far it's working fine.ONE WEEK UPDATE",4,1,2018-1-16,1,8,1
"Had this installed for just over a month and so far in that time I have had it lose connection 3 times, signal in my garage is full bars on my phone, but for some reason this loses connection. This alone wouldn't be a big deal EXCEPT for some reason when I open the app after this happens, it acts like I don't have any devices on the account, and makes me re-do the entire setup, re-sync the sensor, reconnect it to the app, HUGE pain in the butt, I have gone back to just using the remote on the door. Dunno what the issue is, the device or the app, but its a pain. Thankfully I only paid $20 for it on some Christmas flash sale so I don't feel like I lost out too bad, but still it is RIDICULOUS that the app doesn't remember the device when it loses connection. *Edit and update* got so bad I had to call their support, the guy was crazy helpful and walked me through the issue, very good on the company that makes this, I will update again in a month if I have no other issues*FINAL UPDATE! It has been working really well ever since I called their support line, if you have an issue, just call the help line, don't try and fix it yourself, the app for some reason wasn't going to a step I needed to do, and the tech directed me to the issue and helped me correct it, and now it works perfectly.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"Took forever to link with a Genie Powerlift 900; not exactly an exotic brand opener.  Don't know how I can get the door sensor much closer to the main unit, but they lose communication like the blind man and his deaf son.  I bought a TP Link wireless cloner and plugged it into the nearest outlet in the garage for the sole purpose of providing a strong wireless connection less than 15 feet away, yet I still can't just open/close the door from the app reliably.And I've had to go through the whole process of linking the door sensor to the main unit, and reconnect it to my wireless 3 times in the month I've had it.",1,1,2019-7-22,1,1,0
"Lost my garage door opener and before buy a new one tried to find something wifi connectable that allows me open/close the garage door from my phone. Ordered this one because already bought some openers from Chamberlain and had a good (quality) experience. Setup took about 20 to 25 minutes and is very easy. Works perfectly with my Genie opener and my phones. The only cons I have it could work with Apple Home Kit. A plus feature is the door status (if the door is open or closed). For folks who never remember if closed the door after leaving (like my wife), you can check the door status just checking the app. Got this unit for $50, a limited time deal, fair price. The regular price of $80 is too expensive. Hope it last long.",5,1,2019-4-28,1,0,1
"Product that I received clearly had been used and previously installed.  I first noticed the plastic strip to activate the battery was lose in the box.  Then I noticed THERE WAS NO BATTERY.  The Velcro installation strips had been glued to the back, and the mating pair of Velcro was missing (clearly had been installed on someone's garage door).  The unit was completely unusable.  And, yes, it is supposed to come with a battery.  I returned it immediately and will not do business with this supplier again.  I have a MyQ on one garage door already and it works great.  I had ordered this unit to add the other garage door.  Now, I will just buy a new hub and sensor at Lowes.  It is only $10 more than through Amazon, and I'll keep the second hub as a backup.",1,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0
"No monthly fees, easy installation, working flawlessly so far.  No Alexa skill but can integrate using IFTT (I will wait for the Alexa Skill).  Follow the instructions.  Any new Access Point or router with WiFi worth its salt will allow you to create a separate 2.4GHz network, which I did.  As such, I have not experienced the problems some have had trying to use dual-band deployments for the same SSID.  I created a ""Garage"" network with 1Mbps bandwidth limit and all is well.  My garage is flush with high-output LEDs and the opener the unit is adjacently mounted also has two LED bulbs.  The report about LEDs affecting the unit have not held true for me.  Time will tell the tale, but so far I'm pleased.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"Works fine, I had trouble installing from my Android phone app and had to switch to my wife's iPhone to complete installation. It only integrates with Google Assistant and not Google Home, which is a problem. There is no Alexa integration at all, which is a letdown. It would be nice to have an alarm sound followed by a voice alert either on the phone or preferably on Alexa /Google Home. If someone opens my garage in the middle of the night I am highly unlikely to notice a small pop up in app message or an email, it would be much better if it triggers an alarm with a voice alert/sound.",4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0

"Doesn't do a very good job at it's one fucntion: telling me whether the garage is opened or closed. It constantly losses sync. It's apparently not an active sensor. It doesn't actually send a signal every so often to poll the door position. It just sends one onnooen and close. I'm assuming it also doesn't monitor for a verification response. Because of this, the signal sometimes gets lost and the hub will read the wrong position. Pushing the sync button resends the position signal and corrects this. If you want something that works all the time, don't buy this thing. If it's not used that much, consider it because it's cheap.",1,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0

The all process was a little touchy and ornery when trying to establish Bluetooth/ RF can be a little aggravating when first setting it up but all is well by just starting over. So, hardware install is very easy but establishing all the required communication can take time. Do it do what it says.. Yep. Wow what a great conveniece that you can verify if the garage door is open or closed which is one less stress point in my life.It is still disturbing that it doesn't interface with Alexa, come on guys you need to be more customer conscious and give us back the skill.",4,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0
"Installation was straightforward and it does everything it said it would do.  I can see when my garage is open and for how long and I can open/close it from wherever I am.Words of warning:  I installed this in the middle of the afternoon and after a day or so I started getting random phantom openings.

"The set up was not to bad, but did take a while to pair with my garage door opener.  I did get them working.  But this device was listed as being compatible with Alexa, which it is not.  Seems like a huge over sight when developing a smart home device.  I should have done more research, but once it was installed I was not taking it down.  The integration with Google home is kinda clunky.  You have to first request to talk with myq then you can get it to work.  And if you have two garage doors it can struggle understanding.  If it was compatible with Alexa I would buy again and recommend.",3,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I love this product (after I got it installed). I’ve used it a couple of times to check my garage door status and close the door if I left it open. The app on my iPhone is beautiful and easy to use. My only problem was with the install. The quick start guide is worthless. Might as well toss it as soon as you open the box. As a former technical writer, I would be embarrassed if I wrote the install procedure for this product. YouTube videos helped me and when I got done, I thought it seemed so obvious. Why didn’t they write the install that way. Terrific product but don’t rely on the documentation supplied with it. Go online.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

We both had a problem remembering to close the garage door, or we would go somewhere and not be able to remember if we closed or not, so we decided to invest in this handy device!  It's nice not to have to replace the entire garage door opener.  It has an app that is easy to use and we can log on and check the ""status"" of our door (open or close) and you can set alerts, for example, we have our set to alert us every time the door opens or closes and when it stays open for more than 6 hours. It has been a life saver!",5,1,2019-2-14,1,1,0
"I love the installation videos. They are super easy to follow and very helpful. We got everything up and running through the MyQ app and IFTTT app, which easily integrated with Alexa. Make sure you follow the video instructions relating to the placement of the WiFi hub to the T because that can significantly impact its functionality.You won't be able to tell Alexa to open your garage (due to security reasons), but everything else works flawlessly! Also if you didn't already know this, when using the app to open/close the garage, you need to DOUBLE tap the circle to open or close the garage door.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
Okay so I was a little nervous to install it just because of some mixed reviews! But I gave it a try during a class break! I downloaded the app first! Made an account and followed the instructions from the app!!!! I plugged in the main unit! Made sure there was enough WiFi connection( again all of this are instructions from the app!) follow app instructions it took about 15 mins or less to set up! Now this device works! I needed it after husband kept leaving garage door open at night! I can schedule it to open or close at a certain time! And it notifies me when it has been closed or open! You do have to change settings to get notifications but I love this! Will update in a few months!!!,5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I was so happy to get this in just one day with Amazon Prime. And then I was super bummed to see that it was ""used"" not ""new"" as advertised. It was very obvious that the package had been opened, the screws had drywall on them still, and the back of the velcro tape wasn't sticky anymore, as it had been stuck to a door previously. Maybe this is why I had to reset the hub to factory settings before I could program it. Very deceptive to send me a used model, when you advertised ""new."" I would have returned it, but was going out of town soon and wanted it in place before I left.Because I have a Marantec garage door opener, and not one of the more compatible brands,  I can only monitor my garage door---I can't open or close it remotely. This is still helpful for peace of mind. So far it works as advertised. HOWEVER, it took me forever to get the hub/WiFi/MyQ app all straightened out. I watched several videos about installation and how to connect the hub to WiFi, read all the directions several times, and STILL it was super glitchy. Nothing like the straightforward videos I watched on YouTube. I had to turn off and restart my router to get it all to work. And I had to go through the setup procedure twice for it to work.",3,1,2018-1-24,1,1,0
"At this point I'm going to have to rip this thing out. The sensor is just too unreliable in it's connection with the Hub. They should have used a more reliable communication than Bluetooth or made the connection more robust.The sensor picking up the correct state is about a 50/50 chance each time I open the garage. I've tried replacing batteries, moving the sensor and hub positioning around and nothing seems to improve that accuracy. Seems like this is a common problem. It's just too unreliable to be used practically - I can't have a garage door open that gets stuck because it can't figure out what state it is in.",1,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"One of the worst things I have ever purchased from amazon. Bought it and hooked it all up. It may work once a week. My router is within 5 feet of the device. Everything is connected properly. I either get door sensor malfunction, or it says it has tried to many times and I have to manually do it. Most of the time though it just says opening or closing but the door doesn’t  do anything. Biggest waste of money. They also don’t tell you that it does not integrate with any smart devices unless you pay a monthly fee. Abosulutely ridiculous. If it wasn’t so much work to disconnect and pack up I would definitely send back. Horrible product and am so disappointed.",1,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
Once configured this works well with Home Kit/Siri.  I literally open and close my garage door every day only with Siri.  I have a bad habit of leaving the garage door open in the evening.  So I set a scheduled time for the door to close at 9PM if I forget.  My wife really likes this feature.  Setting all this up the first time was a little ugly.  I had to reset everything and start over twice.  The instructions that come with the devices is not great in my opinion.,5,1,2019-8-25,1,1,0
"I have had this product for about 8 months now and am less than impressed. The product works great if you just want to see if you left the garage door open or not, but if you use it to actually open the door then good luck. The problem it seems to have the most trouble with is when you are coming into range of your homes wi-fi and switching over from LTE. 90% of the time the app just hangs there and does nothing. To get around this I have to disconnect from wi-fi to avoid this. Another problem is that I constantly lose connection between my wi-fi or my smart hub that attaches to the garage. When I troubleshot this problem my garage door always gets removed from my app and I have to go through the whole process of reconnecting.The hardware is great, but the software is awful. Maybe wait for Nest or Ring to come out with something because the software engineers at Chamberlain just don't have the skills yet for smart home automation.",1,1,2019-1-28,1,2,0
"Bought this and a Ring Cam so I could finally stop driving all over town to different Amazon Lockers to pick up my orders since front door delivery is not an option in my neighborhood (packages are sometimes stolen), I thought delivery right into my garage would be amazing.  And it WAS… the first week.  Two deliveries on two different days were delivered right into my garage with no issues whatsoever.  It was amazing to come home from work and find my packages safe and sound in the garage.  But starting the second week, deliveries were just left at my front door despite all the messages I got from Amazon saying deliveries would be placed in my garage.  This is a total missed opportunity for Amazon.  People like me who work long hours would order more from Amazon if only the drivers would actually follow through and deliver inside the garage.  Instead, they just leave packages at the front door and drive off. The packages are not safe sitting out where anyone can walk up and take them.  It happened to me many times before.  And my chats with Amazon customer service were the worst.  Most of the time, Amazon put the blame on me, saying my garage door wouldn’t open (there’s no problem with my garage door) or the drivers didn’t know the code to open my gate (there’s no code, no gate) or they couldn’t find the garage (my house is very small.  My garage on the other hand is big and hard to miss.  Plus, I took a picture of the garage and posted it in the Key App, and left instructions to not leave any packages at my front door and to go the few extra feet to the garage and put the packages inside only) and they said I wasn’t selecting the in-garage delivery when I order stuff (tell that to the Key app that tells me I’ve got deliveries coming to my garage on the day of the scheduled delivery.  It even gives me blow by blow details of my delivery even telling me a time the delivery will be placed in the garage.  Why would it do that if I had not selected in-garage delivery?) I think the answer is the Amazon drivers are just lazy.  And no one is enforcing the in-garage delivery.  I have Ring cameras around my house and could see the drivers just pulling up, putting the packages on my front doorstep, taking a picture and leaving.  No attempt to go to the garage, no pulling out a device to open the garage door, nothing.  Just lazy.  And one driver put on the tracking that she handed the item to me at my garage door!  I was at work, so I would like to know how she handed it to me. I have her on camera leaving the package at my doorstep and getting back in her truck and leaving.  she never went to the garage or even acted like she was looking for it.  And during my chats with Amazon after they told me it was my fault and I argued my side, they just assured me it would not happen again. And then the very next delivery is left at my doorstep, again!!!Out of 8 deliveries I placed for in-garage delivery, only 3 were delivered into the garage.  The rest were just left at the front door despite me calling and complaining and leaving instructions in the app.  This could be a great service if ALL deliveries were delivered into the garage as promised.  I would buy so much more from Amazon if I knew the deliveries were safe in the garage.  So now, I am back to buying most stuff at Best Buy or having Amazon deliver to a locker clear across town.",4,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0

I did end up purchasing this product from another vendor. The product works excellently and integrates easily with my other door opener which has the Craftsman HomeLink. I can now control and receive updates on both my garage and workshop doors on the Chamberlain MyQ app. This allowed me to completely uninstall the Craftsman app. The MyQ-G0301 installed easily on my Genie opener in my shop. It only took about half an hour  total and I opted to drill and screw the sensor to the door instead of using the tape tabs.

But I have to say the 2 pieces are smaller than they look in the pictures and If you install it in one of the top corners, you wont even notice it.Installation:  instructions were straight forward. I was able to complete the installation in 30 min. I was a bit concern because I read another review that complained about instructions.. but for me was very clear.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0
"The description of this device does not inform you of a lot. It fails to tell you how/what the app is/not capable of doing. You can open and close the garage door. You can set it to open at particular times. But, you cannot close the door automatically or with some automation. The device works. But the app is lack luster and not able to do what (is no longer available) the MyQ wall button could do  - and that is automatically close your door at the defined time. As a result of this sorely lacking feature, I went with another product. I still have this one connected as a backup, but it isn't my ""go to"" for my garage door.",3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"After less than a year using the device, now it is completely useless since it is unable to operate the garage door  even when standing in front of it in my driveway. The application doesn't even notify or show whether the door  is open or closed. All seems to coincide with updating the app on my phone by mid February. Tech support was blaming my phone, but it communicates perfectly well with all my wireless devices. For now, the android application has rendered the device to nothing else but a gadget drawing electricity. I'll update this review if the app is corrected.",2,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"This device does what I need it to do. Installation was a breeze (except that I couldn't reach my garage ceiling to install the hub so I just sat it in the bracket with the door opener). Works perfectly with IFTTT, which was what I wanted it for. Now I have peace of mind when I leave home and can check that we put the door down. I know when my family members come and go, and most of all when I'm in bed on the 3rd floor and remember that the door is up, I can ask Alexa or Google home to put the door down for me. At the low price this item sold for (prime days), it was worth the money the first day we used it. Every day since has been a bonus...and Amazon Key is icing on the cake!",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0

5 stars for Amazon who was great with one day delivery. 1 star for installation because it sucks that they don't tell you that you can't set it up with an Android device. I cussed and swore at it for two hours trying to set it up. I finally went to YouTube and watched someone's video that advised to set it up with an ipad. I tried the ipad and had it setup in 10 minutes. WHY DO THEY KEEP THAT A SECRET ? I guess they like to frustrate and piss off new customers. Now that it's setup it works with my Android phone. You just can't set it up with an Android device. If you don't have an Apple device to set it up don't buy this product.,3,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"We ordered this as it was on sale, with everything being smart these days, and with the right price, this was a no-brainer. Installation only took minutes and it has paid off quickly.

""duh... we know it's open/closed, we're right here"", the one time my wife wondered, odd, we didn't get a closed alert and we logged in and what did you know, we forgot to close the garage. With the power of the internet....and.... Close.... :) .... completely worthy investment.We are still contemplating to take advantage of the integration with Amazon delivery.",5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
"I was excited for this item when it arrived. It was easy to install and seemed to work well out of the box. However, it began to fail when attempting to open and close the door with the app. I restarted the device and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app, per online advice, and while that worked for a single attempt, it failed to continue working. Also, while the safety beeping before closing might be helpful to avoid liability if someone is injured, it’s quite annoying for every day use.I’m a HomeKit fan and wanted to add my garage to the fold, but will need to wait for another product to make that happen.",2,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"When the price was $30, figured why not. I was pleasantly surprised. First it comes with everything you need. Syncing to my garage door opener ( mine is a Linear brand) couldn't have been easier. The app is easy to use. I linked mine to my wink hub so I can control through one app and that was easy as well.Doesn't impact any of your other controllers. It will send an alert whenever the door is opened. If you close your door via the app, be prepared for about 10 seconds of a warning beep before the door actually closes.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"I was needing an additional garage opener and a came across this item while searching. For $20 I figured why not give it a try. It took my husband 10 minutes tops to install it, my only complaint is it was a little hard to sync it with the app. This took about 45 minutes of trying and finally we were able to get it to connect and operate it with our phones. We haven’t had no problems yet, but we haven’t had it very long to speak on the longevity of it. My husband was able to open it from his moms house who lives about a mile away.

Traveling frequently and leaving keys out hidden in the yard were just not cutting it for us.  This allows us to be sure the door is open for family, friends, and our children when we need it to be.  It also helps me to remember whether or not I remembered to close the garage door.  Peace of mind is well worth it.

It was able to do this the first month I had the unit but lately it doesn't work at all. The app can recognize if the door is closed or open but it will not open or close the door.  I've waited on it for as long as 5 minutes for the unit to open or close the door and at that point, what good is it? I'm either parked outside the garage door or standing next to the manual button. So, this is junk as far as I'm concerned. I would spend your $50 elsewhere and on something that easily integrates with Alexa without charging a fee.",1,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"I just installed the unit. Took about 15 minutes. Seems to work fine so far. I would say this though; Have your smart phone with you at all times during installation. Thee are NO printed instructions with this product. Literally the documentation that DOES come with the unit says ""Download the app"".So, after downloading the app, It takes you through step by step instruction. In fact, theres a nice youtube video. The only hiccup I had, had more to do with my garage door opener. The ""Learn"" button on my unit looks Red, but is in fact Purple.

"Purchased this to be able to add the ability to open and close my garage door via my iPhone App.  It works great.  I am able to open and close the garage door from my phone and Apple Watch.  Unfortunately, on top of buying their hardware, they force users to pay a subscription if they want to be able to open their garage door directly through Alexa or Google voice command.  Their app doesn’t allow to close the garage door after a set amount of time which is very unfortunate.  That functionality that is available on their newer doors would be a great addition!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"Love the product if you follow the videos, not the written instructions. I had an issue linking it up when I mounted the hub by the opener first.  Do not do that. Mount your garage door sensor on the side of the garage closest to the wifi router. The plug in your hub within a few feet of the sensor. After it's all linked up then unplug and move the hub to the location you want to put it in.Recieved my first amazin delivery using amazon key because of this.

Which appeared to be some partnership to make the premium membership free. Which it is. For a “limited time”.  And when that time expires, it’s $10/year or $1.00/month.",2,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I was gladly surprised that this worked with my older garage door mechanism. Set up was well detailed.  Glad that it gives me a status on my garage door.  I have it tied to both Alexa and Google.  Frankly, Google is easier to use.  The reason is that Google can be set up with a simple command, ""Close the garage door.""  Alexa, after being set up, requires a command that includes the word ""trigger.""  ""Alexa, trigger close the garage door.""  Don't forget that word ""trigger"" or it's not going to work.  I also haven't found a way to get either Alexa or Google to ""open"" the garage door - only close it.  Either I'm missing something or maybe it's a security issue.  I wish I could do both.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"It's ok, and the remote opening/closing comes in handy.  Often times, though, it shows the door status as the opposite of what it actually is... It's not very consistent and, yes, I checked the orientation of the door sensor.  Luckily, I have a camera I can check to see where the door is, because I don't really trust the MyQ...Also, I had to replace the door sensor battery immediately upon installation, because it was too week to complete the 6 beep test (read the instructions).",3,1,2019-5-27,1,1,0
"Integration with Google assistant does not allow opening of the garage.  It will let you close it, or check on status - but not open.  Same for scheduling from within the app - you can only set a schedule to close it - which is just about useless.  Overall, I consider it an almost complete waste of money.To be fair, the installation was a breeze, it paired with my 1994 model Liftmaster on the first try. The few things it allows you to do it does reliably.",2,1,2019-11-5,1,1,0
"Not sure WHY I had to reset occasionally, but sometimes I get a message on the app stating it is no longer paired to the unit.  Resetting is simple, but it entails getting a ladder and being in the garage with my phone to do so.  This means I would lose the ability to monitor/control the garage doors if I were away from the property, which was a big factor in purchasing.  The other factor was the CLOSE ON SCHEDULE option offered by the app.  My husband forgets to close the door at night, and I am able to set both doors to close at 10 PM if they are not already closed.  Awesome.  This feature did require the purchase of an additional module ($40).",4,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0

I have had notification delays of up to 30 min.  That would be critical if/when the door opening is unexpected or accidental.

It seems that if it is not used frequently (which happens a lot, since there are other remotes available for my garage door), then it can't perform the remote well. It also seems that it has more problem with closing the garage door vs opening it, which is weird (I presume closing it should have less problem, since there's no need to authenticate the message).",3,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
Finally installed it last week and it works perfectly. Took me about 30 min to put it together. Very easy to install. I love it and now the notifications helps me a lot if/when in forget to close the garage door. We don’t have amazon garage or in-house delivery available yet in our area but hopefully soon.Having a remote keypad to open/close migh seem like a redundant effort but I think it has more uses than the keypad. You don’t have to give out your garage keypad code to anyone anymore. The notifications definitely help out with securing your property,5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"This took several hours to install. Then our garage door started opening on its own, around 6 at night and 6 in the morning. It would say it was open on the app, but when you got home it was not.

For a buck a month, you can pair it up with Alexa using IFTT, but I did not do that and very happy with it straight out of the box. I can open and close the door and get notifications locally and while out and about. A great starter for people who want to know if they like home automation. For 48 bucks, what do you want.

"I thought with the way the description was written that it was Alexa ready. It is not. I do like the device in that it was fairly easy to install and the remote app on the phone is fair. However, I don't think it really wouldn't take much for programmers to add this device onto the Alexa platform. Then I could use my auto Alexa to open my garage. I also did not like how loud the warning sound is when closing the door. It is a bit excessive. I have it in an enclosed tub and I can still hear it way too loud. I am hoping that they can add this to the Alexa platform. I would definitely change my rating to a five star then.",2,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
Great idea but the reality is very poorly executed. I have been locked out of my home multiple times while the app fails to load or the Internet connection seems unstable. To use this product you must first launch the app on your phone and hope it loads correctly login and wait for it to recognize your password wait for the Internet connection to be transmitted back-and-forth wait for the opener to connect to the Internet and receive the signal and many times something in that situation fails to work properly and you can spend 5 to 10 minutes waiting to get into your home sometimes unsuccessfully,1,1,2020-5-12,1,0,1
"This is a functional device with crippled software application.  They advertise Google and IFTTT compatibility (*super fine print) with a Subscription fee, didn't see that before I bought it.  Who does that in today's economy?  Fine, I will pay you the $1/month or $10/ year to get integration with my Google Home..... but wait, Google Assistant, not Home.  What is the difference you ask?  Instead of saying  the intuitive ""Hey Google, close the Garage Door"" I have to use the the less intuitive service ""Hey Google ask MyQ to close the Garage Door"" not that big of a deal.  BUT WAIT!  It can't open or close the garage door..... by design?????  It can tell me if the door is open (like my eyeballs) but it can't open or close the door via Google Home.  I can open the App and press the button in the App, but honestly, unless I am in bed, isn't it easier to just hit the button on the wall at that point? Then why two stars and not one?

"I had high hopes for this product - it has generally good reviews and I’ve had strong experiences with other Chamberlain products. After a very frustrating setup process (involving difficulties with getting connected to WiFi and reaching the limit of # of connected remotes for my garage door opener) it mostly works, but it isn’t 100% reliable, occasionally disconnecting from our WiFi network (despite me verifying a strong signal in the garage). I’m not comfortable counting on it for Amazon Key delivery.Additionally, app control through Google Home does NOT work as conveniently as other smart products. You can’t just say, “Hey Google, open the garage door” - you have to follow a specific syntax to talk to the MyQ service through Google. Plus, you CANNOT open your garage door via Google Home. You can only close it or ask for the status. Why???",3,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0

The app and install went smooth.  The only reason for 3 stars is their Learn color coding for my Liftmaster door was not correct and linking two doors was not easy.  The learn button is orange and it would not link to the hub.  After trying it 10 times I started hitting the other color options on the app and sure enough purple linked the first time.  Other than that the app and door notifications have been great.  I also linked two doors to one hub.  I had to watch a YouTube because it wasn’t intuitive enough for me to figure it out.It also does not work with Alexa.  Not a show stopper but would be nice.,3,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

Just bought and installed the MyQ device (11/2019). I had some initial difficulty getting it to pair with my older Liftmaster opener but reset everything and it now seems to work perfectly. Installed a second sensor on my smaller door.I'm fortunate to live in a neighborhood where my kind neighbors have let me know when my door is open and they've even closed it for us in the past when we weren't home. But the MyQ device and app certainly add a level of security knowing I can check and close the door from anywhere.

"This product was a absolute headache the second I got it. Took a few hours to get set up because it wasn't pairing with my Craftsman garage door opener. Once I finally got it to work it only managed to work for 2 days until the app decided to delete the hub. Trying to go back through the steps to relearn the hub it would open the garage door and close it 2 times and still manage to somehow say it failed to pair. I then decided to do their support chat where whomever I was talking to started out professional. He then asked me for my password to try to add the hub manually from his end, I obviously declined to give him my password because that is terrible practice. Before I was able to to send him anything back after declining to give him my password he took it upon himself to abruptly end the chat.

I bought this because I had been looking into a way to allow access into my garage remotely since My wife and I don’t always carry our keys with us. This offered an affordable solution that worked with current garage door. The setup was pretty understandable in the instructions but it took a few times to get it to sync properly. The phone app works every time but I try to use it frequently with my Apple Watch and it only works about 50% of the time getting stuck loading causing me to wait about 2-3 minutes before the app finally times out.

The app will tell me and I can close it from my phone. Nice! Unfortunately, it does not integrate with Alexa.

You still have to order two hubs so you can get the second door sensor that tells whether your door is open or closed, but you won't actually be installing the second hub part as one will control both doors. The app will actually walk you through the correct steps for one door, and then ask you if you have a second door as well.

I only have 1 original remote for each garage and was always looking for one. Very easy to install. Download the app first and follow the easy directions and videos. I think it took me 15 minutes. Now, no remotes needed, just a tap of the button on the app. You can open and close the door wherever you are and set up alerts if door is opened or closed even if someone is not using the app. I know it has alexa control and can give permission for prime delivery but I have not used those features yet.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0

I love being able to check on my phone whether I remembered to close the garage door, and to shut it if I forgot!",5,1,2018-4-10,1,3,0
"I had some trouble at first getting it to work, but they did an update and it linked up to my opener easily after that.  I have noticed that the history seems to be about when the app was used to open and close the door rather than when the door itself was actually opened.  If you have 2 Garage Doors, buy the extra sensor so you can use it to open either door.  You can name the doors anyway you want so it is easy to know which one you open.  I like the guest function if someone else needs in. There is a visual and audible alert that sounds for quite awhile before the door starts to close, and then you have to allow time for it to actually close and for the communications to update over the internet. Be sure to allow plenty of time for the door to open or close",3,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
Bought this on sale.  Setup was extremely easy.  Others note some difficulty and I'm guessing they struggle with tech.  You can skip reading the paper instructions and just open the app.  It will guide you step by step.The reason for 3 stars:. No Android widget.  The app takes a few seconds to get you to the open and close screen.  They charge for integration.,3,1,2019-6-23,1,0,0
"First, I have three garage doors.  Maybe it was poor research on my part, or bad documentation on the vendors part;  This product only supports 2 sensors.  If you want a third sensor, you need another hub.Second, the sensors kept getting an ""unknown"" error, and then disconnecting from the hub.  It would require me to repair the devices.  I have had to do that about 3 times within the first month.  When you're using this as part of your security, reliability is essential and this product isn't reliable.",2,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"The concept is good, but the software has some quirks. It’s happened twice that the sensor had an error and the entire system wiped itself. So when I checked my phone, there were no garage doors installed anymore and I had to reset up everything. Also, there is a flashing alarm and beeeping noise that goes off before the garage closes. Cool safety feature, but it’s very annoying especially because it beeps for almost a minute even after the garage door is fully closed. It’s loud and there’s no way to decrease the time. Not sure why it doesn’t stop once it’s closed. The software in general is okay. Would be nice to have a quick shortcut or easier way to open  and close the garage door instead of having to sign into the app each time.",3,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0
"I left home and came back to my garage being left open one time and I decided to get a Wifi device for my garage so I know if it is left open and can close it remotely. This was on sale for $20 during Black Friday and it was a no brainer to buy.Super easy to install. Plug in the hub, sync it through the smartphone app and connect to your wifi network. Install the sensor on the garage door as instructed and pair it to the opener. Very simple to install, even easier to use the app. Now I get notifications when the door is opened and closed, provides great peace of mind.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I am med-high tech savvy. MyQ worked fine with ATT UVERSE router, once I replaced with a new Orbi Mesh, it cannot connect to the wifi. I tried all the magic tricks in the internet (disable 5.0ghz, moved close to router etc'), nothing.I have over 10 other wifi devices in my home, IOT plugs, speakers, water irrigation.. all works. this MyQ after 2 weeks still not. Support doesn't do much than repeat what I already did. Sorry, but if your product can't make a connection work, you should not be making this product. RELIABILITY AND EASE OF USE...

Good step-by-step instruction and made it work in about an hour.  It gave us the peace of mind that my wife will not need to ask me to drive back to check if our garage door is closed:-)A couple of notes for future users:,5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"I wanted to control my garage door remotely.  This was easy to install much like you would adding another garage door remote.  You use your garage opener's learn button to scan for the MyQ opener.  Once it's added, you can see the current status of your door if it's open or closed.  It opens pretty fast, but closing takes a long time because it requires it to flash some lights and beep a bunch or time to warn that the door is about to close.  There's a service fee to add google home / alexa capability, but if you have a Smartthings hub, you can add that and do it for free.  Doesn't cost you anything if you just want to control the door using their app.",5,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
I like the smart garage door opener. It gives us peave of mind when we have left the house that our garage door is closed.  There is a delay when getting the alert on my smart phone of the garage opening and closing.  Amazon attempted to make a delivery while I was out of town and there was an issue with the smart system making the garage door go down. The delivery person would not go into the garage and hit the manual button to reset the smart system or respond to be via security camera. It timed out due to multiple attempts by the delivery person. It was very frustrating and I have decided to not use it for Amazon deliveries if I'm out of town.,5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
This works great with the app on both the iPhone and Apple Watch for opening and closing the door once it is installed. I’m pretty tech savvy and I had a hard time getting it to connect to an existing lift master garage door opener. To install and connect you use the app and it guides you through. However my jack bolt style garage door opener was not in the list of openers to connect to so the my Q device wouldn’t connect. After an hour of trial and error I finally got the right combination and it has worked flawlessly since. App was worthless to solve the problem as were online instructions.,4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
I have been in the Garage door Business for 30+ years. The idea behind this is great. Sadly this does not always work and that was a big issue with my wife. Sometimes it will only open the door 2' and stop. The door works perfectly when I remove the unit so I know it is not the door. Or the opener. I believe Chamberlain and Liftmaster have the best openers but their support for this has been worthless. On hold for over 30 min to get we do not know or the door is not working properly is just not acceptable. Buy at your own risk!,2,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"Obviously the ability to check your garage door from anywhere a cell or wifi signal is available is the #1 advantage of this device. My only frustration came during installation, having an older Craftsman door opener with a model number unknown to the Chamberlain web site. So discovering the correct coding for the device to work with my opener was tedious. Beyond that, the device works very well and I'm happy to have purchased it.",4,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0
"1st off, I'm not handy. Right off, I did not have a wall mount control as was pictured in the manual, but pretty close. I found one online to see how it was paired. OK! Got that done. When I tried to key the router password for the myq, my keyboard blocked  the box. I couldn't see what I was typing. A little frustrating. So it took a couple o' tries. But I got it! Ok, my fault, I know. Then I only saw part of the installation video. It just stopped. Luckily, the manual is EZ to follow. So I got 'er done. And my wife and I LOVE it.

"I was skeptical when reading some of the negative reviews whether or not to order this product, but I figured with the Chamberlain name, I ordered it. I had this installed and running in less than 20 minutes, it was simple and the set up guide in the phone application was more than helpful. I had the hub connected and the door sensor paired in no time. The hub paired to my Craftsman opener the 1st time. I LOVE that I can see the status of my door, and the fact that I can set up a daily schedule to close the door at 8:30pm. The notifications are handy as is the history of openings and closings. I am really happy I bought this product, 10 stars from me.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"The device is quite small, the main hub is not much larger than a hockey puck maybe 4""x4"" and the door sensor is maybe 2x2. The door sensor sticks to the door with Velcro, the hub to the wall or ceiling with two screws through a mount plate. Took about 10 minutes to install following the on screen steps from the app. Proceeded to install the app on the kids' phones, and all work just fine. You link the hub to the door opener by pushing the link button on the opener, and mount it. It acts like any remote, except it's connected to your WiFi and the internet, and then to your phone via the app.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Wonderful product, was ordered, shipped and received promptly.  Installed hardware, and two remotes to two garage doors in less than one hour, including time to hunt down ladder and tools.  Installation instructions contained on app were clearly written, easy to understand and follow.  Only drawback in my case is the fact I ordered these so that I could receive my packages from Amazon with their Key App.  Unfortunate to find out it is currently unavailable in my area.  Also have not been able to integrate into Google Home Hub, but works fine independently with App.  No regrets though, it is a good app to inform if garage doors are operated.",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
thought was pricey when bought but well worth the money; mainly wanted for ensuring garage doors were closed after a forgetful opening of the door and needed for the second door.  the app tells me the status and I have no problems with the use of app; compatible with IFTTT and WINK with other services.  allows me peace of mind and the ability to open for early family arrivals as well as package deliveries.  works with hub as described in website description.,5,1,2019-7-16,1,1,0
This is the dumbest smart home product I’ve ever had.  I had to reset this thing at least once a day for the first 3 days I had it setup.  I’m guessing if the Wi-Fi goes out you have to reset it and if the power goes out you have to reset it.  Every time he reset it you have to reset the entire thing.  The set up process is defective and doesn’t work well with iPhones.  When it does work I do like it  and I’m not ready to quit on it yet.,1,1,2018-12-19,1,2,0
"It was a very easy setup for the hub and even easier for the app for our phones.  Only issue is with Alexa to open and close the garage door.  You have to install IFTTT and connect to Alexa.  However, you can only close the garage door, not open with Alexa (something about not allowed because of safety issues).  We no longer have to worry about leaving our garage door open plus when we travel, we are notified when someone access the garage door.  Very cheap way to be able to monitor, open and close your garage door from anywhere in the world.  BTW, there is NO subscription fees for now for using IFTTT or Google Assistance (changed June 26, 2019).",5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
Installation process is “ok” but been on with tech support 3x already.  Device gets “glitch” - a word the techs use.  Tech support generally is a re-installation.  Link with Amazon Key was easy - but when delivery team can’t get Q Hub to close the garage door - less than effective.  Generally seems like there is interference from either opener or LED lights that is corrupting functionality.My understanding from tech support is the that Q Hub will no longer connect to Alexa.  So no asking Alexa to open/close garage door (or ask her if it’s open).,3,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I have had nothing but inconsistent performance since installing a week ago. Door sensors don't stay paired, and the app periodically doesn't show the correct state of the door, or gives no indication at all if the door opens or closes. I have no confidence that this product is accurately telling me if the door is open or closed, or that 8 have the ability to close it, or know that it's closed if I am away from home. Often it operates properly, but invariably in the morning one of the sensors will not be paired and I have to start the process over. If it happens to lose hub connection when I'm out of town, I would have no way of re-pairing the sensor. I can't believe the product can be this bad. Troubleshooting steps on the website so far hasn't been helpful and the phone support, though good, has only been able to help re-pairing the sensor, but can't solve the subsequent loss of connection that periodically occurs. I'm happy to edit this review when and if I get this resolved, but at this point would definitely not recommend it.",1,1,2019-5-17,1,1,0

"Do not rely on this as an alternative entry tool. Constantly and usually at the worst time possible goes completely unresponsive when trying to open the door. Went on a walk and used the app to close the door (no issues here) so I wouldn't have to hassle with locking doors. I realized I had forgotten my keys inside but didn't worry about it since myQ seemed to be a suitable alternative. On my return however I spent over an hour stuck outside my residence with no way back in to the point I had to seek assistance from a friend. Other times I used it as a way for relatives to come by without needing a key where they met a similar fate to mine.In the end, 2 stars for the few times the app would work but only when the regular remote was in grasp. Horribly unreliable.",2,1,2019-6-15,1,1,0
"The install was really annoying. I had to restart the multiple times on my phone. And every time you restart you have to flash the device. I couldn't get it to pair to my garage door opener at all. Literally tried for hours. Looking around yieled that you could pair it outside the app via button combos. We did that and during the pairing phase in the app it opened and closed the garage but the displayed a failed to pair dialogue. Very frustrating. Finally got it to work after several restarts. For some reason it unpaired all my garage remotes. The ceiling mount is hard to drill and unessecary. The device is light, you can mount via command strips.",3,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0

The only part that took any time was picking the mounting location and drilling the holes.It does beep continuously to warn you when it is about to open and close and during the process.  It is pretty loud and continues to been even after it is fully open/closed, maybe 15 seconds after.  Not a big deal.  Just slightly annoying.",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"I like it.  It's simple.  It was very easy to install and setup.  The MyQ app appears to do the basics you'd want it to: you can open/close the door remotely and you can create a schedule that will tell the door to close at a certain time if it is not yet closed.  However, there is no Alexa integration.  This is surprising since it allows AmazonKey integration.  You cannot, therefore, include it as part of an Alexa Routine.  For some, this might be a bummer -- especially if you like all of your devices under one roof.  However, this will likely not be an extremely sad thing for most.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

I've been anywhere from 20 minutes to over 1 hour & 1/2 away and can open my garage door when I receive packages, or just check that I did close it in a rush to leave.  Installation is relatively easy did have to call support for assistance in getting linked in but they were great & professional & had me solved in a matter of minutes.  Seriously people end the question did I close the garage door, and worrying about when packages are delivered if someone is going to steel.  Best thing ever.

"I don't write reviews often but felt one was warranted for this product. Setup was inconsistent and flaky. I ended up going through the setup process four times before one of two doors was connected. I moved to the second door and got the error message that I had too many doors installed on this hub. I looked on Chamberlain's site and saw other having this issue. I tried several steps others had mentioned, factory resetting the hub, uninstalling the app from my phone, uninstalling the door sensors from the app, etc and nothing worked. Someone on Chamberlain's site indicated that the techs even had them unscrew their light bulbs from the opener (I hope they were making this up but somehow feel they weren't). After going through another factor reset, I finally ended up changing the name of the hub on my app and both sensors were picked up. As I went to program the second door, the hub synced to the door just fine, but then both doors were controlled at the same time. I then followed more instructions online, resetting the rolling code, re-pairing all of my openers, factory resetting the hub again, re-pairing all of the doors, and still the hub controlled both doors simultaneously and not independently. I have two seven year old Chamberlain garage door openers with multiple handheld Chamberlain garage door remotes, a Chamberlain keypad for exterior use, and two car home hubs all paired with the garage doors and operating each independently. You would think this Chamberlain product would pair to their  openers without  issues but I’m not finding that is the case.",1,1,2019-2-2,1,1,0

"It took 15’ to install, very simple. And it’s been working as expected for a week now (I did some different test scenarios initially as well). A minor complaint is that it enables you to set an alarm if the garage door remains open for, say, 15’ during night time, and this would send you a notification but would not let you set an action to close the garage door. You can only schedule to close at specific time but not upon a triggered alarm. So instead, I have to schedule a door closing every 30’ during night time (10+ schedules).

Surprised there wasn’t anything to be found online.  When pairing you select your garage door manufacturer as Security+ 2.0 (not Liftmaster).  Security 2.0+ is really the sub-name and model of later Liftmasters, despite not being written anywhere on the device itself.  You also select the Yellow button.

I currently have the app set to notify me whenever the door opens or closes, which may eventually become too much, but for now, I like knowing that it is working.This has been the solution we were looking for, and the price was by far better than any other options we considered.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

Using my iPhone or Apple Watch to open my garage is only successful about 30-40% of the time. It just spins and/or tells me my hub is not responding. Once it’s open it works to close it. But what good is that once I’m inside?  My hope was to utilize this to gain access to my garage without my remote should I come from the back of the house.

I ended up moving one of my Arlo cameras to the garage so I could verify whether the door is really open.

She kept blaming different stuff like a weak WiFi signal (which it wasn't) and then telling me I had to move the sensor a little more to the right or I had to get the hub 2 feet closer to the opener.

Hardest part of installation was figuring out which method of pairing my garage motor to the sensor unit I needed to use. In the end I just tried them all until it worked. The one that did the trick was Liftmaster with the yellow button even though mine has a red button. Either way, now that it’s working it’s been bulletproof! Well worth the money and time spent on install",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"As a techy guy I didn’t sync it up with Alexa or Google assistant just for security reasons. You really don’t need to order Alexa to close your garage door. The installation is pretty simple. You only need a drill, a screwdriver, and a ladder. The sync process with your garage door could be tricky, do not press the purple button before the app tells you to or you will need to repeat the process a few times. Other than that works perfect and it will give a piece of mind to know your door is closed when you are not home.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
This performs as expected. Set-up initially did not go as easy as expected. Company was in process of pushing out an update and were having problems. As such at the time I installed it required a call to their tech support to complete install as they had to work around issue. I have had this installed for several months now. Works very well. I have this installed on both of my garage doors. Definitely makes closing door easier and you can definitely teelif you left the door open. Also great for allowing the plumber or electrician in while you are somewhere else.,5,1,2018-10-17,1,1,0
The only plus is that this is easy to install. I’d read a lot of good reviews but I’m disappointed in the opener. The app takes forever to load and I have to log in each time to close the garage door. Then it doesn’t update properly and says that the garage door is open when it’s really closed. Also I can no longer use the remotes that came with my garage door which is part of the reason I got this in the first place as I wanted to give my remote to my babysitter and then still be able to close the door with my phone. Overall  I wouldn’t buy this again.,3,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts but only one garage.  We bought this so we could both use it to have packages delivered to our garage when we are out of town.  The garage door control works perfectly, but not so much when you try to link it to your Amazon Key account.  What Amazon fails to warn you about is a restriction they have in the Key app that only one amazon account can be linked to the garage door control.  That means that only one of us can use the garage delivery feature when ordering from amazon.  The fix is simple, just allow accounts that are linked through household sharing to both use the Amazon Key app for package deliveries.  Hopefully they will make this change in the app.  Otherwise, just be aware that you will have to purchase and install one of these devices for every  amazon account you want to use it with.",2,1,2019-5-3,1,1,0
"For starters, this is super easy to install and works perfectly!! The only issue I have is that there is no way to connect it to Alexa as of yet.

I’ve actually had this product almost a month and I was about to send it back but I called their 800 number and the lady was wonderful She was on the phone with me for over an hour and made sure that it was up and running I actually love this product don’t need a house key anymore each of my children have downloaded it to their phone so that they can get in and out of the house but I’m actually loving this product it tells me when it’s open how long it’s been open how long it’s been closed so I’m definitely glad I picked up this deal awesome product,5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"This thing is just not too reliable. It will work fine for a couple weeks or months and then it will stop registering when it's open and closed. Went out on bought new batteries for the sensor and everything, but no luck. Talked to support and reset everything. Worked for a few weeks and stopped working again. What I usually do now is just hit the button on the sensor and that like re-syncs it and it will start working....but just for a few weeks.It's pretty annoying. I suggest to spend a little more and get one you can trust.",2,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I paid 30 bucks for this and all I wanted was something I could open and close my garage remotely with.  The best part about this is Amazon can deliver inside of your garage where your stuff is safe from thieves.  Alexa integration sucks and IFTTT intigration is ok if you like to leave locations on all the time on your phone.  I wish you could remotely open it when you got close to home but I can see why that would be a security risk.  30 bucks, worth it, any more I dont think so.  at least the subscriptions are free right now but I dont know for how long",4,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
This worked to replace my Craftsman Model 139.3043 with Assurelink (Yellow Learn Button).  5 months ago the App quit working for the Wifi system I bought in 2010 and it was driving me crazy not being able control garage remotely and check status. The install took less than 30 minutes most of it was deciding where to place the new controller and drilling. We had no issues...the Mobile App was clear and easy to follow.

"The myQ Garage Door Opener is a great investment! I only wish I'd have known about this before Christmas! My packages are now delivered into my garage and I don't have to worry about ""Porch Pirates"". The delivery driver gets a ""single-use"" code to access my garage, they drop the package, take a picture of the delivery, and I get notified on my phone. Bounus - I get a notification on my phone as soon as my garage door is opened and closed.Aside from that I also can use my phone to open/close my garage door from anywhere. I can let my mom, a friend or whoever I choose inside my house remotely.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I really like this product. I was worried at first but it does exactly what I want it to do. I needed another remote for a different car, and this cost less than a standard remote (especially on sale!) and extends functions to warn me that the door is open, and can be opened wherever I have connectivity with my devices, not just when I’m sitting in the driveway. Once I opened the door for my wife who went out for a walk, and the battery had died in the normal keypad, and I was in a different state! Needing to have my phone available when I want the door open or closed is a tiny inconvenience in the car sometimes, but it’s not so bad once you learn to have your phone where it’s accessible. Installation was easy and so far it works flawlessly.I wish Alexa connectivity was easier; I think it will work, eventually, but I can’t get it to work yet. They (MyQ and Alexa) seem to communicate with each other, but I can’t get the Alexa to open or close the door- maybe I’ll get it figured out, but that wasn’t the top of my “must do” list.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"My old craftsman garage door opener that came with the house died so I bought the Chamberlain with MyQ. What a smart move. Matches the track and bolt configuration of the old Craftsman I replaced so super easy to install. Same as the app. Fantastic. Then I bought the hub for the other side and it worked like a charm and again, super easy to install. They truly make it idiot proof, especially when using the YouTube video for easy installation. On a scale of 1 to 10? A 12! I will never ever again have to leave the house, drive 2 miles down the road and wonder if I left the garage door open, just look at the app. Good job guys and gals who created the system!!",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"Honestly had a bit of trouble getting this set up. It turned out, however, (after doing multiple Google searches. resetting the main unit, and uninstalling and reinstalling the door sensor), that the app (Chamberlain myQ) needed to be updated. Since this was done the unit has performed flawlessly, even through power failures. I'd like a few more options in the software, but the device does what it claims to do and I would recommend it to anyone looking to monitor and control their door remotely (works with WiFI, per the description, so can be used virtually anywhere in the world).",5,1,2018-9-10,1,1,0
"The product works well, that isn't my issue. What IS my issue is Chamberlain has chosen not to play nice and charge you if you want to integrate with your home automation controller. I have so many gadgets, I don't want to have to use a separate app for each of them. Unless you are willing to pay a monthly fee, your only option is to use their app. Want to say ""Google - open my garage door"" on the way home? $$$ Very disappointing. I should have opted for a zwave device instead, but will probably keep it since I already installed it.",3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"Love this thing, as I now don't have to come back home to be sure that I closed the garage door (a frequent occurrence as I drive down the street :-)  Only negative is that I did not find it easy to install.  The included instructions didn't work for me.  But, calling the Chamberlain help line worked great.  They were very helpful in walking me through the install and staying on the line until is was done.  The biggest thing I learned is that the unit doesn't have to be mounted on the ceiling, but anywhere in the garage where you have power and a line of sight for yourself and the garage door opener.  (Unfortunealty, found this out after I changed to a 2 plug ceiling receptacle to power this unit and the opener.)",5,1,2018-12-8,1,0,0
"I got this one as I needed extra remote and turned out for about the same money I could get more than just a remote but ability to monitor and control my door from anywhere I go.Negatives, if installed too close to the opener motor, it may get confused and drop the connection. After weeks experiencing issues when I first installed it, I finally called support and they explained to position it further. So instead of the ceiling next to the opener, I attached it to side wall and since then for more than a year I have no issues. It reconnects nicely if internet was lost and overall I am very happy with this product and many handy features it offers in the mobile app.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0

"I love the idea of this Wifi Garage Door opener, but it just isn't reliable.  I get a ""sensor error"" once a week.  This is frustrating because I can't tell if the door is open or shut.  Also, while it appears to be tracking when my garage door is opened, it is only 50/50 about when door is closed.  For example, if I close the garage door with my car when I leave for work, it won't register as being closed on the app.  Hopefully a software update will fix the problem.",2,1,2019-5-6,1,1,0
"This thing is not very smart at all. The only schedule you can set is for closing. And 9 out of 10 times, it will reopen within a minute of closing. It's a pain to use with google home. You actually have to tell google to talk to myQ. Then a dumb voice comes on and says the same thing every time - like you don't know what you want to say so it has to remind you. This is the absolute worst ""intelligent"" home device I own. Furthermore, it is rare that anything I buy from Amazon is myQ deliverable. Only once have I been able to use use it and the driver did deliver into my garage, but of course, the door reopened within a minute of closing. Dumb item. I researched garage openers for days, and this was supposed to be the best. Argh. Glad I paid sale price, but still, I wish I would have never bought it.",2,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0

"I don't need Alexa integration, but only a way to monitor the garage door status/notifications. The installation went smoothly, and it opens/closes the door from my phone as expect.

"I did extensive research before purchasing this product.  It was in fact recommended by a repairman working on my garage door instead of something they sold and installed.  The listing in Amazon said it was comparable with Alexa, for a $1/month charge.  The other reviews I read  on Amazon mentioned the fee and their displeasure with the companies “greed” but the Alexa compatablity was key for me so I made my purchase.  Installation was pretty easy and went off without a hitch.  The problem started when I tried to pair the hub with Alexa and could not.  After consulting Dr. Google I found out through the MyQ community chat that Chamberlain had removed the “skill” from Alexa.  I contacted Amazon help and found out that was true which made me very unhappy, especially since the listing on Amazon still said it was Alexa compatable.  Kudos to Amazon customer service for eventually making me a satisfied customer but the misleading information in the listing is the sole reason for my low rating, I would have given it a one star rating except the ease of installation and the products function gets is an extra star.",2,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
"The hardware is easy to install, first programming on the Wi-Fi is easy, if you happen to change the router from another company in the future, you may have to call MyQ to have them assist you into reprogramming it but they were very helpful and professional.It is very customizable with the setting alerts for time the door was left open, the obvious plus to this device is still alerts you and you can control from wherever you are to close the door, to open it as well. I got an email today from them alerting me that my battery level was getting low and to change the batteries. It’s been about eight months. So far very satisfied.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"I was surprised on how quick and easy set-up was. Technology is not always my friend. It alarms to let you know it's closing, which threw me off a bit because I thought I'd done something wrong.

"Was a bit of a pain to setup and still does not work 100 percent with both of my Craftsman openers.  Right now it's free to integrate with Google, but I can't see any benefit to paying for it either since google cannot directly communicate with the device.  You must ask google to ask myq to close door.  Keep in mind the doors cannot be opened thru voice.  I had some issues early on as their servers went down after primeday.",4,1,2019-8-8,1,1,0
This myQ was easy to install and works great with the app. Unfortunately their is no siri feature built in but that's no big deal. Also there is a very annoying safety feature sound when closing door and there is no option to bypass it in the settings. To eliminate that all together just remove the 2 screws on back of unit and counter sink one of the screws in the speaker hole slowly. The speaker will pop off and then cut the wire and problem solved. Overall it is a quick responsive unit.,5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
Loving this so far. Only bought this due to a great Prime Day deal.Very easy install with step-by-step instructions via the MyQ app. Was even able to link to my Nest easily.

"The only good thing I can say is it was easy to install. I followed the instructions and videos, which were excellent. However the product does not work. Distance from the garage ceiling hub to my wifi router is 9-10 ft.  Setup worked easily but ever since then it was down hill. I cannot get it to work from my phone consistently. The whole purpose of having this was to be able to control the door when away and somewhere needs to access the house. I bought 2 of these thinking it would be a great product for my daughter too.

"This is very easy to install on the door and ceiling, and I've had no issues with LED lights in the area like some reviews stated.I have noticed a delay sometimes in the unit realizing that the door has closed, and if you try to open it before it has recognized it's closed, it won't open.  This isn't usually an issue unless you forget something right when it closes then have to wait for it to catch up.",4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
Easy set up (video on the app walks you through step by step). Did have an issue come up because iOS data was interrupting the WiFi signal but after reaching out to their customer support to realize that was the issue and turning data off on my phone during set up it connected with no problem. Great way to allow access to family and friends who may be house sitting or checking on a pet while you’re away. Ability to grant guest access or you can just have them send you a quick text when they are at your house and you can grant them access from the app. MyQ has an Apple Watch app as well which works extremely well! For a similar price to a keyless entry door opener this option feels like a more secure option!,5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
So far so good.  Set up was straight forward but the Sync with the garage door itself took a while. I am not sure if the directions were just not specific enough or my configuration was off.  But after I moved the hub closer (right next to) the garage door opener and tried a few more times it finally worked.  No issues since.  Would like integration with Alexa and an alarm or alert if my door was open for too long to at a certain time but can make it work.  Just scheduled it to close every night at 12am in case I (or kids) left if open.  With the phone app I don’t need to buy more of the long lost controllers for the cars we have that do not have openers built it!  That is handy!,4,1,2019-6-7,1,1,0
"I've bought two of these now - one for an uncle and one for my gf. Both times, the install was very easy to do. I learned of these after I had upgraded my whole motor with the Chamberlain MyQ system, and was glad I did since apparently a lot of people have a hard time remembering whether or not they've closed their garage door. The only thing that I can't seem to figure out on this particular model is how to have the door automatically shut if it's been open for two long. Sadly, I think that may only be available on newer models",4,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0

"This was definitely an EASY install, literally took a couple of minutes for everything! The only issue that confuses me, is that you lose the garage sensor (the one that stops the garage from crashing down on a person or object).  I'm not so sure that this is safe around children or pets - - that frequent the garage.  At the moment, we still use it - - but we may need to find a better solution or opt to actually purchase a smart garage.Also, we haven't hooked up the Alexa functionality because we don't own any Alexa enabled security cameras - - and Amazon Key isn't available in Hawaii :(",4,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"Is not compatible with Alexa.  Why they put it in the search when I specifically asked for an ""Alexa enabled thermostat"" I cant yell you but it kind of pissed me off.  That being said, I only have one garage door, I can still use my phone to work it and I'm moving to a house with three garage doors so it will do for now.  It was easy to set up.  App is a bit limited but works fine.Just hate that it's not Alexa enabled.

"Installation was really quick and easy. I have two garage door openers, so I wanted to get a second sensor. I found it was a lot cheaper to buy a second hub (which includes a sensor) from an Amazon Warehouse deal, than it would have been to buy the sensor by itself. Now I have some spare parts in case I ever need them.Anytime I'm away from home and want to verify that I remembered to close the garage door, I can do that now.

"It was difficult to install with inadequate instructions. There wasn’t clear instructions on how to pair my opener with this hub. Works fine after installing. Does loud, unnecessary prolonged beeping while closing which initially made me think something in g was wrong. The garage open alerts work and are nice.EDIT: It recently detected garage door was open while it in fact was closed.

"Multiple reviews documented the problem with this product, though some were also positive.  I assumed that most people were not technically savvy and that explained the poor reviews.  However, after owning this product for about a month I can report that the hub is unable to detect the door sensor on a regular basis (eg, almost daily).  I have followed the setup instructions religiously, tested the sensor battery, repaired the hub and sensor.  It doesn't seem to matter what troubleshooting technique I attempt, the hub cannot detect if the door is closed when we are away, thus rendering this product useless.  Moreover, if you try to close the door remotely when the sensor is undetected, you can only do so twice without encountering an error and having to reset the entire system in the app.  The only fix seems to be to press the sensor test button, then, and only then, the hub will detect the door sensor.  Of course, one has to be home to press the sensor test button.A product whose core value is to give homeowners piece of mind when away, in fact raises more questions.  ""Is my door closed or open?""  There seems to be no way to know with this device.  Save your money.  If you want remote access and detection, spend the extra money and replace your  garage door opener with a wi-fi capable opener. This solution is simply a waste of time and money.",1,1,2018-5-2,1,1,0
"Let me start by saying I’ve been a software engineer for 17 years, both embedded software and .NET development. This was a pain in the ass to setup. First, it wouldn’t sync to my garage door motor as I tried several times, following the directions to the T. I gave up and initiated a return. Two days later as I went to take it down, I gave it one more try and got it finally connected and the door did it’s initial open. Then the next hurdle, getting the ap to actually open and close was another challenge. After several attempts and resets on the device and phone I got it working. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.

"The headline...it works.  It does exactly what it is supposed to.  It monitors, opens and closes the garage door.  There is no surprises.  However, you may have some difficultly with the programming.  I had to go through the process several times.  Any delay in the steps will make you start all over.  That is really the biggest issue I had and why I gave it four instead of five stars.  The app requires you to start over from the beginning every time instead of picking up at the last successful step.  But once you get the setup complete, the system works just fine.  I was once 300 miles away when I got a call from a neighbor that my garage was open.  If I had this in place then, I could have easily closed it right from there.",4,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0

Though the instructions for MyQ said my system is compatible with the MyQ I had some concerns because my garage system is a Lift Master and the MyQ is made by Chamberlain, the two work as said by the instructions. I have had some test runs, may be 3 or 4, with the MyQ but that is about it as far as using it. I purchase the MyQ for those days when I think I forgot or I know I forgot to shut the garage door.

The only recommendation and caution is when the app says to push the smart/learn  button on the opener, and wait for yellow light, they are talking about on the yellow light on the opener itself NOT the yellow light on the MyQ WiFi hub.

"This was a wonderful purchase.  I love the integration with the Amazon Key app to see every instance my garage door is opened or closed.  It gives me great peace of mind to know that my loved ones made it home safely.Furthermore, the mornings where I leave for work in a hurry, I no longer have to worry about whether or not I remembered to put the garage door down.  No more circling around the neighborhood to check.  With the MyQ app, it's as easy as opening the app to view my garage door status.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"The system is very easy to install the hardware, but syncing it to the app was a nightmare.  I have a Chanberlain Liftmaster so I tried to sync under those two names and Craftsman.  The app would open and close the door with all three names, but then would give me an error it could not sync.  This didn't make sense as it obviously found it and worked.  After about an hour it finally synced.  Not before I had to reset it and remove all devices previously synced, reset the MyQ box and the app.  Wasted over 30 minutes to set it up. Their tech support is only available during business hours.  Once it finally synced it worked great.  Glad I can get alerts, open and close the door from my phone and add guests.",4,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0
"The garage opener is easy to install and its configurations. I installed in less than 10 minutes and it works perfectly. I love it because I can open or close my garage door anywhere. If my dad or family go to my home, I can open it without providing them a key or the sensor to open my garage. Also, the garage opener alert with a lot of BIIP when you are closing the door to avoid accidents. I am very happy for the moment with the item and I recommend it if you want to create an automatize house and have control with your garage door (also, provide a notification if another person open or close the garage).",5,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
"Beware of Phantom Operations!!! I installed the MyQ hub two months ago and it worked perfectly...until it didn’t. Two weeks ago, it started randomly opening on its own. I called customer service and they assured me it was not a defective MyQ because they do not show any signal from the device at the time of the openings, so it must be a neighbor who somehow synced with my garage door... weird. I’ve lived in this house 5 years and have never had this happen. So I bought their excuse and said sure, let’s fix it. They walked me through a hard reset of my garage door opener that wiped its memory. I reinstalled MyQ, which was super difficult compared to the first time, and thought it was fixed...for a day. Guess what, phantom operations are back. This is so scary and not worth the risk.",1,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"I’ve been thinking of buying one of these for a while. We went out to dinner & shopping last week and we came home several hours later only to find our garage door wide open! That’s when the decision was made to stop thinking about it and buy it! I ordered this through amazon and as expected, it arrived promptly. I had a few problems setting it up so I contacted Chamberlain Support for help! Couldn’t be happier with my experience! I spoke with a gentleman named “Andre” who made the rest of the installation a piece of cake! The most surprising thing? He spoke perfect English which is the language that I’ve preferred for the last 65 years ! If you’re thinking about getting one, just buy it! You’ll be glad you did!",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"Installation went ok. I followed instructions to a tee. The grand finale was when it opened and closed the door. Since then it has accurately reported door opening and closings, but seldom works to open or close the door remotely. I have re-paired the opener but still hardly ever works. My car remotes, wall push button, and keypad all still work fine. The myQ hub just won't stay paired to the Craftsman opener.UPDATE: Chamberlin support contacted me and sent me a new hub. I've installed it and so far it's working, both for monitoring door position and for remotely operating door opener. I'll update again if that changes.",4,1,2019-5-13,1,0,1
"I'm pretty good at staying chill, but the garage door is that thing in the morning that can sometimes make me double back because, ""Did I leave the garage door open?"" is in the back of my mind. My daughter is the same way, and now neither of us ever have to worry about that again! Lots of good videos on how to install, and easy to set up. If you set up the wifi, then unplug the unit, it still remembers it all. That was my only concern when I installed it (actually unplugged it twice and it was still good). Great product - and only $30!!!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
One of our cars sits in the driveway. Due to car thefts in our area we were wary of leaving a garage door opener in the car. We ordered and installed this product without frustration! The app makes it easy to open and close.We were away from home for the day and our dog got out of the yard. Our neighbor called to let us know he was safe. I opened the garage door through the app so she could put him in the house. When she was done we used the app to close the door! We were an hour from home and it worked!,5,1,2019-2-26,1,1,0
"I installed this about two weeks ago. Was a bit hesitant about purchasing after seeing all the negative reviews. I followed the instructions and videos in the app. The units paired up and connected to my WiFi network right away. I was concerned about interference from florescent and LED lights since I have both, but it hasn't been an issue. The app opens and closes the door almost instantly and I get all the alerts I have set. The one thing I am unable to do from the app is lock and unlock the door. At night I push the ""Lock"" button on the Liftmaster controller to lock out the remote clickers and the HomeLInk remotes so if someone gets into my car they can't open the garage door. This also locks out the MyQ. I would like to see the MyQ hub work like a Keypad remote and operate the door whether or not it is locked. Or have an option to lock and unlock the controller from the app. I will check with support and see if that is possible.",4,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0

"After reading some of the (very lengthy) reviews that went into great detail about their horrible install experience, I was a little on the fence about ordering this. However, my experience could not have been better. The app does everything for you. EVERYTHING. This install is quick, fool proof and easy to follow. My only knock on this product is it’s lack of Alexa integration. But the MyQ app is great, so I don’t mind having to use it. I would recommend this to anyone regardless of how tech savvy they are.",4,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
Have had this installed for about 2 months now. Connected with no problems. iPhone app is easy to use and I have it set so it logs me in automatically.  Only issue I’ve had is trying to control the door when I’m in the zone where house WiFi is diminished and cell hasn’t quite picked up. I like the flashing light and beeper because I don’t have to wait on the door to move nor be watching it to know it is about to open/close. Was able to use this rather than purchasing a single door controller which costs more and didn’t give me the ability to get remote notifications or see the status of the door.,5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
Very easy to install and get working - the instructional videos and click-through instructions on the app make it nearly impossible to get it wrong.The door opens nearly instantly - a little delay in closing. The MyQ unit flashes a few times and starts beeping a few seconds before the motor starts closing the door. The beeping will quickly drive you insane as it starts when you hit ‘close’ on the app and continues to beep the entire time the door is moving and for some seconds after the door is closed.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
"I used the MyQ garage door opener to enable my house to become smarter and I wanted to be able to control the opening and closing of my garage from anywhere, because I have family members that often times forget to close the garage because they were in a rush.  The system works great, however, I loose my signal to the hub sometimes. It has nothing to do with MyQ.  The problem I have is because of my outdated cheap modem/router from Time Warner and my aging Samsung phone loaded with apps. I resolved it a little by placing extenders in the garage. The only other issue I had was difficulty getting it to interface with Alexa and I m still working that issue. Its reported that I need to purchase additional hardware and interfaces to get it communicating. As you can see in the posted video it working great... I was not very detailed but shared enough to let you know that the system is worth the price.  Lastly I advised to keep the garage remotes which is also compatible with the system because if your phone is in any way like mine loosing charge quickly...…..you may get locked out...lol",4,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"I was so excited to get this. I even did my homework and checked if my Gene garage door opener was compatible and it was on their list. When I received it, I read the instructions and follow it. I installed it and was following the instructions on the app. When I tried to input the hub serial number, an error messages kept coming out. I tried everything even calling Amazon help but they couldn't figure it out. So I'm returning it. So disappointed!",1,1,2018-8-6,1,2,0
"I like this product, I really do, it just feels like you are an early adapter. For the right price, when it goes on sale, it's a good product. However, it does not integrate well and I had to set mine up twice to get it to work. Once it was all setup it generally works well, but once in awhile I will be told the door is open when it is in fact closed. It was worth the price and I would not want to live without it; however, if I had to do it again I would consider spending more on another product.",3,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"Set up is very user friendly, I did not have any issues with the connection to my network. The problem I stumbled upon was setting my Alexa devices to connect with the MyQ opener. I had to connect with an app called Simple Commands. It definitely works with Alexa but will need some extra steps by using simple commands app. Another issue I have had happened to me is the MyQ app will sometimes not connect with the MyQ opener not too sure why, so I have to close the MyQ app on my iPhone and reopen for it to connect. I’ve experienced that a couple of times. Overall I’m very happy with the product. I love the warnings if you leave the garage opened. Would definitely recommend!",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"Product does work with google, but you can’t open the garage door with google.  Saying “Ok google, close my garage door” doesn’t work simply.  You must say “ok google, talk to MyQ”, the MyQ opens and it explains with a voice prompt what it can do, such as “is my door open?, or close my door”.  Then, you can say,  “close my door” and it will (usually).  After that you must go back in, same routine and ask if it’s closed, no push confirmation.  The most frustrating thing is that it can’t open your door using voice prompts, but it does give you a “I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that” response.  This means you must launch the MyQ app on your phone, go into my devices, wait for them to populate, then press the icon to open the door desired.  That would be that bad.... but the effing app logs out within 10 minutes of last use.  So, every time, you need to log in, which takes at least 30-40 seconds of spinning cursor, then, finding devices, the opening.  Support sucks, I see at least 4 comments posted on chat/forum re: lack of persistent login issue, and they all have gone unacknowledged, unanswered for months.  Even trying to register on support page navigates to blank page (although I’m on tablet, and pc ymmv).",1,1,2019-1-16,1,1,0

Called chamberlain support, who were absolutely wonderful, and we ended up pairing it by doing the pairing for a remote light instead of garage door opener.

"I read Steve's review (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGO7EDQMIMEPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075H7Z5L8) and found it more useful than the Chamberlain instructions!  Thanks, Steve.  The physical installation was easy; getting everything communicating and working together was not.  I love this low-cost alternative to make my 2 old but functional garage door openers sort of smart.  But I wish the issues that Steve addressed would be cleaned up by Chamberlain.  The other problem I had was following the instructions.  The minimal instructions in the package were less than adequate.  They expect the app to guide you through the only difficult part: getting everything communicating.  I followed the app instructions carefully until I got to the point I needed to register the hub.  But the app said that the device could not be found, and offered no help on what to do next.  After several minutes of frustration, i closed the app and restarted it.  That time I got what appeared to be an entirely different sequence of clear instructions that worked...sort of.  i got the 2 doors working and then my first door quit responding.  All I could see was the circle rotating on the app around the ""1"" door.  Since I was out of time, I manually closed the door and the app.  A couple of days ater, I tried again thinking I would need to repair the sensor but, no, everything was working together.  What was the problem and how it repaired itself are both unknown.  This is a great device with lots of potential but Chamberlain needs to cleanup the bugas and provide better instructions.",3,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"Very easy to install. I installed it on two garage doors that have Chamberlain openers though it looks like it works with most models sold after 1993 that have the safety stop sensors  by the bottom of the garage door. They work independently, you only need one hub and two door sensors if you have two doors. Sometimes we would forget to shut the doors and now I can easily check from anywhere on my phone to see if they are shut and if not close them. You can also have it send you an alert based on your time preferences if the door is open for too long etc. it’s also capable on being linked to amazon for deliveries, so they can leave packages in the garage, though I have not used this feature.",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"Works great! Reason why I gave 4 stars is because sometimes (very rarely) it sends false notifications that garage opened and closed.And installation is very simple.  It could have been explained in the quick start guide.

Anyway, I will only say that teenagers have a ""very short memory span"" (Lol), how he left the garage door open is something I'm still trying to understand to this day!Lucky for us, I had a Nest video security camera already in the garage, so I received alerts and saw via their app that the garage door was open, so I had to drive 2 hours back home to close it - let's just say I wasn't to happy!",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0

The set up was easy enough and it seems to work well for me but when my roommate tries to close a door using the app, it closes one and then opens the other door and if he then tries to close the newly opened door (which should not have opened on its own) it gives an error so that he cannot close the door remotely. I haven't used it much beyond testing but i have not yet encountered issues from my app. Unfortunately, now I do not trust it not to do the same to me and leave our door open. If you have more than one sensor or more than one person that you want to have access, this is not a good option. Other things to note, aside from it randomly opening/closing doors, if you give access to anyone else know that they have minimal access. They can open/close the door (or both depending on whatever the app decides to do) but they cannot receive notifications if a door is left open or create alarms to notify them if it is left open. It is very clearly designed for only a single person to use and is poorly adapted for multiple users.",2,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0
"I purchased this because I was tired of wondering if I remembered to close the garage after I left my house. This took a few minutes to install and setup. Works great and would recommend. Notifications work great as well. I am supposed to be able to link it to Google home but I have not been able to get this linked. If I am ever able to get it linked, this will be the perfect garage door opener. If not, still very pleased, especially for the price.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"Works Great!  Use the SimpleCommands app to create awesome Alexa routines. Please note, for some reason it takes the Alexa app 24 hours to sync with SimpleCommands to create scenes, which you can then add to routines. So you can now say ""Alexa, Good Night"" and add a scene where it'll close the garage door as well as anything else you have added to that routine.Also, MyQ was VERY EASY to install. I didn't mount the receiver to my garage ceiling, I simply zip tied it to the beams that hold the garage door opener. Works flawless!",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"This thing is inexpensive.  I expected it to be way less awesome based on the price.  Considering what it cost, I'm very happy with it.  The app experience is ""fine,"" but not as well developed as other smart home products.  But considering the frequency with which I forget to close my garage door, this is super handy.  I have an alert set to remind me when the door has been open for 5 minutes (in addition to alerting on every open).  Would strongly recommend.",4,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
I have an Android device and the app will not allow me to login. You put the username & password and click Login and it just sits and sits. I did an online chat and then later was called by Chamberlain tech support who told me that there is a known issue in the app that causes this problem on certain phones. They are working to release an update to the app for this but in the meantime said I could connect and control my device thru the mychamberlain.com website on my phone's browser. I will be returning this and repurchasing only when there is an update.,1,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"Super easy setup, the app is a breeze, I have one in two different homes and it works amazing. Very responsive as long as you have good internet and wifi signal in your garage. The mounting is very easy, once its setup you never have to do anything again outside of log in and out. I get push notifications so I always know if the door is opening or closing, I can let family and friends into the garage. Its great for dog walkers so you dont have to give anyone a key. I would buy it again, like I said I have two of these in different locations. Zero issues with multiple IP's / location with one login.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"Very easy to install. Set up was a breeze and there were no problems. We did take advantage of the “free for a limited time“ integration with IFTTT. However, the functionality we had hoped for when purchasing this product is not available. In fact, integration with IFTTT Doesn’t give you any options. The app keeps reporting “No Options Found.”  This is apparently quite a problem judging from Internet message boards.

"I bought this hub after looking at making my apartment garage ""smart"". All of the competitors seem to be at least twice the price and this seemed like a good deal especially since IFTTT and Google Assistant integrations were free ""for a limited time"" (whatever that means). Well... I should have done my research because there is no way to open a garage via Alexa, google voice, IFTTT, or any integration. You have to use the app which is a bit more cumbersome thann just saying ""Alexa open garage"". However, the good news is you can close the door with your voice. This would be a 5 star review if they could enable the open action from smart assistants by voice.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0

I got this setup and I'm a Systems Engineer but not without a bit of pain.  The Wifi adapter on this device is terrible.  I had to move the unit all the way to the end of my garage to get a decent enough signal.  I had it in the middle of the garage and it kept loosing signal.  My garage isn't that far from my home and my camera in the garage works perfectly from the middle leaving me to believe the antenna in the adapter lacks performance.  I was going to install one on my nieces garage but it's much further than mine so I'm going to look for another option.,3,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"The app CONSTANTLY confuses up & down and if it thinks the door is down & you hit the button and the door closes, the app panics and throws an error you can ONLY clear by manually operating the door locally (if that actually fixes it). If you are away from the house, well your garage is WIDE OPEN to the street because the app disables operation until you reset the error. I have a camera because I bought the stupid thing for Amazon Key (which turns out is not in my area so a complete waste for WHY I bought it in the first place) With the camera I can CLEARLY see the door is open and there's nothing I can do about it because the app locks you out.

"Let me first say that this is a great system, especially for the price that it has been selling for lately ($30). Before you buy it, you will want to make sure that your garage door is compatible.  It's very likely that it is, but if not, it might still be useful to you as a monitor (that is, telling you whether the garage door is up or down, but not letting you do anything about it remotely).  Also make sure that you have a decent wifi signal in your garage.  If you have two garage door bays in the same garage you might want to buy two of these.  Not because you're going to install two hubs, but because each of these packs comes with one hub and one door sensor, and while each hub can control two doors, the extra door sensors are generally $31-32 each, so you can get what amounts to a spare hub for less than the cost of an extra door sensor (and yes, they are fully compatible).Now, the main issue is that the system comes with a ""safety feature"" of the most obnoxious alarm beeping if you open/close the garage remotely.  If you have dogs (or frankly, if you have ears), this alarm is intolerable.  It also flashes its bright light, which is probably sufficient for most people.  If, like me, you wanted to turn off the alarm feature, you may only do so in a permanent (presumably, warranty-voiding) manner.  You will want to take a phillips head screw-driver and remove the two back screws and then you'll see a small black round case with a hole in the center.  It's got the diameter of about a nickel and maybe 1/2"" tall.  I'll let you watch some youtube videos, but the premise is to remove it and cut the interior disc wires with some small scissors or a pliers.  Don't bother with the glue method and if your plan is to disable it in such a way as to one day make it useful again, using the method that involves a small screw that you almost certainly won't have, I recommend following the setup instructions and listening to the beeping and then tell me that you'll ever want to hear that noise again.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"Short review - but full details.  Works EXACTLY as it should but the Google Assistant, the main reason I purchased it will require some additional work.1.

After searching online for troubleshooting information, the hub had to be reset to factory defaults. Then it would pair. But I've never been able to get it to pair to my Genie Intellicode opener that it claims is on the compatibility list.

The concept is quite simple, the device is essentially a remote control that can be access through an application on your phone.

"It's a similar setup to anything else added to control a garage door opener.  The hub learns the garage code the same way an external keypad or additional remote would work.  Only difference is that now this is a wifi-connected device that can be controlled by an app, to be able to trigger that same code from across the house or from the other side of the country.  The setup procedure is like many of the other IOT devices, where it provides its own wifi network, you connect your phone/app to it, then from that app, it is used to identify/connect to your actual wifi network.  Once you understand that workflow/process, it's pretty simple.  App is simple and effective, and I like the options for the alerts to be app-based, email-based, or both.Still waiting on a second sensor for our other door, out of stock at Amazon so getting it shipped directly from Chamberlain.",5,1,2018-1-19,1,1,0

I bought this opener since i connects to existing garage door opener and works from my phone. I am handicapped and in a wheel chair and my ramp is in my garage. I use this to open the garage from in the house or out in the driveway as the button to open in the house is too high and the opener in the car uses batteries that die quickly. Now I use my phone which is always charged and is always on my side. Does not matter what car I am in or where I am in the house or driveway.Installed the device but could not get it to connect to my opener. Used the call me button from Amazons website and the connected me with manufacturer within minutes. Cleared the app per instructions from the tech Barb and was able to set it up on the first go.

I also like that I can set notifications for various things: door open after a certain hour; notification that is being opened, etc - my kids often forget to close the garage when they come in at night and the app will let me know - or, when out of town I can be notified if someone opens the garage.  Also as a side benefit, due to recent break-ins of cars in my area, I had stopped keeping my standard garage door opener in a vehicle that I keep outside - now when I use that car, I can use the app to close and open the garage door safely.

"Easy install with well done, simple video tutorials.  90% of the reason I asked for this for Christmas was to simply determine if my garage door was open or closed - I don't know how many times I've been 1/2 way to work and wondered ""did I shut the garage door?"".  Now I don't have to turn around.  A secondary benefit to me is to be able to remotely open and close the door, but not sure how much I would use that given the really annoying beeping upon remote closing (remote opening doesn't have the beeping).  The integration with Google Assistant is a bit clunky, one has to ask ""Hey Google, ask MyQ if the garage door is closed"" then a different MyQ voice comes on and answers the question (sometimes). Not seamless but easy to get used to and not the primary reason I bought this.

The second thing is, you must choose your garage door motor from a list of manufacturers, but the list NEVER loads (using the app).  Again, customer service to the rescue...you can complete the installation by going to mychamberlain.com.  However, this site apparently will soon be abandoned.

"I purchased the hub + one additional sensor. I downloaded the app and used the app for setup / installation instructions. Two things I did differently: 1)  I mounted the hub on the wall opposite my doors rather than the ceiling - it did not effect performance. 2) I opened the hub and took a tiny screw and screwed it into the speaker (there's a tiny hole on top of it) - this ""disabled"" the annoying beeps that emit every time you close the door.

I took a chance - purchased it on Wednesday, got it Thursday and it took roughly 10 minutes to install. Instructions were VERY EASY to follow!! I love that the app came with a short video. The device works perfect and now I can get rid of those old remotes and not worry about sharing the last remaining ""working"" remote!! I'm able to ""invite"" 3 additional people to access the garage on their phone (with app download) which works PERFECT for my MIL to enter our home through the garage when she visits.

"This device works splendidly with my Wayne Dalton ProDrive garage door opener.  I bought a used one, and it lacked a bit in the documentation department, which was to be expected.  Normally, I can figure out most things, but I went ahead and performed the reset on the hub device (the thing with the light, which talks to your phone and wifi) and then I was able to update it, and get it all talking.  Then, I began the task of trying to pair it with the garage door--and I didn't attach it to the garage ceiling first because, well, what if I needed to hit reset, power it off, etc.  Also, I did not know that I needed the door sensor to be attached to the garage door before this pairing would successfully complete, I figured I would do that afterwards, when I was all done and then hanging everything up permanently.  You CANNOT complete the garage door opener pairing procedure without the door sensor installed on the garage door!!!  Once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing and the device works beautifully!I also installed a camera (Blink XT) in the garage facing outwards so that I can watch the garage door and verify that it does as the app says, and it hasn't failed a bit.  Also, the device has been quite resilient to power outages for over an hour--I would reset the breaker and it would eventually come back online without further intervention.",5,1,2018-10-10,1,0,0

"The installation of this went easily with the only real problem being a VPN app on my Android phone.  Once I disabled it and rebooted the phone, everything went smoothly.  I really like the fact I didn't have to hook into wires or point a laser at a mirror on the garage door.  The physical installation was very easy.I like the myQ app.  I like being able to see the status of my door from anywhere and if it is up, put it down.  I expecially like the schedule - I created a daily ""close the door"" event for bedtime and thus peace of mind.",4,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"Whatever you do, don’t buy this. I’m a really tech savvy guy connection should have been a breeze. I’ve been at this for over an hour. Now I’ve been on hold with tech support for over 30mins and still haven’t talked to anyone. The first time through, all the steps went smooth leading up to connecting to my opener. It wouldn’t connect (this list of openers it will and will not work with is really vague). So I followed the instructions for a factory reset. DONT DO THAT!!! Now nothing works. I can’t even get step one to sync.",1,1,2019-7-17,1,2,0
This was my second one. I originally bought the one that has the adapter for the opener on a treasure truck before the craziness of Covid. This one I got for the other garage door. I was skeptical because I didn't think it would work since the other door has a different motor but it was just as easy to install as the other and works perfectly. We all have those days where we can't remember if we closed our garage door. This has been so awesome to have.,5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"I got this as part of the Amazon Key bundle along with the Amazon Cloud Cam. It was easy to install when following the step by step via the MyQ app. Also, worth noting, I did not have to install it on the ceiling next to the garage door motor. Instead I decided to bolt it onto the wall closest to my Wifi router that I have in my garage because I wanted to ensure a good internet connection and easy access when I need to troubleshoot. Works well and opens/closes just fine. I didnt like that I can only close and not open the garage door with Alexa via IFTTT app. So, I opted not subscribe to the feature.",5,1,2019-4-26,1,0,1
"Added this sensor to my existing MyQ hub.  Installation and setup was very simple.  No issues whatsoever in pairing this to the hub and the hub to my NetGear Orbi router.

"I have a Linear garage door opener. Considered upgrading to a full Wi-Fi opener, but glad I didn’t. Saved a lot of money by getting this. The install took less than five minutes. The app is beautiful, with facial recognition built-in so that you can get into the app securely and quickly. I love that my Amazon packages can now be delivered in my garage. I also love that I can open my garage when I’m not at home when I have people who need to stop by and grab some thing. Also that it automatically closes at night – can’t tell you how many times our kids left that door open all night long. No longer! I highly recommend this product to anybody in the market.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"This thing is a complete mess. Instructions incomplete, help desk support horrible (They just read you the instructions) Very unreliable.

"This garage door tracker system is VERY useful.  Once you figure out how to set it up, it works like a charm.  Besides being able to open/close using your phone, it tracks how long the door is open (or closed) and can be programmed to send you notices if it meets a threshold that you set.The only potential issue-the battery that powers the door panels may run out and will not emit the signal to open (or close) leaving you stuck outside.  However, the instructions do tell you to check it every once in a while. Also, I wish that the instructions sharing access to family members are a little more clear since it is confusing,",5,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0

"Picked up this as it was a suggestion from my brother in law.  Having two garage doors, I needed an additional sensor, but because the hub/sensor kit was on sale, it was actually cheaper to buy two of those instead of a stand-a-lone sensor :)  So, now I have an spare hub, power adapter and mounting hardware.  Anyway, I think it took me all of thirty or forty five minutes to install the whole thing.  Instructions are via the APP, which is nice because it even provides little video clips along the way to help guide you.  Nice touch!  Works great and so far very  with our purchase.  Of course, have not figured out the Alexa/Dot process yet.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

Product arrived with a bit of damage on the box which was expected.  Installed and set up the unit which took about 20 minutes total and this, so far, has solved my problems.

First we bought one unit, and then after it was so easy and worked so well, we bought the adapter for our other garage door.  I highly recommend this product for ease of install, and how easily it works on everyone's smart phone!  Everyone in my house has the app so it is like each of us has our own garage door opener!

"When we recently lost our garage clicker, I decided I had enough.  FYI, we live in an apartment and have an individual garage at street level, which means that we can't access the garage any other way than opening the garage door from the street. It's annoying because you have to take the clicker in and out of the car... And then you lose it...  This thing took me about 10 minutes to instal.  Super easy to follow instructions on the app.  Works great and I like the added security feature that make the device beep and flash for a few seconds before the door closes.",5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
Great product!!  Took 30 mins to install and that’s including signing up on the app.  The instructions the app took you through were very simple and clear to follow.  Simple!  Product works great and I love that I can now see the status of my garage whether it’s open or closed through the app.  There’s been times I left the house and didn’t remember.

"This was easy to setup and works well on my garage. I wish there was Alexa voice integration, but that might be a feature they add later on. Haven't tried to setup with IFTTT yet. I do enjoy the alerts if the garage is left open and the schedule to automatically close it at certain times. My only real gripe is the alarm that goes off whenever you close the garage through the app - i would like an option to completely disable this. It beeps for 5 seconds before even initiating the command to close the garage, keeps beeping while closing, and beeps for 5 more seconds after it closed (this is annoying)",4,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0

It will not open the door for you.  The app is nice and has some good features but does not beat the good old fashioned remote. Remote takes a press of the button to open.  To use the app I would have to take out my phone, unlock it, open the app, and then press the button to open the garage door. A little time consuming for something so simple.",1,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0

"I have a good 2.4GHz WiFi signal in my garage, and the installation process was nearly effortless. Works like a champ.One silly bit of behavior from the iOS app: it apparently doesn’t understand that time is a continuous cycle of hours -  so setting an Alert when garage door is opened from 11pm-6am fails because the end time of the alert must be later than the start time. Fixed by setting an alert from 11p-11:59p, then one from 12a-6a, but it’s silly to have to work around that and shows a sloppy approach to the design and testing. Thus, I deducted one star.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
I paired this with a chamberlain garage door after i got frustrated with my kids leaving the garage door open. This works with amazon lock and amazon deliveries now come inside the garage. Take time to install after watching the video from chamberlain. The phone app is very easy to use. Now you can be relieved if you are on the road and dont know if you left the garage door open. Amazon deliveries are safely delivered in your garage(with amazon lock). Get a $30 credit from amazon towards the price of this opener.,5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,1
"I got this as a backup remote, as sometimes when I walk, my outside keypad has trouble opening the door, and I wanted remote access to the door for helping family or others I don't want to set a code for.I was a fairly easy DIY install. I don't know why the included instructions don't give ALL the steps! They get you to the app and then the app guides you through the hardware install. But it wasn't that difficult and my garage is on the other side of the wall where the Wi-Fi router is. (This is important as you do need a strong signal.) The LOUD BEEPING can be annoying but is a SAFETY FEATURE! Since you can open, or more importantly, CLOSE the door from anywhere someone could be in the wrong place. The sound doesn't last that long and certainly isn't a reason to return this device!",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"I bought this as an alternative to getting off my motorcycle and manually inputting the code every time I ride it. Unfortunately, every time you open the app it forces you to input your FULL password! It allows for Face ID but that defeats the purpose of the product (making it easier to open my garage) if I have to take off my helmet the second I pull in my driveway. To my knowledge there isn’t an option to set up a 4 digit pin or anything like that either.. So for now it’s, pull in the driveway, put in full password, open garage door; or pull in driveway, remove helmet, Face ID, open garage door; or just get off the bike and manually input the code to open it as I did before. From what I understand I can buy the Apple “Home Bridge Kit” which will allow me to bypass the app altogether and set up geofencing so that my garage door just opens when I get within a preset distance from my house. At this time it looks like that’s my next step because this product alone didn’t solve anything for me really.. Other than being able to squash that sinking feeling of dread I get when I can’t remember if I closed the garage when I left my house. If you want it for that reason, it’s great. If you want it for making your life easier save yourself the headache and buy the “Home bridge kit” at the same time so you can have all the great features that come with home kit.",3,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0

You can have Amazon Deliver packages by opening your Garage. So they should have all the  information they need to create a MyQ Skill for Alexa in partnership with Chamberlain Group.

"With 5 vehicles and 3 drivers, there never seems to be enough garage door openers to go around.  So this was an easy solution to spending a ton of cash on more clickers than we really needed, just to put one in/on each vehicle (3 cars, 2 motorcycles).  It was very easy to install, and works as advertised.  Without the loud, obnoxious beeping and lights flashing whenever you close the door with the app, it would be a 5-star rating.  I also value my family's safety, and having the app on a phone that only we have access to is safer in my opinion than a clicker.  Think about it:  If you have a clicker or use HomeLink as an accessory on your vehicle and your car were to get stolen, now the thief has not only your car, but your address (from your registration) and a way to access your home through the garage.  Ideally only you and those you trust most can access your cell phone, so your garage door is no longer a portal to all your belongings.",4,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0

"The opener is easy to set up, and works reliably enough, but the dealbreaker for me is- in a product advertising its Amazon Key capability- that it has zero integration with Alexa, and that's by design as the manufacturer intentionally removed the skill for integrating with it.

He spent over half an hour working on it.  He finally advised the instructions were incorrect and, he used instructions for Android phones instead.

"I bought this system with additional door sensor to control my two garage doors with my nest secure system hoping it would integrate into my home security system since it advertises that it ""works with nest"" the truth is in the myq app you can set home or away settings in your nest system but you can't access the control of the garage doors with nest and it won't trigger your alarm if someone opens a garage door when your nest secure alarm is armed, best you can do is get a notification to your phone that the garage door has been opened if your nest is set to away. so when I'm home at night if someone were to show up and manage to open my garage door it won't notify me. This product does seem to work good so far I just wish the product had been more clear when advertising that it works with nest but I never found any details claiming it wouldn't integrate into my next app. Hopefully nest will release something like this that works in their ecosystem soon.",1,1,2018-8-24,1,2,0

I was able to open/close my garage door in less than 10 minutes.  It took another 10 to mount the hub.  Though it has only been a week, I'm very pleased with this product.  I have not (don't plan to) integrate with Alexa.  However, I may search IFTTT for integrations with other devices in my home (lighting, camera, etc).  I would certainly recommend this product to friends, family and other Amazon shoppers!",5,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
Awesome product.  Had car get broken into several times.  Of course theives stole remote and got into garage.  This solves my security issue as car(s) no longer have remote in car.  Have app on my phone that alerts me when door open or closed.  I am able to open door from outside house no extra keypad.  It took only a few minutes to install and setup.  Highly recommend to increase security at house.,5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"I didn't see it anywhere other than the box (after it arrived, and not very prominent), not on this page or in the instructions, but iOS 10 or higher is required.  Shame.

"If you’re trying to change the Wi-Fi network on your Chamberlain hub, you press and hold the settings button to get a blinking blue light on the hub. If you press and release the button normally/quickly you will get a flashing blue light as described, but you won’t be able to change the Wi-Fi. You really do have to press and HOLD UNTIL the blue light blinks. Also this door opener has a super annoying warning beep/alarm that goes off when you use it. This is required by law for 5 seconds, but this alarm goes on much longer (20 seconds or more).",3,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
Hi.I was initially very impressed with the way things worked. It was reasonably easy to install and put it. Worked fine for a month. Then suddenly the app did not have any information on my device and I had to basically redo the whole setup process!!,1,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
"Work as advertised, installation instruction can be better but using common sense it can be install without any instructions.  I have 2 of them in 2 different houses both works fine.

After about 2 months of use with the MyQ-G030 Garage Door Opener for my Chamberlain overhead door I am very pleased.  Installation was a breeze and I found the included instructions to be spot-on.  I only use the MyQ system with my android smart phone application and have not found it necessary to incorporate either an Alexa or Google voice control system.  This keeps it simple and dependable without paying any monthly or annual fee(s) to Chamberlain. Highly recommended especially if you exclusively use a smartphone application for usage.,5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"I love my MyQ garage opener! I have been able to allow people into my home without being there and without having to give a code to the front door! Also I have a screen door that I often lock so there's no access to my front door to access the code! In these instances I can open my garage door remotely if someone needs entry into my home! For example, my son when he leaves his keys in his room and no one is home when he returns from school!",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
This product is good in that it can remotely open and close your garage door with your phone. BUT be warned that it DOES NOT link to your google home. It does link to your google assist but you have to tell google assist to talk to myQ before any commands work. This the worst interface ever. Very disappointing that it can't just be directly linked like every other smart product. Hopefully they change that or update it soon. Till then I would save my money and get something else.,3,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I purchased this unit to add smart features to my existing Genie garage door opener.  It performs that function quite well.  The big drawback is there is only one way to control without paying an extra fee and that is through the MyQ app.  The unit also doesn't integrate with Alexa at all (although it is compatible with Amazon Key).  None of this is a deal breaker as it performs its core function well and was easy to install and setup.  For the price I paid on Prime Day, I am quite pleased with the unit.  Just be aware of the shortcomings.",3,1,2019-7-24,1,0,1

I was alerted about this item from an Amazon Truck deal. After purchasing I read several reviews about this product but felt unsure of the person who I bought the garage door opener for would like it. They did like the gift but the new garage door that they currently have already has a similar device installed already since it's a newer model door. I gave three stars for this product in hopes that my review would be deemed neutral. The return was easy although I had to contact Amazon about my refund.,3,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
I purchased two MyQ Hubs and two additional sensors for my parents 4 garage doors.  I'm very surprised at how easy this was to setup once I got the first garage door opener to pair w/ the hub. I set a schedule for them to close @ 6pm every day so my elderly parents wouldn't have to go outside @ night to close them. It works perfectly. You can even set an email notification when they close. Very pleased with this purchase. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.,5,1,2018-12-13,1,1,0
"Been using this product for years. When this went on sale, I bought a couple as Christmas gifts. Gave one to a fiend of mine last Christmas and he was very thankful for it. He and his family have been using it since. We both love the convenience of having the ability to check your garage door status. Now there’s no need for me to come back home whether I have doubt if I’ve closed the garage door or not. So many countless times I had to turn around and see whether I closed the garage door or not. I recommend for people to have this device.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0

"The physical installation is simple and I had no issues with the initial application install or wifi setup. What did turn into a problem was the Chamberlain MyQ would not connect with my Chamberlain Garage Opener. No errors, no diagnostics, no way to troubleshoot, and on a Sunday afternoon, no tech support. I left it overnight and, prior to calling tech support, started from the top. The app was smart enough to identify I had already done the wifi, and when it came time to pair, it worked first time.But - it won't directly integrate with Google home. The integration with Google Assistant is like invoking an Alexa skill and is very limited. It's best just to stay inside the native app on the phone. If I can turn off/down/shorten the ""closing beeper"" I can't find it. If I can rename the ""Garage Door Opener"" to ""Garage Door"" to shorten the command, I can't find it. Trying to find useful support articles on the website is difficult. While Google returns related items, when you arrive at myQ Support, you never get the ""discussion"", just the general help. Be aware that a ""subscription"" is required to integrate with Google, etc., though at present the fee is waived.",3,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"I bought this on Amazon Prime Day.  We have been converting our home to be a smart home and this was one area that needed attention.  It was easy to install and works as it should.  I did have to use IFTTT to integrate with Alexa.  If there was a Alexa skill, I could not find it. I think the company needs to address this.  Because closing the garage door is something I don't give direct attention,  I occasionally find myself on my way to the gym and can't remember if I closed the garage door. In the past , I would turn around and go back home to check.  Now I can just pull up the app on my phone and assure myself that I did indeed close the door!",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"This product is great. I really didn't purchase it to replace the remotes or the button on the wall in the garage. It's more of a piece of mind that I know the garage is shut as I occasionally will forget to close it when I leave. If I want to let a visiting family member in the house that doesn't already have a key, I can easily do it as I haven't got around to purchasing a smart door lock yet. I user it with my Google Hub, so it does integrate with Google. I do recommend the product.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
This is a great feature and addition to any garage door. This hub allows you to control your garage door opener from anywhere on planet earth. Crazy right?The other crazy thing is it just randomly opens the door whenever it feels like getting fresh air. Not cool.

"I bought the MyQ hub to use with my 3yr old Liftmaster garage opener. Installation went well. No problems. Instructions were pretty clear and the install videos in app helped as well. Very smooth install and the MyQ app worked great for opening closing via phone, and notifications when it opens or closes. Also I like the scheduler (although I haven't tested that part yet).Several complaints though. One the closing siren is a bit loud. I know it is a safety thing, but honestly my garage door isn't exactly quiet. The door alone is probably noisy enough to warn people.",3,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
"If you have teenagers, or others, who leave the house and forget to close the garage door this is the solution for you.  I searched other comparable products and chose this one.  The most effort to installing this product is mounting the hub to your garage ceiling.  The install instructions are clear and easy to follow.  If you follow the included instructions the integration and setup are super easy.  I love the ""open door"" alerts on my phone and set mine for 10 minutes.  I also scheduled it to automatically close at two times of night for when my daughters come home late and forget to close the garage door.",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

"At a little under 4 months, this product began sending false alerts stating the garage door was left open when it was in fact, closed. Following all of the FAQ's, I checked the door sensors which work fine, and deleted then re-installed the app as well as installed a new battery in the door sensor. None of this took care of the issue which has continued for several weeks. I contacted the seller through the support link on Amazon weeks ago with no response.  Since the unit continues to send out false alerts, it cannot be trusted with the security of my home.  Another unit purchased as a gift has been flawless, as was this one for several month before the issues started. I cannot recommend this to anyone based on the lack of response to support requests by the company, as there is no option for exchanging the unit when they don't reply to requests for service.",1,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0

The problems started with installation.  I have over 20 WIFI connected items in my house and never an issue with installation.  But the installation and setup required a call to the Support desk.  I got a very helpful rep and we got it working.  Then it was hit or miss if the device worked.  I called Support and followed all the suggestions.  At one point they told me to replace the battery in the door sensor even though it was a brand new device.  They blamed Amazon for repackaging old devices.

And now i no longer need to turn around to see if I had closed the garage, all I have to do is open my app, and check.

I installed this in my garage with a 1975 Craftsman garage door opener (green setup button) and this is superb. So many times I have to turn back home to check or close the garage door. I installed a small cam inside the garage so I could see if the doors were open or closed. But even if one was left open I still had to turn around and go home to close it.

The place they put this instruction led me to believe that I needed to do the test as part of the setup process. So it fails and off to target I go to get this odd shape battery.

I installed the unit next to the door opener and plugged it in.  pulled up the app and walked through the instructions to set it all up.  I then programmed it to my door opener and gave it a test and it worked like a champ.  I was back in th house by 10:15.  Easy Peasy.  I decided NOT to set it to Alexa however since, ANYONE can tell Alexa to open the garage door.

Great addition to a smart house. Have always been concerned about if the garage was closed and this product gives me that reassurance plus more. Did really think I would use the WiFi open/close feature much but with the Apple Watch app I find I use it all the time and my exterior keypad is no longer used. Great product and easy to install.

Also, the sensor requires a battery with is very annoying to think that I'd have to replace it. The sensor also uses adhesive strip to mount on the garage door... Terrible way to mount something.

Other than that, it was very simple and it functions very well. I use the app on my Apple Watch to control it. It responds fast and is extremely convent.

"I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but I really needed something for our second home so that I can open and close the garage remotely when our trash pick up service comes to collect our garbage from inside the garage. The set up was very easy; I just installed the app and followed the instructions. It took me about 30 minutes to set up by myself. The only issue: the anchors for the screws that are supposed to attach the unit to the wall via a bracket were pretty cheap and didn't hold up. They collapsed when I tried to insert them into the hole I drilled in the drywall. Luckily, the unit it is supposed to hold is very light, so the screws themselves were strong enough to hold the bracket that houses the unit. After installation, everything worked as expected. My old garage opener still works with this installed, and now I can control the garage door with my phone, and I can tell the status of the door at any time.

"Bought this MyQ Hub so I could remotely check to make sure my garage door was closed (my kids are hit/miss on closing it when they leave).  Also, being able to open it from wherever I am in case I need to let someone in, like a neighbor to let the dogs out, is a big plus.  Plus it works like just another garage door opener remote that is always in my pocket.  The app works great, easy download and configuration, no bugs or crashes, and there are numerous security features for when a username and password is required that can be toggled on and off depending on your needs.  Installation was relatively easy and works fine with my Genie garage door opener.  The part where you link the hub to your home wifi isn't foolproof, but I figured it out without having to call tech support (hint: when I connected my cell phone to the MyQ hub so I could configure it with my home wifi I had to click on the configure router link in the app rather than going to the web link in the instructions).  Very happy with it to the point I'm getting one for my parents for Christmas.",5,1,2017-11-20,1,3,0
"I spent about 4 hours installing. I installed the MyQ hub and sensors on two garage doors. This part of installation was very simple. However, had difficulty in getting garage doors to open and close from MyQ phone app. Eventually, had to call service support. The service rep was great, however, it took several hours to resolve. The fix was SIMPLE. Double tap on the garage door icon in the MyQ app. Apparently, since I installed two sensors (one on each door) a single tap only confused the MyQ app, and it appeared to try and open/close the doors, but nothing happened. Again, the fix was simple. just double tap the garage door icon in the MyQ app (installed on an android device).I would have rated this product a 5 star. However, I spent many hours in an attempt to get my garage doors to open and close from the MyQ app. Other than that, great product! Service was also great!",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

The problems are inconsistent: sometimes it won't display the proper position of the door, sometimes it won't sync to the garage opener, it will never allow both sensors to be installed and working. Most of my home is ""smart"" and I work on computers so this isn't a case of ""operator error.""

Not a difficult installation but you might need to repeat a few parts of the setup multiple times before it takes. I also had to reprogram the Homelink in one of my cars after this was paired to my garage door opener. I have no idea if this was a glitch with the MyQ or the opener but it's something to look out for.Once it's installed it works great. It's not quite the perfect and complete integration as I've got with the Chamberlain garage door opener that has MyQ built in but the differences are really minor and nothing worth passing this up for.,5,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0

We could hardly get our old automatic garage opener to work unless you got out of your vehicle and stood next to the garage in a certain spot and clicked the button.

I worried about our WiFi reaching the garage, and did have to move our router to the middle of the house instead of the front.

I've linked many brands of things to my Google stuff before and I've never had as difficult a time. In the end I've learned you can't just say ""OK Google, Open the garage door"". You have to say ""Ok Google, talk to MyQ."" Then it connects to MyQ and another voice asks you if you want to know if your garage door is closed or if you want to close a door. It doesn't have an option to open the door. It's clunky and it's much easier/quicker to open the app and press the button to open. I was hoping for hands free operation.",2,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"When this HUB works its fantastic, easy to use and set-up.  The problem is the sensor loses pairing or errors and has to be re-sync'd, for me this has been consistently every 5-6weeks.  The last time I had to completely uninstall app/info and re-install as it would just no longer read my opener.  When it errors and the app remote doesn't work it at least shows the current status of the door so I can see if its open or shut away from home, but there has been no consistency in function.  I did leave it on since it's been purchased and can no longer be returned, but ended up getting a stand alone remote and use HUB only for ""monitoring."" unfortunately would not recommend",3,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
The gateway doesn’t tell you that you can buy a second sensor until you are going through the setup process. I bought this and returned a second gateway I bought.

"The myQ garage door unit is easy to set up and install. So far, it works as advertised. It's a convenience. But the price for a second (add-on) door sensor (basically a tilt switch with a radio link to the hub) is 73% of the cost of the entire system (hub plus 1 door sensor).  When I installed the unit, the Chanberlain subscription cost to permit myQ to work with Google Assistant was zero for the first year of use with no comment on whether that's a 1-year come-on or a no-cost, long-term deal.

As long as your model is on their list of approved, no idea how people have trouble with this. Even someone who isnt tech savvy should be able to pull this off. Instructions couldn't be easier or clearer with the provided videos. WIFI connection is crucial, so if your signal is weak, consider a range extender.

I understand its purpose, but it is waaaaay tooo loud and piercing.  also no way in the software to lower volume or disable the beep, so I took it apart and put a screw in the speaker and tightened it till the noise is much lower.  this worked.  Also I set up the Amazon key app, and it works fine for me, but the Amazon delivery person cannot open the door like they are supposed to.

It beeped like crazy, a safety feature, for about 40 seconds then it finally closed. That beeping is terribly annoying and cant be disabled.

It waited about 10 seconds then started to move. Then I tried to close again and it beeped like crazy again, timed out 3 times, and then wouldnt respond anymore until I operated the door manually.

Installation wasn't difficult - I put the base unit within a good wifi signal (used a phone app to measure), and it's only about 6 - 8 feet from the two sensors.  I have two thoughts about this product.First, every time I open the app to open my garage door from the house before I walk out to the garage, the app goes through a log-on cycle.  I've saved my password, so it happens on its own, but it takes a good 5 seconds to connect (I assume to Chamberlain's servers).  Sometimes it fails to connect, so instead of being able to just open the app and open my door, I have to wait 5 - 15 seconds for the thing to log on before I can hit the button.

I erased all mu codes... ugh... went back reviewed instructions again and got a better ladder so I could see the lights... after that everything worked as advertised.  It gives you piece of mind that I can see what position my door is in and if necessary close it.  It has been working flawlessly for the last few weeks.  I would recommend it if you garage door opener is compatible.",5,1,2018-6-20,1,0,0
"This was much easier to install than expected.  It needs strong internet, so I put a wifi extender in the garage.  Basically you just plug in the unit, connect to internet, pair sensor, then pair with the opener the same as you'd pair a new remote.  Our opener is a 20 year old Genie and it worked fine.  Install the bracket on the wall, hang the unit, and you're done!  Very easy step-by-step instructions on the phone app.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I installed this today on my Liftmaster 8355 door opener. Other than taking longer than it should have (due to my mistake in pressing and HOLDing the Learn button during setup), it was easy.It was only $30 so heck... you can't go too wrong. Now, I'm going to see if I can just add a 2nd door sensor to be able to control the 2nd door. If not, I'll go ahead and spend another $30.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

The unit was not easy to link to my garage opener but after 20 mins it did. It works for most of the time but it send false alerts to my phone very often.  I have it set to 5 min and it sends me wrong alerts almost every day. I had to turn around so many times to come back and check the garage door. The app shows wrong status of the door.I have not had a chance to troubleshoot / reset the unit yet but I would expect the product not to malfunction like this. Imagine you get a false alert when you are away for a important appointment !! If it malfunctions then how would you trust the status even after you reset !,1,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"The reason I bought this was because we were often unsure if we closed the garage door or not. It only takes a quick peek to know for sure now.It took me 30 minutes to install; a quick check for internet signal strength, and couple screws in the garage ceiling. It was pretty easy. You just follow the step by step instructions from your phone after downloading the app - you are simply walked through the setup.  It can do a lot more than what I need (and didn't bother to configure) because these ""extra smarts"" appeared confusing. Otherwise, I'd have given it 5 stars.",4,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0

I thought I need a WiFi extended to install this. (Since my phone gets really limited signal at my garage. ) But actually I don’t . It has better antennae than your phone. (Mine is iPhone XS Max ) so I think if you got signal in your garage on your phone but no network or very slow. It still could work for you.

Bought this in case we forget to close the garage door and be able to close it remotely. First unit was defective and would not connect to my internet network. Called amazon and was sent a replacement unit. Installed everything exactly as the app suggested and everything connected fine.I am able to see if my garage is open or closed but the unit will not signal the door to close or open at all. The light on the hub flashed and we hear a peep for the worning that the door will close and then nothing happens. After few trials the app will give me an error message. I installed a camera on the garage to tell me of the door is open it closed. So this device is useless since so far it is only good for monitoring and sometimes It is lot even accurate. Waste of money.,1,1,2018-12-2,1,1,0
"I just took delivery of this item and installed in right away. Installation was very simple and took less than 30 minutes (including pairing with both garage door opener and door sensor, and physical installation). There was no installation physical instruction manual in the box, but the iPhone app had complete instructions from pairing to the physical installation (it even had a video on the app). Once paired with the sensor and garage door opener (I have a Chamberlain garage door opener), the hub worked flawless.Some reviews complain about the warning noise that the hub makes when closing the garage door, but I don't feel that is really an issue. It will make the warning noise only when you are using the hub to close the garage door. If you are using your remote or wall switch, the hub will not be making the warning noise. I will be using the hub mostly for security and notification purposes, and will be using my wall switch to close the garage door.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

I terminated my Wink and switched to SmartThings. SmartThings does not support MqQ so it no longer integrates with Alexa. Unfortunate, so I can only use the MyQ phone app.The package includes one sensor however if you have an additional garage door you can buy an additional sensor and have the hub control that as well which is pretty cool.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0

I can see the status of the door (sometimes I'd drive away and after a few miles think, ""did I close that door!?"". Now I can be sure, and if I've forgotten, I can close it from wherever I am! And I know if for some reason the keypad fails again, the dog walker can call or text me and I can open it for her. This has been a great purchase so far!",5,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0
Really good inexpensive solution to garage door automation. I wanted to install a 2GiG solution but was not compatible with my operator. This solution was super easy to install and it works. I’m a bit disappointed there’s not an Alexa skill available but I do love the fact that we can check if we left doors open or not remotely. BTW - some reviewers mention MyQ charging a monthly subscription fee for this device and I did not find this to be the case.,5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
Randomly won't work.  Have to toggle my WiFi.  I put a dedicated WiFi extender in the garage for this device.  When I leave home I often have to turn off WiFi on my phone to get it to work.  That seemed to do the trick for several months but recently after some updates the app on my phone doesn't work consistently.  Power cycled the controller and that seemed to help but that's impractical when you want to rely on it.,3,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
I now have peace of mind that I closed my garage door.  I backed down my street EVERY morning to recheck closure because I couldn't remember if I shut the door.  My neighbors probably think I have major OCD.  Love the convenience.  Just remember to get cord out of chain's way when you program.  I wasn't watching and when I initiated the program the door activated a caught the dangling powe cord and ripped the brand new cord in half.  Called the company immediately and they shipped me a new cord for free.  It was a total error on my part but I did it right the second time and it works like a dream.,5,1,2018-4-4,1,1,0
"Fine so far. Haven't experienced connectivity issues others mentioned. Connected to my router, the garage door transmitter and my garage door opener just fine. App is OK. And none of that matters if it doesn't work with Alexa.It's cool to check to make sure I closed the door when I get to work and can't remember if I did or not. Other than that, it's a pretty useless product. Certainly not smart. Would not buy again.",2,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
It actually works occasionally. I programmed a garage door close for 9:30 PM everyday as I have forgotten to manually close it. Tonight again I got a message to check the door. I closed it earlier but I found that it had opened the door. This has happened several times before. The sensor on the garage door will loses sync with the control module. I press the reset button and the control module beeps as it should but that is only good for a day or two.,2,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"What a great concept but does it always work? no! We locked ourselves out of home twice already, we moved the sensor and had better luck but now the battery on it has to be replaced every month.

The MyQ smart garage is easy to install. The smart phone app is even easier. Just make sure your wifi extends to your garage prior to purchase. I am very happy with the product. I have been using it for about a week now. I have not hooked it up to Alexa due to not seeing the point of asking her to ask MYQ to check the garage doors instead of just looking at the app on my phone.,5,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0

There was no one else around and I didn't do it so, I chalked it up as a one time deal. Today, out of the blue it did it again. The only time it beeps is when Amazon opens it for a delivery.

"It took me less than 10 minutes to have everything running perfectly, very easy to install. So far works perfectly, the downside is that it requires a subscription fee of $1.00 dollar a month to integrate it with a third party like Google Home, Google Assistant or IFTTT.

"I had big dreams of pulling up to my garage door and having it open for me automatically, of asking Google to ""open the garage door"", or having Google open it and close it as part of my programmed routines. Almost none of that works the way you think though.First you have to route everything through Chamberlain's own servers which barely integrate with any other services. Then, when you finally do it turns out that opening the garage door is only available through their app. That's right, you cannot automate opening the garage door in any way, you can only close it when integrating through a third party.",2,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
I haven't integrated with Alexa yet but installation was easy and works 99% of the time. There are a few instances where the sensors wern't right and seems like the garage is open when it's not.

Overall works great for the intended use.,5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"I don’t understand all the posts about installation problems. From the time I open the box, it literally took me 15 minutes to get the product installed.

How it works in a long-term is yet to be determined, but so far this was a piece a cake.",5,1,2019-7-18,1,1,0
"First, this item requires a reset (of its internet connectivity) much more than other smart devices. (I have about a 1/2 dozen others.)

The app is super easy to use and the fact that it integrates with the Key app and lets Amazon deliver packages into my garage where they’re safer than the front porch makes this all the better. By the way, you can also add a camera to the setup to watch who is opening and closing the garage door via a camera that works with the Key app or the MyQ app. Definitely worth the money!",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
Works great once you get it setup/programmed. Install is easy for the hardware. It took me numerous tries to get it to kinda work with my Genie opener (book says it will work) so I switched it to my other door with a Sears opener and it works great. Love it telling me how long it’s been open or closed. Also handy to remotely close if you drive off and forget to close it.,5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
"Ok so the setup is a little involved, but if people would just stop being so impatient and read the instructions, they would get this set up just fine. All the instructions are step-by-step in the app that you register your device on, just READ THEM, people. Once it is set up properly, it works like a charm. You can get on your app when away from your home and see that the door is closed.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I was worried about connecting it to Work so that I could control it from their app. But I never got round to connecting it, because the MyQ never worked.After connecting the hub to my home network and testing the door sensor, I tried to pair my Precision PDS 4700e garage door opener to the hub. In about 10 attempts, the MyQ android app said I was successful once, and even then the door would not open or close.",1,1,2018-7-16,1,1,0
"I got this as a Lightning deal in December. Installation was really easy, and it went in without a hitch. I would like to have it linked to Amazon’s Key app, but apparently, it isn’t available in my area. Hopefully, it will be available soon. It would be nice to have my packages delivered right into my garage. I like the fact that I get an alert anytime the door is opened. This was a nice inexpensive way to move more towards having a smart house.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"Comes with no installation instructions; those are all available online after you sign up for their cloud account.  But how does somebody know they even really want to install this until they've reviewed how it gets hooked up?  App is free, but useless until you sign up for their cloud account.  WHAT IF I DON'T WANT STRANGERS HAVING ACCESS TO MY LOCAL WIFI???  Who with half a clue about security would put something like this on their network?  I would only install something this if I set up a separate wifi network just for these kinds of cloud devices.  What a pain.  The old way was better - such devices contained their own http servers and smtp clients, they sent you emails, and for greater control you could optionally forward ports to them in your firewall.  NO CLOUD REQUIRED.  Not sure what I'll do with this cloudsourced thing.  I guess I'll throw it in the trash.",1,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"It functions as promised, big hurray. However it is only for one Amazon user, no family accounts, and I could do without probably mandatory delays with beeps and lights before the garage door closes.At a bare minimum there should be a way to mute and or reduce it from the app.",3,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"Great way to get phone control of your garage door, I just wish that it would connect to the google home assistant or Alexa easier. It’s advertised as such but I couldn't get it to work with either. The amazon key works somehow though, surprise. Installation is super easy, just make sure you have strong wifi signal and pre-download the app.The app to control the door itself is a bit slow (30-45sec) to sync to load but works well once loaded.",4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"If you are looking for a remote garage door opener, it will do exactly what you expect. Easy to install and the price is right. When you close the door however, the hub emits a loud repetitive beep that continues even after the door is closed. A little obnoxious. I understand it is for safety purposes, but we already have laser sensors that will stop the door from crushing someone, so would be nice to have an option to turn the alert off. Would have been nice to have AppleHomeKit integration built in; instead you have to buy an additional peripheral to enable this feature. Seems there is no excuse to not have this included in base product. All in all it’s cheap enough to still make it worth buying.",4,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"Great product!  Works perfectly!  Easy to install!  Instructions say mount Wi-Fi / Strobe unit on the ceiling 4-5’ from opener but I mounted mine 9.5’ away on the back wall so I didn’t have to climb a ladder to reach our ceiling, which is 16 feet up.  The unit worked perfectly despite mounting it farther away.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,1,0
"Confused how this solution gets 4 stars from more than 12k reviews.  The system works as advertised with the boundarys stated in the set up.  The MyQ app allows remote opening and closing although the audible alarm when the door closes is a bit annoying. Only having the ability to add 3 guests makes it difficult for the family unless everyone uses the same account.The device does not really work with google assistant and cannot be added to google home at all.  When you finally get MyQ linked to google assistant after you ""purchase"" the free subscription.  you can only close and get the status of the door.  The door cannot be opened with google assistant.  If Chamberlain ever start charging to link with google again I'm out.",3,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
It is an excellent product. The instructions are clear enough and the setup was easy.It does what I need it to do: open my garage from a remote location.,4,1,2018-12-8,1,0,0
"This installed without any difficulty and works really well. It paired with my WiFi and garage door opener on the first tries. You have to go online to get full instructions but it is a simple process and the videos are helpful.Initially, it worked well. Then after a couple of months it would randomly report the door as open when it was closed. The problem went away after an update. I added a second detector for my other garage door and they have both been working great for several months.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"This was a good purchase, although the remote control function is not 100% reliable. The alert when the door is open and the status of the door seems spot on.  I tied to integrate with Alexa but it didn't work very easily. I might try again but it wasn't simple and I wasn't to concerned about that. I really like the technology of it and the only thing that I wish was better is that the door would always go up or down from the app. It does work about 85% of the time...",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"When it arrived, I initially thought I had to connect it to an existing remote. Thank goodness no. All that's needed is an existing wifi system and a garage opener already installed.The system took 15 minutes to install and worked as advertises, right from my cell phone. No need to worry about connecting my cars to garage door openers or buying a new garage door opener.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"It is very easy to install. I really like the ability to control the garage door with my cell phone. It makes my evening walk to the park much easier.I do have a major complaint and are considering returning the product. The door sensor only sense correctly about 80% of the time!  One of the reasons of getting this hub is to ensure we close the garage door securely.  I was able to set an alarm to notify me if the door stays open after a certain amount of time.  Well, we got these alerts so many times they are being ignored.  I have send email to tech support but received no response back yet.  Anybody has similar experiences?",2,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"The instructions and setup were very simple to install the MyQ.  This is a great addition to any smart home setup.  There is an integration for SmartThings and the setup was easy to follow to setup the device in the SmartThings manager.  If using smarthings, I would recommend to add an additional zwave sensor to the door to allow for SmartThings to see if the door is open or closed.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"What a complete piece of junk and waste of time. Was on the phone for over an hour with technical support. This thing would not connect to my Wi-Fi. Even after I made sure it was on the correct bandwidth, it still wouldn't connect. Then while I was on the phone with technical support, my login for the app wouldn't work. Even after resetting the password it still said wrong credentials. Yet I could log into their website with the same credentials just fine. Absolute garbage. Waste of my Saturday morning!",1,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I watched a quick video for a few tips beforehand. It only took me 5-10 minutes to actually mount the hub to the ceiling and Velcro the door sensor to the door with the provided VelcroAfter the physical installation was done, just downloaded the app and followed the prompts and it was all set up and ready to go on the first try.",5,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0
"I have two car garage and mostly instead of closing the one , kids will open the other without looking at the door as a result we will have both garage door open. Many times we left the both door open throughout the day or night. This product has solved that problem by alerting me on my smart phone.It works as mentioned and the app is also easy to use. Setup instructions were missing in the box however it was easy to find the video on YouTube.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"I like the idea of having an app rather than a physical device to open my garage so I thought i would try this out. In the past month, I've been locked out of my house twice because the app didn't load. It also is supposed to keep you signed in but it doesn't always so in order to get back in you have to log in again. I also had a power outage and it took over an hour before it came back online so I could open my door.",2,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"This was installed in under 30 minutes. It was easy to do by myself and easy to connect to my iPhone. I use to worry about whether I closed my garage door, especially in the morning when things get so hectic trying to get everyone out the door, but now I can just check my phone to make sure everything is closed. It especially came in handy when I was in a rental car and did not have my garage door opener, but I was still able to park in the garage like I normally would. The only drawback is no connection to Google Assistant, but I guess it is compatible with Alexa (which we do not use). Will be purchasing a second unit for the other garage door!",5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"If you have a two-door garage, you need to add only this door sensor to the second door to control it automatically (if the first door already has a Chamberlain MyQ hub). Each door needs its own sensor, and both sensors can share one hub. The sensors are wireless, and very easy to install and operate. Great product, great product support, highly recommended.",5,1,2019-6-23,1,1,0
"Bought mainly as an ""in case of emergency""/""did I really close the door"" piece of equipment in the never-ending quest to smart-out the house.  Set up was a little finnicky with our Genie opener... getting the MyQ to send the right code took numerous repeated attempts until it finally took.  There is a bit of a delay when opening and closing through the phone - even more of a delay through the watch - but this is/was the simplest way to convert our door to a smart opener.Happy with the purchase but the difficulty with the set up is worth the loss of a star.",4,1,2018-7-31,1,1,0
"I love being able to close and open my garage door remotely. We left on a trip recently and I could not recall if my garage door had been closed so I was very happy to have this app to check on it rather than having to drive back to the house (or send a relative over to do it). I found in this heat wave we have that when both of our cars come in at the end of the day, the garage can get up over 110 degrees and it's cooling down outside so I leave the garage door open for 30 minutes and then close it with the app.  I also use it if I need to let someone into the house remotely - I can just open the door when they arrive and call me.",5,1,2018-8-6,1,0,0
"I got this so that I could make sure the garage was not left open during those times when you just can't remember if you closed it when leaving the house or not. The only reason for the missing fifth star is the voice assistant control is not available without additional cost. It'd be great if I could be driving home and just ask Google to open the door for me, but sadly I either need to be in range with the opener's supplied remote or pickup my phone, open the app, and press the button on the screen.",4,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"Bought this to protect my garage from the street and from our forgetful minds when we leave the house. It notifies us when the garage is left open more than 15 minutes and I am able to close it, even when out of the country.One annoying thing is when you shut it remotely all hell break loose and the neighbors have to hear a SUPER LONG beeping sound that lasts forever. Even after it's closed? Strange. But it's a safety feature, I get it. When there's not eyeballs on the door it's a necessity.",4,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"I was upset about the lack of free Alexa integration at first, and had tried another product that was horrible. Opted to give the MyQ a try and was shocked at how dead simple the install was. Had it paired in 5 minutes and had it fully installed within 15. Honestly I don’t even think I want my garage door accessible by Alexa now that I’ve used it for a while. I love how easy it is to open/close the door with my Apple Watch.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"It works well enough once you get it paired and on your wifi. The app works, but it can be slow. It would benefit from some kind of widget.Unfortunately, they also charge a subscription fee to use your voice assistant. This feels like a money grab. I would have bought something else had I known.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
"Setup was a bit difficult for me--it did not work through the app as expected (otherwise would have given it 5 stars). I needed to search on the internet how to link the hub to my router using WPS. Once the hub linked to my router, I was then able to set up via the app. Other than this annoyance, the product works great. The app is otherwise well designed.***Update Dec 17, 2017***",3,1,2017-12-2,1,1,0
"I thought this was very easy to install and get operational, I had no issues during the process.  I wanted it to determine the status of my garage are any time, or place.  When I leave in the morning for work, I sometimes notice I left the door open overnight and this app will allow me to check that the door is closed during the evening, without having to physically look at it.  I also setup an alert for being open for more than 30 minutes after 10:00 pm.  I'll enable the Amazon delivery option and plan to give access to my kids, but they have other options to use to enter my house.  I'd like to have packages delivered indoors during cold, snowy, or wet days.  I read the critical review about want ""Chamberlain doesn’t tell you (and should!)"" and I agree with about 10% of that.  Most of that was typical to anything WIFI and somewhat overexaggerated.  2.4 GHz is an unlicensed frequency and does compete with other devices using it, but there are channels that separate the spectrum into individual zones, so many different devices can share the same space for Bluetooth and WIFI.  This is a pretty minimal cost now ($30) and I'm thinking I'll get a second one for other garage door too.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"The only thing it has going for it is the customer service. The device is rubbish. I tried to install it using the directions. After an hour I decided to call customer service because it wouldn't connect to my wifi. The customer service rep was awesome and got everything working. I tried 30 minutes later and it refused to close I spent another 30 minutes on it and kept getting an error code. At that point, the device  was crap in my eyes and I sent it back.",2,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"This does not ""technically"" work with Alexa, but there are a few workarounds that are pretty easy to set up. Very easy to install..the only maintenance is changing the battery which is simple. I really like being able to give others access. There is a very loud alarm for 30 seconds before it will close, it cannot be disabled in the settings. I dont mind it but I'm sure some will. It has made my life easier and I would buy it again.",4,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I would have given this product five stars because it was so easy to setup and the app integrates with Amazon Key, but there is no Alexa skill which totally doesn’t make sense. It’s still been great to open my garage door remotely, get status updates when the door is open, and get in home packages. I just can’t get over the fact I can’t say “Alexa, open my garage”.",4,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
I have two Liftmaster 8500 garage door openers that were installed in 2016. I purchased the hub and an extra sensor. I wasted hours trying to get the hub to pair with my wall units. I gave up and called Liftmaster/Chamberlain customer service. I  learned that I didn't need the sensors at all. The nice woman who helped me walked me through the process adding the two garage door openers using my laptop. Now everything works perfectly. I wish that Chamberlain had included these simple instructions in the manual that comes with the hub. The hub gets Five stars. The lack of comprehensive instructions gets 2 stars.,5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0

"I got this product for my mom, so she wouldn't have to worry about packages being stolen from her front door, and no longer worry about if the garage door is open. The product works exactly as stated, I love it, she loves it, the catch is... Amazon key isn't ready in every area yet. I love the product and it was super easy to install, took less then 20 minutes taking my time and even eating while doing so. But check to make sure Amazon key is available in your area first!!",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
Amazon sells this product for their in-garage delivery service (which is  unfortunately not available to me). One would think it would work with Amazon's home control system. IT DOESN'T WORK WITH ALEXA!!After the easy installation I found out that it wiped out our remotes and exterior keypad. This isn't a product- it's a punishment.  don't make the mistake I made. There's a reason Amazon is restricting reviews of this product.,1,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"Like that I can use this product from my cell phone and see when the door was last closed or opened, also open or close it myself from anywhere.Don't really like that I need to mount the unit, either on the wall or on the ceiling. But it is not going to magically mount itself so I guess I will do it. Right now it is setting on a bench in the garage. Works fine, but going to be in the way until I do something with it.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"The product function is great, and the app is intuitive. The finish of the hub or the sensor is a little on the cheap side, but perhaps it does not matter as the product stays in the garage. Installation is a breeze. However, pairing can be frustrating, and this is the only reason I thought the product does not deserve five stars. I started my setup late night, paired the sensor with the hub and picked things up the next day. While the app reasonably picked up where I had left off I kept running into an error in the subsequent steps. The app seemed to go in a loop asking me to pair the hub to the garage door; the garage would open and close, but the system would produce an error. I changed so many things including erasing all remotes from the garage door opener. I reset the hub, and I even installed and started using the old Chamberlin app. Nothing worked, until I decided to also delete the sensor pairing from the hub. Once this was done, in the old app I managed to pair the hub with the garage door. The settings between the two apps were based on my account and everything worked. I deleted the old app, and now everything works nominally - happy with the product. I hope that MyQ developers do something about this finicky pairing process.",4,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0

So nice to be able not only to check it from my phone, but to be able to close it when I'm not even home.  Only concern is I'm worried the little sensor that goes on the garage door will stay on there.  I'm in South Carolina and our temps are already in the high 90's.  Hope it doesn't melt that little sucker right off our garage door....",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"Overall, the device was easy to install and get working with my garage and my WiFi network. However, they require a premium subscription if you want to use it with IFTTT, Google Home, Alexa, etc. Seriously? It's definitely not worth $10/month. That's the about the price of Amazon Prime where you get Amazon Video, basic Amazon music, better shipping, etc. However, this device thinks integrating with other services is worth that. Move on to something else.",1,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"This product works as described. Easy/simple install that took less than 15 minutes total. Easy integration with App.No major issues, other than if by chance you have door sensors that will not allow the door to close if something is blocking it, once that trips, you have to manually close the door via the physical button and reset the unit, then reset your phone app for all to resync.

I also like the warning light and audible alarm when closing the door with the app.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying the product works great. The one thing I would warn buyers about is that when setting up there is an option to scan the serial number on the back of the hub (the bigger piece) or enter it manually. I tried probably ten times of going through the process fully from start to finish to get my hub to link to my receiver. The last time I went through the motions before I sent it back was enter the number in manually. Before you knew it in no time everything linked fine and was working great. For some reason it seems when scanning it it wasn’t filling connecting somehow. I also had issue with it connecting to my WiFi which posed an issue but everything worked fine once I entered the number manually. Maybe coincidence, maybe not. Also, as a side note the unit will beep and flash the light when choosing to close the garage door from the app. I have researched and there is no way to disable this as they say it is a safety feature mandated to stay on. Other than that it is great!",4,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"This was a little finicky to setup, but it got the job done in the end for my 2 year old MyQ Liftmaster.  Worked great for a few months, then it suddenly stopped working.

"The only reason I'm reviewing is to help others. I searched high and low (aka google'd the crap out of it) to figure out if this would work with my Overhead Odyssey 1000 (Model 7030) opener. There were a couple of reviews that said it wouldnt work and one said it would. MyQ web sites / compatibility checker would say YES on one page and no on another. The answer is YES it DOES work. Not just monitoring mode but, it will open the door. YOU do need your transmitter remote to program it. Most importantly follow these steps and repeat them several times (took like 20-30 mins to get the right combo to make this work). Step 1, tap the black program button 1 time (blue like flashes), then quickly again (purple light flashes, your in program model). Step 2, click and hold door open button on your transmitter for like 2 seconds (DONT KEEP holding it, doesnt work). This should now help MyQ program the door. I will open and close the door fairly quickly, then will open (2nd open fairly quickly), and the last close wont happen for like 1 or 2 mins so be patient. Now your good. As for the product, it works well, I would like the ability for it to self close after x period of time based on a rule. It will warn you but, doesnt close it automatically.",4,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0

Nice, easy to use app that lets you know if door is up or down and lets you open and close door remotely.  Installed mine in 10 minutes.  Instructions say to mount hub on garage ceiling but I mounted mine on the wall because it was easier.  Works great.  I don’t know why anyone would buy a device that requires hard wiring.

Slightly more complicated than things like light switches since you need to use simple commands and set up a routine in Alexa but not difficult.  The warning light and alarm when closing the door are, personally, annoying but you can't slight them for safety.  Some electrical tape easily blocks out the blinding light.  Other wise it's great to be able to say a command and have the garage door open.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0

My home lost Internet connectivity due to a power outage at my ISP.  When that connectivity was restored, my MYQ door opener picked up the signal but being it had lost connectivity the garage door just kept opening and closing when connectivity was restore.  IF my son had not been home all afternoon my house could have been open for anyone to enter.

"We made the decision to purchase this as we wanted the ability to open our garage door using a phone app so when riding our motorcycle it would be possible to open/close the door without carrying an opener.  The opener couldn't be easier to install, took less than 10 minutes.  Works as advertised, easily open/close the garage door with the app and you can easily see when the door is open or closed.  Also provides notifications when there is movement of the door.  Ready to try Amazon Key but want a camera in the garage just to be safe and a ring camera looks easy enough to pair for added peace of mind.My one disappointment is I have yet to figure how to easily pair with Alexa.  We are an Alexa house, not Google, and while I think its possible there are conflicting reports online and requires more research than I'm willing to commit right now.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0

I can check my phone immediately and check the status.  You can also let someone in your garage by using the app and then closing when they leave.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

"My garage door was installed some 15 years ago so I installed this door opener kit for the advantage of having control over the garage gate when i'm away from home.  It works really great and so far I'm extremely pleased.  My only hurdle during initial setup was to get the hub connected to my wi-fi as the included instructions are not very clear.  That said, I found thorough instructions without much difficulty on the chamberlain website.  Two nice features are that (i) i can check the garage door status from any location and (iI) the audible alert the hub emits  just before and during door closure.",4,1,2018-4-21,1,1,0

I was told by a garage door installer that I had to buy a new garage door opener in order to achieve control of the door from my phone, but that was not true. This allows me to determine the position of my door, i.e. whether it is up or down, and to open and close the door from anywhere my cell phone has access.

However, when it comes to closing the door, it beeps and flashes a bright light for about 5 seconds before it triggers the door.

If you have a product like this you need to have a well documented process or a simple enough app to handle the configuration.The box comes with two pamphlets, one looks like a book, another like a loose sheet. The loose sheet is key to configure it. That's a really bad design. These guys need a better design department and a less technical team to go over the design of their apps.",3,1,2017-11-27,1,1,0
"I tried to set up Google integration and after setting up the account, found that myQ no longer supports the feature even though they still show it on their website and allow your to subscribe.  Without Smart Home compatibility the product is very limited in having to be controlled from only the app.  I cannot recommend the product until they re-add the smart home features (and not charge for them).Look into a Google/Alexa WiFi Smart Garage Door Controller instead to have a device they can actually perform basic functions (and costs a little less than this myQ).",2,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"This device works fine UNTIL you try to use your existing remotes - then the nightmares begin. Installing the MyQ and the app was relatively simple, but then the remotes in my cars didn't work, nor did the existing wireless keypad. One of my cars has a handheld remote and I was able to get that to work relatively easily. My Audi uses HomeLink and it took over 45 minutes on the phone with tech support before that worked. The wireless keypad never worked, in spite of calls to tech support. Their final suggestion was to remove ALL existing programing and start over. Given the extreme difficulty with programing my HomeLink remote, that was unacceptable. So now I have a functioning MyQ and a useless wireless keypad.",2,1,2018-4-2,1,2,0

"Any issues I had were ""operator error"", my errors when connecting to my WiFi. Actually I was pressing the wrong Color Learn button on my Garage door opener. I have a problem with some colors. Once I pressed the correct color Learn button it was easy-peasy from there.  I was never sure if I closed the garage door at night, or even if it was open or closed. Now, as long as I'm within my WiFi range I know if the Garage door is open or closed..  also, it shows you the last ""status"" , Closed or Open...  so if you drive away and not sure if you closed the garage door, all you have to do is check the App and see what the last Status was ...  giving you piece of mind..  so I think it's cooler than sliced bread !!  only thing I didn't like is how loud the Alarm is. When the door closes it Blares out a loud Alarm and flashing light warning that the door is about to close..  but I wrapped a piece of carpet around the speaker to muffle it a tad..

And 2) It's a different ap so my home automation is split between this and my alexa and my samsung smart hub devices.  You get the notifications on your phone anyway so probably doesn't really matter that I have so many devices to get my home automated.  The price was great!

And does it well.",5,1,2018-9-7,1,2,0
"After 2 hours of attempting to install this unit to sync to my Liftmaster opener (only 5 years old), I finally gave up and tried to chat with tech the manufacturer tech support. They never could understand the problem and they disconnected the chat conversation. Called their tech support - waited in the que for 30 minutes - explained the situation as I have strong wifi signal and clear line of site to the opener. Still won't work - after a long conversation they said that they were going to transfer me to a ""tier 2"" technical rep and I told them that I was unwilling to wait another 30-45 minutes on hold. The customer service rep didn't seem to care that I was frustrated - I gave up and returned it to Amazon for a full refund. Bad product - bad service.",1,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"In my previous house I had a garage door that had myQ built in, after having that, when I moved to my new home I knew I had to have it again. This product makes it possible without having to install a whole new garage door opener. It was very easy to install. It allows you to program alerts, like when the door opens, etc. and if you can’t remember if you closed the garage door you can just check the app. One of the coolest features is being able to open the garage door from the app, from anywhere! You’re out of town and you need to let someone in your house but they don’t have a key, no problem. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I purchased this product with the intent to compliment my existing classic remotes. I anticipated it being an easy install. However, I took a journey through several calls to customer service and techs. I consider myself a techie, but the install was complex and a waste of time.I spent a lot of time on the phone with their IT trying to figure it out. They attempted to update the firmware to no avail. After several tries the IT person said they would mail another one to me.",3,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"I love this product! It’s a great addition to our very old garage door opener, and a great addition to our smart home. Before, we had trouble using the keypad to open our garage because the buttons would stick. Now, in one click, we can use our phone to open our garage in a matter of seconds! You can secure it using Face ID or Touch ID, so if someone gets access to your phone, they can’t get access to your garage. It’s also incredibly easy to install and to pair with the garage door. I highly recommend this!",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,1
"Great product setup was easy and once the app is installed is very easy to set up. I will suggest that if you are using it on a garage door that is facing the sun most of the day you don't want to use the supplied 3M strips as the door will get really hot and the sensor will fall off. What I suggest is that you use zip ties to hold it in place. And with that being done like that it's easy to get off in case you have to replace the garage door or you have to relocate to a new house and you can take that device with you. Great product works well with Google just do not like that you have to pay for the integration. But hey it works like a champ. You can open and close your door from anywhere. And if you pair it with a video doorbell you can sign up for the Amazon prime keychain, that will open your garage door start recording with the video doorbell when you have packages delivered via Amazon.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"This does not work consistently and it gives way too many false alarms and data.  I set up an alert to notify me if the garage door remain open for more than 5 min.  Unfortunately, I have received numerous false alerts and it has cause serious problems.  On at least 3 occasions, when no one was home and the garage door was closed, I received the alert that the door was open.  Then the APP also showed the door to be open.  On those 3 occasions I then used the APP to close the door remotely but in reality, I was actually opening the door.  It was only thanks to a friendly neighbor that called to tell me that my garage door was open that I realized that the APP and the alert did not work and gave false data.  I have since disconnected the unit and determined that I had wasted my money.",1,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0

I wanted to be able to check it from my phone for piece of mind, and then have the ability to close it remotely, should I need to.This product checks all of those boxes. The actual physical installation was simple. We have 16' ceilings in the garage, so I was a bit worried if the distance between the box and the part you attach to the garage door was too far apart. No problems thus far.",5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,0
"So you consider purchasing this, but then you read the reviews from ""experts"" who install this stuff ""for a living.""  And they say, ""don't buy this.""  Well, consider the fact that the ""experts"" usually are of the opinion that they do not need hand holding nor do they need to follow directions.  I have learned, in watching ""experts"" that they commonly ignore written directions and just dive in.  My experience with things that use Wifi and Bluetooth is that you follow the steps exactly as they are listed, and when you do, usually the thing just works -- correctly, the first time.  Which was my experience.  Took me all of 20 minutes to unbox, watch a video, follow the in app guide and have it installed.  Works as advertised.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"We are very happy with the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener.  It is worth the price alone just to be able to check the garage door status remotely to make sure it is shut. Love the history showing the opening and closing record as well. Would have given it five stars, but it does occasionally fail to open when triggered. It took a little work to sync it with our garage door opener, but not too excessive.",4,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"I installed it quickly and was impressed that it was really easy to install. I understand the need that it has an alarm to let you know that the door is going to shut or open but I don’t have children or any reason to have an alarm on it and there’s no way to shut it off.  At least it’s not too loud although it is definitely noticeable, I was worried I would hear it in the house and my garage door gets opened at all hours so I was a little worried but that part isn’t too bad. There is definitely a few seconds of lag time because it wants to  have the audible alarm give you some notice before it opens her shuts.But overall, I would definitely recommend this as it makes it so much easier to open the garage door as my keypad and remotes are often finicky and I have had no problem whatsoever with the app functioning correctly.  I wish I had hooked it up sooner .",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0

I had to get a door sensor for my garage door to reliable know when it was opening and closing. My Wifi signal was quite strong (~60db) so I wasn’t sure if it was perhaps an issue on MYQ’s end.Flash forward a few months, I splurged on the brand new model and it has worked perfectly since day 1, no issues what soever. On the one hand, this is the functionality I expected with the original, but on the other hand, I’m happy the new model greatly improved in connectively and reliability.",5,1,2017-12-1,1,1,0
Wow. Installation was easy. None of the problems I read in some reviews. Downloaded the App and followed the step by step process. Adding the second door unit also simple.  Very satisfied.

"What better than being able to control and keep an eye on your garage from a distance.In the age of remote garage door openers, it's nice to know if someone got a hold of your code (easy to do) and is entering your garage. Especially if your garage is the entry into your home. I have a 2 car garage and bought 2 sensors. Easy to install.  Only think I've noticed is both doors will not receive a signal if you use the app and hit open/close too close in time. Give it a few seconde between sending the signal and you're good to go. The doors open and close every time. No problems!",5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0

I like having control of my garage door from anywhere and getting notifications when the door opens and closes. I get my prime packages delivered in the garage now using amazon key. I read some not so good reviews on the installation process and was a little weary about buying this just for that reason but I can honestly say that after watching a YouTube video and following the step by step instructions and a little common sense (my wife helped me) we were able to have it up and running in just minutes. We love this garage door opener. I would recommend this for anyone wanting control of their garage door from their smart phone and to anyone who likes getting notifications when the door has opened and closed.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

"A few years ago I installed a Garagio system to my existing not-smart Genie garage door opener.  The Garagio system pretty much provides the same smartphone functions but was way more complicated to install and involved wiring and such.  A couple years went by and I could not get it to work again after changing networks.  When I read the install instructions for the Chamberlain I literally thought it could not be this easy and thought I must have bought the wrong product.  Nope, I bought the right thing and it was a complete breeze to install.  If you have the technical ability to install a light bulb then you can do this.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
I like the fact that I can check anywhere and anytime to see if the door is open/closed. This gives me some piece of mind as I have left the house before and then wondered if I shut the garage door from the car when leaving. Some things you sort of do automatically but then later begin to wonder if you did indeed do it. Install was quite easy but getting the unit to talk to my garage door opener was frustrating when following the guide. Finally the next day I tried it again a few times and low and behold it worked to my amazement. My only dislike now is the annoying beeping sound it makes when closing and still continues to make for about 10 seconds after the door has been fully closed. Think I'll open it up and try putting some tape over the beeper opening to lower the volume. I still want to hear the beep as a test for the door mounted part of the system to insure that it's battery is good and is communicating OK.,4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"It's cool that this allows you to control most garage door openers via the MyQapp,but I bought it because it advertised Google home integration and control, yet it requires a subscription to do so AND it does not open or close via Google home. After a long run around of filling useless guides from MyQ that are completely inaccuate, I got Google assistant on my phone to tell me if the door is open or closed, but only if I say a very specific command like ""Hey Google, ask MyQ if the garage door is open"" then I have to wait for it to connect and then the weird MyQ voice says yes or no. Very terrible integration with Google assistant, no integration with Google home, and false advertising. Will be returning immediately.",1,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0

This is the second MyQ sensor I've purchased.  I'm using it on my single garage door and links up to my first MyQ sensor on my double garage door.  It works like a charm and installation was a breeze.  Only criticism I have is the sensor alerts for open/close on the MyQ app seem to have a random delay built in.  Some times when I open the garage door I'll get an instant alert on the app that it has opened and other times it can take up to an hour.  To me it's not a big deal and I didn't think it changes the functionality of the devices capabilities in my case.  The MyQ system has always opened and closed the garage doors within seconds and without fail.  For the price ($20 black Friday deal) I highly recommend this system.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

It works. My biggest complaint is that they have it locked down so you can't actually do anything useful with it unless you pay their monthly fee. It's a ridiculous to make people who are buying a smart device then have to pay monthly to use the smart device. This will be returned and I'll purchase a different brand from a different company that will do more and integrate with Alexa directly without a fee. The device also takes and extremely long time to open and close the door.,2,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0
I installed one for my daughter and liked the concept so I ordered one for myself. It worked at my daughters house until Amazon had a delivery. After opening the door the Amazon driver couldn’t shut the door. The driver did the right thing and waited until someone was able to close the door. On the one I installed 40% of the time after I leave and close the door I get an alert saying it’s open. Support had me remove the app and install again. Still didn’t work so I’m returning it.

The reason for the three on the installs I have a Chamberlain Access Master garage door opener.  In the instructions it does not tell you to not as in delete the sensor on the door because you do not need it if you have a recent Access Master garage door opener.  I have no clue why there is no instructions telling you to delete.  After 30 minutes on the phone and deleting the sensor off the app and starting over it works fine with a double tap on the icon to open and it double tap to close.  It worked at the beginning with the sensor so I don't know where it went wrong maybe an update or something.  Now with the deleted door sensor I only have the Wi-Fi hub and the garage door opener I hope this helps everybody else.  obviously the 3 stars is for the instructions not saying to not use the sensor with my particular garage door opener.  Could easily put an app instruction in or post something on the website and the frequently asked questions.  I mean how hard would it be to take one sentence and put it in???,5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
After reading the reviews I was a bit doubtful of this but decided the price was low enough to take a chance.  The install was super easy just by following the directions on the app.  I have LED lights and cameras in my garage and everything works well with no interference.

"What I liked best about MyQ is that it was super affordable and very easy to install. What I find I needed to learn is that it does not operate immediately. What I mean is the device has a built in flashing light and beeper. These go off for about 15 seconds before it closes the door. Also, it can take awhile (think 10 minutes or more) for the app to determine if the door is actually closed or open. I learned that it doesn't matter - the app has a single button to click, and it then opens a closed door or closes an open door. It can be controlled by more than one phone.

I did a couple things as mentioned in the reviews; I stayed away from any LED shop lights, and did read through the directions (I'm a guy... we don't always do that). As it turns out, it went just as simple as some of the other reviews mentioned. It was up and running in less than 30 minutes. My Apple Watch let's me know when the door opens, and when it closes. And I can check the status on my iPhone (I wish I could do that with Siri, but I have to purchase a Apple Homekit to make that happen. I don't need that feature that bad; I just open the app on the phone to see that the door status is open or closed). So far... I would purchase this again.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"This is strictly a review of the installation. I was at first dismayed at the lack of printed physical installation instructions but after installing the iPhone app and creating an account I realized the app itself will guide you through the step by step of adding the MyQ.I was adding this to an Overhead door opener that was installed in 2006 and was compatable. My Wi-Fi signal strength in the garage was spotty but ended up being adequate. My hub is mounted at eye level on the garage wall 10 ft. from the opener and easily connected during the Wi-Fi pairing phase. I currently have two remotes and a wireless keypad paired to the opener and was able to add the MyQ with no trouble (I mention this because your opener may have a limit as to the number of devices that can be paired) The door sensor attachment and pairing went just as the step by step indicated with no hitches. I installed an additional app on another iPhone in the household and logged it in as me. The app functioned as expected so it wasn't necessary to Invite the additional person as a guest user. Since the MyQ has only been installed a couple of hours, exhaustive testing hasn't been done but so far it appears to be a good investment",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
This is an awesome product.  I have a garage door by Overhead Door and the MyQ device works great with it.  Fairly easy to install but you will most likely need to climb a ladder in order to mount and configure the device to work with your garage door opener.  Works OK with Google Assistant.  It was a little tricky getting it set up and still having issues getting it to OPEN via Google Assistant.  Most of the time I just use the MyQ app with no issues at all.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"This system is very glitchy and does not sync well with the app. The door open/closed status, on the app, is often incorrect - defeating the purpose of the system. Multiple re-attempts to close a door showing open will result in an error and instruction to close locally. I am disappointed in the robustness of this system, especially since it is intended to provide peace of mind and security while away from home.",1,1,2019-6-18,1,1,0
"Bought one of these a couple of weeks ago.  It should be compatible with my Chamberlain Garage door opener.  No matter what I tried I could not get the hub to pair with my opener.  Got on the phone with Chamberlain support and, after over an hour on the phone with them, they said that the hub was bad and sent me a replacement.  Got the replacement today and I have the same problem.  No matter what I do it will not pair with my opener.  I’ll just return everything to Amazon as this product is clearly full of problems.",1,1,2019-7-3,1,1,0
Got this after we left the garage door open for a whole night. Luckily nothing happened.I use it with a wink hub  so I created a notification to be sent if the door stays open for 15 minutes.,5,1,2018-12-23,1,0,0
"This is NOT Apple HomeKit or Alexa compatible.  I purchased it thinking that it would compatible with one of them.  Other than that, this works just fine.  I have a bad habit of not closing my garage for the day.  Now I can just open the app to see if it’s open or not.  I can also program it to close at certain times of the day - like after my kids leave for school and at the end of the day when they are done playing outside.  Also, is like a third opener if I am a passenger in someone else’s car since my garage is the main entrance point.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"The MyQ opener not only provides a new confidence in knowing if my garage door has been opened, or that it simply didn't close properly, but also a restored confidence from a stellar Customer Support team. I had to call their tech support team because the hub would not link properly to my garage door opener during the installtion process (which by the way was very simple except for this.) Opener hub and free app both work great and I can open or close the door from any where. I also removed my remote openers from my vehicles in the case my car was broken into. You can also email a temporary or permanent access link to service people or friends. Super happy with the product and I would recommend.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"This is a nice way to get your garge door to becomes ""smart"".  However, the google intergration is quite bad to say the least.

"I had two nice MyQ battery backup door openers at my old home and loved the app and the ability to know what was the status of doors at anytime.  So, I bought this unit thinking it would do everything the built in system did - I was wrong.  It only does rudimentary functions and the app seems stripped down without all the reporting options.

I searched on line first for the entire process in a video so I had a picture of the install from end to end. I was working in about 10 degrees F so you used a heat gun to warm the place where I mounted the sensor on the door. My garage is detached and about 50 feet from my house where I have my Google Mesh network. My garage door opener is a fairly recent LiftMaster. I had installed a Chamberlain door opener with WIFI on my other door on the same garage so I had the app already installed on my iPhone.The install took about 1/2 hour. Other than my fingers freezing I didn't encounter any issues and I'm happy with the results. I haven't taken advantage of the Alexa integration or Amazon deliveries.

"Hands down the worst purchase I have made for my home.I have owne the myq garage door opener for 2 weeks, i checked multiple sites to verify the compatability of my garage door.

It mostly works as advertised. I can control opening and closing the garage door from my phone. The problem is it will not reliably tell you if you left the door open or not. I’m constantly getting notifications that I left it open after leaving the house. Kind of defeats the main purpose of this thing for me. Support said reinstall app and swap in new door sensor batteries but that didn’t change anything.,2,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

"I love this product! It works great as advertised once you follow the installation directions strictly. Most importantly, you need to check first with any mobile device for signal strength of your WiFi from your garage and once the signal is strong enough, you can go ahead and follow the simple instructions for the installation. It took few minutes to install and it works flawlessly. I have opened and close my garage remotely without any problems. It works alright with Amazon’s key app but  I’m yet to hook it up with Alexa. I believe it will work okay as well. Buy with confidence and follow the instructions accordingly and you won’t have any problems whatsoever.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"My wife and I have a bad habit of leaving our garage door open.  We also wanted a way to open the garage door when we didn't have access to the standard remote.  Since we seem to always have our cell phones with us, this sounded like the perfect solution.  It is!  The instructions can be a bit vague, and their videos could be complete.  Rather than providing those, they rely on the app to walk you through things.  That ended up being sufficient.  Fortunately, I am a technical person.The remote control through the app is great!  Being able to configure alerts based on time of day and mode is great as well.  The very best thing is that this works perfectly with our existing door opener, which is about 12 years old.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0

"I bought this product for peace of mind to know that my garage door has remained closed.  So many false alarms telling me my door is open and then not letting me close it remotely, because as it turns out it was never open.  Just got another false alert and had to climb a ladder to unplug the unit to reboot it as this can't be done from the app.  I'm about ready to throw it in the trash.  Shame on Chamberlain for this product.",1,1,2020-9-27,1,1,0
"Installation was a piece of cake and it works well.  the only complaint I have is that you have to have an internet connection for it to work.  It often needs to sign in to the app when I open it.  If my internet connection or the app server is running slow, it can take forever to open my garage door.  This inconvenience stands out to me because the last wifi opener I had (app no longer on app store), only needed a wifi connection and was always signed in.  I understand the internet connectivity is required to see the status of your door when you're away from home, it just gets a little tedious waiting for the app to sign in.",4,1,2019-1-13,1,0,0

"I bought before I moved 3 miles away and found out that Amazon Key services not available in my new location yet which was the primary reason I bought this.  This is my fault, but I was also hoping that the smart door opener would work with Alexa devices but was not able to find with device search and couldn't find an Alexa Skill related to this device.  Set up straight forward but took several attempts and repeated attempts and more attempts until it finally connected.  It took a couple hours total time for installation due to repeated attempts.  It could have installed in less than 30 minutes with a faster connection to garage door opener.  Not sure why it took so long since this is the same brand as my garage door opener.  Overall it works well, but not for the purposes that I intended.  For the $20 I paid, I will keep it on my door in the hopes that Alexa and Amazon Key services will expand.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"This product has exceeded my expectations. Of course when I buy something, I always wonder if it will work the way I expect it too. This did. Installation was a breeze. The app literally takes you step by step and even uses videos in some parts. This item took me less than 15 min to install from start to finish. The remote open/close from the app has worked great. Anywhere I get phone signal, I can open and shut the door. One of my favorite features is the alerts. I set it up to get an alert every time my door is opened or closed. I also love that I can go the app to check if the door is open or closed and for how long. This was a great security and convenience add for my home.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,1
"Set up was terrible until I read the tips below from Eric E. Peterson on January 20, 2019:""After hours of trying to figure out how to pair to Liftmaster 8500 (and possibly any Liftmaster after 2004), I finally figured it out. Surprised there wasn’t anything to be found online. When pairing you select your garage door manufacturer as Security+ 2.0 (not Liftmaster). Security 2.0+ is really the sub-name and model of later Liftmasters, despite not being written anywhere on the device itself. You also select the Yellow button. If you have a wall switch with the MyQ image, instead of pushing the learn button on the garage door opener itself, you double tap the learn button on the switch. This should allow you to pair.""",3,1,2019-6-11,1,1,0

I don't have Google Home or anything similar so I can't comment on that, I just wanted the ability to monitor/control from my phone and it seems to do that.

Now, less than a month from replacing it with a lithium battery, I'm getting a notification that the battery is low again. It has gotten cold, but, for a device that only operates a couple of times a day, this is ridiculous. I expect that the battery should last for 3-6 months, not a month or less!",3,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"Using it for about 5 months. Very happy with the product. There is slight lag between the action and receiving the notification on my cell, but not a major deal.Was extremely easy to install. I did not install the hub on the ceiling, rather have it on the side wall close to the power outlet and it is working fine. Loved the convenience of being able to open and check the garage door remotely as well as checking its status. Very convenient. Has been working flawlessly so far. Will definitely recommend.",5,1,2019-3-1,1,0,0
"I would not recommend this product as it poses several security issues.  First the installation process is far from easy.  Pairing the sensor to the hub and configuring the internet connect was smooth.  It’s pairing the device hub to your garage door opener motor.  Took several attempts, then would not work properly.  Then at 1am in the morning it would open automatically.  Researching this was determined to be a glitched and I was instructed to reprogram it.  Then twice in the day I got the alert it opened automatically, so I looked at my outside camera to determine if someone was trying to gain access with the pad, nothing but I noticed my neighbor coming home and the second time was my other neighbor opening his garage door.  The engineering of these devices needs looking at so I am returning it and going another direct.",1,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
It may work for other people but it didn't work for me. It would work 2 or 3 times and then just stop working. They recommended moving the hub to different parts of the ceiling.

"I found the installation of this very simple and the app provided easy step by step instructions. Works great and easy to open and close from the app. One little point to note. It does make a considerable amount of noise and flashes a light when you close it remotely. This is obviously a safety feature to warn anyone nearby that it is closing so they won't be hit by the door.

It correctly senses door open 100% of the time. It senses door closed unreliably so using the device to alert you that the door was left open has enough false alarms that it trains you to ignore it.

"I gave this a three-star rating for one reason alone: I was not able successfully to set it up. The reason was very simple, as this device requires a reasonably strong WiFi signal IN THE GARAGE, and I don't have that. I live in an apartment, and my garage is far enough away that the signal from my router is very weak--not strong enough for this device to connect.

"Just bought this and struggled with the pairing so I eventually called customer support.  First, I was told that the hub should NOT be very close to the actually opener.  I moved it further away and still had issues so next was to remove the LED light bulb.  Still no go but when he heard that it was an opener from 2006, even though the Learn button was green I actually had to select purple and it worked.  He had me mount the hub across the garage and have no problem with the connection.  It does send off this piercing sound when activated which is pretty annoying.  I'd like to shut that off!!  So overall, it seems to do the job.  The primary purpose is so my handicapped son can open the garage without his aids knowing the code.  I added the app to his iPod and it works fine.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"The unit seems to work well so far and if it continues this way I will be happy! Mounting of the unit is pretty straight forward but getting it all to work is another thing. If you are not tech-savvy I would suggest professional installation even the instructions say""be patient this may take several attempts"" but once working it does work well. The placement of both units is very important.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"Does what it says in that it opens and closes the door and provides feedback about whether the door is open or closed. I thought from the description that it gave an indication of how far open the door is, but really it doesn't matter and it only says when it was last opened or closed last. Seems quite simple, but does the job. Have not tried to integrate with alexa as I am not comfortable with that level of internet activity for a security device.",4,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"This is an easy product. It has its own app that lets you see the status of your garage door and how long it’s been that way and you can easily open or close it from the app on your phone. This does not have any integration natively with Alexa though so don’t expect any voice commands or hearing Alexa telling you the garage is open or what not.

"I buy my fair share of cheap imported electronics on Amazon and many miss the mark.  This thing was crazy cheap (Xmas sale) so I was half expecting to find that it either it did not work or the installation was too complicated.  To my pleasant surprise,  it worked right away and the installation was simple!  I am loving this - I get a beep and notification each time I leave the house so no more second guessing if I closed the garage door.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
My husband installed this by himself in about 15 minutes after watching the video. We love this so much we tell everyone about smart openers! My brother and father-in-law bought themselves one already which makes it really handy for all of us to help watch houses etc. The app is easy to use and the ability to set a program to always shut the garage at 10pm in case we forget to close it adds extra peace of mind.,5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0

"So far so good. Had to consult the manual for garage door pairing but ultimately worked relatively quickly. I typically research more but didn't realize that at some point Chamberlain was charging a subscription fee to use with Google Home (what???!!!). I don't think they should act like they are doing a favor to provide it free to use my Google Home to operate the door. Also, I can't open the door. Weird. If they say it's for safety, you let me decide that with the option at least. Otherwise I give 4 stars because it's nice to not forget to close the door like I did the prior night to installing and it's cheaper than I thought to add this function to my home than I thought it would be.",4,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"Got this on Treasure Truck for an amazing price below what is listed here. Installation was a breeze and took 10-15 min. The app will walk you though the installation process. The MyQ app works great to open and close the garage. The only con is when closing using the app, the SmartHub with beep and flash it’s light as a warning to others.Other than that great product and highly recommend",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Item works as it should Found to be easy to set up and install. (Wireless signal in garage is only about two bars) Make sure you make sure that your door opener works with this unit. If you go to the manufacturer web site they list by Model number each unit this will work with.  So, I you buy and it not combatable it’s on you. The only thing I found is that my standard garage door openers stopped working after. It’s been too hot to mess with, I think if I re-sync them to the opener they will work but can’t say for sure.  I do like being able to tell if I forgot to close the door from anywhere.",5,1,2018-5-26,1,0,0

"Got this on Amazon Prime Day for a great price.  Easy to set up and so far works as described and as expected.  Gives you peace of mind when away from home and wondering if you remembered to shut the door.

Very easy to install and app works great BUT NO Alexa integration and it has a built in alarm when you use the app to close the door that is louder than any smoke detector you’ve ever heard and way way way too long. I put some duct tape over the speaker holes on the control unit and it’s still loud enough to raise the dead. Luckily it only goes off when you are closing the door from the app.,3,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
Opened no problem. Error continuously when closing. Can’t reach Amazon. Spent hours on line and then with a delightful and knowledgeable young tech at Chamberlain  MyQ and we realized instructions are not correct when working with a garage door that has a metal brace for stability and rigidity at top of panel which holds sensor.

"I would give ZERO star for Alexa integration. THERE IS NO OFFICIAL ALEXA SKILL FOR MyQ. Not able to discover MyQ in Alexa app. The product description claims it works with Amazon Key, made me think it is compatible with Alexa App. Amazon Key allows random delivery guy to open your garage door for delivery but does not give you voice control to open/close your own garage door. If you want a smart home garage door opener that integrates with Alexa, try other products.Installation was easy, though had to climb ladder to mount hub to the ceiling.

Note that you will need 2 units for 3 doors which is a shame as I can't imagine the unit would cost much more for 3 doors.  On the other hand, if you like the safety feature of the light blinking before the door goes down, then ideally having one unit per door would be the best from a safety perspective in a public area, but in a home, I sure wish it would support 3 doors.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"I'm all about IoT, but this device just doesn't work that great. in the last 2 months that I've had it, I've had to rejoin the device 2 times to the phone app. The app is able to open the garage door, but it can't close it.

"It works great and Amazon Key with the MyQ has been great, especially given the reports of stolen packages in our neighborhood. Installation was a bit glitchy, some because of me and some because of the product. First you actually need to give it some distance from your garage opener in order for it to work. Too close and the signal won't register. Second, it synced incorrectly to the device on the door that detects the garage door being open or closed. So, undoing and redoing that was a pain that required resetting the system. Nonetheless, once we got through that everything has been great. Amazon has access to my garage and leaves the packages conveniently out of the way of the cars (that's more Amazon being Amazon than the opener but the integration is nice).",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0

"Use the installation tips from Steve in the list of reviews.  With his guidance,  it took 20 minutes to install.  Works great.  I like the flashing light to warn of a remote closure.  No interference with the LED lights I have on the ceiling.  I will not have to reverse course to check that I remembered to close the door.  Great peace of mind.  Plus, since you are informed if it opens, it may alert you to a break-in.  Thieves like to kick down the front door, pull their van/truck into your garage and close the door.  I recommend this device.",5,1,2018-10-29,1,0,0
"Would not pair with the opener. Called support and they said it was my led ceiling lights causing interference and it will never work. Lights were off, so I don't understand that. Whatever.

Works very well. My only dislike is sometimes the notifications that the door has opened are delayed by several minutes.  90% of the time it tells you within the first thirty seconds to a minute of the door opening.I did have a problem of the MyQ malfunctioning but the company was very responsive and helped me troubleshoot and fix it right away.

Checked and confirmed my opener is compatible and checked for obstructions.  I also checked and WiFi signal is very strong, even reset to default settings and reinstalled but no improvement.

Besides, when I upgraded my home wifi, teaching this device to use the new wifi was tremendously easier than my IP cameras!  The thing I love most, that I wasn't even expecting, is the push notifications that alert me when the garage door has been opened.

"I purchased MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener early this year. Due to the busy work schedule, I installed it about two months ago. Following the instructions, the hardware installation was easy; however, the instructions to run the app was not clear on the instruction sheets (after the account set up) comparing with what was showing on the app. Fortunately, I did some Google searches and got the app working. My wife and I love the push notifications to our cell phones when our garage opens and closes. However, there have been a about three times when the garage door opened, then closed. We received 3 notifications each time: (1) Garage opened; (2) Garage closed; (3) Garage opened after the garage door was close! The first time, I already left my home and my wife called me and asked me if the garage door was opened. I had to turn around and drove back home to make sure the garage door was closed (and it was closed!). The last time it happened was this morning! Luckily, I checked the push notification. Sure, there was a message the garage door was opened, but it was actually closed (in front of me!). So, I opened and closed the garage door again. I received only one notification that the garage door was closed, no notification when it was opened the second time!This issue could be from the garage door coming down a little hard; therefore, the sensor installed on the door could sense the door bounced, so it might trigger the garage door opened message, but in reality it's still closed! But this is my assumption! Hopefully, there will be some fixes in the future. May be I should install a camera in my garage in the future to make sure the garage door was closed! I gave 4 stars because of the push notifications, if there was no error push notification, I would give it 5 stars.",4,1,2018-5-7,1,0,0

"My favorite feature of this was how ridiculously easy it was to install. The app guides you through a fool-proof installation process that is just so easy! I haven't been able to get Alexa to open/close it, and sadly it doesn't connect to SmartThings like I'd hoped. There is a short lag time on opening/closing it from the app, but only a few seconds more than you'd expect. Overall, very happy with it and a great product for the price!",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"We have older model Chamberlain Garage Door Openers, and sometimes we get busy bringing in groceries or supplies and forget to close the Garage Doors, OOPS! This just happened which is why I purchased the MYQ Hub + an extra door sensor since we have (2) garage doors. Install was a breeze. I was nervous I would mess it up however, with the easy to follow instructions after downloading the Free App there was no reason to worry. It walks you through all the steps. Easy Breezy. The only thing I had my husband do was mount the Hub Bracket to a ceiling joist. Everything else I was able to do myself which was great. I love being able to see via message on my phone that the garage doors are open or closed. Just make sure you have a WI-FI connection and you should be good to go.",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"I feel like the app reports that my MyQ is offline 70-80% of the time. I set up an access point in the garage to help its connectivity but have not seen an improvement. It occasionally lets me open the garage and then say it's offline before I can close it.I got the device to use with Amazon in-garage delivery. Once, the delivery person couldn't get the garage open and left the package at my front door. Worse was when they opened the garage, left the package inside, but couldn't get the garage closed and just left it open. It wasn't a big deal because I was home but could have been all sorts of trouble if I hadn't been.",1,1,2020-7-29,1,0,1
I have been looking for garage door integration when Amazon offered this unit to use with their My Key feature.  It's awesome not having to worry about my packages being left on the step and stolen.  The ease of connecting this to my network was a breeze.  I still have not been able to connect to alexia and really dont want to use a skill where anyone can open the door with their voice.,5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"very good product. it is as I have expected and product is as described. setting up with my existing genie garage door opener was not easy and I was getting an err that ""unfortunately learning has completed unsuccessfully. try again or monitor door only?"" but actually it was already set up well. The MyQ ppl should test this product with different garage door opener before putting into market.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"I installed 2 of these devices, they are absolutely wonderful!! One is on a Chamberlain opener and the other is on a genie opener. Both installed the same way. I recommend using the phone app to install, much better instructions and step by step.The alexa option was a little disappointing.  You have to tell alexa to open the myq app and o have yet to be able to get her to do anything but that. Can't get her to open the door to save my life lol",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"It takes a few minutes to install it, but instructions are very clear. You simply register as a user, then follow the instructions on the phone.

I have a 13 yr old opener and it set up perfectly.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Wow, that was easy! I had just gotten home from work last night and amazon had dropped it off a few minutes earlier. I was so excited I didn’t even take my suit off. I got my latter and drill and had it up and running in 15 minutes. And I’m an executive who prides himself on not knowing how to fix a paper jam with the copier. I can’t trust my family to close the garage door (it’s my pet peeve) so I’ve been waiting for a simple solution to this persistent problem. Mission Accomplished!",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"It works with Google Assistant, great! But it doesn't work with Google Home. So if you want all your smart-tools in one Hub like google home. Get something else.Aside from that, it works as intended. You can check your phone app to see if its closed and use it as a remote to open/close it.",2,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
I'm very satisfied with this device. It solved our problem of continually forgetting to close the garage door at night. Thankfully we live in a good neighborhood. Very easy to install. Turns you phone into a remote. Closes door on a schedule. (Best part) Allows operating the door from anyplace. And it's priced right.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"This unit was easy to install and fairly easy to get programmed. There was not a lot of work to it, just a little confusing at first because I tried to install without reading the directions closely. The unit pretty much matched up with everything on its own once I started following directions. It  connected with my Android phone, my wife's Apple phone and our tablets. It was easy to program and set alerts to notify us when the garage door opens and closes. We are very happy with this product and are enjoying the peace of mind knowing the status of our garage door no matter where we are.",5,1,2018-5-3,1,0,0
"Was cautious to buy this considering the bad reviews I saw.But it has been great this first 2 weeks! Quite easy to install (used command strips instead of screws because the hub is pretty light weight). Connected to my WiFi the very first time despite being 2 floors below. Didn’t require any special tools, not even a screw driver with command strips. The door sensor has its own Velcro strips. The step stool was helpful however. App was also simple and intuitive.",5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
This hub works perfectly for my garage door. I have another house that has the Chamberlain garage door openers that are newer and have this technology built in. I liked the ability to access control of my garage doors instantly through my smartphone.. I purchased a second home and the garage door opener was older. I was able to connect this hub easily and now I can control both houses' garage doors. I would highly recommend this product.,5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"So, I've been a big fan of this product quite some time now, but only recently decided to actually procure it. Installation was super easy, functionality was straightforward, and the app/user interface was very simple. So, after weeks of using the MyQ very sparingly, we found ourselves playing in the backyard with our kids. Our 5 year old went inside to get his T-Ball bat, and for some strange reason decided to lock the back door on his way outside. So there we were with no house key or any other way of gaining access to the house. It was then that I glanced at my Apple Watch (I left my iPhone in the house as well) and located the MyQ app. Thanks to MyQ, I was able to open the garage door, jump the backyard fence, and regain entry to our house. I don't do a lot of reviews, but when I thought about how bad this situation could have been without MyQ, I figured that the least I could do was submit a review on it.I highly recommend this product to anyone who leaves their keys and smartphones inside while playing in the backyard with their young children.",5,1,2019-3-16,1,0,0
"Setting up through the app was a hassle, I had to repeat the process 4x to finally get the hub to connect to my garage.It doesn’t always work. You cannot continuously open and close your garage. Sometimes I’m outside and I want to open my garage but the app says that my garage is already open.",2,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
I bought this over thanksgiving since I got it on a deal. It was quick and easy to install. Took me about 15 minutes to install the whole things. It works great. I am able to control my garage door with my phone now. You can also set up various alters on your phone and it will send you alerts if the garage is open. The only reason I am giving it a three start is because the app UI could be improved a little bit and it does not integrate well with google home. I would be giving it a five start if it could be controlled seamlessly with google home.,3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
Installed with a Chamberlain belt garage door opener.  I followed the online videos for the installation.  Everything was exactly as described and installed in minutes.  I used it for our first Amazon Key delivery yesterday.  We were away and didn't want the package to sit outside for a night so we had it delivered to the garage.  The integration was great and saved me from having to ask a neighbor to grab the box from our side door.,5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Worked well with my original Chamberlain, but then its belt broke and a replacement belt was almost as much as a new Genie, so I went with a new Genie.  The My Q doesn't work with the new Genie at all.  Although it does still send me a message when the  door opens.  It was also a pain to program and I don't care for the mounting bracket.",3,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"I've had this product for ~2 months.  It took me an hour and half to sync it with my garage opener.  Just when I was about to give up, it worked.  During that process, I read the instruction manual from cover to cover trying to debug the problem.  I have to say, the word ""UNIVERSAL"" in the product description is misleading.  One page 1 of the user manual it gives you a link to the garage opener compatibility list.  So it does not work with ANY garage opener.  This is the main reason for my 3-star rating.That said, it works as advertised after the painful installation.  So I decided to keep it.",3,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"Easy to install. Not easy to keep “online”. Continually goes “offline” despite several calls to my internet provider and to MyQ (Chamberlain) company. Both were basically helpless. Also, no refund of replacement of item from Chamberlain unless purchased directly from them. Not a user-friendly device. Poor customer service with Chamberlain. However, this review does not reflect my experience with Amazon. The device is now believed to be defective and Chamberlain was subpar with their troubleshooting and customer service.",1,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"I have two garage openers, one LiftMaster and one Chamberlain B500.  They both work nicely with the MyQ hub.  Installation/setup was pretty easy and quick.  I didn't even need a separate door sensor for my B500.  Mobile app is also great with notification.  Alert texting is almost instantly as garage door is opening or closing.  You can also schedule to open/close at anytime.  Me like!",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Relatively easy to install and get working with the myQ app.  However, I bought this for IFTTT and/or custom smarthome integration.  Due to ""security and safety reasons"", I'm not allowed to use this to open my door.  But I can close my door with it.  Yep.  All the functionality is there, but simply not allowed.I pointed out that they would readily allow/enable a random person from Amazon (UPS, etc.) to open my door but not me.  The online chat agent wasn't allowed to acknowledge this flaw in reasoning.",2,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"Surprised to find that garage door opener in my new house was compatible with this technology.  I have left the door open in the past and was interested in remote status and control. Very easy to set up.  In 5 minutes, it was up and running.  I have a schedule to automatically close every night as a safeguard.  I like the notifications whenever the door opens or closes too.  I am considering Amazon key for deliveries now.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
We first purchased this device when I was pregnant and constantly had pregnancy brain and couldn’t remember if I closed the garage door. At first I thought it was a bit excessive but now I can’t live without it! Such great peace of mind knowing that my garage door is closed especially on busy mornings when I’m rushing out the door. The added bonus is that you can open and close from the app anywhere! Great device!!,5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"I bought this product to help overcome interference problems we have at night from outdoor light outside of our garage that uses LED bulbs. I have to say that I'm thoroughly confused about all the other reviews that claim this product is hard to setup up as I had this up and running in probably less than 15 mins (and that includes mounting the receiver to my garage ceiling as well). Prior to using this product, at night, we would often have to get out of the car and manually enter in our garage code on the keypad to get it to go up being that our garage door opener transmitters were blocked by the LED lights outside of our house. Being that we live in Pittsburgh, PA where it is almost always raining and/or in the Winter months it's snowing, sleeting, etc... it's utterly WONDERFUL to be able to use this product from our iPhones where we no longer have to get out of our cars. This is especially helpful now that we have a baby as well. Overall, this is a great product that works as it says it does and was the solution to a problem that I've been struggling to find for about 4 years now. My next step would have been to either change the garage door opener itself to a WiFi unit, or the outdoor lighting which would have been a considerably higher expense than this product.The only extremely small feedback that I might pass back to Chamberlain is some way of being able to disable the alerting beeps when closing the door as a 1-time thing. Meaning, I get why it flashes its lights and beeps loudly, which is to alert anyone who might be under the closing garage door to get out of the way if you're not within line of sight when you use the app to close the door. However, if you're actually in the garage itself, and want to use the app to close the door, (and perhaps you have a sleeping baby you want to sneak into the house), disabling the loud beeping would be clutch.",5,1,2018-12-28,1,0,0
"So far it has been a great addition.  The only problem I had was pairing the hub with my Liftmaster garage opener.  After trying it several times, I decided to erase all of the codes on the opener and then it paired within seconds.  Overall works great.  I park my vehicle in the driveway and I didn't want someone to be able to steal the remote out of my truck and have access to my house.  I also like the feature of being able to schedule the door to close at a certain time every night just in case someone left it open.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I bought from this seller cuz its offered lower price than a new unit from Amazon. It arrived with a tampered door sensor; it never worked.I decided to pay postage and return the defective unit to the Seller; as of today, the refund is still outstanding. I will not recommend this seller cuz he/she should have inspect the unit before shipping to customer.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I set this up with an iPhone and a Linear opener and it literally took less than 20 minutes to get it to work. This was a painless process and the app led me right through the installation. Works like a champ - very happy!The only downside is once I got it working, the car remotes and the built in remote in my Ram stopped working. I just re-paired the remotes and everything was back to normal.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,0,0
"Set up couldn't have been much easier.  I set up three additional (max) users to have access to the device.  App via your phone shows if door is open, closed and how long it's been in its current state (open 10 minutes, closed 5 hours, etc).  Fancier stuff out there but this one fits the bill for me and was inexpensive.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"This is super easy to install and use.  The only problem is the beeping when you close the garage door with the app.  It is extremely loud and goes on for way too long.  The first night I found a Youtube video and saw how to take the speaker out so it doesn't make noise.  The beeping is a safety feature, but I don't know any garage door that is so quite that I need  a warning it is closing.  It is so loud I was worried about the neighbors across the street having a problem with the sound. But with the speaker removed, this is a great garage opener I definitely recommend.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I have been using this product for a week now. Installation was relatively quick and easy after watching a fellow user explain the process. Took me about 30 minutes total to connect everything and have it installed. Since I got this product for $30, I think it was well worth the price. Just the other day my wife had forgotten to close the garage on the way to work and I was able to use the app which notified me that the garage was open, and close it while I was away from home. Keep in mind when using this that there is a loud beeping noise with a flashing light when activated, which is a safety feature to alert if anyone is nearby. Overall, I have had no issues thus far and I would recommend this to anyone looking to be able to have remote access to their garage!",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,1
"I bought the system a few months ago. But as soon as I installed the app for my wife as well the system didn’t function properly!

In short useless system!",1,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
Wow super easy to install and works likes a champ. The app is great too. I have one garage door with WiFi installed and then added the hub to the other garage door and both work the same with the same app. Took me about 15 minutes to install. Followed the instructions in the app to a T. The price is right too.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
Easy to install and calms the wife when she freaks about whether the garage is shut or not. The notifications from the app are nice. Now my wife gets an alert on her phone the second I get home for work so she can assign me a task immediately. So that’s great.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,1,0
This is the best little application to ensure our garage door is closed without the hassle of going and looking!  It has given me a break from listening to my wife worry and ask if the garage door is closed.  It was pretty easy to install.  Took about a half hour.  We have it set up to email or text us if the door stays open for more than a certain amount of time. With the application we can close the door remotely too!  So worth the time and would definitely recommend this to others.,5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"While I had initial issues with this product, it ultimately ended up not being the part's fault. My garage door opener's logic board was slowly dying, and this caused the part to act like it would not pair with my opener.

"The device was very easy to install.  I installed the primary unit and two garage door units in about 20 minutes.  The unfortunate thing that I realized is that I cannot control the opening of a door without going directly to the MyQ app.  Meaning if I want to have the door open when I get close to the house or open the door through another app, this is inherently not allowed.  I can close the door through other apps (i.e. IFTTT) but not open.  I am sure the legal team at Chamberlain is very concerned about this risk however there should be ways around this if this is what the end user wants.  Also, I have signed up for Amazon Key but cannot seem to figure out how to get the drivers to start using this.  Any tips would help.",3,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"Easy to install (really well done on the set up instruction in the app), but the product does not work reliably.

"Was able to install in less then 10 minutes, there is some drilling required. Tools you will need: Drill with drill bit, hammer, screwdriver, rubbing alcohol and a towel. Would also recommend syncing with your garage door opener before you mount. Have been using it for a few months now and love it. No more turning around to make sure the garage door was shut. Simply pull out my phone and check the status of the door, if it was left open then it can be closed from anywhere with the app. Extremely helpful for the forgetful and worrying types!",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0

This is a rip-off because it doesn’t cost them anything for me to link devices within my home.  And yet they somehow think I should pay these subscription fees.  No thanks and buyers be advised if you want to also link devices,  you should be aware of this hidden fee system which Liftmaster tried to trap you into paying.

Especially when Echo auto comes out, it would be nice to say “Alexa, I’m home” and my garage opens, lights turn on, AC turns down and my tv turns on. If Chamberlain would make this integration a reality it would make this a near perfect device. Hence the reason for the rating. Also if you have a Genie Powerlift model it’s a little complicated to get it set up. I had to contact Chamberlain support to get my device set up. 5 stars for their support. They were very helpful and walked me through step by step.",4,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

Unfortunately there is no ""cloudless"" option so If your Internet access is disrupted for any reason, storm, a construction company accidentally cuts the fiber in your area, unreliable ISP, etc; your MyQ system will not work.  This could be easily remedied by allowing the smartphone app to open & close the door when both the phone and hub are communicating via the homeowner's WiFi.

Never worry again about forgetting to close your garage door. The app works really well. You can remotely allow guests to enter.

During the installation the hub would not connect with the garage door (Craftman). Their support told me the hub must be between 5 and 8 feet and it was 19 feet.

The phone app will send notifications when the garage is open and that is exactly what I wanted.,4,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
Does a great job letting me know if the garage door was left open through notifications from the app. Allows me to close the garage directly from my phone even though I have a different opener. I can also know history like when it was last opened and how long it's been closed for. Works great!,5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"Have 3 garage door openerss, 2 craftmans and a Genie... it installed fine with the Craftsman, but could not with the Genie... no matter how many times and variations I tried.

"My wife is always nervous about the car remotes being left in the car, especially if they are getting serviced or left outside. She is not a fan of programming the remote into the car's 3 home link device. So this is the answer. I first had a chamberlain garage door opener so I was all set getting the myQ. It was to my surprise that I was able to continue to use it when we moved and now have a Linear garage door opener. myQ is compatible with a lot of brands, research to make sure yours will work but it does not need to be a Chamberlain garage.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0

Simple install of a couple screws into the garage ceiling.

Once you get the App going this is an absolute cake walk. I have 2 openers a newish MyQ door and an older overhead door (I think its a rebranded genie) The hardest part about the setup was getting the ladder out.

I installed the new unit, and this time the smart hub would not learn my garage frequency and would not open/close.  I decided to use the first smart hub and the second door sensor together, and this did the trick.  Seems like some units are just lemons and you may need to keep ordering replacements until you get a working smart hub and door sensor.I've had this installed for two months and has worked flawlessly with one exception.  I initially installed the hub on the ceiling as recommended, and this would sometimes not open my Genie Intellicode garage opener.

Complete fail.In addition, even if it did not have this major functional and safety defect - it has very poor smart home integration.  Does not integrate directly with Alexa.  Best you can do is link to IFTTT (free for now but usually they charge a subscription fee), and create a routine so you can use voice commands to open the door.  Cannot use Alexa to open the door (ironic when it opens randomly on its own!).",1,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
Very easy to install from my perspective. No issues connecting and programming 2 sensors for 2 doors. The app promoted me and it worked great to program the 2 sensors. So far it works great and I like the alerts. I also purchased this to have in garage delivery but my items still get put in front of my door so not sure what the point of signing up for that service is. False advertising? Delivery people don’t care?,4,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"my old house had a wifi enabled garage door opener and we honestly got spoiled.. not wanting to spend the money to replace the existing unit in my new home that works fine, I bought this.

"Seamless easy install.  Download the App, follow the directions and you're ready to go.  Setting up a schedule to close the door at a specific time is great.  No more forgetting to close the door at night.  The App notifications on your phone is helpful too.  Don't let the comments about subscription or fees sway you.

"Install took all of 20 minutes - mostly time spent finding something high enough for me to reach my garage ceiling.  Only issue I had was that my opener had a purple BUTTON but said orange on the unit.  Had to try both in order to get it to work - but that's not the hub's fault.  I was able to share it out to my kiddos so they can bring their bikes in when coming home from school - which was the entire reason I got it.  I even get a notification to tell me when the door opens, so I know they're home.  For someone new to home automation, this worked great.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I found it fairly easy to install. Programming it was a breeze. Once set up has worked consistently. I did put it on Amazon for package delivery and that has worked well so far.

"This is so convenient. I purchased this at a discount on Amazon when a bike was stolen due to a roommate leaving garage door open.

"Do NOT buy this if you want to connect to Google Assistant or a Google Home. They charge $10/year for that functionality. On top of that, you can't even tell Google Assistant to open the garage door. Basically, the Assistant will only tell you if there door is closed and to close the door for you if it is open.

this garage opener was fairly quick & easy to install - the step by step instructions & available videos etc were helpful. It worked well after setting it up but the next day I was having a terrible time getting it to respond - especially trying to close the garage. I was ready to send it back thinking I didn’t want to deal with something unreliable but happened to read a review that suggested turning the unit around 180 degrees in the mount which I did and it’s worked perfectly since! I’ve been really happy with it and it’s made my life so much easier since my traditional garage remotes were having trouble shutting my garage unless in very close range. I also really appreciate the door sensor that tells you if it’s open or shut just for peace of mind.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
Highly disappointed in this product. Installed it as directed by the videos in the app and more than half the time it tells me my garage door is open when it's not. Have had to reset it up already because it was dead in the water saying the garage was opening but it wasn't. They say you get what you pay for but $20 to open and close my garage 3 times... not worth it.,2,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

"I'm nowhere near handy, but the hub is indeed super easy to install. The video guide inside the app helps you step by step. I've been using it for a few weeks now and it's always been working in terms of triggering open/close on the phone. Sometimes it can be a little slow though, but still it's reliable. I haven't figured out a way to add an iOS shortcut though, so I'll just need to open the app every time. It probably works with Google assistant, and it has the integration in the app, but it doesn't work for me, and a Google search is telling me it's not possible to add it to Google home, so this is not that great. That being said, it's still worth the money.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

My husband installed the my q about 5 months ago and we just got an email that it needs a new battery?!

"This was my 2nd unit in 24 hours as the first one which I ordered new turned out to be used.  Amazon quickly sent out a replacement unit which was new.  Very easy to set-up, but disappointed that MyQ can only be linked to one account, i.e. if you want to allow multiple users to have access to the garage door opener, then you have to share your personal userid and password.  This is bad from a security perspective!  Hence knocking off two stars.",3,1,2018-6-9,1,1,0
"I often panic driving away asking myself “did I close the garage door”? Not anymore with real time messages and status.  Also like the Key by Amazon feature, no more boxes vulnerable to porch pirates, it works very well! Added bonus I can open the door remotely if I need to even with my Apple Watch! Was super easy to install and pair with my craftsman garage door opener. Can’t go wrong for $35 when amazon gives you a $30 credit when using Key for the first time!",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0

"Easy to follow instructions for pairing with existing (compatible) garage door openers.  Followed the instructions and was able to pair it on the first and tested opening and closing it several times before mounting the hub without any issues.  Not using Alexa or IFTTT features - basic open and close features are good enough.As other reviews have noted, the safety features are a bit excessive.  The flashing light is not a problem but the ear piercing alarm is loud and continues to go off for longer than seems necessary.",5,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0

"It works well for me. I have a detached garage and w/ my wifi extender, it picks up the signal w/o problem. I know sooner or later, it will lag and/or not give me an quick response (just as with my security system).

"The system is easy to install and set up. Interface is simple and intuitive, and when working correctly is provides a satisfying experience. However, I can not recommend this based on the widely reported faulty door sensor and poor customer service.Soon after installation, I noticed the auto-close feature was improperly functioning. I have it set to close at 10pm in case I left it open. Apparently the sensor doesn't report if the door is already closed and attempts cycle it anyway, so the door opens. Then for some reason closes again. So now every night at 10pm I have a screeching alarm going off and cycling it open and closed.",3,1,2018-10-25,1,0,0

Installation was a breeze. I went step by step, had no problems, and the app was closing the door in less than 15 min from the time I started. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. The only thing I do not like is the alarm that sounds when you use the app to shut the door. It's obnoxious and I don't not see the point. They should have a disable/mute feature for that. Otherwise great product for the price!",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0

Would be better if it worked with Alexa but I’m hearing that is going to happen soon.Also I live in New England , it’s been cold lately and seems the switch inside the door sensor freezes because for hours in the morning it says door open when it’s really closed . Then after the sun is on the garage a while it goes back to being closed again .",4,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"No more wondering if you closed the garage door!!  Easy to install and great app functionality.  I would highly recommend this device.

There are several helpful YouTube videos that will make it even easier to install.",5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0

It's magic.",5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
"I love the end result. The problem was getting there.  The instructions could include more scenarios. It’s like these were written from their R&D facility without real life testing.  For me and probably only me, I finally, strangely found that turning the device 190 degrees towards the house, away from the garage door, towards my WiFi extender cleared all issues. I had to figure that out myself. I could not understand why the thing would connect and drop connection immediately.  Turning it kept connection.  It just needs to help customers out more. Be prepared for struggles. Maybe you’re lucky and WiFi connectivity is perfect with no issues. More power to you.  But this was my finding. But after those struggles, I do like the product.",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"The install was pretty straight forward.  Took about 20-30 minutes, and the app guided us through it no problem.  Have had it operational for about a week now and it has worked flawlessly.

Like that you can integrate older non WiFi Chamberlin/Liftmaster products. We just moved and wanted to upgrade our home to a Smart one.Don’t place too close to the actual garage door unit.  A couple of feet away works much better. Use a separate electrical Receptical  from the one used for the garage door opener.,5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"Installation was easy, particularly with the in-app installation videos and graphic depctions. Sure wish Chamberlain would include Alexa integration, but the app makes monitoring the status of my garage door extremely easy and user-friendly.  My boys arrive home from school shortly before I arrive home, but I've programmed the Chamberlain app to let me know when they arrive home, and to be sure they close the door (I'm not paying to heat the whole neighborhood ya know!) behind them.  If they fail to do so, I'll close it up behind them in a snap. So simple.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0

"Cool idea but horrible waste of time and execution.Edit: Tried this again due to it being on sale and finally got it to work using an iPhone. App seems to work but the setup took over an hour and two different attempts to pair. The beeping it makes when closing is really obnoxious and long but I think that can be fixed with some modifications. So far, I'd give it 3/5 with some annoyances on the setup. Will update if anything changes.",3,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
The install was flawless.....  I have an older Craftsman Opener (late 90's) and it was easy to install and worked right away.  Ended up having to reprogram my car remote afterwards but that was no problem.  I love the alerts I get but you can turn that off if you don't want to get notices.  I am very happy with the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"The product works as expected except for the really annoying beeping sound whenever you shut the door using the mobile app.  The sound is for safety purposes, similar to the sound of a truck backing up, but the sound is too loud and the duration is way too long - my neighbors down the block do not need to know that I'm shutting my garage door.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
Update: If you live in area the allows Amazon Garage Delivery this is a must. I still stand by my comments below about the IFTTT integration but if you don't need any of that this is a solid way to add smarts to your garage door.The product works fine if you only want to use the MyQ App but If you want to automate opening the door you are out of luck. IFTTT integration is poor. Chamberlain removed half the functionality from the integration which makes the unit not worth hooking up. Also you have to pay a subscription fee to fully unlock the integration which doesn't add geofencing or the ability to open the door automatically.,3,1,2018-11-29,1,1,0
To make your garage smart does not get any easier than this. I tried the Amazon Delivery in my garage and worked great. I added a old camera in the garage to make sure all was good and delivered properly and it was. I love this option. You could by a MYQ camera also to Intergrade with the opener if wanted.  great product for an older garage opener.,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I have a compatible Craftsman garage door opener (with an orange button).  However, the myQ device is unable to pair with the opener despite following pairing instructions to the letter.  No matter how I many times I reoriented the device, it will not pair.  I sat the myQ hub at the top of the opener enclosure to check if it is just a distance issue, but the result was the same.  I gave it two stars because it recognizes the door if it is closed or open.  I want to return it but I no longer have the return button in my order page.  I bought this during the Amazon prime week but was only able to have time to set it up two months after.  So disappointed it will not work as advertised.",2,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0

That’s all I need it for.",5,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
Liked the key from Amazon since always using but not offered in my area yet and can’t control with Alexa without a myQ bridge. It is still handy I guess to know when door is open or closed but would not have purchased not being able to use either of those if I would have known.,5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
This was an easy install and works exactly how I'd hoped it would. I bought this for the convenience of opening the door from my phone so I don't have to leave an opener in my truck which is parked in the driveway.The only bad thing it's the subscription they want you to pay to pair it with anything other than their own app. I have no use for paying it with my Amazon Echo so not a huge deal but this may be for other users.,5,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0
This was incredibly easy to set up and I can control my garage from outside the WiFi zone. Bought it because typical me - 10 minutes into my commute I always think “did I close the garage?” And I thought this would basically tell me the garage was closed but ALAS I can close my garage if it’s open.It says it needs good WiFi in the garage. It doesn’t. I get like super minimal WiFi and it works. It says you need to put the hub close to the garage door opener. You don’t. Mine is on the wall probably 15 ft away and it works fine. Also didn’t mount it to the wall yet because I don’t yet own a drill. So yeah. It’s great.,5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"Pretty simple to install. Nice guided walkthrough. Absolutely atrocious smart home integration through Google Assistant. You have to ask Google assistant to ""Talk to MyQ"" instead of adding service through the Home accounts management page. Full linking of service (that doesn't even allow you to open your garage with your voice!) requires activation of a currently free premium subscription that's soon to be $10/yr. As of 11/04/19 the activation link for this subscription leads to a login page that errors out at a 500 internal server error page! Effectively broken right now. The only thing this item does correctly is open and close the garage door through the app. That's it. Even at the sale price I wholeheartedly do not recommend.",2,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
This was very easy to install and set up on our garage door opener.  It works great but we have had some odd issues like the app reporting the door is open or closed when it is not.  Usually opening or closing the door with the switch on the wall resolves it but it is still annoying.  Without that issue this would be 5 stars.,4,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
Like the ease of installation. Was easy to set up and has been working great!!!

"Chamberlin could be much more upfront about the capabilities with this device.  It does not function as a smart home appliance like a light or mini plug or something, it works through a google assistant service.  So in order to use the voice functions, you need to ask GA to talk to MyQ, and then myq can tell you if the doors are open or closed, and can also close the doors for you.  IT CANNOT OPEN THEM.  This appears to be a policy decision made by MyQ, for whatever reason, I dont know.  It will not appear in your Google Home list as a device.

"Easy to connect and install.  Simple app.  Works great.My only complaint is that I wish that the app alerted you if the garage door reversed when closing.  That way you can tell it to try again.

I love this product. I can never remember if I shut the garage door when I leave for work so being able to check on my phone is very nice. We only have one garage opener so it’s nice to be able to just open via the app as well. The piece that mounts in the garage flashes and beeps when you close the door via the app which adds a delay to the closing. This is supposed to warm people to stay away from the door.

"Have a smart craftsman garage door on one side and an older craftsman on the other.  Add this to the older one in about 10-15 minutes.  Now don't need the old falling apart clickers, as this allows control with my cell phone.  The new MyQ app is quicker then the craftsman app they just cancelled, as well.  Love this addition.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
I had a little concern reading the reviews re: installation and remote function. This thing rocks! It resolved my dilemma of worrying about getting locked out. I carefully followed the good instructions and awaited the glitches which never arrived. Not one. Works perfectly.,5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"This control unit works great. It does require WI-FI and I have had very few issues with it. Occasionally the app and the unit has disconnected from each other, requiring a reset after returning home.  Overall it’s a good performing controller and a good way to add control of your garage door when you don’t have a smart garage door opener.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"It's always nice when a product does exactly what you need it for.  This was easy to install and allowed us to extend our smart home to the garage doors.  It's so nice to be able to check on my phone if the garage doors are closed, or get an alert if they've been up too long.  The instructions were simple to follow, worked exactly as they stated and has been very reliable for several months since I installed it.",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
Super easy setup. The instructions are thorough enough and if you do them step by step without getting ahead of yourself it’s foolproof. Ensure your opener is compatible before you buy! Only thing I don’t like: the hub beeps when you close from the app. It’s a safety feature to ensure someone near the garage is aware of the garage door a few seconds before closing but it’s loud and annoying. Safety first!,4,1,2018-4-5,1,1,0
The installation and setup was quick and painless.  It took me about 30 minutes to do everything and that was with about 10 minutes trying to find the screw that I dropped. I was going to do a DIY setup but I couldn’t get it to work. I then found out that I would have to take my control panel off the wall and solder wires on to the board. That was about a month ago and I just wasn’t thrilled about the soldering. I was looking at YouTube and found a video of this unit being installed and decided to do this instead.,5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Install was easy however, about 50% of the time the sensor doesn’t update so the app will say the door is open when it’s closed. Once the error appears you can’t open or close the garage via the app again until you do so manually, so 50% of the time when I get home I need to get out of the car to go inside and open the garage so I can pull in. Also, HomeKit support requires an over priced bridge (which wouldn’t be as big a deal If the sensor worked consistently, but since it doesn’t I’m not willing to shell out. )",2,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0
Easy to install and works great with my phone! Have no issue with the product! But I have an issue with the company for charging extra to use Alexa! So cheap and greedy of them! So disappointed when I realized that i wasn’t able to use it with Alexa! I wouldn’t have bought it if I knew it wasn’t going to work with Alexa!,1,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
Using it will Google Assistant and on MyQ app.  I like the scheduling of closing.  I disliked the beeping to close so I followed a user's advice and screwed in a screw to the speaker.  Ended up breaking the speaker enclosure(black round thing on the board) but the speaker stayed intact.  I now can just barely hear it and it is much better.,5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
Install was a breeze and took me about 45 minutes. Make sure and follow the quick start guide and it's easy. Also make sure you have good WiFi where you mount the control module.  Works like a champ and I love being able to set my own schedules and notifications. Total piece of mind that my kids or elderly mom left the garage door open.,5,1,2018-10-22,1,1,0
"Install is pretty straight forward. Note that you don't really need to install the ceiling, you could put it really anywhere in the garage as long as it connects well to the wifi/internet.  If you download the Key by Amazon app and link accounts for Key in-garage delivery at no extra cost if you're a Prime member - then your packages aren't sitting out on your doorstep to get stolen.",5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
"Works as described! Bought for my husband who always worries if he has closed the garage door. Now, we don't have to turn around every time to double check -- just open the app and save time. Notifications are good too. Notifies me when my kids get home. Controlling from my phone also allows me to open from anywhere.Most convenient when my oldest locks herself out and I'm not home! Overall, great product -- MUCH more affordable than similar smart garage openers.",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
Bought it. Went to install it and wouldn't. Connect. The company that made it didn't put the serial number into it's system. Had to call for them to correct it. After that it hooked right up.

"This door opener arrived on time and packed well for the shipping.  It was easy to install, a little bit tricky to program but I'm not as technologically proficient as I'd like to be so that being said, it must be easy to install if I can do it.  The connectivity can be a bit slow so you need to plan ahead when using it to minimize waiting for it to connect and then sending the open/close command to it.  All-in-all, it's a great option as a universal remote for the garage door.",5,1,2018-8-6,1,0,0
"It takes minutes to download an app. And quickly integrated to my Chamberlain Opener with a single touch of the pairing button, through the app on my phone.Literally completely set up and operational within 3 minutes.

Chamberlian trying switching to the recurrent payments business model and it is not clumsy anymore. They're bending existing customers by forcing all 3rd parties integrations to be purchased via subscription and undoing all existing. I would advise against any of their products this attitude should get them off the market ASAP.,1,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
The unit was a snap to install.  The most time consuming part was drilling two small pilot holes to mount the bracket that the hub attaches to.  The rest of it was very easy.  Took about 15 minutes to have it up and running.  It works fine.  I’ve been able to remotely open the garage door and now have Amazon Key running which will be great for receiving deliveries from Amazon when I’m not home.  Haven’t tried to do the Alexa integration yet.,5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"Not sure that this review is relevant because I was not able to get it to work with my garage door opener (it's Wayne Dalton Quantum 3212 model). I didn't need just 'monitoring', so I opted to go with Meross, which works perfectly. I am also able to bypass third party subscription fee besides getting full functionality.",4,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
Received my MyQ one hour ago and it’s already completely installed. Be link the device before you begin your installation. I watched a few YouTube videos first and it made installation a snap!

So far this is a great product but it omits an ear piercing signal so load and sharp when the garage door opens and closes that I want to rip my ears off. Trust I will be looking for a way to disable the sound but officially there's no way to turn it off. If it had an off sound button I give it a five. Actually I hate to sound so much I'm giving this a two.,2,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"Unit worked great for a few days..... Now it's not functioning because of a ""closing error"" that doesn't exist.  It is indicating a bad sensor, but I assure you that is not the case.  Have also re-paired with no luck. Now it want's me do work it manually because of too many attempts, which is a crock, also. I like the concept, and I really want to solve the problem, but customer support is just a myth with these folks.  Guess I'll keep it a few days in case another buyer has solved the same problem.  After that is is bye bye to this piece of junk.",1,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I gave it two stars because it does work and it’s easy to install, but opening our garage is sooooo slow.  It takes less time to unlock the front door, walk through the house and open it from the inside.  Doesn’t work with homekit without an $80 add-on.  No thanks.",2,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"I no longer need to wonder whether I left the garage door open.  If I did, I can take close it.  This has worked very reliably.  Installation was quick and easy.  It has also had the unexpected secondary benefit of being a sort of burglar alarm - Once the door opened when I did not expect anyone to be home.  I got an alert on my phone.  Turns out it was just my wife, but it's nice to know when the door is opened unexpectedly.",5,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
"It works, is easy to setup and install. When you close the door via app it's a little annoying that it beeps for like 15 seconds before finally closing. Still shocked it doesn't have a feature allowing you to autoclose the garage if left open for X seconds/minutes. Seems like they could add that feature to the app pretty easily so I sure hope they do, then I'd give it 4-5 stars.",3,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
This product is incredible.  Who knew you could run your garage door from your cell phone and it send alerts when opened.  Love this thing.

"It works fine - but the instructions are a little tedious.  You need a decent WiFi signal - my router is in the room next to the garage and that is sufficient.

"The biggest ripoff. They want to force you to pay monthly fee for Alexa and Google Home Voice control support. No way! Installation was kinda okay. Important! It was not the color of the button.

Amazon Key openes MyQ App and like I said, super slow...",2,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
"Super easy to install,  it took me less than 15 minutes including downloading the app and installing the parts. The app walked me through the pairing process and was included in the 15 minutes. I cant stress how easy the installation was. It works exactly as described.  I have mine set up to receive a push message everytime the garage door opens or closes. I also set it up to automatically close in the evening in case I forget to close it. I also like how the app opens right to the door status and opening or closing the door is only one click away. I don't have any complaints  and can't think of anything more I wish it did. No more wondering if I  left the garage door open.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
Excellent addition to our garage operator. Installs in minutes even with an opener with “rolling codes “. Instructions are very well written. It is important to make sure you have a good strong WiFi signal in the garage. A nice safety feature is a bright strobe light that flashes for a few seconds before closing the door.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I park my car outside and don't want to keep a remote in the car.This was easy to install but the ""Quick Start"" instructions are a joke, giving no installation instructions at all.

I bought this unit because of the reviews.  Don't waste your time and money and get something else.This is GARBAGE!!!  I will be standing right outside my garage door and I still can't open it.

Ridiculous!!!!,1,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0

It’s super easy to add another sensor to your MyQ app. It takes like 3 min to setup. My only gripe is it’s a little pricey to add a sensor compared to the price of the main device ($36 for main device and sensor vs $27 for separate sensor only) but not a huge deal.,4,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0

I have it scheduled to close on it's own just incase I forget to close it when I leave in the morning. I am over a block away while driving home and I hit it to open. Always works, haven't had any complaints. I bought a  Google Wifi enhancer for the house, which works wonders. Not just for the garage but, for the whole house. It was just an added perk!

"MyQ Smart Garage Opener is great! I often leave our home and try to decide whether I close the garage or not. This saves the day each time! I am not used to all the other abilities with it, but I hope to learn more about it and use it to its fullest potential.On installation, my brother-in-law gave me the best tip ever. Allow time for you to set it up all in one session. Don’t start, go have dinner, and then try install.  It works just much easier with one segment of time. I had to move a couple of things in my garage to make it happen so all in all it took about an hour.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
The installation is easy and using it is super convenient. I got it as a present for my dad who enjoys tech and a smart home.  It was easy for all of his kids to be able to get in and out of the house when we visit. Just do not use this as the only way to get in and out of somewhere. The app often crashes or just never loads making it hard to use for every day situations. The other small issue I have with it is that when you press it to open or close there is a lag and does not say if you are opening/closing the door. Often at night he checks to see if the door is left open and if it is he often hits the button but due to the lag and lack of being able to see the if it is responding he often hits the button several times making the door open/close several times. Overall the system it great but it is the app that needs work.,4,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
I find their subscription approach to be nothing more than a greedy approach to business. What further development could they develop that is worth fleecing their customers for?

It is a good device.  Owner can know the real status of garage door and history open/close period.Actually It doesn’t need any tool to install.  It is OK to put the device on the top of garage controller.  Most new model garages do not need the door sensor.  So the prince could be lower if the sensor is not included in the package.

Very easy to install as well as getting it functioning. Not many products are compatible with other manufacturers but this one does work as described. Read the critical review and I had no problems with anything the reviewer described but have the same products and I did not replace anything.

"We love this so much we bought a second sensor for the other garage door.  My Wife and I are always on the run and always forget to make sure the garage door is down.

Love this product!! We have only had it for a short time but it has come in very handy several times already. We drove up to pigeon forge and even though it is only a hour drive we decided to stay up there but since we where not planning on staying we didn’t leave a key out for the neighbor to let the dogs out but all I had to do we send her a link to have access for a predetermined amount of time and she could open and close garage door to let them out. We have had friends bring things over and we where not home but I could open and close the garage door for them to drop or pick stuff up. It’s crazy how many times it has come in handy. Not sure how we managed without it in the past.,5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0

Product installed very easy. Seemed like it would be great because I’m always forgetting to close my garage door. I would continuously get an alert that my door was open so I would use my iPhone 11 to close it but got a error message stating that MyQ was off line. I would would contact my neighbor and was told that my door was closed. 30 minutes later it would repeat the whole process. Tech support wasn’t very helpful by telling me that it was a simple glitch.

This helps, but there are two issues.  The app does a great job of walking you through how to set it up.  The first issue is that MyQ took 8 tries to connect to my garage door.  Each try takes about 5 minutes.  It gets tiresome very quickly, especially when it is winter in Minnesota and you are sitting in your cold garage for 40 minutes.  The next issue to connect to your google home is $10 a year.  A pain but I found it worth it.  The issue is that it is not even fully compatible with Google home.

"The installation was very easy and the app controlled the door remotely most of the time, although annoyingly needed manual overrides from time to time. Unfortunately, after updating my home WiFi router to a new Linksys and after may hours of working with Chamberlain and Linksys support, the WPA2 security settings were deemed incompatible. The MyQ was the only device out of 15 smart homes devices that had a problem with the new router. Only solution from Chamberlain was to turn off router’s WPA2 WiFi security, so not viable. MyQ smart hub... Not so smart!! I have to find a different product for my WiFi network.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"Overall, it is a nice product....when it works.  I seem to have too many sensor issues, where i am required to raise or low the door to get it to sync again with the app.  Very annoying.  I don’t know if my sensor is bad, or if this is just how it is.  I am working on getting a new sensor.  The app is very nice.",3,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
I absolutely love this product. I was worried the setup would be confusing or time consuming but it was SO EASY. The setup instructions are done through the app and were so intuitive and easy to follow along. I've never had instructions be so clear as these ones. We also love the app because when we're traveling we can check in on our garage door and make sure it hasn't been opened. We can also add friends to it too so they're able to access our house if needed. Such a great product for such an incredible price!,5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
Super easy to install. Videos included with the app are very helpful. The only reason I’m not giving 5 stars is the unit occasionally loses connectivity to my network even though my router is in the garage. This could be my network and not the device. A very cool solution and works from anywhere!,4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
It took 15 minutes to set up with my Craftsman lift while following the instructions in the MyQ phone application.  It covers nearly all modern US garage door brands and works very well.,5,1,2019-11-20,1,1,0
Had the whole thing mounted and running in less than 10 mins. Running off a Google Wifi system with zero issues. I do dislike the fact you need to pay for google assistant and can't open the door with voice commands. Other than that the system works great and the app works well. I would recommend to anyone who has a decent wifi signal to purchase this kit.,5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
App doesnt work well and I've had to re-sync garage door to device 3 times in 3 weeks. It's useful when working but so far it's been a pain in the butt.

I bought 2 as I have 2 garage doors. Turns out 1 hub unit supports 2 (or more?) door sensors so I have a spare hub if I ever need it. I use it in monitor only mode to alert my phone if I leave a door open for more than (user adjustable) 20 minutes. I also connected it via  ifttt.com to smart wifi light bulb in house to light while either door is open.Each sensor lost contact with hub ONCE in first week at different times. Pressed button on sensor to reestablish. No more problems after that.,5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Saw this deal on amazon. For me first thing is the easy to install part, since I am not very good when it comes to Handman work. Video showed only few steps. With the discounted price , it was a steal. I was little stuck in installation, since I did not followed the entire steps. The door remote HAS TO BE FIXED ON Garage DOOR, before you do the pairing. That was the part, I messed up. I thought, its just a matter of keeping in the range of Hib and it should work but NO, it's the movement of the remote on garage door which it looks for while pairing.But otherwise, it went thru pretty quick. Started using it and now I don't have to go back always rechecking, if the door is open or closed. The app is also very intuitive. I recommended to five of my friends who bought it the very next day.Great product !",4,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0

This is a great feature and tool for your garage.  Have you even left home and wondered if the garage door was still open?  Easy to check on your smart phone app and to add a second person to use the Garage hub.  It shows you if the door is open or closed and the history list shows when it was open or closed and for how long.  You can also have it send you emails if letting you know that the door is open.  It was very simple yo install and the app was essential in setting it up.  A good buy.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

"This item works great on my garage door opener no problems at all and sure beats purchasing a new garage door opener just to have the app and ability to open and close it on the phone.It was very easy to install but beware when your setting up the unit and establishing the connection it will disable all your other remotes including, you’re in car programming so you will have to reset them all again.",5,1,2018-12-14,1,0,0

"This is a snap to install. The hardest part was tracking down the unit’s power cord. Door actuation with the app is pretty good. My garage has good signal from the router, but the app will sometimes just hang. Considering the low price and ease of installation for this aftermarket feature, I am quite pleased with the product. My teenage son is not yet security minded, so would often leave the garage door open overnight.

"Its a great device that was easy to setup and use; we have even used it to its fullest-advantage when we were out of down and needed to let a neighbor inside. The only negative I can think of is how long it takes for the app to load - obviously its not a ""quick-click"" like a traditional garage door opener. Given that, using this as your primary opener might be a little cumbersome unless you open the app as you're pulling up to your house, before you enter the driveway, for example.",4,1,2018-5-3,1,0,0
"The box displays a woman receiving this precise alert: ""Garage remained open at 08:15am."" It's one of the reasons I bought the item—to be alerted if the garage door is open at certain times. Nonetheless, when setting up alerts, I only was given the option to be notified when the garage door is opened, closed or stopped. So, I chatted with support. I told him I wanted to be alerted, like the woman on the box, when the garage door is open, not openED. He said that feature is no longer available. So, if that is important to you, as it is to me, do NOT buy this product.",3,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
Purchased 2 of these for my 2 doors. Neither hub was able to connect. They are sitting within 10 feet of my router. The hub would say they were connected but the app would not.

Garage ceiling plugs full, and we were actually able to simply place hub high on garage wall and have it work on the first try.  Adding this device allows my snowbird mother to open and close her garage door from 500 miles away.

People whining about having to pay for connected services need to get over themselves, the functionality in the app does everything you really need for free.  Those complaining about the lights and alarm, would you rather run over your stupid 3 year old who is screwing around where he shouldn’t be anyways?Wonderful product that works right out of the box.",5,1,2019-3-31,1,0,0
"Installation was fast and I haven't had any issues with it's operation but there is room for improvement.The most glaring issue is the beeping. You can't turn it off via a setting. If you want to stop the beeping your would have to physically hack the device to remove the speaker. This is apparently a safety feature. But the device already requires you to have door sensors, so I don't know why this is necessary. It really limits this to emergency closing only. I wouldn't be able to use this after everyone in the house has gone to bed.",4,1,2018-5-3,1,0,0
"Installation was quite easy, but pairing with my existing system(different brand) was quite bumpy. I almost gave up, but after several attempts it connected ""open"" feature and after repeating all the steps it connected ""close"" feature - a little weird.

"My Amazon one touch buy ordered this for me in my pocket, I wasn't to pleased to see a shipping notification for something I didn't want to buy... But so worth the accidental purchase. Such a simple product that puts your mind at ease every time you forget if you closed your garage or not. It does struggle with my 110 degree weather and bugs out every so often. But that's very minor. I'll probably just get the actual garage door opener later down the road where all the features are built in and that will fix the heat problem.",5,1,2018-8-2,1,1,0
"The best part about this device honestly is the awesome instructions that are built into the app. The only issue I had was with getting it connected WiFi even in a place where other devices connect easily.

"This was an awesome addition to my home tech.  It was incredibly easy to install for two garage doors (on Chamberlain, one Craftsman).  Has worked without a flaw.  Have had no issues with my router (5GHz Netgear orbi) that some have reported.  Highly recommend!  Only thing that is odd is that a second sensor costs more than the hub and sensor together.

"I like this hub and the sensor. It is easy to install and to set up with the application on the phone. It have saved me a lot time and given me the peace of mind.

The install was simple and quick. I opened the app and followed the instructions and in about 15 minutes had it up and operating. The setup was simple and the door has worked to perfection. I can highly recommend this item if you are looking for remote access to you garage door.The only down side is the loud beeping when closing the garage door. I understand the safety reason but my door has the safety sensor so that it won't close if the beam is broken so I don't see the need for the loud beeping. It would be nice to have the option to silence it or at least turn it down.,5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"This is an amazing additional feature for our garage. It works perfectly. We wanted something to alert us to the garage door being open, without buying a surveillance system.

We can close it and be alerted to its status clear across the world...it is a must have..",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"Loved the idea of this item. I bought it and it arrived quickly from Amazon. It connected to my home wi-fi and the device sync'd to the motor on my LiftMaster opener.

"Works great on my Chamberlain Whisper Plus opener that is around 7 years old. Like other reviewers, found the instructions to be ok. I made a couple mis-steps early with programming but just kept at it and tried again. There is likely a Youtube video tutorial from someone that would be helpful. Once I made it to the MyQ setup wifi page on my droid device, things came together nicely. My second issue was that my opener had two buttons near the ""learn"" button area, and I pressed the wrong one a couple times first as I reached around blindly to press it (car was still in garage). Be patient and you can set up in 30 minutes or so, mounting included. I think the interface is good, but could be jazzed up visually some. It does what it needs to afterall. Expect that may get better through future updates. So far, very pleased with function and alerts sent to me letting me know when it opens and closes. Very cool add on.",5,1,2018-1-4,1,1,0
I’m not very technologically savvy but this was very simple to install for me. We lost both remotes to the garage door so this is a great substitute AND we can take it when we move to the next place. I was also able to open the garage for access into my home once for my 7 year daughter when I was late getting home for her bus. Not the best solution but I was glad I had that option vs her being outside on the porch!,5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"We bought this guy to automate the opening and closing of the garage door for my wife. Long story short, unless you pay for their subscription service, you cannot integrate with IFTT to automate the closing. Automate the opening? Absolutely not. Chamberlain has said no, because security. Wish I hadn’t ever bought it now. I guess I don’t return it because I hope they will release the “open” operation. I wouldn’t buy it again.",2,1,2019-6-23,1,0,0
"Installation was pretty simple and it worked on first try. After a couple of days it would only work half of the time. Not reliable. I tried everything. Changed its position, reconnected, restarted.

Very easy to install. Took about 30 minutes. I bought this product so I would not have to wonder if I closed the garage door.  I get notifications on my phone every time the garage is open or closed. You can also make unique alerts for example - if the garage is open for a certain amount of time. You can remotely open/close your garage from the app. It does everything that is says it does. An added plus is it works with amazon key - amazon can now deliver my packages into my garage safe and sound. I do not  have to worry about them being left on my front porch.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"We installed this according to the instructions received and set it up to work with our Alexa devices. It never worked; Alexa always thought the garage door was open.

It showed up as closed when the door was open and open when the door was closed.",1,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"This is a cost-effective and highly functional solution to manage your garage door remotely. I love that. However the setup process was full of errors (I had to take to online forums to figure out what to do. The workaround ended up being easy, but it didn't come from Chamberlain but rather other frustrated users like me. Chamberlain should address this.). Also the inability to have multiple user profiles is a big miss. You have to use the same login across multiple devices if you want multiple people to control the door. No way to see the history or get a notification based on who is opening or closing the door.",3,1,2018-11-14,1,0,0
"Cheap enough, fairly easy install, although the door sensors are kind of obtrusive. The beeping before closing is super obnoxious and unnecessary. I put tape over the speaker to mute it. That helps some. Lack of Alexa integration is why I’m giving it one star.",1,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I waited until after the myQ arrived and was configured, to order this, so this came separately. If you buy the MyQ, note that it only comes with one door sensor.

Now both doors are remotely controllable from my iPhone.",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

I got this thing and installed it pretty quick, followed online instructions on chamberlain website and got it up and running in less than 5 minutes. i'm able to open and close the doors on demand from my android phone, and works everytime.",5,1,2017-11-27,1,2,0
After 1 year of using it in my garage I can say this smart garage sensor is well worth the price for it. The product is very small and not bulky since I didn’t want to replace my whole entire garage hub for a smart garage unit. By installing this device I get a inexpensive smart garage . The only issue was if your new to this it can be a bit complicated for a beginner to install. So far it’s working great and my whole family loves it.,4,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I ran into zero problems with install. I set it up on my existing garage WIFI extender. I stayed on that WFI Ext during setup on my iPhone. I now get notications on Alexa, iPhone and Apple Watch. Also, I scheduled it to close every night at 2200 hours. I'm happy that our garage-door has become part of our expanding Smart Home. I was not compensated to promote, nor am I a bot. I am just impressed and a fan. All at an incredibly low price.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"The installation went smoothly. tested the product several times to ensure that it works. The next day, the garage opens on its own multiple times within several hours. my phone was not being used at all. When I tried to use it, it gave me an error. I factory reset the product and went through the installation one more time. It works fine again. On the next day, the garage door opens on its own again and because I wasn't home, it remained open for over four hours! I got infuriated and wrote to the company support twice and still have not heard back when it's been over a week. I've had enough; will not take any more risks.",1,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"I had no issues setting it up. I followed the instructions and it all worked perfectly. My one problem is you can not set a schedule to open the garage, only close it.

"I had the system (2 doors) up and running in less than 20 minutes. Their app makes it very easy. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would really appreciate a better indication in the app that the door is moving. As it is, you have to wait for a while to be sure the door responded. It would also be nice to bypass the sign-on screen on my secured iPhone.

Bought 3 weeks ago. It already reminded me to change the battery.  The battery came with the product.  Is it a battery problem or this product ate the battery so quickly?

"Took me 20 min to install, and it worked right away. The package had the hub and one door sensor. I have Chamberlin openers on all 3 garage doors, so I ordered extra door sensors for my other 2 doors. Each additional door sensor takes at least 2 minutes to add (in other words, no problem at all). I see other folks on here complaining about all that Chamberlin doesn't tell you. But from my experience, these worked exactly as advertised and do exactly what I need -- allow me to open/close doors remotely, and allow me to enable in-garage delivery from Amazon Prime.",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
Love that I can check the status of the door from anywhere.  Somewhat difficult to set up but if you follow the directions to the letter it works.  I kept getting error 101 which there is no code to explain.  I found that the battery on the door sensor was not making contact because the plastic strip that you are instructed to remove tore off and left the battery  not making contact .  One that was resolved the error code cleared.,4,1,2018-7-15,1,0,0
"I like the product and am glad that I bought it, That said: My first device arrive with problems. The tech spent the time trying to find out the problem but without any hesitation sent me a new one the next day. It worked perfectly. Now to the software. I am still a bit shaky about relying on it but I do not think that it is the fault of the device. I do not subscribe to data so when I am off site the software does not work. Not sure that it is a problem with the device or me.I would love to have a unique signal when to device is accesses. All in all, I need to play around and experiment more to be sure that I am not the problem.",2,1,2017-11-21,1,2,0
Does NOT work with HomeKit despite being the first one that comes up on the search. And closing the garage door remotely triggers a very annoying loud beep for about 5 seconds and doesn’t stop until the door is closed all the way.,1,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"Wish I had done more research.  At the time of this writing, June 2020, this product does not support the command ""open the garage door"" in Google Assistant.  It is also misleading to say that this supports Google Home: It only integrates with Google Assistant which is not the same thing.  Home automation is confusing enough, they should be more clear.  On the plus side, installation and setup using the myQ app was very easy up to the point of integrating with Google Assistant, which took a little more effort.",1,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

"This was very easy to install and it only took me a few minutes.  There's no free plug near my opener, so I just put the hub on a shelf on the garage wall near a plug and it works fine from there.  The sensor just sticks onto the garage door, so that was very easy too.  Now when I leave the house and forget whether or not I closed the door, I can check and fix it without turning around and going back home - which I have done many times.

"Love the simplicity and functionality.  Have the app installed on both an iPhone and Android (Blackberry).  No problems installing the app and integrating the myQ devices to control two garage doors with a single gateway.However, I discovered a challenge and figured out the solution after consulting several home automation blogs.  If the myQ gateway is installed too close to a garage door opener, the opener interferes with the functionality of the gateway in sending alerts.  The door would close and it would take 30-45 minutes for an alert to be received.  When I repositioned the gateway so it is about 5-6 feet from the opener, alerts are sent immediately.",5,1,2018-4-18,1,0,0

Sadly does not work with Alexa without an additional service. But work excellent with the MyQ app. Can control it from anywhere.

The MyQ garage door opener is a fantastic buy at the $50 sale price on Amazon.  The installation was extremely easy and straight forward.  I had it up and running in under an hour.  So far it has operated flawlessly and the notifications to your smart phone I have found useful.  You can set a schedule to close it at a certain time of day but you cannot set it to close automatically after so many minutes of being left open. That is one area I see that could be improved.

My neighbor turned me on to this product and so far it saved me twice. It’s better then giving a key out and or lock boxes.

"I was looking for a solution when the security company said our garage door was TOO smart to configure with their software. As a previous owner of the Chamberlin doors I was familiar with the product and found this solution during Prime Day, so it was a bonus buy! Easy to setup and install, from the time I opened the box until I put the ladder away was a whopping 10 minutes.

"This is an incredible concept. You can open your garage door from anywhere. The only issue I had was that no one tells you you have to tap the icon TWICE to open or close the garage door. If you press it once it will not work. That being said, the directions are terrific. You can follow a video that will take you through each step. They have great phone support if you need it.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"I got this to use with my Chamberlain garage door opener about a year ago.  Pairing was successful the first, second, third, and fourth times.  You will have to pair it with your garage door opener again and again, every time the network goes down and sometimes for no reason at all.  You'd think that a device with such a simple task would be way more stable.  The app has beed updated at least three times and it's still a coin flip as to whether it will operate in the morning when I leave for work and another coin flip in the afternoon when I return.  IFTTT integration requires a paid subscription.  All in all they tricked me into spending $50 for a pain in the but.  Not worth it!",1,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0

This review would have been five stars if the shortcut would have worked at all.",4,1,2018-6-22,1,0,0
I lost the remote to my garage a while back and also the replacement after that. Being able to use this device from my phone has been a lifesaver. I like that multiple users can access it as well and the notifications are very useful. It has only lost connection to the WiFi a couple of times and resetting the modem and router easily fixed the issue. I would definitely recommend this product!,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
It was a quick install thankfully.  For the hub I just use a double sided tape and mount it on top of the garage door machine (thereby skipping the drilling hassle).But I agree with done commenters that the alarm and flashing when closing the door is too much.  Let the app say “Door closing” in a sultry female voice  at least twice would be more than enough.,4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"The communication between the hub, sensor, and app is awful.  The garages will be closed and the app will say they are open which is frightening if you arent at home and dont have a camera in your garage to verify.  Additionally, they may say they are closed when they are actually open which is a really awful false sense of security.  Occasionally the app will say the doors are closed or open correctly.  This means you can have no trust in the app which defeats the purpose of purchasing this product.  Additionally, the sensors like to ""error"" and then you lose control over the opening or closing feature which requires a physical hard reset.",1,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  I sometimes wonder as I'm down the hill if I remembered to shut the garage door.  This makes it easy.  You just look at the app on your phone.After initial set up the app was malfunctioning on my phone.  I watched the video and a simple relocation of the hub away from the garage door opener unit solved the problem.,5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
This was so simple to install. The MyQ app has amazing ratings on the App Store and is really intuitive and easy to use.

I did call customer service and was assured that it couldn't happen with the frequency that MyQ used. But it did. The add on sensor for a Genie opener was a concern but worked flawlessly. But it also (on 1st opening after linking activated the auto start). Maybe has something to do with the Bluetooth linking 1st time.  Again, hasn't repeated and very happy with it and the app.",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0

She was very helpful and tried to get it online. After about an hour it worked. Notifications weren't working properly on the app. We had to do it on our PC and they still didn't work all of the time. Sent it back the next day. Worse product ever.

After installation, the device would only update the position of the door sensor intermittently, though it would successfully operate the opener.  I decided to factory reset the device and run through the setup process again.  The second attempt at setup went smoothly connecting to my wireless network and to the door sensor, but it would never successfully pair with the opener again.

Getting the latest  technology for remote control management of a garage door without without replacing the garage door motor drive-what's not  to like?

"First, let me start out that I would have given this a 5 star but because it is NOT Apple Homekit ready I docked it down. This had nothing to do with the vendor I bought it from. I am very tech-savvy so I was able to get it to work with Apple Homekit by using Homebridge. If you just google ""install HomeBridge"" you will find all you need if you are technical.The MyQ works flawlessly and I will never have a home without it.

I like this device. It upgraded my garage door so I can close it remotely when I forget as I'm leaving. The app is useful but very basic. It doesn't work with Alexa at this point. It doesn't even have Amazon as a company you can link your account to except; it does have Amazon Key. Only useful if it's available in your area.,4,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0

When I leave distracted and wonder a few blocks away, or further down the road, ""did I close the garage door?""  I can quickly check and close the door.  I also receive notice if the garage door has been open for an extended amount of time (amount can be chosen).  More than once family members have forgotten to close the door when they come in the house.

Once I got started total set up time was about 30 minutes.  Would have been less if I read directions first.  My garage door opener is a 2005 Genie.  Setup and activation was very quick and trouble free.  Able to monitor door position and open/close remotely.  Very satisfied.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
Very easy to install and it was much quicker than I expected. The only complaint is the Alexa integration. It is possible but you have to download a third party app then add a routine in that app then add that apps skill in Alexa. It was somewhat confusing,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0

Have to pay a fee to integrate with IFTTT which sucks but i did get it for less than $30 on prime day so not terribly upset. Haven't had an issue yet and the schedule works good but the alerts are the best. I setup a custom alert to notify if door has been open longer than X amount of time. Makes it nice to be able to just remotely close it if needed.,4,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
I bought this because I have 2 garage doors. The first one works great. Trying to get the hub to recognize this 2nd door separately is IMPOSSIBLE. The best I have been able to do is set the app to open both doors at the same time. VERY DISAPPOINTED,1,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
It is very easy to install and functions just as described for me and my deliveries. It only takes a few minutes to install. I think the only con is the loud beeping but I'm sure it's just a safety feature. Either way it's great. I dont understand the negative. Some just can't be pleased.,5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
Was very simple to install and connect. It’ll you can program it to shut at a certain time in case you forget to close it.

"If you plan on integrating this with your Google Home Assistant and saying ""Hey Google, Open (or close) my garage door"".. NOT GONNA HAPPEN!The integration sucks and to top it off they charge you a subscription fee to link with Google.. My bet is Amazon wants the device for its Alexa eco system..

My second opener is 20 feet from the first (a fairly standard 3-car garage with 1 double door and 1 single door). I had called Chamberlain's support number and John assured me that if the hub was inside the garage, it would work at 20 feet. I figured I would split the difference and place it between each opener at 10 feet to either one. Sadly this is too far. Neither would work at 10 feet so I sent the unit back and bought a Genie Aladdin Connect that hard-wires to either the openers or the wall buttons. Problem solved.",1,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0

Pretty sweet little option for the garage door that didn’t come with reminder to shut your garage. Only thing I would like to see is maybe a timed option that after so many minutes it will shut automatically rather than a predetermined hour mark. Overall good product.,5,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"The very first thing in the product description should be in all caps: NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ALEXA. I assumed (my bad) that because it said it was Amazon SmartKey (or whatever it's called), that meant Alexa compatible too.  I saw that this was asked in the questions and the manufacturer said they were working on a third-party app that would work with Alexa.  That was in 2017!! Where's the app, guys??",3,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
I already own a Chamberlain garage door opener. This hub (and an Add-on sensor) allows me to control and monitor my existing Chamberlain garage door opener and my 2 older Genie garage door openers. It is nice to be able to check the status of all 3 doors with MyQ and share access with family members.,5,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
After install if the door closes but your app says it’s open don’t use the app make sure that you use your garage door opener because the garage door will open and stay open and you’ll get an air in the appThis also happened to me when a driver could not close the door so what I did was install a button to close the garage door close to the exit of the overhead so the driver can just push the button to close it hopefully the next firmware update will fix the strange issues happening,5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0

As mentioned this device does what it's advertised to do.  I was really surprised at how easy the setup and installation was.  I often experience that these types of WiFi devices don't always setup as easy as they should and you have to fiddle with them to get them working correctly.  I had this installed in probably less than 20 minutes.,5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"Setup for this product was very easy. We set it up over the weekend on our single-car garage door and didn't run into any issues. It took maybe 30-45 minutes to install. I have a problem where I get to work in the morning and wonder ""did I shut the garage door?"" even if I checked it 3 times before I left. No more worrying! More than anything, this gives me peace of mind. It's also great in case my husband and I ever forget our keys or garage door opener (which we share and sometimes forget to give to the other person when they need it). Problem solved. Sanity saved. Also a very reasonable price for a cool home gadget.",5,1,2017-12-11,1,1,0

With the garage door sensor, a $8 battery will have to be replaced about every 10 to 12 months.

Had to navigate thru the app a couple of times to get it connected -- it wasn't totally clear.

This thing was super easy to install and setup.  I know people reported problems but it seriously was a breeze for me - took me only about 30 mins to install and have up and running.  The integration with Key is awesome.  Integration with Alexa would give it 5 stars.,4,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"To star, this product is a PITA to setup. The setup process is buggy and I had to factory default the device numerous times and then do a hard button combination to fix the device to allow it to pair.  Initially I thought the server issues were a result of weaker WIFI connectivity, so I upgraded my house to an enterprise level mesh network with wired backhaul. I have great WIFI coverage inside and out now... Yet the MYQ hub still doesnt have great signal strength... Even just feet from an AP.  Customer service wasn't helpful and after hours of attempting to get it, I took to the chamberlain forum and found many people had to return their device for a new one and it worked. I kept searching and found the fix.I feel that someone with advanced electronics, networking and automation experience should not struggle with this device setup. The lack of Alexa support that is once had is disheartening. I think I may give this one to my parents and try the NEXX Garage door opener as in my struggles, I discovered that one has bettter support and integration options.",2,1,2018-3-3,1,0,0
Works great for remotely opening the garage door or for checking to make sure the door is down after I've gone to bed.

I’ve gone through the set up multiple times, each time the opener is clearly connected to the garage door as it opens and closes it several times while syncing, and each time it fails to complete the setup and tells me to call customer service.

Extremely simple to set up and use.  I wish the app had the ability to set up a geo fence to automatically open the garage when you are within a certain distance.  The ability to monitor the status of the garage door when at work is worth the $35 price tag.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

I like the idea of this product. I just installed it. Very easy and simple. Does not work for anything. Got to the point where I pair my door sensor to the smart hub and nothing. No LED light up on door hub. Replaced the battery with some form the 3 pack I bought and nothing. I had high hopes for this product and the quality testing they must do is non existent. Will be talking to Amazon about getting this replaced or refunded. Would like this to work but if they can't quality check there stuff before it leaves that's just sad and forces me to go with another company.,1,1,2018-12-22,1,1,0
I will never buy another MyQ product in my life and I will tell anyone who will listen to never buy it either. I buy a garage door opener that is MyQ ready and then I have to buy a hub to connect it to my phone and now you want me to pay a subscription to link it to my google assistant?!?!  You have lost your mind. I dont care how well your crap works I am not paying a subscription for a feature that every other company with similar technology offers for free. Thats why I pay for the equipment. Total waste of money. I can't wait to replace this piece of garbage.,1,1,2019-2-21,1,1,0
"This product works Great. - The reason for the 4 stars is that they charge a subscription fee to integrate with Alexa, Google, IFTTT and others. That is Stupid!Otherwise, installation was a breeze! Installed and configured in 10 minutes. The most time consuming part is the actual mounting of the Hub. Set up and configuration was simple and fast. Installed 2 door sensors with out a problem.",4,1,2018-9-26,1,1,0
"It is compatible for my nearly 20 year old Chamberlain garage door opener. Easy to install, easy to use. Now I can open and close my garage door while I am out one travel, shopping, in the office or even in my bedroom. Excellent product. Highly recommended!",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"Incredibly easy to setup, easy to use. The only thing wrong with it is the app only allows one login. I mitigated that by downloading wink to the rest of the family's phones so they could use the app without knowing my login info, saving the login info locally to those phones. Bought this to work with a Chamberlain Whisper Drive Plus.Edited: 3/4/19 - App has be redone to allow multiple logins. This product is first rate now, as far as I'm concerned. Increasing to 5 stars.",5,1,2018-12-20,1,0,1

The product was very simple to setup with the MyQ App step by step setup. However there are no instructions for adding to HomeKit and support can just send an email to you with Apple steps on how to add an accessory. There is no HomeKit code on the device or the box and the App does not allow the push of an added device to HomeKit which is required without a code on the device or box of the device. Very disappointed. I actually support the HomeKit App for Apple and this device is not compatible.So this does not work for why I purchased it or I would give it 5 stars,2,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
The product works as described. It opens and shuts the garage door (Overhead Garage Door brand) and alerts me when the door has been left open. My only objection is it beeps really loudly if I use it to shut the garage door and I often leave the house at 5:00 am,4,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"My husband created the account and added me as a guest. It seems to work fine for him, but about half the time when I come back from walking my dog and use myQ phone app to open the door, I get an error that it can't connect to the network, and the door won't open. It's really disappointing.",3,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"In my quest to fully smart kink my house, this was my latest must have. Again, my hapless hubby was informed that we (he) had a new home project to complete. His enthusiasm was palpable.

Highly recommend and the installation was a breeze. Past that this was the first non-Nest smart product I have integrated into my home.

"Excellent product,  replaced my nexx garage opener with this. I recently moved and now have 2 garage doors so I purchased 2 thinking I needed 1 for each but quickly figured out that I only needed one hub and 2 sensors. I read other reviews stating that the company charges for integration with Google home and IFTTT however I was able to get both services up and running quickly and free of charge. The installation was almost to easy, App on my android seems to work great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to control, monitor, or get realtime alerts about their garage door activity.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
Product was dangerous. Door opened and closed randomly. Door would open all hours of the day without using any controls. Finally uninstalled after door closed while in car about to reverse out of garage. Multiple attempts to get help or refund were ignored and had to settle for reduced refund via Amazon but better than having the safety and security risk of not having control of the door function,1,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
Documentation is all in myQ app. No way to study before installation. Their support was excellent when I finally called. Wanted to rename my door names but I did factory reset and started over.

"One less thing to worry about!  If we ever leave the house and have even the least thought about whether or not we closed the garage door behind us, a quick check on the cell phone app clears up any question.

No issues at all and highly recommended.",5,1,2019-5-25,1,0,0
"The app doesn’t open the garage door every time. I have to manually open the door and then the app will close the door. If I try to open it again within a few minutes, it works. If I wait a day, the app will not open the door.My WiFi signal is extremely strong in my garage. Not reliable. Very disappointed.",1,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
Relatively easy to install. I wish you could change the settings for the sound of the beeping and how long it beeps for before it opens or closes. It takes longer than I feel it should and the beeping is incredibly loud but it does the job which is the most important thing.,4,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
Best investment for your automated garage door. Always knowing when your garage is opened and closed is great with the notifications. It allows you to have remote access in case you have friends or family stopping by and they need to be let in.The Amazon delivery feature is also an outstanding feature. No more packages thrown on the porch or left in the rain. Amazon delivery services get a one time access code which opens the garage. It is timed as well so they can drop off inside the garage and leave.,5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"There’s about a 10 second delay before the garage door opening or closing. Not Alexa or smart things compatible, my fault for not reading that part. But the main reason they deserve one star is subscription fee? For a garage door opener??",1,1,2019-8-5,1,2,0

Despite the number of 1-star reviews I went for it since I already have a Chamberlain door opener purchased 3 years ago and figured it should work well.  So setup was very straightforward with no issues.  And thus far it's been accurate when telling me whether door is up or down.  Fun to control from my phone.  Can't speak for anyone with non-Chamberlain door openers.,5,1,2018-9-20,1,0,0
"This is a great attempt at having a device to help open your garage remotely, however the integration with the app and device are sadly poorly executed. This myQ will only work less than half the times, I’ve been unfortunately locked out of my garage by relying on this device, the app connectivity to the actual hardware continuously fails so with that said make sure you have some sort of backup to either get in your home or open your garage.",2,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

So frustrated by this product. It took a week frustrated trying to get it to link to my garage door opener which is a Chamberlain. Customer service is open terrible hours and had to call a day I was working from home. They got it connected by resolving an issue on the back end. Worked great for a few weeks and stopped working after a power outage. The door sensor worked but could not control the door. I attempted to factory default the device and ran into the same issue as the original install. I have wasted so much time on this device I cut my losses and tossed it in the trash.,1,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"Love how easy it was to install. Love how great the myQ  Smart Garage Door Opener works. Open and close your door no matter where you are.

Also lets you know when and how long ago your door was opened or closed. That alone has made this a wonderful purchase well worth the money. Also, no monthly fees.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
Wish I could return this item. The longer we try to use it the worse it gets. Won’t work as claimed about ever other attempt. It just won’t connect and respond. We will go back to the old clickers I guess.,4,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0
I didn't have any problems installing this at my home.  My Overhead Garage Door (2005) worked perfectly.

Product stopped working after 6 weeks; manufacturer says its the battery (which should last 1+ years); manufacturer also said it shouldn't be used to send alerts that inform the customer that the garage door was left open!!!!!

There is no Alexa integration. Why would it even ask me to rate it?!  Set up was not extremely easy. Had to reset the hub and start over multiple times.

Pairing this was a nightmare of like 30 minutes. Following instructions to the T. Thought maybe it wasn’t compatible went back and looked it up like 5 times.

I bought this product to integrate with my google Home setup.  This does NOT integrate with Google Home.

Despite saying our model was compatible, the hub would not connect to our garage door and instead said we could use it to “Monitor” if the garage was open or closed. Aka we would not be able to use it for its actual purpose of opening/closing the garage door. It is a complete waste of money and was returned an hour after being opened!!",1,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"After reading the reviews, we were a little concerned about the difficulty of installing it.  We downloaded their app, and it made it very easy. It had step-by-step instructions which we followed and it was no problem at all.The only downside so far is the length of the cord for the hub. It is supposed to be mounted on the ceiling, and  plugged into an electrical outlet without an extension cord.  It barely reached one of our outlets. If we had a longer cord, we could’ve neatly attached  it to the ceiling instead of having it stretch across.",4,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"This device works great. Installation was simple but setting up the connection to my Liftmaster garage door opener required contact with their support service. The service person knew just what to tell me to fix the problem. It would have been nice if their phone app would have guided the setup correctly. Once setup properly, the remote works great. Alexa operation is questionable and will take some research if at all possible.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
Doesn’t work with Alexa or Siri without purchasing additional equipment. You have to unlock your phone for the Apple Watch app to work and then it regularly gets stuck at “authenticating”.,1,1,2019-7-31,1,1,0
Awesome garage opener hub if it wasn't for the ANNOYING ALARM! So I figured out how to disable the alarm easily on my YouTube channel AmazonRealReviews. Check out my video if your having the same complaint. Now my hub works perfectly without the alarm.,3,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I would have preferred a manual to read before beginning the installation instead of following along on the app, but the instructions were easy to follow and the videos helped.

This was super easy to install and get working with the app.  I would say the only real negative is how far the receiver needs to be away from the opener itself means that you have to leave the black power cord running across your ceiling,4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
Wow! Received this today and had it installed and up in running with my droid phone  in about 20 mins. I have a Chamberlain 1/2 hp chain drive opener purchased in 2013 (purple) learn button. Will do a follow up review in a few weeks after our 3 family members use it. Able to know if door is open or closed and able open and close the door using the phone app. I also set up an alert to send me an email if the door is open for more than 5 minutes. Eliminates the need/security risk of having a remote in any of our vehicles that may be parked in the driveway.,5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,1
It was easy to install and operate through MyQ app.  However there is no Alexa integration and connecting Google assistant is by paying a subscription fees and that too wont let you unlock the door unlike August lock integration with Google which lets you open and close the door without any fees.,2,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
"The installation is quick, but the instructions tell you to plug it in anywhere in the garage to start. I would modify that to say put it close to the opener when linking the motor to the hub. It will connect much easier. Once connected you can move the hub a little further when mounting.",4,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
Easy to setup. Worked well with my lift master garage door opener. It took about 10 mins to setup start to end. The steps are miss guiding when setting up Alexa. They need to give easier instructions. The system is reliable and highly recommend!,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
It does what it says and the stand alone app is excellent in doing what I want it to do. Alexa integration is through another platform and was so convoluted to set up I decided sticking with the standard app is sufficient.

Love this last night I would have forgotten  to shut my garage door. With the program feature at 8:pm my phone alerted me that my garage door was shutting. So if you set it for what ever times you want to make sure it got closed. It works perfectly.,5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
Very easy and simple to install.  Gives you the peace of mind knowing that the garage door is closed and you can actually check it.  The only feature missing and needs to be added is “geo-fencing” - where if the app detects that I’m in 1000ft or 500 ft of my home to open the garage door.,5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

"I previously installed a wifi extender in my garage and made easy connection. My ring app faces the garage door, so I can see if I  forget to close the door. The settings make it easy to notify you if the garage door is open. But now I can open or close it with my cell phone from anywhere as long as I have data available. No more questioning if you left the garage door open.  Make sure to close the app when you're done, you don't want to accidentally open or close it.",5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"Very easy to install and reasonably priced when on sale. However, Google and Alexa integration don’t allow you to use voice commands to open and close the door.

"I like the idea of opening my garage through an app on my phone opposed to the separate remote that I manage to keep losing, and the in garage deliveries feature. It was a bit difficult to set up and there is a delay. I am not sure I trust it enough yet to enable in garage deliveries or open my garage when I am not home to make sure it actually closes. A few times while testing it out, it would open the garage and then give an error message about not able to connect to the base when I would attempt to close it.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"I wanted to control my garage door remotely. I have a Chamberlain opener and love it. For the past 4 years, my network ison a 5 GHz band. To much traffic and interference on the 2.4 GHz band. Little did I know that the MyQ only works on 2.4 GHz. The product drops connection from my network every couple of weeks. When it drops it takes hours to get it back online. The worst thing, the company will not stand behind this product. If I would have known this, Amazon would have sold one less MyQ",1,1,2019-2-27,1,1,0
The installation was very well designed and it works well but I wish that the notification sound it generates on my iPhone were more audible.  Another brand I have is very noticable.  I think the GUI  of the app needs considerable work to make it more intuitive.,5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"I used this for almost 3 months and my experience was good until it opened the garage one night randomly. I setup alerts to send notification when garage opens but I didn't get any such notification when garage opened in the night. I contacted myQ support but  they didn't have any answer. After few days, my garage opened two more times in the night without any of us opening and no alert was sent. After these 3 incidents, I freaked out and unplugged the device.  I'm giving one star because of these random openings. Ever since I unplugged myQ, no more such incidents.",1,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"Took only about 5 minutes to install and setup.  Works perfectly, but please check first to ensure you have a strong wifi signal in your garage.

"I love my new garage door opener! I don't have to take an opener when I go out for a bike ride anymore. I also love that I can check the status of the door remotely and open and close it when I am away. The only challenge I had was that during setup, the instructions say to press the button on the garage opener at one point when they really mean on the garage sensor box that you attach to the door. Also, I had to change my home WIFI network or password and could not find a way to just change that without resetting everything and setting it up again. Unfortunately, I forgot about the bad instructions and it took me awhile to remember that I need to push button on the sensor box. Once setup though, it works very well! I would give it a 5 if it had better setup instructions and easier transitions for network changes.",4,1,2018-8-9,1,0,0
"Easy straight forward install if you don’t have a fear of ladders.  Just installed and 3/29/18 is go-live date.  Works perfectly with my Chamberlain opener.

"Having the ability to know whether my garage door is open or closed and being able to change that remotely is awesome and this works well and super easy to set up although the instructions are lacking.

Once setup it took 3 minutes to get on a step ladder and screw the hub unit into ceiling drywall. Don't overthink it. The setup is not rocket science. My only ding is the loud beeping it makes when closing. Once installed I can check the open\close status from the app and open\close accordingly. Thumbs up!",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
Great device. My door opener isn't on the list but worked great. No issues what so ever. Instructions in the app were spot on. Took me about 40 mins to install as I was taking my time. Now I have a way for Amazon to deliver packages without me worrying about them being stolen from my front porch. So glad I go it. Also a bit of security as I know when the door opens and closes. Also will alert if door stayed open so I can close it remotely.,5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,1

Very nice not hard to setup but use the instructions on your phone. I was looking for written instructions but there wasn’t any. Only the box content. Only wish they would give you an option for another door hub at a cheaper rate but that is the only negative.,5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
Like: It took less than 30 minutes to install & it functioned properly the 1st around.Dislike: it’s a bit slow especially if your signal is weak in the garage area. It also disables the exterior keypad.,3,1,2018-9-20,1,2,0

Extremely easy installation.  Lets me know when the garage door opens when I'm not home which is ok as it is usually my wife returning from her work.  Also like the integration with Amazon key.

Perfect for what I wanted and very easy to install.  Luckily for me my home WiFi strength is very good in my garage - that could be an issue for some.

"No real complaints here, this is incredibly easy to setup and use. It paired with my existing garage door opener in a similar manner to setting up a new remote, you press a button on the garage opener itself and then one on the MyQ remote -- you're done.

Installed this on my existing 2011 model garage door opener. If you can follow directions and twist a screwdriver you can install  this in 10 min or less. I used a 3rd party app to facilitate Alexa compatibility and voice commands (Simple Commands) Tutorials are available on you tube to set this up. I Set it up to automatically close at 8PM in case I forget to close it at night (which I sometimes do) Works like a charm and  I do highly recommend this product.,5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
I bought this for my second garage door as it was cheaper at the time to buy the whole setup than just buying the hub add on.  Paired easily and worked as described for the second door and now have a spare main unit if needed.,5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

This is a great product! I had no problem installing it and it synced up with minimal time. I’ve had no issues with it and it has never lost connection to the wifi. The alerts are very prompt and they come through as soon as the door reaches the top. It’s a great way to keep your house safer and make sure you didn’t leave the garage door open. Would have no problem recommending it to my family or friends!!,5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
I'm super pissed at this thing. Apparently if there is any error with the safety sensor it will OPEN your garage door but will not CLOSE your garage door... so now I am at work and can see that it happily opened the door but refuses to close it. Only solution is to close it from the actual button on the opener itself. Completely F-ing useless if I am 40 miles away at work... at first I liked it but now that it is leaving my garage door open for the next 8 hours I'm definitely going to remove this piece of crap.,1,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"I was scared it was going to be hard to install according to other reviews but maybe they are outdated.

so i will definitely recommend this product. it's easy to install and their customer service is also responsive. plus it works. so you can monitor your garage door easily anytime. the reason for 4 start is they definitely need to improve their app. there are minor bugs which they improve it will be perfect. also if they can add future fixed time to open garage that will be best,4,1,2019-5-25,1,0,0
The product gives you the ability to open and close your door remotely with your phone and you can tell when your door is open.  The hub uses wifi.  It has the ability to work with Alexa but that requires a subscription from Chamberlain.,4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0

Chamberlain is IFFTT enabled also which is a plus.",5,1,2018-6-6,1,0,0
"Install was easy, pairing was a challenge and the app does very little to assist. The most frustrating thing is that the status of the door will not update if someone uses the regular opener buttons.

"Installation instructions are a bit confusing but the fact I installed it means you probably can to.  The hardest thing I had was connecting it to my home network.  Downloading the app was simple.  Attaching the parts in the garage was simple.  (The instructions and videos were spot on). It works fine!  I wish there was an easier way other than having to open the chamberlain app and then choosing the garage to get the door to open.  It's not compatible with Alexa so when you're home you can't just tell Alexa to open the door.  But overall, I still give it 4 stars.  I love being able to let someone into my garage while I'm at work.",4,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0

I'm not happy with this purchase.,2,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
This device is not handy or useful at all. It tells me my garage door has been open for two days when in actuality it has not been. Sometimes when I am away from home it says it is open so I go to shut it and actually have opened it. Then it says I have to deal with it in person. Definitely not worth spending your money on.

I paid full price for this product brand new but when I opened the sealed box it was obvious that it was used. There was no tab to pull out of the door sensor and the velcro stickers were already stuck on it and stuck to the box. Why did I receive a used product when I paid for a BRAND NEW ONE??? The product ended up working fine and so far the sensor hasn't fallen off of the garage door but EVERYDAY I look to make sure it hasn't fallen and gotten crushed by the car backing out of the garage.,4,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0

I’d like to because it gave me a piece of mine wondering if my garage door is open or close when I am away from home.

I have a Wink hub and had no problem adding the Chamberlain as a device.",5,1,2019-3-23,1,0,0

"I recently purchased the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener and it does not work.  I have had nothing but issues with the entire system.  Set up was a breeze, but after that it does not work...constant error messages.  APP shows door closed with its open and open when closed.  If you use the wall opener that comes with the garage door opener then the MyQ does not recognize that the door opener was used and error shows up on APP...complete waste of money.",1,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0

"Picked it up on prime day after reading all the reviews.  I had some doubts initially but after installing it using the instructions worked for the first time on two Genie garage door openers that are over 10 years old.  But then it would not work properly even after reset of the hub.  I called the customer service and spoke to a lady who patiently walked me through the installation and it has worked well since then.  This thing is amazing and I am glad i picked up one.  Tip: make sure to install the sensors on the top panel on the right or the left, do not put in the middle since it does not work well.  Also you need good wifi in the garage.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0

"In the end, a disappointing product. The mobile app often freezes or logs out leaving you sitting in the driveway futzing with your phone instead of the seamless experience it portrays to be.

Super easy to install and use. The most difficult part was finding the adhesive strips/screws in the box (they didn’t slide out when I opened the box and stayed in the box) I eventually found them digging through everything. Minor issue and I should have looked more throughly in everything. Video made it super easy to install.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

This worked great for the 1 week it worked! I've reset the thing several times and it works for about a day and then stops responding to opening and closing my garage within the app. It's actually been more of a problem because it always unlinks my actual garage remotes during the reset process.

Not only I can open and close the door with our phones, it lets me know when someone opens it even if it's with the existing hardwired switch. I also setup an action to automatically close it in the morning and in the evening. No more ""turn back, I don't remember if the garage door closes"", or getting out of the bed to check before sleeping.Very happy with the product and the app. Well worth it.",5,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0

"UPDATE - Trying to get this to work through either Alexa or IFTTT but no luck. It seems that Chamberlain has decided to make a money grab and charge extra for a “premium” account but even that doesn’t work. Also, from reading their support discussion boards, Chamberlain is well aware of the issue but won’t fix it. GO SPEND YOUR MONEY WITH SOMEONE ELSE!  Unless Chamberlain decides to stop with the money grab this will be the last product of theirs I buy.Got this a few days ago.  Really easy installation and setup.  Only took me 15 minutes and worked perfectly right away.  Our existing garage door openers haven't been working great for a while now so I decided to add this to our setup.

I had to power cycle the hub a few times to get it to pair with the sensor and then it wouldn't pair with the door opener, which is a newer Chamberlain model. More power cycling and re-pairing with the sensor and it finally paired with the door opener. Physical installation was a piece of cake, but pairing issues were very frustrating and added two unnecessary hours to installation time.

Easy to set up but then find out there is no Alexa skill for this opener. You have to go through all kids of skills and set up a skill and blah blah. If I would have known it didn’t work with Alexa I would not have bought.,1,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
Works. Be aware that when using the app to close the door the hub beeps loudly in the garage. There is no way to shut it off.  Again it’s only when you use the app to close it. That is my only complaint. Works as expected.,4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

This works fine to control garage door and allow for Amazon deliveries into garage.

I had bought a MyQ to control 2 of our 3 garage doors. I was impressed with the integration and app. I bought the second one so I can use the sensor to pair with the current hub. Then I found that you can only control 2 sensors with 1 hub. I dont see why that is a restriction with the hardware. Seems they want to sell more hubs and have made this restriction. I like MyQ but I wish they could allow more sensors on the same hub.,4,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

"The associated MyQ app gats stuck with a “Close error” and shows incorrect garage door status. It’s slow for the hub to report the door status and 30% of the time it doesn’t know the door is closed and ends up giving the error which can only be resolved by opening and closing the garage door from the local wall button or remote. I mainly got this unit for the Amazon Garage Key feature, but at this point, I cannot trust that MyQ is giving me a correct door status. So far not impressed with the product, but will give it a few more days to see if it gets better, otherwise it’s back to Amazon for the return",2,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0

I have one sensor that works and one sensor that just continues to have a problem.  Email to Myq support have not been answered.Product quality appears extremely poor. The hub and the sensors are made of extremely low weight plastic and it has no feel of quality.  I would’ve thought a leader like Chamberlain would’ve done it differently.

When I entered its serial number (no, not the MAC address, the serial number) in the MyQ app and tried to ""Submit"", it said the hub was offline (still plugged in with its blinking blue LED a foot from the phone) and I should check network connections. Seriously? There is no network connection yet, although I have 4 WiFi bars on my phone next to the opener. I sort of thought the app would handle the WiFi connection. But it refuses. There sure isn't any way to do it on the hub itself. Dumb manual? Dumb app? Dumb hub? Who knows? Who cares? Junk.UPDATE: Spent a half-hour looking around the Chamberlain web and found a couple of sets of much longer, more complicated instructions - the quick-start guide wasn't even close, a complete waste of paper.

It failed multiple times with either the same error message (#309 IIRC) as before or a really helpful one telling it didn't connect to the network. Duh. I thought I'd follow the app's help for this, but that eventually led to either (1) an attempt to connect to the Chamberlian site over the Internet, impossible because my phone was connected to the MYQ-xxx hub's network or (2) an attempt to connect to a web page presumably generated by the hub that failed with a 404 error.",1,1,2018-5-6,1,3,0

"I had a Chamberlain myQ garage opener which I absolutely loved in my old place. Unfortunately, the myQ hub doesn’t perform to the same degree at all when I am trying to upgrade an old Liftmaster garage opener (purple learn button). The entire installation process is easy and simple enough but I had to run the code learning process multiple times before the hub is fully set up. Unfortunately, the reason for the multiple attempts is probably the same reason why the hub couldn’t open/close consistently. The signal it sends to the opener was never consistent. The hub is connected and the door sensor is live but the signal simply won’t pass through. The hub would even bleep and blink, meaning it got the command to close, but the signal still won’t acivate the opener. I tried calling for Chamberlain for support but they couldn’t provide a definitive solution.Rather than waiting for a replacement, I just returned it and got a Linear Zwave garage opener instead.

"Very easy to install. Bought this to take the worry out of “did I shut the garage door on my way to work this morning?” The only thing I didn’t like was how loud the beeping was if you shut the door using the app. The hub makes a loud beeping as a safety measure, but man is it loud.",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
Painfully often get stuck waiting for it to open or no response. If your phone gets off WiFi and onto cellular while the app is open then it won’t work. I WISH there was a widget for it too instead of having to open the app,4,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
I love this! Setup was easy and I had it running in 10-15 minutes.  It's very nice to be able to open my garage door with my smart phone when taking a dog walk or if a friend of mine picks me up or an Uber night out. I highly recommend it and I'd buy it again without thinking if it somehow broke.,5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0

Spent lots of time on support line trying to get it to work. It needed to have updated loaded and we had just bought it.

We will just buy a new integrated garage door system next.,1,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"Very easy install (via iOS app) and the product and app do exactly what they say they do.

Read the pros and cons on Amazon review for this product.  Decided to buy it because it was cheap $28 and I needed a way to remotely open the garage door for my second home in Lake Tahoe.  Very easy to install...the app helped walk you through the process.  It came complete with video instructions on how to install the hub and sensor.

Really good product. Works as advertised if you have one of the compatible garage door openers. I found the setup instructions and tutorial process to be one of the best I have seen. Very simple and straight forward with video guidance and instructions. Really easy to get up and running. Only drawback is Amazon Alexa integration which is not out of the box.

"I will repost after the software upgrade occurs (if I remember).  The software side of the installation did not go smoothly.  My Linksys EA9500 router did not like adding an unencrypted device to the network.  After muddling through a number of Linksys menus on my PC, I was able to make the WiFi connection through the router to my iPhone 6+.  At this point, I had all the components on my workshop bench and the garage door going up and down.  Then I installed the door sensor on the top of the garage door and the hub on the ceiling using the same power receptacle as the Chamberlain garage door opener installed some years earlier (purple programming button).  The garage door would open, but would only sound the alarm and blink the light when asked to close.  I called Chamberlain technical support.  While stuck on hold, I tested the unit again.  Voila!  It worked.  I still had questions for the support agent.  To my disappointment, this is only a single user system, so if you install the app on another iPhone or iPad, you must log out of one device in order to log into another one.  There went hooking up my wife's phone, too. :(  However, the support representative assured me an upcoming new app release would enable multiuser functionality.  No projected date for the release, however.  My major complaint is that sometimes the unit works, sometimes it doesn't.  For several minutes at a time, the app can tell you that your door is up when it is actually down.  Doing a couple of manual opens and closes seems to reset the hub status a little more quickly, but what if no one is home?  Hopefully, the new release will address the reliability and consistency issues as well.  The mounting bracket that goes on the ceiling is a bit of a challenge to install.  The screw holes are masked from your view by clamps which have holes in them so you can insert the Phillips screwdriver and drive the screws into the garage ceiling drywall or a stud.  They should have provided some rubber washers to grip the screws so that you don't risk dropping the screws on the garage floor and having to go down the ladder to retrieve them.  The door sensor is held to the garage door by double-sided sticky fastening strips.  My experience is after a few hot summers and cold winters, you will be down at the Ace Hardware store to purchase fasteners with fresh adhesive.  The alerts that you can set up (also an opening/closing schedule) are unreliable as well.  So if you really want to know the status of your garage door when you are two miles down the road after leaving the house, you need to pull over and access the app (you can set up touch ID) and then bring up the app to see if the door is down.  Hopefully, it will be.. Better check again after another 10 minutes or so...  Chamberlain needs to improve both the hardware and software installation experience for the user.  They also need to work on the reliability of opening/closing as well as obtaining the garage door status.  That said, this system shows promise if they at least improve the reliability issues.  If the new software release addresses the reliability issues, I will bump the rating to 4 stars.  To get 5 stars, they need to fix the hub and door sensor mounting issues.",3,1,2018-1-27,1,3,0

"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!  This product does NOT work with Alexa - even though when you search for garage door openers that work with Alexa, this device pulls up as one of the first choices. Bad move by both Amazon & MyQ; very misleading. Further, you don’t realize this until after it’s installed, therefore, returning it requires uninstalling it. RIDICULOUS!!!!",1,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
i think it is probably a good product.  was easy to set up and connect to WIFI.  problem was the liftmaster 8500 comes 2 ways apparently.  The issue is the opener comes with MyQ controller.  not much good with out WIFI motor.  i still gave it 4 stars for setup and install.,4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
"If your garage door opener has a myq on the side of it all you need to do is program it to the hub. DO NOT TRY AND INSTALL DOOR SENSORS.

Installed it according to plans. Would not open or close. Turns out it wouldn't pick up wifi in the garage. I run computers through the wifi in the garage but hub would not pick up signal. I kept moving it closer until it was right next to the router and it still would not pick it up.I would return it but kids threw away the box. Not worth the money.,1,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0

This system works great to you want to pull out your phone to open your garage door or if you want to allow amazon to deliver to your gatage.. aside from that look elsewhere. The door sensor is extremely unreliable as sensing up or down and the system cannot be controlled by alexa which is why I bought it.

It will tell you its closed for say 2hrs but I would like to know as its closing if its closed at that time.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
This product is great when it works right. But since buying it less than a year ago the one sensor has failed. The second one seems to be failing now.

"If you're trying to make your garage door opener compatible with HomeKit, stay away from this!  I purchased this Hub from Amazon and had to get the HomeKit Home Bridge directly from Chamberlain.  I spent over two hours trying to get the two units to work together.  The instructions are very limited, but I followed them exactly as written (and tried multiple times).  That didn't work, so I went online and realized many more people have had issues with these products working together.  There were various suggestions that didn't work for me.  Judging by the comments on those sites, the suggestions didn't really work for anybody.When I thought there was no hope, I stumbled upon a YouTube video from Lance Scott.  He noted that the Liftmaster 888LM Wall Controller can serve as the hub and works with the Home Bridge.

"Chamberlain has had to keep cutting the price of this item because no one will buy it, and for good reason.

Only reason I didn’t give it five stars was I had a firmware issue that I had to wait for about twenty minutes for devise to resolve. It could not find and communicate with my opener (craftsman) until it updates. Which it did by itself after being connected to my network for about twenty minutes.

This is a great product  and allows you full control of your garage doors from anywhere.  Installation was very simple and the iPhone app is excellent.

"I'm an iOS/iPhone user and am an experienced tech hobbiest with a home outfitted with ""smart home"" products from Rachio, eero, ecobee,  Lutron, Ring, Amazon, Apple, Logitech and more. The setup of this product is needlessly complex and difficult and downright doesn't work properly when integrated (and so silly to have a separate box) with another of their products the ""Home Bridge"" to use Apple HomeKit and Siri. Let me explain...1. To install JUST this product you must have a 2.4 ghz Wifi signal in your home, this device will not work on the 5.0 ghz band. While unusual in 2018 that's not a deal breaker. What is a terrible pain is you must ensure your smartphone, used to setup this device, is also logged into the 2.4 ghz band. This can be tricky because many modern routers blend the bands (both 2.4 & 5.0) and every wi-fi device in your home chooses the best for that device. Of course the MyQ Smart Garage chooses the 2.4 ghz band but nearly all modern smartphones choose the 5.0 ghz (because it allows faster speeds in general) at which time you can not setup the MyQ Smart Hub. The Chamberlain app doesn't even warn you of this but rather fails or hangs with no explanation if your phone is on 5.0 ghz. Other products from other companies in the smartphone space somehow have developed a way to properly setup their devices even if on separate bands but not Chamberlain. This led to me having to setup this device in places in the house where the 5.0 ghz signal was weak so that my phone would join 2.4 ghz. Crazy! The process to setup this device while not ""hard"" is needlessly complex and takes many steps from joining an adhoc temporary wifi network setup by the Smart Hub, to launching a local webpage created by the Smart Hub, interpreting a series of flashing and steady lights on the device itself, to switching back to regular (2.4!) home wifi, switching to ""complete"" the install in the smartphone app etc. It's just a pain. That said it does work in the end and once setup the app itself, while not pretty and modern looking does work and opens and closes the door reliably and will send you customizable alerts if the door is open too long etc.",2,1,2018-7-19,1,2,0
"I can’t tell how much impressed I am with this product. Made my life easy on Garage door management.

I have a very old garage door opener that can't be controlled digitally. I was aware of this when I ordered the MyQ.What I purchased it for is to be able to be notified when my garage door opens or closes and this it does perfectly.,5,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0
This product works very well. It was easy to install the instructions guid you once you down load the app. I feel its more secure then having a garage door open that can easily be stolen from your car. The garage door opener also runs out of batteries. I would highly recommend this product.,5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"Ok so preface - it works, and it was easy to set up. If that's all you care about, this product is fine.The real issue comes with its reliability and its app. The app randomly forces you to log in again (this is likely due to my phone's clearing of temporary data, but it's something I wish they'd handle better). Sometimes the app is unresponsive and if their servers go down (they did one day) you can't open your door. All of these things point to the core issue which is that although it would be convenient for this to work over 4G from anywhere in the world, there needs to be a local access mode that works over your wifi. Most of the time you use this, you'll be in your driveway. There's no reason it shouldn't just send a command over your local network using a secure token.",2,1,2018-7-7,1,2,0
Easy to install and up in a few minutes. The only improvement could be to add it to Alexa so that it can be opened using voice command. The integration with the Xfinity App is cool but couldn't integrate with the alarm system. Something I would be looking forward to.,5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
My only issue right now is that it doesn’t integrate as smoothly as I expected with alarm.com and an existing z-wave system. So can’t remote control everything from one app. Haven’t tried Alexa with it.,5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0

This has been a fantastic device. It was very easy to set up - just a couple of screws. The part that goes on the garage door is battery operated and doesn't need any physical connections; the larger box simply plugs in to the wall.

"I actually rarely review things on Amazon, but this ""opener"" gave us so much hassle that I had to warn others about it.  If you are okay with this device functioning approximately 35% of the time as described then this is for you.  We purchased this after we left the garage door up accidentally and wanted something to warn us that we did not close it.  We got daily alerts that our garage door was up, when in fact it was closed.  However, one time it was accurate.  We got to where we ignored the alerts.  Furthermore, the app function on our smart phones worked less than half the time to close or open the door remotely.  So not only do you have a device that is a LIAR about whether or not the garage door is up, but even if it tells you the truth the app won't close the door from a remote location.  This was crap in every sense of the word.  Thanks to Amazon for easy returns.  We are trying a different brand with a camera and will hopefully have more success.",1,1,2017-11-28,1,2,0

The schedule option was not working well. I had it scheduled to close every night at 10pm. The door was already closed and the unit decided to open the door. Woke up to the door open twice. I deleted the schedule and reinstalled the app but still have the same issue. Now I just use it so I can check if the door is open or closed.,2,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"First set up, it only allowed door to be monitored only. I didn't think it would work. I decided to reinstalled it again and surprisingly, it worked. Glad it works or I would have to return.",4,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
The product doesn’t work with my garage door opener except to see if it’s open or closed but I can’t control it to open it or close it so what’s the point. ?,1,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
Easy to install!  No more going to work and turning around to make sure the garage is closed.  It also works to let the housekeeper in when I forget to unlock the door.  I have enjoyed this product.,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"This product did exactly what we hoped for. With the app downloaded at the start of the install process, it was a quick leap from the quick start guide to the app’s step by step instructions. The hub found the sensor, opener and WiFi router on the first try.The app interface takes a little learning. After one week of use, it is great.",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0

"Easy install. However, there are random times it doesn’t know the door is closed. I think it maybe when it’s too cold outside. But requires a manual reset (open and close garage door) to get the right reading",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

I don't really care much for the buzzer and flashing light prior to the door closing. Seems like overkill especially since the door is set to go back up if there is an interference.I initially mounted the hub next to my garage light (I have LiftMasters installed). I was surprised to see that the light in the Hub doesn't do dual duty and serve as a light for the garage. I couldn't get the hub to link up with my #1 door opener until I installed it next to the LiftMaster.,3,1,2018-5-16,1,2,0
