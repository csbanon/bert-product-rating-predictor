"The genuine Samsung Evo Select line of Micro SD cards are great. They are reliable and they live up to the speed and capacity classifications they claim to. I've been using Samsung cards for years and they are the only brand that consistently doesn't give me any issues year after year.This 32GB card is no exception. However, by default the card is formatted as FAT32, but I prefer exFAT as FAT32 won't allow you to transfer a folder containing more than 4GB to the card. That's annoying if you are moving data from an old card to a new one. FAT32 has 4GB file size limitations, but on a transfer it recognizes a directory containing lots of files as 1 thing, and applies the 4GB limit. This will give you an error (in Windows anyway) that there isn't enough space available for the transfer. But if you copy the files individually it works fine. Or just format the card to exFAT and it will accept the folder that exceeds 4GB easily. exFAT will work just fine in an Android phone as well (Android 5.1 or higher. Earlier versions may have some issues with the exFAT formatting)",5,1,2017-7-26,1,3,1
"Another user review points out that their 128GB Samsung EVO Select card is only rated for 60MB/s write speeds.If you look under the ""From the manufacturer"" part of the product description with the 64GB version of the card selected you will see that it states that it is rated for write speeds up to 20MB/s.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,2,1
"You should be very careful when buying SD cards online. One way I knew this listing was legitimate was by checking the merchant during order review, mine showed as ""Amazon.com Services LLC"".Upon arrival I checked the packaging which had no misprints, and the micro SD card graphics were crisp and had white sides, the model number on the packaging also matched the model written on the card's backside, all pointing to a legitimate item.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,1,1

"All the Samsung EVO cards are UHS-3 except for the one EVO 32Gb version, where a quick sleight of hand is made to UHS-1.  But that should be easy to spot, right...?  No, because the cards as listed confuse two different ratings - designated on the card by a Roman Numeral (usually a 'I') and a number placed inside a 'U'.  The number in the U is the cards' UHS rating, the former it's type - if you have a jeweler's loupe, you can see what they are on the card.The listings have all the cards as UHS-I, which, if you don't know prior to purchasing, they've mixed things up.  The cards are all Type I and UHS-3...except for the 32Gb, which is UHS-1.",1,1,2018-1-4,1,2,1
"First time I bought this, it got corrupted within a year. I am a normal user of the phone and do not fool around with the sd card. I just let it sit in my phone, and never take it out. Left with no choice (since my internal is only 32GB- Samsung S7 Edge) I reordered this. It has got corrupted again, this time after working for only 8 months (Bought November 2017, corrupted June 2018). What am I supposed to do? How do I get in touch with Samsung support?",1,1,2018-7-8,1,7,0
"It seems like everything I purchase “new” on amazon.com is sent to me broken, used, or defective in some way or another. I was sent this microSD card and couldn’t even use it, when I inserted it into my computer it said “this drive has problems and must be repaired click here to scan this drive for errors.”. I tried formatting it on my android phone and still it was unusable and repeatedly gave me errors about the card being corrupt and saying it requires formatting, then had errors during formatting. Every device I try to use with this card has a problem with it.",1,1,2017-12-4,1,1,0
This product was delivered in an open package that had clearly been damaged before shipment because other cards in the same mailer were undamaged . It was not sold as used or repackaged. It apeares as if the SD card was removed from the packaging and replaced. Update : SD card was clearly damaged and it clearly explains why it was repackaged.,1,1,2020-6-12,1,2,1
"I only buy Samsung SD cards.  I verify them all with Samsung's software called ""Samsung Memory Card/UFD Authentication Utility.""  This is a review for the 128GB EVO Select.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,1,1
"I tell you what, I remember a time when a 128GB micro SD card used to cost 100 smackaroos! These EVO cards are Samsung's economical line, and can be bought for only 20 smackaroo's. With average read times around 90MBPS, and write times around 50MBPS, these are most certainly great for 1080P HD. And because of their high performance, they are obviously great for taking pictures as well.However, these cards are not really rated for 4K. If you need a card for 4K, you need one that has closer to 150MBPS read and 90-100MPBS write. This is because 4K is very demanding on hardware. And now that people are starting to talk about 8K, the hardware demands go up even higher still.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"I use this in my Raspberry Pi 2B.I was overclocking, and had unplugged the RPi after a lock-up, which caused damage to the card.",5,1,2017-12-30,1,3,0
"Bought two of these 32gig 'Select' cards for a dashcam and a GoPro. 1080p video playback of moving objects is slightly jerky. Tested each card with H2testw. Maximum read speed was 15.6 mb/s, maximum write speed was 15.2 mb/s. That's an unusual result. Expected at least two mb/s difference in r/w performance. No errors reported, storage capacity was right on. Product description states ""up tp 95 mb/s read speed"" Guaranteed minimum speed of 30mb/s puts the card into the next speed rating. Very misleading advertisement. Still, these cards are faster than the minimum r/w speeds of 10 mb/s they are  rated for. Good enough for an old cell phone or cheap point and shoot camera.",1,1,2019-1-27,1,4,0
"This was a 32 GB SD card for a tablet.  When it finally arrived, late (AND NOT HANDED TO ME LIKE THE DELIVERY SERVICE STATED AS IT WAS LEFT IN MY DRIVEWAY TO BE RUN OVER), I brought it in.  Tablet kept saying it was corrupted and refused to do anything with it.  Could not get my PC to read it either.  Finally put it in another tablet which allowed me to format it finally.  Put it back in the tablet it was bought for.... says it's a 64 GB that's half full...  whaaaaaaa?I have no idea what the deal is with this thing honestly.  This was supposed to go in the tablet that was a Mother's Day gift.  I did get it to accept pictures finally, but I don't have a lot of faith it won't fail and I have no reason why it says it's half full when it had just been formatted.  Doesn't make a bit of sense.  I'm sure I will be replacing it.  Since it came late, I went ahead and sent the tablet to my mother and I will deal with the failure later.",2,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"I buy a lot of Samsung EVO MicroSD Cards of various sizes (32GB, 64GB, 128GB, etc.) & haven't had any issues yet. I use them in phones, Raspberry PI projects, cameras, Nintendo Switch, chromebooks, etc.On Amazon Prime Day I recently purchased another Samsung EVO 32GB. I always use CrystalDiskMark to check the speeds of cards to help make sure they're real and not fake. The read speed of this new card was 20 MB/s & writing speed was 30 MB/s - which was way off! After repeating the tests a few times, I figured I got my first bad card.",4,1,2019-8-15,1,2,0

Usually I'm  attracted to the dark silenlt flys bad drone! This opened my eyes to better workmanship and just the detail stood out! I almost sent it straight back thinking what if this thing is as good as advertised? How would I get my exercise? My friends would quit calling me dipstip! Boy am I glad I took the chance and kept it! Now I fly like a pro with not a single crash or a forehead to mend.ter your having a child-like Christmas! They only thing that might be downside is that I haven't figured out how to work it with VR. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I also have a 6.9"" screen on my Samsung S20 ultra. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! It appeared at my door in less then two days Otherwise! When I awoke after opening the door and passing out, I new I had fun times ahead! After reading my new husler end to end then I noticed a large box had been deliverd! otherwise I might have turned in for the day contented and quite worn out!

I recently got a Galaxy S20+ and wanted to take advantage of the ability to add a large storage Micro-SD card to upgrade the phone's standard 128GB internal storage.It wasn't that many years ago that 8-GB was A-LOT! Nowadays the phones operating systems take up way more than 8-GB just for that!,5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"It arrived on time. It works fine. But, storage capacity is less than stated. It states 128gb, it actually has 119.2gb. I have learned that all manufacturers are ripping off the consumers. Samsung ripped me off for 8.8gb!Virtually every storage device manufacturer defines 1KB=1000 bytes, 1MB=1,000,000 bytes, and 1GB=1,000,000,000 bytes. The fine print on the packaging indicates this. Let's call these ""marketing"" GB. Technically, however, 1KB=1024 bytes, 1MB=1,048,576 bytes (1024*1024), and 1GB=1,073,741,824 bytes (1024*1024*1024). Computer operating systems will use the more correct technical values when calculating sizes. Thus, when you divide 128,000,000,000 (Samsung's advertised capacity) by 1,073,741,824, you get just over 119GB. The packaging's fine print also indicates ""Actual user storage less"", which explains the difference between the calculated 119GB and actual 118GB. The playing field is level among manufacturers because nearly all of them use the same practice, but it requires the consumer to be aware of it when looking for a device of a particular actual capacity. For example, since file sizes are reported using actual values, users will need to convert between ""marketing"" capacities and actual capacities to ensure they're getting a device large enough to hold the desired files. As always, caveat emptor ""BUYER BEWARE""!",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
Its not just for nintendo switch but i just happens to use it this way.  Its been very good for my console.  I have no problem or what so ever.

"Buyer beware...I have purchased this item multiple times but my most recent order for a 512 gb came with a 128 gb card sealed inside of the packaging.

"Just got this card (sold from and shipped by Amazon), packaging all look genuine. I tested the 128 GB card with Blackmagic Disk Speed Test repeatedly, and the 128 GB card maxes out at just under 90 MB/s read and just over 60 MB/s write. Screenshot attached.

"The reason I like this 32GB microSDHC memory card is the fact that it's made from a reputable electronics come company that manufactures quality and reliable products with its consumers in mind. 🤝I've been using this memory card in my ROAV 2K Dash Camera made by Anker. I first formatted the microSDHC card as recommended by ROAV and it's been working fine. The dash camera has loop recording. Hence, I don't need to keep on removing the card to delete unwanted video recording. Whatever event is important and saved don't get recorded over. The playback speed is fine. Overall, the card has been working fine and I can't complain about issue. 👍 Packaging is appealing. 👍 Keep up the outstanding product quality sale! 🤝",5,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
"Although the Samsung Galaxy S20 has 128GB of on-board storage, it also has a Micro SD Card slot...so why not add one. I did some research and discovered the Samsung EVO Select microSDXC was recommended by several on-line Android sites. This card was probably the best for me. I didn't want or need to run any apps from the card, just for storage of photos, videos and files. It installed easily in about 2 minutes (there are youtube videos for install, setup and moving files). 128GB card I purchased doubled my storage area. I've moved all my photos and video, plus set up my camera to store all newly generated photos and video to the SD card.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0

SKEPTICAL is what I was about the advertised read & write speeds of the Samsung 125GB EVo Select micro SD card.THE TEST. Put the 128GB in a USB adapter and stuck that into my desktop PC which runs Windows 10  with a 4Ghz Intel processor on an ASRock Z370 motherboard and proceeded to use AOMEI Partition Assistant to clone 54GB of data from a backup Samsung 840 Pro SSD.

"While these are great cards and I own more than a dozen, I will NEVER buy another!! I was drawn in by the promise of the warranty. What a load!! This card went out with irreplaceable data on it. It just went out. I contacted cs and was given the runaround and then on a phone call was told I didn't need an RMA#, like a ticket #. Not for their cards. So 3 months after all this back and forth I send it in as told. Several months later I never heard back. Now I'm going back and forth again and nobody wants to help without an RMA#!!!! They keep trying to close my ticket, but they don't know I have saved EVERY message! I have repeatedly demanded a manager but I keep getting blown off.

I got this because I was crazy enough to lose my other 256 gb memory card and needed one that wasn't too expensive but that I knew would work well. I am using this for my Samsung Note S10+ that already has an internal memory of 256gb. I needed more.This worked perfectly for that purpose. I now have all my photos/videos that I take to directly save to this external memory.,5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"Even though Samsung cards have a great reputation and this card was advertised as ""Ultra Fast up to 95 MB/s"" all over its description; my wife's relatively new Motorola smart phone rejected this card as too slow! Further off site research brought to life that it has only a max 20 MB/s write speed. Well after the 3rd try the phone accepted this card and it is indeed running a bit slower than without it. I'm not real well versed on memory cards and did find this ""Ultra Fast"" but too slow Samsung card a bit disappointing.",2,1,2020-4-3,1,2,0
I don't know why some people gave that product a 1 star but the card is really good. I'm using it for my Samsung galaxy a51 phone and it works great,5,1,2020-6-8,1,8,0
I guess I’m going to have to stop buying electronics and electronic accessories on Amazon because you have no way of knowing whether you’ll get a real product or a fake. The real memory card (on the left) has a write speed of three times that of the fake memory card (on the right). They’ve also altered the packaging by putting labels over the printing to mask the 4K UHD video video speeds achievable with an ‘actual’ Samsung card. Notice that the model numbers on both are identical.I’ll be returning this and notifying Amazon of the fakes being sold as actual Samsung cards.,1,1,2020-7-13,1,5,1
I cannot select zero stars or less.Product is a P.O.S!!,1,1,2019-3-17,1,7,0
"Pay attention to the label.  I have the 64GB version and its 5 stars in every way.  I bought the 64GB version because its U3.  So naturally seing the same type of card in 32GB version I would assume it was a U3.  Its not.  That said, I tested it in my panasonic GX85 and it recorded 4k video for 10 minutes without issue.  So my guess is that the performance is still there hence the 4 star rating.  I bought these for use as internal memory in my moto e4.  (Trying to keep the price down, but performance up).Next time for only $8 more its better to just get the 64GB version.",4,1,2017-7-10,1,1,0
Super fast and capacity is as advertised.  One thing I hated is the packaging.  Really difficult to extricate the tiny little card from the Plastic From Hell.  Otherwise I'm quite happy with the purchase.  There are cheaper alternatives to be had do you really want to chance 256Gb of your data to Brand X?,5,1,2020-6-11,1,5,0
"It's important to verify all SD cards to be sure that they are not counterfeit, especially if you buy one from an online auction site. I use a program (free to download) called H2testw (Google it). So I bought this from Amazon and it tested good. Speed tests were OK but not great. Writes were 25 to 30 MB/s and reads averaged 70 MB/s. I had to put this card in a USB adapter to test it on my desktop PC.",4,1,2018-6-20,1,5,1
This card is probably the one of the best you can get for the price and is definitely worth it. I use this card for my switch bought a ton of games and still have about half the space left it's way more than enough. It also the has the same read/write speed as the Sandisk Nintendo branded micro SD cards and those cards cost at most about $100 and only go up to 256gb. Overall this is one of the better deals right now for micro SD cards and you should definitely think about investing in this card.Note: I noticed there were many other review saying that these cards didn't come with the correct amount of storage so I thought I might let everyone know what the high capacity cards actually let you use:,5,1,2020-9-17,1,3,0
"Missed the return window by 5 days over the labor day weekend. Photos started being replaced by grey box with whitr question mark in a white circle on a brand new samsung a21 phone.

I can't give this product five stars yet because I just received it yesterday. I'll come back to this review at a later date and give it five stars if it deserves it.So far I have to say this little camera for the low cost is much better than the Arlo camera I purchased. This YI camera is a dome camera and follows you around which is pretty cool. I bought this to use indoors and I intend to install the Arlo camera outside. The YI camera plugs into any outlet (no batteries) and has one-way and two-way audio.,4,1,2018-12-7,1,1,0
"I don't understand how Samsung can sell this 32GB micro SD card for the insanely low price of $12.99?! No complaints from me, as this card is perfect for adding more space to your smart phone, tablet, digital camera, etc. This card has lightning fast transfer speeds, boasting 95mbps and 20mbps write and read speeds respectfully. This card is compatible with all micro SD devices and regular SD devices with the included card adapter. With an extra 32GB of storage, you no longer have to worry about your memory running low, so feel free to add or install whatever apps, movies, songs and anything else your heart desires. The card also offers 4 point protection, keeping all your data safe from water and other environmental hazards. Just make sure your device can accept the 32GB storage expansion and then you are good to go!

"I've generally had good luck with Samsung memory and drives. Got this one as expandable storage for Microsoft Surface pro 7 tablet.It doesn't have the highest advertised speed rating, but since data transfer rates are limited within the device, this drive makes for sense.

I also have a Lexar 633X, which is supported, and that I've provided as a comparison for some read/write tests.In the pic attached to this review, I've provided screenshots of both cards' CrystalDiskMark benchmark. As one can see, read speeds are near as makes no difference. Write speeds, on the other hand, clearly tilt to the Samsung EVO's favor. It's almost twice as fast as the Lexar 633x SDHC card. Worth noting, is that both of these cards were tested in the same USB 3.0 port.",5,1,2018-9-10,1,0,1

I'd avoided buying the micro-SD cards that Wyze sells, simply because I tend to avoid spending money whenever possible, but I finally gave up on that thriftiness for convenience's sake.This little 32gb card is exactly what I needed for my cam, and it records all day long for me.  I can check the video when I need to figure out what made my dog start suddenly barking (at home alone while I'm at work), or even scroll back to check what time I came in from dropping off a load of laundry.

I've read a lot of these are being bootlegged and ripped off. Where your device will read it's 128Gb or whatever size you buy but in reality they just program it to say something it's not. Sometimes it will be a 16Gb when it read 256Gb or what have you. Supposedly these two tone cartridges are more expensive to to rip off so they are the safer bet to buy. It cost the bootleggers more to create a two tone case than an all black or all white one. I didn't test this one as I got it and opened it while in my car so I stuck it straight into my dash cam and it read 128Gb but whether or not it's real its programmed to say that. I will later on take it inside to my PC and run a test on it to verify it's legit. So for reasons for this review I'm saying it's legit and worth every penny. These have become so much cheaper over the years. It's mind blowing how much data you can hold on such a small device. Gotta love technology.,5,1,2020-7-4,1,2,0
I got super lucky and found a Nintendo Switch without pandemic pricing. Yay! Turns out it was defective but I didn’t know that. I tried and tried to get it to read and recognize this Samsung EVO 512 SDXC card. I was about to return it but decided to try another card and the Switch didn’t recognize that card either. Ended up trying 5 different cards. So I had to return the Switch but I kept the card. Got lucky again and found another switch 2 days later and the card worked perfectly.

There are a lot of Micro storage devices on the market and I am glad I went with the name brand.  I use this in my dash cam.  The cam company recommended Samsung or SanDisk.  I look through a ton of options and the Samsung was in the same price range as the no named ones so I went with it.  could not be happier.  I also was not aware of the U rating on SD cards.  The cam needed a U3 - the one I had at home was a U1.  Apparently it matters because the U1 would not work in my dash cam.

Watched a plethora of YouTube videos on cheaper action cams. Felt pretty good about features to look for and what to expect in rendering the video to publish. It was a little tricky getting it set up and getting all the settings how I wanted. But, the OS on the camera isn't bad and if you mess up a video, erase it and try something else. I did put in a 64 Gb card instead of the 32 Gb. Formatted fine, but I have shot enough to fill it up. So I don't know if it only stores up to 32 Gb, which is what I read in other reviews.  The only complaint is the sticky battery cover. Hard to get off. I had to use a knife to get this off and it scratched the bottom. But, glad it is really on there so the battery doesn't come out! The video is awesome and putting the footage in Movie Maker 10 is super easy. I think I'll probably use Adobe to get more editing features. But, great camera and the quality is really good.

After reading some of the other reviews about fake cards, I checked mine and it has white plastic on the sides and black on the bottom and looks genuine to me.

I didn't buy another one of these when I needed another one due to the low write speed (I thought that might be the issue the first phone had.)

I've been using these in my Raspberry Pi's and they work very well. Plenty of capacity choices to meet your specific needs.

As usual the Samsung Micro SD card I purchased does it's job! The 32GB is the largest I have purchased so far. This card is for my Blu 8L smartphone.

I did not find it as easy to set up as they indicate, and there really is very little portability (from one WiFi to another) unless you go thru the whole set up procedure again.

I ordered this card on two separate occasions. These work great in my security cameras. I believe the continuous rewriting the cameras perform put a heavy load on any sd card.

I bought this because it's highly rated for the raspberry pi.  Every pi I've ever owned eventually ruins the sd card.

"I bought this just to help my wife quickly get her new cellie going.  Naturally, it worked perfectly.  Her and I have a bunch of small, highly portable electronics using Micro SD cards for storage, so when the need arises, I buy the small-capacity Samsung 32 and 64 gigabyte (I started working on and with computers back in the 80s, and can't believe I now can call ANY gigabyte capacity small) sized cards for them.  I was very happy to discover (and start using) these cards long ago, because of the Samsung reputation primarily, and also because they are almost ridiculously inexpensive now on Amazon (and have been for quite some time).  They might not represent blazing fast, cutting edge tech, but they do the job, cost little, and are completely reliable.  Why buy cheap, slow and possibly unreliable no-name cards when Samsung quality is so available, and so affordable?  This is a no-brainer.",5,1,2018-1-14,1,0,0
