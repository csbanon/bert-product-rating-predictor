I opened the box and found the speaker to have greasy marks on it and dirt/shmootz on its underside.  This speaker is used and was returned by someone else.  I didn’t bother syncing/listening through it.  I’m returning this speaker.,1,1,2018-9-9,1,9,1
"This speaker is amazing!  It's a little larger and heavier than its predecessor, of which I bought 2, but that isn't a problem at all. This Angle 3 is superb!  I listen to music with my Echo, but, when in the kitchen, bedroom, etc., I use the OontZ 3 so that I don't have to have my Echo full volume and disturb my roommate!  The range is unbelievable!  I can even take it to the downstairs kitchen and it works great.  The sound that comes from this little speaker is exceptional.  It is a very full, rich sound.  While my Echo has great sound, I actually like the sound from this better.  You are also able to use the volume up/down buttons to go back or forward to the next song.  It has a pause button, also.  The charge lasts a very long time.  I bought this in June.  I use it from 2 - 6 hours a day and I have only recharged it once, but, only to keep it at full charge in case the electricity went out.  How wonderful it is to have a cordless speaker that is this great.  Makes storm power outages much more pleasant!  Power was out for 10 hours, went back out for 6 hours, and, without a charge, it worked perfectly for those 16 hours.  I absolutely love the non-skid rubber on the bottom.  Between my kitties and me, things are always getting knocked around. This speaker doesn't move!  It doesn't even slide easy!  In the kitchen, the OontZ 3 got splashed quite a bit.  The water stayed on the covering and wiped off easy.  Fixing to buy a second one for my roommate!  I LOVE IT!!!",5,1,2017-9-9,1,1,0
"This speaker is very poor quality. I've used it for several months now and get more frustrated every time. I listen to it for about 30-45 minutes at a time. Sometime is works great and sometimes I want to throw it out the window. The issue is with the Bluetooth. Most days, the speaker has little hiccups where it looses Bluetooth connection, pauses the music, and then reconnects. I then have to press play again on my phone. This regularly happens 2-3 times PER song! Incredibly frustrating. I tried using an aux cable to get around the Bluetooth issue, but using an aux cable lowers the overall volume of the speaker significantly. Do not buy!",1,1,2018-9-23,1,6,0
"I do not suggest getting these speakers at all.  The first one I got stopped working within the  first couple months, I had gotten the extended warranty and was sent a replacement,  that one stopped working as well within a couple months.  They sent yet another replacement even though I mentioned my concern that the speakers weren't working after a few months.  The replacement again lasted a few months and stopped.  I wrote the company again and they are saying sorry you're no longer under warranty not our problem.  I will never buy speakers from this company again and suggest others not to, especially when they keep breaking down so quickly and the company says basically yeah we aren't standing behind our product.  Look elsewhere for speakers and know even with extended warranty they won't back up products not even a year old.",1,1,2018-4-16,1,8,0
"Like any product, this speaker has both good and less than good points.  Having just received it, I am limited to immediate experience, although thus far more good than bad:Oontz Angle 3 Speaker (Geez, what a name!) appears well constructed, with good, solid feeling to it; although it isn't at all heavy.  It doesn't have any apparition nor feeling of being loosely constructed, with good and tight fitting rubber seals and grommet for power/hard cable connection port.  It was a bit difficult to get grommet open for charge the first time, but using some blunt tool removes it easy enough...Make sure you don't use anything like a sharp knife or like edged tool, because the rubber grommet could be accidentally cut easily enough when trying to lift it out initially. That's not a point for complaint, because speaker is supposed to be water proof enough to take in the shower, although user pamphlet expressively warns against full submersion.  I as well like the fact the pamphlet is well written, easy to understand in explaining functions and set up, and I am thrilled by the fact it is completely in English; as opposed to multi language documents that are written in several languages at microdot font. It's definitely a high point for me to see the instructions are completely in English, but higher still, designed and engineered in America! It is manufactured in China however (What isn't these days?), and I would have preferred American manufacturing and paid more for it if it was.",5,1,2018-4-28,1,5,0
"Awesome product!! I purchased this for a cross country road trip in an '80s Camaro with a busted radio. It worked great for my cross country trip; I could hear it over road noise and the battery life was sufficient for an 8 hour day.  (The cigarette lighter was also busted so it was important for the battery to last as long as possible.)  The sound quality is also excellent!  It really thumps when you crank it up.  I love this little speaker!  I use it all the time at home, its so portable and again I stress the great battery life.  It goes for quite a while between charges.  I had no problems pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy S6.  I also like the rubber feet it has which made it stay right on the dash where I placed it.",5,1,2017-8-10,1,7,1
"I bought three Bluetooth speakers hoping ONE would be usable.  All three ended up being keepers for different reasons. I bought the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3, the Anker Classic Portable, and the Boombotix REX.Portability:  All three are fantastic, no real difference.  If you want to nitpick, the Boombotix is the smallest, the Anker is next, and the Cambridge is the largest.  But again, none of them are really different.  I give an edge to the Boombotix for it's clip, it's more flexible. The clip is super hard to get open though. You aren't clipping it to anything thick.",4,1,2015-10-23,1,5,0
"Upgraded to this from a smaller and cheaper bluetooth speaker and would never go back. It has played every song at full volume like a champ from hard rock, to trance, throw in some 50's stuff, even some classical and sounds awesome. Work in a commercial kitchen so with exhaust fans going and oven fans blowing my coworkers love to hear the tunes as well and this cuts through the noise without a problem. Very clear from across the kitchen so only complaints I get are when I throw on a song they don't prefer haha. Battery life is as advertised, maybe 4 or 5 hours max if I push it full volume the whole time so keep a backup power source or just keep it plugged in if you got a free outlet somewhere, will obviously last longer with volume lowered, but for the most part it lasts as long as it says. It did fall off a 6 foot shelf a couple times, but survived intact, no cracks anywhere and still sounding just like the first day. The aux port is a nice addition if you need it for older audio sources, i'd rather have it than not. Bluetooth connection has been rock solid for me, never lost a connection once other than when I forget my phone is on me and I walk into one of the walk-in coolers. I love having a button for each function rather than having one share multiple functions, it's just less of a hassle and I appreciate the addition. I have yet to buy another one to try out the dual stereo feature, but i'm sure it works great. Instruction book was nice and detailed. For the price i've been satisfied with this purchase and will look into getting another one if I feel the need to.",5,1,2019-6-10,1,3,0
"This speaker was pretty good when it worked.  After about a month, streaming music and podcasts would just stop / start and whole stretches of playback would just drop out.  Also playback would randomly speed up and slow down.  It just became unusable.  I never dropped it or abused it in any way.  Just set it on the shelf and connected via Bluetooth.  Its not my phone that is causing the problems because I can stream to my BOSE radio all day long with none of the issues I have mentioned here.  Using earbuds are likewise fine.  You definitely get what you pay for with this POS.  Its too late to return it, go I'll just bite the bullet and buy a JBL Bluetooth speaker (that I should have done in the first place).",1,1,2018-12-12,1,4,0
"Well I cross shopped the Oontz Angle 3 and Amazon Basics speaker (the cheaper 2.5-watt speaker from Amazon, NOT the 3W amazonbasics speaker). I was surprised to see no reviews comparing the two since they are a similar price so this experience may help others like myself.I use this with a fire tablet HD8 which we keep in Show mode in the kitchen (the stock speakers on the tablet are terrible).",5,1,2018-8-4,1,3,1
"This is a great little sound box. I've had mine for a little over a year now and I've used it for multiple functions. I initially bought it to use at a park for a memorial bbq since the city wanted a much larger deposit for ""amplified"" sound. Since a speaker doesn't count as amplified sound, I decided go that route. This little guy didn't disappoint and the sound carried well over 50 feet in either direction at half volume without sounding like it was coming out of a coffee can.I wouldn't say it's as great as the higher end sound systems you can buy with a seperate sub woofer, but it works very well for me and it is durable. It has been cranked up pretty loud without damage to the speaker. The Bluetooth connectivity is very quick and simple unless the battery is low. I've had this thing going for about 5 hours and never had to charge it. I've taken it camping and I use it on my patio pretty much every weekend. At low volume it sounds good, at high volume it sounds good. Although, I've found that depending on the surface it sits on, it can sound a little different. So I wouldn't recommend sitting it on hollow metal.",5,1,2018-5-30,1,1,0
"Man, this is tough to review. All 3 do a commendable job given their size and price, and based on that alone I'd give them all 5 stars. Given the sound quality itself, however, I'd say they sounded good but not great, which is why I ultimately gave each of them 4 stars - MAYBE 5 stars for the SoundCore 2. You're definitely trading some sound quality for portability.All 3 seemed well built and solid. The SoundCores were a notch heavier, and while all 3 have an Aux input jack, the SoundCores don't include the cable. The OontZ does. All 3 include a USB-based charging cable but none include a plug-in wall adapter. I thought the OontZ had better/clearer instructions, but they all easily connected to Alexa. Haven't tried anything else yet. The OontZ and SoundCore2 are ""splash"" waterproof, the SoundCore is not. The SoundCores play a short multi-note audio tone when powered on, and when connecting to a bluetooth source, with no apparent way to turn it off, but it was subdued and I didn't find it objectionable. The OontZ is silent. All 3 have raised buttons for power, volume, bluetooth, etc, but I DON'T like that they're all the same color as the case. You either have to shine a light to see them, or fumble around by feel. Annoying and unnecessary. I don't care that making them white or gray or whatever ""ruins the clean lines"" - it's a portable speaker, not a piece of furniture.",4,1,2018-10-28,1,5,0
"Bought this because of the good reviews, but regret my decision.  This was to replace a $7 Sylvania (SP262) bought at Wal-Mart and I'd much rather have the Sylvania.  The Cambridge has no bass.  Sure its smaller and more compact than the previous but sound quality is lacking.I can't comment on battery life or longevity as I really don't like using this speaker.  I would not recommend this speaker.",1,1,2017-7-28,1,1,0
"I needed a small blue tooth speaker because the Echo Dot sound quality just wasn't cutting it and i would like to add music to whatever room I am working in that may not have a device. I have an Echo Dot 2nd and 3rd gen. The 2nd gen is tinny and the 3rd way too bass centric and boomy, but still better than this speaker. The sound quality doesn't blow me away, in fact, it is pretty bad. Not enough bass and not much of an improvement over my Echo Dot Mini 2nd Gen. Wow, this is so disappointing. The speaker paired easily with my phone and laptop, but had an issue pairing with the Alexa app via blue tooth. The controls are a pain to see in low light. As long as you keep your expectations super low you will be happy.----Update-----",1,1,2019-1-5,1,1,0
"Will not charge after 30 days old and Amazon ""return date expired"" now I know why! Amazon should read and stop selling !The company behind this product DID contact me and REPLACED the unit with an upgraded model! Thank you Cambridge SoundWorks!",1,1,2018-7-30,1,2,0
"The battery in my ancient Bose Soundlink Mini II will no longer hold a charge so it was time to buy a really expensive new battery or just replace the speaker.  I bought the Oontz Angle 3 because of the ""rich bass"" and ""crystal clear stereo sound"" hype, the overwhelming number of excellent reviews, the small footprint and the crazy low price.The Angle 3 arrived fully charged so I plugged it into a music source (my desktop computer) and fired up some tunes.  ""Rich bass?""  Puhleez.  The sound was harsh, tinny and decidedly bass-free.  And if there was any ""crystal clear stereo"" separation going on it completely escaped me.  I actually grabbed the instructions to find out if I needed to enable something, download the latest drivers, anything...this couldn't be the same product.",2,1,2019-4-30,1,1,0
"Why some might think it has crappy sound, and how to fix it (Not an issue with the speaker!)...The speaker has two modes... phone calls or music. If the device you are connecting to uses its ""Mic"", it will use the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode. The quality of the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode is sub-par. Good for phone calls, sucky for music. If the device you connect it to recognizes it as an audio device, the audio quality is WAY better, I mean night and day, but has no Mic functionality. I use it as an audio device, and I do not use its Mic functionality. If you use it with a computer, you may have to disable the hands free functionality in the Control panel > Sound (See images) to get good audio from it and to use it as a speaker. So basically it depends how the device you connect it to handles it. My Pixel 2 sees it as an audio device, and I get great quality when listening to music, then it switches over to ""Hands Free"" mode and it sounds like any other hands free Bluetooth speaker...",5,1,2019-4-5,1,1,1
"I bought this speaker because I was looking for a relatively inexpensive speaker that I can use in the shower. I was looking at a few speakers but eventually decided on the OobtZ because of its features, price and sheer amount of positive feedback. In this review I will focus on the pros and cons that make this speaker a good choice for a speaker under $30.Starting off the shipping was fast as expected. I opened the box and got a fairly simple unvoxing with a charger, manual and 3.5 chord which I was very happy about because many speakers don't come with one. It came with a mostly full battery which was nice.  Initial thoughts on sound were as follows: It has a decent bass for the price and has mids and highs that were clear but a bit crunchy (especially at high volumes). It gets loud enough for a small rom and most certainly a shower or bathroom. Aesthetically it is very slick with a metal grill and rubber endcaps. The size also lends to excellent portability. The controls are easy to use and pairing was very simple. So to sum it all up I will list my personal pros and cons when using the speaker.",4,1,2017-5-30,1,4,1
"I've had other speakers and they always combine the track skip and volume buttons....this one doesn't.  Its about time in my mind as there's nothing more frustrating than trying to increase/decrease the volume and skipping forward or back in your audio book or podcast.  We've been using this while we do yard work and I even brought it with me when I rented a truck for a 3hr drive.  Its plenty loud for a car/truck cabin, and in my opinion loud enough when you're doing work in the yard, but this will not power a party.  Connects to my phone every time I turn it on so no issues there.",4,1,2019-6-3,1,1,0
"The sound quality and overall functionality of the device isn't bad. However, the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. I say this because the case of the speaker melted and warped. Yes, this really happened. The speaker, which I was using in place of my broken aux port, literally cannot withstand the direct sunlight on a hot day. The case of the speaker began melting and is now warped. There is now a noticeable difference in the quality of audio. Aditionally, the battery is maintaining far fewer hours of charge. That is of course, when it charges. Which, I'm sure, is do to the fact that the case melted and is now warped. Did I mention that the case melted and warped? That all being said, if you intend to use this in your car or next to a fire while camping (or a heat source and etc.), do not. In fact, if you aren't in the frigid indoors just save yourself the trouble and don't use it. I say this because your speaker will likely warp due to it melting.I will be adding a few photos to this review in a couple hours when the chance arises.",1,1,2019-7-9,1,5,0
"There is a total of one moving part on this product.  That is the speaker.  Electronics, if properly designed and using quality components should last decades.  Unfortunately this product lacks both qualities. Cheap Chinese components rendered the power section  inoperable so that it will neither charge the battery nor operate while plugged into a power source.  Lasted about a year.  They should sell this product in the Dollar Stores.  I have stereo components purchased 45 years ago that are still working fine today.  As is par for the course in the US, people make their purchase decisions on cost not value. This product is a perfect example of that policy",1,1,2019-10-4,1,4,0
"I was so happy when I received this. The set up was SUPER-EASY. I was able to power up by just pressing a button, I pointed it at my iphone -- PRESTO! -- the baby instantly paired on bluetooth, no fiddling around to keep pressing buttons or whatever!!! LOVED THAT. The sound is quite loud and it solves my wake up routine now because I can listen to my playlists for what I want to hear and not the damn radio playing ads and talking all time and playing the same songs over and over again (you know what I mean!). This portable speaker comes with its own charge cord so I plugged it into charging the day I got it (it comes out of the package part-way already charged). I did need to top up the charge so it'll give me 12 hours of playing time at 2/3 volume which is fine by me. I bought separately a connector cable so I can play sound directly out of my home desk computer (which is primitive and stupid with no bluetooth but the recommended 3.5mm Audio Cable connected them up (the cable was an Amazon Basics brand with a ""male connector jack"" on each end). And... PRESTO AGAIN! -- I could play sound off my non-bluetooth desk computer. CHEERS! Look, I am so happy becuase this was easy, gave me good sound, had the options I needed for bluetooth AND a stupid low-tech computer set up AND it cost me very little. Yay! I've gone from audio deprived and starved to heaven -- and I can even exercise with NO ear buds that keep falling off of my ears anyway!!!!  This speaker has a loud volume output for being so small! It's about the size of a small coffee cup (gosh!) and I can slide it into my tote and take it anywhere and everywhere! Thank you OONTZ. You guys are brilliant and thought of everything.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,2,0
"I love this speaker.  I've had it for about three months and have used it several times before writing this.  I love music and really want a quality Bluetooth speaker with a well-rounded sound.  This OontZ delivers.  It has a great sound with a nice low end.  Of course, it doesn't have a deep end like a separate subwoofer, but you can hear the bass notes really well.  I play bass guitar and want to hear the low end.  This speaker delivers really well.  The controls are easy to use and I have had no problems connecting to my iPhone or iPad.  The battery life is great as well.  It will last all day long.This speaker really shines when it is set on a flat, solid surface as the bass comes from the bottom.  It loses the low end if it is carried in your hand or just tossed on a bed or placed outside on the grass.  If it is placed on any solid surface the speaker produces a fantastic tone.  I own a DOSS Touch Bluetooth speaker and a Bose Soundlink Bluetooth speaker.  The Oontz outperforms the DOSS hands down based off of controls, sound (when placed on a flat surface) and simplicity of use.  The DOSS does sound great and is not dependent on placement nearly as much as the Oontz, but I prefer the Oontz.  The Bose does sound better than this Oontz with similar controls but not by much.  And the price of the Oontz is much better.  If money were no problem and sound quality was the top priority, I would pick the Bose over this speaker.  But considering you could purchase at least four of these Oontz speakers for the price of one Bose, the Oontz wins hands down. It sounds great, has a long battery life, connects easily and does NOT have an annoying series of beeps like the DOSS when connecting to your phone.",5,1,2018-3-1,1,5,0
"I wanted a small device that played my music and that I could carry around with me in the house or outside in the garden. I was looking at devices that cost almost $200.00 and at the last minute changed my mind after I spoke with a friend who recommended I get a Bluetooth compatible device. So I went on Amazon and began looking for such a product when I saw OontZ Angle 3 product with, get this, 35,000 reviews.........that's not a typo...35,000 reviews. OK that was amazing but then I saw the price $25.99. I thought that MUST be a mistake! I also thought how good could this product be for $25.99 but I also thought if that many people liked this item then I should order it and see. WOW, I loved it and after 4 days ordered ANOTHER for my wife with the Blue color (it comes in 5 colors). The sound is wonderful with a lovely bass, I can be up to 100 feet and still have a Bluetooth connection, it is so simple to use has twin speakers and is less than 6 inches long. Cambridge Products has hit a grand slam with this product and its price point. Go out and buy it...................its that good.",5,1,2019-7-12,1,4,1

"Purchased this speaker to play music during work. We stream background music in the office, low volume. This speaker's sound is somewhat tinny with very little bass at low volume.  It sounds better as you crank it up but even then doesn't provide the richness of some other portable speakers.  I've played it both bluetooth and accessory cord and both sound equivalent.  I do love its size and ease of use. It paired with both my phone and laptop flawlessly. Volume controls are simple and functional. Charging is easy and the battery life at low volume is easily 10+ hours. And, importantly, its sized to fit in my briefcase as I travel to different offices.  Still, I was hoping for a better sound quality.  I listened to another speaker, longer but narrower, that had a much richer sound and frequency response. It also cost about twice as much as this Oontz 3.Spend a little more, get a fair bit more. Probably worth it if you listen a lot.",3,1,2018-11-7,1,4,0
"Any speaker at this size is way too small to give you REAL BASS, instead look for a speaker that is Loud. I noticed all small speakers sort of dim down the volume when the base hits & is probably becase they run on battery & there's not enough power to keep that constance bass. Save your money & get the OontZ Angle 3 Enhanced.If you must have some unreal-bass then look at all of the ones below except #1,8,9 from the list below:",5,1,2018-12-10,1,5,0
"I took this on vacation with a big group of friends and it got a ton of use.  It went to the beach with us, it was out on the deck, etc. constantly.  I used it myself, let my friends connect to it and so on.Connection - easy.  Paired it to probably 5 different phones over the course of the week and nobody had any trouble hooking up to it, and it seemed to keep a solid connection even when there was a good distance between the phone and the speaker.  There is no security code and it shows up as Oontz Angle on your phone so it is obvious what it is.  It gives a chime to tell you it has successfully paired, so it is very easy to manage.  It will automatically pair to the last device connected to it if it finds it in range when you turn it on.",5,1,2016-3-7,1,1,0
"I have the older OontZ Ultra-Portable Wireless speaker. This unit is a replacement. It's a great speaker, with many of the Oontz features, but updated for better performance. The sound quality is better than my previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange. I use this as a bedroom speaker for relaxation and sleeping sound tracks like ocean and forest sounds. The volume is great and has plenty of range and power for the room. The sound quality doesn't suffer at higher volumes. I listen to ambient sounds as I mentioned above as well as acoustic guitar and blue grass. I've been pleased with the sound quality for that type of music. I've used the speaker outside on my deck at a picnic table and it had plenty of power to fill the area. Many people describe sound quality from these type of speakers as ""tinny"" or weak, however this speaker is not like that. A great feature of the speaker is the hands free calling feature. This works seamlessly when the speaker is paired with my phone (iPhone 6+) and I'm pleased with the call sound and the microphone. The company claims this speaker is redesigned to be more powerful and have deeper bass. I agree with that claim, however my expectations are aligned with a speaker of this type and size. You should not be expecting sound like you would get from larger stereo speakers. My recommendation for the BEST performance and sound quality is to also download a high quality Equalizer App for your iPhone and use it when playing your music. The app I use is called ""Equalizer"" from Audioforge. My previous Oontz was difficult to pair, but pairing this speaker is quick and easy. The annoying blue light that was located on the front of the older Oontz has been relocated to the side panel of this speaker. My experience with battery life is about 7 -12 hours between charges. However, I would like a longer charging cord. The included USB cord is quite short (6 inches) and has to located directly near the power source. The speaker does not come with a wall charger. A 3.5 mm, 32 inch audio cable is included.  This speaker is designed to be water proof and as such the controls are on the sealed, silicone end panel and have raised ridges to help you locate them. The charging port and 3.5 mm jack port are located on the back panel of the speaker under a tight, silicone flap that's just a bit tricky to open. The sealed power button is directly above the ports. The front panel is a typical metal, perforated grill. The bass radiators are on the bottom panel along with nonskid silicone feet. Overall, I enjoy this speaker, I am pleased with its performance, the sale price was low compared to the quality and features and Cambridge is a known, established, American company. I've contacted Cambridge customer service and received prompt and expert service. The Cambridge website has plenty of resources and information as well. If you need a quality, portable speaker with great performance, give this one a try.",4,1,2016-12-10,1,1,0
"I’ve had this speaker for almost 2 months now.

"SOUND: The sound produced blows away the competition.  Built by Cambridge Soundworks, this small speaker somehow fills up a room.  Deep bass you can feel.DESIGN & OPERATION: Straight forward operation.  Sync was easy and no problems.

When connected directly with cable to different device the sound is okay ***Almost everything else about this thing is great, built well, decent feature set, price but the one thing that matters (at least to me) above all else is sound quality. It is truly poor.

"This is the second Oontz I bought (the first one being the Oontz plus, the older and bigger version). This speaker worked well initially, although I found the sound is not as crisp as the bigger version. About one month later, the plastic strip that covers the power button and USB port fell off. It made it looks kind of ugly. Aside from that, it made powering on/off the speaker very annoying because it relies you to press the plastic strip to power on/off it. Without the plastic strip, you have to use a small pin to push the little button inside a hole to turn on/off it.Worse thing, now the speaker's battery is completely dead. No matter how long you charge it through USB port, it does not have any power. Essentially, it is a dead speaker. I kind of noticed that the speaker's play time lasted shorter and shorter. But I did not really pay attention as I though I did not charge long enough. Now it is completely dead and useless.",1,1,2017-8-30,1,1,0

Excellent battery life and no hassle at all pairing to my phone.We used the second one yesterday and paired it to the first...

"The Oontz Angle 3 is the best selling bluetooth speaker on Amazon and after trying others in the same price range, one can can see why. The sound is loud, clear and well balanced requiring no eq. On some songs the treble can be a bit forward sounding but for the most part it is stable. The bass is passable but nothing special. The sound quality of the Angle 3 is better than most of the competitors I have tried in this price range.Out-of-the-box the Angle 3 came with 30% charge enabling me to test it immediately. Battery life is reasonable, shows up in iOS and is in check with the specifications printed on manufacturer’s website.",3,1,2019-8-26,1,8,1
"I actually love this speaker, the sound is really quite good. My problem is that it has stopped talking to Alexa, period. Did they have a fight? Have they broken up? seriously, I've tried everything, all the trouble shooting tips and nothing works, just endless blinking blue light and Alexa giving up finally. Bummed, cuz I was lovin on this little speaker....****UPDATE****",5,1,2017-10-7,1,7,0
"Just opened the box - When it comes to quality sound from small speakers I am very skeptical. Distortion and flat sound is typical from tiny speakers - well I have been proven wrong - today's technology is truly amazing. After several months of research into bluetooth portable speakers I finally pulled the trigger on this awesome speaker from Cambridge Soundworks and my mind, and ears - are just blown away.The Oontz 3 is a small 12 hour battery or wall powered Bluetooth stereo speaker with AMAZING CLARITY and BASS - even played at high volume there is NO DISTORTION  - simply fills the room and crystal clear sound - you can answer phone calls, use direct AUX in and even take it into the shower with you.. it's water resistant.",5,1,2017-8-14,1,6,0
"For what you pay and how compact this awesome little speaker is, the sound and value are amazing.I bought this to replace my portable iHome speakers that finally bit the dust. It's worth noting that those died in part because of on/off switches that would often accidentally slip on in luggage, ruining the battery; they also had rather cumbersome wires.",5,1,2018-4-11,1,4,0
"As with many items I purchase, I look carefully at the customer reviews on Amazon.  In this case, I was snookered!  After using this speaker for about a month, I have come to the conclusion that there is no way almost 36,000 people would give this 4.5 stars; something is amiss.  I should have followed the adage of ""if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't"". In this case, the reviews are not close to reality.I purchased this speaker hoping to save a few bucks over the cost of another speaker like the Wonderboom speaker another member of our family has.  I was immediately disappointed in this OontZ Angle 3 for two reasons.  Most importantly, the sound produced by the speaker is no better than the sound produced by my I phone 8.  There is very little base sound and ""tinny"" overall sound is VERY disappointing. I don't consider myself a sound aficionado, nor do I consider myself a speaker snob; I just want a good full sound from a speaker.  Also, this speaker's volume is only able to be controlled by the phone so if the phone is not immediately available, there is no way to lower, or increase, the volume.",1,1,2019-7-26,1,4,0
"So I needed a bluetooth speaker and got sucked into buying this speaker because of 50K reviews and almost 4.5 stars rating. My first impression after looking at the rating was wow !!! this must be one good speaker so I should buy one. After receiving the speaker I was extremely dissapointed with the sound Quality. It sounds like a cheap dollar store speaker. You can hear Bass but really weak bass without any depth. And the worst part is treble. Treble is so much that it hurts my ear. I have no idea how it ended up getting 50K reviews and 4.5 stars. May be those people got free speakers in change for a 5 star review or something. I paired it with Galaxy S20. Any ways ... i am returning this speaker. Another thing i noticed, its a Chinese made cheap speaker but the company has an American name ""Cambridge Soundworks"". They claim they are designed in USA but made in China. Please note , they are not assembled in China but actually made in China. The name is very misleading.",1,1,2020-3-26,1,3,0

"I just received this speaker today and so far I love it. I was disappointed at first by the volume which I kept trying to turn up on the speaker (yeah, I know, stupid of me). The volume limit is apparently set by the app on my phone. Once I got that sorted I really enjoyed this speaker. The sound doesn't compare with real full size speakers but is great (greater than it's size would suggest).I have ended up with some junk and unpleasant surprises from Amazon but this speaker is great so far. If it burns out early or keels over I will be back.",5,1,2019-3-7,1,1,0
"I've had this speaker for months and I loved it (previously 5*) . Recently it stopped charging and holding a charge so it has become useless. I would love to order a replacement but I'm not sure if I have confidence in this item.  Seen other reviews also saying that unit stops charging.  Do not buy this item!This is a great speaker, hands down.  Lightweight, unbelievable sound for its size and price.  I would recommend for anyone on the go who like to listen to music that's not the tinny sound that a smartphone makes.",1,1,2016-5-13,1,3,0
"This is a compact Bluetooth speaker at a good price. It paired quickly and effortlessly with my iPhone. I use it for listening to audio books and the sound is fine. Between the iPhone volume and the speaker volume the output is loud enough for my needs. I can’t comment on music quality or whether the speaker is loud enough to fill a room or be heard above a lot of ambient noise or conversation. HOWEVER:  the product listing caption says it has a range of 100ft. I sort of knew that was too good to be true but hey, they couldn’t say it if it wasn’t true, right? Apparently they can. Not only does it not have a 100ft range, it drops the signal as soon as I leave the room where my phone is. I have $10 wireless speakers from discount stores that work on the other side of my house. If you want an  inexpensive nice sounding Bluetooth speaker and don’t need to stray far from the audio source, buy this one. If you need wireless range, pick something else.",3,1,2018-9-16,1,9,0
I enjoy almost every aspect of this GREAT little speaker! I’ve had to think of a way to review the Bluetooth speaker. I would have enjoyed richer bass range but I understand that this is hard to pull off in such a small speaker while providing such great sound from the rest of the wonderful recreation of the experience.The speaker connects almost instantly. I can’t turn of the source before it’s connected.,5,1,2020-4-20,1,4,0
"I couldn't really tell you how well this product functions because, unlike the new product I thought I ordered, I was sent a ""speaker"" that was apparently well used. It had accumulated the kind of gunk in the speaker grill that takes at least months if not years to collect, as well as a tremendous amount of scratches around the charging port. Someone connected this and disconnected this quite a few times. Worst of all, it can't be charged.",1,1,2019-6-30,1,8,1
"This product was laughable! After all the positive reviews that I read on Amazon I thought I would give it a try. Should’ve followed my first instincts!  You get what you pay for and this is no exception. This sounds like the speakers that come with those old-school alarm clocks. I literally laughed out when I played it and I am no way near being an audiophile.  I don’t know who wrote all those positive reviews but either people have low expectations or something very odd is going on because this is laughable.  Also, there was some weird rattling noise.  It’s going back!",1,1,2018-7-18,1,1,0
"I bought this to replace a more expensive speaker which I use at work.  Having left the other one (JBL Flip 2) there it was eventually blown out by someone else, so I wanted to bring in something cheaper so I wouldn't care when it ends up getting ruined by inconsiderate people.The speaker is very light compared to the Flip 2.  The triangle design is much better in terms of preventing the unit from rolling off of whatever surface it's on.  It is overall not as wide as I imagined it would be.  It feels a little cheap but produces pretty good sound at a pretty good volume.  I find it a bit amusing that they would single out ""more bass"" right in the title of the item listing because that's the biggest difference I have heard so far between this and the Flip 2; the OontZ Angle does a passable job on bass heavy audio but it's nowhere near what you would get with something of higher quality like the Flip or a Bose Mini.",5,1,2017-11-8,1,8,0
"For the money, I didn't really expect a lot from this little speaker. Which, in the overall scheme of things, is good because I wasn't disappointed when it failed to deliver the sound quality as advertised. Granted, every manufacturer of these things promises ""room-filling sound with clear, crisp highs and lows, and booty-shaking bass,"" and no one actually delivers on this promise. It would just be nice if, for a change, one actually did.Overall, I am not unhappy with this purchase. It does what I needed it to do: connect to my iPhone to stream music to it in small rooms and once in a while outdoors on my small deck. However, if  you plan to host a party or something and use this as the sound system, you're in for a major disappointment.",3,1,2019-10-17,1,2,0
"I bought this speaker for my workshop to listen to book tapes and music while working. The sound quality is very good. The Anker speaker I previously bought is also good, but I felt it had too much base and speech on it was hard to understand. The Angle 3 has a crisp sound that makes speech easy to understand. I also bought the zipper case to hold the Angle 3 and protect it from dust while not in use. Overall I would recommend this for anyone looking for a small bluetooth speaker. I have not used the speaker long enough for the battery to need recharging so I cannot comment on how long it lasts, but I have used it for over four hours with no problems.",3,1,2019-7-12,1,4,0
"Well, usually I do better buying things from Amazon. I really should have checked the size, it is pretty small. I am not sure how other reviewers can say it has great sound. I found it sounding ""tinny"", not much in the base department. It is loud but can get then distortion. Otherwise, It was easy to set up and works properly. Since returning it at this price point is a bother, I will keep it and find some use for it, but I will likely buy a better one. Added Note 5/31/18: article in Washington Post some weeks ago suggests bluetooth speakers have been a significant target of fraudulent reviews which I think explains clearly why the reviews are grossly inflated. Buyer beware.",2,1,2018-1-1,1,6,0
"This product is terrible. It cut off while watching videos. It deserves NO STARS.  And speaker connector didn’t fit well so there was static. I complained and they sent a replacement. Still didn’t work...AND NOW NO SPEAKER CONNECTOR.  The only way I had transmission was if I plugged it into my iPad and it acted as a dumb speaker.  I thought the sound was tinny.  Amazon reps were clueless and poor  communicators. They didn’t give me proper credit.  So frustrating  .....DONT  BUY. i got info from Cambridge and  still didnt work. THEY BLAMED AN APPLE  UPDATE OR SOMETHING. Also  they say the battery has to be fully charged. But no way to measure charge. Five hours should be enough. I am now connecting videos ON MY iPad  to a lovely portable Bose product I bought to use with my old iPod, which I’ve lost. That’s good sound.!But not wireless.  I’m sadly disappointed in the product AND the Amazon reps. Yuk . The last rep was smart and knowledgeable but then we were cut off. I’ve spent hours trying to unravel this problem and on the phone.",1,1,2019-1-22,1,3,0
"I ordered the OontZ Angle 3 in August, 2018, and connected it in October, 2018.  It worked great, and has a clear sound for what I was using it for (podcasts and audiobooks).  The problem is that I can't get the micro-USB cord to stay in the charging port, it seems to have a bent connection pin.  I don't know if it's my fault, since it is recessed, and shouldn't need any special things to plug it in (I've had other micro-USB connectors that are still working well after 5 years), but I can't charge it any more.Because I like the size and the sound when it did work, I did purchase another one.  I'm bummed that the warranty is only 90 days.  I hope the replacement unit lasts a lot longer than 5  months, if not, this will be the last Cambridge Soundworks bluetooth speaker I buy.",2,1,2019-4-6,1,3,0
"I purchased this item in 2017 to use with my fire tablet--and it works fine-- I have seldom used the speaker though --as the sound quality for music could be better--yes you can get lots of volume, but the sound ,sounds like big sound trying to get out of a little speaker( a bit tin sound also as some of the TV problem speakers)--and there are no bass or sound adjustments--I have paired it also with my PC sound blaster card and still not able to get rid of the tin sound--the best little speaker I have used was the Satechi mp3 player --great and big sound quality( and you could connect many of them for even MORE sound---but they seemed to stopped making them--it was the best little speaker( and it mp3 player and could use sd cards)tv",2,1,2019-4-3,1,3,0
"Bought March 10, 2018 and the speaker doesn't turn on any more. Not sure what happened but now it is a paper weight. I am now doing research to see if there is some sort of warranty...more to follow to see how their customer service is.  The speaker was pretty great until it stopped working. It had a pretty long rechargeable battery life and the sound was decent...a little lacking base but it still had that deep rich sound for its size.",1,1,2018-12-3,1,5,0
This is my second Oontz. I bought one for a small TV in my kitchen last year and returned this year to buy one for the small 19” TV I just added in my basement. This little guy packs a big punch and is a great value for the price.  I am not a crazy audiophile here to pick apart every aspect of this unit.  All I can say is that for the purposes of my application...just boosting the volume from a small TV...this is AWESOME!,5,1,2019-1-6,1,6,0

"Back about 2005-2010 when mini Bluetooth speakers used to be the new toy everyone wanted (and you paid the price to be an early adopter) I was really into the fad and couldn’t stop looking for the perfect one. As a result I ended up with more of them than most dealers, speakers of every possible shape and gimmick. Some of them were knock your socks off impressive, including some so small I could stuff them in my carry on when I traveled so I could have music in my hotel rooms.These days there are a handful left from the major brands. One of them I was curious about was this series from Cambridge SoundWorks, a company I’ve known and respected since I worked directly with their founder Henry Kloss back in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Unlike the early days of Bluetooth mini speakers this little speaker was only nineteen bucks, probably the lowest I’ve ever paid for any speaker. I had mixed expectations. But I chose it both for its size and its shape, I was looking for a small personal speaker to put on the base of my desktop monitor to be able to listen to content at low volume without using my high-end Boston Acoustics system.",4,1,2018-9-16,1,1,1
Stopped connecting via bluetooth after 6 months. Tried all troubleshooting options including the reset button inside the 3.5mm port. All of my other bluetooth devices connect like they should.  I had 2 Cambridge Soundworks 765 tabletop radios that both stopped working properly also....

"I have had this speaker for several months, and it is fantastic. It's very small, with a similar footprint as a cellphone, and the build quality is shockingly good, with a metal grill, high quality plastics, and nice silicone end pieces.It has excellent sound with surprisingly good bass. I have started using it as a practice amp for my electric bass and it sounds good, though it does distort if I play loudly on the lowest string. It would work perfectly as a small guitar amp. The big surprise is the sheer volume, though - it has annoy your neighbor kind of volume in a tiny package. It is very slightly quieter than a good set of desktop speakers on maximum volume, enough to hurt if you're sitting right next to it.",5,1,2018-11-10,1,3,0
"I ordered this to use when hunting, so that I could play predator calls from my phone via bluetooth. I live in western Washington, so naturally it needed to be waterproof; I wanted to be able to carry it easily in a backpack, so it needed to be small and light; and I wanted to be able to setup at least 20 yards away from the speaker. So far, so good - this speaker is very small, relatively light, waterproof, and has good range.Unfortunately, for my needs at least, it's just not very loud. 50 feet away I can hear it ... mostly. It would probably be fine for indoor use. But it's nowhere near loud enough to attract predators from any distance. I'm gonna try something different, and give this one to my kids.",3,1,2019-4-2,1,2,0
"I bought this portable speaker to play music when we go to the beach, an upcoming rafting trip, upcoming camping trip etc. I was immediately surprised by the size of this speaker - it's much smaller than I thought it would be - which is great in my books as that adds to portability. Secondly, I played a song on it (Despacito) and Luis Fonsi absolutely killed it on these speakers! It was LOUD and clear. Bass was beautiful too. Pairing with my iPhone literally took seconds.Now with my camping and rafting trips a few weeks out, I placed this speaker in my home office while still paired with my phone. I got an incoming call and it unintentionally went to this speaker. Call quality and volume = beautiful. But what really surprised me was that the built in mic works great too! If any of you work from home and take phone calls/conference calls - this little speaker will quickly become your best bud. I have a landline that i use to make phone calls primarily because of the speakerphone - i no longer need that as using this speaker in conjunction with my phone is the ultimate combo.",5,1,2017-7-25,1,3,1
"I previously owned an oontz angle 2. I was blown away by the sound quality, particularly the bass which a $25 speaker was able to produce. At high volume, it would often walk itself around my counter or off my desk.  Unfortunately it stopped working after about 11 months of use.  While this was disappointing, I felt like I still got my money's worth out of that purchase, so when looking for a replacement, I decided Oontz would be worth a second try.  I opted to go for the waterproof version this time.  While the sound is not quite as clear and consistent as the 2nd gen,  the bass is just as powerful and I feel the tradeoff for the peace of mind knowing it will be fine if it gets splashed or rained on makes up for it.  I hope this one lasts longer than my previous one,  but for $25 I'd consider this speaker to be more than worth that chance.Update** the vibrato that the speaker produces has become annoyingly noticeable now. Im not sure id it's gotten worse or now I'm listening for it more.",2,1,2019-6-12,1,2,0
"I was skeptical about this speaker at first but overall I'm pretty happy with it. It gets a lot louder than I expected and was even loud enough for my small wedding reception. The sound quality is fantastic as well. I only have 2 complaints about it.1. It takes an eternity to fully charge, and then the battery drains way faster than I'd like it to (about 3 hours of constant use).",3,1,2017-11-7,1,4,0
"DKnight ($28.99) vs  OontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker ($24.99).(I also tested the Kunodi Outdoor Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker,Wireless Portable Mini Shower Travel Speaker with Subwoofer$14.99. Not even in the same league).",5,1,2017-12-31,1,2,0
"All the 5 star reviews on this speaker claiming that it has great sound quality are pretty deceiving for those looking for decent sound. This is a pretty poor speaker. At low volume it sounds hollow with no fullness to the sound. It's not much better at higher volumes as the treble is harsh and the mids start to blend together. It's very fatiguing to listen to for extended periods.It connects easily and I never had any pairing problems so that at least works well. This would be something that I might take on a camping trip and not worry about destroying. I would suggest doing some research and spending more on a better speaker. You will thank yourself in the end. I own several bluetooth speakers now that I spent quite a bit more on, but they were worth the extra money. However, if you just want something cheap to take on a trip and you don't care if it gets lost or stolen, then this might work out.",2,1,2017-1-7,1,4,0
"Okay, so, every once in a while I get suckered and this is one of those times. Normally, I sort these things out and avoid the minefields of dubious products that promise big, but deliver small.Yes, this is a Bluetooth speaker, and yes, it does pair up and play music from your device, but to claim that the sound quality is anywhere near ""good"" is stretching things. There are some Bluetooth​ speakers that make you wonder just how someone managed to make so much sound come out of such a small device. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those. It sounds ""okay,"" but there is nothing about it that is going to amaze you in ANY way. Yes, it plays music, but don't expect it to amaze you in any way. It plays music like any small speaker would, but nothing more...or less, to be fair.",2,1,2018-9-13,1,9,0
"Ordered this speaker less than a year ago (May 2017). It has since stopped working - no sound comes out of speaker when auxiliary cord is used. Bluetooth never worked. You certainly get what you pay for with this product.

"I almost forgot about this product as I threw it away quite a while a go.It came quickly and sounded pretty good ...  for a few months. The problem (and it shares this with many electronic devices) is the USB charging port. The USB port is flimsy. Very flimsy. Soon I had to ""jiggle"" the cord to get it to change, then no amount of finagling would get it to work",1,1,2017-12-15,1,8,0
"I did a lot of research before choosing this speaker. I was impressed by the large number of 5 star buyer ratings. The price was excellent as well. Speaker came packaged perfectly. Included was a 3 foot Micro-USB charging cable and 3 foot 3.5mm audio cable; I wish these were longer but that is just my personal preference. Speaker came partially charged. Instructions states it can be used while charging. Speaker pairs easily and quickly, but I did experience problems getting it to disconnect from one device to pair to a different source. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond back to me. Their customer service was excellent, fast, relevant and courteous. They even offered to call me to assure that the device was working properly or not. After working with it a few days the device started working as expected and has not had an issue ever since. Maybe it was user error? Not sure. I also ordered the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS. The Angle 3 PLUS offers 30 hours of playtime vs the Angle 3 which only offers 7 hours (a big difference). The Angle 3 PLUS is a tad taller at 6 1/2"". The Angle 3 is 5 1/4"", see attached photos. I didn't notice a sound quality difference but my musician son did. He ordered the 3 PLUS and says it is a better speaker than his Jawbone Bluetooth Speaker for less than half the cost. I use the smaller speaker, which sets on a high shelf in my shower, as it is water resistant & splash proof. The other sets on my office desk. If you are considering purchasing a Bluetooth speaker definitely consider the OontZ. I would go for the Angle 3 PLUS as the price difference is only about $7 unless a smaller speaker is your goal. I have referred several people to this powerful little speaker and all are very happy with their purchase.",5,1,2017-5-19,1,1,1
"Bought this less than four months ago. The first speaker I received was defective straight out of the box. Cambridge customer service was very responsive and sent a replacement free of charge. The second speaker worked great for about three months, sounded great, appeared to be durable, very handy as hands-free phone connection in an older vehicle. Used it outside working in yard, in the shower, at my desk, without issue. Then one day it simply quit connecting via Bluetooth. I guess it works via wired connection but haven't tried. Bought it for its Bluetooth capability which is now gone. Just figured it would last longer, guess I should have listened to the negative reviews.",1,1,2017-9-8,1,3,0
"Best speaker I've ever purchased. Great sound, loud, battery lasts longer than any other speaker I've had. 4 months later, we ran it over - twice with Chevy 2500 & then the trailer. :( GUESS WHAT! It still works! INCREDIBLE! I wish I could upload a video. Just bought 2 more!",5,1,2017-3-26,1,4,1
"I never write reviews but had to since this one had so many positive reviews and I had a bad experience. I purchased on 11/27/16.  it was easy to pair with multiple devices (iPhone 6 and kindle fire), but bluetooth would not maintain connectivity from even 1 inch away on either device.  I didn't have the same issue with a braven or jambox speaker.  it kept popping and skipping over and over and finally I stopped using bluetooth and used aux cable instead.  that led to another issue.  the aux cable connection has ridiculous static.  I tried 3 diff aux cables and two diff devices and the same result: background static when playing music.  to me, this device is not reliable enough.  I probably should've returned it but it was so cheap I just dealt with it.  it is hard wired to an MP3 player to play white noise in a kids bedroom.  that's all its good for.",1,1,2017-7-8,1,2,0
I ordered this for my parents (older) so they can play music/YouTube videos from their iPad. I showed them how to use it (very simple to operate) and it will work perfectly for them in that sense. The size and the sound quality is good to.My biggest problem with this Bluetooth speaker is that it’s pure solid black (including all the buttons). The black buttons are very difficult to see because they blend in with the color of the device. You can’t see them unless you hold this device at a particular angle and under a bright light. What genius at the manufacture thought of this design? Stupid design. A younger person must have thought of it.,1,1,2018-10-10,1,1,0
"I've had this speaker for about a year and a half, and in the beginning, it worked perfectly.  However, about 6 months ago, I noticed the Bluetooth stopped working, and it won't wirelessly pair with my ipod anymore.  But it's possible that's more the fault of my ipod (it's kind of old), and I can still use the AUX plug, so no harm no foul, I guess.  However, even when I pair it with my iphone, it sometimes doesn't work or requires me to fiddle with it in order to get to work.  Also, I had the speaker playing yesterday after having charged it overnight, and it kept cutting off for some reason.  Maybe it didn't charge sufficiently (I'm not sure why that would be the case), so I will try again today to use it, and hopefully the problem doesn't repeat itself.  Overall, I have enjoyed having it, the sound quality is pretty good (at least in my opinion), and I would buy it again even knowing that it might only work perfectly for about a year or so.Update: Speaker no longer holds a charge no matter how long you plug it in for. I was hoping this would last me longer than it actually did. Going to try a different brand next time.",5,1,2017-5-29,1,3,0
"The sound quality is great. Syncing one speaker to the other is cool and works (sort of). But these Bluetooth speakers do not stay connected to a laptop for an extended period of time. I bought them to use for workshops I lead that involve video and to play music for participants during their work time. I can get one speaker to connect consistently and found syncing the second speaker to the first worked well at first, but then became problematic the more I used both speakers. If connected and not used for more than 10-15 minutes, they disconnect completely or play audio in bursts interspaced with silence. I can't have tech that fails to perform in trainings I lead. It looks and sounds unprofessional. I wanted two speakers I could spread out in a room that would sync. Instead, I got tech I couldn't trust.I've got an older Braven speaker that costs more than these two speakers combined, but it also works flawlessly. I had to return the speakers and will most likely fork out the money to buy a better quality speaker that puts out more sound.",1,1,2019-6-25,1,1,0
"I have had an issue (up until now) of being able to hear the TV while in the kitchen.  In order to hear it, I needed to turn it WAAAYYYYY up, but then it's too loud for people sitting in front of the TV.  Connecting one Oontz speaker with a cord (not supplied) to the back of the TV eliminates lipsynch issues and then pairing a second speaker to the first one allows me to place it in the kitchen.  Problem solved!  The included directions made this a very easy process!  There are A LOT of wireless, bluetooth speakers out there that are garbage.  These Oontz speakers ARE NOT one of those!  Amazing flexibility and sound!",5,1,2019-2-12,1,9,0
"I bought this in July, and was initially very pleased with the sound, either cabled or bluetooth, the portability, and toughness/waterproof characteristics.  So, after a few months, scratch the ""toughness"" aspect, because like others have noted, and with SO many other products out there, the USB port is mechanically flimsy and after repeated use fatigues and fails.  Why Cambridge Soundworks, like so many other manufacturers, insist on employing USB when all it's used for is power, is beyond me.  Great sound and battery life for the price, but if it's only going to last 3 months I would expect Cambridge Soundworks to take some heat for the number of these things that will be littering the landfills in short order.EDIT:  From 1 Star, to 3.  Based entirely on the response and support from Cambridge Soundworks. (see the comments to this review).  Cambridge Soundworks acted quickly to this issue, and offered a replacement unit.  I received it less than a week ago.  3-Stars from 1 is a good bump.  But the replacement unit has the same somewhat flimsy USB port for charging the unit, so I'm withholding a better rating until I see how this one holds up.  I also asked about disposal of the original but haven't rec'd. an answer to that question; if these thing are basically disposable that would be horrific, since I'm pretty sure that whatever these are made of has no business being in a landfill or the oceans.",1,1,2018-10-19,1,2,1
"WOW!!! I love this speaker. I was looking for a small Bluetooth speaker to place on my headboard to pair with my older flatscreen TV. It is a Sony and has pretty good built in speakers but it is across the room and when at volume to hear in the bed, the audio can be clearly heard in the hall and adjoining room when the doors are open. I wanted a more immersive sound experience while watching TV in bed and boy did I get it. The sound that comes from this small, unobtrusive speaker knocks my expectations out of the park. There is an incredible depth and balance of tones. I love the clarity especially when I turn the volume down at night as I sleep with the TV on. This speaker is plugged in and used essentially 24 hours a day. I did test the speaker at a volume comfortable when listening approximately 2 foot away to see what kind of battery life it had and it was over 24 hours. The manual states that at higher volume there is shorter battery life. This speaker can fill the 120 sq/ft room easily at higher volumes. We thought that we would I initially want to pair another and have one on each side of the bed but it is totally unnecessary. One of the features I enjoy the best is the that the volume buttons are a raised  “+” and “-“ symbol that allows for ease of volume control in the dark. I have not used this speaker with a phone or ipad so I cannot speak to the features that allow the speaker to be used to answer calls or to play and search through music from a portable device so I cannot speak to its performance of these tasks. I had had previous experience with Cambridge Soundworks products and I believe you cannot go wrong with their products. I did have to use an optical output to Bluetooth adapter on my TV since it was not Bluetooth enabled. I was a little concerned that it might be too technical for me but the instructions were clear and the speaker immediately paired with no problem. The wireless adapter that I used was Taotronics model TT-BA09. This adapter does come with a male to male optical audio cable. It was not clear whether it was included.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"I had certain expectations when I made this purchase - it has a lot of good reviews. When I received the package I was a bit disappointed, as it was a tiny shipping box.... with an even smaller product box inside. Immediately my expectation was that the sound quality was going to suffer because the speaker is so small.Wow I was pleasantly surprised! While it does not have the quality of my comparably sized Bose Soundlink Mini.... it is also more than $100 less expensive and a quarter the weight of the Bose. The sound is really good, and indeed you can identify some low-end bass within the music. Obviously if you're playing techno, or if the song has  some really low-end beats, you're not going to get the same effect as you would with a subwoofer.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,1,0
"I got this little Bluetooth speaker to listen to my podcasts at audio books when I’m home cooking, cleaning, working, etc. when I don’t feel like wearing a Bluetooth ear piece (I wear it all day at work, don’t want it on my head more while home) and my iPhone isn’t quite loud enough at home while I walk around doing things. It’s about the size I expected based on the customer photos (which is an awesome thing amazon allows). It’s small but has a solid quality feel. It doesn’t feel like a plastic cheap kids toy.It connected very very quickly to my phone and reconnects to it quickly as well, which is a big deal. I switch between a lot of Bluetooth devices (two Bluetooth ear pieces, one Bluetooth headphones, my cars blue tooth) so it’s a big plus for me. Some devices get fussy and you have to go into settings and totally reconnect. Just turn it on an it’s good to go.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"I was given one of these as a gift a little over 3 years ago and inadvertently tortured it. I work on cars and motorcycles as a hobby and all of that work is done outside and not in a shop and my speaker was always there with me. There were a few times when a sudden rain would pop up and it's been forgotten outside a time or two. Often my Oontz Angle 3 would get stored with the rest of my tools in the locked storage shed. Other times it went with me on the job to act as a speaker phone for clients. No matter what the circumstances it always delivered until it finally gave out. After that amazing performance what's a guy to do? Simple answer is order another one just like it. They charge quickly, hold a charge well, have a great sound without annoying the neighbors too terribly much and durability for the price is absolutely amazing.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0
"3rd Generation review.  Works great.  I used with my laptop.  The difference is striking when playing a video or music on my lap top.  I connect the speakers and the sound is fully acceptable.  Works great with my tablet also.  I can play audio and simply move the speakers about with me from room to room or outside into the yard.A fine portable ""personal"" speaker.  I have never had it run out of charge when using.  The only issue is the on off button is small and with my fingers I need to kind or dig my finger into the button to turn on or off.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,2,0
"I've used this to listen to music and podcasts in the bathroom for two years. I have also stuffed it into my suitcase for trips when I don't have any other means of listening to tunes. It's mostly good, and has held up well despite being dropped in the shower many times. The only noticeable effect of this is the front grille is loose fitting.The Bluetooth no longer automatically connects. I have to pair it every time I use it. I once had trouble connecting it to a previous phone, and powered it on holding down the pair button. Perhaps this put it into a permanent ""pair every time"" mode.",4,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"I like this speaker.  I bought it because it was cheaper than similar speakers.  It's a good looking portable speaker and it doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself.  I think I generally get 8-10 hours of play time from it, depending on how loud I have it set.  This is enough playback time for me.  It feels light and well built. Connecting via bluetooth is easy and simple.  The reason it receives three stars is sound quality.  It can be a little muddled at mid-volume.  I'm not looking for perfection from a small, cheap speaker but my old Bem speaker did a better job at moderate volume.  Granted, this is all based on personal preference so it might sound fine to you.",3,1,2019-9-9,1,2,0
"This is the second Oontz speaker I have purchased, and I really wish I had known about the dual-pair option when I bought my first speaker as I would have definitely gone with this one over that one so I could have two of the same kind and taken advantage of that feature. The battery life is significantly shorter than my other Oontz Plus speaker, but this one is smaller and still produces the same clear sound. The bass isn't great, but I didn't expect it to be with this small and cheap of a speaker. It is completely waterproof, I have used it in the shower almost every day since I purchased it, and it is easily the best feature! I cannot recommend these speakers enough, they are such a great value for the money!edit (09/05/19): still love the speaker, still works great in the shower and out. However I bought a second one to try out the dual pair option and it's not that great. When playing music from both it sounds great, but if you want to play any videos, there is a lag on the audio, and to prevent this you have to plug the speaker into your phone/computer. This is not great for what is supposed to be a bluetooth speaker. Deducted 1 star for this.",4,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
The problem with most reviews are they're written when the items are new. After a few years this speaker battery is dead with only a hour of use. Was satisfied up until now. Maybe for some a few years is enough but being from the old school I don't throw things out as soon as a new model comes out.,1,1,2019-7-12,1,4,0
"I really like this speaker... it has amazing sound, I had to go thru the different equalizer settings on my phone but DAMN it sounds impressive. A few other speakers I have tried the same equalizer experiment, they didn't hold up and the base had a bad wonky pang like reverb, not this speaker it's like you're there. I was going to say ""for the size of this speaker"" but forget the size it truly is impressive for any size speaker. I use VLC for my music and my equalizer setting for big sound is ""Large Hall"" (it sounds slightly muffled when your volume is low but when go loud everything is proportioned just right) or ""Soft Rock"" for lower volumes but still a little big sound. Will definitely buy from again but next time I want to get their two speakers that pair to one device for stereo.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,1,0
"At the last moment before a trip, my portable Logitech speaker broke, and I needed a new one before the trip. I did not want to spend much, and I found the Oontz Angle 3 speaker, it was cheap so I figured it was a throwaway speak that would last a couple of days and then break.This speak is fantastic, the sound quality is excellent, and the battery life last about 5-6 hours while blaring music. The sound quality is good, the battery life is good, and it was easy to pair with my android phone.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,1,0
"Old review updated:  I really hate slamming a product I initially loved, but I have tried everything, and my speaker I loved so much just quit working after two months.  I have tried to post an update once before, but I must not have completed it, because no one has contacted me, and I cannot believe I am expected to keep a product I bought on Amazon as a prime member when it did not even last 6 months.  The trouble is that, even fully charged, when I turn the speaker on, it comes on for a minute, then dies.  I have done all I can do, and so now I am back to using my trusty IHome bluetooth speaker (which I bought at Radio Shack two years ago and still works like a champ.  It does not sound as good as the Oontz Speaker, but I do not have to replace it 6 times per year.  Amazon or Cambridge SoundWorks should reach out to me now.  I will keep you all posted.I have purchased several of these little Blue-tooth speakers to carry with me on picnics, place around the house for music while I am cleaning, and to carry outside for cook outs or poker night.  I bought the best one from Radio Shack for $39, and that tennis ball sized I-Home speaker was the best until Oontz.  I got the sweet red Oontz speaker a couple of weeks ago, and this evening-bag sized speaker beats all five of its predecessors in sound AND price.  My husband and I listened to some of the glorious love songs of Whitney Houston Sat night over Rhapsody connected via Bluetooth to the Oontz.  We never got up to full volume, but it sounded like that angel was singing in our den, with a choir surrounding us.  Sunday we used it to watch a movie on my tablet.  When the bad guys were surrounded I could hear the bullets whizzing past my ears. That is a STEREO.  I plan to order a couple more in a few weeks.  Once again, Amazon Prime came through with a fine product at an excellent price and two day shipping was free, as always.  Thank you, Cambridge SoundWorks for giving us Boze Quality at a price we all can pay!",2,1,2016-1-6,1,9,0
"When I first went to make a review, I was kinda irate because the speaker didn't appear to be recognized by my Echo Dot. The pamphlet included with the speaker is woefully out of date with how to connect a bluetooth speaker to Echo Dot. That said, eventually I figured it out. The speaker's sound fidelity is about average and what you would expect for a ~$25 traveling bluetooth speaker. It decently fills up my living room or home gym with decent enough quality audio -- and it's battery life is pretty good.",4,1,2019-4-1,1,3,0
At only $22 it's overall pretty decent.. despite a few small grievances ..until ultimate death🥀☠️... It's small but loud & fits easily on a window ledge or other spot to prop nearby... cuz there's unfortunately no 🚫device to hang. I initially bought a couple Oontz fitted cases sold separately & returned all as they were to simply zip close n carry.. useless for my needs..Connectivity🔗: 😀pretty easy & quick.. however if you need to momentarily disconnect..

"I've had this little guy for almost a year now.  It's pretty awesome! The bass is surprisingly strong for the size.  Sound quality is great.  I use this with my phone Bluetooth,  turn up full volume on my phone and that speaker is crazy loud,  I don't need to put the full volume on the speaker.  Super clear.  we originally ordered 3 different speakers to test out. This was way superior and cheaper and smaller... didn't expect that. Returned the others.  Almost a year later it's still going strong. Btw, We use this mostly in our bathroom/ shower, even louder cuz of the acoustics.  Definitely no problems with water,  I mean we don't submerge it but it does get a bit wet,  still works. The battery life from one charge is super super good 👍  We rarely have to charge it it seems. When we do,  doesn't take long.  I've charged it using my laptop and the wall.  same.  I'm genuinely impressed with this little speaker 🔊 👌 . We have had to use it for the house when our power went out one night... also sounded great! I think the shape helps amplify the sound,  it did for our house.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"*UPDATE May 3rd, 2019*The speaker just died.  As written below, after I switched to the Samsung s7 phone it was a struggle to get the bluetooth to connect.  That never did get any better.  Today, it no longer comes on.  No lights, no sounds, completely dead.",1,1,2019-2-24,1,2,0
"I bought this because I didn't want to replace the stereo in my 2003 car.  It's old enough that it has a 1 CD player and... a tape deck!  I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks in my car and my phone's speakers aren't loud enough to cut it.  This speaker does the trick.  The sound is really clear and is loud enough that I can listen even when I have studded snow tires on, which make my car a lot louder.  I haven't listened to any music with this yet, so I can't comment on that.I might get some Command velcro stuff to stick it to the dash, but for now, it just lives in the passenger seat.  It's also small enough to fit in my already crowded glove box.  My car has an inverter, so I can charge it right in the car, which is a nice perk.",5,1,2019-3-9,1,1,0
I REALLY wanted to like this speaker but the fact that I constantly have to re-establish the Bluetooth connection with my iPhone is a deal-breaker. It might play 1 or 2 songs but then the connection breaks and I have to stop what I am doing and reset it. I mean even when I leave my phone RIGHT next to it this happens.Unfortunately I can't return it as the return period just expired. I guess I should have tested it more and discovered this flaw earlier.,1,1,2019-2-10,1,3,0
"I ordered one of these a few years ago and I liked it so much I got another one for my wife. Sound quality was excellent, battery life was very good, charging was no problem.Bluetooth pairing could be pretty tricky, though.

I’m glad I waited to do a review on this speaker. I bought it in February and I barely used it. In may I started using it Monday-Friday for work. Today it completely went out on me for no reason. I never dropped it or anything. When it did work it was a pretty good speaker for the price. The buttons were pretty janky. I mean you get what you pay for but yea I got a good 3 months of light use out of it. Thank me later,1,1,2018-5-28,1,7,1
"I literally spent a few months trying to figure out the best Bluetooth speaker option for myself. I have a few Bluetooth speaker in the house that I had bought quite a while ago that actually work well, but I wanted something a tiny bit more powerful so that I could practice guitar along with it and use an amplifier and not have it sound thin or compressed or weird or whatever. The other Bluetooth speakers that I have I basically use them at the bedside streaming some ambient noises just for sleeping at night, so they're not particularly powerhouses or meant the blow my mind with epic sound.Just came quick, and was actually charged when I got to me, which was very cool. Connecting it to my phone was effortless, and every time I connected it takes mere seconds and is not a big ordeal. Extremely user-friendly, the controls on the side are easy to find even if in total darkness probably. In one of the pictures you can see the controls easily laid out, and under the power button there is a little flap that allows you to connect an external speaker with 1/8 inch cable as well as a port to power the speaker up with a USB cable that is supplied. The item is small, but has some girth to it. It's extremely well-built , and I don't have any worries about the quality or durability at all.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,1
"The alternator recently died in my Saturn Vue and took the factory standard stereo with it (which was already a bit wonky). I tried changing the fuses and my mechanic made sure it wasn't something he unintentionally caused and could correct when he was taking care of the alternator, all to no avail. And after the alternator, an A/C repair a couple of months ago, and work done on the fuel system a couple of months prior to that I'm not exactly in a place to replace the stereo, so I've been trying to get by the last couple of weeks with just my headset or one of the other Bluetooth speakers we have, including our beloved VicTsing. Unfortunately, the volume just could not compete with road noise intrusion and the bass was blown out and static-y.  That and I prefer to have my caterwauling masked by loud music and bass, so it's been a sad couple of weeks of commuting unless I stuck to podcasts and even then I couldn't really hear lower register sounds over the road noise.This little gem arrived yesterday and I was immediately blown away by just how loud it could get in a 10x15 room, let alone a vehicle cabin! The sound is clear and the bass is deep and not distorted, even at top volume. It has super grippy little feet on the bottom that kept it solidly on my dashboard for my entire commute, even going around corners and making turns! And while it's not exactly the same as having the surround of multiple speakers, front and back, it totally works as I need it to.  The sound fills the cabin and for the most part, it's akin to having my stereo back in working order. Thank you to Oontz for providing an inexpensive solution!",5,1,2018-8-17,1,2,0
"This speaker arrived on the first day of April in 2018. Product died in early March 2019. The company was willing to send me a replacement for the cost of shipping. I was miffed that this thing only has a year-long lifespan, because it seems wasteful that it becomes trash within a year. When I think about it, though, a $24 speaker that lasts a year is only $2/month.

And the battery would last nearly the entire day, even at full volume!But... after only about a week, it started to have issues charging. I thought it was the thin charging cable it came with, or perhaps the little converter that plugs into the wall, but it was actually the charging port on the speaker itself.

"I usually only listen to music in my car, but I wanted something so I could listen to podcasts & stuff when I’m cooking & doing housework, cuz sometimes my iPhone just isn’t loud enough. I’ve read some negative reviews on here about the sound quality. I don’t understand why people expect Bose or JBL quality in this price range. That being said, I think the sound is clear, the range is full & wide & the bass thumps pretty good. It may distort a tiny bit at full volume, but it’s barely noticeable. The unit is sturdy, compact & attractive. It’s got a little weight to it, so you know it’s not total garbage. For just being able to listen to music or podcasts while doing housework or enjoying tunes while sitting on your deck or around a campfire, this unit is perfect. Synced up to my phone via blue tooth immediately & I was actually pleasantly surprised at the volume & fullness when I played some music. I guess you do get what you pay for, but for this price I think I got exactly what I was looking for. The fact that it’s Bluetooth and Also has a Jack For using a cord on mine Bluetooth devices is a nice option. Charges very easily. Charged it, but don’t know how long it will hold. I’d recommend it if you just want something portable to use when doing house chores, camping or whatever where you don’t need the absolute “best” sound quality. I think it sounds good!

Got my speaker two days ago and was easy to set up with my Alexa via bluetooth.  I fully charged the speaker and was impressed by the big sound coming out of such a small speaker so was very happy at first.  This morning went to use the speaker again and it was already dead so I plugged it in again.  It started to work but the sound was kind of in and out like it wasn't getting a good bluetooth connection even though it was less than 5 feet from the Alexa Dot.  Tried it again this evening and the sound was just a bunch of screeching and static so apparently this thing is already broken.  And to make matters worse my dog chewed up the box it came in so I can't even send it back...ughh.  My suggestion is to pay a little bit more and find something reliable.,1,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0

I would be ok with that as it seems to have good connection range, it can be used with the power cord plugged in (VERY short USB cable 2 feet), connected easily, power and volume buttons clear, set-up to work either standing or laying down... a lot of things to like.I did try to search prior to purchasing it but I didn't realize that when you pair it with the Echo dot the Echo mutes itself; so it's one or the other and NOT both (fault of Echo not the speaker). I simply wanted to extend the sound of what I was playing on the Echo dot. I didn't need another Echo dot (smart speaker).

Audio kept cutting out although the speaker was fully charged and followed the trouble shooting procedures. Attempted to reach customer service several times and they never got back to me.  Apparently they don’t really have a customer service department although they pretend to have one.  I am returning the speaker.,1,1,2019-7-12,1,6,0
"Charging this thing is annoying. The light stays red the entire time you're charging and it gives no indication that it is done charging. I can leave it on the charger for a full day and the light will just stay pulsing red. So I never know when it is actually done charging, or how long it actually takes to fully charge because there is not indicator.Battery life is pretty poor for a bluetooth speaker. This thing is a little over a year old and it gets around 8 hours of play before the battery dies.. It also doesn't give a warning that the battery is getting low, it just dies. By comparison, my cheap $20 anker BT headphones get nearly the same battery life. Also, my old Photive Hyrda speaker that I had for 3 years maintained it's battery life very well and would consistently get 18 hours of battery life even though it was rated to only get up to 8 hours.",3,1,2018-10-3,1,2,0
"My trusty little CA speaker (non Bluetooth) had just died after 11 years of faithful service, so I was on the hunt for a replacement.  I searched Amazon extensively and decided on the OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) because of the price and reviews.  Had I continued searching within the OontZ line of products, I would have purchased the slightly more expensive (and a bit larger) model with the ability to switch tracks from the speaker and the extended battery life.  But, I bought the OontZ Angle 3.  My first impression when it arrived was that it was way smaller than expected, but that's a good thing.  I use the unit with a 3mm headphone jack cable attached to my iPod, so I'm already way lower tech than the folks who will use this as a Bluetooth speaker.  I use this speaker on my motorcycle rides - not on the bike itself, but in the tent or motel when I land.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The bass could be a little deeper, but overall it sounds great and gets loud.  My minor complaint(s) with the unit are as follows:  1) it's all black  (by the way this comes in several colors, which I didn't realize when I ordered)  Because it's all black, the controls are hard to see  2) the little rubbery flap that lifts up (near the on/off button)  which contains the charging port and headphone jack - looks like it will tear off if not handled VERY carefully.  I play mine standing on end in order to get the most bass quality, otherwise the bass speaker is facing downward and the sound is somewhat muffled.  If I had it to do over, I would buy the larger OontZ Angle and buy it in a color other than black.  Otherwise, I love the speaker.",4,1,2019-7-20,1,1,0
"Simply the best. I’ve owned DOSS, JBL, Anker, Cambridge, Jambox you name it.  I always find myself reaching for my Oontz (I’ve owned 4 models currently have 3 gave first one away. 8 years old still sounds impeccable with very minor glitches with BT connectivity.)  they ate just the most compact and lightweight and sounds freaking incredible. Crisp yet has a deep rich bass. Buy it! Trust me. Best bang for your buck, no doubt. If it doesn’t workout, you can always return it for free with Prime**photo is of my 2 new ones. Oontz Angle Solo is the Smaller one and is for traveling and boyyyy is it  L O U D  for a singular speaker and bass is surprisingly richer than the Angle 3, the one next to it which is the medium sized one with double speakers?..oh well I’l take it!)",5,1,2018-11-14,1,3,1
I use this as my main speaker system on my laptop. And I do not Bluetooth it. I directly connected with 3.55 Jack and have it powered at all times. I love the sound and the ability to just pick it up and walk off if I need to do it but I have not needed to do it yet. The downside the only condo which again takes it to four stars is the there's no way for it to instantly come on when powered up in a plugged in mode. This adds a step to the power of process it seems a useless step if it's already plugged in.Pros: Bluetooth,4,1,2019-10-22,1,1,0
"Well I wanted the Bose Sound Link Mini II, but I missed out on Prime Day. This is definitely not on par with a tank like the mini, but for $30, it's impressive. I wanted a small Bluetooth speaker for my laptop, this speaker fills the void that the tinny Acer laptop speakers miss. Its sound is almost as good as the echo.I've found for better bass, lay it flat, the passive radiators definitely help. We're talking basic features here, but for myself it sounds darn good for $30. As far as longevity goes, I'm on the fence, a 90 day warranty isn't the best and since a lot of reviewers pointed out, they ended up with a paper weight. Also take into consideration that close to 20,000 units have beens sold, so it's fair to say you'll end up with a few bad ones, which is why I opted to spend the three bucks for the additional warranty.",4,1,2017-7-21,1,3,0
"I'm very pleased with this little speaker. We had the original oontz for several years and the charging port finally broke. It was no surprise considering how rough we were with it, tossing it in the floor of the truck, taking it to job sites and leaving it outside.This speaker is much smaller than the original. I was a bit skeptical because of that but it seems to be even louder with great clarity. I live on just over an acre and it can be heard from all points on my property. My neighbors can hear it too lol",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"This little speaker is great! We use it every day. I purchased it to use for my daughter's birthday party coming up soon, but we have used it a lot already. The volume goes really loud so I don't think we'll have any problem with it at the party. The sound quality is very good in my opinion. It sounds clear & crisp. We've used it at bedtime & hanging out outside. The only complaint I will say, is you can't go too far away from the speaker if you have it connected to your phone (& carrying it with you) otherwise the connection goes in & out. Battery life seems good. I haven't timed it to see if it matches with what it says. But it seems to last long enough for typical use.*EDIT*",5,1,2019-4-24,1,1,0
"There is nothing good about this product. My device was a foot away from the speaker, and the bluetooth connection created so much feedback and static, that it distorted every song.

"First off, it's well-packaged -- cleverly boxed, secure enough for shipping, but not difficult to open. Second and perhaps even more surprising, the instruction pamphlet (a) exists on paper, (b) is written in English by someone who's obviously fluent in English, (c) makes sense from beginning to end, and (d) isn't really even needed, as the set-up is mostly intuitive. I'm a little flabbergasted how easy it was to set up this device. From signing for the delivery to singing along with the rock'n'roll took about ten minutes.Most important, though, is the sound, and I had my doubts. I work 13-hour shifts and wanted to hear my tunes in a *loud* workplace, before and after my 9-5 colleagues go home. But my desk is only about 15 feet from the roaring HVAC unit that makes luxuries like *thinking* and conversation with coworkers difficult.",5,1,2019-8-31,1,1,0
This is the best speaker I've ever owned.  I use two of them on my boat.  This is the only speaker I know of that will allow me to play music via bluetooth through both speakers at the same time.  I put one in front of the boat and the other in the rear.  Fantastic!  I usually stay out on the boat 3-4 hours and the batteries have never failed me.  When I get back home to charge them it only takes 10-15 minutes to get a full charge.  They are waterproof and I've dropped one a couple of times and have had no problems.

"I have an Anker speaker that I use to listen to my audiobooks in the car to and from work and sometimes at my office. I don't like using headphones or earbuds. The Anker is a good speaker but it's heavy and after a couple years I was tired of carrying it i my purse or work bag to and from my car/house so I sought a smaller speaker. This OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) is about 2/3 the size and a little lighter. I wouldn't want to carry it around in my purse either but I leave it at my office so that I can leave the Anker in my car and just take it into the house now and then. I could have gotten a second Anker but wanted to try another brand and I'm quite happy with the sound of the OontZ. I also like that the sound seems to be fuller, not to just come out of the front of it though it does come from the front of it.I prefer the controls on the Anker which are on the top of the speaker. It's easier to see the buttons. The controls on the OontZ are on the end so I can't see them. I could stand the speak on end I guess but I prefer it sitting lengthwise. Just my preference. Anyhow, I control the audio from my iPhone which I don't mind at the office since I have it sitting in a stand within reach. That would not be handy for my car while driving but I use the Anker in the car anyhow. It sits behind my steering wheel where I can easily reach it if needed.",5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"I just love how small it is and yet, the delivery is ON POINT! Now, if you're a musician or in the broadcasting industry, that may not be it for you but if, like me, you just needed a DECENT speaker that is portable, VERY efficient AND with really good sound, don't look further - this is IT!!! And for that price, too? I am thinking of getting a second one (once I get another job, that is) because transporting it from my home PC which is almost always in the bedroom and serves to watch Netflix, to my office station has been a bit rough on it and at times, you need to reconnect it because I guess it gets confused being between two PCs? I cannot recommend this product enough! So worth the money! Like I said, I'll definitely be getting a second one when it'll be in my budget but I'm a HIGHLY satisfied customer and...I just WISH AND PRAY that they keep this quality they have going on because sadly, most of the time, when something gets popular the quality pays the price (""get money quick"" type of mentality sets in and in the process, all the praises they got get lost but I do wish them success but hope they won't sacrifice quality for the 'bottom-line'?

"Many years ago, I would receive the Cambridge SoundWorks catalog at my house. We're talking back in the 90s when I was a teenager. It's a name I've always respected but the bad side to that is I have higher expectations on them. This bluetooth speaker has been a very versatile option for us but it's not because of its sound.We have two Bose Mini-Soundlink IIs but as good as they sound, they have a charging base they have to sit on while charging. That's not too frustrating but I kept thinking if I had one that was more movable and versatile, I would be able to leave the Bose where I like them and that's in my office and in the bedroom.

"**PLEASE SEE TWO UPDATESWell, what's not to like about this little, powerful, tuff son-of a-gun speaker??? I waited a long time to review this little dynamo and I just get more and more impressed with this wee guy!!! I live in the country and carry this speaker everywhere with Alexa pouring out tune after tune. Probably drives my neighbors (multiple acres away) with the extreme quality these little speakers (there are two) pour out!! I have dropped it more times than I can count, my dog has run off with it and shook it (all the while playing George Strait at top volume), then thankfully brought it back. Stuck in the window when it's raining, it never gives up-cat has swatted it around and I even take it into a humid post-shower bathroom. Alright, I never intended to abuse it, but it's my only music speaker, but not sadly, this little thing rocks! The battery stays charged for days if you turn it off at night and even if you don't and it dies-just plug it into the charger and it play immediately-and charges at the same time. I have plugged it into my laptop for MP3 tunes....phenomenal. I keep thinking, I should get another one, but this little thing plays so well, I have to turn it down just to realize someone has come over to visit!",2,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0

A few months later, same thing.  I went through the ""hard reset"" steps listed on the manual and got it to connect, but no audio (I could use the Play/ Pause button on the speaker, but that was all).In general, I think I got what I paid for: a cheap, low-quality speaker that sounds pretty good when it feels like working.",1,1,2019-4-11,1,4,0

The USB-C charging port on my LG cell phone works and has worked for 2+ years now, so I know there is a solution to this problem out there!!! Too bad, because the sound was GREAT with this speaker.

"Update 3 months post purchase. Now I cannot seem to keep a charge on the speaker. I'll leave it on the usb charger for several hours and it will only charge half way. I also recently took it on a road trip and it played approximately 3 hours with no problem before dying. Since dying I attempted to charge it and the sound wouldn't transfer on via Bluetooth or aux cord. Sucky thing is that it's more than 3 months beyond the warranty so I can't return it.I've had it for the past two months and think it's a great product. I've used it in the shower or generally around the house. The sounds is very loud and bright. You can monitor the sound both with the dials or through the source of the sound (e.g. phone or computer). I've used it both with my phone and with my laptop, and it does great at amplifying the sounds when I'm streaming a movie. The charge stays forever.

I was relatively happy with this out the box. It held the charge ok (only used in the car to/from work) & charged ok at first. Then after charging it would play maybe 15 minutes. Would plug in to charge again & it wouldn’t charge at all. I hadn’t even had it 60 days!! I contacted Amazon chat & after time chatting back & forth they said I would have to ship it back & the warranty may or may not cover it.

"I own the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra and ordered this very quickly thinking it was the same model because I needed one when I was away, but when it came it was very obviously the younger sibling of the one I have. I needed the speaker for a kids' birthday party being held in a ~500-600 sq. ft. room with high ceilings and when I unpacked this model, I was disappointed because it wasn't the same model and I was afraid the music wouldn't be loud enough for the entire room to be able to hear.To my surprise, this little guy is actually very loud! My first test was setting it up in one corner of the room and going to the opposite corner to see if I could hear it, and even when it wasn't at max volume, I could hear the music very clearly. I ultimately set it up in the middle of the room close to the ceiling so the music could project downward and have equal radius of sound distribution and it worked out perfectly. I never even had to have the speaker cranked to full volume.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

So now the Solo is plugged into the TV and I'm using this wack, tinny speaker for my computer because I don't need it to be too loud right in front of me. I just returned a sound bar that wasn't loud enough to get this one. I'm just going to keep it because I'm tired of having to return stuff.

Music quality is fantastic, have not had any issues connecting to my phone (Motorola Droid), so far the battery has lasted longer than the 8 hours recommended. I have not gotten it wet so can't really comment on that, but I have used it a few times in the bathroom while showering and there was no issue there. Definitely recommend and would buy again!

"I ordered this so I could play music and podcasts at work. We had a radio that corroded beyond repair so I decided to look for a Bluetooth speaker so we couldn't need an aux cord. I wasn't looking to spend much since the radio we had corroded terribly (Antenna fell off, right speaker rusted, aux port became non-functional and the buttons would perform random functions) so at $20 this caught my interest. The issue was it was my first Bluetooth speaker and I didn't want to buy something so bad it was a waste of money even if it was cheap. This thing sounds great though, the lab is pretty small so we haven't gotten to max volume, the bass is so much better than listening off the phone itself or that radio we replaced. It's pretty small so it's easy to take with me to the car in my coat pocket so it hopefully lasts longer. The bass isn't close to something you'd get with a sub-woofer and I doubt anyone expects it to but that does mean lower range of songs won't sound as good as they do on a stereo. I can't speak to the range as I leave my phone in the lab next to it, I also can't speak for the battery life as it hasn't died yet. Since it uses the same charger my phone does I just plug it into the speaker till my phone battery is around 50% then I swap over the the phone. It does last me the 8+ hour workday and probably would easily do that on battery alone, though I have no reason to try. At $20 even if it does fail because of exposure to whatever is floating around the lab at the time, as long as it lasts a year or so I can't be mad at it.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I bought this phone conferences with friends and family, where my smart phone (turned up loud so we can all hear) has poor, scratchy sound.  This speaker has nice tonal range and clarity....so much so, my wife has adopted this one to listen to music when gardeing.  ...so I have ordered another for myself.

I know that doesn't seem terribly long but I swear in this day and age where they cheep out on materials so things won't last, It  is nice to find something as rugged (Has been dropped far and thrown pretty good, surrounded in  dust...) and great quality as it actually claims.

I have a feeling well be getting a lot of use out of it. We've had other speakers before but they end up collecting dust because they were cheap and the sound quality was the same as a smart phone.

The thing is, it shakes and vibrates like it's really working hard, so I even went so far as to open it up to verify that the speakers hadn't been wired out of phase, but nope they were wired correctly.

"After one year, battery life is still good, I go through a few uses before draining the thing (I’m always listening to podcasts if I’m cooking or cleaning, and even off to the side as background noise if I’m playing a video game), it’s hard to judge how many hours but I’d guess 8 to 10. I use it around the house and find it decently loud. I haven’t used it outside. Right now it’s connected to my laptop (MacBook Pro 2011 via Bluetooth) and I’m watching Iron Man 3 and the sound is fantastic. It’s better than the sound on my tv, for sure. At $25 id buy this over and over again. The only con is the port you plug the mini usb into to charge it feels like it would be easy to jam into the unit if you don’t take the extra few seconds to gently insert the cable. But after a year it hasn’t happened, but I don’t force it either. And like I said before, only improvement would be to upgrade one level to double up and get stereo sound out of 2 of these (I believe the angle 3 ultra does this). Love this speaker.Do not listen to the negative reviews, that is either user error or a fluke. Now, I will admit I just got this, and immediately upon seeing its size and weight I thought it was going to be cheap crap.

It arrived two days later, and I've been loving it ever since. Even apart from their willingness to replace my product, the customer service is outstanding.",5,0,2015-10-10,1,2,0
"Speaker worked fine for the first three days, but now when using Amazon Music the songs cut in and out over and over again!  Song will play for 10-30 seconds, then 10-30 seconds of silence, then the pattern goes on and on.  Radio stations, TuneIn, and Pandora work just fine and Amazon Music works with no issues when just playing through my Echo Dot (when Oontz speaker is turned off).  Very frustrating to say the least!  I went to the Oontz Troubleshooting page,  but this issue was not addressed.  I've just emailed Oontz Customer Service--and if I don't receive a prompt, successful solution to this problem I will be returning the Oontz Angle 3 to Amazon for a full refund.",1,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"I was a little hesitant to buy this, considering the price is so low and I've never heard of the company. But I'm glad I pulled the trigger. This is an awesome little speaker. I work in a noisy kitchen with dishwashers running and pots/pans hitting steel tables, but this thing is loud enough to be audible from anywhere in the room. The sound quality is excellent. The range on the bluetooth lets me keep my phone in my pocket and walk pretty much anywhere in the building without it disconnecting. Our staff uses it collectively and it's been compatible with everybody's smartphones. Charges pretty quickly and has a good battery life, even at high volumes. I wouldn't purposely submerge it, but it's been fairly water resistant too.",5,1,2019-8-28,1,1,0
"Bought my first one of these speakers two and a half years ago, to use with a Raspberry Pi 3B.  I recently added a new Pi 3B+ system to my stable, and have just ordered one of these speakers to go with that Pi, as well.For their size, I like the bass these speakers deliver, and I appreciate that there's is a bit of heft to the devices.  They stay put and don't dance around on a desk vibrating.  The volume is impressive, and without distortion.",5,1,2019-3-26,1,1,0
"Very likeable design, textures and construction materials but programmatically poorly thought out and incomplete.I bought it to use with Alexa via Bluetooth and analog connection to my kitchen PC. It worked out for neither. On the PC end, there's no way to control the volume of the device from the computer (unlike every $10 computer speaker ever made), and worse, you must manually turn the device on EVERY time you use it.",3,1,2019-1-20,1,1,0
"I bought this little speaker for some workout music. We moved out exercise equipment to another room, about 30 feet away. I believe the product description for this speak says there is a 100 foot range. Well, when I walk away from my computer (where the music program is playing) and turn a corner, the sound breaks up and goes out before I'm 8 feet away. There is 1 wall between the speaker and my computer. So, that means I have to use my phone and keep it nearby.Sound quality: one can't expect much sound quality from such a small speaker, but my expectations were still too high. It's not terrible, but it's not curiously good either. It has room for improvement.",3,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
Bought first one in October '17 & really loved it so bought another in November (for a gift)and yet another  in Feb 2018.  Unfortunately we never unboxed the one that we bought in February of 2018 until three days ago which is March 25th 2019. It has been in the original packaging on the file cabinet in the spare bedroom. Not exposed to any kind of heat or moisture.This one is identical to the first one that we bought except that it makes a high-pitched staticky buzzing noise anytime it is paired with any device or even if it is plugged in via the jack & all bluetooth on all devices are off. Cannot get the buzzing to go away. Have tried everything:,5,1,2017-10-27,1,2,0
"This is my second Oontz Angle 3 and though it was sold as a 3rd generation device, the motherboard is clearly marked “ V 0.2”, so I am unsure what I have. I give this a one star rating as it is my second Angle 3 from Amazon and the second to develop charging issues literally two weeks after the wambly 90 day warranty ended. The first one just stopped working and would not accept a charge...no lights, nothing. This time, the unit charges but the red power/charge light will not go off and the unit runs until it discharges fully in a couple of days. I followed the reset procedure with no improvement (first unit did not respond as it will not take a charge). The device has good sound and easily connects to Apple and Android Bluetooth devices. Unfortunately, don’t expect this unit to outlast quarantine as it is unlikely to do so. Oontz Customer service has yet to respond to my email, but it sounds like these units are prone to charge port failure, which is my guess here.",1,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"This speaker was purchased over others because there was an Amazon recommendation next to it.  It just does not really sound good.  I have tried it in multiple settings, such as in the car, on office desk, hooked up to Amazon Dot in the kitchen.  It is OK for music and terrible for spoken word.  For music it boosts the sound volume of my other devices and adds base.  The trouble is the mid range of the speaker.  If you listen to any talk radio or books, do not buy this speaker.  It makes the voice of the speaker sound like he is singing/speaking on the chipmunks album.  I have never heard anything like it.  I tried downloading some equalizer apps, but that did not work either.  It is actually very bad to listen to this speaker and now I guess I will have to gift it to someone or just let it sit collecting dust, because I cannot stand to listen to it.  I am now also jaded to Amazon's choice or Amazon's pick or whatever they call it.  It is obviously just a brazen sales ploy instead of an actual recommendation like consumer reports or other rating sites.  I suspect from my experience with this speaker that they just recommended it to get rid of the stock.  I waffled between two stars 'I don't like it' and one star 'I hate it'.  I hate it.  One star.I have to make an addendum to this review. Since I was not able to figure out how to return this item, I have used it subsequently in a very limited fashion. The chipmunk sound that I described has not recurred, so I suspect and Internet or provider error. The sound quality is not great, but this is a very small speaker.  I am not thrilled with the sound but I’m also not extremely unhappy with the device as I was previously. Rating has been changed from one star to three stars",3,1,2017-12-8,1,1,0
UPDATE: the volume control stopped being consistently functional the day after I wrote my original review! Not so useful anymore...I bought it with what I thought were reasonable and practical expectations - the Oontz Angle exceeded all of it.,2,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
Holy crap this speaker is loud. I really underestimated this device. My hubby has a JBL flip and I wanted one just as good. My bestie has this speaker and like the way it sounded so I bought it for myself. Well it came today and I must say I am truly impressed. It's just as good as the JBL flip. My hubby even said so. He is a stickler for sounds. I know it's great if it passed his hearing. I haven't had it long so I'll definitely update once I've put it to good use. As of right now I'm in love with it!!!🤗🤗🤗😎😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤯,5,1,2019-7-12,1,2,0
"Quit working in a very short time. Worked good for a couple times, while showing to a few friends. Never used for a extended period. Then tried to turn on one day , nothing,blue charging life would not even illuminate. This is my second electronic device from china, and they both quit after a short period. I believe devices are engineered to burn out in a short period. Most electronic devices in my experience last forever. American made always used to last forever!!!.

"My laptop speakers are not the best and that really messes up the netflix quality which we all know is a vital component to a happy life. So I purchased the Oontz angle in hopes that this bluetooth speaker could hook up to my laptop and allow me to actually hear what Michael Scott was saying rather than guess. This speaker works amazing. It's so so so nice to be able to hear every thing, the quality sound is so high it amazes me it's coming from this little portable speaker. I highly recommend this product. It won't let you down.",5,1,2017-11-26,1,4,0
"I first purchased a OontZ Angle Portable Bluetooth Speaker in 2016 and it was a great product.  I've tried several different bluetooth speakers and was very happy with it in comparison to others - Anker, Soundverse, Aukey.  For the price - the sound quality was better than most, the price point was great, it worked well for 2 years and considering the price was worth it.  It did die from overheated connection when charging, luckily I noticed the spark.  The second one I purchased in 2018 lasted less than a year but after return policy.  It wouldn't charge/play/connect.  I then tried Aukey and Anker.  Anker was the worst, the smaller version did not work at all and couldn't return in time.  The more expensive Anker Soudcloud Flare stopped working in less than a year, couldn't return either.  The smaller Aukey also stopped working within months and had terrible audio, of course after return time.  So now I'm on my third OontZ Angle Portable Bluetooth Speaker and not pleased as it connects OK to Linux laptop but cannot keep connection to Chromebook.  and frankly, tired of receiving substandard products, will not be purchasing OontZ Angle products again.",2,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0

"I bought the speaker last June as I just started shopping online. I noticed a problem as I charged the speaker - the connection between the cord and the speaker was very loose, basically it cannot stay connected, I had to use something (e.g. a pillow or a book)  to hold it to stabilize it to charge it. As showed on the picture, the cord cannot stay straight, it tilts down.Since I wasn't an experience online shopper at the time, I just decided to continue using it that way. Until this Thursday, it cannot be turnned on completely.",2,1,2017-8-12,1,3,1
"I started out by charging the unit for 8 hours (just to be safe). Solid light indicated full battery. Held down power. Nothing worked. Plugged it back in, and it worked WHILE plugged-in/charging, but the moment I unplugged it, everything turned off. Repeated the process with no change. It would only function while plugged in. Furthermore, when it actually DID play music (while I had it charging), the quality was pretty bad, and only emitting from 1 out of the 3 sides (so weird to not make a triangle omni-directional). I was so frustrated that I literally threw the product in the garbage. This was less than 24 hours after unboxing it. The price I paid was not worth the effort of the return process. The old adage prevails: You get what you pay for.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"We are outside a lot and have been sharing a single Bluetooth speaker. They don’t make the one we have anymore so I chose this one based on reviews and it has outstanding clarity, sound quality, plays louder without sacrificing quality and am just overall pleased with the purchase. Just turned it on, looked for Bluetooth devices and wah-lah it was linked and playing. Only drawback for us is it would be nice if it had a wrist strap. We hang our older one from tree branches, the farm quad, etc while we work. Yes you can set this down, would just be nice if it had a clip or strap attachment.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,1,0
"Sounds great, battery last for many hours, and it can play while it is charging. There are days where I start playing music when I wake up in the morning and I don't need to start charging it until dinner time or later. I've used it outside while working in the yard and the sound projects a surprising distance considering the size of this thing, and with no distortion! To reiterate that last point, this thing can get LOUD, especially indoors. No problems with the Bluetooth pairing, very simple to manage. Bass is directed downwards and seems to reflect off of whatever it is sitting on, so you will get better sound when placed on a hard surface. When on a hard surface, the bass sounds quite good for the price of this thing. You definitely lose out on some audio quality when this is on soft surface like a couch/bed or in your hand, it is very noticeable when you place it on a proper surface. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality Bluetooth speaker at a very reasonable price.",5,1,2018-10-4,1,1,0
"When running the system via bluetooth - no real issues.  Somewhat easy to connect and sound if fine.  Not a real ""thumper"" when it comes to bass but it does the job.I purchased this as an external speaker for a small TV set.  The TV set speakers are very tinny and I wanted to upgrade the sound, this fit the bill.  Small, direct-connect, inexpensive.  First think I noticed when I plugged in a cable was an audible hum.  The hum exists at all volume levels and it doesn't change with the volume of the speaker - it is just loud.  I thought it was due to a bad cable.  I tried another cable - same thing.  It was loud enough that it was competing with voice on the TV to the point that the TV volume has to be loud to drown out the hum (loud being 4 on the 1-10 volume scale).  Not acceptable.  I verified that the cables were good with other devices as well.",2,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"Wasn't expecting too much for the price point here but it definitely exceeded. The angle is pretty en-genius. I like to point my smaller bluetooth speakers toward the wall or any flat surface because the sound seems to bounce back louder. I normally have to place something under the front of a speaker to give it an upward angle to maximize the affect. This speaker already has the angle so this works particularly well. Most speakers I have bought in the past that have good bass seems to come at the cost of a decent midrange sound. This speaker has plenty have bass and seems balanced with treble and mid as well. Which is great if you ever listen to anything other than rap. Doesnt get distorted at max volume either. I really liked the doss touch wirless v4.0 bluetooth speaker and got on to purchase another but after seeing the reviews on this one decided to give it a try. They are extremely close in sound quality but have to give the win to the OontZ angle because is smaller, so easier to travel with. It also seems a little bit less distorted at max volume than the doss. (the doss may have a tiny bit more bass but not much at all) Overall a great design and great sound at an unbeatable price.",5,1,2019-7-12,1,1,0
"I got the Oontz Angle 3 for my old, non-Bluetooth laptop (with a separate cable) and what a surprise! It was much better than anything I was looking for or thought was available. It works equally well for my Ipod and Android phone via Bluetooth and I appreciate the built in microphone. Distance is great with plenty of battery life and easy storage and placement given its triangular shape and efficient size. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quick upgrade to music and movies via a laptop or computer.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0
"I've purchased 8 Angle 3s of different varieties. Some as gifts, I've kept 4 for myself. I purchased 1 in January simply because it was on sale and I was impressed with how they sound, plus I'm a gadget junkie. I haven't needed to use it because I have 3 others that work just fine. I finally broke out the new 1 and to my disappointment it does not keep a Bluetooth connection. I have a Samsung S9, S9 plus, S10, and a Pixel 3A, and it won't stay connected to any of them. They all drop in less than a minute. It works fine thru aux input so it's not the battery. I figured, it's been a few months but well within a year for a warranty replacement, but they only warranty their items for 90 days. They obviously don't stand behind their product. I gifted a Tribit speaker, 11 months in it stopped working, no questions asked replacement from them. Anker includes 18 months warranty on the speakers they sell. Purely my fault for bypassing the little Accordion leaflets they include with your purchase, nevertheless, 90 days is enough to lose a very repeat customer.",1,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0

But I have tried it now on 2 different PC's (one CyberPower, one an Acer Chromebook) and it drops signal quite often. Have a cheapy speaker that never drops signal. I expected it to stay connected until I turned it off. As it stands, I have to reconnect at least 4-5 times an hour whilst watching vids. Update: I have to reconnect every 30 seconds or so.

"This is my second Oontz Angle 3. The first one lasted about 2 1/2 years before the little rubber flap covering the switch and other connection broke off. The problem with this is the flap has a protrusion that touched the power button. Once the flap broke off the power button was very difficult to reach and I had to use a chop stick to get into the small opening to reach the button. That being said, I abused my first one big time and it lasted like a champ. I used  it at my desk as my laptop speaker and I always had music playing. I would take it to the garage when I was working on my boat. It vibrated off the shelf a few times and hit the floor hard and kept on ticking. I also took it on my boat in the hot humid Florida weather where it got sprayed, rained on, and left out in the dew in the morning - kept on ticking. I took it camping where I would play guitar along with Youtube videos - more than once fellow campers dropped by to ask me to please stop playing guitar, but wanted to know what that great sounding speaker was (LoL).I just connected my new speaker and it connected instantly to all of my devices. The first one was really tricky connecting most of the time (""Forget This Device"" and all of that). This one sound equally great. Time to take it to the lake and see how it does with a bit of H2O.

"I’ve had this Bluetooth speaker for 2 years and I think it’s near the end of its life. The speaker is really small, hence the low price. But it still packs a punch for its stature. Higher quality and more expensive speakers are better than this one, but the point is that this is not a bad choice if you can’t justify the cost of an expensive Bluetooth speaker. After two years of daily use, I have started to notice that I have to charge the speaker more often and the connectivity gets sketchy if I so much as walk in between my phone and the speaker, or position the speaker further than the average length of a living room (I used to get a bigger range). Also, I’ve definitely dropped this speaker a few times and no damage was done. If you want a good speaker but don’t have the money for a high end one, this is a good choice. If you really want that premium sound quality in a high end Bluetooth speaker, save your money and wait until you can get it.",4,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0

"This is a very nice little speaker. I bought it because I've been a fan of Cambridge Soundworks for a LONG time, this particular unit was on sale, top in its class, I had some points to redeem, and I love my other Oontz speaker (Angle Solo). This unit's bass is underwhelming and would be disappointing for music, but it's perfect for my purposes.The reason this is great for me is I am a few months away from releasing my Chirpsounds transmitter, which lets users stream sounds from their birdfeeders to a Bluetooth unit inside, right through the windows. If you live in a place where it's really cold and gray for days or weeks at a time in the Winter, hearing the birds on the 4th or 5th crappy day in a row is like Spring arriving early. But I digress. The reason this is so good for my use is because my transmitter is sensitive enough to pick up faint bird sounds (even seeds cracking), but that also means it can pick up traffic at rush hour. Almost all of the traffic noise is below 500Hz, so dropping some the low frequencies reduces these unwanted sounds.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

It's also the perfect size to fit in my pocket and go with me when I'm driving. The battery life seems awesome. You won't blow away your neighbors with the speakers, but it's a perfect personal Bluetooth speaker. Also, it charges back up quickly. I listen to a lot of Western Classical and Afro-Pop, so I really appreciate the midrange on the speaker. The design is super-ergonomic, the only thing it lacks is the ability to play a memory stick. But for the price, it's GREAT.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,1,0
"I am SOOO happy with this speaker system.  It is perfect for ANYONE, ANYWHERE.  I bought this to use with my portable cd player and MP3 player, and it produces INCREDIBLE sound for such a small unit.  Very cool looking and convenient to use. (I did not use it for Bluetooth application.)  Too many reviews are complaints that it is just not BIG enough.  Understand that this is a small unit, for use with smaller musical appliances.  It does NOT produce the sound of a BOOMBOX, and is not meant to.  It gives good, quality sound which is meant to enhance smaller musical units like MP3s or small CD players, etc.  It is not going to give you an auditorium-like experience from these small speakers.  It has small speakers, not for an auditorium, but a room or two, and it is GREAT at doing just that.  HIGHLY recommend from my experience.  I would definitely buy again.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"This speaker has adequate sound for listening to audiobooks, etc. but doesn't come close to music sound quality I get from my Google home device which was disappointing. Battery life is also adequate, as is Bluetooth connectivity.My biggest disappointment is the fact that even though I seldom unplug it to take it elsewhere the USB port has become extremely loose & positional. I bought brand new cables, thinking it would fix the problem, but every one of them wiggles in the port. Even with it just sitting on the shelf the cable gets disconnected randomly, causing it to turn off a few minutes later if it's paused. Currently I'm using it with the cord taped to the speaker to try & keep it charging... it's too annoying to deal with much longer so I'm looking elsewhere.",1,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0

This is small and compact so I can use it in my car or when working from my laptop to listen to podcasts and music. Its perfect. It pairs effortlessly with my phone. It's small and light to carry around. The indicators work as you would expect. At this price point this is almost perfect. The only critique is I wish I could have bought 2 to pair together to get a stereo effect with music. I bought this for my car (which has no bluetooth) and I bought two Aomais Sport II for my home office. I love the OontZ better than the Aomais for ease of use and pairing. I have had trouble pairing with the Aomais and though I like the sound prompts of the latter,, it is really annoying to hear ""charging"" repeatedly when I'm trying to use it while charging! Why would they design a prompt like that? So OontZ gets my vote hands down. And I must add I am not a techie by any means so these purchases were a leap of faith but I already am so grateful for the pricepoints that made me willing to try them--they are enabling me to listen to podcasts and music wherever I am in my home.",5,1,2018-4-4,1,1,0

I put this bad boy in the bottom of my tub filled with water for over 12 hours. Well it didn't work after so I bought another and tried 8 hours. That one also broke so I bought a third and tried 6 hours. Same thing so dropped it to 4. This time it held up and worked after so I tried 5 and it died. Drew the line below 5 above 4.

I am skeptical of any claims of high quality audio from basically any Bluetooth speaker but I needed one and came across this one and gave it a shot. While it lacks the power and obviously size to reproduce high fidelity audio it does a surprisingly good job considering the odds stacked against it. Definitely one of the best Bluetooth speakers in this price point which is pretty reasonable. Is it a couple hundred dollar Bose or something along those lines? No but for the price its a dang good little speaker.Update 8/24/19,5,1,2018-12-15,1,1,0

I mainly listen to jazz/rock fusion and progressive rock (among the various fashions of music), and the work that these musicians place on recording is performed with detail and intricacy, and for the listener to appreciate the effort achieved in the works, far more is required from the system than one dinky little micro-speaker can produce.",5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"I am hesitant to rate this five stars, only because I have only had it for around two weeks. That being said, I am very pleased thus far. I purchased this to replace a EWA-A106 speaker, which I initially liked but which failed within a couple of months.  That one seemed fine for a few weeks, but became problematic soon after--failure to fully charge, unreliable bluetooth connection, et al. (Other reviewers have noted this also.) The OontZ is a lot more reliable. And sound quality is a significantly better. Of course, it costs more, but being designed by Cambridge SoundWorks, I have a lot moe confidence. Finding an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker to purchase is not easy. Should you buy a Bose or Sony that costs a lot more? Maybe. I was willing to try my luck a second time, based on Cambridge SoundWorks' reputation. I hope this helps.",4,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"This speaker worked fine for the first month or so, but now its making the mucis sound weird, like its a record skipping, or it will sound like its slowed down.

"I ordered this and everything was perfect.I used it on top of the showcase when we had mini parties and when I cooked. Great sound and battery. Recently. I tried using it around Christmas and the sound was terrible, like mono. So I figured it was the batteries because it was very low. I fully charged it, and tried again twice, but the battery does not charge very well and even when the battery is charged, it doesn't last. The worst part, the speaker sound is officially busted. It sounds like something from the intercom system back during the war times as seen in movies. The only time I brought it down from the showcase is to charge the batteries, which I would say is no more than a handful because battery did last really well on one charge, and I use it like once a week or every other week for maybe half hour at most. Now it doesn't even charge well and the charge doesn't hold past half hour. Very disappointing because I really liked this while it lasted. I bought this in the summer so it lasted me about 6 months before the speaker busted. Two stars because I did love it before it died.",5,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0
I love the sound quality and portability. Also buttons are really easy to press. They are clicky. Press once on power and it turns on right away. It takes more than 5 seconds to connect which is kind of long. Press two seconds on power and it turns off. Connection doesn’t cut off when I walk around the house and that’s very important to me. That means I don’t have to carry my phone around. I wish I could control my phones audio through speaker though. Phone and speaker have both independent controls. Over all I really like it. It is well worth the money.,5,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0
This is a seriously awesome speaker! We live in florida and spend 90% of our weekends at the beach or by the pool. We had one of those old speakers where you have to plug your phone in and I was getting sick of not being able to use my phone when at the beach/pool because it was plugged in. This was the perfect solution! Not only can I use my phone no because it's bluetooth. BUT it's waterproof and sand proof. No more crackly speakers this one has super clear audio and can get really loud too! Can you tell I'm not a tech nerd :) I don't know much about technology but for me this was such an awesome solution. Also really love how quick my phone can connect to it. Took like 15 seconds for me to figure out how to connect it! Because it's waterproof we can leave it on our patio all the time too. We obviously have super high humidity and torrential downpours all the time so I don't have to worry about this. When we're ready to party all i have to do is turn it on and put the play list on! Plus you seriously can't beat the cost!,5,1,2016-7-23,1,4,0

"I'm so blown away by this little device and how powerful it is. Trust me, this device is a great buy for the price of $26. It has AUX connectivity to go with the Bluetooth capability and has a nice hidden compartment that can be lifted to reveal the AUX and the USB outlets. The design is another impressive part of this speaker. It has a rubbery finish around the edges that will reduce the shock damage of a fall. There are also buttons on the speaker to control the vol up and down and to pause whatever is being played. Long pressing will skip to the next or previous track. Lastly, the base of the speaker is fitted with rubber stands that will ensure that it stays in place where ever u put it. All around the speaker is a good buy. its durable, with powerful sound and easy Bluetooth or AUX connectivity. I highly recommended it.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,1

"Have only had this speaker one day so I don't have a lot of run time with it.  Here's what I've discovered.  I've tried it with my MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone and HP Spectre. The Bluetooth function pairs quickly with all of my devices.  I also have a Bose SoundLink and the OontZ connects even quicker.  The problem I have is when using it with my MacBook connected to an external monitor.  Then the Bluetooth not only sounds awful with a lot of static, it also interferes with the signal and cuts out the video.  However, if I use the 3.5mm audio cable, it works just fine. The reason I bought this is that MacBooks cut out the sound when using an external monitor.  So you need a speaker like this.  I'm OK with the cable,  just would have preferred using the Bluetooth.It appears to be well constructed.  Haven't run down the battery yet to see how long a charge will last.  It's very easy to set up.  I like it's small size - doesn't take up much space on my desk.  The sound quality is very good for a small speaker - not as good as the Bose, but certainly adequate.  And for the price, it's a pretty good deal.",4,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"I've had this speaker for almost two years, so why am I reviewing it now? Because it is a BEAST.We had a wiener roast last October, where I used this to play music from the edge of the porch. Since we haven't had any outdoor parties since then, I forgot that I'd left it out there. I came across it today. That's right. This thing survived SEVEN MONTHS outside—including a harsh Ohio winter. It doesn't look great now, but I just charged it up, and it works perfectly! So impressed.",5,1,2019-4-11,1,2,0
"I really wasn't expecting anything fantastic out of this for sound quality, I just needed something that was better than my built in phone speakers for listening to music outside.

I didn't want something that would make the neighbors windows shake plus it saves a ton of battery life on my phone since the built-in speakers aren't doing the heavy lifting.  As for battery life of the speaker I've outside for several hours and not had any trouble.

"I've owned four of these speakers and love their output and sound quality. My issue is the weakness/ flaw of the charging port. I would give it a zero if possible at this point. Three of the components I've owned have major issues with the ability to hold the cable in place while charging. It's like the receptive end (in the speaker) is too loose to keep the cord plugged in. It will wriggle free so easily and/or just not even light up red when plugged in and if it does, it will not stay put to charge. One was so loose I just returned it straight away.

"Updating my review after owning the unit for almost 3 years: Overall it has served me well for the last 3 years. When I first got it, I was actually very impressed with how long I could go in between charges. I might only  have charged it once every month. But to be fair I was only using it for about ~5 minutes a week. I use it mainly as part of my work as a private music teacher to for example play a song that I am working on with a student. The main negative for me was that carrying it in my backpack constantly caused it to turn on by itself! The on button is too sensitive in my opinion. My backpack would be in my car trunk, and randomly it will just turn on (it makes a sound when it turns on). This happens literally almost every time I am transporting it in my back pack. I think it auto-shuts off after a few minutes of being idle, but that's still a few minutes of unnecessary battery drain when it turns itself on in my car trunk. But unfortunately, after 3 years the battery will no longer hold a charge, (so it's effectively useless now) which is the main reason for this review update. I don't know if that is normal for all BT speakers of this type or not, but I thought it was something you all should know!",3,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"While my out-of-pocket was substantially lower than the asking price (I only spent $10, thanks to an instant coupon and a prepaid Visa rebate from an unrelated purchase), the Angle 3 is still merely an OK speaker.Sound is veerrrrry mid-range-y, and surprisingly even pales compared to the entry-level--and single-speakered!--Sony SRS-XB01 (I primarily used the XB01 for comparison, as it's the closest competitor I own) and is absolutely blown away by the JBL Flip 3/4 speakers. Now, the asking price for the Angle 3 is about 1/3 to 1/4 of the JBLs, but is only a few bucks more than the Sony. And while sacrificing solid bass and scooped mids, what those few dollars exactly gets you is twofold: Volume and battery life. The Oontz has a great battery (a dozen or more hours, vs the XB01's 5-6hrs)! And it's quite a bit louder to boot.",4,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0

I bought my second one of these for a gift! The 1st one was for my son-in-law who is an electrician and loves his! He has been using his for 3 yrs now on his job sites. The 2nd one was for my very hard of hearing friend who has trouble hearing the speakers on her old iPad mini. I was thrilled at how easy these are to link to a device and stays linked! The sound is terrific and both love that if it starts to rain you don't have to rush to grab it because it's water resistant. This is very important for my son-in-law since he wires new houses and they are still under construction. He can get his tools put away 1st before worrying about his speaker. These are very well made and the sound quality is really great at a price that can't be beat! I would not hesitate to buy another one of these!,5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"**UPDATED 8/11/20**  Just for yucks I tried the pairing process with my Echo Dot again and this time it worked without a problem.  Don't ask me why, I didn't do anything different!  I was able to connect and play Amazon Music over the speaker and take it out by the pool.  The sound and range was impressive for something this size and price.  I changed the rating to 5 stars as this speaker exceeded my expectations.I bought this speaker so I could pair it with my Echo Dot 2nd Gen and have music out by the pool.  I have to say, the sound is surprising for such a small speaker.  Unfortunately, none of my Echo Dots would pick the device up when scanning for a bluetooth device to pair with.  In contrast, both my iPhone and iPad picked it up and paired with it immediately, so what I did was download the Amazon Music app to my iPad and paired it there.  Works like a champ with the iPad - great sound and great volume.  That's what persuaded me to keep it rather than return it, but it won't work for the original purpose I bought it for.  If you are looking to pair this with an Echo device, look elsewhere.  Otherwise it's a great little speaker for the money.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I bought this on a whim because I needed a wireless speaker but I didn't want to spend a lot of money and this speaker really exceeded my expectations. The battery lasts quite a long time especially if you're not at full blast. The sound quality itself all the way up from low to high is really good. It isn't the loudest speaker in the world, I tried to hear it over my snowmobile and it wasn't happening but I wasn't expecting to be able to either. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's annoying to tell whether or not it is on or off making Bluetooth connection a hair frustrating. Sometimes it makes a on noise sometimes it doesn't. But other than that it is a great little speaker for in the woods, working on a car, or at work. Oh and I was able to hear it pretty well at a large skate park but there were only a handful of people there making noise.

"I wanted this to play audio from my Alexa Echo dot and it does. It was a little tricky connecting it the first time but after that as long as you pair it with the Alexa command and then start playing the audio it works good.  I paired it with my phone too but tried to raise the volume with the plus key and it skipped to the next song.  I don't like that the power button is invisible and hard to find.  I don't like that you can't tell how much charge it has left.  I wish it had like 5 dots that lit up and went down for every 20% of power left.The sound is very good, even loud it's not distorted.  I like to hear news channels from Tune in when I'm in the shower and my bathroom has a fan that turns on when I turn the light on and I can barely hear my tablet when that happens, but with this I can hear it even when the fan and shower is running.  It's also good that it's splash proof in case I drip on it while I'm toweling off.  I also like that you can turn it off and then Alexa disconnects and I can hear the audio in my living room thru the echo dot.",4,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"This angle 3 pretty much lives up to the description. The sound quality is excellent, the battery is great, and I like the style. Unfortunately, they put the audio-in port right next to the power port. This means if you're using your unit in analog audio mode AND you're charging, you get significant output noise, even when no audio is playing. It's a real bummer. To make the line noise go away, either don't charge the unit, or use only bluetooth.Speaking of bluetooth, this unit does not play well with non-premium brand bluetooth. Yes, it's great for iPhone. But, for Android and PCs with bluetooth, audio quality may stutter, and connectivity may suddenly fail.",3,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"OK, I bought this item quite a while ago (over a year ago), but I figured I'd leave a quick review of it now. Overall, for the money, this is an excellent little speaker. I use it in a very limited fashion. Basically, it's my bathroom (specifically SHOWER) speaker: I take this speaker into the shower with me, and set it on the ledge (it doesn't get wet from the shower there, but it's exposed to lots of humidity, and my wet hands), and use it to listen to NPR in the mornings. That's it. And for this purpose, it's great. Meets my needs perfectly. I chose this speaker because it has great clarity on vocals, and doesn't have TOO MUCH bass, like some speakers from the more major manufacturers. For example, I also have the JBL Charge 3, but it has WAY too much bass for this purpose. I also had the JBL Clip 2, which had the same problem. The Oontz Angle 3, despite its claims of ""Rich Bass"", I find to be more well-balanced, and I specifically bought it BECAUSE it doesn't have too much bass. It's very durable (mine has met with the floor several times, and is still going strong, even a year later), is waterproof, and has great sound for my specific needs. And it's incredibly affordable! I would buy another one if I needed it, but I don't. Not yet, anyway. So, I actually can't offer an opinion of how this speaker performs with music. But for talk radio & podcasts, I found it to be excellent, and great value for money.",4,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0

"I've had mine for 3+ years, and I love it still. Solid, clean sound for the size, with a fair treatment of the bass frequencies. Yes, it is stereo, but the two speakers are right next to each other, so it is functionally a mono speaker. It is also directional, so the sound quality and volume depend on which way the speaker is facing. I can get about 20 feet away with my phone before the Bluetooth connection starts to cut out. I usually just leave my phone next to the speaker. Battery has never run out for me, and I use it several hours several times before I charge it. The rubber cover over the USB port is a little difficult to peel up, especially for a guy with short fingernails. There's also a headphone jack under there, but I don't see the point; you could just connect your headphones directly to your phone instead.

"I bought this speaker almost a year and a half ago to take with me on photoshoots. It had good reviews and was small enough to easily transport in my camera pack. Since then, I have used it more at the house I purchased back in April. I’ve been even more impressed with it since using it there. This speaker gets pretty bumpin’. The house we bought is on 5 acres but there were a few times I felt the need to tell my other half to turn it down so we don’t piss off the new neighbors. For a while I thought it could only get that loud because we didn’t have carpet. But I didn’t really notice much of a difference in how loud it could get after we put carpet in either. I also don’t notice much of difference in sound quality with the volume changes. It’s one of the easiest things I’ve ever connected to Bluetooth. I rarely take the time to write reviews so the fact that I’m writing this almost a year and a half later should say something. Overall I couldn’t be happier with this purchase!",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
The battery life on this speaker is amazing! I listened to music all night and it hadn't even been fully charged when I turned it on and the next time I went to use it the battery life was still at 30%. My last speaker only last 1-2 hours. When I first turn it on and connect it tells me what the percentage of battery is left which is nice. Since I've gotten it in April I've only charged it twice but I don't use it regularly. The Bluetooth connectivity is also great. I have a habit of taking my phone and leaving the room and I can pretty much go anywhere in my house with it and the speaker is still playing clearly in whatever room it is in. I definitely don't have that on any of the other ones I have. My only issue with this is the sound quality isn't that spectacular.

"I needed a speaker to connect to an old projector through Aux input for outdoor movie nights that we have for the kids and their friends. I originally got the echo dot, but it wasn’t loud enough outside. I took a chance on this, and when it arrived, I hooked it up through the AUX input, and it was quieter than the echo dot. I thought I was going to send it back, but then decided to try pairing the speaker through Bluetooth directly to the FireTV that I had plugged into the projector. The sound was very clear and LOUD. We used the speaker outside in the yard to play a movie, and everyone could hear it, and the sound quality was shockingly great for such a small speaker. I’m not sure why there is such a sound difference between the AUX and Bluetooth, but i was having that issue with every speaker I had tried. If you are buying this for the AUX input, expect about the same quality as an echo dot. If you are using it for Bluetooth, it’s much louder than an echo dot.

The buttons and connections have been relocated to the upper corner on the back.I generally use this with audio cable because the charge on my nano lasts longer than when using bluetooth.

You control sound by using the volume control on the device you have it connected to.  lt does have a forward  and a back button l assume is for use with playlists on the phone, ect that you're connected to but l have not used that feature yet, as well as a pause feature. There is also an on/off button. There is a blue light bluetooth indicator and a red low battery indicator light which flashes when low.  As I've stated I love the simplicity & good sound of this speaker and highly recommend it for that use. I plan to purchase two more while they are in stock to leave in the bathroom and kitchen for convenience rather than carry one from room to room. I feel the price is great for this quality product and that allows me to purchase multiple units.  Definitely recommend this product .",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"This little speaker really impressed me. Most Bluetooth audio devices tend to suffer from the effects of compression and music usually doesn't have a rich, full sound to it. This speaker was the exception. Whether listening indoors or outdoors the fidelity of music reproduction was more than just adequate, it's actually good. Don't get me wrong, you'll never confuse this speaker for a proper set of loudspeakers. But for spending $25 on something that fits in the palm of my hand, I was blown away. It will play loud enough to fill a medium sized room (~400 sq. ft.) or outdoor space by the pool.Proximity matters, of course, and if you are more than 10 feet away the sound will understandably be thinner and less pleasing. This little speaker definitely punches above it's weight and I view it as nothing short of brilliant!",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"I bought the first one, was super happy with it until one day after about 6 months of use suddenly didn't work. I tried everything, including contacting the manufacturer. They said they have no idea what happened since this has not happened before, they have no record of anything like this. I said I would ship it back so they can fix it, the response I got was it was cheaper for me to get a new one with just a $5.00 shipping fee. So I agreed, after being reassured this won't happen again. I got a brand new one promptly and was very happy with the speaker... and the same thing happened again!After 6 months of use, just dead one day... completely dead. Now I don't believe the manufacturer didn't know this happens. Too much of a coincidence for this to happen twice!",1,1,2018-8-11,1,1,0
"Sound quality is ok at best. Almost no bass at all. Sound is flooded by mids and highs. The only thing this speaker has going for it is it plays clear at loud volume levels. Battery was never great. It would last 4 to 6 hours at best. After 1 month of use, battery appears to no longer hold a charge forcing me to leave it plugged in. After 3 months, it began to loose bluetooth connectivity and speaker would just power off making me have to get up and turn speaker back on and reconnect. Disclaimer: this was put thru heavy use. It was used as a night speaker playing music for 8 hours every night.",1,1,2019-6-6,1,1,0
"I have had several of these small BT speakers.  Some are simply trash, others are better.  My expectations for such a small package are not very high.  This one has changed my view!I like the design.  The triangular shape gets the speakers aimed up away from the surface it is sitting on.  The corners are protected and the it has soft feet to keep it where you place it.",5,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"I bought one to test it out - threw it in the pool and it kept right on going.  Our primary use is to take it down by the dock on our lake to have music down there so we arent blasting out the neighbors by cranking the outdoor speakers up. I wanted something with a good sound - and this speaker does the trick.The description indicates  you can connect multiple speakers - so thats my next plan.  Im hopeful that the 2 speaker setup will be just as easy to do.  Going to wait to see if another speaker comes for fathers day, and if not, happy fathers day to me - i'll buy it myself.  :P",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"This is a great little speaker.  Sound quality and volume is better than I would have expected from so small a device, but I still consider it a personal speaker.  Putting it on speakerphone at a table with about 5 people definitely strained its capability.  Spreading out anymore and we would have had trouble hearing the conversation and being heard on the mic.  Using it in the bathroom is excellent however.  I have generally used it in the shower several times a week for the last 2 years.  Plenty loud enough, with headroom to spare.  It has survived plenty of splashing and wet hands.  And, battery life is great.The only annoyance is when I play audiobooks.  Oftentimes the reader will pause between paragraphs or sentences.  If the pause is long enough, the speaker appears to ""sleep"" to save battery.  Waking back up takes less than a second, but is long enough that it will often miss the first word of sentences or paragraphs.  Some books are much worse than others (depending on the reader).",5,1,2018-4-26,1,1,0
Typical cheap product.  First ones work & get great reviews.  Later ones like mine don't.Misses on ALL connection and power issues.  After I had it a while then it only works if connected directly by mini plug not on blue tooth.  May turn off at any time for no reason.,1,1,2018-8-8,1,0,0
"This sounded fine when we first tried it in Late January 2020, but when I tried it today, (Aug 20) it sounds like it's underwater. We've only used it in the house 3-4 times for short periods.  I bought it to use in the car with an iPad so we could hear better over road noise when we travel, but with covid19 we didn't travel like we expected to the speakers sat unused for most of March -today.  It should still be working well even if we had used it a lot. It's past the return date so I guess we're out the money.  My friends had one that they used quite often in the last year and theirs hasn't had a poor sound so maybe we got a lemon.  I will have to look for a better quality from another company.",1,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"The sound quality is very good, when it's not dropping out. I keep the device right next to my desktop pc so it's not a distance issue, but I have had to unpair and repair the speakers almost every day since I received it on August 1st, often when I switch to a full screen game while the browser is running. Every so on, there's a buzzing noise or voices will become garbled. This usually happens when I switch videos or go from browser to full screen game. I like the speakers tonal range. The quality of hi low in midtones is fantastic for music, especially in stereo, but I am leary of the issues I've seen so far. Perhaps over time this will resolve itself... but we'll see. I will say, I have another blue tooth speaker that I don't have this problem with, which I replaced with the Oontz Angle 3 because the Oontz has multiple speakers.",3,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"It was becoming quite tedious to unplug and plug my speakers every time I wanted to listen to music in another room. Therefore, I wanted a wireless speaker that I could easily grab around the house, for when Im taking a shower, cooking, working, etc.This speaker does the job. However, the sound quality is nothing to boast about, its basically louder and slightly better than my cellphone (I have an iphone5), which is not great for a speaker. Anytime I play anything with something of a bass, or high note/pitch, these speakers do not play it super well and there is slight distortion.",3,1,2018-5-16,1,2,0
I have an older model that I bought years ago and still works great though it is showing it’s age. The only problems I’ve ever had are: 1. where the charger connects has gotten loose and can be tough to charge and 2. After leaving it outside in the rain a few times while it still works perfectly fine the sound quality has gone down a little.So now to review the actual product that I should be reviewing... I LOVE IT!!!,5,1,2020-3-10,1,1,0
The sound quality is decent... I mostly just listen to the news and audio podcasts. When I have listened to music it’s OK but it doesn’t get very loud. If you want to rock out  I strongly suggest that you  keep looking for another speaker! The volume is but it doesn’t get very loud. The Bluetooth connectivity is a problem. It recognizes my phone as long as I am standing right next to it when I turn it on but if I’m trying to do it from the other room it does not work. If I go into the other room so that there is a single wall between  my phone and the speaker it often will disconnect.  When I’m going around the house I will often just pick up the speaker and put it in my big coat pocket so that I can keep listening to my program without it disconnecting. It’s good for the very basics!,3,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"Originally I rated this speaker with a one star rating and my thoughts about its quality .... a volume issue. A day or two later I received a very nice email from a Customer Service Representative stating that my comments were noticed and the company wanted to provide a few hints as to what my issue might be.  I reviewed the list and experimented with their suggestions.  Immediately the volume was where I expected it to be.  My issue was ""Operator Error"".  Today I would rate this speaker as a 5-Star item.  I believe the quality of the speaker and the company should actually be rated higher.  If you are looking for a good looking, powerful speaker that is worth far more than the selling price .... THIS IS IT.I highly recommend this speaker.",5,1,2018-1-10,1,2,0
"Before I start, don't read this review if you expect a glowing recommendation, you won't.So I had reasonably high expectations for this device since it was by Cambridge Works, a brand I had familiarity with many years ago for their quality of materials, reliability and good sound.

I've had this speaker for about 6 months and it stopped working well. It keeps shutting off a few seconds after i connect it and won't connect to my phone. The sound isn't as loud as I had hoped for and started becoming quieter over time. Even if I charged it it would stay pretty quiet. The first few months I really enjoyed the speaker. I guess you get what you pay for. I recommend investing in a better quality speaker.**********************************************************,5,1,2016-7-10,1,6,0
"I like this device, great sound, easy Bluetooth connectivity and nice battery life but there are a couple things that make it a 4 and not a 5.First, when charging, there is no indication when charge is complete. A red light comes on when you plug it in to charge but...and I’ve tested this over time...the light neither shuts of nor changes color when finished charging. A bit irksome. Second, the device makes a startup sound/tune when you turn it on, but nothing when you turn it off - the power light flashes & goes out - which means you absolutely have to pay attention when shutting it down lest you activate “Pairing” when holding too long.",4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0

"I have only good things to say about this speaker. Although the 100 foot range doesn't matter much to me, it is in fact capable of going a little further than that in my testing.What does matter is the sound that it produces, and that is quite respectable even at a long way away. I find it hard to believe it is only 10 W, because it can really put out some sound. So far after a month I average charging it around once a week, so it does go for a good long time without running down. It does not alert you when it is about to stop working which is only an issue if you are using a cord to connect it up with a MP3 player or some such thing. I only own an Apple phone so can't say to any other brand, but my phone reports the speaker battery level beside its' own power. I might just get a second since it is capable of connecting off of the first and acting like a small stereo.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,1,0
"I needed an affordable bluetooth speaker for my classroom that didn't sound tinny and would last all day on a single charge. This little speaker delivers! The sound quality is equal to my other more expensive speaker and carries throughout my classroom. The triangular shape is perfect for sitting on my shelf and there's no threat of it rolling off the shelf and onto a child’s head. The size is compact enough to fit into a medium-sized bag and leave room for a wallet and keys. The control buttons are easy to push and well camouflaged on the side, but still easily visible. I do wish the charging cable included was a little longer and that it came with a charging block but all in all I am completely satisfied with the quality of this product.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,1
"When this came in the mail, I about sat down and cried! It was soooo little! There is no way this is what I ordered! There is no way any sound at all is going to come out of this tiny thing! Boy, was I wrong! It came with a slight charge, so I thought I may as well try it before I send it back. I turned on my bluetooth, and with NO effort from me, it was sinced and it PLAYED! The sound was incredible! My hubs told me to turn it down, as we didn't want the neighbors, about 1/2 acre away, to have to listen to my playlist! It easily changes volume and music by my phone (of course, it is bluetooth, I KNOW THIS), but it worked easily. Even for those who are technologically impaired.  It holds a good charge and doesn't seem to get overheated, even by the pool in the sunshine....(we cover it with a towel, just in case.)

"This is an excellent speaker for listening to audiobooks. The sound quality is rich and deep, which helps you hear the voices even if they are muffled or high-pitched. The buttons are soft and easy to push and locate. It also has a decent speaker phone. The small size and flexibility (horizontal or vertical) make it easy to set anywhere as I move around. Since the the volume between the speaker and the phone are independent there is a great deal more flexibility with volume. It can be very loud when I’m gardening. And very quiet when I’m falling asleep. The sleep timer also comes in very handy. After the timer turns off my audiobook, the speaker turns  off after 15 minutes of no activity. Awesome!  It’s very comfortable to carry around. I also love that it’s Bluetooth connection signal is quiet and pleasant. The water resistance is also very handy if I need to touch it while doing the dishes. I highly recommend this speaker for audiobook listeners!",5,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0

Sometimes it's discoverable right away after you  turn it on, other times my devices can't find it - even if it's already a discovered device.

"I haven't had a good portable speaker like this for my lap top in a while.. on my previous 3 speaker sets, the wires always eventually come loose and the speakers end up breaking form all the moving around i do, because i like to move my lap top to listen to tunes in my shop.. WIRES NO MORE!!!.. i can Bluetooth this speaker to my phone or my lap top and just carry it anywhere in my house.. i have a three story house and the reach distance was amazing.. it never cut out going up to the attic rooms steaming from the basement.. the pause button works for you tube videos. i have a slight hassle switching from my lap top to the phone. i usually end up clicking the remove button from my laptop because i cant get it to just disconnect.. its faster to just remove it and then add it again when im back on my lap top. im going to buy another one especially for the lap top since its hard to disconnect. its very small and both speakers are built into the one unit which makes it sooo convenient for me.. you can see i brought it into my sew shop. the sound is amazing.. the bass is nice and i love my R & B old school.. im usually turning it down now instead of wishing they would be louder.. my old wires connected speakers don't compare to this.. the VOontZ Angle 3  is really nice and clean design and the tri-design makes it easy to carry from place to place- it doesn't take up hardly any space and i can prop my cell phone up against it as I watch videos in bed or listen to my meditations- i can move the speaker next to my pillow and turn it down low so Im the only one that can hear.. The speaker phone/mic does work well when its connected to my smart phone. the embossed controls are easy to braille/touch/find without looking.  The volume control can be controlled by either the speaker or connected device.

"Purchased (08/28/20) to use in place of plug-in type subwoofer/speakers for desktop PC computer. PRO: Sound quality is relatively decent (especially for the price) for a small, water resistant, wireless portable unit. CON: As compared to the original Bose Mini Soundlink (not Mini II), it doesn't have anywhere the same rich base quality and lacks just enough base that it reminds me of the old (tinty) AM/FM clock radios from 10-20 years ago. PRO: Unit comes with a USB/micro adapter for charging that can be left plugged in while using to keep the battery fully charged. PRO: Bluetooth connection is extremely easy as tested on an iPhone, iMac laptop and desktop PC. CON: bluetooth signal is quite sensitive to other boothtooth signals either from nearby devices it's been connected to previously or whatever. Meaning, it's connected to my desktop via bluetooth, but the signal can randomly kick out either because I used my iPhone's auto transcript for texting anywhere near it or all on it's own for an un-obvious reason. A quick push of the bluetooth connect button on the speaker rectifies the connection, but when it reconnects it comes on at 100% volume, causing you to (again) lower the sound level back down.",3,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0

Been on a couple kayak trips and it performed great, just got back from a 4 day camp trip and listened to it each afternoon/evening on a single charge.Sound quality is good. Not amazing but really good. Compared it against my one buddies $80 Denon & other buddies $100 JBL’s flip 4 and it held its own on loudness and quality. It was on par I felt with the Denon but the JBL was definitely a better, fuller sound. Again though, $100 speaker vs this one at just under $30 you really can’t go wrong in my opinion.

"Prior to ordering this I did some research in an attempt to find a low-cost way to improve the Amazon Alexa that lives in my kitchen.  The main requirement was that it had to stay powered on at all times, as I was going to place it up on top of my kitchen cabinets so it would always be available of use but would remain out of the way.  While doing research on it, I had read somewhere that this specific model speaker remains powered on, even if there is no current audio input being pushed to it.  I decided to give it a try, and must say I am thoroughly impressed!The speaker is very affordable ($20 when I purchased it), and the sounds quality is on par with much more expensive Bluetooth speakers.  Not only that, but it DOES stay connected to my Amazon Alexa even after hours of non use.  I can walk out into the kitchen first thing in the morning and Alexa is already connected and ready to go.

It did not last 90 days.I wanna shove it somewhere.",1,1,2019-10-27,1,1,0
"How have we lived without this for so long? We have three kids who love music and like having us put music on our phones while we’re outside playing. We needed something cheap that was water/dirt/dust proof so we could take it outside and has descent volume and sound quality. For the price, this speaker has phenomenal sound quality and volume. My kids can easily turn it on and off. My toddler has dropped it a bunch of times and it still works. We’ve even put it in my daughter’s bike basket during bike rides and ridden around with our music playing. We’ve gifted it to a few teen nephews/nieces and they’ve all loved it as well.",5,1,2019-4-10,1,1,0
"This speaker refuses to ""connect"" to Bluetooth. I follow the directions and have tried everything possible. The signal is extremely poor. I have gotten it to connect after trying 20+ times, however most times, it simply will not work. When I use other Bluetooth speakers, they connect immediately with no issue. I'm so disappointed with this speaker, I wish I could return it because I just am unable to use it due to Bluetooth connectivity. The few times it has actually connected, the sound quality is just fine and the battery lasts multiple hours.",1,1,2019-9-12,1,1,0

"I use several of these connected to Apple wifi hubs - they drive the ""Airplay"" from my itunes to every room in the house, plus the deck. It's taken forever to find a great little speaker I could use to fill this roll that met the criteria needed to work well for this. In particular, when they are plugged into AUX they ignore BlueTooth pairing. When they are plugged to power, THEY STAY ON so when I pull up my remote App and press play - sound comes out. i don't have to go wake them. I sometimes pull one to take on a trip and find the bluetooth is easy to pair, battery life is good and they sleep smartly so power is prefereved when they aren't playing music. I can't speak to the water performance but the Raindance is on a mostly dry shelf outside since with the AUX/Power port cover open, it's not gonna live up to the IPX7 rating ... but as that's in the back I rest easy knowing a sideways rain won't ruin the front of the speaker that might get some of that rain...",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"So my old Bluetooth speaker can not play while charging. This one does, that's a huge plus for a Bluetooth player. You often run into a situation that you want to listen to your music as normal while the battery life does not suspend. The volume is quite loud which is sufficient for the living room, garage, or office use. Another advantage is that the item also comes in a 3.5mm headphone jack which supports some older devices. The size of the thing is at a very sweet spot that allows you to carry it anywhere. You really can't expect more from such a low price. Perfect for anyone who don't ask for a premium sound and just wants something with the up-to-date spec and loudspeaker.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I use this speaker ever day.  Every day.  I listen to Youtube videos or Spotify while cleaning, showering, doing makeup, cooking, and working.  This speaker is CRAZY loud!  I can hear it clear across the house!  One left the house to go to college, and Spouse ""borrowed"" mine for his commute to work. So this is my 3rd--my mom bought one too.  How such high quality sounds comes from such a small speaker is bewildering.  Spouse is obsessed with movie soundtracks and the garage windows rattle when he cranks up the volume!  We have a cruddy store bought speaker we use nightly for thunderstorm sounds from Youtube and the quality difference is painful.  I love everything about this speaker!  The charge lasts for days with heavy use, and it lives on the edge of my bathtub most days (you get some great acoustics from the echo!)  I can use it in my noisy warehouse and hear every word spoken--it is just amazing.  If you are a person who wanders about listening to podcasts, videos, or music--this is perfect.",5,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
"I did not expect much from a 20 dollar speaker, but from all the positive reviews I read, I guess I was expecting more. I believe that most of the reviews that rave about the sound quality, are over-stated, to say the least. It just sounds, OK. Average. Nothing special. In fact, the speaker is a little bright on the high end, so much that I had to adjust my EQ to take out the shrill. The low end is pretty much non-existent, I didnot expect earth shattering bass, but I thought the low end would be less muddy. Final Verdict: It is small, has good battery life, and sounds better then a phone speaker, but...I am sure for 10-15 dollars more, you could get a better speaker. Recommended only if you are on a tight budget",3,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"The Objective:The speaker is compact, feels fairly well made and I had no problem connecting to it from multiple devices. The volume is quite impressive for the size, but the sound quality, especially in the low and mid ranges is very subpar.  The sound is awkwardly flat with various music genres and becomes borderline distorted when it comes to speech.",2,1,2020-7-20,1,0,1
"With my Samsung Tablet, and phone (the items I tested this on) there is something to remember. The sound volume is controlled by both the phone, and the speaker, if the speaker sounds low - one of these is set to low. That being said, this thing pumps out alot of sound for how little it is. The bass speaker is a down firing speaker, so it will do best on a hard surface, but also realize, this is a tiny speaker, it's not gonna be bumping that bass. However, given that limitation, it still does pretty well even with bass heavy music, within reason of course. I tried this on movies, music, and games, and in all instances, I was rather happy with it. For reference, if you were in your bedroom, this is more then enough to be very loud in that setting. This is a great little item at a hell of a good price. Cambridge Soundworks makes good stuff, and I've used alot of their stuff over the years, and this is just another good product from them, that I'll be using for a long time. Great little speaker.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"I bought this simply because of all of the great reviews boasting ""great quality sound!"" and because the price had been reduced to $27.99 from $99.99. I also needed to replace my old Bluetooth speaker that my wife accidentally dropped into the pool. I'm completely disappointed in this product. The sound quality is nowhere near what the raving 5 star writers would lead you to believe. I wasn't expecting professional quality sound, but I was expecting better than what I got. The speaker sounds exactly like you would expect a small cheap speaker to sound like: small and cheap. My old Bluetooth speaker was the Etekcity RoverBeats T3 Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, CSR 4.0. It was $19.99 and is superior to this product in every way.",2,1,2016-9-28,1,4,0

"First I need to state how I'm using this device, my hearing is damaged by 60% on the right side and 80% on the left, so I need a bluetooth speaker right next to me to hear without blasting the TV.At first I didn't like it at all, the delay of signal was very distracting and sounded like a poor echo system, but after talking to their customer service people and doing a little research myself, I found that the latency of any bluetooth device has always been there, I just happened to hook mine up in a way that allowed me to really hear it at it's worst.",5,1,2017-9-22,1,2,0
"I'm a little baffled by the high reviews. For the price I suppose this speaker sounds fine, but it severely lacks base. Maybe my speaker is defective, but it sounds only slightly better than my phone speaker. There's really very little base to be heard. At first I couldn't get the speaker to connect with Bluetooth, but after restarting the speaker a few times I haven't had that issue again and it connects easily. The battery life seems a little short, but it's not terrible. It's rare for me to not have the speaker plugged in for charging anyway. My biggest problem with this speaker is that the control buttons, which are matte finish raised symbols, are almost impossible to see unless in direct bright light.",3,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
Update - I have owned this speaker for two years now. It still sounds great.  I am still amazed at the sound that comes from this compact speaker.If you are wondering if the reviews are to good to be true STOP WORRYING and buy this speaker before Cambridge SoundWorks realizes they priced it too low.,5,1,2016-9-8,1,3,0
How can something so small play so loud and clear? This is my first Bluetooth speaker and I was going to go jbl or UE boom but when I factored in the price it came down to Oontz or Doss influenced by online reviews. A 5 buck coupon on Amazon helped my decision process. It arrived within 2 days almost fully charged and connected via Bluetooth to my galaxy s9 in about 3 seconds. Sound is outstanding for something so tiny. It grips easy in the hand and sits stable with 4 rubber feet on the bottom. Call clarity was very clear. In the box came a small lanyard and usb cable. I chose the rain dance for the waterproof build. The sound is rich and clear. Not very bass oriented but all around pleasing to the ear and it will fill a room very very nicely. I would absolutely buy this speaker again and in fact I  will to pair and play in stereo.,5,1,2019-5-16,1,1,1
"With Cambridge SoundWorks you are always guaranteed excellent quality.  I have been using their products for decades and still have a big pair of home theater speakers that are running strong after 15 years.  This very little guy of a speaker is very impressive.  It is so tiny and obviously very easy to carry anywhere.  Of all the bluetooth speakers I have tried this was the most portable.  The ease of the bluetooth connection was a mere few seconds and it would immediately find its last source and be ready to play.  The sound quality at lower to mid levels is awesome with crystal clear clarity added with just the right amount of bass.  For me the sound did get somewhat muddled at the higher volumes.  The speaker is indeed loud but I found the clarity slightly sacrificed.  I play my speakers on the higher end in my apartment and have found others to provide better sound quality with the highs.  I am not sure if outside the highs may indeed work much better with this speaker.The biggest plus here with this speaker is ease of connection and its quality in that it is solidly built and durable while holding a constant connection.  It never breaks up in the slightest.  I also think when it comes to sound quality it is honestly a matter of preference.  Everyone plays different types and styles of music, wants different highlights in their music.  Some want more bass while some want an enhancement of vocals or treble.  This speaker is an amazing value with impressive built quality.  I can highly recommend it.",5,1,2017-2-18,1,1,0
"No, I'm not an audiophile, just an average listener.  But this thing is FANTASTIC.For an amazing price, you get an attractive speaker, with a water resistant rating so I don't have to panic about a sprinkle.  There are two speakers for full stereo, and an additional amazing bass speaker on the bottom.

"I have actually purchased two of these items and have problems with both. Here is the situation:I owned an iPhone 7 Plus and used the blu-tooth connection to power this speaker. For well over a year it worked fine. Suddenly the volume dropped extremely low. I first thought that it was the speaker so, after trying several things, I ordered another one. The same problem existed. Then I just assumed it was the iPhone. I recently bought an iPhone 11 Pro Max and, to my dismay, the same problem existed with both of the speakers I had purchased.",2,1,2019-10-19,1,1,0
"My first impression is the speaker is very solid and well made.  It's smaller than another bluetooth speaker I have, but as I began testing, the sound is just as loud and even better quality.  I tested it with Metallica and AC/DC and it played the highs and lows and the bass with no distortion !!!I tested some of the specs that were given like the range of 100 feet for the bluetooth connection.  I didn't have a measuring tape, but I had the music playing from my laptop in the basement and the speaker on the 2nd floor still playing without issue.  I went to the deck which has to be 60 feet away, again no problem.",5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,1
"Great size, easy to connect, no tech issues or errors.  Overall, the sound is great and this speaker gets loud without any problematic distortion at high volumes. I found the mids a bit too strong (though they are clear) and the bass to be lacking. The treble seems about right - perhaps a bit bright but definitely not harsh.  I'm not sure how people can say this thing has good bass, even for its size.  I was not expecting much bass at all from this speaker given it's size, but there are comparable speakers out there that do have more bass (e.g. jbl core, anker soundcore). However, those speakers come at a higher price point and often the sound is more directional and fire sound forward, not up or 360 degres around. Plus, the bass in other speakers often comes with more distortion at higher volume levels.  For this speaker's intended use for me, I'd rather have clear, loud sound than more bass that sounds bad when cranking the volume up.The build quality on this unit is just great.",4,1,2017-7-14,1,1,0

"The sounds this little puppy puts out is quite amazing. I am a serious audiophile, but this unit outperforms all expectations for something this size, leave alone something this price. At top volume setting it's literally too loud for me, in a full size bathroom, even with my ears damaged from shooting and loud music. At reasonable listening volumes, the sound is clean and distortion free, and you know it's OK, because you enjoy your favourite music. This is no tinny sound, it's decently full spectrum.Don't expect huge bass, but the hint of bass drum, bass guitar, and low freq synth is all there.",5,1,2017-12-26,1,1,0
"This speaker has incredible sound for its size. It connects easily between my laptop and iPhone. I haven't measured the battery life, but it exceeds my expectations. Its small size makes traveling with it easy. It doubles as a speakerphone, and I might add it's the best speakerphone I've used. The bluetooth range is great. When using as a speakerphone, I can leave my phone in my office and carry the speaker anywhere in the house with no interference or disruption. It's water resistant, so it is great to use in the shower. The controls are well placed and give you the ability to pause, skip, and of course adjust the volume. When switching between devices, you don't have to use the device it's currently connected to in order to disconnect. Just press the bluetooth button to disconnect and then connect on your other device. Even outdoors, it has powerful sound. Excellent product.",5,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0

The battery life is really good.Most importantly,  I continue to be amazed by how Quickly it connects via Bluetooth every time I turn it on!

The volume gets pretty loud (my phone is on the lowest volume and it's a little loud for my space but I have my own office so it's ok.  If you are into the quality of the listening experience, then definitely spend the extra money for an upgrade. However, if you can't tell the different between the sound of a cheap speaker vs Bose, then by all means, purchase this and you'll be satisfied.",2,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0
"UPDATE: A year and a half later it’s still going. The only tiny problem is the charger no longer fits snuggly into the speaker. I just have to not move it while it’s charging so the cord doesn’t fall out. I’m okay with that.  Reviews are so entertaining, running the gamut from worst to best all for the same product. For me, using it as I do, it is perfect, an excellent value for the price.This is my third litte Bluetooth speaker in about a year or so. My first one cost double this one and sounded great until it quit for good after 6 months. I bought another, slightly less expensive, different brand. Fewer problems than the previous one but only lasted about 5 months. I live in a studio apt, iPhone and iPad are my only devices so I don’t need top-of-the-line and if I’m going to have to replace it every few months anyway I’ll do that if it’s not expensive. Best so far. I am very happy with it. The sound is full and rich, it looks good, unobtrusive, portable, no glitches, long life between charges and even if it does stop working in a few months (at least longer than the other two I hope) it will be worth it and I would buy it again.",5,1,2018-9-16,1,0,0

One is to connect to my Samsung tablet, whose on board sound is pitiful, so when I stream a video I can have respectable sound. Second as an extension to my Samsung S9 android phone. The phones speaker is OK (better than the tablet) but not great for across the room and moving around as I talk. There is a microphone on the top edge of the speaker that works just fine.

"I have four of these speakers and two of another brand.  The sound quality is certainly better than my phone, but nowhere near that of a decent speaker.

When it stops working, i.e. there is no connection w/ my phone, I have to get another of these speakers (I have four of this brand and two of another).  I sent one back because it wouldn't work out of the box.  The problem is intermittent and seems to be a function of the specific speaker within this brand.  The other brand I have never has this problem.  I'd send them back, but, of course, they're out of warranty.  Should the seller of this brand read this, I'd advise them to re-visit the technology they use for their Bluetooth before manufacturing any more.Until then I would definitely recommend not purchasing this product.",1,1,2019-2-10,1,0,0

Cure: purchased a Bluetooth transmitter for my SONY TV and used my Bluetooth earbuds. Problem ... had to take earbuds out to talk and wife couldn't hear. Purchased this speaker as a substitute. It's next to us and voice from streamed media is much clearer, especially when competing with loud background music (eg. Star Trek Discovery) or low spoken dialog (eg. Handmaiden's Tale). It's been a week. So far, so good.",5,1,2019-9-12,1,1,0
"The speaker sounds okay sometimes but can't handle anything with too much low end. It will actually shut itself off if I play some songs with my bass booster eq turned up but you don't want to listen to them that way anyway because it sounds like farts coming out of this speaker. The build quality, and sound quality is cheeper than the oontz angel 3 plus. That being said this speaker is amazingly LOUD for it's size and dose a good job in open areas. I have mine strapped to the handle bars on my electric scooter and let me tell you it can verry easily be heard over traffic rushing by. All in all its a decent speaker if your looking for something small and cheep you can throw arround that probably is not going to die on you throughout the day.

I literally just received the package half an hour ago and I have been playing songs and enjoying the powerful voice and quality.  Then I am surprised by the fact that it includes a microphone.  Well, let me tell you that I originally bought this because I recently purchased an iphone case that is waterproof.  Sounds good, right?  Yes, but what I did not realize is that the sound would also muffle the speaker and microphone because the case is sealed tight to prevent water damage.  Now that I have this beautiful speaker with microphone, I plan on using it as a speaker so I can understand people better and they can understand me better.  This little gadget has a powerful impact and now I can use it for 3 different purposes.  Life does not get sweeter than this.  Although, it is still very new to me, I fully recommend it to anybody and everybody.  You will not be disappointed.

It was very annoying and not acceptable. But then these problems disappear and even tho it sometimes disconnect, t connects back by itself (and it's very rare and for a minute or so). Otherwise, I'm listening on my comp speakers, switch this speaker on and it almost seamlessly connects to it and switch the sound from comp speakers to this.

Problem is, it stop charging! The charge port is loose because the design is poor. Always having the cable sit at angle creates pressure to one side.

While it's a bit too quiet to really use as a ""party"" speaker, it's perfect for use around the house, shower, or with a few friends, and it probably wont upset the neighbors. Speaking of the shower, a feature that I really enjoy is that it's water resistant. I wouldn't take it in the shower with me, but it holds up nicely against steam or counter-top spills. It also seems to have better bass than most of the smaller bluetooth speakers that I've used. The wifi range is great, I'd say it can reliably reach about 100 ft, but I've not really had the opportunity to really test it's limits. I literally use this daily lol",4,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0

I am more than pleased with not only the sound but the battery life is also quite surprising, I listen to probably 45 min-1 hour ea time I shower/shave & this little gem never ran through the initial charging...in fact it came charged & just yesterday charged it for the first time, taking only couple of hours to come back to full charge.

The Sony was originally 90$ but I got it on sale for 45$. I was trying to find something in the same price range (30-40$) to no avail. That's when I came across this speaker. I'm familiar with the brand so I decided to give it a try. At $25 I should have known that this speaker wouldn't quite live up to the Sony. I knew I would probably be disappointed when I picked up the box. It was way too light. The bass was lackluster at best. The sound quality is decent.

"Bought this a while ago and meant to leave a review but forgot! This has been amazing investment for the cost. It’s great for its size, great sound and the bass is excellent. I took it on a picnic and it performed well plugged into my phone. I’m planning to take it on a camping trip soon and it will be really good to listen to music from a decent speaker when you're out and in the middle of nowhere!The battery-life is really good and it connects to Bluetooth easily. All in all a really solid buy that I would be pleased to recommend to anyone. I will probably buy one of these for my friend who is always complaining that she can’t hear very well when she’s listening to her music in her greenhouse.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,1
"I'm just going to say right off that I thought the volume would have been louder.  I bought this speaker to connect to my iPad 2 to play music or listen to shows/movies with Netflix or stream a hockey game.  The volume just isn't there...in fact, I think the volume of my iPad speaker is louder than this speaker.  So a little disappointed in that.  But to the good, it's very portable and I bought the ""hard shell"" case to store/carry it in.  It connected easily to my iPad without a hitch and without having to really read the instructions.  I hesitate to recommend this Oontz based on the volume issues I'm having, but it will do in a pinch.***EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT***",5,1,2018-5-7,1,0,0

"I've owned my fair share of Bluetooth Speakers and this one has outperformed even some of the highest end speakers I have owned.  I use it primarily with my Note 12.2 GALAXY TABLET.  I HAVE TO SAY IT MAGNIFICENT.I have the case ""i-Blason Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 Case / Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 Case - Armorbox Dual Layer Hybrid Full-body Protective Cover with kickstand "" which is a perfect place for the Speaker to sit.  As far as the tight squeeze holds it in place, it is well balanced right there and makes holding the tablet and typing and listening to music though it a breeze.  If you have a Note 12.2 or a tab 12.2 you owe it to yourself to pair this speaker with that case. Literally wished I could bend the ears of just one designer at Cambridge and get them to build perfectly match ed speakers to attach to a variety of tablets where they just snapped on as easily as this inserts in the kickstand and holds in place.",5,1,2017-1-14,1,1,0
I have used this around the house as well as on trips. Really good sound for such a small speaker.After about 18 months it died. When I tried to charge it the speaker over-heated.

"I never used a a Bluetooth speaker before so I didn't know quite what to expect. I must say that this speaker exceeded my expectations in usability, the quality, and sound. The instructions that come with this are very clear and easy to understand. The speaker does everything the instructions say it will do when you pair it to whatever device you were going to use it with. I use it in the bathroom while taking a shower but I don't let it get wet. I can hear it just fine from the bathroom sink even with the shower running! I added a small piece of velcro to the bottom so that I can move it around in my car, which doesn't have speakers, to prevent the Sun from beating down on it during the 100-plus degree days we've been having over here in the east. All that is to say, I don't bully it,so I don't know for sure how well it will do if you bully it. For $30 bucks it can't be beat.",5,1,2018-8-15,1,0,1
"I am not the pickiest of audiophiles, but this little speaker is easy to use and has decent sound quality at low levels and fairly close to me.  Will is fill a large room with fabulous sound?  I tried it as an experiment in a decent size living room with vaulted ceiling.  I got sound throughout the room, but perhaps not the most rich of sound.  Why did I buy this speaker?  I sleep better when listening to ""white noise"" type sounds.  My old speaker/iPod /iPhone charger developed a nasty crackle and tinny sort of overall sound.  This Ountz speaker is FABULOUS to sit on the nightstand and plays all night long without battery discharge.  The sound quality when the device is close to me is nice.  Best of all, this speaker helps me sleep when I would otherwise have trouble sleeping.  It charges quickly.  Pairs to a device easily.  Fills a hotel room with the sounds that relax me and helps blur out other travelers.  At home, it helps drown out barking dogs, traffic and other humans so I can sleep.

"OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) - purchased twiceFor a 12V speaker, the OontZ Angle 3 is pleasantly loud.  Originally purchased primarily for listening to audiobooks and classical music whilst travelling, it renders both vocal timbre and orchestral range with surprising clarity, and really, if you want greater definition, think about plonking out $300+, not $25.  The sound fills a small room louder than conversational level; in a medium-sized room with minimal background noise it can be used for audiobooks or comfortable level music.  The small form factor makes this speaker extremely portable in luggage or handbag.  It comes packaged with a USB-microUSB charging cable and a 2 foot audio connector cable.",3,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0

"Fair budget speaker but, and it's HUGE But! I was fine with it for about 5 months. First thing to act up was the USB port. It was never really good but I could charge the unit. After that it required the most delicate touch to get the adapter to find the sweet spot. Now at month 8 it's not charging at all. The reason, some of the USB adapter male connections broke loose. CHEAP materials is the culprit. Also At about month 6 the Bluetooth was dodgy. It would not connect automatically. I had to either turn the unit on and off or the device. BTW I only have one BT speaker and use use it for only one device while in my hobby room. So there was no overriding signal. For that reason Is why it only gets one star and a buyer beware. I just replaced it with a VTIN unit. I hope that budget unit last more than 7,1/2 months...",1,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"This mini speaker meets all my needs and has exceeded my expectations. It's perfect for what I wanted; something to boost the music on my phone and tablet. I like to listen to music in my living room and on the deck. Didn't need anything totally waterproof. It gets quite loud and has a clear, pleasant sound.

"Out of the box, this thing is great. It has very quality sound for this small of a unit. Gets plenty loud. You can control sound dynamics via the connected device's equalizer settings. Build quality is nice - feels nice to the touch and has good weight to it. I don't see a way to determine the volume level of the unit.  As best I can tell, there are 15 clicks from no sound to full volume. Setting at 8-9 clicks, and adjusting PC volume accordingly, yields nice volume levels for me. The unit had some connectivity issues, but turning off bluetooth on the unit and then turning back on has resolved this thus far.Update: 11-17-18 - Works awesome. Connecting to phone gives me battery % left on speaker. Battery has lasted many hours/charge thus far.",5,1,2018-11-19,1,0,0
After less than 30 minutes of play the device began to crackle and cut out eventually loosing the pairing signal completely. I thought it felt a little hot so I alowed it to cool down fo a few hours. I re-charged and restarted the unit thinking maybe a fresh charge would help. After 5 minutes it started to break up again.  When using the device my iPhone was never more than 6' away.

"Cambridge Sound Works OontZ Angle 3 - I really liked this the first couple of months I had it. The sound wasn't outstanding but it worked perfect for watching Netflix movies from my Samsung Galaxy tablet. I just wanted a louder sound than my tablet provided. I've probably physically used it 30 times and the last 15 times I've had to reset my bluetooth several times on my tablet before my speaker would connect. I'd hear the noise it's connected -push the speaker volume up, down, up -nothing... reset the bluetooth on my tablet again, hear the disconnect then reconnect and then FINALLY it'd connect. Now all I hear is the connect and disconnect noise.. no amount of resetting will get it to connect.One thing I didn't like about this speaker is that you have no way of telling how much charge it has -ever. So usually when I went to use it I had to have it plugged into the wall charging, which lets face it, doesn't make it very portable. As many other reviewers write the buttons are cheap and you're never really sure they are working or if it's just that the unit is broke.",1,1,2017-2-10,1,1,0

"The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars, is that after 2 years of use, the little spot on the speaker where you plug in the charger, became loose and I was no longer able to charge my speaker because it wouldn't make a connection. If I would charge the speaker while driving, the cord would fall off of the speaker just from the mild jiggling of the car on the road. I am skeptical that a new cord would work on it, so I am not spending the money to find out. I am surprised that happened because I hardly ever had to charge this speaker! SO, I would say, if you are going to buy this speaker, only charge it at home on the countertop, where there is ZERO chance of movement, to keep that charging port from getting bumped or wore out. Otherwise, this was a darn good little speaker.",4,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
I bought this speaker to use at the beach and also at my desk at work.  It works beautifully for what I need.  I took it to the beach last week and it was just what we needed.  It's small enough to not take up too much room but the sound quality is great.  I used it for about 5 hours last week and I have used it 5 days in a row at work - all day long - and I have just had to charge it today for the first time.

"I just purchased this if I find any issues I will add them later. I love to fish and I take my iPod to the dock with me and while I wade and fish I listen to music. I had a pair of cheap speakers that plugged into my iPod they sounded okay, but you really couldn't hear them over the water. I thought Okay I'll give this a try, I read a couple of the bad reviews and figured well they didn't do something right. I plugged it in and let it charge It took the Bluetooth instantly. so no real setup needed the first thing I noted in the directions and I am going on a limb here it is not windows friendly.  It is however Apple friendly and works with all my devices.  Now I can't say for sure, about windows since I avoid them like the plague but that's me. The directions even try to explain what do do for window users.  I read some of the better reviews and figures for 25 bucks I can't go to wrong.I am glad I spent it, first they are nice and loud, for tiny speakers I was impressed by the quality of the audio output they had. I listen to a wide variety of rock, and these speakers handled everything I played even the bass was incredible!  Now I'm a sound nut, I like true stereo sound not the crap they push as sound these days. so I was pleasantly surprised when these lived up to the reviews I had read.  Now don't think these are waterproof they are far from it so I don't suggest showering since the bottom is full of holes. They are splash resistant which means if you have them by the pool and your wee one splashes some water on them they won't fall apart.",5,1,2016-9-14,1,1,0

"I’ve had this now for over two years and I’ve waited to review this until now to make sure it was a durable and long-lasting, quality product. Indeed, the quality, both in terms of sound and durability, are excellent. It has the best sound for its size that I’ve ever experienced in a Bluetooth speaker and I’ve had ZERO issues with it in the entire 2+ years I’ve owned it. It’s been used in places where water splashes and I’ve dropped it from chest high onto hard surfaces dozens of times and it’s still going strong. This works fantastically for its intended purposes and I completely recommend it for that. People that are expecting this to emulate a home entertainment system should probably get a home entertainment system. Don’t risk an investment in poor quality products from unknown manufacturers with no accountability that operate without consumer advocacy. This is an American manufacturer so I would imagine it operates within the trade/business guidelines/standards set in America although I’ve never had to test this assumption considering I’ve never had an issue with the product.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0

I never knew how much I was missing out on until I set this up. I was listening to clear loud music within minutes. I took it to different rooms around my apartment and the quality didn't change at all! The farthest was about 20 ft away.

I use this with my phone while listening to Sirius Radio. I use it every day around the house and when going for walks. I don't like using headphones because I can not hear cars coming. My wife also walks with me so headphones would not work. The OontZ can really be turned up loud without distortion. We use it camping - not too loud to disturb nearby campers of course.  I really love this device. No problems using Blue tooth which allows turning up the music the loudest. The supplied cable for connecting from phone to OontZ works fine but is not as loud or seems not as clear. So far this is the best buy and enjoyment of a product I have purchased in years. I even took the OontX to the American Legion to listen to 60/70s music in the back hall while have a few beers and people started to walk in from the bar to listen. I am thinking about buying a few more for Christmas gifts. I have not yet tested the battery life of 6+ hours but so far good.,5,1,2018-10-11,1,0,0
"I got this speaker first for the price and ratings. It helped prove that having a bluetooth speaker next to my chair in the living room made a huge improvement in my television viewing (as my audiologist had suggested). There was some latency though of about a half-second, so I did some homework about bluetooth transmitters, speakers and latency. First step was to swap out the transmitter connected to the television; it had aptX but hung behind the television with a short cord. Then I purchased the Shenen bluetooth 4.2 speaker and the Deripus bluetooth 4.2 speaker. Never got any sound from the Deripus other than the speaker telling me it was paired. The Shenen crackled so often with intermittent communications in the first hour that it was obviously not a long term solution (even for the night). So I hooked up the Cambridge OontZ. It paired easily, and the lag with the new transmitter is barely noticeable but acceptable. Very happy with the volume controls  (lowest volume on Shenen was way too loud for me and the rest of the family), and it has the bass I need (also missing from the Shenen).",4,1,2017-6-26,1,1,0

There are much better quality speakers with deep rich bass, which this is not. But the prices on those are often well over $100. I don’t want to travel with something like that. This one has a very nice sound quality at a price that won’t matter much if it gets damaged or lost.  It sounds a little nicer when the volume isn’t on full blast. It was very easy to set up to Bluetooth but it also has an auxiliary jack, which is perfect if you have a device with out Bluetooth or a poor signal. I would definitely recommend this speaker.",4,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0

"I was so happy to receive this wonderful piece of gadgetry from Amazon at such a great price. This little sucker impressed me right out of the box. It has great, clear sound and even some nice bass to it! Nothing too fancy, but it'll do in a pinch. It also has an auto-shut off feature, which I need to explore more to be clear on the when timer shuts it off. I believe it's got to be about 10 minutes after going idle. As far as performance, I can only speak of what I hear in my car. I bought it to replace the built-in speakers because they're old and have too much feedback. Once I turn on the OontZ, a first-time passenger would never know that it wasn't coming from the car. In fact, I had a friend riding with me and he thought I had gotten my built-in speakers fixed!But anyway, I've noticed that the further away the speaker is from you, the better the sound. When it's close up, the sound is a little mono; which is to be expected from a portable speaker. I'm no audiophile, but I would say that if you couldn't get your hands on a Bose, this affordable little guy will be your next best bet. This speaker was a steal at $30, considering it retails at $90, so you won't hear too many complaints from me. However, I had to take off a star because of the volume. With the OontZ on max, to get maximum sound on my smartphone, I only need to set it to just two clicks under max (depending on the quality of the mp3). That usually does the trick, but sometimes driving around on the freeway or in bad weather can drown out the sound; even at absolute max on both gadgets. One time, the volume reset itself, which is fine, but I like to put the speaker in the back of my car so that it has better coverage area. I don't want to stop the car somewhere and reach back there just to turn it back up. But other than that, I highly recommend this speaker if you're looking for better sound and don't want to invest $400 to get a new sound system for your car or room.",4,1,2016-8-27,1,1,0
"This speaker has a 5 Star rating from me FOR ITS SIZE. This is a small speaker with big sound, but it obviously won't replace a home sound system, unless yours was made in Badsoundistan. One problematic area is the difficulty in seeing the volume, off/on, and other controls. They are black on a black speaker and do not show up well except in bright light. I did not take a star away though, because I could see how this could make the speaker appearance appear cheap. And, having once located them, they are not difficult to find. Besides, you'll mostly use Alexa to control it anyway.The small size, though giving up a bit in sound fidelity, is perfect for carrying around the house, porch, deck, roof, wherever you want to use it.

"Hope I don’t confused anyone but I actually give this 4 stars. Just feel you need to know before you buy that bass is non existent. I was disappointed the second I heard the music and felt let down after watching a few vids and reading the comments on how great it sounded. Everything else was just about right and for that reason I give it 4 stars (considering the price). Some Pros: clear as described, nice highs and mids, construction. Again little to no bass, for this reason it sounds clear on high volume because bass is absent. Given the cost $27 I give it 4 stars but would definitely lose stars if price were to go up. For the $27 it's not really a bad deal. Honestly, if it were more convenient I would return it. Again don’t mean to confuse nor discourage you from getting this, just know that there is no bass.I am a dj and sound engineer by the way.",1,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
"**UPDATE**The good people @ Cambridge Soundworks read my review below...& I think it made them sad because they got in touch with me to talk about my poor ka-put Oontz Speaker. Like me, they were shocked @ it's short life of service because they believe in their product. So they promised to send me a new, in the box, Oontz. I thought suuuuurrre. I'll hold my breath & wait for that to show up. Imagine my happy surprise when I discovered my new as Oontz as promised, in a few days. The sound on this little speaker is amazing. Connectivity is dummy proof because I was able to connect it to my phone within 30 seconds of unboxing it. I have to imagine it must be a quality item if the company cares enough to replace it purely from a disgruntled customer's review.

I'm mainly using this speaker in my bathroom however teach yoga classes and have been using it for outdoor classes. It's small and has great sound. I never have to turn the volume all the way up. Great battery life compared to others.,5,1,2020-7-29,1,2,1
"I bought this speaker back in 2017 and I have had no problems with it since.  It still works and pairs easily, and the sound has not deteriorated over the past couple years.To be fair, I am not a person who uses this speaker (or any BT speaker) constantly, so perhaps that has kept it working so well for much longer than it seems to have for others.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"For what it is, this speaker performs remarkably well. At 10 watts, I think it's perfect for an office or small, enclosed environment. I purchased several of these as gifts and one was a Christmas present for my daughter, who likes to listen to music she has on her iPhone. At 14, it's popular music and an occasional classic by the Red Hot Chili Peppers--whatever her older brother might be liking at the time. I have experience with three other Bluetooth speakers: Jam Classic, Anker Premium, Bose SoundLink Mini. Of the speakers I've heard, the SoundLink Mini has the best balance of clarity and bass, but at 6x the cost. My next choice is the OontZ Angle 3.I ordered speakers in black, red, and one with the pink grill for my daughter, and they came exactly as shown in the photos. I tested it out with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2, a 15"" MacBook Pro, and an iPhone 5c. Thus far, two months later, no connection issues with any of those devices. My daughter seems delighted and I can hear the music from her bedroom and bathroom with the doors closed, so it's plenty loud.",5,1,2015-12-22,1,2,0
"Stylish speaker, quickly connects to iphones/ipad. Sound Is not as good nor as loud as my other portable speakers. Battery dies quicker, too. Most of all, the power connector on the speaker is loose, under normal use eg usually left plugged in, sometimes unplugged to use same charge cable for one of the other portable speakers; none of the other brand speakers’ power connectors are loose. Recommend Jam Plus instead of this speaker. I have 2 of these and both speakers have same issues, one is at my office and one at home. Initially was great, but didn’t hold up as well as other portable speakers. I’ve had this about a year.",3,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"This Oontz Angle 3 speaker always struggles to connect to my macBook Pro's Bluetooth.  When I initially power it on, the Bluetooth connection is always awful, and the resulting sound is full of static.  I always need to disconnect the speaker and reconnect it a second time.  If the speaker is running on battery, I occasionally need to power it back on, before reconnecting it.I just bought an Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker (actually 2), and am much happier - both in terms of Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality.  The Boom 3 is also completely waterproof, instead of ""water resistant.""  I realize it's *much* more expensive...",3,1,2018-11-21,1,1,0
"I purchased this in Aug 2018 and just got around to using it this week and it is dead.  Figured maybe since it has been awhile maybe just the battery needed charging so charged a few days and still dead.  Nothing, will not turn on even when plugged into the charger just does not do anything.",1,1,2019-7-10,1,3,0
"This tiny speaker sounds petty good to me, so I can't complain about that. The volume gets as loud as I'd ever want it to be, and it doesn't sound tinny.It stays charged for hours, making it ideal for, as an example, playing holiday music all day.",4,1,2018-2-11,1,0,0
"I use this as a classroom speaker, at home listening, working out, listening while skateboarding, and I use this as a portable electric guitar amp with the near-zero latency audio through the headphone jack, and it sounds AMAZING. The bass is deep and clear, and the battery life always exceeds my needs. I plug a Shure SM58 microphone and Telecaster into a USB interface, into Ableton Live, then route the audio through the Oontz and it is more than loud enough to fill a room.I bought and researched many different speakers like this, but this one stands out because of it's ability to have less than 1 millisecond audio delay when using the 1/4"" headphone jack. I've bought 2 at one point and am considering splitting audio to play a stereo set too.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"I receive mine and charged it fully. I tested it and the music played almost 14 hours. The sound quality is great for what I need which is something to take with me in hotel rooms when I travel.  I have a JBL charge which I take to the beach and pool which is much bigger and much louder and much more expensive. I had no problems with the Bluetooth connectivity. I walked to the mailbox and back and it was still playing when I returned,  and I was well out of range. Overall very impressed for the money. Interesting how many people have problems with these,  maybe they have various factories making them and I got lucky and got a good one.

"Sound quality was not great.  They sounded like small inexpensive speakers.  I bought two with the expectation of having a right and a left channel.  I tried to hook them up that way but they wouldn't allow me to connect more than one at a time, even though my phone supports that functionality.  I saw other comments that said this would work.  I found that those comments were not correct for the speakers I received.  Bluetooth 5.0 or above is required for both devices for that to work.  There was no indication within the packaging of what Bluetooth version they were.  I suspect less than Bluetooth 5.0, however.",3,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Pretty solid deal for a speaker. It’s loud enough to hear through the other room/house, but also ain’t excessively loud to were neighbors can hear it. Please note that it does have its own volume button so for max sound, make sure your phone audio is all the way up, and so is the speaker. The sound quality I can’t give a 5 star, bc I know there are way better options with more bass/treble etc and with it on max volume, you can tell when it’s pushing it. But over all a great deal especially if you’re just looking for a decent speaker for music. I got mine for when I work on my car outside.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0

"I was setting up my old cell phone to be my bedside alarm clock.  I quickly found that the phone's internal speakers were tinny and not doing the job.  So, the Oontz BT speaker was on sale ($5 coupon) at Amazon, and had  4.5 stars.  But the best thing is it remains on and paired all the time, if it's plugged into power.  (A different BT speaker I had around had an auto shutoff of power and BT after a while, which made it useless as an alarm clock speaker).The speaker is small and light, but the sound and bass are really good.  It has TWO speakers in it, plus a bass speaker in the bottom, which really gives the sound 'dimension'.",5,1,2018-9-1,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker in August of 2016. The sound is great, carries well when it’s turned all the way up, and also great on the lower volume settings for ambient sound. You can change the sound by directing the speakers toward or away from yourself or a wall to project or mute the sound. It charges in an hour, and stays charged for a week of constant use (about 3-4 per day). It always connects with no issue to my iPhone or my friends’ androids. It is currently April of 2020, and my speaker has stopped maintaining a charge, so I’m buying a new one! This is a great speaker for the price, I’m very pleased.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
I'm so happy I purchased this speaker you just don't know!!!! I was looking for a speaker at a brick and mortar store I'm glad I didn't. I read lots of the reviews people had left. I also looked at the pictures to get an idea of how big it would be. Thank you to the folks who took time out to leave reviews and pics its much appreciated!!!! I recently purchased the item ITS JUST WHAT I WANTED NO LIE!!!!! I even got it at a GREAT PRICE!!! I almost spent money that was much more expensive. Not sure why I didn't check here before but I'm glad I did. I have a prime membership I get things within 2 days. I was so juiced to get it. the sound is great nice and loud. the bass is cool too. I found myself having to turn it down lol. My husband came in from another part of the house to say turn it down lol. He said it sounded loud and strong. It already came ready to use right out the box. I was looking for something to listen to while I was in my bedroom or around the house cleaning up I found it in this speaker. Amazon boy I'm so glad I decided to join it I love it. I don't even travel to the downtown area to shop I run to Amazon every time I need anything. I tell people ALLLLL the time I got it on Amazon they look like are you serious lol. thank you to the staff for ALWAYS BEING THERE DAY OR NIGHT TO HELP ME!!! I will be ordering another one later for my new house soon. THANKS AGAIN AMAZON!!!!!,5,1,2016-11-8,1,1,0
This was a great little speaker--when it worked. I originally purchased this 8/17. Worked great then all of a sudden died almost a year later. Customer service gave me the option of sending it in for repair or purchasing a refurb for $9.99. Done. Got the refurb speaker (7/2018). Again this one lasted almost one year. It died two weeks ago.,1,1,2019-7-3,1,2,0

"Update- below is my initial review. I was very happy with this purchase right up to the moment it quit working for no reason.  This little speaker was in my office, sitting on a shelf in a climate controlled environment. I only charged it when needed. It was only used for approximately 1-2 hours per day.Excellent small speaker with big, clear sound. Easy to connect with the blue tooth. Good battery life.",1,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0
"Updated Review — I was happy with this item, however the micro usb style charging port is no longer working. I’ve had this item for a year, and used it only occasionally. I may have charged it 10x total, there is no reason for it to be broken other than poor quality. 5star to 1starOriginal Review — This is not a boom box, but for the price it seems a great little unit. I have a big JBL Extreme that I use for music, but I like this for audio books. Also, of all the Bluetooth devices I've ever used, ear buds, stereos, you name it, this has the best connectivity, it's flawless! I’ve been using it on occasion for a few months now.",1,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"This is the perfect speaker for what I was looking for. I needed something small, portable, with good sound, that held a charge... I workout/train in the evenings - mostly alone or with a partner, usually outdoors or in my garage or at the park, not in a big gym with a bunch of people - and need something to play my music over. This has been PERFECT for all those things, as well as just being super easy to have with you at all times (we've used during spontaneous picnics at the lake with the kids, bike riding, playing while on little hikes, putting by the bathtub... It's easy to connect to, has good clear sound, and has kept a charge plenty long enough for normal people doing normal things (Example... It has kept a charge for 5 days of use before having ro recharge, which included 3x 1.5 hour workout sessions; 1x 1 hour hike; 1x 1.5 hour picnic; and a couple of baths. I would say that for the money, this is an excellent purchase so far if you are looking for basic, functional, portable, easy)",5,1,2018-4-24,1,0,0
"I've gone through a handful of speakers, trying to find a compact, convenient, good-sounding, affordable, wireless one and I think I finally found it. :) I haven't really had any problems with this for the past 3 months and that's coming from someone that has gotten speakers that start glitching and sounding bad a week after use... (but of course that's probably expected since I didn't want to buy anything over $30-40....)The sound quality is good and it can get pretty loud (I've used it for outdoor group workout sessions). The only thing is that your phone or whatever you are using via Bluetooth should always be nearby and probably within a few feet, otherwise the music will start cutting in and out and it's unbearable (worst case scenario I think that an aux cable would be fine and have no problems). If that does happen though, I just put my phone next to it and continue doing whatever I'm doing. Sometimes it doesn't do that and I can keep my phone on my desk while the speaker is across the room, but it might just depend on the speaker.... not entirely sure.",5,1,2017-1-14,1,1,0

"Funky on and off switch. Must hold for two second to turn, which it usually does without a problem, sometimes is a little balky. But will not turn off most of the time. Supposedly if you push the switch for two seconds it will turn off, but I find that sometimes I have to repeat that many times. Sometimes it simply will not go off. After 30 minutes it without use it will go off by itself. I wish I could click it off simply and surely, say, when I get a phone call or other similar situation where I don't want to fumble for ten second, or longer.Also, the + - and Bluetooth and on/off button are hard to find on the black model (See photo-can you find the buttons? Neither can I). I find myself rolling it over and over looking for these buttons. In dim light, almost impossible to see.",2,1,2020-1-13,1,0,1
"I use this in the shower every day for 5-7 minutes. It's lasted for at least 15 days on 1 charge. Blows the battery life of the $300 Bose Bluetooth speaker that was a gift to me away. As far as sound comparison between the only thing the Bose beats it in is bass. The Bose has (if I had to just quantify it) probably %40 more bass than this specific model (OontZ Angle 3 New Enhanced Edition). This is less than %10 of the price so this dollar for dollar value absolutely annihilates it. If I had the choice between receiving the two as a gift I would choose this one, it sounds nearly just as good, the battery life is already 3 times better (had to charge the Bose once every 3 or 4 days), and it's lighter and just by holding the two I feel like the OontZ is waaay more likely to survive a drop than the the Bose because the Bose weighs like 4-5 lbs even though it's the same size.",5,1,2018-9-18,1,0,0

"If you're looking for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that puts out great sound, look no further!! This thing ROCKS!! I've been in the market for quite some time for an affordable Bluetooth speaker but have been hesitant to pull the trigger on many of the less expensive products on the market simply because you usually get what you pay for. Not wanting to pay hundreds of dollars for something I may use occasionally made it difficult to find a good fit for my needs. Well, I recently took the time to research a few offerings and found that the OontZ Angle 3 had a pretty high customer review rating while having a very low price. So I decided to take the plunge and ooooh, what a plunge! The Oontz Angle 3 far exceeded my expectations!!! The overall sound quality that comes out of this tiny speaker is shocking! Even the quality of the lows is respectable. I'm so impressed and satisfied that I'm considering buying additional units for our guest bedrooms so each guest can listen to whatever they choose. I only hesitate because these things get pretty loud and having multiple units going at the same time may disrupt our household peace. :)  Anyway, I've never owned or heard any of the higher priced Bluetooth speakers (like Beats, Bose, JBL, etc.) but I am completely satisfied with the quality of this product and would buy it again in a heartbeat!",5,1,2017-11-2,1,0,0
"This is the third speaker I've bought for my all-in-one computer. Overall, I've been happy with the computer, but the speakers are not the greatest. The two previous speakers were pairs. Both USB connected. Maybe that was the problem because after plugging them in, they were no louder than the built-in computer speakers. I anxiously awaited this OontZ speaker as it was going to be my last try. I should have made sure the volume was down before I paired it, because wow! This little speaker has some serious sound, and the quality is amazing. I'm very impressed, especially for the price!",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"I didn't realize how small this device is, but it's the perfect speaker for me. As I expect from CSW it has a big speaker sound, and it's got a great (distance) range. I use it a lot beside my bed to play myself to sleep at night, and one night I started a DVD musical on my laptop in the other room and was able to let the DVD play me to sleep in my bedroom.It's also perfect for listening to podcasts in the shower. My old speaker doesn't have the volume or clarity to really use in the shower, but this speaker was perfect. I'm even able to put it on my towel bar and listen to The Hamilcast, as you can see in my picture. I'm looking forward to using it so much to listen to things in the shower, whether it's music, podcasts, or even a streamed news broadcast. I wish I had bought this a lot sooner.",5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,1

This is the third Oontz I’ve had. The first one that was used daily lasted for years. Even after dropping it several times and traveling with it it just kept going. It still works but has a short in the outlet so I ordered a new one. This has a different style but works great. The only thing I don’t like is the on/off button. It can be difficult turning off. The old one has a small switch which worked much better.,4,1,2019-10-20,1,1,0

The price was excellent and the sound quality far surpasses expectations for the price. Bass is decent for the speaker size (don’t forget these are it 10” woofers)Bluetooth is fairly easy to set up but reconnection is 80% pretty good bits bit finicky.,5,1,2019-4-11,1,1,0
"When I first got this in June of 2018, the battery life lasted easily 6-8 hours of continuous play before needing to be recharged.  Now, 18 months later, the battery takes 5-6 hours to fully recharge and will not last a full hour of playback before dying.  Contrast that with the iPhone 7+ I use to stream to it that I bought in Sept of 2016 and my iPhone can still last several hours of continuous streaming/browsing etc.  Therefore one can only conclude that the Oontz Angle uses a low-grade cheap rechargeable battery with short lifespan.  There is no obvious way to disassemble the Angle for battery replacement.  Sound quality is okay, blue tooth range is good, but the lifespan of this product is way too short.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I really loved it in the beginning. The sound was fabulous, and the battery life was excellent. I only use it when I'm away from home, so a couple times a month average. About 6 months in, a ringing noise started, as if there was a wiring issue, or it wasn't plugged in all the way. I bought another connector, but the issue continued even on Bluetooth. The battery started to fail as well, and it no longer kept a charge unless the charger was on it full time. Today, it died completely. While the price was excellent, I'll be looking for something else that lasts a little longer.",2,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying I LOVE this speaker. My issue is with the charger cord not staying in the speaker to charge. I bought this speaker in early Sept, a month and a half ago. There’s a small tab you lift to put the charger in. I think this tab applies too much pressure and creates a charger that no longer fits. The charger literally FALLS RIGHT OUT of the speaker. The USB portion has no errors or defects. The fact that the cord will no longer stay in the speaker means I CANNOT CHARGE THE SPEAKER. So I know once it dies, I won’t be able to use the speaker anymore. Which is too bad bc it’s a good quality speaker. And the battery does hold. It’s just the cord no longer fits. Whether that’s the cord portion or the speaker portion, my issue is with the cord not staying in the speaker. So I DO NOT recommend buying the speaker if u want to use it longer than 1 month.",1,1,2018-10-17,1,1,0
"** I changed my review to three stars because the company reached out immediately and sent me a replacement. I’ll update again when I’m satisfied this one doesn’t disconnect but their customer service is incredible. **I bought this for my shower to listen to music and *hopefully* not wake up my kids. It was AMAZING at first, worked well, and the battery life was great. About 4 months in it stopped syncing with my Bluetooth. I would follow all the steps in the instructions, get it resynced, and after a song or two it would un-sync again. I've gone through the process a couple times hoping it would work THIS time.

"I am an experienced audiophile fully aware of small speaker limitations. Based on the reviews of this BT device I bought it, and anticipated reasonably superior sound quality. Compared to many other similar speakers, this is utterly unexceptional. Sound quality is poor.  There is no bass whatsoever.  The claimed 10W power is absurd by any standard. I am sorry I wasted my money on this thing.  It is absolutely no better than any of the much less expensive BT speakers out there.  Do not waste your time or money.  Nothing this size will have any bottom end, so why spend more?",2,1,2018-11-14,1,1,0

These speakers only seem to last a year at best. I had the same use with both, the charging port it messes up pretty quickly no matter how gentle you are. I've had to wiggle it around to find the right spot for a couple months now and today it's not charging at all. Same time with my first one after a year of use.

"First off, I have owned a bunch of Bluetooth speakers and have listened to many more that friends and family have owned. I bought the Oontz Angle 3 because at $20 and the 28,000 plus reviews I felt it would be a no brainer. When I received it I noticed how small and light it was. I looked it over and was impressed with the construction quality, fit and finish. I plugged it in immediately to charge it up. When I connected it to my phone it was super simple and immediate. I will be honest I wasn’t expecting Bose sound to come from this unit as it just didn’t have the weight I thought it took to reproduce that sound. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The sound balance on this speaker is amazing. The highs are crisp and loud, the mids are exactly where they should be and the bass depends on what the speaker is sitting on. At first I had it on the seat of my vehicle and the bass was lacking, but I put it on my folding table in front of my camper and it sounded like a much much bigger speaker. Because it’s a down firing passive reflector it for one takes some use before the reflector as well as the main speakers loosen up. For two you need to put this speaker on something hollow like a table that exemplifies the reverberated bass. Over all this is the best water resistant  speaker you can buy for under $100 and is a total steal at $20. Trust me, people will be amazed at how much full sound comes from such a compact speaker.",5,1,2018-8-7,1,0,0
"Great for amping up your device's volume. There's no distortion or tinny sound. I've connected my Oontz to my phone, tablet, and laptop and they all work well.Note for non-techno people: the device can only be connected to ONE Bluetooth device at a time. If you want to switch between devices (phone to laptop), you need to turn off the Bluetooth on your phone and then turn on and connect the Bluetooth on your laptop. It can be frustrating if you forget and then wonder why you can't connect.",5,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
I wasn't too sure about buying this but figured for $25 give it a chance.  I've never had a bluetooth speaker so I was reallly thinking it would be just a bit louder than my phones speaker.  Wow - I was wrong.  This speaker while very small delivers rich quality with a surprising amount of bass.  Volume on it is great - I can turn it up and be working on the other side of the shop.  Battery life has so far been excellent - I've ran it at least 6 hours but never had to charge it back up.  Excellent value for money and I will be purchasing an additional one following this post!,5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"There's nothing to dislike here.  It's a tiny 3"" x 6"" (very approximate) speaker that delivers big sound with a charge that lasts a long time.  I bought this for the kitchen while doing dishes and it rises above the water sounds.  I am a senior with slightly compromised hearing, so this is saying a lot.  It's not going to rattle your bones like a good-size woofer would, but still impressive for it's size.  The Oontz quickly and easily paired with my Kindle and Mac, and I suspect it will do so with my android phone as well (haven't tried it yet).  I would buy again and recommend.👍",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0

As the night went in and alcohol flowed the music was jamming and the only think louder was when the neighbor lit his hand on fire with all the powder from the firecrackers that built up on his hands and ignited.

"Purchased this speaker to connect to my husband's laptop at work, so he could listen to Sirius XM.  After connecting to the computer, it would play for a couple minutes and go silent for a few seconds.  It did this repeatedly.  However the Sirius XM would play non-stop on the computer's internal speakers.  Also tried it on my laptop, same problem.  In both situations, the speaker was sitting on the desk beside the laptop.  In addition, the volume was disappointing.  I was hoping it would be loud enough to play in a small, 2 person workshop, but not enough volume.  However, it was inexpensive, so I plan to keep it to see if I find a use for it; maybe I'll use it with my phone.",3,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"1st, if you want a really good laugh go to the customer questions about this speaker. The first question asks, ""what are the ingredients?"" Read on as many contribute to the hilarious answers.2nd, this little speaker is one of the best deals I believe I've found on Amazon. I like my music ... and I like it LOUD! Not just loud but good sound quailty still at loud volume! This little guy does the trick, and trips my trigger. No noise distortion or to loud on treble or base when volumes up. It stays clear. Pondering buying a second one for stero effect. Also at this price they're a steal for gifts. Looking at cases for this as it is small enough to throw in hand bag or beach bag or take to work. Caught my 19 yr old running off with my new speaker already, so yea, don't hesitate to keep yours safe and get them one of their own. Lol",5,1,2017-9-19,1,1,0
This worked great for 3-4 months but now it won't hold a battery charge at all. I leave it on charge overnight then when I turn it on next day it comes on for 1-2 seconds then goes off again. It won't connect to any devices for more than a couple of seconds either. The build quality is fine (I don't really like the rubberized parts and they attract dust like crazy) and the sound quality is excellent. Pity about the terrible battery/electronics.,1,1,2019-1-29,1,2,0
"Works fine for my purposes - getting some music into my workshop or in the pop-up trailer from download Spotify tunes on my phone. A small irritation is that there’s no indication of a full charge when plugged into a charger. Uses the same mini-usb charger as my Samsung phone, but even if left charging overnight the red light doesn’t change. Would be nice if we could tell when the battery is fully charged. Probably not powerful enough for a party to supply dance music, but I don’t use it for that anyway.",3,1,2019-9-8,1,1,0
"I have purchased  2 of these now.  After about a month of use the USB input port gets trashed, and the cord no longer fits correctly.  I thought the first one was a fluke.  Then the 2nd one did the same thing.  Too bad too, because it's a GREAT little speaker.  But ANYTHING with micro usb connector is now out for me.

This is my 2nd one. They sound great at first but one was a gift that stopped putting out clear sound just outside the 90 day warranty period and was worthless. I purchased this 2nd one in January 2019 to replace the one that stopped working.....guess what? This 2nd Oontz also stopped producing clear sound and is now worthless.  I will never purchase any Oontz product ever again. The warranty is only 90 days for a reason! Look elsewhere.,1,1,2019-9-29,1,1,0
"I bought this speaker because I am a portrait photographer.  Often is hard to pose couples and get them a loving and intimate poses if the atmosphere is not right.  This speaker was the right fit.  Now while carrying my bag I use a velcro scrap to hold my speaker and pandora as my music source and the results are awesome.  This speaker is loud, if turned up too loud it get attention of those more than 100 yards away.  I get the volume at a comfortable level and this  Oontz Angle 3 delivers.  It is a must have.  I have used in the rain, but I am not saying it is waterproof but I am saying it is water resisitant.  It performs flawlessly.  Its a highly recommend on my list.  The only thing I could ask for is a small hook that I could hand it from my bag other than the velcro straps that I use.  But I would by it over again if I had to.  This Oontz is a winner for me as a photographer.",5,1,2018-9-28,1,0,0
"Wow, what an upgrade for my Fire HD-8. I just rcv'd the OontZ Angle3 portable bluetooth speaker box by Cambridge Soundworks. Arrived asestimated in 2 days.  Very sturdy device, good looking, protected and functional controls for vol, on/off, and BluTooth pairing.  It paired with my 6 month old Fire HD-8 beautifully.  Now when I listen to Audible books, the sound is clear, full-bodied, and can be turned up loud to fill a whole room, or easy listening while driving a car.  Two cables were  include; a 10"" USB cable for charging from a computer or a charger plug like the one for my Fire tablet, and a 24"" stereo cable for connecting practically any device to this speaker.  There are 2 speakers inside the OontZ, and they sound terrific for the small portable size of this device.  The manual claims around 7hrs listening time on one charge. A brand  name company is producing a great product that dramatically enhances the listening experience for under $30. This added spice to life is well  worth it!  6/22/2017",5,1,2017-6-22,1,1,0

"Honestly when I bought this I half expected to be disappointed. But I'm actually impressed. So it gets here on time, I pull it out, and the instructions said it came with a partially charged battery so you can try it out right away. I really like that, and I have been using it for HOURS now and the battery is still going. Going on 7 hours now, I'm impressed. As for the sound, I'm also pleasantly surprised with that. Honestly I could go for a little more bass (maybe just me) but the bass is definitely decent and it doesn't distort other sounds even if I play a bass boosted song with maxed volume. Overall, 10/10, would recommend this and if this one ever fails me (assuming it lasts long enough, still day 1 here) I fully intend to buy it again. Hell, I might just buy an extra as a back up in case I go to the river or something for a day. Good price, great quality.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"Pleasantly surprised with this speaker.  I owndd 3-4 other Bluetooth speakers and this one performs pretty darn well for the price.  It’s not a big speaker so don’t expect media room sound quality. I haven’t charged mine in two weeks so I can’t complain about the battery life but I also don’t leave mine on gor more than 15-20 minutes at a time.I use mine in the shower (back edge, not directly near water) and the sound quality and volume is enjoyable.

"As someone who is coming very late to the wireless speaker game, I have always been somewhat intimidated about how all of this Bluetooth technology works. So when I came across this very cute speaker and all of the positive reviews, I thought it would be a good way to make my introduction to the use of Bluetooth speakers and I was right.  It was super easy to connect the speaker to my phone and it easily fits in all of my bags for easy transport. It will be perfect at the beach and pool given its size and water resistance.  The volume is not as high as I would like as the speaker only plays from one side of the unit so it is difficult to clearly hear music while in the shower, and sound quality is somewhat transistor-like.  Overall, however, I am very pleased with this purchase as a first-time Bluetooth user.",4,1,2017-12-26,1,1,0
"I've had this speaker now for 8 months.  I really love it. The sound is amazingly great considering the size and in my living room/dining room combo, it's quite loud - I never run it at full volume. It's small enough to easily take to meetings or places where I want to share an audio lesson.  Angle 3 has worked quite well with my  Echo Dot 2nd gen.  Even though it says it  works with Windows 10, I have Windows 7 Home Premium and it connected and functioned quite easily.  I also  have success with my Samsung Mega smart phone.After a while of not using it, when I started up it connected to Dot, the last device I had used it with,  but then it lost connectivity and Dot could not find it again. My phone also didn't see it in a scan, however my Windows 7 laptop did - go figure.  Anyway I wrote late at night, and the next morning had an email back from support with instructions on how to reset my Angle 3 and it is now visible to all my devices again.",5,1,2018-7-31,1,0,0
"Just came in today, and I like it so far! It gets quite loud, has a pretty decent weight, but it doesn't have a lot of bass. The sound is crisp and clear, doesn't sound muffled at all.

"My speaker hasn't had any dealings with water, so I can't speak to that.  However, this speaker is VERY loud and has decent bass.  The bass does make the speaker ""walk"" if you will, so it'll probably fall off your countertop if you set it down flat.  But if you stand it on its side, you won't have this problem (or any bass).  I don't really care about bass, and if I did I'd just put the speaker some place where it won't fall.I noticed a common complaint among new purchasers was that the power button is so hard to find.  But the thing is, once you know where it is, it's not hard at all.  I don't even look for it visually.  I just pick it up and my hand finds the button.  It's easy.",5,1,2016-10-23,1,1,0
"Would not order! Product seems to be defective and will not charge. I ordered the item May 19 and it arrived on the 24th. I charged and used it within the week and was pleased with the sound quality for the price. I used a second a time also on the first charge, but when I went to use again, the blue tooth measured the charge was only 10%, so I put on the charger. The charging light never changed from red. I have tried different plug ins as it only comes with the cord and still the speaker will not recharge. When I went in to contact the seller on June 25th, it was 1 day over the 30 day delivered date. I have emailed seller with no response. Very disappointed with a useless speaker",1,1,2020-6-28,1,0,1

"Really nice little BT speaker. Using it as a desktop computer speaker. Sound is great for low normal volumes (regular everyday computer work). Really like the triangle shape so the speakers actually face me at my desk. I also like how there's no auditory indicator sounds. My previous BT speaker would always yell, ""Low battery"", ""Power On"", Power Off"", ""Connected"", etc. and it was so annoying. Another reason why I prefer this instead of others are that it has an auto shut off after 15 min of no use.Using it daily, even for gaming (when I don't want to wear a headset), I don't usually have to recharge it for 3 days. It also takes about 4-5 hours to fully charge the battery. There are definitely better $20-$30 BT speakers on the market (such as the Tribit XSound Go), but for my basic needs it works.",3,1,2018-9-10,1,0,0
"The first thing I noticed was how small this thing is. Even so, I have heard some amazing sound from some small bluetooth speakers. So I was intrigued in setting it up and hearing it.

I happened to get this at an Amazon discount price of $20, instead of the ""usual"" price of $40.Bottom line - for $20, I guess it's OK. Actually, it's not. It's crap. - it's just $20 worth of crap instead of $40. At regular price of $40, this thing would have been on its way back to Amazon the same day I received it.",2,1,2018-8-27,1,1,0
I got these before I went on vacation so we can play music on the beach. I’ve had 2 of them for about 5 months now and they’re amazing!! I am not huge into music but I can tell the difference between good and bad speakers and this one is the real deal! Super affordable with really good sound quality and even better volume!!! Also connecting two of them is very simple. The instructions were very basic but that’s all that was need (“push the button”). There isn’t any lag between the speakers and you basically just double the volume. I’m a big fan of these speakers and am glad I found them!Also I skipped the waterproof star rating because I’ve never actually had this in/around water besides a couple of drops here and there so I can’t accurately comment on its durability when water is involved.,5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0

"Wow, does my wife like this. She liked the Bose Bluetooth speaker our neighbor bought and wanted me to get her one. While I was pricing that on Amazon, I saw this highly rated speaker could be delivered for $100 less and asked if she was willing to take a gamble. She was, and we're glad we got this one: she has been using it pretty much nonstop since it arrived. Essentially the same quality as our neighbor's speaker (neighbor has declined my offer of a blind comparison) at $100 less. Very easy to pair with devices (unlike an earlier Bluetooth speaker I bought - I still use that one in the office, but my wife is not a fan) and the sound is great. Convenient to move around and has held a charge as long as we've needed it to do so (she charges it at night). Handy to use outside as it shrugs off light rain and occasional splashes from the pool. Sometimes technology really comes through with a great, inexpensive product - this is one right here.",5,1,2017-7-29,1,1,0
"For such a compact and inexpensive Bluetooth Speaker I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and volume. No it's not concert hall quality sound but it's good enough for me. I was expecting a tinier sound, not the full sound that it produces. Connecting to it was quick and simple through Bluetooth. You can also use the USB connection that you use to charge the speaker if you don't want to use Bluetooth. I do have one (sort of) complaint. All controls are under a black rubber cover and while this works well and the controls have raised indicators, they are very difficult to see. A small thing but I still find it a little irritating if I'm trying to visually locate them. On the other hand, I'm sure I will memorize their location quickly, especially since I will mainly use the volume control and it is at the bottom of the left side. There is a sticker that shows the location of the power button on the front upper left side but when I take the sticker off it will be invisible. On the other hand, the difficulty seeing the buttons gives the speaker a clean look so there is a pro to this complaint.",5,1,2018-2-8,1,0,0
"No Jbl or Bose speaker but the price was right and had high reviews.  Quality about the same as cheap headphone speakers out of the past.  Not much base although the sound is clear.  Still working on adjusting base.  Works better than old portable radio and I am not locked into commercial radio.  Bluetooth distance not great if a wall is in the way but works in open area.  Still exploring best location to link when not in the computer room.  Not sure I would purchase again but not returning it either.  You pay for what you get, a basic working speaker.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0

"It's extremely hard to pair, first of all.  But the main issue is that mine just.... got quiet.  I looked up online, they say charge the battery.  It's charged.  The volume will not go up.  Used a wall outlet, everything.  Do yourself a favor and look at the ""frequently asked questions"" part of the oontz website.  Seems to be a hundred different issues that people frequently ask about.  I'm amazed that in 2019 people can advertise, and sell a product that doesn't work.  This is completely unacceptable.

I'm a latecomer to bluetooth technology. The tiny 11 year old speakers I used with my old MP3 player were tearing at the surrounds and being tied to an electric  outlet for the transformer and another cord to the laptop really constricted it's use. I have used products from Cambridge Sound Works in the past and have always been impressed by their quality. This speaker met and exceeded all my expectations. The one down side as noted by others was not being able to see the controls in the dark housing. A little bit of enamel paint applied to the raised symbols using a toothpick easily and quickly solved that problem for me.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,1

"I kept doubting that such a small speaker would have much punch, but I trusted the expert reviewers here, and they didn't lead me astray. When I demonstrated the volume limits to my husband it actually made my ears ring for the next hour because the speaker got so loud! The treble is clean and the bass rich. I'm dating myself, but I had a component stereo for some years that had speakers that were probably 3 feet high, so it still seems like some kind of technological miracle that such good sound could be packed into just a few inches. It's true, this little speaker doesn't have such a full and loud sound as those giant speakers, but if I want home theater sound I'll use my high-end speakers for that. This is the perfect alternative to a personal listening device like a boom box.The bluetooth is supposed to keep a signal for 30 feet, but when I walked through my whole house, upstairs and down, there was only one spot where the signal got a little spotty maybe 40 feet away. Now that I use my phone or computer to stream a lot of music, this is such a great way to listen to it the right way instead of on those tiny, tinny device speakers. Highly recommended.",5,1,2016-12-7,1,1,0
"First and foremost, this little thing gets LOUD for its size. The other edge to that sword is that because it's small, it doesn't deliver as full of a mid range as larger speakers (example: Creative D100 or equivalent). This thing is perfect for desks, kitchens, bathrooms or tableside listening of any kind. The entire bottom side of the device is a passive subwoofer, and it does wonders when put against a reverberating surface such as a countertop or against a wall; it magnifies the sound immensely. Because of she shape, you can wedge it perfectly between the wall and towel rack while showering, and you've essentially got a mini hi-fi system in your bathroom. Bonus points if you have a drum kit - put this speaker on the floor tom and stand back in amazement.This is comparable in price to things like the small 808 CANZ and the Anker Soundcore Mini, but this thing boasts true stereo sound over those speakers being single mono drivers. If you can adjust the EQ on the device beaming to this speaker (read: turn town the treble a bit), you can turn it into a perfect replacement for larger options, and the built-in battery has so far lasted me over eight hours of play at a decent volume. Basically I watched movies on my laptop all night, woke up and it was still playing.",5,1,2017-8-16,1,1,0
"I love this thing. Very compact, but very powerful for its size. I use this when I am outside sitting around the fire pit, and it is loud.  My daughter has basically claimed this thing, and I may need to order another one. It was left outside overnight in a very light sprinkle of rain (more like a slight misting) and woke up to dew on the ground. The amount of moisture, which wasn’t much, had no effect on it. I highly recommend this. It has a long lasting battery, excellent sound, great volume and a better value than comparable speakers costing more. I have tried Altec Lansing, Bose and Anker, and I thought this one sounded much better.  Although, the Anker was a close competition.  I was steered away from that one because of connectivity and battery life issues from the one I tested.",5,1,2017-10-27,1,2,0
"I love this speaker so much! It purchased it to use in the shower for listening to the radio or podcasts or music, but without having to worry about getting anything wet. I actually wasn't really concerned with how the item sounded, given the environment in which I was going to use it. But this speaker actually surprised me at how rich it sounds, and it has quite a bit of ""presence"" in the space; that is, it doesn't sound like a tin can you may have experienced with tiny speakers in the past.It has a dedicated ""subwoofer"" port on the bottom, and the bass frequencies come out of it. This actually works best when that side is facing a wall or the floor, as it really makes the sound expand to fill the space. The side has two separate speakers, what I think of as the mids and tweeter but I don't actually know if it has 2-axial or not.",5,1,2016-10-3,1,1,0
"I loved it at first but after a few days, it couldn’t make up its mind.

I wanted to smash it with a hammer or drive my truck over it or throw it out the window on the freeway but I decided to write a review and return it for a real Bluetooth speaker, not a rip-off Chinese copy (or wherever the hell it’s from—even if it’s Taiwan 🇹🇼 its crappy as hell!!",2,1,2020-6-11,1,1,0

Easy set up and paired easily and quickly with 3 different phones (not at same time)  We also connected it, first by bluetooth and then by USB cable to an Alexa Dot so we could listen to Prime Music.  Great being able to use voice control.  Sound is strong with more than sufficient volume to fill a large room.  We also used outdoors and had no problems hearing it over traffic and construction noise. Sound quality is nice and clean with pretty good bass.  Not a Klipsch, but pretty darn good for something you can hold in one hand.  Perhaps the on/off button could be easier to spot and use.  Otherwise no significant faults especially when you consider its price and size. Would buy again and in fact we did.",5,1,2017-8-20,1,1,0

While riding on in a 7-day bike tour, the battery usually lasted for every day's worth of ride (4-6 hours) and recharged every night.  halfway through, the bungee cords I had it attached to the handlebars with came loose while cruising about 15 MPH and it took a hard tumble on an Iowa country highway.  While it had a significant scuff and yellow highway paint rubbed into the gouge, it still operated perfectly.  After that, I bought another one of these and gave it to my brother who can pair his speaker to mine so we can listen to the same music!

It was easy to connect to an iphone and use but the sound quality is  was missing bass in my classic rock type of music. There is no EQ nor app to adjust EQ. For a few dollars more it may have been worth upgrading to the Ontz Angle 3 Ultra with more power and bass. Otherwise for the price it is enjoyable and far better than the phone speakers.,3,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"My son likes to hook up a Bluetooth speaker to his iPhone to listen to music while playing the PS4. He already had one, but wanted to get a more updated speaker.This speaker charges fairly quickly, you can use it while it is charging and the volume that comes out of it is almost unbelievable. A few times I got up to go yell at him to close his door because the music was drowning out my tv. He did not have the door open.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
Like other reviews here have stated this speaker is defective right out of the box. When i received it i charged it fully used it for about 30 minutes then the next day wouldn't turn on. I go through the manual it says if it becomes fully drained use a tablet phone charger for 15 minutes and then it should power on. It didnt i got a total of maybe 30 minutes use out of it. It sounded great but again completle paper weight after that1 star very disappointed,1,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
I live in an old house with thick stone walls which make wireless tech hard work. To get sound out and down one floor to our deck I ran a 20 foot USB 3.0 extension cable from a Windows 10 machine and plugged a Bluetooth adapter into it. My Angle 3 now plays music from the media storage. Ace!Seems great value for money. 5-stars for the device and ease of set-up. 4-stars for the music quality: it's good for its size but you can't beat physics. It would be nice to have the option to overdrive the speakers and accept distortion if that's your thing.,5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"I love music and, for some reason, Spotify stopped working on my Firestick so I couldn't listen on my TV. I received it today and I have to say I am absolutely happy with how loud it got. My animals, however, didn't take kindly to me turning EXO's Obsession all the way up to test how loud it got and the quality. They were asleep. The cat jumped off the bed and my German Shepherd went into police dog mode.  The laugh I got was worth the purchase alone. Thanks for this. I can now work and work out on my elliptical like I used to do (when Spotify worked on the Firestick).",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"This product hardly needs my review, but oh well.  It was smaller than I expected, but has big sound. Much much better than my 21"" TV speakers! I highly recommend getting something like this for under-40"" TVs when you can't afford a sound bar. Pair with a transmitter and get an adapter that has red-and-white male ends and combines them to a female 3.5mm end.  Plug a bluetooth transmitter to that and viola! Remote speaker for little money. Set this little guy on the table or couch arm beside you.My TV sound doesn't cut off when this is used; I set it on mute, and this speaker's loudness is controlled entirely by the up-down volume buttons here--which you want. Take it with you when you go to the bathroom during a show, step into the kitchen, etc.",5,1,2016-10-8,1,1,0

"Got this for Father’s Day and have since used it at the pool several times.  Reasonably good sound for such a small package— even bass response.  Plenty loud enough even outdoors and covering a large area with sound.  We charged it fully when it arrived and have used it for at least 10 to 12 hours over the past weeks with no additional charge needed— still going strong.  Bluetooth works great, staying connected even when I carried my phone quite a distance and into the club house restroom.  We’re happy with the purchase and feel like it’s a great value for the price.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"How can you not love a tiny little speaker with the guts to call itself ""Oontz""?This little sucker delivers a very ambient, very present quality to music wirelessly. Not overwhelmingly loud enough to distort the music, but certainly loud enough to appreciate ""your jam""--that is, it can be pretty darn loud, but it doesn't garble and hurt the music when it's turned up.",5,1,2016-8-17,1,1,0

"4.5 Stars. I bought a couple of these speakers  to connect to a TV. I really want to give this product five stars because of how easy it was to get a replacement for 1 that simply had a light that didn't work. Regarding the sound quality, for the size and the price it does a great job. Occasionally while watching a movie or show the sound quality will change. To be fair there are times that the shows could be trying to use surround sound teachers that are not supported by the Bluetooth. I have set two of these up next to me on the furniture and kept the volume fairly low. You can turn up the volume and set the speakers7 to 10  feet away pretty easily, but this is going to kill your battery faster and the battery life was the other slight ding. These will easily get you through a movie. But if you're going to Lounge and Binge then simply plug these in. Double check the dimensions so you realize the smallness of these. I plan on expanding the speaker system to include a decent sound bar in the front turning these into side or back corner speakers. Totally worth the money invested.",4,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0

"Just received this speaker today, it is just what I was looking for.  I previously reviewed the URPOWER speaker, the one with the LED lights, saying it was not what I was hoping for as the sound was not up the level I wanted.  This little speaker costs only about $7 more than the URPOWER and the sound is significantly better....so THIS is what I was looking for.  Very small and lightweight for travel, yet sound is much better quality, both on the highs and lows.  I did not return the URPOWER (which I should have), but it's too late now.  So I compared the 2 by playing the same song on both speakers.......trust me and spend the extra 7 dollars.  Speaker really feels like a quality product, well made, instructions not written in China.  Well worth the money....it's not a Bose but it also does not cost $200.  I spent a lot of time reading review on Amazon before making this purchase and looks like I made the right choice.",5,1,2017-8-11,1,1,0
"We had a DKnight magicbox for 9 months and a magicbox II for 6 months and they both stopped working in the same week.  Found this OontZ Angle 3 with so many wonderful reviews, and it costs less also.  We really love it!  The sound is so much better -  great and full, and it is also louder. The fact that it is water resistant, and Cambridge tells me it will be fine left on a covered porch - so no rust to worry about - makes it perfect for our screened porch, our very favorite place.  I think the Cambridge company is a well established, well respected company and I am very pleased.  I will probably be giving these as gifts in the future!  UPDATE: over a year later ( Ocotober 13 2017) it is still going strong and holds a charge for a long time!  The sound is still really great for such a small speaker!!!!

Now, when it was working it was very loud for such a small speaker. i loved it. i carried it everywhere with me. lightweight, portable, and loud all the things i look for in a bluetooth speaker.

"Wonderfully crafted speaker that not only sounds amazing, but is strong and durable. Let me just say that people in my household tend to ""borrow"" the items of mine that they seem to like. And more often those said items are dropped, stepped on, or who knows have what happen to them. This speaker has stood up to the test. It has been kicked while left charging on the ground, stepped on, dropped from the upstairs step railing, you named it. It has yet to lose its amazing sound quality and functionality.  I have had zero issues with connectivity to my phone, wirelessly to my tv, and the various other tablets and phones throughout the household. This is only a 10w speaker, but the volume level without distortion and bass quality are impressive.  I highly recommend anyone to pick an OontZ Angle speaker up. Or maybe a few since people will want to borrow it from time to time.",5,1,2018-7-4,1,0,0
"I bought this to use in my office while at work where I connect it directly to an auxiliary cable. I first noticed a constant static noise while music was playing which occurred while both plugged in and when playing via bluetooth. I'm guessing this speaker does better when you're outside and have the volume turned up higher. When trying to play this in my office the sound was either way too quiet, or way too loud. I noticed the highs were very high and I could barely hear the lows in the music I played. From what I heard, not a good range at all. Looking at how many reviews this product had, I figured it would be a good purchase, but I am definitely not happy and have already purchased another speaker.",1,1,2019-10-25,1,1,0
"Just what I wanted. I don't have an input into my old truck's audio system, so I wanted this speaker to listen to Audible and podcasts while I am driving. It works well for that application. I use it for music too and it's fine. Musically, it won't probably satisfy an audiophile, but it's good enough for that average not-to-particular listener who doesn't overthink things, especially considering the price. I would definitely buy this again.Update: I somehow lost my speaker when I took it to work. I DID by it again. The replacement didn't work. Could not turn it on. Customer service via email was superb. They replaced the speaker with a new one that works fine. I was to return the old one, but they forgot to include the return label, so they said to keep or discard the faulty item. Very pleased with the company.",5,1,2018-9-25,1,0,0
"This is just a first impression. I bought this for work so I will update once I use it at beginning of week. Impression is this speaker is smaller than I thought, I hope it sounds better than the size. Looks wise it's pretty cool. Stay tunedOk so here is the update: the sound matches the size. I work in a small section of a warehouse type area and by no means am I trying to get the building to hear music but I have to turn the volume almost up to get it to sound loud enough to be pleased. I will say this is more of an office/cubicle speaker and should be advertised as such.",2,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
I love this thing. It blows my cheaper blue tooth USB speaker put of the water. You can’t even hear that one at max volume with this on at 80%. I can hear it clearly while showering or the bath running and the bathroom fan on.The sound fills a room very well. It feels like a very quality build and it’s super ergonomic. I’ve been carrying it around everywhere like a weirdo. The anti-skid strips allow it to be placed on slighktly angled surfaces without falling down.,5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I was very hesitant to buy a BT speaker. I've heard a bunch of them and have not been impressed at all to say the least. Then I bought a phone with a weak speaker and that just doesn't fly with me, so I researched a bunch and ordered this one. Let me tell you, I'm really impressed with the clarity of the sound. It's no hi-fi, but the low-mid-high balance is impressive. It pushes plenty of volume and it the amount of bass produced is perfect; it's enough to give the sound depth without overpowering the mids and highs. I use this as my audio output when I teach CPR classes and it's plenty loud and clear for the classes.",5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"Note, I am not someone who knows what a subwoofer is, or what speakers are the sh*zit.

I am able to leave my phone in 1 spot in my apartment and carry this thing around as I clean/organize from room to room without disrupting the musical flow/soundtrack to my life. I use in the bathroom while I sing in the shower.",5,1,2016-11-6,1,1,0
"I mostly use this to listen to music outside. Loud and clear, with no distortion--even louder than our home stereo system. Relatively lightweight and fits in a pocket, so it's easily portable (as an 80's child, I thank you!) The louder, the less bass, but I think that's to be expected, all things considered, and it never sounds overly ""tinny,"" regardless.

"I nearly bought some $130 Bose speakers when I saw these and had to try them. So far I've been very impressed. Between the device volume and the speakers volume, there's an enormous range, to the extent that I can watch whatever I want when my roommate is asleep and also have awesome dance parties when she's gone. The aux cord and bluetooth features both work great, although it is meant to be stationary while in use. If I move my phone around a lot when it's connected via bluetooth, it sometimes cuts out, but it's not enough to be a problem. I leave my speakers plugged in most of the time, and haven't noticed any negative effects to the battery when I take it off the charger.All in all, the speaker sounds good and has an enormous volume range, and I have been very pleased with it.",5,1,2017-2-28,1,1,0

Setup works very well, my phone has bluetooth so don't need the adapter for that or laptop but did need it for the DVD player. Speaker are Nice!

Now, less than 2 months after the new purchase, the same thing happened.  The speaker overheats when charging, and won't turn off.  I unplugged it and stayed hot for a very long time- then died.

It worked ok but the volume and quality was lacking. This little thing fixed that!!!  It’s small enough to set in the cup holder and it’s more than loud enough. Sound quality is surprisingly good for its price and size. Build quality seems solid enough.EDITED: One year and this thing is still going strong. A couple of months after I got I also got a brand new Freightliner with Bluetooth at work to drive.

I had no problems connecting to my iPad. Just basically turned it on an followed the directions that came with it.  I really like the fact that it is water proof.. not that you can take it swimming or anything but lot of times while I'm using it I'm cleaning and doing my dishes and my hands are wet.... so when I turn it up or down I  don't have to worry about hurting it in anyway by getting it wet.

Sounds quality is same as my excellent Anker speaker but once plugged in the Oontz bluetooth radio stays on.  This means that you just need to switch on your source, Pandora for example, your phone will find, pair with Oontz and start playing.  No buttons to press and hold , for who knows how long? on the speaker.  This to me is a great convenience.  To operate my Anker I have to go to the speaker, press and hold the power button for 1? second  3? seconds, to get the chime sound and connect with the phone.

"I purchased this speaker when the JAM finally croaked.  The price was right and the reviews were great, but I ended up returning it because of SLEEP MODE.  I use this speaker in my office at work.  When I'd come in in the morning, I'd have to switch the unit on/off so it would connect to my phone (which was better than having to go to the Bluetooth settings on my phone to connect like I did with the JAM speaker).  The sound was good - but not great.  But then, after lunch, it would go to ""sleep"" after less than an hour.  I'd have to switch the unit off/on once again to start playing my music again.  It sounds like such a little inconvenience, but switching the speaker off/on twice a day on a unit that is, in my opinion, mediocre wasn't making me happy.

They explained sometimes the speakers can be damaged during shipping. We’ve been using the replacement speaker for several months since and have had no problems with it. It’s actually much louder than the Soundcore 2 I had purchased for myself. His sister is constantly composing she can here his music thumping from all the way down the hall.

It's unfortunate because it appears to be a nice speaker and it's offered in a variety of colors at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, we received a used one. The seller did honor my refund request.Update: I took a chance to order another speaker, hoping that the second one would be new, as described.

The sound is clear.  The volume is very respectable.  It is small enough that it doesn't take an enormous amount of counter space next to the sink.  And while I haven't used it a ton of hours (20-30 minutes a day, every day for about 20 days), I am still working off of the charge that was on the speaker when it was delivered.

Yes it will be loud enough not to HAVE to play at 100%.  Listening to Keane at 29 and its loud enough not to have the neighbors complain.  Prior to this I would play the laptop speakers at 100% and it wasn't as good.  I recommend!!  with my  Whole Heart!!!

I bought these to bring with me to my families camp on Lake Ontario- a very wavy and loud body of water haha- We had no issues hearing the music over lots of family and the water. One of the best tips I had read in a review before purchasing was that the base was sometimes too much for some song (for some people... I liked it haha)- To fix this the speakers can be placed vertically instead of flat down like intended. It cuts the base down perfectly but doesn't hurt the sound at all.

"Great bluetooth speaker. Received it July 21st, fully charged it up, have used it steadily every day since.  It hasn't needed a charge yet!  That's impressive.  It's nicely shaped so you can grab it and move it to wherever you need it to be.  We've used ours indoors and out.  We've paired it with an iPad, iPod touch, Galaxy S6 and a Nexus 10.  It works great with them all.  It puts out decent sound considering it's size.  The shape of the housing does add some needed bass tone and depending on the surface it's sitting on, the bass varies.  A wood coffee table and a wood dresser produced pretty good sound quality.  Outside in the open air, sitting on a plastic deck table, the bass was lost.Overall, a really good product for the money.",5,1,2017-8-7,1,2,0
"Was looking for an inexpensive bluetooth speaker for the bathroom to be on the counter for when I am getting ready or showering.  I didn't want to worry about if it got splashed with water, etc.  This is a nice little boom box with pretty impressive sound for how small it is.  It might also be amplified because it is in my bathroom (it might not be so loud outside), but I am happy with it.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,1,0
"Update Oct. 20,16--------3 months to the day, unit stopped playing on the last day of 90 day warranty. Nervous if they will give me a hard time. Contacted customer service on the weekend got a response right away asking for my Amazon purchase number. 2nd message they were sending me a replacement. Fantastic, very happy. Got the replacement within a week. Tested it. Played, but with distortion now at higher phone volumes.  Well at least it works. Red battery light starts blinking, ""o yea got to charge it up"". Plug in the little black microUSB cord that came with(nice touch) to a Samsung 7 USB charger. 6 hours later it has stopped blinking and grab it to go for sound outside. Won't turn on. ""What?"", this is how the old one acted after 3 months now it's happening right away. Try different things then plug it in and light goes on and unit powers up and plays music. Disconnect power and nothing. Ugh! I'll update after I hear back from Oontz though they threatened me that only one replacement under warranty. I'll see.",2,1,2016-7-17,1,1,0
"Today this device abruptly stopped working. Purchased it on 1 July 2019 and it worked great, with no major complaints. It paired very well with my mobile, computer and android mini projector. The battery life was not bad - battery time can be prolonged if it’s used on low volume in a small space eg bathroom. On high volume, it would last a continuous 3.5 hours tops on full charge. I’m not sure why it was so short lived. I really liked this device and would purchase it again if I could.",3,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0

I contacted Oontz customer support and got a response within minutes. They offered their apologies, asked for my order number from Amazon. After I provided this info, they said while my purchase was out of the 30 day return window to return through Amazon, the item was still considered to be under product warranty and I could either package the item and pay return shipping and they’d mail me a new one, or I could just pay $7.99 flat rate shipping and they’d send me a brand new one!

"I just got this thing a couple of days ago.  I have been using it all day long every day since it arrived.  What I have used it for is the Kindle Fire 10 HD.  The Bluetooth works great and gives me a better sound and I can carry it all over the house and even into the garage and it still gets the signal.  I can't go around too many corners and at distance I have to set it down so it is broad side to the signal, but it is surprising that it works so well.  This allows me to leave the Fire 10 plugged in and the battery of the speaker seems to last for most of the day until I can set it close to the Fire 10 and plug in the charging cable.  There is a also a cable with micro speaker plugs at both ends that also works great with the Fire 10, but I just checked to see that it worked and haven't otherwise used it because the Bluetooth works so well.  It also seems like it is pretty well made and is likely pretty rugged.  It looks to be waterproof with the rubber tab sealed but I sure wasn't going to check that!",5,1,2017-10-22,1,0,0

"My expectations of a bluetooth speaker of this price range was pretty low to be honest.  I must say I'm actually impressed with it so far.  I originally bought it use in the bathroom while taking a shower in the mornings.  Links up to my phone in no time.  It's loud and clear enough to be heard over the sound of water in the shower while sitting by the sink across the bathroom.  Perfect for what I bought it for.  The kicker is, I actually use it with my laptop now too.  It's a great little speaker for editing video to when I don't want to wear headphones.  Bravo to OontZ.  Now we see how long it lasts.  I'll report back if I have any issues.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"No fuss pairing, even with dual channel (2 speakers), great sound, good build quality with a durable, waterproof housing. We use these speakers every day on sail/snorkel charters in the Caribbean, and they fill the boat with great sound while standing up formidably to sun, weather, even salt water. I only wish they had a battery level indicator. We never know whether or not they need a charge (because the battery lasts so long we forget when we charged them last) so every now and then they surprise us by suddenly dying. More frequent charging is the obvious easy solution.Highly recommended!",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I purchased this to replace a pair of Bose desktop speakers that died - they fell off the table one too many times.  I wanted something smaller to give me more desk space and less wires.  I am using a 3mm stereo cable with my desktop PC, but I also wanted something that performs multiple tasks, such as, using blue tooth with my cell phone, which it paired with in a matter of seconds.  It is small enough to take anywhere and is ""rubberized"" on the ends.  I knew someone (past tense), who had a JAM XT Extreme, which I think, had slightly better sound - not as much base, same price tier. That was several months ago, so I can't perform a current, side by side, comparison. The JAM XT also comes with a carabiner clip to hang it anywhere; you would be surprised how handy that is at times...  But, it is not as cute as the OontZ.",4,1,2017-6-23,1,1,0
BT connectivity is great for iPhone and Samsung phones. Sounds great.  The port for the power cord is terrible though. It is weak and becomes deformed after the slightest pressure of the power adapter when it is plugged into the speaker. After this occurs the power cord will not stay plugged into the speaker's port. The power adapter easily falls out of the port after you remove your hand.  So it becomes really hard to keep it plugged into the charger.  This has happened to me on two of these speakers after about three months of use.  I wish they didn't use the micro USB port for the power source.,2,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker because it had so many 5-star reviews, but unfortunately, it hasn't worked as well for me. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the bluetooth connectivity or the general sound quality, but whenever I'm playing music from it, the sound will periodically short out. If I move my phone (that I'm playing the music from), it will generally come back but then mess up again. After trying it for about a month, I've decided to return it.",2,1,2019-6-1,1,1,0
"This is an excellent inexpensive speaker. I purchased this while on vacation at the beach because I forgot to bring my (old) Bose Soundlink Mini. It has a lot of good reviews and a few duds. At $21 (with coupon), I expected a a speaker that may sound as good as an Echo Dot at best. I was surprised that it exceeded my expectations. The build quality and materials are very good. Bluetooth pairing is no more difficult than pairing with most devices. I have paired it with my iPhone 8 & Echo Dot. The sound quality is very good for an inexpensive speaker--it is not going to replace my Soundlink Mini. It could play plenty loud at the the beach and stayed connected with my phone for the entire day.I have it paired with my Echo Dot at home an use it every morning to listen to the news in the shower--nice that it's water resistant.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0

"I am really loving this little speaker!! It is exactly what I was wanting; a not-too-bulky, yet powerful sounding Bluetooth speaker for my kitchen.  It sounds great and doesn't take up much space at all. I recommend it to anyone.Update (December 5, 2018)-Well, I noticed a few days ago that the red light indicating that it was charging was not coming on anymore. I thought there was a problem with the charger that I was using, but I tested the charger with other devices in my home and even tested the outlet in the wall. Neither was the problem. Today the speaker, completely conked out and it will not charge.  No damage was done to my speaker, I haven't dropped it or dropped it in water or anything.  It just stopped after 9 months!! It's a shame because I really, really liked this speaker.  I jammed my variety of music all over my house.  It sounded better than my tv soundbar.  Oh well. :(",3,1,2018-3-10,1,0,0
"I bought this one in orange to replace a lost Oontz Angle 3 Plus which is no longer made (but, oddly, still available at walmart.com). I was thrilled that I could get it in a bright color because I lose things that are all black (like the Plus). However, the sound is much thinner than the Plus and the color is only on the front, not all the way around. To get any stereo effect it has to be no farther than 5 inches from my head.To get better sound quality I will have to go to the Ultra which can be ordered in white. Not orange, but still less likely to get lost. theoontz.com has a $10 discount on white with free shipping and no tax in MD as of April 18, 2020.",4,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0

I may just have a bad one but man - it sucks.  I leave it charge for days and when I want to use it, I find out it wasn’t perfectly plugged.

Never went past 50 feet, so not sure about the 100 feet range as listed in the specifications. Played tunes throughout the day and night with no recharge.

"UPDATE: Great while they last. The micro USB charging port on both my Oontz speakers failed within a week of each other, rendering them useless. The charging jack is a shoddy design. Seriously disappointed as I love my Oontz speakers. Great service from Cambridge while in warranty, but once they’re out of warranty, they fail due to this one simple design flaw. Close inspection of the jack shows the substandard design and construction of the jack. The rest of the unit is very well-designed and solidly constructed.I loved my speakers.

"I bought this about 3 months ago, and I've been using it daily.  I mostly use it hooked up to my laptop, because my laptop speakers aren't nearly loud enough.  It's been great for that, with much better sound quality than the various $5 speakers I'd tried before (not that I expect much for $5).  The last few days, however, I've been using it to play music from my phone.  I can't say exactly how many hours I've been using it without it being plugged in, but it's been over 10.  I just plugged it in now (since I'm about to leave for a bit and won't be using it) even though it still hadn't indicated that it had a low battery.  I'm definitely impressed! I also love the size and design.UPDATE! I like this speaker enough, I bought a second one to use at work. I resurrected an old cell phone and use it just for music, and to save on battery on both the phone and speaker, I use an audio cord rather than the Bluetooth. I leave them continuously playing during my entire shift, and have never run out of battery. I plug them both in after my shift ends. Yesterday, my shift began at 11am. I started the music immediately. I forgot to turn them off and plug them in at the end of my shift. When I opened this morning, after 24 hours of continuous play... It was still going!

"The goal was to keep this plugged into my laptop's audio and USB output, the latter so it could stay charged all the time. But when the 3.5mm audio cable is plugged in at the same time as the USB charging cable it emits continuous squelchy static, so that it's only usable if I disconnect the charging cable. This means I have to remember to charge it occasionally (and make sure the audio cable is disconnected when I do so.)

It's still connected to the Dot (confirmed in the Alexa app) and the Dot is online. I can see the Dot's light ring light up, but no sound comes from the Angle speaker (or the Dot speaker itself).

Work Excellent for what I need it for.  I am not too picky about my sound but to me it sounds great.  An audiophile might have something different to say than this layman though.  The biggest thing is the interface is a bit arcane at first.  This could have been alleviated by reading the manual most likely but my pride as an electronics guru would not let me do so until I have figured out the basics through trial and error first.

I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again, or even the bigger model.Later - Tried it a second time in a different room, and every time I turned the speaker on it connected audibly for a few seconds and then disconnected itself and would not reconnect.

"simply UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I was sick and tired of cheesy Bluetooth units that struggled to provide a full, rich sound.  The ones that ""claim"" to be able too completely destroy battery life.  This unit does a perfect balance!  The sound is AMAZING. Clear high treble and solid bass where it is needed.  Just a note, if you are a ""bass-head"" you will never find a battery-power, Bluetooth speaker of this size.  It is simple physics and not possible under size and power ratio.  The battery life is indeed 7-hours, but again physics and math folks.  7-hrs is at 50% volume.  Find a good balance between you device volume and speaker volume for optimal performance.  Bluetooth range is great again, further distance, more power need.  This unit stands up to the elements great also.  I have gotten it wet, muddy, greasy and even dropped with no issues.  Keep in mind that water ""resistant"" is not water ""proof"".  Unit survived a quick down pour, but just don't throw it into the pool;-)  Use simple logic and you will be fine. As a bonus unit has 1/8"" plug.  You can use it of any device with 1/8"" output for hard-wiring direct to speaker.  I also bought the genuine case for this.  Closing note...

I still would try to charge it but it wouldn’t hold. I’d keep it on the charger for 12+ hours and it would play for maybe 30 minutes then shut off.,1,1,2019-2-9,1,2,1
"What a pleasant surprise ~ I am floored by this great little addition. First, I want to say that I was going to buy the Symphonized speaker that could be used for bluetooth, as I have a Samsung tablet and wanted to play my lessons from it. However the reviews of the thin sound of the Symphonized had me concerned. A good percentage stated that although it was good, that there was a problem with it when cranking it up.Well, I kept looking and found several of these speakers that were better than the 3W Symphonized. However THIS speaker boasted 10W, was water resistant (not that I was going to listen to it in the shower) and it had an audio out line in case I didn't want to listen to it via Bluetooth. That got my attention because I have an audio out jack on my computer.",5,1,2016-5-29,1,1,0
"I LOVE this speaker. Before I had a problem, which I'll get to in a minute, I was impressed by how long it held it held a charge, the sound quality, the design, the fact that it's bluetooth enabled... I had tried two other smaller speakers, the kind you have to hook together and then hook to your device (annoying), and neither of them came close to the quality and design of this speaker. I didn't fully or intentionally test its water resistance, but it did get water splashed and sprayed on it a few times, and it continued working just fine.After a while, my speaker stopped holding a charge as long. This is usually due to it not being charged in a regular outlet, but being charged while connected to a computer. So if you have that problem, connect it to a wall outlet. Unfortunately, that didn't solve my problem. So I sent Cambridge SoundWorks  an email explaining what was going on. Not only did someone reply to me within a day, they explained my speaker may have been defective, and said they were sending me a new one! And they did! It arrived in  a couple of days! I really enjoyed communicating with the customer service rep as well. So, don't anticipate any problems, it's a very good product, but know if you do, it will be pleasantly rectified.",5,1,2016-9-27,1,1,0
"We bought this to take with us to the pool for parties and such.  I am surprised that it is as good as it is for the price.  The sound quality, in my opinion, is great. It is super easy to set up and use. Buttons are clear to understand as well. Speaker can handle some light splashes (if a child with a wet hand happens to reach over it) which is helpful for us. Worked great with my Moto Gs5 plus. Kept my phone with me and running around for a party while music played on the speaker. Almost forgot that it was coming from my phone's bluetooth.",5,1,2018-9-10,1,1,0
"I didn't expect much from such a small inexpensive speaker, but I was shocked when I heard it the first time. This little thing can crank the music. Sure it could get louder or have more bass, but that's going to cost you more. The sound quality is really good with little distortion at full volume. The bass could be deeper, but for the price and size, it is well within sufficient. I have used it in the bathroom while showering and it hasn't been affected by the humidity. The signal range on the speaker is pretty nice too. I can walk about 30-40 away in the house before it starts to cut out. I also haven't had any issues with battery life. I haven't had it die on me yet while using it.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"Don't expect the experience of a 9-speaker multi-channel sound system, but for its size and cost, this little speaker is dandy.  No problem connecting to my iPhone.  Directions for use clear (although I wish the manufacturers would get together on what a long vs. short press on the +/- buttons means.  On the two speakers I own, the effects are exactly opposite!).By the way, for the people who couldn't find the charge cord or the directions.... they're packed in a little separate compartment at the far end of the package.  Not too obvious, but not THAT hard to find!",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
This speaker is junk. I have had Amazon support even try to help because I am past the return and we have tried so many ways to make it work. It constantly is intermittent and breaks up and skips.

"Here's the deal.  It depends on what you are looking for.  I need a Bluetooth speaker in the morning for when I shave and shower, I listen to Sirius XM and also music in my iTunes library.  I have had a Bose Soundlink mini for the last year, the sound was pretty good but I have had constant problems with connectivity--it would connect and then disconnect.  And worst of all, the battery is basically useless now and you have to send it to Bose to replace it.  This new little Oontz Angle 3 is perfect for my needs.  The Bluetooth connects instantly and stays connected.  The sound is more than adequate.",5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0

"I bought this about 2 months ago to give to my wife as a Christmas gift and I finally got to give it to her. It was smaller than what I thought it would be but the sound is incredible. It's only about 5- 6"" long and about 3"" tall but it puts our one unbelievable sound. She loves to listen to music on her phone while studying or doing housework but with this great little speaker she no longer has to carry her phone with her because the speaker gives excellent sound at any volume. I turned this thing up as loud as it could go and the sound stayed crystal clear with no distortion. You can clearly make out each individual instrument as this speaker is so good and as a musician myself being able to evenly hear each and every instrument is what makes a good quality sound. Very eased with this speaker.",5,1,2016-12-25,1,2,0
"I truly love this speaker. I had previously purchased a more expensive ""Mini Jambox"" Bluetooth speaker and thought it was impressive. That is, until my dad purchase the Oontz Angle & we compared sound quality. I was immediately bummed that I spent a significant amount more, to have a speaker that didn't sound nearly as good, and that didn't reach the same volume range. The bass quality was also a significant difference. I quickly offered up my Mini Jambox to someone & purchased this speaker. That's a decision I'm happy I made. I'm completely impressed with how good the sound quality is for such an inexpensive, lightweight, & small speaker. It reaches quite high volumes, which is also a plus. Overall, I highly recommend this product & plan on purchasing a few as gifts.",5,1,2016-11-29,1,2,0
"I didn't use this really heavily as i'd normally plug into my sterio system...  I bought this for working in the garage.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize that it was never charging when I plugged it in until finally it would just not connect to my phone.  Evidently, when I plug it in, the light goes red, then slowly dies, then simply flashes...  it never went the ""blue"" that i've read about that it should be when it is fully charged.  Worked great as long as the battery lasted, but it pretty much came down to I effectively spent ~$1-2 per hour of music I got.",1,1,2019-3-21,1,2,0
"Wow! A lot of PUNCH for a little speaker. I was quite impressed straight out of the box at its compact size yet solid feel. I hooked it up to my Android phone using Bluetooth and set up was quick and easy. It also has a separate cable to hook up to the headphone jack. I though I might test the limits with Thievery Corporation and Massive Attack, just to see if the bass and highs were up to par...They were! It is small enough to fit in a zip lock but it does feature a rubber sleeve that protects the jack/mini usb port form dust and water. The buttons are rubber coated so this will be a camping and bbq essential. My wife even gave it a nod of approval for its incredible sound and power. Compact yet room filling, this little sound wonder would get 5 stars if it included a power bank. I highly recommend, though, if you want to spend little and get big sound!",4,1,2017-5-13,1,1,0

"I wanna know who gave this speaker anything more than one star? Zero lows, zero mids and all highs. Very thin highs at that. For the price, i knew i wasn’t getting a Bose but this speaker is seriously about as good as those little speakers that come in some greeting cards, maybe just a little bit more amped up. It’s THAT kind of quality. Yeah, it pairs and yeah, it plays music but it’s nothing you wanna actually listen to. Your phone speaker probably sounds better. Seriously. I’d skip this one.",1,1,2019-1-15,1,1,0
The speaker does what it’s supposed to and plays music. Does it do it well? No and yes...Depending on the music you listen to you can either have so much bass the speaker seems like it’s about to blow out or so little bass you might think it’s not working at all.,4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"This tiny little speaker is perfect for my needs.  I wanted something small and portable, and also water resistant, that would be loud enough so that I could listen to podcasts and/or music while I showered in the mornings.  This does the job perfectly.  It's so small I can set it on the sink right next to our shower and it's loud enough that I can easily hear it over the sound of the shower.  The quality of the sound from this little speaker is great, too.  It doesn't sound ""tinny"" or ""echoey"" at all.  An added bonus?  My kids can use it at night to listen to audiobooks.  The bluetooth connects with my iphone, ipad, and macbook without a problem.  The device will automatically sync to the last device it was connected to when it's turned on.  Hmm... what else will folks want to know.  The charging cable is a very short USB charging cable of about 10 inches, so know that you won't be able to snake a charging cable down to some far distant outlet behind a desk or something.  The directions said it would take about 6 hours to initially charge the battery, but we found that it charged completely the first time in less than two hours, which was nice.  We have to charge it about every three days when our kids use it every night to listen to their audiobooks (about two hours of use each time), so the charge lasts for about six hours (that's an estimate, though).  Hope this review was helpful.",5,1,2016-7-29,1,1,0
"A lot of power in a small package! I was surprised by how small this bluetooth speaker is! I was more surprised by the big, powerful sound it produces! It must have arrived with the volume set to max. It nearly blew our roof off! All of the speaker controls are located on the triangular plastic at the right end of the speaker. I had to use a flashlight to see the volume up/down and play/pause controls. The ports for charging (via mini USB) and using an audio cable (for devices without bluetooth) are concealed under a flap on the rear of the right end of the speaker. It is a little tricky to raise this plastic flap. If you use a tool to do this, try to choose something that will not damage the flap. I have an MP3 player with a stubborn bluetooth that refuses to pair with most of my bluetooth devices, It paired with the OontZ Angle immediately! It must be love!",5,1,2018-3-14,1,0,0
"This would be a five star unit if the buttons were easier to decipher.  Dull black on a dull black background.  It's hard to believe manufacturers still can't do buttons right.  BT range is phenomenal, sound is excellent considering the size and tiny passive radiator size, and battery life is surprising given the volume it will generate.  You just have to have good light or a good memory when you use the buttons.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,1,0
"We had a problem with a different Amazon recommended bluetooth speaker so we ordered this one. We have had zero problems with this one for months now and we have used it outside while next to the pool in AZ heat, and in the bathroom with the shower going...so it has held up through heat and humidity! The sound quality is great, the syncing is great. I don't really like the button configuration but I understand everything is coated in rubber to make it more water proof. The buttons are kind of on the side/back but you eventually get used to it (buttons aren't on top like an alarm clock or ipod dock). The charging port has a rubber flap that's kind of hard to open without long nails or a knife so I just use the charging cord usb corner to open it. Very mild complaints and for the price, you get a great product. The sound works great for us outside and inside for all music types (it even has great bass for when we listen to rap/dance music). Would buy again if needed to!",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"This is a good speaker for the price and size. It’s very easy to carry around, connects easily to your Bluetooth device, and sounds decent.

I dont understand how anyone wrote reviews claiming it produces bass. The sound is fine for light listening and we use it a lot - my teenage kids keep borrowing it for doing stuff outdoors.

"I absolutely love this thing.  I previously bought a Bluetooth speaker at Five Below because I thought they were all basically the same (unless you wanted to put down some serious money on a speaker), this couldn't be further from the truth.  The speaker from Five Below was destorted at higher volumes and would only last ~3 hours from a full charge.  This speaker has great sound even at high volumes, and the battery life is amazing.  I throw this in my truck's center console and I'll use it on a daily basis for a few hours, only needing to charge it every few weeks, and even then it charges in less than an hour.  I also haven't gotten this thing soaked to see if the waterproof aspect works, but I have had this sitting by a pool with kids splashing around and I haven't had a problem with it at all.TL;DR - Get this if you're looking for a low cost, good quality, long lasting speaker.",5,1,2016-7-3,1,2,0
"Nice design, nice seller who worked with me so that I could try two units. Neither worked for me as the volume stayed very low despite following all instructions. I now purchased a Techdoty model for just a little more money and the volume and sound quality are perfect.

He really likes it and my mom can sit on the other side of the sectional and here it great also. I really like it also ,but my jbl 3 I just love the extra bass it has.

"I had the first edition and loved it.  It lasted for years.  I started having issues connecting it so I figured I'd just get another since I only use it for sleep music, so sound quality isn't super important, and the battery life is solid.  The newer version seems to have a daily issue of connecting...there's always at least one connect and disconnect.  Once I turn the Bluetooth on and off a couple times on my phone it'll eventually connect.  It's not a deal breaker, just mostly annoying.  At $25 what can one really expect.",3,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"The first week or so, it randomly unpaired and re-paired itself with my phone. After about a week it stopped. I use it in the shower. It is the best speaker ever. It is not big. It is waterproof, i take like 45 minute showers and i have to charge it like once every 2 weeks. It automatically pairs to my phone when it is on and I turn on bluetooth on my phone. I also use it on my ipod nano. It is probably the only device I've never had problems with and I own a lot of electronics. It's audio is clear. The only downsides are 1) no track change button 2) I'm jot sure if it has a microphone but in order to use Siri or facetime or call on my iPhone, I have to turn bluetooth off, because when the speaker is connected whatever I record comes out unclear and sounds bad. But having the no track change buttons is all that bothers me.",5,1,2017-6-2,1,1,0

I haven't stress-tested the battery so far so cannot answer anything about its life. It got us at least 3 hours before our trip ended.

"Great affordable bluetooth speaker. Been using it at work holds charge very well only have to charge once if i have it at full volume for an 8hr shift. Super loud been getting asked where i purchased and the price. Paid $22 on Amazon and worth every penny. Comes with an auxiliary input, mic and android micro charger. Super loud and holds charge with crisp sound. Recommend for my every day forklift operators wanting some music. I had an 808 speaker that died on me. So i looked around for an affordable speaker and this had by far the best reviews under $30. If your looking for a speaker thats gonna be used for every day use this is the one. It has 2 internal speakers and a triangular base shape. You can place it standing, sideways, upside down or its original flat with the rubber pads facing downwards. If your looking at those expensive speakers try this one first its very affordable and you wont regret the purchase. Im thinking about making a Kydex case for on the go to hang on my backpack with some paracord. This would be great to take inside any Humvee since we dont have any music. They should upgrade the next version to come with a notch or loop to add some paracord. But besides that i have no issues and its really loud.

Well its lost somewhere in the source device. I was disappointed with the low end response, I was forgetting a very true physics law. Low end bass requires mo ing a lot of air and the tiny drivers will never be capable of this. So after I quit thinking it would rival my now stolen archer speaker, I recalibrated my scale of 1 to 5 and decided on a 3.

"My speaker had a defect (the sound cut in & out when I listened to my audiobooks) so I returned it, but my review is based on what I think of the speaker if it had not had this defect. I would actually give this speaker 2.5 stars, but you can't do half-stars & I feel most ppl have over-rated this product, so I went w/ 2 rater than 3. I read many glowing reviews, and based on that I did expect better sound quality than this puts out, but for just pure power, the 10-watts really is good and loud for such a compact speaker. I would personally describe the quality as ""acceptable"", and the power as ""impressive for the small size"".  I do like the triangle shape, I imagine it helps cut down on bulk if you travel. I did not like that the rubber used on both ends just attracts fine particles, lint, etc., and if you try to rub it clean with a dry finger, you'll just be wasting your time. I had to clean it twice with a damp cloth in just a day, but then I'm a little picky when it comes to things like that. All-in-all, this is probably a great speaker for a kid or teen, OK for an adult if you just want to jam in the shower, but for me this just fell short in the sound quality dept., which is frustrating because I don't see many small speakers such as this in a water-resistant model at 10-watts in this price range.

Ordered this as a Christmas gift to myself after my 15 year old beast of a stereo finally died. It was the best sound system I’ve ever had and I dreaded having to find something comparable that I could afford. It just arrived today and I’ve done a few small sound tests with all kinds of music on this little guy and wow! I’m truly amazed at the power coming out of such a small speaker. It doesn’t quite have the depth that my stereo did but it’s a solid contender. Doesn’t get distorted on high volume either! I’m very pleased and love that it’s small and portable.

I've had this 10 days now. I fell in love instantly! But after 2 or 3 days the bass started to crackle. It just doesn't sound good. Then around 1 week in I started having connectivity issues. It'll disconnect for no reason in the middle of a song. It'll do this a few times within the only ONE hour I have it on. Other than that the sound is great. It's very loud and portable. But the connectivity issue really bothers me because I have to go to my settings and connect it back again. It doesn't connect itself after disconnecting for no reason.Update: the bass is fine but I still have connectivity issues. It randomly disconnects itself. Doesn't even turn off. Just stops. I received an email for replacement but I accide tally deleted it. They offered to trade the speaker.,2,1,2018-10-15,1,0,1
Nice little bluetooth speaker. A bit smaller than I expected but still pretty good sound for what I plan to use it for. I wanted something to make my echo dot sound a bit better listening to music. It's fine for that.No this is not a flip or bose anything and certainly not my xtreme 2 but listening to pandora before falling asleep it's perfect. I leave it plugged in and forget about it. Nice. Would have been nice to include a power cube as cheap as the are but alas it was not included. Happy for its intended purpose and you can pump it up a bit and still sounds fine. Don't expect a lot but not bad either.,5,1,2019-5-1,1,0,0
"Perhaps it’s the best sound at this price-point, but the sound totally lacks depth. The worst problem, though, is the design. Breathe too hard and the battery connection becomes unplugged. The activation button lies next to the battery connection so pushing the button often unloosens the connection. Plus, the button is difficult to both find and push. I would have returned it if it weren’t a temporary solution.",3,1,2019-6-4,1,1,0
This speaker seems to be well made and the case is small enough to be easily packed for travel.  The problem is that the sound quality is very bad.  Bass is non existent.  As volume increases the sound quality diminishes even further.  I returned this for the above reasons.  I would recommend that you look at the Doss Traveler on Amazon for $30.  It is superior in all respects and is only slightly larger.  I purchased the Doss and am very satisfied.,1,1,2019-11-2,1,1,0
"I liked this speaker for a couple of years, but yesterday it ran out of battery and it would not charge. I googled this issue, and found several others who had problems with the speakers not charging. Today it seems to be working again. I have never subjected this speaker to any abuse, so why this issue would occur is a mystery. Bluetooth range is acceptable, sound is OK for its size and price.",2,1,2019-6-30,1,1,0
"I would have given this speaker five stars if I did not have some trouble with the Bluetooth connecting. Lile the other comments warned me, I started experiencing some issues after about a month or two. Luckily I was able to somehow fox it for now but its is still inconvenient. Especially if your phone can't connect to the Aux. Also something I noticed is that when it's connected to the aux it is not nearly as loud.  Other than those few things It's great though. I guess you get what you pay for so if you can live with those than I totally Reccommed it.",4,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
Very loud. I work as a baker and you can hear everything from music to podcasts over ovens and timers . I had several people ask me how much it was . I had people think I was talking to someone because it was so clear . You can hear the speaker from 500 ft or more . Better than a Bose speaker because we played both a Bose and my speaker and mine is louder than a Bose,5,1,2018-10-8,1,2,0
"Intention was for use in Zoom calls, unfortunately the unit shuts down every 15 mins as it can not detect it is being used.

"Bought this for my kid. Very sturdy, haven't tried to immerse it in water but when I borrowed it to use outside in the rain, it functioned properly and hasn't had any issues. Connection range seems a little shorter than I expected, about 15 meters, but I suspect that might be my old iPhone's fault. Great for carrying in a backpack or tote while riding a bicycle, so my kid isn't tempted to wear earbuds while riding. Haven't run the battery down all the way yet but it powered through 2+ hours of yard work with the volume up pretty high. Much better value than some of the more popular brands (looking at you, Sony and Beats). Sound is better than I expected from a unit this small. Very happy with this purchase, I bought another one for myself!",5,1,2017-7-18,1,1,0
"The Oontz Angle 3 is a very good speaker, especially for the price.  The speaker I use for most of my comparisons for speakers in this size is the JBL Flip3.  When comparing these two speakers side by side, the Oontz does well, holding it's own.  It can play just as loud (maybe a little louder) than the Flip3 but also comes with a little distortion when cranked up to maximum if there is a lot of bass in the music.  The bass on this speaker is there, not dominating in any way and actually a little more present if listening to the speaker not directly from the front.  I do not consider the Flip3 to be a bass heavy speaker either but it does have a noticeable amount more bass than the Oontz, resulting in a fuller, more serious sound.  I would not say the Oontz is tinny but it is a bit thinner sounding in comparison.  The Flip3 is extremely well balanced, the Oontz seems to have an emphasis on the high range and offers some really impressive clarity in that area.  I did see a lot of reviewers saying this speaker has great bass and I think this can be a bit misleading.  If you like a lot of bass, you will not find it here.  Bass is present, you can hear it (as I said before, better if listening from the side or back) but not really what I would call punchy or strong.  I don't think you will really find that in an inexpensive speaker of this size, you would probably have to go to something like a JBL Charge 2 or Bose Soundlink Mini for something close to this size with boosted bass.  One big advantage is that the Angle 3 costs only $28 on Amazon, compared to a retail of $100 for the JBL Flip3.Now to compare this speaker to other speakers in this price range, I would have to put this one at or near the top.  I have not found another $30 speaker that really compares with the Oontz Angle 3.  Most of them are tinny or hollow sounding and lack any kind of real bass at all.  Most of them just have a weird thumpiness where bass is supposed to be.  There are a few others out there I would still like to try but it can get expensive buying all of these speakers with my own money so I try to rely on YouTube videos and other reviews to lead me to purchase decent speakers.",4,1,2016-2-15,1,1,0
"Wife bought this to replace our Oontz angle 3 which got wet and quit working, this unit is smaller and this doesn't sound quite as full or detailed as the older angle 3. I would return it as I value sound quality but wife wanted the water proof feature. I would like to try two in stereo as that is an option on this unit that the older one wasn't capable of, but then I'm in the $65 price range and could just get a bigger better sounding unit altogether.",3,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
"I will start with what bothered me.  The first two times I used this Bluetooth speaker, the battery ran out after less than one hour.  After reading other reviews and the manufacturer's description, I felt something was not right.  So...I got in touch with the manufacturer of the product.  I laid out my case for him and he stated I should return it for a replacement.  Not to complicate the story too much, that was a hassle for me but I said I would.  However, the THIRD DAY the same speaker played for over 7 hours (next to my cell at low volume but still....)  I contacted the manufacturer again and they were very accomodating.Now I love it.  The sound is very good from such a small device and the battery coverage is also very good.  Further, the manufacturer is ver accomodating.  I'm a believer. Great price for a great product.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"Durable - good sound quality - long battery life. I keep it plugged in most of the time, in my kitchen. The other two speakers I attempted to use (both Anker Soundcores) began to sound scratchy in the same location after just a few months. This sturdy little thing keeps on going.  The only thing that's less than ideal on this one is there's a rubber stopped hanging by basically a thread that is supposed to cover the port, and it doesn't really stay on - pops off when I try to seal it, so I just don't seal it.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"I’m not sure why this got so many good reviews. I can only assume it’s because the reviewers prefer a low price over sound quality. This speaker is cheap and easy to use, but after years of listening to Bose speakers this one was utter disappointment. I used this for a week and then spent the money on a new Bose as I should’ve done in the first place. If you’re on a really tight budget then maybe this speaker is for you, but if care about sound quality I’d definitely recommend you spend the money on a high end speaker.",1,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"Well, it worked okay for a few weeks though the sound volume was subpar. Doesn't like to hold a charge for very long as I would say you might get 8-10 hours initially but it degrades quickly. After 3 months, charge was only lasting about 4-6 hours and now it will only hold for about 2 hours so it essentially is no longer a viable option for what it was purchased for. Cannot return the item so I would definitely look for a different brand. And Bluetooth connectivity started cutting in and out after 3 months of use. A bit annoying but resyncing it every time you turned it on wasn't a big issue at first.",2,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
After buying a speaker from Walmart that went out in less than a month I was looking for something to fit my needs and would last. This little speaker has been great. I bought it after reading a lot of reviews on different speakers and was not disappointed. This little thing puts out great sound and doesn’t take up much space on my counter. From time to time if I move my phone to far away from the speaker it may go in and out for a moment but then corrects itself. When I have it on I can hear it all through my house and basement without it even being all the way up. I would def recommend to anyone looking for a speaker with great sound and a small price tag.,5,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
"I'm 66 and kind of over the whole driving-solo-across-country thing. I never would have made it without music. I got a DC adaptor with 2 USB ports (Zus), so I could charge the speaker and iPod (or phone) as needed. The sound in the hotels was great. In the car, there were a lot of variables to consider, including the type and quality of the road surface, driving speed, and from time to time, weather. (Driving in a downpour kind of dampens the sound a bit.) Also source material. Some of the tunes have been on my iPod since the first one came out, and equalized or not, there's a wide range in playback volume. Further, there was some dropout from road noise listening to someone like Nick Drake as opposed to, say Pit Bull. The + and - buttons on the end of the unit, which sat next to me on the passenger seat, made it easy to adjust. Also used the pause button when Siri needed to chime in with directions. I did use the ""forward"" button on the iPod (clipped to my shorts, so easy access) to skip to the next song where I had a few duplicates. This speaker saved my brain on this trip. Clearer in a quiet environment, but nearly as great on the road. It worked perfectly and I have used it every day since I got here.",5,1,2017-6-30,1,0,0
"I drive a tractor-trailer with no radio in it - and to make it worse I move from truck to truck. So I needed something small, something to overcome the truck noise, and something wireless. This is the second speaker I've had. The first  was the popular round one with a clip on it. It never was loud enough for what I needed. It lasted about six months. This OontZ speaker is perfect for my needs! It is loud enough and sounds so much better than the other one I had, and fits anywhere - the cup holder, open overhead compartment, and the non-slip feet allows it to sit on the dash (except on really rough roads). And it is still small enough for me to carry it in my brief case so I can keep my music on while attending to duties out of the truck. Another big plus is the easy to use, and easy to find, control buttons. They large enough to be seen at a glance and volume buttons have raised plus and minus symbols that you can feel with the tip of your finger so your eyes never have to leave the road ahead. Great Speaker!",5,1,2016-7-25,1,1,0
Don't judge a book by it's cover. This tiny little speaker has some great sound!  Playing it on our back porch and they kids next door could hear it out front.  It charges quickly and lasts forever.  Plus it's really easy to connect with. Great purchase at a reasonable price.  Very pleased.EDIT: Attended an outdoor event with my little Oonzt speaker .

"I've had this about 9mo. Sound quality (and volume louder than equally sized at price point), battery and performance has been impressive... For a few weeks now the bluetooth has spontaneously cut off then restarted... not that big a deal, i use the speaker for maybe 5hrs/ week, bluetooth off/on happens maybe once or twice every time i play the unit; i just restart the player. this wasnt an issue when i first bought the speaker so i'm making the assumption that it'll happen more often... possibly the speaker... possibly some new interference in the area affecting the bluetooth signal, i only use this speaker at home and never take it anywhere else.  for the price though, i still thnk a solid purchase",4,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
This is a great little BT speaker with decent bass and sound volume. Zero concerns of it tipping over due to the design and the silicone rubber edges that grips surfaces well. I have BT headsets but they are bulky and slide off when I am doing housework and chores and sometimes I want to share the music with my husband. This is a perfect solution. It might not be best for outdoors in terms of sound wavelength/strength over ambient sounds but for small get-togethers it should suffice. I am relatively new to the BT gadgets & this exceeded my expectations.,5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"Seeing the great reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try instead of buying a more expensive speaker.  I was willing to settle for less premium sound in exchange for a cheaper product.  In reality, I was looking for a product that had enough volume to play outside when riding bikes with the kids (sitting in a child trailer), or when working outside, or when working inside.  The sound quality itself is as expected for a lower quality speaker, but it is within expectations.  However, the volume of the speaker is far below what I needed, or even expected.  If using this outside, the volume is not enough to keep from being drowned out by outside noise which makes the speaker not usable for a great deal of what a Bluetooth speaker should be used for.  The speaker is, however, sufficient for indoors, even with moderate noise (turned at high volume).  The sound is just absorbed and lost outdoors.  I am trusting Amazon reviews far less these days.  While this isn't a horrible product, I would categorize this as below average for the price.",2,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"For the size of it, this speaker performs surprising well. Though, there are some minor defects in the casing. On the technical side, when paired with  certain devices like a laptop or a desktop, the volume is set to maximum by default. This could cause damage to the speaker and a little discomfort to your ears. Actually battery life is about 9 hours with continuous use. Bass performance isn't as good as I was hoping for. There are other speakers in the market with 15W. This one has 10W. But the response in the higher frequency range is fairly decent. As to pairing, it's quite good, actually. I have tested this speaker with about 5 different devices and they paired OK.The label says the product was designed in the US but made in China.",3,1,2017-6-28,1,1,0

It’s great to listen to music with until it decides to change its volume . It sometimes is louder and sometimes more quite than the original setting you put it at. It gets frustrating having to chg the volume only to have to change back again after the volume changes again. It doesn’t make any sense. I’m debating whether to keep or not.

For the price you really cannot beat this.  It's small and portable, works great, looks trendy and is powerful.  Love it!I also like to cook a lot and spend a lot of time cleaning and making messes in the kitchen.  The fact that this is splashproof is a big deal to me.  I can take in the kitchen with me or even in the bathroom when I'm taking a shower, and it's so loud that I can always hear it and don't have to worry about it getting a tiny bit wet.",5,1,2018-4-19,1,0,0

The audio quality even at high volumes from this small speaker is excellent. I have used it next to the shower but never quite subjected it to direct water impact. Despite the great audio, the bluetooth performance renders it useless and frustrating. Maybe our problems are specific to Nexus devices running Android Marshmallow, but connections are very unreliable. Establishing a connection takes many tries, and then after finally connecting, the audio stops even though the device indicates it is still connected. We've had this problem with two Nexus 5, one Nexus 9 and one Nexus 7.

"Not what the description stated.  I thought the triangular design would be cool but it did not improve the sound - it diminishes it.  There's a reason speakers have always been rectangular and not triangular - because of the acoustics properties of that shape.  Go to any convert and see how many speakers are triangular = zero.  The sound quality (volume & bass) was 1/3 of my DOSS portable bluetooth speaker, which was actually less expensive and 2 years old.  I played them simultaneously at the same volume when connected to my phone.  I'm returning mine today.  If you do get the DOSS speaker, consider purchasing the 2 year warranty for $2, as they are notoriously inconsistent for randomly not connecting to bluetooth.

That's not to say that this is the best sounding speaker out there, because it probably isn't. I am extremely pleased with it for the price I paid though. I use this for a smaller size gym that I go to. I typically have the volume nearly maxed out and there's absolutely no distortion. I can keep my phone in my pocket and walk all over the gym without losing connection to the speaker. The bass on this isn't superb, but it is there. If you're looking for something with a lot of bass, you may consider buying a higher priced unit. That shouldn't take away from this speaker though, because it really does sound great.

I bought 2, one for myself and one for my husband who took our nicer, more expensive Bluetooth speaker to work and it NEVER came back! So I chose this speaker for the price in case his grows legs again and walks off and also just to see if all of these great reviews were true.Buy the speaker! I'm serious! It pairs really easily with any of our devices and apps, works great and the SOUND is just phenomenal! Such a tiny thing packs a big punch, the sound quality is really good, actually gets very loud and has great tone, a little bass and awesome clarity. Very happy with my purchase. Now let's hope my husband's speaker doesn't wander off to work with him and get lost. Good thing these are a great price!",5,1,2017-5-30,1,1,0
"Former audiophile so I am very critical on my sound systems.  But new house with pool is pretty far out from the house and I did not want to run another amp receiver out with rock speakers.  So I went with Angle 3, Cambridge Soundworks, a very recognized name.  It works unbelievable!  Have now removed hardwired desktop speakers and use only the Angle 3 by my Mac.  Using I Tunes, or Youtube music, I can put the speaker out by the pool, 93' away and it runs perfectly on bluetooth.  Great sound, great bass as advertised.  Use in living room and kitchen as well.  A great product.  Have already bragged on it to family and friends.",5,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0
"I may not know about a lot of things, but I do know about bluetooth speakers. I buy them, try them and then give them to my employees. It is a small, but seems to be much appreciated gesture.CAMBRIDGE NEVER DISAPPOINTS! Connectivity is good even with some of my worst devices. Battery life is good but not always great. But you can drive these little babies over a cliff with volume and distortion is amazingly low.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I don't dislike anything!  I was looking for a small , Bluetooth speaker,I could move about.  From basement to garage, and still have "" good "" musical sound.  I thought I'd chance  the Oontz,  and it doesn't disapoint!  I can't speak to battery life, I haven't  had to charge it yet!  Sound is more than good,  it's very good for one small speaker!  I haven't  gotten it wet yet, but I'm sure I will.  If your looking for the  same as I was, just buy it!  You won't be disappointed!",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I purchased this speaker in 2017. Almost three years later, and it has stood the test of time. It is a quality speaker with great sound and connectivity. Is it the fanciest on the market? No. But for what you pay for–– it is truly a steal. Plus, you have to know what this is good for. One of my favorite features of this speaker is that it is small and compact. Because of its size, I have been able to bring it with me everywhere–– beach, shower, pregames, etc. And though it is small, it can get preeeetttty loud. All in all, I would highly recommend this!",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"I have owned this speaker for a year (purchased Aug 2019). The sound is surprisingly loud and clear. I bought it to listen to podcasts and YouTube videos in the shower, which it's great for, but I've ended up using it for everything! It's a great, simple speaker that works VERY well. If you are looking for a value (not cheap) speaker that just boosts your device's speaker performance without compromising on build or sound quality, this is the speaker for you. 10/10 would recommend.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"The sound IS superior. No doubt. But I experience an awful hissing white noise while the device is recharging. The claim that it plays while charging isn't worth much if the sound is drowned out with fuzzy interference. Crap shielding perhaps? Also, this device is being idrntified by my laptop as an Android phone, and my OS is contantly seeking a driver for it. And sometimes my OS will respond to the speakers presence by automaticaly throttling down my mixer. Lastly, my Bluetooth doesn't make a functioning connection. My Bluetooth chipset is probably too old, but it've been nice if Oontz was prepared to pair with older devices, and not just the latest ones.",4,1,2017-12-15,1,1,0

I really loved this product all the up to the time it went for swim off my boat. I am sure the fish are now using at the bottom of the lake since it is waterproof. All jokes aside you really get a great sounding speaker for really cheap in this product. It is very loud and clear. It does get a little distorted while the volume is all the way up but sounds close to my Bose. I needed a little speaker for my boat while fishing this was an inexpensive fix I loved it. I am buying another.,5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"The main thing about this is how loud it can get, it's battery life, and generally good sound quality. The only complaint I have is that turning it off seems to be a challenge and finding the power button is too. I don't know why switches aren't used anymore, as you can easily shut things off and find it. It's a bit nit picky to complain about it though. I would recommend buying it over most Bluetooth speakers. You will not regret the choice.",4,1,2019-2-14,1,1,0
I bought specifically to pair with an Echo Dot(gen 3). it paired easily and I did not have any connection issues even with the dot and this speaker on separate floors in my house.I like how music sounds through these speakers compared to the just the Dot. I just wish the bass was a bit stronger. But considering its size and design you're not going to get a lot of bass.,4,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

"I love this little portable speaker, it works perfectly, the sound can be adjusted up to a pretty high volume for my liking. I think it honestly depends on what setting you are using it for. Our use it for a speaker in my art studio, which is pretty quiet, so I think this speaker works amazingly well. I haven’t tested it during a party or at a barbecue yet, however I think it would work great as standard background noise for those events.This speaker does come with two separate cords to make it easy for you to use and to charge the speaker as needed.",5,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"For the money, this is a nice speaker to have on my desk....just a couple of feet away.  Its small package is nice.

"I am going to make this a short one, since there is not much to say about this item. I knew I was expending few bucks for it and would be not fair to compare this speaker with other brands such as Bose or JBL which I've tested to sound a lot better.However the lack of bass frequencies is very annoying, the music is so colored that it is pointless to save the money. This is not workable for my taste (not that I am a huge audiophile guy, just an average music lover), not even for a party outdoors.",2,1,2018-5-6,1,0,0
"Right out of the box, the speaker is beautiful. The nice minimal branding of the coke design in the front of the speaker and the classic coke logo on the back. It really is a nice looking speaker.The only problem is the sound quality. The lack of any quantifiable amount bass is astounding in a modern bluetooth speaker. This speaker leans to more of the mids and highs and with certain songs it distorts like crazy, which is a shame. Also, with the way the speaker is built. If you are not fully facing the speaker the volume drops considerably.",2,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"I really like how quickly the bluetooth connects and disconnects.  I've had earbuds and other devices that are difficult to pair or connect and this is the best bluetooth connectivity I've ever experienced!  It makes using the speaker really fun.  The bass is lacking compared to a speaker I had called the ""Jam Thrill"", but the sound quality is great and can get pretty loud as well.  Just don't expect any boom from this one.  Overall I'd definitely buy one for a friend.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,2,0
"I am rating it as an item within a small-speaker bluetooth category--not as a stereo-system speaker. This device paired with my iPhone 7 immediately. It was a five-minute setup. I bought it to play bird sounds. It does a great job for that. It does a decent job on music if you do not want your music very loud. The limits become very clear when you play it at maximum volume. For its size and price, I am quite pleased. It is nice having one less set of wires--particularly when you are out and about.",5,1,2017-5-7,1,3,0
"On average, I probably use this speaker once every 4 - 6 weeks. I used it more often in the first year I owned it. I bought it nearly 4 years ago, and it is still working well now.In the early days, my devices sometimes struggled to pair with the speaker correctly. My newer phones and tablets have no trouble pairing with it, however. And after a successful initial pairing, it seems to subsequently pair without difficulty.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"By all means, I do not do sound for a living but I've had more than 15 years dealing with sound through managing bands, switchboards, and mixers that include many types of sizes and shapes of speakers. Therefore, I do know sound quality when I hear it. To the untrained ear, this little speaker would suffice. I asked my wife (who has a ""regular ear"") and she likes it and thinks its great quality. Honestly, I think it's too high in treble and the bass doesn't really kick in unless the volume is on high. If you are using this for holiday parties and/or family, friend gatherings I would save the extra money and grab a bigger base sound speaker. If this is for personal use, it does the job.",2,1,2018-3-7,1,1,0
"It seems to be working fine at first but stopped working properly after some use, static accompanies the item for every single use after some time and there was no way to get rid of it... You would probably not notice the static with loud music playing but you can definitely, clearly hear the loud static once you mute every other sound, as though the speaker makes sound on its own, and there was just no good reason to explain how or why.",1,1,2017-12-12,1,3,0
"My old nifty little speaker died randomly and I'd been looking for something for awhile.  While this unit is a couple times bigger than my other one, it's still compact, and sounds fine for what it is.

"I have always love Bose speaker, but I wanted something cheaper for now (mainly for my kids and work). So base on the stars and reviews, I thought to give this a try. I am very happy with the purchase. We mainly use the speaker indoors and the sound quality and value is good enough. I don't think it will work as well outdoor as I might want it even louder than its current max. Overall, the battery life and connection works well and fast and long lasting. I would buy this again.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"This speaker connects with my Dell Latitude 3470. It disconnects when I shut the laptop down. It doesn't reconnect upon startup. I start it up to connect again. Every time this happens the audio is terrible (like static background), and the sound waves in and out. The audio does sound better again when I take the speaker down from the high shelf, hard wire it to the laptop, pair it again, then place it back on the high shelf. This defeats the purpose of owning this speaker for me. I will keep it because it isn't too inconvenient to pair with my mobile phone when traveling.",2,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
For a speaker this small you're not going to get a big sound but this does great out on a boat or on the campsite. I stored this in its box in the shop and forgot all about it. It sat through a cold winter and even hotter summer. I just now dug it out from storage and hooked up just to see if there was any batter left. Still 60% after being stored away for a little over a year. I forget the brand but my previous waterproof bluetooth speaker seemed to melt apart after a hot summer.,5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I usually try to avoid cheap electronics especially when it comes to music, but this thing is excellent!  Good sound, plenty loud without a whole lot of distortion.

"This is a great speaker when it works. The major design flaw is the charging port.When I first got the speaker, I noticed that the charging wasn't consistent. I had to position it a certain way to make it work. I didn't think much of it at the time. I thought it was the USB cable that was the fault, so I just kept buying new USB cables until I got it through my thick skull that it was the speaker that was the issue, not the cables since the cables work with every other device (my Wacom tablet uses the same USB cable and it works perfectly there, so the cable is not at fault).",2,1,2018-10-28,1,0,0
"I bought this OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) on Black Friday because of the amazing reviews and the incredible price of less than $20. However, as always, you get what you pay for. Took it out of the box and connected to BlueTooth right away no problems. But from the first note of music I was so disappointed with the audio quality; all high end treble and absolutely no low end bass. I played several more songs trying to here some kind of low end, but alas it's just not there. So this guy is going back in the box and back to Amazon. Some folks might not care (my wife said she thought it sounded great), but if you have any ear for music and want a good, well balanced sound, this speaker is not going to satisfy you.",3,1,2019-12-6,1,1,0
"I have always been a fan of Cambridge Soundworks, after buying the OntZ Angle 3, I am more of a fan! This tiny triangular speaker is clear and crisp sounding. The best part is that it is featherlight and so well designed. I can carry it from room to room and stream the radio or music. Another fantastic feature is the fact that I can take a shower with it balanced on the towel rack. I recommend getting the carrying case. This is good to have especially if you are going to have a picnic or go outside with it. The carry case is is well designed and as well thought out as the speaker. The case features a caribiner to attach the speaker to your gear or yourself. Additionally, they thoughfully added at the end side of the case a compartment that is netted and stretches, a great addition for carry the included charging cable. There is also an auxiliary input so if your device that you are playing your sounds on is not Bluetooth equipped you can plug it directly in and the cable is included. Pairing and setting up the tiny BIG sounding speaker is fast and easy - no codes to put in. Charge it (that is quick) and in a moment it is paired and you are good to go. I had a technical issue and sent an email with my phone number within HOURS there was a person who called me and was there to help me an they DID. What more can I say other than I am more than happy with the OntZ Angle 3 speaker. I highly recommend this tiny Dynamo. Buy it you will be pleased! They have great customer service this is a big PLUS! I shower with it daily!",5,1,2016-4-22,1,0,0
"Picked this up to use with my macbook pro which I use as my mounted desktop while I'm at home.  This is being used now to play spotify music along with all audio from my computer as well.  It sounds amazing, I couldn't believe it was that rich of a sound for it's size when i first started playing it from my iphone when I first pulled it out of the box.  I haven't used it much as of yet since I'm not home alot, but I've played around with it.  I'm very happy for my needs.  The treble is clear, it's smooth through the midrange and it has a bass to it I didn't think possible with something that tiny.  (I don't play hiphop/rap so not that kind of bass)It sounds worlds better than my laptop speaker, and the size is nice since it's just a touch bigger than the palm of my hand... which means I can just chuck it into my backpack and roll if I was about to travel.",5,1,2017-3-1,1,1,0

Speaker Phone is loud and crystal clear on both ends. Played some Youtube and Pandora on it and got that great low bass and crisp high's only better now since Gen 1. Has more volume than previous generations. I would say for my ears the sound quality is GREAT and as great as BOSE. This is great for a desk top or maybe the kitchen table, but maybe not suitable for large areas.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"I reviewed this shortly after I bought it and raved about it but sometimes problems arrive over time. I am delighted to report that I love it even more now that I have used it for a while. It works great. I use it with my laptop (Pandora and Amazon Music) and with my antiquated receiver. I carry the speaker everywhere I go even out to the patio. The sound quality is excellent. It pairs up quickly and easily with the blue tooth transmitter I bought with it. I love, love, both of these.",5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"I just received my new OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Portable Speaker, and I'm blown away by the sound of such a small speaker. Great quality sound, made with good materials that leave the speaker heavier than I first thought.  I've owned other Bluetooth speakers, and none of them have the sound quality as this speaker, especially for the price.  I payed more for less, and now that I know what this can do, I'm going to keep it. You never know the sound of a speaker until you get it, and I've been burned on all other speakers I've ever bought, except one I bought for my husband a few years ago for Christmas, but that one was much more expensive than this speaker, with the same quality sound.",4,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"Very simple process for Bluetooth link to phone. After you link it once, it remembers. After that, just turn it on and it will automatically link to your phone. You can pause it, walk away with the phone, when you come back, it’s linked, just hit play. So I love the user friendliness of the Bluetooth. I haven’t played it for  over a couple hours so I don’t know the full battery life but the recharge for me is pretty quick and you can leave it charging with no problems. And the sound is pretty decent for a non-Bose device. You do get a little extra base from the bottom port it’s sitting on a hard surface. I had it on a soft cooler at the beach and that absorbs the base. It is loud enough to hear on the windy beach but we do keep it close to us. It’s perfect for beach music for the two of us.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

It still works great. The battery life is still great and I haven't seen any loss in battery life since I've gotten it. It produces a heck of a lot of sound for it's size and I've had friends ask about it and order it after hearing mine. It's cheap and it's awesome. Just get it.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Light weight. I guess that means it doesn't have a big battery. I had a JamBox that weighed double. It's loud enough for personal use, but don't expect it to fill a room for a small crowd. The bass doesn't go very low. Maybe 150hz. But the sound stays clear which is a good thing. I know it's hard to get any bass out of something this small. But I wanted small and portable. Don't expect a bass pounding room filled with music for a crowd of twenty. If you want a clean sound for a couple or yourself, yeah it will work. It's ideal use is with a cell phone when out at a park, perhaps camping.",3,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0
"After pulling it out of the box, initial impressions are that it is built well.  No rattles when you shake it, gel/rubber ends are securely attached, and it doesn't smell like Chinese plastic.  It came nearly fully charged, and with a short (4ish inches) USB charging cord as well as a longer (12ish inches) 1/8"" audio aux in cable.  No wall adapter, but it's not like we don't have those laying around.  Size is smaller than I expected but perfect for packing in my carry on or laptop bag.Some people on here complained about the power button, I think it's fine.  If you can't find it, you probably have a hard time figuring out to turn on your iPhone.  All the buttons work well and as they should.  It paired flawlessly and seems to have no issues playing music from my phone 30ft away.",4,1,2016-6-23,1,1,0
"It worked as soon as it was unboxed, though it didn't work as long as expected understandably as it arrived with a partial charge. Sound is crisp and clear. It can be used either vertically or horizontally which is ideal if space is precious. I've only attempted to pair it with one item and it worked immediately. I want to try it with my laptop and tablet and will update my review accordingly. Nice speaker and sound quality.Update: could not successfully pair with windows laptop,  I'll see if there's another way to use it.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"The sound quality is excellent when it is on Bluetooth. It is elegantly designed. Two issues, one minor, one less minor:the power switch is basically invisible. It would be great if there were some contrast with the body to make it more easily findable.  A larger concern is what happens if I want to use it with the analog cord.  Although it did not do this initially, after two days it began making an annoying and constant hum. I swapped out cables to see if it was an issue with the one I was using (the one it came with), but it made the same hum with a different cable.  That means it is essentially only usable as a Bluetooth device. I don’t know if others have had this same issue?",4,1,2018-9-23,1,0,0
I ordered this as a replacement for my non-working stereo in my companies work truck. Seems like it will fit the bill. The sound quality isn’t the greatest but it is actually pretty loud for its size which I like. I won’t have to worry much about the battery life since I’ll constantly have it plugged into my truck. The Bluetooth connectivity seems to work well even at longer distances but again won’t have to worry about that much since I’ll be keeping my phone in my truck with it.

"I like this speaker it has really good sound quality and I did not have to do anything special to get my iPhone to find this speaker for blue tooth. I had i up and running right away. It is sturdy and I think a really good deal for the price. It's kind of annoying that the battery life is only 7 hours, I would prefer longer, but if you think about it as long as you charge it up before you plan to take it out somewhere to use it it is fine because whatever device you have it connected to (i.e. my phone) likely doesn't hold a charge much longer than that anyway when in use so overall it is a good deal. I would say get the amazon hard shell case for this instead of the OontZ case because it is a much sturdier higher quality case for the same price.",5,1,2017-6-3,1,1,0

It has a powerful speaker and I think we’re going on about 8-9 hours on one charge. I place it right on the edge of a hot tub cover and use the angle of the cover to amplify music. It may not have as great a tone as the Bose speaker, but it’s a tenth the price and I discovered that most places that have a bunch of water also have a bunch of background and ambition noise so it doesn’t need to be perfect. I’m super pleased.",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"The first Oontz Angle 3 we received had excellent sound for such a small speaker, but the bluetooth was intermittent and would drop out every few seconds. Sometimes it would work if I re - paired it up to the bluetooth on my computer, but that would not always work. Because of this difficulty, we rarely used the speaker.  We recently signed up with Audible, and wanted to use the speaker to listen to books, but again, not able to enjoy because of the many drop outs.I didn't think that there was much that we could do because we'd already had it for 4 months at this point. Just in case, I wrote to Oontz and was happy to find that the representative was wonderful and responsive - he sent me another speaker which arrived within days. This second one is much better than the first.  So far, only minor and infrequent drop outs.",4,1,2016-1-30,1,3,0
Not one bad thing to say about this stereo speaker.  EXCEPT !!!  worse fitting female usb plug ever!  It’s too big. If you look at it too long the male plug will just fall out.

And the battery last super long, I used it all day at my birthday party and the battery didn't die at all. The range is also amazing, I could connect it to my phone and go downstairs with my phone and it will stay connected. It does come with a mini aux cord which is great and charges with a micro USB cable (also included) It shipped really well and nothing was broken or out of shape and it was packaged so that if it was thrown around in the mail, it wouldn't damage the product. I love this speaker and would 100% recommend it. This is comparable to the Bose Soundlink Color, as I do own that as well, but I like this one better because it was less expensive with the same sound quality and it was more portable (as in it could fit in my crossbody) vs. the Bose, I would need to use a tote or a bigger handbag. It's super amazing and it's great that it's affordable. IT DOES NOT MEAN IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT'S AFFORDABLE! This compares to much more expensive speakers and it being affordable is another plus.

I guess it's ok if you want something temporary, but if you want something that will last a while, I suggest you fork over a few extra dollars and get something built well without cheap components that wear out in less than a year.Original review:",2,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
"My initial review was for one star and all the ramblings below but after i posted this I went to there website to see what i could do with two broken units. To my surprise  i sent in two different warranty claims and within hours I got a response. Not only were they very apologetic, but they offered to replace both units at no cost to me, along with giving me a blue and pink one, instead of the two black ones. I think they might have offered me a carrying case for free to for all my troubles but even if they didn't they went beyond what id ever expect a company to do for a 30 dollar Bluetooth speaker. AMAZING SOUND, AMAZING PRODUCT, and ever more AMAZING COMPANY. This is a must buy, if not for the customer service alone, which you never find now-a-days.The once 1 Star Review",5,1,2016-7-19,1,2,0
Update:Stopped working/charging after 9-12 months.,3,1,2018-3-21,1,0,0
"This little speaker has some amazing sound at this price point.I was expecting half as much sound from this thing and was very surprised as to how well it performed with bass heavy music (rap stations) to acoustics (70s rock, Yes, Classical guitar).",5,1,2017-9-12,1,8,0
"This is a wonderful speaker! For about a year! Then the inputs gets unreliable and you have to jiggle cords to get it to work. Then the battery stops recharging.  Bluetooth never did work.  But for 24 bucks, its a good little speaker, but recommend that you view it as a summer romance not a lifetime thing.",3,1,2019-4-1,1,2,0
"This came and it is small and light, and surprisingly loud for it's size. The bass isn't very apparent but decent. The reason why you'd buy this speaker is portability and it's ""weatherproofness"". Connecting was a breeze, you can also sync it to your computer if you want better sound. For the price and brand, it is a no brainer if you need something portable and you don't mind getting dirty or scratched up. I know if I brought out a more expensive speaker and it got damaged, I would feel a little unhappy. Did I mention this thing is light and I don't know how they managed to fit a battery with good life in there. If you want more bass, get the bigger one. This is just to listen to on the move.",5,1,2016-11-13,1,2,0
"The speaker arrived on time, and it paired immediately to my android phone's Bluetooth.  Additionally, the speaker contained enough of a battery charge to enjoy, right out of the box. The sound is crisp and clear: additionally, the speaker can be concealed anywhere, which is a big plus when company is over for dinner.  Very pleased, and will add another review in the months to come, if problems arrive.  (I didn't fill in the stars for the battery life because I've used it only for less than a week since it arrived.)",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"This is a small/medium speaker with decent sound output.  I bought a speaker from another manufacture that has a much better sound. It cost me $12 more, but the sound was better and the size/dimensions were better for my needs",3,1,2019-9-8,1,2,0
"I was initially surprised at the sound quality after connecting the speaker to my 2nd Generation Echo Dot. I was happy with the sound quality as it certainly was much richer and deeper than that of my Dot. I wanted to use it to play music in my garage, and for that purpose this small form factor speaker will work perfectly. It isn't going to blow my ears off, but it also loud enough to enjoy at a comfortably high volume. The speaker will fill a small room with crisp and clear tones and is a significant upgrade when listening to music on the standard Echo Dot speakers. I haven't tried the battery nor the bluetooth connection as of yet. So far, I'm very pleased with my purchase!",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"I wasn't sure about ordering a little speaker to be used with my laptop.  When I saw the size of it, I really had my doubts.  But that little speaker speaks big and clear!!  It wasn't hard to connect to what I wanted to and all and all I am very pleased.  I would recommend this speaker to anyone who just wants to improve the speaker quality.  Not sure about all of the bells and whistles some want with speakers, but for what I want it for, it does the job.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"I have had several bluetooth speakers including the early ones that cost then 200$. This unit beats them all. I know a fair amount about tech yet I cannot figure out how they engineered such deep and clear sound quality out of such a small device. Also, I very much like that the unit stays connected to my phone even when no signals are being transmitted. So, when I get a phone call or other alert the speaker is in connected mode and announces the incoming call. I have another bluetooth speaker that was on sale for $13 in November that is also good, but powers down after about 90 seconds of dormancy so I have to power it on whenever I was to use it.",5,1,2018-1-4,1,1,0
My only challenge is the brick/block walls of my house.  We use this perched on the edge of the window so the laptop will connect and create an audible screen between inside and out.  Great way to take the music outside for work (louder) or for dinner (softer) and still have the versatility of my vast music store on the laptop.  Have used it for outside events connecting with my phone as well.  As long as there's not a heavy wall in your way this little wonder works fabulously!,5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"Great Bluetooth speaker with good sound and volume. Easily connected to any phone without hassle.I take it with me when I travel and have used it every week for nearly 3 years. Originally bought the OontZ Angle 3 in September 2016. This week in August 2019, it turned off randomly mid-song. It was on battery so I put it for charge but it never turned on again. The power light just blinks as if it's charging but nothing happens. Even after hours on the charger it won't turn on. Checked the manufacturer's website and the warranty is only 90 days. So I opened it to see if anything was loose but it looks fine.",4,1,2019-8-17,1,1,1
"What can I say? Like many, I have owned several Bluetooth speakers, and I must say, this is by far the best in this price range and including even some of the expensive ones. Since there are many great reviews already, let me be brief:1. LONG BATTERY LIFE. Compared to other speakers I own, the battery lasts longer. And charges quickly too.",5,1,2017-10-29,1,0,0
"my first one of these the charging port got big and wouldn't hold the charger?  But I love this little speaker so I bought another one.  So far, so goodchanging my review....  this is my 2nd speaker and I have the same issue as the 1st one.  I thought because I use it at work and plugged and unplugged it a lot I compromised that USB.  The speaker has great sound so I ordered another one.",1,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
"This is device is awesome. Earlier this week I purchased a different Bluetooth speaker for $14.00 but it didn't have any power. This one does. The volume can totally fill a room and works well outdoors too. The earlier device I purchased, the BLKBOX, could not produce good sound outside and indoors it was weak. I was forced to send it back. There is a world of difference with the OontZ Angle3. The sound really projects and the bass is good too. It is small enough to fit into a purse or backpack. I am so happy. Based on my first purchase, I thought I wouldn't be able to find a decent speaker at a fair price point. I am so happy I purchased this. Additionally, it is easy to use. Turn it on, Turn your phone's bluetooth on, and it connects instantly. It also includes a cable you can connect it to speaker ports without Bluetooth. Something else I like about this device is that you can answer or ignore calls with it. It also has volume buttons and a pause button. The first device I purchased didn't have additional volume buttons, but I find them helpful. If you are looking for a quality, good sounding device with ample volume and base indoors or outdoors, I recommend trying out this device.",5,1,2016-9-16,1,0,0
I love the sound.  It sounds deep and rich compared to my MacBook speakers. It's a good size but also light weight.  The volume controls are very tactile so I can feel and adjust it without having to look too closely.  It's also nice when I'm watching a movie and the laptop is on the other side of the room I can have the speaker close to me and not have to have the volume turned up all the way on the laptop to be able to hear it.The only negatives are that it can't be paired with more than one device at a time so I have to pair it again every time I switch from my phone to my laptop. And it doesn't seem to last very long (maybe a few hours?) before needing to be recharged.,5,1,2018-1-17,1,1,0
I guess you get what you pay for like they say. This speaker is only a tiny bit loader than my iPhone. I am very disappointed with this item. It was a waste of money.,1,1,2019-7-13,1,3,0
"I purchased this speaker for when I do projects around the yard and around the house but didn't want to spend a ton of money because it will be used outside and probably be getting dirty. I was tired of wearing headphones and having the cord get caught on things, not being able to have a conversation with someone without taking the headphones off and the speaker in the phone is awful. This is a great alternative for what I need it for and the sound quality is good.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"It stop working and I have been using it for about 6 weeks. IT was PERFECT, when it was working. The sound quality and range was just awesome. However at week 5 the quality and range tank. however it was still usable and I just thought that this is what you get when you spend $25 for a Bluetooth speaker. Then not 6 days go buy and it just stop. Will not turn on and it will not even work while it is plug in. In addition their is no signs that the item is even charging.I am going to see if I can return or exchange this. I might have just gotten a bad one. Will up date latter.",1,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"The speaker paired easily with the phone, and LG G5, for my sins. It's ok. Not spectacular but you won't get spectacular for thirty bucks. The sound is decent for a speaker this size. I don't hvae any complaints now, but I did read all the reviews that mention flimsy charging ports and the battery not holding a charge, and so on. It hasn't yet had any significant use at all yet so I can't comment on those points. I do expect an item this tiny to have a sturdy charging port as it will be used so often. If anything goes wrong I'll let you know, including any contact with amazon or the seller if necessary, and how that goes.",3,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"Works really well.  Far better than our previous cheapos.  It came charged and as soon as I hit the power button, (a little sticker was pointing to it so it was easy to find) the OontZ speaker registered on my laptop and connected immediately. Great price, easily portable, lightweight, projects sound quite well (I could hear the sound while washing dishes, which is a huge thing!!  Running water tends to be louder than tablet or laptop speakers.) Distance for connection is really great too!  I walked around 40 steps away and it only started to get a little crackly. The bass isn't huge but this speaker is meant for basic use, not pounding beats ;) I definitely recommend this for anyone who streams tv/movies on their laptop/tablet/phone.  Smaller devices don't have great speakers so this Oontz is an excellent addition!",5,1,2016-10-8,1,2,0
"This speaker wouldn't reconnect to my PC when I turned it on.  I had to fight with it EVERY time, uninstalling it (which would fail), or rebooting it multiple times...  Then I noticed it was trying to create a bunch of profiles and COM ports, and it was difficult (impossible?) to delete them as well.  I can't remove the Oontz Angle 3 or the weird ROMAN device it created from my devices now.  Sending it back... sound quality isn't great, and no speaker is worth this level of headache to get to work properly.  All of my other bluetooth devices work flawlessly (headphones, controller, phone connection, laptop).  This one is just garbage; not trusting another Oontz product.",2,1,2018-9-19,1,0,0
"We bought this on March 30th. It is now August 4th and the device no longer works. It has a 3 month warranty and after 4 months it died. We use it outside, but it does not get left in the elements, nor was it dropped into the pool or anything like that. So we paid $26 for this and got 4 months use out of it. I called Amazon, but they referred me to the manufacturer who only has a 4 month warranty. Very Sad. I thought if I paid more, I would get a better product.",1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"I purchased this Bluetooth speaker for my wife to play Christmas music on her Smartphone over the holidays.  The sound quality is certainly a big improvement from her Smartphone and she has no complaints with it.  I consider myself a bit of an audiophile however, and find the sound quality rather mediocre (not bad in any way, just 'alright').The build quality appears to be excellent, and the device paired effortlessly with multiple devices I tried.  It's super-simple to use and more compact than I was expecting.  For the cost, this is a good value speaker.  It's not high-definition sound, but fine for what it is.",4,1,2017-12-1,1,1,0
"When i got this speaker it was great for the 1st month I used it to listen to the superbowl & used it around the house maybe 5 times. Then it just stopped working. I took it to the beach, didn't work; pool didn't work; tested at home & realized it is just now a bad connection for some reason. & my phone connects fine to other speakers through Bluetooth. Sucks that I bought for spring & summer & w COVID I didn't have the opportunity to do that for the 1st time until 2 weeks ago & now its passed the return time😪🙄",1,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"I ordered this speaker on November 30, 2016. On January 20, 2017, it no longer works. It worked this morning but now it will not establish a connection with my computer. I've tried resetting it, turning off and on bluetooth, re-pairing with my computer but nothing. The blue light just keeps flashing. My other Bluetooth devices (keyboard and mouse) are happy so I know it's not me or my computer. This really stinks. At least I'm still in the warranty period. I'll update the review if the replacement lasts longer.Update: Increasing by one star because of prompt response from customer service and fast delivery of new speaker. Will update again in a few months.",2,1,2017-1-20,1,1,0
"I bought one of these about a year ago for my wife for her birthday.  I have been an audio visual technician for the last 12 years and can tell you that this little guy shouldn't be able to do what it does.  Volume is more than adequate for most listeners.  Clarity is superb and despite its size the bass is okay (in my opinion it should be non-existent because of its size).  We put this thing up head to head with a Bose I-Phone Dock my wife has at work (she is a music teacher).  The Oontz flat out stomped it in every single category other than the bass response (did I mention it is like a tenth of the size of the other speaker).  This year we bought one for my father-in-law.  I have to be honest I think his Oontz sounds even better than ours.  The only neg on this one is it has had a few little pairing glitches where ours has had zero problems. In short, for $25 bucks you can't beat this thing: volume, clarity, easy to use, ultra portable and rugged.  I applaud Cambridge Sound Works for their achievement with this little guy. Make your life easy and just buy it!",5,1,2017-12-29,1,2,0
"This little speaker is powerful and tough. It was thrown against a brick wall three times before the alleged thrower gave up. After the temper tantrum, it still blasts music and holds a charge, there's not even a scratch or dent on it. I highly recommend it for sound quality, portability, and raging.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
Ok not only is this thing pretty loud for it's crazy small size but the battery life is so impressive it almost makes me mad at it. I took it out into the woods and somehow this little speaker went on and on for almost 3 days. Think I've had it a little over a year now and it continues to impress. Absolute best value ever. And did I mention how fun it is to say? Go ahead. Do it. Use your best German accent and say it a couple times. If that doesn't put a smile on your face you must suck at parties. 10/10 this little guy is the best speaker I've ever ordered.,5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"I LOVE this speaker. It was a gift from my boyfriend like 2 years ago because I was suuuuuuper outdated and still had a speaker you had to hook up with an auxiliary. Lol. It is literally the BEST gift I think I have ever gotten. Music is life. I listen to it anywhere, anyway, anytime!! I was so sad when all of a sudden mine stopped working a few weeks ago. Stuck in a quarantine with 2 kids and my Mom...🤯🤯🤯. So the company was very helpful in troubleshooting with me but ultimately the motherboard needed replaced. It happens. It's an electronic. Welllll that cost just as much so I purchased a new one and LOVE IT!!! If you're just looking for music while you're in the shower or hanging out in the back yard or I even put it in my basket when I take bike rides...then this is the high quality, loud, clear Bluetooth speaker you want!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I'm moving to wireless for most of my PC accessories, so I picked out a Bluetooth speaker that would be compact enough to fit at my desk and I could throw out my old Logitech speakers. When I first got it, I thought it was so small no way would this be loud enough. Once I plugged in I was very surprised. This is definitely worth the price. I don't know how this speaker holds up with battery life. I am keeping it plugged in continuously to my computer so it's a constant charge.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I made this purchase strictly based on the number of positive reviews, knowing full well that reviews can be bought.  But, I'll tell you two things.  First, my review was not given in exchange for a gift card.  And two, this is a great little speaker.  We use it at work in our training rooms, and the amount of sound it puts out has surprised us all.  It is not a high end expensive device, but it has pretty impressive performance for the cost and size.  I'm probably still too much of a brand snob to buy one for home use where I have a Sonos and Sony (just being honest), but this is a great little speaker!",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"Staff was speedy and friendly, even answering my emails on weekends. First speaker didn't work (which I'm sure just happens sometimes with electronics). I was promptly shipped a new speaker that worked great! All my coworkers at work love when I bring the big sound in a little box. It's super handy when I'm in a car without hands free phone capability. Oontz has been steadfast and sturdy. I work in construction and take care of my things but accidents do happen...... it has been great and I will be buying some for my family this year for Christmas.Take everywhere, do anything. Had for over a year now and this thing ROCKS!",5,1,2017-11-26,1,1,0
"We did a lot of research on bluetooth speakers before purchasing. We were looking for one that was lightweight, easy to transport, easy for our kids to use, and still with great sound.  We looked into many of the high end name brand models, but they also came with a high price. Then, we stumbled upon this one.  Let's sum it up in a word:  Wow!  Great sound, easy to set up and use (even for my 9 year old), plays for hours, and the price--you can't beat it. Wish I would have stumbled upon this sooner, we could have given as Christmas gifts.  Something very functional and at a great price.  Highly recommend.",5,1,2017-12-29,1,1,0
"This is a good bluetooth speaker. It has great crisp sound and really impressive bass. So far it looks like the battery has good long life, but I've only had it about a week so I may update this review after a couple months. Likewise, I haven't had a chance to test it's durability yet. I've been recovering from surgery, but I normally commute by bike to work. As soon as I get back to that I'll get to test it's durability in the outdoors on my bike. So far I'm very happy with it though. I've used it in the bathroom while taking a shower (I never felt the need to bring it in the shower since it's got so much audio power that it carries loudly enough in the bathroom just sitting on the edge of the sink.It's also small and unassuming, although it was bigger than I expected it is not noticeable. I can have a playlist or the radio going with my iPhone in my pocket (or in another room) and just move the speaker where I'm going and the sound and portability is great!",5,1,2016-2-26,1,2,0
I purchased this speaker for my husband to use in his garage. He wanted a speaker to connect to his phone so he could listen to his music while working. It was so simple to connect via bluetooth.

"not bad - I'm a lifeguard and when I want to listen to music this does the trick. The sound quality isn't amazing, like lots of the other reviews for this say. It's what you expect for a small, relatively cheap speaker. It's definitely a bargain and the volume goes up pretty high which is good for being heard over screaming kids in pools, but compared to any of the JBL speakers, it's only ok. But pretty good for $30. If you're not willing to fork over the extra $70 for a JBL pill, then this is probably a good bet. But if you want REALLY good sound, better connectivity, a nicer appearance, then just invest in a JBL. Trust me, I have both, it's worth it.",4,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0

The one I did manage to gift all of a sudden stopped working for my brother-in-law.  He stated it kept kicking his Bluetooth off and worked for a week. It all of a sudden just stopped working.

Not sure how much longer it will go since 3/4 Volume already gives you 12 hours! :) The sound quality I think is awesome! It feels really sturdy in the hand and does not in any way feel cheaply made!

I've charged it several times? With the power light illuminating but it would not turn on nor connect with the Bluetooth. I am very disappointed as I loved this so much, always in my carry on when I travel. It has never gotten wet and I'm puzzled as to what could've happened in just 8 months.",4,1,2017-11-20,1,2,0
"I've been using this OontZ for 3 days at work all day at a mild volume and so far it's out lasting the days.  I can actually walk more than 50 feet from the speaker and it will still play.  The farthest I've probably gone is 100 line of sight and it will still work.  If I walk away like outside the building it disconnects it will shut off once it no longer detects signal.  I did order the $1.60 protection offer, just in case the Bluetooth goes out as some have stated.  But so far it's working great and it sounds pretty good when cranked up a bit.  No complaints on OontZ I would recommend this!",5,1,2019-2-9,1,0,0
"Oontz Angle 3 is a great little bluetooth speaker, but it is NOT a good speakerphone, when paired with a laptop or desktop computer.

"Truly topnotch product and exceptional value.  Sound quality is WAY better than similarly priced speakers, some of which I had bought previously but had failed).  I was surprised by the robust sound but should have expected the excellence in that Cambridge Soundworks is renowned for excellent audio products (and no, I don't know anyone in the company... just know they are at a level at least with Bose, for less $$).Also, my iPhone immediately sensed and paired with the device.

"Alright, so here's my review for this speaker. I debated awhile on buying one and this one has high reviews and a large amount of buys so it became the one I wanted to try.Out of the box, the materials are good. The rubber ends keep it stable on the table. Easy to connect to both my samsung S8 and older iPad. Audio sounds good on genres tested and there should be a video where I show 3 different genres as everybody has different tastes and might want to know what it sounds like.",5,1,2018-7-17,1,0,0

The blue tooth paired easily with my Blackberry playbook(yeah I know it's old!) and my other blue tooth stuff. My old Sandisk player isn't blue tooth so I do appreciate that there is a 3.5 mm audio cable to attach it. Small solid speaker with great sound, easy to use buttons - large enough for my 65 y.o. eyes to see without my glasses. Easy to follow quick start guide and manual. The speaker charged quickly with the usb cord. Will come in handy by the pool for water exercise!",5,1,2018-1-8,1,1,0

"This little speaker had GREAT sound right out of the box. It became my kitchen music option, and stayed up out of the way, and charged regularly. Then it just started losing oomph. Like, it won't play the bass quite as nicely, the quality of the sound has become less rich, and it's not nearly as loud. Nothing has happened to it, I haven't run it too loud or too long... it just doesn't amaze anymore. I would send it back if I felt it was worth the trouble.",4,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"Edit: about 8 months of use and the charging port became defective. A year of use and it doesn't work at all. Disappointed.Original review: It was really easy to setup and use on my Amazon Echo. And I was surprised by how loud the speaker could get and how well it transmitted sound through the room. I just bought it cause it was a cheap Bluetooth speaker. However, I hate that they give you a USB cord with no adapter, and I'm finding that even after charging for >8 hours it hardly lasts 12 hours even on standby. Continuous play time is less than 4 hours. Other reviews state how great the battery is, even saying one charge can last all week. This is either a lie by fake reviews or I received a dud. I'm going to keep trying it for now.",2,1,2018-3-15,1,0,0
"This speaker is one of those pleasant surprises in life, where the experience far exceeds expectation. I bought this on a whim. I wanted a ""beater"" Bluetooth speaker to use on hiking and camping trips where I didn't want to expose my Bose color soundlink to the elements. I didn't really care if it sounded as good as the Bose. This little speaker blows me away. It doesn't have quite the bass punch that the Bose speaker has, but it makes up for that in clarity, and with high end response. Listening to several genres of music and switching back and forth between this and the Bose, I actuality prefer this speaker. It's just so crisp and clean. For the price, I'd recommend this over any of the other Bluetooth speakers I've used.",5,1,2017-9-6,1,1,0
"That the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. That being said, I purchased it to pair with my laptop and so no real biggie.  Sound quality is very good for a $25.00 speaker.  Great volume and bass response is not too shabby.  I'm somewhat of an audio junkie and I'm impressed.  Just received it so time will tell, but overall very good initial reaction.  If however you were thinking of hooking up your Ipod to it, don't purchase.  I never imagined any kind of portable speaker without a stereo jack.  Live and learn I guess",4,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"The only reason why this speaker didn't get a 5-star rating, is because 1 week after receiving it, I found the OontZ Angle 3 Ultra for what was only $15 more. That said, this small bluetooth speaker is incredible.The amount of volume you can get out of this device when maxed out, with no distortion, as well as the bass output of what is a fairly small speaker, makes this worth the purchase 10 times over. Also handy and really cool is the fact that with newer devices, there is actually a ""battery readout"" for the remaining life of the device after it's paired.",4,1,2018-5-30,1,0,0
"This speaker started off really great.  Quick and easy bluetooth connectivity.  Sound quality really great.  After about a month of occasional use, it started to make static noises each time I tried to use it.  I tried turning it off and back on but that did not work.  I no longer use it, which is a bummer because the sound prior to this matter was great for the price and size of the speaker.  Will have to seek out another one.",2,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
"I LOVE this speaker!!! The sound quality is great, it gets really loud! And I gotta say my favorite part is it Immediately connects to the last device you paired it with, it's Soo fast and convenient! Also, it's really cute looking, I ordered the pink 1 =)HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"Pretty amazing little speaker.  I've mostly used it for watching movies without bothering others at night.  It'll throw out the volume when you want it, but I far prefer sitting this next to me instead of wearing headphones or constantly adjusting the volume.  Impressive sound quality and battery life - when needed.  I just keep it plugged in and on the table next to my recliner.  When needed, I simply push the power button,the TV goes silent and all the volume comes from this lil guy.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Bought one of these speakers for my husband to listen to his phone music while working out and he loves it.  The sound quality is very good, clear and powerful.  My father is hard of hearing and loves to watch videos on his smart phone so I bought a second speaker for him.  He is thrilled with the sound quality and he has been able to hear the videos he is watching.  He has even been able to listen to music through the speaker, something he can't normally do because of the low volume on phones.  Wonderful product!  I would highly recommend it for the great quality and reasonable price.",5,1,2018-1-20,1,1,0
"This little speaker is pretty awesome! My husband bought it for me a few months back. I won't lie, I wasn't expecting much because it didn't look like it'd be ""awesome"". I was pleasantly surprised, though. He took it out of the box, synched it with the Bluetooth my phone (which was insanely easy) and turned on Pandora. I was so surprised at how loud it gets and how clear the sound is. I can have the speaker on in the bedroom and still hear it crystal clear in the kitchen which is about 100 feet away. I really like it because I only have to charge it about once a week. That's with playing music everyday for about 4-5 hours a day. We liked this one so much that we bought another one. It wasn't the same series as the first one, but almost identical. The quality on both are pretty good for the price that you pay. I would say the only down side with this speaker is that once it drops below a certain percentage (I think it's 50 percent) it doesn't produce as much sound as it would if it were fully charged. Not too big of a draw back, though. All together, I'd say that for the price you pay, this is a pretty awesome little speaker.",4,1,2018-7-19,1,0,0
"I've purchased two of these now. They work great as a boost for my phone audio without being overpowering. I like using it for my laptop too when I want a boost of sound in bed without wearing headphones/sharing something. I tried it in the car for audio and it's okay, but I did have a weird time syncing up the bluetooth with my Moto X Pure, might have been operator error though. I maybe needed to disconnect it from my laptop in order to sync it to my phone in the car? Not sure, either way I ended up having to use the AUX cable while using in the car. This sync issue does make me wonder about the hands free capability with phone calls. It's not a huge issue for me personally though. The cooks in the back have enjoyed being able to plug their phones into it while getting a nice boost of sound without disturbing the front of house and customers who are listening to the sound system up front. We used to use a big boom box BOH and this created a big sound clash with the FOH music, but this thing offers a nice sound without being overpowering. Perfect for its intended purpose.",5,1,2016-10-23,1,0,0
"Sounds amazing and easy to use.I am Canadian and travel from Canada to Florida a few times a year by car.  I purchased the speaker and received it on October 9th in Florida.  I used it a couple of days and while I had my hands full of stuff and trying to get in the car, I threw everything on the passenger seat.  A few hours after reaching the apartment we were renting, I realized I couldn’t find the speaker.  I could not remember if I brought it in the apartment or left it in the car.  I went back to the car, searched everywhere.  Nothing.  I went back to the apartment, searched everywhere, still nothing.  After looking for it for a few hours, I concluded that it was lost.  We drove back to Canada.  Three days of highways, sun and rain.  While in Canada, temperature went well below freezing for a few weeks with sporadic snow fall.  Two days ago (November 23rd), as I was putting stuff on the roof rack, I found, wedged under the rack, the speaker in its neoprene envelop.  I could not believe it; 43 days outside, in rain on highways, with snow fall and overall bad weather, the speaker was still there.  Water got in the envelop since the instruction booklet was wet and starting to grow mold.  I charged it and turned it back on.  It hadn’t lost any of its quality.  It is still working extremely well.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"What a nice little unit!  I've been a fan of Cambridge Sound Works' products for years. When I began looking for a Bluetooth speaker, I wanted something small and portable, with good sound, and a design that stood out. I found all of that, plus Cambridge Sounds Works quality, in this speaker. I set in on a shelf in the kitchen to provide a soundtrack while I play amateur chef, and then for musical accompaniment during dinner. It's also good to have out back while I'm grilling, or just kicking back on the patio. I've got a Galaxy S10 phone with one terabyte of storage, so my whole musical library is at my fingertips... plus music streaming services. It all sounds great, playing through this Oontz Angle 3 speaker.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

"This compact speaker does a nice job of transmitting music from my android. It has adequate bass to reproduce low concert organ notes that the phone does not. Vocal music also has better overall harmonic reproduction with no added distortion. It is cute, compact, and evidently, waterproof. It can be positioned vertically or horizontally.",5,1,2019-9-5,1,1,0
"We bought this speaker to help hear music while in the shower, as well as to listen to music together on an occasional small trips. It really packs a punch for such a small speaker, the sound goes very loud and you can hear some bass too. If it's quiet it may be that the phone volume needs adjusting or the original media itself is just recorded quiet because this thing goes loud. It picks up on the Bluetooth quick every time. While I recommend avoiding water if possible, it seems to do just fine getting splashed in the shower sitting on the tub edge. The charge is nice too, only issue is I never know how charged it is, so when in doubt plug it in. I've never ran out of battery after using it for about an hour or so every day, I just plug it in around the 7th day of using it.",4,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"Annoyed and disappointed in this product.. I wanted to upgrade my current portable speaker, the Amazon Basics Speaker, and assumed this would be better due to price and reviews; but in reality the sound is not loud enough, sound quality is tinny compared to the Amazon Speaker. In some ways it is better due to design, build, and it was water-proof, but who is going to use this in a swimming pool / beach when the sound barely gets loud enough for my living room?EDIT: had to fix up this review - actually it's only quiet when you connect with the audio cable. I tried this thing again with bluetooth+smartphone and it's actually insanely loud and clear, I use it in the gym at my campus everyone all around can hear. Amazing!",5,1,2018-3-25,1,0,0
"Its been a few months and the Oontz has failed me. I can't tell if it can't hold a charge or won't stay connected to my phone. When I plug it in the light shows that its charging.

I don't write many reviews but this speaker got my attention. I leave a bluetooth speaker hooked up in the bathroom and plugged in. Many of the speakers require a speaker repair or at least have to be turned back on and off again to start the pairing process. This angle speaker either stays paired repairs or worst case it only requires you to tell your mobile device to repair with the speaker. The speaker never needs touched. I have 250.00 bluetooth speakers that don't stay paired! I give it 4 stars because although the sound is good it's not loud enough for me to take along in the diesel trucks and hear easily. I don't hear the best but if it was just a little louder I'd give it 5 starts but I am really happy with it!.,4,1,2017-5-10,1,1,0
"I have been using this little guy for a few months now and all the perks and quirks that came along proved to be more useful than I initially thought they could be.Bluetooth connection ― I have a rather small room with minimal space so I usually let it stands up straight, that's not to say it doesn't do well in spacious environment. It's rather good in that aspect. In addition, it fits in even the smallest corner of my usual busy work station or high up on a shelf chocked full of books and still create crispy sounds with little to no disruptions. Walls may be a problem but that's understandable. The best way is to put the guy in the same room or same space with the source and it could easily go on and on without annoying interference.",4,1,2018-1-15,1,1,1
Got this for my laptop cuz for some reason my boom speaker witch is better but 30 more .... does not connect good this on the other hand pairs right up .. I have the smaller one witch is great for the price but wanted one a little bigger and I should of got the higher end one .. don’t get me wrong this is good but not that much power over the smaller one ..... but for the price and everything else that i tried this is the best Sounding one,5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"This little thing is awesome! Even got recognized on a float trip a couple times by people who also loved theirs. The sound is really impressive for the tiny size and the price point made me not stress about dumping it in the river on accident. Power and charging ports cover with a rubber flap to keep it water resistant and although we didn't test it, I was confident about its water resistance and durability. Lasted all day on high volume and pairs easily with my iPhone however it would un-pair when it went to sleep between listening, which was great for battery life but I kinda got tired of getting my phone out in the boat to re-pair the device. Not bad enough to change my review though. Stays connected over a great distance too.",5,1,2017-8-3,1,1,0
"I just bought a used Acer laptop and can't say I'm surprised that the built in speakers get more anemic with every new model of laptop.

Pull up Bless It's Pointed Little Head by Jefferson Airplane and dial in Three Fifths of a Mile In Ten Seconds.  Jack Casady's bass will jump up and grab you by the throat.  Grace Slick's vocals drill right down to your brain stem the way they used to when we were all taking acid.No, you won't host a neighborhood block hip hop event with this little guy, it just sits it's little rubberized butt on the desk and let's you know you still understand what rock and roll is.",5,1,2017-11-17,1,0,0

"This is my second Oontz speaker, it's pretty darn loud for a tiny speaker this size and it goes on for a while with a full charge. My laptop and tablets have piss-poor sound quality and this little speaker comes to the rescue! I've bought other speakers from bestbuy store brand and while the other speaker is loud, it is not clear. This one is not just louder but also crisp, does not degrade sound at higher volumes. I take this everywhere, place this on my Civic's dash and the silicone ""feet"" or whatever you want to call it keep it secure and I can listen to my music and for phone calls since my car doesn't have bluetooth this does just nice.

"I use this mainly for my car because the speakers in my car isn't that good. The Oontz Angle 3 does its job, it can be loud depending how high you increase the volume (just adjust volume) and I can definitely hear people CLEARLY with the Oontz Angle speaker via Bluetooth. Of course it's not the best sounding quality but I just needed a portable speaker that I can hear my music and people on the phone clearly. It was decent for its price. I don't feel like dropping $150-200 for portable speakers just yet. I'm just looking for temporary speaker that will serve its purpose, so I decided to buy this one and I'm completely fine with it.",4,1,2017-11-25,1,1,0

This little speaker has so much punch. It's plenty loud. I wish it had more bass, but for the price I rally can not complain! I use my cellphone charger to charge it up when it dies and even on the charger it can still keep playing music.

"Great little unit for sitting around the campfire, out on the deck or for partying in the camper. Gets plenty loud enough for my needs (we do want to still be able to talk with friends while this plays in the background). Battery charges quickly and will probably outlast the battery in my phone, though I haven't done a full charge-to-depletion test yet. I don't use the bluetooth sync feature because that eats up battery reserves far more quickly than hard-wiring. So, I just plug a short cable from the phone directly into the input jack of this and I get more playing time than I've ever needed. Placement can make a big difference in output tone. Tuck it into a corner of some sort to greatly augment bass response, or stand it on its end to highlight mids and highs instead. I have zero expectations of this outperforming units twice as big, twice as sophisticated or twice as expensive, so if you just want a nice, compact unit that will sound leaps and bounds better than any phone speaker ever will, this is a great alternative.",5,1,2016-10-24,1,0,0

However, the color that I ordered is not the one that pairs with an additional speaker. I ordered two of them specifically for that purpose.

Finally, it had to be the Oontz unit. So, since it was quite good, when it worked, I bought another one. I also cut out, the same as the old one. Different cables no help. If I did not unplug the audio cable but forcefully pushed it in the sound would return for a few evenings but eventually the issue re-occurred. Oh well it is, after-all, Amazon.",4,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0

"It seems like a great little speaker, and good value for the money, easy to pair, good battery life, easy controls, sensible indicator lights, and decent sound for the size.But. It hisses when plugged into USB for charging and using a 3.5mm audio cable instead of Bluetooth. A pretty serious hiss. Their troubleshooting site mentions this issue (a ground loop). Maybe charging it from a dedicated USB wall charger would help. I require a 3.5mm audio cable because I don't want to use bluetooth for certain applications and view audio cable connectivity as a feature, and think it reasonable to want to charge the device at the same time as I listen to it.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
We bought this because our other speaker not broken it does have decent sound however the battery life is not what they listed for it only lasts about 2 hours not even full volume . The Bluetooth can be a bit tricky sometimes it doesn't want to disconnect from one to reconnect to another we try using it on both our iPhone or Samsung phone and a Amazon Fire tablet sometimes we just can't get it to disconnect from one and reconnect to the other,4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Used this speaker to replace my bedroom TV speaker in order to not annoy neighbors. My TV is kind of far away from the head of my bed and has an extremely broad dynamic range or whatever you call it when quiet sounds are really quiet and loud sounds are really loud.Anyways, I thought I was getting a ""cheap"" speaker just to test out how to hook things up and everything, but am so happy with the size, sound quality, and battery life, I am going to just stick with this one. If I ever need another bluetooth speaker, I am going to just buy another one of these.",5,1,2019-4-6,1,0,0
"The bluetooth connection on this device is horrible. Audio occasionally skips when listening to music and audio from video is delayed 100% of the time. There is no fix to this. I have tried multiple bluetooth adapters and and sure that battery is not an issue.When the speaker is working for music, i think that it sounds pretty good. For the price this speaker would have been a great buy for the price however the iffy bluetooth and audio delay is not worth it. I would buy a different speaker.",2,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"5 STARS all the WAY!! I've bought more than one blue tooth speaker looking for one that actually worked the way they say. THIS IS THE ONE!!....I love this unit.....the shape works great! the controls are double cool and very, very easy to use and work great. The sound isn't the same a a multi hundred'$ of league but really very, very good.  I would recommend this unit to anybody, in fact I'm going to buy another one for to use in my office.So: great sound, super easy to use, .....I love it!  You can't go wrong with this unit especially for $27.00 .....!!  I've paid much more for units that weren't 1/3rd of the quality.",5,1,2017-1-19,1,2,0
"I love using this speaker in my shower (above the door frame) and in the mornings when I'm getting ready for school/work. I've had it for about two months and I haven't had to charge it yet - given that I use it every day for roughly 10 - 30 minutes a day. It took a hot minute for me to get it connected the first time, but has since automatically connected to my phone once I turn it on. The sound quality is nice and it does get very loud.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"I love this Bluetooth speaker! I bought it back in October 2016. The sound quality is great and the speaker is very easy to use/connect to. I was looking for an affordable, good quality Bluetooth speaker with decent bass and came across the Oontz Angle. Friends and family of mine have bought Oontz and love it. More recently (November 2019), my speaker’s sound started “rattling” in the background so I think that is the end of my Oontz Angle 3’s life. I’ve used it almost daily, mostly listening to music, since I bought the speaker. I’m so impressed with the Oontz Angle 3 that I will be upgrading to the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra.Also I read about some charging issues. I did have some charging issues as well but my problem was the charging wire, not the speaker. It doesn’t seem the charging wire that comes with the speaker is very durable but it is a standard charging wire and I had another one laying around that worked perfectly.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Sometimes Apple is an innovator and sometimes they are idiots. In the iMac's case, they are idiots. The speaker is on the BACK when there is a good 2"" tall, screen-wide silver bar facing the user that would have been a better place for it. This speaker fits under the screen and faces the user. I mostly listen to talk radio and these speakers do not have a deep base so it suites my needs. Definitely a great buy.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,1,0
"I love this little speaker. The sound is great and the battery life is amazing. But... BUT... there is a major flaw in its design and that is the USB charing port. I don't know if it's fragile, poorly designed, or requires the specific USB cable that comes with the speaker to be charged correctly (which would be a very limiting requirement). The first one of these I bought lasted a couple years before the charging port failed. It would still charge, but I had to twist and bend the cable and angle it just so to get it to work. The most recent purchase of the speaker lasted only a matter of months before the port failed.Like I said, the performance of the speaker is the best I have encountered for such a great price point, but now that I've had two speakers fail in the exact same way makes me very wary about purchasing another.",2,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
"I'm not one to demand the most impressive sound quality and usually I can't tell much difference among the mainstream current speakers. That said, I did think the Angle had impressive sound for such a small and low cost speaker. On average, I used it about 3 times per week for about 1-3 hours at a time. I never had a problem with battery depletion although I usually plugged it in after a couple uses. It paired easily with my laptop and multiple different phones. Then the other day there was a sudden pop sound and it stopped working. It won't even turn on. I checked the warranty and it expired at 3 months. We've bought a few others from Anker and they've lasted at least 3 years and counting so I'll go back to that brand from now on.",3,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

"While this is an improvement over a tabletop tv speaker slightly, there is no bass to this speaker. Speech is clearer than the tv speaker.  So if you're looking for a low cost alternative to the similarly sized Bose speaker, there is no comparison.  If you enjoy music, you'll have to spend a bit more to get any depth and bass.  I was expecting a little more from Cambridge Soundworks and I'm surprised by all the positive reviews.",3,1,2018-12-3,1,1,0
"This is my second Oontz Angle, the first one lasted 3 years before it died. I love the speaker, so I ordered this one again. The quality of the sound is great with Music or Movies. The bluetooth connects fast on either tv, pc, phone, etc and the Oontz has a connection to connect it directly to your device if it does not have bluetooth. The unit feels and looks like great quality. There are no cables included, but any standard android type c charge cable is all you need. The unit times out after a set period of time with no sound input to save battery time. Great little speaker at a great price.",5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
I wasn't looking to spend too much on a speaker a year ago when I bought this. I didn't want to leave a review right away just because I see a lot of them that say that it fails to charge and the sound gets distorted after a while.I cannot be any happier with my purchase. The sound that it puts out is pretty good for the price that you pay for it! I keep the speaker in the bathroom as I'm one of those people who has to listen to music so I can sing in the shower lol.,5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
It has been 3 years since I bought this speaker and I have to say it has been the best speaker I have ever bought.It has never lost connection and that is with me walking a good distance away from it.  I can make it a good 200ft and still hear the music playing.,5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
The whole triangle design is something new. But I wasn't sure if I'd like it but I really do like it the buttons are easy to use having the volume up and volume down I like that it has two ports one to charge it and then one with a 3.5 mm audio jack plus it has a Bluetooth capability. also the sound is amazing and it goes up really loud and you can turn it down really low and still here it clearly without it crackling. definitely worth the money the one I bought before I am returning I was waiting on a new one I'm so glad that I bought this one!,5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
I love this little guy!  I take mine when traveling or when I'm working in the garage.  It offers much better sound quality than my iPad or my phone so I'll use it to watch videos.  It's especially convenient when watching instructional videos while you follow along.  I'll be taking it on a hunting trip to use with animal calls on my phone.  Battery life is great.  It's compact but gives good quality sound for such a small speaker.  You're not going to rock a party with it but it's great for a midsize room.  I liked it so much I bought 3 more of them as gifts.,5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
"I have only had this a few days, but upon opening the box I was already impressed. I love the matte-black color and the design. I plugged it in to charge and it already had over half a battery - so I was pleased I wouldn't have to wait for it to charge too long to start using it. It paired with my phone seamlessly and once I started playing the first song - WOW! This small speaker really packs a punch! I bought it to use in the shower and on our patio when we have people over. I can't speak to battery life yet, but so far I'm very impressed! Great price too so even better!",5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
"the battery had to be charged often, the bluetooth had to be within 15 feet of my laptop and the unit died a week after the warranty ran out.

This unit has loud Volume & Bass and 100 Foot Wireless Range, IPX5, Bluetooth is excellent allowing me to take it to my basement without having to take the laptop with me. I can also leave the laptop in the house while I work outside. A wiser choice.",1,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"Bought this speaker to take with me to vacation and ended up using it everywhere else(pool side, shower, cleaning house). They are quite loud and very cheap.

Accidentally dropped in my pool and it still works as it jsut came out of the box!Pros:",4,1,2017-4-28,1,2,0
"The only reason I don’t give this 5 stars is because I actually bought 2 of these and 1 stopped charging, and therefore quit working, after about 6 months. It worked great leading up to that, and it isn’t a terrible price for the time we got to use it. It might of been a lemon. I would buy again, probably. I did, in fact. We bought one for our kid and liked it so much we bought another just a short time after. It’s just a bummer that one just quit working.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"It's no Bose, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've dropped it a few times and no ill effects. I don't use the bluetooth. I use the jack and plug it into my Kindle Fire to save battery life. Not sure if the fault is in the wire or the jack, but sometimes the connection doesn't quite hold and the sound drops half of its lead, like losing a speaker when there's two. Usually a wiggle and a push fixes it, but that's annoying when you're in the middle of a workout and don't want to stop what you're doing to fix your sound system. Bluetooth would probably eliminate this problem.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I was very skeptical at first, the pricing seemed like a gimmick.  (Paid $30 vs list of $100.)  Its performance delivers as promised though.

So pros .... sounds amazing for such a little speaker.  Has a long battery life . I would recommend this speaker.  The price is good too.Cons... just a few minute issues .. the bluetooth gets disconnected often and we have to reconnect no biggie..  the only thing I can complain about is every once in a while the speaker will get some feedback and you hear crackling if turned up too high .

"Over a week ago, my original review was as follows (scroll down to see my UPDATED review):""I was looking for a cheap, portable speaker that is also works with an aux input (for my MP3 player).

My brother already has one it's been 2 years and it's still perfect as a new one. The sound is very good, the battery lasts forever, the connection is very good too, waterproof, good size. Perfect!

"I researched small Bluetooth Speakers pretty extensively before I bought this Oontz Angle. I have to say it really is living up to the rave reviews I read. The sound that comes out of this compact little speaker is UNBELEIVABLE! It is really loud, the bass is solid, the highs are super crisp even when turned to maximum volume.The range from the device to the speaker is really good. I have had it playing on the opposite side of the house from my iPhone with no problems. To test it... I set it on a table in the back of my garage and walked two houses down with my phone and it was still playing clearly. I chose this speaker mainly because it has two 5 watt speakers, unlike the others I found in it's price range with only one 8 watt or one 5 watt speaker that were also water resistant... and they are all seriously expensive. The battery life is also excellent, and there is no annoying voice confirming the connection when you pair it like other speakers I have had, it just makes a cute little ""bling"" sound. The only thing about it is when you want to switch devices, you have to turn off bluetooth so that it un-pairs before pairing it to a different device (no big deal though- that's typical). My brother who lives with me is buying one for himself too after seeing and hearing mine. I waited a couple of months to review it just incase it had issues- I am happy to say...none so far. This product is ROCK SOLID!!! Great buy :)",5,1,2016-5-18,1,0,0
"I just received this yesterday and it is absolutely amazing! I wanted a Bluetooth speaker and bought this one based on all of the great reviews and I am sure glad I did. The sound is unbelievable from such a small speaker. I will be using this mostly while working in the garage or while taking a shower.. but I found another cool use for it yesterday while playing with it.. I watched Indiana Jones on my Kindle Fire HD with this speaker hooked up to it.. It sounded awesome!!  Sounds so much better than the stock speakers, great if two people are watching together. If you need a Bluetooth speaker I highly recommend this one!",5,1,2017-1-11,1,2,0
"Bought my second unit. My daughter took the first one when she headed off for college. Still solid choice. Highly recommend.Solid packaging. Arrived pre-charged. Pairing is a piece of cake. Paired easily with kindle, Samsung phone and hp pc.  Sound is clear, crisp and surprisingly loud with no distortion. When playing, sometimes loses sound for a moment. Not sure why.  Doesn't last long. Pause/play, volume and power controls. Could use a forward (skip) button. Good looking unit. Unit is small and extremely solid. 3 sided design is versatile. Set flat, set on end. Fits in auto cup holder. Haven't tried the speaker phone function yet. I definitely recommend this product. You can't do better for under $30.",5,1,2017-3-16,1,1,0
"Upon receiving the package my initial thought was this thing is massive, but after opening the Amazon box, and getting past the air sacs I pulled out a smaller box. ""What the hell is this small thing?"" I did not think that I ordered a mini speaker I was hoping for something with more substance, something that could fill an entire room with my music. I proceeded to open the package and this bizarre prism shaped thing was in my hands, throwing aside the instruction manual, I proceeded to turn on the speaker, paired it easily with my iPhone, and was disappointed with how quiet my music was playing. I did a few things wrong, first my iPhone's volume was low, I turnt it up and now we were in business, but the bass was still disappointing. I had the speaker standing vertically, I placed it so the base of the triangle was down, after noticing the rubber guards. The bass improved, but still not quite what I was hoping, not enough bass, Meghan Trainor was sounding a little flat, I noticed the plus sign on the side of the Oontz and the volume started going up again and the bass was starting to rumble. We are in business! Over the last week of owning this device I've been very impressed, it is most definitely able to fill any room you want, depending on acoustics. I use this daily while showering, it is waterproof, but I noticed the bass was not as strong on porcelain surfaces, so I placed it on the counter where there is a wood surface and it seems to improve it. Friends and family members are asking about it, and when I tell them the price 4 of them have already ordered one. Battery life has been great, I still have not needed to charge the device out of the box and it has had an active time of ~6 hours. Connecting is a breeze, it has auxiliary input, charged with a micro usb cable which are hidden behind a rubber guard, I don't think aux can be used while near water though. I was really surprised at the amount of sound this thing can generate. Granted it's not going to be full range, I think the midline is diminished and upper ends are a little higher than they should be, I'm too lazy to try to adjust the equalizer in my phone. But if you are just wanting something to play music from time to time, and are going to be near water, you could drop $200 easily on a Bose, or drop less than $40 and slightly compromise sound quality. I don't use the built in microphone so I can't really tell you how well it works, but Siri does not respond from the speaker. Definitely would recommend, unless you are a seriously anal audiophile.",5,1,2016-1-21,1,0,0
This is a solid speaker and one of the better speakers available at this price point. Before you continue with this review this unit will not sound like a 200 Bose or equivalent high end Bluetooth speaker. Things I like- Pairs instantly with my phone once I turn it on. My brand new car's bluetooth can not even do this.,5,1,2017-6-25,1,1,0
"I really enjoy listening to music when I grill outside.  Prior to purchasing this speaker, I would have to connect my laptop to my stereo and then position my speakers near a window that I would leave open so I could hear the music.  This wasn't ideal for the hotter months that require the AC to be on.  I decided it was time to try out a bluetooth speaker.  I didn't want to spend a lot and I was hoping to achieve a slightly better audio quality than what I would get from my phone's speaker.  The Oontz Angle 3 provided a much better audio experience than I expected.  The audio quality stayed superb even after I cranked the volume all the way up.  Steely Dan, A Tribe Called Quest, Pet Shop Boys... everything I threw at this speaker sounded great.  My Android phone running Lollipop had no issue finding and syncing to the speaker.  The volume controls on the speaker worked perfectly along with the pause/play button.  I have yet to try out the microphone on the speaker for calls as this is a feature I don't really plan on using.  The speaker is lightweight, feels like it's sturdy and seems like it should be ok in somewhat moist environments.",5,1,2016-6-9,1,0,0
"I am pretty blown away with this little guy.  It sounds MUCH bigger than it is.  Very clear sound with nice midrange  and highs.  Used it outdoors by its little lonesome at a party last weekend and actually had to turn it down to a level everybody could talk.  It just rocks.  I used it six hours one stretch and it did not deplete the battery, so I'd say battery life is good.  Bluetooth pairs instantly and effortlessly.  A great product.  No, I'm not getting anything for this review.  :-)  If you want a very small and portable  Bluetooth speaker system, I recommend this one highly.",5,1,2019-4-3,1,0,0

"I ordered this speaker because I don't have one in my new place and wanted something cheap but effective. Reviews are excellent so I decided to take a leap of faith: I'm not disappointed at all; quite the opposite actually. Great sound, loud and crisp (as loud and crisp as you could expect from a $30 Bluetooth speaker). It's small and practical but it packs a punch. Lights up with a pretty cool white/blue interface and it's extremely easy to use. Battery life goes from 9-12 hours, which is actually impressive. I've also tried it with phone calls and it does work like a charm. Basically, if you want a speaker for your parties/reunions or even just for yourself this thing surely does the trick and it's $30.",5,1,2017-4-24,1,1,0
"The best bang for your buck! I challenge you to find a louder speaker with all the same features for less. I have bought several of these over the past few years along with their official case to keep them clean. Only complaint I have is Bluetooth connectivity. Sometimes it will auto connect as it should (after the first time). Other times it will not pair and I have to ""forget this device"" for the speaker and refresh my BT devices to connect. Not a big deal but slightly annoying when you just want to listen right away. Battery life lasts a long time, plays very loud and usually louder than you would need for a speaker of that size. It's water resistant so you can play it in your bathroom although I keep it away from water just in case. Stop reading and hit that add to cart button!",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0

The volume on my iPad isn't conducive to listening to music while on long trips.  I had hoped for good results with other speakers (the kind that plug in) and found them sorely lacking.  I read the many complimentary reviews for this product and decided to give it a try.  Wow, we were blown away this weekend as we traveled about town.  We were able to enjoy our favorite music on Pandora without any problems, why, at times it was too loud.  That hasn't happened before!!!  I cannot say enough good things about this little gem.",5,1,2017-7-10,1,1,0
"I bought this to replace a speaker from a different brand that was very disappointing and broke. First of all, the battery life of this is real! I used it for 2 shifts at work and it didn't die.  It wasn't playing constantly,  but most of the time and my other speaker would die after 4-6hrs.  If I could say it lacks anything,  I would say it could use more bass.  But given it's size and price point,  I am very pleased. I work in a cold/frozen environment and it holds up just fine.",5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"For under $30, you will be hard pressed to find a better bluetooth device. This unit puts out quite good, strong sound for such a compact unit. It was originally purchased as a shower speaker, but has turned into my go to BT speaker. I really enjoy the fact that it will turn off if the BT connection is not active, which saves battery life. The battery powers this speaker for a long time depending on the sound level. I would say it should be okay for at least 5 hours on full blast. My only minor complaint is that there aren't forward/back buttons on the speaker itself. Aside from that, I am very impressed with this speaker. I would recommend this to anyone with a tight budget who needs a speaker for the shower, travel, dorm,  office, etc.Update June 2019: I had to update the review just to add that my family has used this on a weekly basis, it has served through countless showers, poolside or on the beach, camping/ traveling for the past few years. This is truly a great product for the price and it's more than held up to everything we've thrown at it. I has little signs of wear and tear and the battery life is amazing. I see there's a deal right now for around $20, so I'll probably purchase another one. For the price I think this particular speaker at this price is the best bang for your buck. .",5,1,2016-4-24,1,0,1
"It is a great sounding speaker! Best I've ever heard so far. Problem is it's supposed to turn off after the Music Stops after 15 minutes. Somehow it works the opposite and I will be in the shower and after three songs, it turns off. And if I'm lucky, I can press the pause button and it will start again. If not it goes into Bluetooth mode. There are definitely better speakers out there. Would not really recommend this one.",3,1,2018-12-12,1,1,0
"Now let me give this the best review. If you’re thinking about purchasing this i would definitely do it. I received it april 2nd, 2017 and i still use it to this day. It is the only speaker i’ve ever bought and use. I have dropped it in the shower and it did stop working for a day but then it worked the next time i turned it on and sounded perfect as if nothing happened. It is splash proof and does do well in the rain. All the claims it has is 100% true. I love this speaker and would DEFINITELY buy again when mine stops working. The battery life does last a long time i play songs on it for about 45 minutes to an hour a day and the battery won’t get low until a week or so. This is one of the best bluetooth speakers i’ve tried",5,1,2019-4-2,1,1,0
"This little speaker has some serious kick. For the price and the size this speaker has quite a lot of sound. I take it to the beach and blast it while I throw the frisbee around, in the shower while I'm washing and splashing water all over it, and while I'm entertaining. I used to own a $200 JBL that sounded exactly the same. For the price this is a steal. I've had it for a year and I'm so happy I got it. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a big bass-ey bluetooth, but there isn't a better BT speaker on the market at this price.",5,1,2019-1-16,1,1,0
I have had three of these and all of them fail to stream music without stuttering. Once the stutters begin it is the end of life for the speaker.  All of them failed after a few months.  It's not my phone because I have had a different phone each time I replaced the speaker.  It's not the way I'm using the Bluetooth because the Bluetooth receiver connected to my living room stereo functions without issue.  I'm going to buy a Beats because I'm tired of being let down by this item.,1,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0

"I have used this speaker since 2016 without issues. I am a long-time customer of Cambridge SoundWorks, previously with their PC desktop speakers. The reason I am writing this review over 3 years later is because I recently lost my Oontz Angle. I ended up purchasing a replacement (Oontz 3XL Ultra) because I finally gave up hope of finding the lost one.Well, 2 days ago I found it. It was wedged underneath the ski rack on the top of my car. It was covered and mud and soaking wet. It has been up there for over a month. During that month I have gone to National Parks and went backpacking on trailheads that require a 20 mile drive down a dirt road to reach.  It has rained several times and temperatures have been in the teens at night. The Oontz has been on the top of my car for all of it.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"I wanted a cheap but quality Bluetooth speaker, so after much research I purchased this speaker due to the amount of quality feedback and ratings. I expected it to be pretty decent but this little thing surpassed my expectations. My iPhone and my S7 pair to it with zero issues. The battery life is very long, jammed it for around 6 hours one night on a single charge and still had half a battery. Sound is superb, crisp and clear, no distortion and had all ranges to include decent bass. This speaker also gets surprisingly loud for its size and the quality of sound is not hindered even atax volume. I have recommended this to my friends and family and will be purchasing another as a gift. Great product, it's built well and is very rugged.",5,1,2018-1-21,1,0,0
Great product. My normal issue with Bluetooth speakers in volume and sound quality. If you turn it up loud the sound quality is crappy. This one is great. Gets pretty darn loud for a little speaker.,5,1,2019-8-29,1,2,0
"I originally purchased the OontZ Angle 3 because I wanted a good quality portable Bluetooth speaker, but I didn’t want to break the bank. When compared to name brand Bluetooth speakers such as Bose and Beats by Dr. Dre, this is a steal. This is an ideal Bluetooth speaker for anyone who is budget conscious, but wants good sound quality, a cool design, and long battery-life.Impressive Features:",4,1,2017-9-15,1,2,0
"I loved this little speaker - it has great sound, nice and loud, no problems with bluetooth connection, etc. We used it outside to play music from our iThings. I dinged the review one star because after two years I started getting static/disruption in the sound and can only assume the speaker is failing. I suppose two years is not terrible for today's products, but man oh man do I hate filling the landfills with this kind of stuff.",4,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"The overall sound quality is decent and it’s plenty loud for a small apartment or dorm room.  Overall 3 stars though because the bass is lacking, even from a divice of this size.  For the $$ it’s a solid buy for a Bluetooth speaker but with a name that mirrors the sound we all make to reflect thumps in the club... it could do with a little more low end.",3,1,2019-1-14,1,2,0
"This is a nice small compact speaker that suits my needs and space well.  Because I don't move it around, I have it plugged into an AC outlet so not sure how long the battery lasts.  The Bluetooth was super easy to pair with my iPhone, and the volume can be controlled using the + and - buttons on the unit or from my iPhone.  It has nice weight to it and won't tip easily (I use it vertically) and the sound is very clear for the small room I use it in.  Would definitely buy again.",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I have had this speaker for nearly 3 years and it has served me well, I used it at home, in the car, on the boat (in a cabin), at work and for small seminars/social gatherings.This speaker has long battery life and automatically turns off if not in use for some time to preserve battery life, it is loud for a suitable size room or cubicle. Also has a built in speaker which I found out about today trying to connect to a Zoom conference call; three (3) years later! LOL",5,1,2017-10-13,1,0,0
(Watch attached video) We got this for our workplace. We took it out of the box and set it. The speaker volume was perfect. Halfway through the first song it started “jumping” or “skipping”.  We tried different phones connected to it. We tried from amazon music and YouTube. With wifi without WiFi. Nope it just pooped out and didn’t work. I’m sending back. Not replacing. Just getting money back.,1,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"Use it with my 10"" tablet.  No more stupid headphones.  Sounds great with Movies and Music.  I just set it anywhere and take my tablet all over the house and it still sounds good 30 feet away.  Great PRICE.  Better than I expected.  9-4-20  Update........................Lasted about 8 months.  Volume is down to almost nothing.  Have to put it next to my head to hear it.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  Only 90 day warranty.  Make sure you get extended warranty if you are going to buy.  I just looked at item on Amazon and could find no mention of 90 day warranty.  I had to go to their website to find out it is only 90 days.  Nothing like being transparent to the consumer.  Will never buy another of any of their products.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I rarely write reviews - if ever. So the fact that I'm writing one for a regular ol' speaker like this speaks volumes (pun intended).Sound quality: It is very clear, able to reproduce voices with the upmost clarity. Highs and mids are very pronounced, without being too overpowering. Bass is... somewhat disappointing.  Don't let the ""Rich Bass"", or ""passive bass radiator"" fool you. While there is enough to notice the low ends, this speaker cannot produce the thump or thundering lows that some people might be used to. If that is important to you, don't get this speaker. Otherwise, if you prefer more attention in the highs and mids, this speaker will please you. Overall, this speaker delivers decent, fairly balanced sound.",4,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0
"This is an updated version of the original OontZ Angle Bluetooth speaker, but with the additional feature of being splash-proof. Like the original, it provides nice sound when linked to your phone, iPod, or other Bluetooth device. The water resistance is due to covering the buttons and ends with a somewhat hard plastic coating to prevent moisture intrusion; it's not meant to allow the speaker to be submerged.Performance-wise, it's the same as my other, Original, OoontZ. Bluetooth setup is the same as are the various controls for synching, volume, and track selection. Also like the original, charging is via a mini-USB jack plugged into any USB power source such as your computer. The jack appears to be sealed also.",5,1,2016-1-1,1,0,0
"Great device! My only complaint is that if I have my notification volume on, any time I get a notification and it comes across the speaker, my speaker will turn down the music one or two notches (yet it will still be full volume on my phone). Sometimes it will just turn down the music randomly anyway. Full battery, no one touching it, etc.The device can get quite loud. Loud enough to fill the house, but the volume turns down on itself if its at full volume on the speaker for too long (even if your phones volume is turned down some).",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I purchased this speaker in May 2019 and have used it in my office which is (obviously) free from excessive moisture. Roughly three months ago, I noticed the charging port was becoming increasingly difficult to use, as in, I had to wiggle and position the charging cord in odd ways to get the device to charge. About a week ago it stopped accepting a charge completely. I have tried multiple charging cables (Anker, Aukey, and the included cable) with no success. I have since purchased another brand of speaker as this one is now useless due to a dead battery and no way to replenish teh battery.",1,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
When the speakers work they worked great. Great sound quality and it connected via bluetooth fairly consistently. My main gripe with this speaker is that I've gone through two of these speakers within 2 years. It seems that after a year and a half of use the speaker starts to break down and the audio will crackle. Both my speakers had this same problem. So despite the excellent performance I can't give a great rating given the short lifespan of these speakers.,3,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"OK, it made it two years. But, all it did was sit on a bookshelf and played low volume music in my study for perhaps 4-hours a day. Never outside, never dropped or mishandled. Just sit still and play some music. Then suddenly the bluetooth stops working. OK, I can live with that, I'll connect it directly to my Echo dot. Good, now it works again. Two weeks later the speaker totally dies. Come on guys, it's a freaking speaker, it is not rocket science. Yes it was inexpensive to purchase, but that is not a justification simply failing.",1,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
I bought this to provide background music at open houses. It was perfect. The sound quality was clear and sounded like a much bigger speaker. It was very easy to use and paired immediately with my phone. I could not get it to pair with my MacBook but that's probably a Mac problem.  Also I  haven't used it at top volume yet but I suspect it will be fine. All in all plays as well as my old Bose iPod speaker.,5,1,2019-8-24,1,1,0
"My cousin gave me an echo dot a few months ago and all I've used it for was checking the weather or asking questions. There were times when I would have it play my Pandora stations. It was doing one of those times when my wife stated that it would be nice to have it play outside on the patio. It was then that I began looking for a Bluetooth speaker. I chose the Oontz Angle 3, based on the price and previous reviews. I am well pleased with the Angle 3. The sound is great and for it's size it has a very good sounding base, we had it sitting on a glass tabletop and it had the glass vibrating. We recently had a pool party and the range and sound of the music had some of our guests asking questions about the Angle 3. My sister told me as she was leaving that she was ordering one when she got home.",5,1,2017-8-2,1,0,0
"This little speaker is awesome! I was looking for a decent quality Bluetooth speaker that was small and durable to use around the house and outside. This is perfect. It connects to my laptop & phone easily, the music sounds great, and you just plug it in to recharge it instead of expensive and annoying batteries. Not only that, but it's really well-made and feels solid. I've left it outside in the rain and it still works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase!!",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Great sound, even at the high end.  Good solid construction.  The only drawbacks are that it takes FOREVER to recharge and the controls are so incredibly dark you can't even see them in a lit room.  You have to bring it up close to a light source to see the raised buttons.  One good thing about that is it improves your manual dexterity, like a blind man reading braille!",4,1,2019-3-26,1,1,0
"My wife's been listening to her fav music right off her phone while doing things around the house. I read the reviews on the OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Portable Speaker and considered getting it for her to use with her phone to listen to her fav music. I use the word ""consider"" because my wife is a bit technology-phobic. I decided to get the Oontz for her for Christmas. When it arrived I took advantage of my wife being out to fully charge (it arrived about 80% charge btw). A few days later while my wife was in the shower I pre-pair the OontZ via bluetooth to my wife's Samsung Note phone without a hitch and then wrapped the speaker and put it under the Christmas tree. Christmas morning my wife opened it looked at it apprehensively and wanted to know what she was supposed to do with it. I told her she could use it to listen to music from her phone, showed her the buttons she needed to push and crossed my fingers. The phone paired without a hitch and she loved the new sound. It's nearly a month later and she uses the speaker regularly and has yet to have a problem with the simple operation of the speaker. The only draw back is that I'm having to listed to her music all the time now :-{)]",5,1,2016-1-17,1,0,0
"Connects fast to BlueTooth device. The sound will NOT shake walls (and shouldn't based on size), but produces a clear balanced sound spectrum. All buttons work as expected and are logically placed. I have another BT sound tube, but prefer this guy that cost 1/3 the price. Seems to also keep a long charge. I charge a couple times a month and use daily for at least 3 - 5 hours. Very impressed! A great personal BT speaker, that I would recommend.",5,1,2019-9-3,1,1,0
I love how compact and loud this speaker gets and everything about the product is really quite fantastic. My first one lasted me a good few months but randomly died on me. The thing wouldn’t respond to power and I even attempted to reset it through the website’s instructions. I contacted their customer service via email and the wonderful representative sent me a replacement product without hassle and was hear within the week.My second product which arrived a few days ago worked great but the same thing happened after the third use.,1,1,2019-1-11,1,1,0
"I previously left a review discussing the quality of the sound and design of the speaker with only one complaint. My complaint was that the speaker sometimes sounded like I was listening to a scratched disk. Customer support saw my review and contacted me through email, suggesting that I had received a unit with bad firmware and that a replacement unit was on the way. A few days later I received the replacement unit and after making sure it was fully charged I put it to use. So far, after a couple days of use, I have not found any issues to report. The speaker is working great.In my original review I had mentioned that I do wish the speaker had a little more bass. However, I do realize that this is not a bass cannon and that I could perhaps use an equalizer to increase the bass. It's not that there isn't any bass, I just like a little more ""boom"" to my music. However, the overall sound quality is better than expected. The speakers don't sound cheap at all. The design is a perfect design. The shape and size of the speaker will allow the music to fill a room no matter where it is placed.  I use the speaker on average of 2-4 hours a day and the battery so far has lasted me five days. So far I have not had the battery die on me, I just recharge it at the end of the week. I would certainly recommend this item to any of my friends.",5,1,2016-2-13,1,0,0
"In spite of its small size, the bass response is phenomenal.  Granted, you won't feel the dubstep pounding your chest but you can actually discern the bass coming out of the unit clearly and audibly.  The volume is also much better than anticipated.  I have it paired with my Note 8 and an ASUS gaming laptop.  There is no apparent audio delay when watching videos like I experience when they are paired with my 2013 Equinox.  On the down side, I use the speaker in the ambulance where I work.  I am not certain of the exact sleep time for the speaker however it seems like 20 minutes.  If I step out of the ambulance with my phone in my pocket, go into a hospital, come back out 20 minutes later the speaker is in sleep mode.  That in and of it self should be a non-issue.  However, it can often take several attempts to achieve connectivity again.  Regardless, the device can go an entire 13+hour shift on a single charge and is well worth the current twenty something dollar asking price and even twice that!  If you were hesitating on purchasing, stop reading and click ""Buy Now"". You won't be disappointed.",4,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0
"This speaker was great until it stopped working after less than a year. It’s inexpensive and great quality for the price. I used it to teach my yoga classes so, it was used roughly 5 hours a week. I had it playing for a class and it started making a really loud static noise. I turned it off and now it won’t play anything. It turns on and connects no problem but, no sound comes out. I’m super disappointed because I really liked this speaker prior to it dying.",1,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0

"Just got it a few days ago.  Probably my first successful Bluetooth device, it set up quickly without R'ing the FM.  I used my phone as it was at hand, the sonic blast cleared me out of my seat.  I seem not to have used much battery, I tried to recharge it after a while but it was full as shipped.It is a real treat to stuff it in the pocket and do chores around the house, no signal issues.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"I am very happy with my OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) - Bluetooth Portable Speaker. It's small, but packs a punch. I do have some issues with the quality of sound, it is especially evident when music is played. It's nothing horrible; just goes in and out at times. Not a major problem, but noticeable. Overall, very pleased with the sound. Like others, would consider a second one to have more a ""surround sound"" effect.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I have had 3 of these. In each case it started out great. Then suddenly stopped completely. The company was very responsive, and sent me a new one-the first for a small charge, the next two free. The last stopped working very quickly, and I am just giving up. But thought I should comment for others.Something very strange just happened--I had it plugged in to charge and walked away to my computer.  As I was tapping a message on my phone, I heard the echo of my tapping from the speaker!  That never happened before.",1,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"It sounds quite good. There may not be quite the separation you'll find in far pricier speakers, but I was always a little worried about dropping north of a hundred dollars for something others could find really portable, too. This speaker is small and portable, and sounds great. Most importantly, it won't break the bank.I've enjoyed everything from classical to rock to hop hop on it, and it all sounds good. Bass response is actually very impressive for something so small, but it has decent mids and highs, too.",5,1,2016-1-8,1,0,0
"Goodness, what a find!  We've been off-and-on looking for a little office desk speaker for those moments when you can just shut the door, kick on some tunes and get to work.  With each device, the reviews were mixed and we tried a few anyway that were not of good sound quality.  Well thank goodness we took a chance on this little wonder!  Normal stuff - easily connects to a phone or device by cord or Bluetooth; can play using the battery or while its plugged in charging.  But very impressed with the clear and full sound!  No tinny-ness or all treble-tones, it actually delivers more than what we expected given its convenient desk accessory size.  How much did we like it?  We bought two more for family members and would buy again.",5,1,2018-4-13,1,0,0
"Small, but bumps pretty loud. I was really surprised when I turned it up high to test it out. I've used it at the beach a few times and it's super easy to fit into a small bag and connect. Would recommend if you don't wanna spend $$$ on a speaker",5,1,2020-7-30,1,2,0
"This is a Very Good speaker. I was very nervous about buying this because the last two speakers I've had were not that great at all. This speaker has a nice volume range and is very easy to use. The Best thing about this speaker is the battery life. I can charge it and use it at least 5 different times days between each other without it ever dying. And when it's connected, the battery life is on my phone which allows me to know when it needs to be charged. I'd definitely recommend this item.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"This little speaker is fantastic it's phenomenal. Every sound is crystal clear even at 100% volume!!  This particular one can be active for eight hours of  play back time at two thirds volume.

Can you imagine 30 hours??I've never returned anything to Amazon and you may charge this while you play it so.....I will keep it and I want the $10 rubberized case for it also with a carabiner clip!! The volume controls and pause and Bluetooth button are at the end of the speaker BUT I'd Love it more if you could CHANGE THE SONG/TRACK,  then I would not need my phone right at hand.

As soon as I attempt to project what I am watching on to my larger tv monitor, this thing stops working. So it works okay as long as you're watching on your tiny little phone but you can't get it to work for your TV. If that's what you're trying to do go with a different speaker.",3,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0

I found lots of little speakers that would wi-fi the signal from my phone, but they didn't amplify it at all.  So now I was just holding the little speaker up to my ear.  With this speaker, I was able to amplify the sound enough for both hands to stay on the wheel.  This really was the solution to my problem.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0

"Speaker works great with music, it's impressive given the small size.  Having the grill angled up helps to project the sound to fill a room.  The charge lasts quite a while too.  This is my first BT speaker and I've been impressed by the sound quality.Where this falls short is on the speakerphone functionality.  The speaker will not hold a connection to my phone when I'm on a phone call.  It continually cuts out and then reconnects, which is very very annoying. When connected, it works well, but I don't know if it'll stay connected for 5 seconds, 5 minutes, or an hour.  I'm very disappointed as I bought this to use my home office with my iPhone, and it not reliable enough to use in that manner.  I'm pretty bummed because the sound is great and it's never dropped the connection playing music, but I've yet to complete a phone call on the speakerphone and I've had the speaker for about a month at this point.",2,1,2016-4-30,1,1,0
I was surprized at the strong sound comming outof this little speaker. It's the perfect companion for a tablet computer when watching videos or music in the kitchen.

I bought this Bluetooth speaker so I can listen to music in my garage. It connected easily to my phone via Bluetooth and the sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker I like the fact that you can add a second speaker off the same phone and have true stereo sound. I haven't done that yet but it's a nice option. I now find myself using it to listen to videos while I'm cooking breakfast or working around the house. My last Bluetooth speaker would not last a week before needing a full charge. This speaker rarely needs a charge and with its great base and full sound I couldn't have asked for a better product I will be buying a second one just to have it. The sound quality and price are unbeatable.,5,1,2018-10-1,1,0,0
"Needed a durable Bluetooth speaker that was reliable to synchronize with my phone. I am no sound specialist or audio professor. Just wanted good quality, you get what you pay. For under $25 the speaker performs excellent indoors and outdoors. The Bluetooth is simple and some of the difficulty may be with your phone software then the speaker. It has good range with device connection and the volume is great. I used the headphone jack to connect to remote devices. The sound quality is still good. Compared to my $150 JBL speaker, that I use for only important occasion. Oontz speaker gets two thumbs up and it has been more than +4yrs and it is still pumping out the beats.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,1
"I don't get why this is so well reviewed. It totally lacks bass and has overrepresented treble that borders on sounding tinny. Its issues, of course, could be alleviated somewhat by using EQ to increase bass and decrease treble, but that shouldn't be necessary in the first place. Its battery is also rather mediocre and won't last you long if you play it loud (expect 5-8 hours) There are much better values to be had at this price.",2,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"I purchased this about a year ago for use while canoing and playing beer league softball. For the price, it is an excellent product that has held up to splashing and dropping just fine. It isn't as loud as some of the higher-end models (Bose, Altec Lansing, etc), but you can still hear the music clearly up to 50 feet away with a good mix of treble and bass. The battery typically lasts around 4-6 hours at near-max volume.Overall, no complaints for the price.",5,1,2017-5-4,1,1,0

"First, I should have written a review earlier as this is the best portable bluetooth speaker I ever had. Then I ran into a problem, it stopped working. Cambridge Soundworks immediately sent me a new one, I am impressed with their kind and timely response - kudos to you. The speaker itself goes very loud, good for me as I have compromised hearing. II is extremely sturdy and well made and shipped in a very sturdy box. I like especially that it doesn't tip over because of the wider base with its triangular shape. It is easy to pair. What else can I say?",5,1,2019-2-8,1,0,0
Purchased as a gift for my best friend by request and it was such a hit my husband asked for one as well. Nice quality with good sound and bass- it’s mainly used for listening to music in the shower and when it’s on you can clearly hear whatever song is on from the other side of the house (a blessing and a curse).Update- we bought another one (totaling 3) cause these are so nice to have we hate sharing.

"I bought this Bluetooth speaker to use in my bathroom, to have tunes while getting ready in the morning. I have had 2 other speakers that were okay for this purpose, but this OontZ speaker sounds much better. I don't need something that ""bumps"", just play my music. This speaker has a clear sound. My other speakers were a bit tinny. You can pick out some high notes, hear the bass, it sounds good to me in the hour or two I need it each day. I purchased it on sale after Christmas for a great price. I didn't want to spend much money on a speaker for the bathroom that could get knocked in a sink. I have used it every day since I received it and am very pleased with it.This speaker has rubber skids on the bottom so it does not slide around on the counter top. The triangle shape is easy to pick up to move it. I can answer calls through  the speaker. The volume, music and calls, are adjustable through my phone volume. It is very easy to set up the Bluetooth with everything we have, both old and new.",5,1,2017-5-27,1,1,0
"This is my first bluetooth speaker, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. But I do value quality sound and I have a good idea of how it's supposed to work. So, here's my experience.I actually really like this speaker. The bass is pretty anemic, sure, but what can you expect from two tiny drivers? That having been said, it does sound pretty good and gets quite loud, if you want it to. The battery lasts long enough that I don't have to think about it terribly often. (But I am only running it around 1 hour a day.) I haven't had reason to test waterproofing, so I'll have to take them at their word. I do like that it's quick to pair, and once paired it only takes a few seconds to connect. I've also been able to keep music streaming to the speaker even if I take my phone to another floor. Pretty impressive.",4,1,2016-9-22,1,0,0
"AUDIO: When it comes to audio systems, whether it be headphones, portable speakers, or home entertainment, you generally think that if you're not putting at least $100 into it, you're not gonna get exceptional results. Well, with the ""Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3"", you get big sound from a small portable speaker for sub-$30. The first song I played on this speaker was ""Attention"" by Charlie Puth. Based on the product description speaking of the speaker's subwoofer (didn't know speakers of size and price had subwoofers), I highly anticipated the chorus's bass line. I was NOT disappointed. The bass rocked the table, the floor (at full volume), yet I still heard the treble of the vocals. The sound was not muddy and I am a stickler for a sound that is not full and poorly represented.CONNECTIVITY: The Bluetooth pairing is seamless and has a rather long range. The sound never faded when I moved around with my phone paired to it. It does have an aux port option which is a plus.",5,1,2017-8-2,1,1,0
"I was hoping that this little thing would be tolerable, a trade-off between size and sound that I could accept.  Wrong.  The sound is spectacular -- clear and bright, deep and rich..  If someone fired it up behind you and you'd never seen it you would expect to turn around to find a full size system.  I sampled some Stan Getz, Dave Brubeck, Joao Gilberto, and Vladimir Ashkenazy -- all sounded great.  Wow.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0
I am very impressed with the price to performance on this speaker. My dad had bought one before and I had this on my wishlist for a while and finally bought it when the price was right. It's very easy to pair with other devices. Construction is pretty solid with the ends being rubberized. The power port is well covered by the rubber tab. We have used two different streaming services on it so far and both worked well. I didn't notice any issues with the connection or anything. The sound is excellent for such a small speaker. It can really crank the volume when you need it as has really good base for such a small speaker. i find the audio is quite clear although it can get a little muddled at higher volumes. Playing with the audio settings on your device might help with that. I guess one of the downsides is it says it can take 5-6 hours or so to fully charge it. We were playing music on it for quite a while with some friends over and it never ran out of juice so it seems like the charge does last a while. Only time will tell how long this speaker will last. For now it is a solid 4 out of 5.,4,1,2016-4-8,1,0,0
"Good product delivered in a timely fashion. The sound is good. Note that I use in my car since my car speakers no longer work and not worth repairing.  Volume is fine- I grade an ""A"".  Works well with my smart phone.  Blue tooth connectivity is quick when used. Sound/music quality on point. Volume in the car works fine. Battery life seems good. My initial charge with a USB computer hookup did take awhile but the charge is still there.  THe speaker seems very solid and well made and stays on my dash when I am driving. Bottom line. It does what I bought it for-- lets me listen to music in my car.",5,1,2018-9-16,1,0,0
"Our company office party consists of a gift exchange where the majority of the presents end up being portable Bluetooth speakers around 30 dollars.My coworkers and I spent our lunch breaks determining which ones were busts and which ones were decent. When it came time to compare the oontz, we made fun of the name saying there would be no way this would be any good. To our surprise, it had the best bass of the bunch. sound quality was better than the rest. every other speaker tested afterwards could not even match up.",5,1,2018-8-26,1,0,0
For a small bluetooth speaker this box has excellent sound quality.  I have 2 or 3 different BT speakers and the battery life on this one beats them all.  It's convenient to transport and readily captures every BT device to which I've connected.  Not that it's a big deal but my only gripe is the black-on-black buttons for volume control.  They should consider adding some color to them so you can easily adjust the volume without having to peer closely at the buttons.,5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"Ok. I’ve only had this a day, so this review and the number of stars could change. So far though.. this thing ROCKS! The construction of it it is solid and sleek. But the sound... wow! The sound is what lead me to write this. The sound is stunning. It’s (((LOUD))). There is treble and plenty of bass! I can’t comment on the battery life or just how water proof it is, but if it’s anything like the construction and the sound quality, then this has to be the best portable Bluetooth speaker on Amazon. As of right now I would highly recommend.",4,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"I really liked this speaker in the beginning, but within a few months, the micro USB charging port had to be fiddled with to get a charge. The last 4 months or so, I had to put a lot of twist and strain on the cord in order for the the speaker to charge. Yes, I tried several cords, including brand new ones. Micro USB sux. At the end of February 2020, it gave up the ghost and would not charge at all. Barely a year old. It is now in the trash. I will be searching for speakers that have different charging options.",2,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
Holy crap this thing has great sound for such a small speaker! I always test the sound on a speaker with a one of my favorite Imagine Dragons songs with a heavy beat—this thing vibrated my dining table with its bass. I got this for work and it was such a good investment!,5,1,2020-6-13,1,1,1
"Very nice! Great sound for personal listening, and does a fine job of filling a large room with loud volumes without sounding strained. I love the auto-off -- my previous speaker (HDMX Jam) had a slider-on/off switch and I'd leave it on and run the battery down constantly).The battery seems to last a good long time. Unfortunately, there's no audible ""battery low"" warning, only a LED indication, so when this thing need a recharge, it just quits.",4,1,2016-1-28,1,0,0
"I liked the ease in which this speaker connected via bluetooth. The sound was of good quality and volume until it started to fade in and out. It wasn't a connectivity issue. I have not used it on a daily basis, so I don't believe it's a wear and tear issue. It was never left outside or treated roughly and nothing was ever spilled on the speaker.  There is no reason I can think of as to why it would just start this issue out of the blue. Hopefully, I can find a more dependable speaker for a comparible price.  Or maybe, you just can't find a dependable speaker in this price range.",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
I was so pleasantly surprised by this purchase. I have gotten a couple different small portable speakers that over time have stopped working or stop being able to charge but this speaker was totally different. First off the sound quality is amazing. We like being able to bring the speaker outside and listen to music on the deck or bring it camping and this speaker is perfect for that. I was amazed at how loud it gets and how clear the sound is. The battery life is great too. I purchased a couple weeks ago and still haven't had to charge! It lacks a little  bass if you want to get picky but seriously for the size and price it's amazing... so much so I ordered a second that I'll save for the holidays as I know it would make a great gift!,5,1,2016-10-4,1,2,0
"A coworker has an earlier version of this speaker and it's a nice speaker, so I decided to get one for use in the other part of our department.  You get a lot of bang for your buck with this speaker!  This speaker works very well ,the sound is clear, relatively rich, volume is great and the pairing is extremely easy.  It also works when charging(I keep it plugged in), which is great, some speakers don't work when charging, so be careful.  I would highly recommend this speaker, nice compact size, good sound and a great all around speaker for a price that can't be beat.",5,1,2017-11-17,1,1,0
"This is the first Bluetooth speaker I have ever bought so I have nothing else to compare it with but the sound is incredibly rich. I was not expecting the speaker itself to be so small but do not let that fool you. It plays wonderfully with my Amazon prime music and movies. The sound is crystal clear. For the price it is a bargain. I haven't had the opportunity to blast the volume to high. My only little quibble is I wish the volume icons were painted a different colour than that of the black speakers. I highly recommend these speakers if you are looking for something inexpensive, portable, and will performance with satisfactory sound.",4,1,2018-6-21,1,0,0
"I've had this speaker for about 2.5 years and it still works great for me. My only complaint is when you plug it in to charge it, it doesn't fit snugly into the port so you have to position it just right and either tape it in place or prop it up with something so the cord is at the perfect angle (and make sure no one touches it) to keep the connection until charged. Somewhat inconvenient but considering the price and the overall quality, I can live with it.",3,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"Surprising sound quality from this little unit, and a decent top end volume. Waterproof enough to hang out next to the pool and shower, which is how I use it most of the time. For the price, it's a satisfying unit. Battery life so far has been decent, I haven't put it through any extended paces but it's been fun for a few hours at the pool.While the existing buttons are nice and work fine, I would have liked to have seen a ""next/prev song"" functionality incorporated into volume buttons via press-and-hold type design, without ""next/prev"" it is missing a crucial function. This is the biggest knock against it, which isn't so bad.",4,1,2015-12-11,1,1,0
"First let me say awesome product! Very loud and clear. However I have to give it a 2 star rating because of an issue I shall now disclose.I have had this speaker for more than 2 months now and I started to notice a slight swelling that continually got bigger. It seems to be the battery area. There is also some sticky stuff that formed near the area as seen in the pics. Let me state that I have never opened the device nor has it ever fell or been exposed to any heat to cause the battery to swell, nor overcharged or used with a faulty charger. I would be wary of this product as the build quality or battery has an issue or such. I will discontinue using the device as it does not seem safe. Sad, I really loved those speakers.",2,1,2018-4-10,1,0,1
"I kept reading rave reviews regarding this portable speaker.  All I can say is that I am a bit disappointed.  I am unsure if the reviews are in comparison to other inexpensive speakers or if the reviews are spam.  Basically the OontZ Angle sounds about the same as those old cheap white speakers that used to come with computers back in the early 2000s.  They just sound tinny, and lack any real depth, the quality is about as good as a TV speaker (or worse).  For context, I typically listen to music on Sennheiser headphones,  Polk Model 7 speakers,  or Bic Venturi dv62si.  Again, I wasn't expecting the OontZ Angle to be close to higher end speakers but they should at least not be painful to listen too, I might as well play music out of my cell phone.  A close family member has an old Bose Soundlink.  I am not a fan of Bose, as I generally consider them to be way over-priced.  But man, the OontZ Angle doesn't come close to comparing. How much would I pay for this speaker?  Maybe 5 bucks at Goodwill for a trasher go-anywhere speaker.  The positives: build quality is good, and my Moto X seamlessly connects to it via bluetooth.  Even now, as I am testing speaker with one of my favorite albums, I just want it off.",2,1,2018-8-8,1,0,0
"This unit works very well using the Bluetooth connection from my cell. The volume is excellent and the sound quality is excellent. I have only used the unit for listening to audiobooks, therefore, I have no experience with sound quality of music.I used this unit in my car, since the road-noise drowns out the cell phone speaker. This unit is a welcome addition to my listening experience. In fact, I had to turn the volume DOWN, since it was so powerful (smile). Anyone, who needs a speaker supplement for listening in the car/truck, this is the unit for you.",4,1,2016-5-24,1,2,0
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this speaker but I wanted to test it out.  Many times the cheap speakers or earbuds have a tin, washed out sound; not this speaker.  The bass is relatively deep due to the downward angle of the sound.  The triangle shape helps aim the sound in a specific area.  You can see and more importantly hear the engineering put in to this speakers design.  I may order two more.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0

"A small portable Bluetooth speaker. Keep that in mind when listening to your music. This is not a beach party speaker, it's not big enough for that task. If you want a portable party/beach speaker you need to buy a larger speaker which will require a much larger battery.I personally use it in my shower to listen to podcasts and audiobooks more than anything. It is not WATERPROOF, it never states that in the description. The image may be a little deceptive, it will handle a bit of splash. IPX 5: Protected against water jets - Water projected at all angles through a 6.3mm nozzle at a flow rate of 12.5 liters/min at a pressure of 30kN/m2 for 3 minutes from a distance of 3 meters.

"Overall I'm impressed with the sound that comes from this little speaker, it's not going to replace my entertainment center anytime son, but I can definitely see it being used in different situations. Speaker also has a bit more BASS than other portable speakers I own. I won't be starting a rave anytime soon, but I can enjoy the extra little oomph in the sound coming from it.I used the speaker in at the beach last Sunday, and while I was able to listen to my music when I was within a few feet of the speaker, the waves quickly drowned out the sound as I walked away from it, about 8-10 feet away. I wasn't expecting anything great from something that small under those conditions, but still felt it should be noted.",5,1,2016-5-10,1,0,0

"Look, if you are looking for full sound and that amazing bass everyone on here keeps talking about, I would look at another product.  But if you are looking for just a cheapo speaker to play music through, then this fits the bill.  This thing is the size of a soda can, and we bought it based off thousands of reviews and how people were saying it's so good for the product.  Long story short, I am returning it (just got it today)  Out of the box after you pair it to the phone, the highs and mids are extremely bright.  It is loud but, ear screeching loud.  In order to get the sound balanced right, I had to download an equalizer and boost the lows and bring down the mids in order for it to sound good.  At this point, it sounded pretty good for a 20 dollar speaker, however, when you use an equalizer app, it will bring your overall volume down, no matter how you mess with it.  So if you don;t mind using an equlaizer app and have half of the volume being stripped away, then maybe this 20 dollar speaker is for you,  but if you are expecting anything more, than look elsewhere.",2,1,2018-4-10,1,1,0
"My biggest complaint is that I'm constantly restarting the computer to get the speaker to pair up, or it freezes the computer, or some other nonsense. I'm using it with a laptop running Windows 10 if that matters. The sound quality is okay and the price was affordable, it's convenient for what it is, but I have had the speaker for maybe a week and honestly spent a few hours in that time just booting and rebooting everything trying to get something to pair up.",3,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
Definitely exceeded my expectations. This lil thing is amazing!. I love that fact that it has two volume settings one on your phone and the  other on the speak itself. So let’s say the volume is at its highest lvl on my phone I can then go to the speaker and pump up the volume even more. The sound quality is amazing loud and clear. Off the strength of me all of my friends have purchased this speaker and the newer series as well with the cases!!... It’s small but mighty.

"This simple yet perfect little speaker is like having the world's tiniest boombox. It has impeccable sound quality both at low and high volumes and although I typically listen to classic rock and R&B, I tried some of my favorite Rap and Hip-Hop tunes to find it has superior bass and treble without distorting the sound at high volumes, or vibrating off the table. It is almost small enough to fit into cargo shorts, but I enjoy the color options to make it stand out a bit. I've really enjoyed using this product and the battery life seems to hold up pretty well. The box did not come with instructions, but if you follow basic electronic care guidelines like charging it out of the box, and not overcharging it, it seems to be built to last.",5,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0
Bought this for myself as I wanted a small portable somewhat loud speaker and man was I surprised with the clarity and volume for the value. Amazing! Had also received as a gift a Sony bass boost small portable speaker valued between $30-$50 and found myself a bit disappointed with the result seeing that it was a name brand but the clarity was still there just lacking on volume.

"When I recieved my Angle 3 Enhanced, initially I was as happy as one could be with my purchase. I LOVED this little thing, it sounded WAY better than I expected - not alot of bass thump, obviously, but - clear, musical, & loud - real loud. Suprising volume for it's size. This was perfect for my work - I am a route delivery driver, and with the speakerphone feature as well as a bluetooth in my ear, I was covered in & out of my vehicle. It would go to my earpiece out of my truck - and automatically switch back to the Angle III speakerphone when I was driving. And sounded great. Perfect.But out of the box the first day, I noticed right off the bat that was a real drag, and a problem I've noticed with many similar products - the lack of attention spent to the USB Charging input. It's one of those, ""some units the cable fits properly - some units it doesn't"" type deal. No matter how you inserted the cable, it's fit with the unit far below sub-par. It just didn't go in and fit securely, in fact, not at all. You kinda had to prop it up gently when it was in, not bump it, and watch it closely to make sure it stayed in there - because half the time it wouldnt. A couple of times the connection was so that instead of charging it - it drained it instead. Not to mention that the design of the rubber casing in relation to  the width of the connector that was needed for that connector the go in and fit snuggly was not considered when designed. That, to me, is a mental error.  It clearly didn't fit, nor did the connector on the unit hold up. Beyond dissapointing, to say the least. But, I loved the sound. It was perfect. I would just make do, and be very careful with that part of it. And just make sure it was fully charged when I left the house each day.",2,1,2018-11-11,1,0,0
"Still kind of early but first review is very positive. Hefty little guy, feels solid, pairs easily, sound quality is very good. Surprising for a $20 speaker.

"Just received the product and the very easy to setup and pair with my Samsung Note 4.  The sound is very good and the microphone sounded great to a person I called to test that part out.  The unit is small enough to be very portable and the volume buttons, pause\play buttons are on the side and are easy to use when streaming audio from the phone.  The unit also has some weight to it - not sure if that ""good"" but it feels quite solid and the bottom has rubber strips which combined with the weight makes it quiet solid on the desk and won't be easily knocked off if bumped.The one minor issue is that the USB Micro cable that you use to plug the unit into the computer or AC adapter is very short, about 11 inches so it only allows me to set the unit on top of the computer if I used it, however, not sure about others but I have so many USB Micro cables around from other devices that are longer that I just used one of them.",5,1,2015-11-11,1,0,0

Its been to multiple beaches and trips and showing no sign of wear. I bought a case for it and stores my wires and MP3 player. When its time to listen to Pandora, it sync's seamlessly to my phone for me. Took less than a minute to connect with my phone the first time. I am not an audiophile, but I can tell you that I notice the difference in the richer tone and smooth bass coming from this speaker, than from my phone or headset.",5,1,2017-10-23,1,1,0
"This speaker works great! I ended up taking it to use in my classroom and decided to buy another for my home. The battery lasts a very long time and the sound quality is great! I was worried it wouldn't be loud enough because it's so small, but I actually have never had to turn it all the way up because the volume is strong. Definitely recommend this portable, bluetooth speaker.",5,1,2019-3-15,1,1,0
So far this little device is amazing. I bought 2 because I have 2 desktops without sound (which I think is absurd given that I spent $1200+ for each unit but that's for another review).  They both sound great and are surprisingly clear with no static. Such a very sleek and cute design that fits anywhere.  I'll revisit this update in a few months after I've used for a bit. So far I would highly recommend.,5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"SO, after heavy consideration and many failed attempts on speakers similarly priced I gave one more shot at finding a solid working diamond in the rough before forking out money for a UE boom or JBL flip.Well Jackpot, this speaker puts out so good bass for its size highs are crystal and the mids are spot on. At max volume it can get distorted with some more complex songs. I as a rule like to never listen to any speaker at that level. I try to stay a click or two under for optimal sound. The durability so far is amazing. I work in a warehouse and have to go into the deep freeze often and it does not waiver. For 27$ this is definitely a product worth referring to all my friends.  Well made and full of rich sound. :)",5,1,2016-6-7,1,0,0

"sounds a little tinny, like from a tin can type of sound. expected more bass from it. I have an Ipod nano 7th gen and I connect blue tooth. The nano has the ability to put more bass into music, even with that the music still sounds tinny. Really a shame, I had very high hopes for this little speaker. Only other good thing is I had no problem at all with it connecting with my  Alexa devices or bluetooth. I'm unsure if I will do more business with the maker of this speaker.",4,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

This speaker is very nice as it puts out great sound that you can hear throughout the room and into other areas of our first floor home.  I use this in our entry way and garage with an Amazon Echo Dot connected it with it to provide multi-room music throughout the home.  It's linked up with other echo dots that are either connected with other Bluetooth speakers or sound systems to give me the convenience and flexibility of having music being played throughout the entire house.  The speaker is a very nice component of that system.,5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"I love this! I had the old version for several years and it was SO dependable! I used it almost every day and brought it all over the world. It finally stopped charging, so I upgraded to this. AMAZING! Clearer and louder, the buttons are way more useful (including a forward and back button!) I also bought my dad one because he lives on a beach! Perfect! Must have!

This bluetooth speaker is by far awesome. I got two of them and we love them. I was skeptical at first due to being a product name I never heard of before but I took the dive due to the reviews and a friend recommending it to me. You won't be sorry with this product and the quality of sound.,5,1,2018-11-20,1,2,0
"This little speaker exceeds expectations.  First off, it is about the size of a 12 oz. drinking glass, but it has the sound of a much larger speaker.  The bluetooth connection is exceptionally easy.  Once I got it set up to my phone, all I have to do is turn it on and it connects.  The instructions say it has a six hour battery life.  I wouldn't know.  Every week or so, I re-charge it.  I'm thinking about getting one for each of the kids.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I have to admit, I wasn't too hopeful about this speaker but ordered based on the reviews. I'm now a believer.  Our family owns two different sized Bose Bluetooth speakers (Soundink) and the sound quality on this one compares to those for about 1/3 the price of the larger Bose.  Good battery life and compact size - easy to port around.  Connecting to my phone and iPad was incredibly fast.  It packs good sound in a little package at a reasonable price.  Definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"I loved this speaker for a year- now it won’t take/hold a charge, so I have to use it plugged in and even then, sometimes it shuts off randomly. I tried about 8 of these speakers and chose the Angle because it had great volume relative to size and was the only one that came close to have a usable mic for speaker volume (and then only marginal at best). Another complaint is that, due to the rubber cut out for the micro usb (charging port) so small and the edge being close to the port, many usb cables that have even a mid sized plastic end won’t get good/deep purchase of the connector so you need small ended usb cables to charge it. Also a problem with its competitors.",2,1,2018-2-20,1,0,0
"This speaker was great for six months and then just died. It just kept shutting itself off, and ultimately never stayed connected.It was made in China, and like everything made in China is cheap junk with a short shelf life.",2,1,2020-5-18,1,1,0
This is my second Bluetooth speaker. and it a great improvement over the other one that cost more than twice as much (from a different manufacturer).Here are my observations after 2 weeks of use:,5,1,2016-11-11,1,0,0
"A nice piece of gear for what it is.  Set up and synching are a breeze and it works flawlessly.  Range is excellent.  I got it mainly as a speaker for my cell phone, since the native one is poor.  It works very well for that.  I also use it to listen to streaming radio and podcasts.  Great for that.  The sound quality for such a tiny speaker is remarkable.  It certainly does music quite well for its size, but don't expect true hi-fi.  It tends to be just a little boxy.  Given the exceptional performance and versatility I'd recommend it highly if you need a small, portable speaker to synch with a phone or other bluetooth device.",5,1,2017-6-16,1,1,0
This bluetooth speaker is amazing! The sound on it is loud and clear. I feel like it works better than my speaker on my phone. It is super easy to connect the bluetooth and the battery life is great. I have even purchased several more of these for gifts. Everyone loves them.,5,1,2019-5-6,1,2,0
"It cannot pair! I bought this after previously buying three of the last version. I did not realize this one cannot pair with ANY other speaker, including an identical one. That’s why I bought it and I’m not happy. Otherwise it’s okay for the price. I’ll be buying some other speakers to get what I want.",2,1,2019-12-20,1,1,0
"You can tell from the moment you play a song it's inexpensive and obviously not booming home theater quality. It DOES get very loud and it's clear, but it still has that slightly small device/ kid's toy radio sound quality to it (not exactly, maybe a few quality notches better than that).  It's perfectly fine if you use it to listen to podcasts, audio books, asmr etc. For music, it will get the job done for a small surrounding space as long as you don't expect high ""beats"" quality.",3,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"Surprisingly impressive sound! It had me fooled for a minute. Out of the box, paired immediately, but played very quiet and kept breaking the signal. I eas ready to give up on it, but I looked at the directions and it said that in low battery mode it plays quiet to preserve life. After I charged it it started BOOMING immpediately! Fantastic and loud sound! The only doenside I see is that it truly has to be within unobstructed range of your iDevice (in my case my phone) or it will break and crackle. The flyer says it's good up to 30 feet but I have a hard time believing that. I had it within 5-6 feet (through the window) and if I placed my phone on the dining table the wrong way or ny kid turned the speaker away from it (outside on the deck) it would crackle and break. So I guess as long as you keep it faily close to the source it plays great. Haven't tried the water reaistance features, so I can't speak to that.",4,1,2016-10-24,1,0,0
"This little speaker really packs a punch. The sound is amazing and can keep up with any music genre you blast through it's speakers. Only downside is there is no track skipping available on the speaker itself, but it's still well worth a purchase. I keep it my bathroom for showers, so it's always in a wet environment. Still going strong. Took it to work and got paint all over it. Still going strong. Dropped it several times, still going strong.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

"This is my first ever 1 start review as usually, I get good products based off purchasing from others reviews.  My old Magic Box died from years of heavy usage.  Since they no longer sell that model, I went with this Angle based off of Reviews.  I connect it with an MSI Laptop with 16G ram and SSD Drive so there should be no problems as I never had a bluetooth issue with my other devices.  Yet, since the day I bought it, this Angle speaker crackles and sometimes stutters while I listen to music or whatnot from my PC.  In addition, I figured to use on my boat connecting with my Phone.  Well, my phone will not connect to it.  Thus, it is a waste of a product for me.",1,1,2018-9-18,1,0,0

"For such a small sized and low-wattage speaker, this product has both excellent sound quality and volume. I have had mine for over 2.5 years now.

"This speaker is incredible. At first glance, it seems tiny and somewhat incapable of producing a good sound. But once you connect this to your iPhone/iPad/mp3 player, you'll quickly notice that the sound quality is INCREDIBLE. It can get exceptionally loud despite its small size, and does not lose any sound quality whatsoever. In fact the quality is so crisp I think it actually outshines my iPhone's natural sound capability.

It has a separate sub woofer and tweeter  which I wouldn’t expect.  For example I bought an Altec Lansing speaker about the same size and it could only maintain about 70 to 75% of the sound and base level of the speaker, it’s great!  Battery life is great, the quality is that of Bose.",5,1,2018-7-21,1,0,0
"I love it, i don't care. But it quite surprised me! Maybe they can fix it in later product improvements if possible. I put my forefinger underneath the plug when it was done charging, and thumb on top. I moved my thumb as close to the connection as possible, to get leverage. I pivoted the tip of my thumb forward to press against the 'base', where it plugs in. I touched it and applied pressure to pop the plug out, and got bit. It felt like touching both ends of a really strong nine volt battery.But the bass thumps and it's LOUD. Very great for the price and size!",5,1,2017-12-26,1,1,0
"One of the best brand speakers i have owned. I’ve had a few Sony, JBL, and 808 speakers. This one has lasted me the longest. I’ve had it for a year now and I’ve put it threw so much. I’ve dropped it hundreds of times from high places. It’s gotten dropped in a pool and still works perfectly. The size of this speaker is very convenient. The bass, tremble and loudness of this speaker for its size is very surprising. The battery lasts around 7-8 hours at full volume. I just upgraded to newer version since i ended up breaking it and can’t wait to test it out. The one issue i have had is that on a very rare occasion it will cut out, but when that happens i just turn it off and back on. It starts to work perfectly again. Great speaker for 26 dollars. You honestly won’t regret it.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

I love the fact that I can keep my phone in pocket and walk away 40ft and it still holds a great connection. FANTASTIC little guy. The sound is great-- really loud. When you crack it up you can literally hear the bass if on a shelf as if its blowing puffs of its own. The battery life I give it 8/10 over the course of 4 hours of use for 3 days on a 6/10 level of volume. I practically placed it in a ziplock bag and sanded my projects and it worked great without issue.,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"Easy to use & 5 star for Bluetooth music playing from iPad (less so for phone calls from iPhone).  Speaker is lightweight, good sound, no crackling at high volume, handy size & very portable.  30 feet blue tooth range more an 'up to 30' but it works very well for my needs for music via Bluetooth in garden.  Nice value for money.  Do not recommend as 5 star for using for phone calls - people can't hear me well even when Oontz speaker held close and using Oontz with iPhone Bluetooth seems to trigger dropped calls.  I tried phone use at home & in car, standing still inches away and moving, it's just not great for phone calls.",5,1,2018-5-29,1,0,0

In the summer I plan to take it to the beach, pool and kayaking. Battery life is amazing. I have charged it 2x since my purchase 3 and a half weeks ago. I've used it every night while taking a shower and to watch a few tv shows in bed from my phone. On Christmas Eve I used it for my dinner party and played background music for around 7 hours.

The charge lasts pretty long- we've been using it on and off since Christmas Eve and have just now needed to charge it (about 18 days). The only drawback Ive come across is I wish it had longer bluetooth range so I could set my laptop down and walk around with the house with the speaker, but it doesn't do well if I turn a corner into another room but besides that I love it",5,1,2018-1-12,1,1,0

However, once I tweaked the sound output with Apple iTunes equalizer setting, my music sounded great. Where you place the speaker makes a difference in the sound.

I don't care about battery life or pairing distance, I plan to use this at work and it won't ever be more than 10 feet from my phone or an outlet so I apologize if my review is not helpful in that area. Listening right now at full volume to (LOL) Paula Abdul (How did that get on my playlist? hmmmm) -- the highs are a little bright.. but nothing I won't be able to solve using the equalizer on my phone!  Highly recommended.

"I have used this product now for a couple of months and am very pleased with it. Although it may not have as great a depth of sound as more expensive Bluetooth players, the OontZ Angle 3 portable wireless speaker more than meets my needs. Although I have not used it in wet conditions, the speaker provides plenty of volume so I can hear music, movie audio, and podcasts from my portable devices. I have even connected it to the external speaker port of my non-Bluetooth capable laptop for better sound. This speaker works well in a mobile life style for camping, hiking, boating and even in the car/truck when you cannot connect your mobile device to the vehicle's audio system. A very good speaker for the price!UPDATE 12 August 2016:  It has been almost a year since my review and I raised my original rating from 4 to 5.  Although this speaker doesn't have the dynamic range of more expensive Bluetooth speakers, I have found that that does not matter within the environments I have been using this speaker.  I travel a lot and find that the OontZ Angle 3 provides good quality sound for watching movies on my tablets in motel rooms and listening to podcasts when driving my vehicles or rental cars on trips especially when I cannot interface with the vehicle's audio system.  I can adjust the volume loud enough to overcome highway speed road noise in vehicles with the windows up.  The Oontz Angle 3 lasts a long time on a full charge.

"I really liked my Oontz bluetooth speakers when I got them.  I had one from another retailer (maybe 6-8 mos), it worked great, so I bought one on Amazon.  As soon as I got the new one, the first one died.  And then 2-1/2 months later, new one died too.  Even tried to use it plugged directly into the charger, and still nothing.  Too late to return. So if I just got two lemons, that's a bummer because they were great when they worked.",1,1,2018-9-6,1,1,0
"I have two of these, and they are great little speakers, but they have one fatal flaw-- a flimsy charging port. I have had the first one for a little over a year, and for the last few months we have been limping along trying to get it to charge by positioning the cable just right. Today it quit charging altogether, in spite of multiple attempts with a couple fresh cables to rule out the possibility of the cable being bad. The second one I've had for around six months, and its charging port has been starting to feel loose as well. Love the speakers, but obviously they're useless if you can't charge them.",2,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
I bought the original oontz angle about 4-5 years ago and i love it. I still use that one today and it's going just as strong as it did when I bought it. I saw they have made some new models and I bought this as a shower speaker and it has been nothing short of great! it has a lanyard so you can hang it from the handle and not eat up shelf space. This speaker lives in my shower with no issues and I only need charge it...well I don't even remember how often I have to because i do it that infrequently!,5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0

Out of nowhere, the speaker started smelling like burnt. I got worried because I thought it was something going on with my Car's engine... (as I had my speaker in my car at the time)...later on I tried charging it..Nothing. Completely died and I took good care of it. RIP 2017-2019. Only lasted me a little over 2 years.

Now the 2nd one barely holds a charge and the first one isn't working at all, despite being charged overnight. WE'VE ONLY HAD THESE FOR TWO MONTHS! Really disappointed.

"Impressive. Small but incredible powerful bass, sounds good, good connectivity. Trebles are a bit limited in frequency although from those small speakers I would not expect but treble.

In my huge livingroom we have to yell to hear each other if is at max output.I have also the more expensive Jackery Boom - In comparison the OontZ has better trebles, a tad lower bass but kind of same power.",5,1,2016-9-29,1,0,0
"I got this to take when I am shooting pictures and it's boring waiting around for that perfect time/picture.

The ease in which I can take this with me on the road is awesome. I can plug it in the car on the way and then it's ready to go for my walk.

"Great bluetooth speaker.  If you are looking for a high end speaker with wall rattling bass and amazing clarity, look someplace else.  If you are looking for good sound at a great price, this is it.  It connects easy, charges easy, incredibly portable and is loud.  It connects as a speaker phone, but unless you shout or pick it up and talk into the mic, it is really hard to hear for the other party.  There are better speaker phone options out there and I didn't buy this for that feature, so no down side for me.The bass comes across a bit stronger if you can have it sitting on a hard surface, there are ""open"" vents on the bottom for the bass.",5,1,2016-3-25,1,1,0

When it came I was really surprised at the sound.I took it out of the box and plugged it in to charge it, but was already charged.

"I picked this up to keep on my desk at work. I had another, MUCH more expensive speaker for a short period of time but decided it wasn't worth the nearly $200 price and returned it. This speaker came up as the Deal of the Day recently for 1/10 the price of the other speaker so I jumped on the deal.When it arrived I put it through its tests. I let my kids play their music on it (top 40 mainly), I let my wife play her music on it (oldies and Salt & Pepa....she has an eclectic taste), and I played my own music (a vast array ranging from Avett Bros, Bob Schneider, Yo Yo Ma, Beastie Boys, etc) and we were all quite pleased! This speaker is not nearly big enough to give you deep bass, but in an office setting that's definitely what one would want. This is also perfect for talk radio and sports play-by-play.",5,1,2015-11-14,1,0,0
"This little guy is great. No pass codes, or weird stuff, just turn it on, have your phone set with bluetooth on, and it will pair up without any fuss. It makes a little chime when you're connected and then you're hands free for calls and you can play music anywhere. Great for in the bathroom, near the pool, at the beach, etc. It gets fairly loud. Turned up all the way, it was too loud for comfort in our living room with our 4 year old. Battery lasts pretty much the whole day. Easy to recharge. Way better than the phone's basic tiny speaker. Keep your expectations in check, these are still very small tweaters, don't expect thumping bass and stuff, just think of it like a ""shop radio"" and you'll enjoy it.",4,1,2018-2-8,1,0,0
"Review for OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) - Bluetooth Portable Speaker. Purchased for $26 and had it for about two weeks now. Bluetooth works as advertised when paired with different devices (phone, laptop, tablet) . I also connected this to a movie projector via stereo cable and the sound quality was clear. Deep bass is noticeable and clear voice for 10W speaker. Waterproof feature is proven when I accidentally splashed pool water on this. OVERALL: Outstanding bluetooth speaker with quality sounds. GOOD BUY!",5,1,2020-7-24,1,1,0
This speaker came packaged well and turned right on as I tried it when I opened package. The size is good as it isn’t too big or too small. It connected easily to my iPhone and my android device. I controlled it from about 45 ft away with no problems. The sound sounds great for the price and seems very durable.  I charged the battery over night the first day I got abs it’s still goin on the charge with a few hours of play everyday. Controls are simple and easy enough. I would recommend this for a cost conscious person who wants to use today’s technology. I will give update a few months of use,5,1,2018-12-28,1,0,0
"Love the sound out of this little thing & the fact that it was at a good price makes this blue tooth speaker, overall, a great value. The battery could be ~25% longer, in my opinion. And sometimes the blue tooth button does not always connect, even when my device is actively searching for the OontZ speaker. I will try more than a couple times, too. Typically this occurs with my laptop. I will have to click ""forget device"" and do a fresh reconnect. I live in the great USA so I have little complaints about life, but this could be better :)",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0

"I give this petite speaker 3-1/2 stars. It's surprisingly small and sounds like a small speaker. Nothing real impressive sound-wise (just ""okay""), but the fact it's both bluetooth and hardwire capable is appreciated. Unlike some (annoying) speakers, this one doesn't cut off power when it's plugged into an outlet. So you can keep it plugged into your Echo or laptop or iPod, and not have to fool with turning the speaker on every day -- if the speaker is plugged into an outlet, it will stay on (unless you push the 'off' button). Also like the angled design -- points the sound up to your head, rather than to your chest (or waist).",4,1,2018-4-18,1,0,0

"Great little speaker.  I bought this for my 95 yr old Mom who is hard of hearing.  We placed it on the end table next to her chair and it really helps her hear the TV.  You can adjust the volume and it will play loud and clear if you want it to.  I purchased the TaoTronics wireless portable bluetooth transmitter which I plugged into the TV and transmits to this speaker.  Works perfectly.  If you happen to get static or it cuts out check to make sure you don't have it real close to/touching something metal.  We tried hanging this on Mom's lamp using a wire hanger & had that problem.  Once we removed the hanger, no problems.",5,1,2017-7-14,1,1,0

"I personally loved this speaker the first month of usage. I use it in the shower, but I do not splash water on it or let it get near any water since it is only water-resistant, not water-proof. After a month of usage, a (white noise like) static sound started to come out of the speaker. I was very very disappointed because it is not ""crisp and clear"" anymore. If you plan on getting this speaker, do NOT use it in the bathroom or wherever you shower. The steam would most likely ruin the speaker, which is crazy because my bathroom mirror barely gets foggy after a hot shower. What a disappointment. Time to search for a better, more durable speaker.****EDIT: I contacted the seller about this problem, and I received a free replacement. The shipping was really fast! I just threw away the old one since the static was so loud, but the new one sounds great! Love how the company takes pride in its product and serves its consumers.",5,1,2017-9-6,1,1,0
"Ease of use, size, look, all 5 star worthy...  Volume is descent, not ear blasting, but good enough (considering the price).  The one thing that I am blown away by is the length of time on a single charge.  Took this to the beach and every single day, we had this thing on full volume for no less than 5 hours each day and not once did the battery die (we did recharge each night). I think one day we even went 8 hours and still was kicking by the end of the day.  Every other bluetooth speaker we've had (including high quality like bose) has never been able to last that long on full volume.

"I've owned quite a few small bluetooth speakers over the last 10 years and have seen steady improvement with each model year. The sound quality and build have seen the greatest growth.  That being said, I found myself quite impressed with the latest offerings from Cambridge SoundWorks. The particular model I currently use is the Oontz Angle 3. Granted, there won't be too many small speakers that will blow you away with deep bass, but this little guy is very punchy. You can actually hear the staccato of the lower notes as opposed to the muddy delivery of speakers past. Mids and highs come across very loud and clear without a hint of distortion unless your source's volume is turned up too high. Temper your expectations though, this isn't designed to start parties in large rooms, but rather an excellent personal listening experience. The sound level is exceptionally loud for such a small speaker so I'm tempted to see what their larger speakers offer in a future purchase.  The current one is definitely an easy choice if you're looking for great sound in a small package.",5,1,2016-5-4,1,0,0
Amazing sound in a small box.  Battery life is unbelievable and the distance is great.  My previous Bluetooth speaker got 6 hours of play at about 30’.  This speaker gets 12 hours easily and the distance is around 100’ from my iPhone.  I use Pandora for my music while working in the yard and my phone sits up at the house in the shade and on a charger while the speaker is in the general area where I’m working.,5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Bought it gor like 20 bucks. The sound quality is better then to be expected its great. The design isnt revolutionary but it simple, compact, and convinient. Does what it needs to.  Only major issue is if i block the bluetooth signal with, for example something as miniscule as my leg, the audio from the speaker becomes kinda spotty. Granted thats probably thanks to my janky ass phone. Great quality buy it.",5,1,2018-10-13,1,1,0

Majorly worth the price! I love this thing. (March 2nd 2020) end update.This speaker is a lot smaller than I thought it was, but wow. It sounds awesome, looks nice, and super easy to connect to.

"I have a JBL Flip 2 that my cat chewed on the cord and subsequently made it hard to charge so I'm looking to replace it.  I absolutely love the sound on the Flip 2, but after reading the reveiws on this, I thought it might be worth a try.  I figured I could risk $30.  Well, the sound quality doesn't come close to what the JBL Flip 2 has.  Its very tinny, next to no fill or base sound.  It'll work for the beach, but that's likely the only place I'll use it. If you're looking to replace your JBL Flip 2 or similar product in quality and price, this is not the one you want.  It's a decent, at best, speaker if you don't have any preference to full, rich sound.  Filler sound, go for it, party music, forget it.  I should have known better as the Flip 2 was $100 new, but I was being cheap, hoping for a lower cost alternative, no such luck.",3,1,2017-4-21,1,1,0
"The sound quality exceeded my expectations.  The sound is clear and full.  I didn't require sound quality that good.  My main application is to listen to podcasts while I work in the yard.  I wasted money buying three lesser bluetooth speakers thinking I would save money since my requirements were low.  However, they were a waste of money.  Quality (sound and build), battery life, etc. just didn't do the trick.  I should have bought a product like this to begin with.  In the long run, those cheap bluetooth speakers were more expensive.With the good sound quality of these speakers, I will be using them for music as well as podcasts.",5,1,2018-4-24,1,0,0
"While the sound quality and battery life is adequate from this speaker, I would advise against it. As you can see from the attached picture, the electrical connector ( where you plug in to charge it) is made of extremely soft, poor quality metal. After just several plug ins the soft metal bends and twists so the charger can no longer make the contacts to charge the speaker which leaves it useless. I am extrememly careful with my stuff so I know for sure this is a weakness in this speaker. In fact, if you search the reviews, you will find others complaining about the charging port being made  from poor metal and failing. I believe most of the positive reviews are when the item is received before the part fails. I did contact the seller who advised me the speaker only had a 90 day warranty (really?)  They suggested I ship it back at my expense and pay $9.99 to have it potentially fixed.  NO THANK YOU!!",2,1,2019-12-31,1,0,1
"I rarely write reviews.  I bought this a year ago and have been using it ever since.  Today my cell phone is WiFi connected to Amazon Prime music.  The OontZ is 10 feet away on top of my old stereo cabinet connected to the cell phone via Blue Tooth.  I am listening to wonderful music from Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, etc.  The music is full and clear.  The sound from the little box is amazing.  Now, I must say I am 77 and lost much of my high frequency hearing flying helicopters so a younger audiophile might disagree.  But I have always been a music lover and this little box sounds like a large stereo.  I am impressed.  I am also happy to have Prime music as a benefit of my Prime membership.  I can handpick the music I want and listen to it static free, clear, and with no commercials.  Wonderful.For anyone thinking of a wifi speaker, this one is quite well made and performs well.

You can recharge it when not in use, just like the Kindle and it's ready to go.  We bought one for my husband first and liked it so much that we bought another one for me.

My Windows 10 computer speakers were not getting the job done so I needed a small speaker to boost the sound for personal viewing.  This one really works great.  It is not adequate to fill a large room or blast to a distance but for a few people in one room it is great.

It's not horrible by any means, but is average for its package (again: price/product type).Feels pretty sturdy, and I'd estimate could prob take a couple drops, dinks, or doinks, but not much more.

"This is a great little speaker! The sound is truly fantastic and because of its size and shape, it worked very well for our needs and sat easily on a closet shelf. My 6 year old with Autism lives for music, so it was vital we had a speaker we could trust to play throughout the night. There were a few times that I'd forget to charge the speaker and it would work for another 10 hours the next night and not die.It had a few issues, like connectivity, for instance, but it was always a quick and easy fix by just turning off the bluetooth on my phone and turning it back on. No big deal. Recently, the charging port has caused some problems. A charging cord doesn't stay in place and I'd have to set the speaker just so in order for it to charge.

"Let me start by saying I purchased this Speaker with my own money and through the many reviews granted by Amazon it helped me on my purchase... Now to the Speaker. I must say it's a love and dislike feeling I don't hate it at all just a view could get better but overall great speaker...the build is pretty solid it's like a silicone soft case on the two ends shape as  squares...an the body is like an amazing plasltic or a soft but steardy metal....the points are low key and I must say it took me going on the internet to discover how to charge it...the very flush which is a plus seeing that it's water resistance not water proof... Picture this it's more of a pour you know when it rains slow but not heavy kind of rain and not to dunk in water the underneath seems open wouldn't really take a chance on that....the 10w speakers boom....I test all my speakers on high volume.... It's because you know it's limitations on quality not quantity.... On high volume you get a slight crisp in the Speaker for does who are partying in a small room you would never notice but on the other hand in the same room quiet it would sound a little bit annoying ...but by yourself a nice medium sound makes the Little Giant sound like a Bose....not nearly as good as the bose but not that far away...not like other sized speakers that are bigger but not as good...not to down it really but the venstar Taco which I also bought was less impressive it was about the same price, bigger and straight in terrible... The highs on the venstar sounds like the meds on the oontz....an like I said about the same price....the oontz has little flaws but flaws none the less....I rate it truthfully and at the best of my ability.... It's an amazing Speaker for an amazing price which I bought not gave to review from company's that arebmentioned and no photos are shown because I also don't represent them as an employee to promote neither dictate claims.

"For the price, the OontZ Angle 3 is an awesome little speaker.  It sound quality definitely surpasses its' price range and it's durable enough that I don't even think twice about letting it get wet, or if it accidentally drops.

"This is a nice speaker. When using Bluetooth there is a delay of about 1/2 to 1 second when watching a video. I'm not sure if it's my phone or the speaker or my Xfinity and/or TMC apps or accounts. Despite how easy it was to set up, it does not work as expected through Bluetooth. As a result, I have to use it by patching it into the AUX of the phone.UPDATE: I left my new speaker with a coworker and asked him to test the Bluetooth capabilities with his equipment. He owns a tablet, but it doesn't have Bluetooth capability. However, he did try it with his phone. He said that the speakers Bluetooth worked just fine with it (no delay while watching video).

It's small enough to where you can put it anywhere. It's even water resistant. You can't go stick it directly in the water BUT you can absolutely put it in the shower with you.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"Bought this on a whim from the reviews alone and they are so right. Very impressed with the big clear sound coming out of this little thing. Pairs up with Bluetooth beautifully. Charge it up via USB and the charge lasts quite awhile depending on how loud you like you're music. The louder you go, the less battery life you'll have. If you dont have Bluetooth, there is an input for a cord. I just wish I could figure out how to pair two of these to the same device to have stereo sound.",5,1,2017-6-15,1,2,0
I ordered this Bluetooth speaker due to the low price and my friends success with his. I was excited to replace my cheap Best Buy unit with this one as it sounds better.  I unboxed the speaker gave it a full charge and it lasted eight minutes before it lost Bluetooth connectivity. I’ve had many Bluetooth products and fully know how to use them and the products they pair with. The speaker no longer presents its availability to any products  when searching for available Bluetooth connectivity.  It literally worked for two songs.  I bought this product online so I did not have to go to a store. The product is getting replaced but now I have to go to the UPS store to send the garbage back.  Kind of takes a point out of online shopping.  We will see how the second one holds up. Until then my $15 Best Buy speaker still works after two years.,1,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"I am absolutely amazed at the sound quality and volume of such a small speaker! At first, I was hesitant to take it in the shower with me, but after reading what an IPX5 rating is on Wikipedia, I realized it can handle a lot more than my dripping shower head. I wish we could give 1/2 stars,because i hate to knock a whole star off for something so trivial, but it might not be. I have this cranked up on a desk (the bass fires out at the bottom) and it began moving across the desk! If I hadn't been there and noticed it, it would have fallen to it's doom! Great power, but maybe the rubber feet aren't sticky enough? Don't let this dissuade you from purchasing, just don't let it vibrate itself off your table! It doesn't always happen, just certain surfaces.I've gotten to use this a lot more and it really is a dynamo! I've had it in some larger sized rooms and it really fills it up with sound. Impressive, clear. I'm giving it back its missing star. It needs all five. Especially since I just ordered two more.",5,1,2016-2-1,1,0,0
"Holds a charge for a long time, plenty loud enough for use in the kitchen while cooking or in the bathroom while showering.  The sound quality is better than you would expect, it's far smaller than you would think too.  The only issue I have is getting it to reconnect to my phone after it's been shut off for a period of time, almost every time I have to re-sync it from scratch and often multiple times before it takes.  It's not a phone issue as I've had the same problem with multiple phones and tablets, it's a minor annoyance but I hope it doesn't get worse.",4,1,2017-9-17,1,1,0
"Well, my Oontz finally kicked the bucket. I purchased in Jan. 2017 and dragged it all over. I use it the steamy bathroom while in the shower, drag it along on every beach trip, forget it in the backyard. It never gave me any trouble until I noticed it would not turn on or charge this morning. I’d say that is well worth the price. I decided I should review since I have over 3 years of experience with it and was on Amazon just to re-purchase.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I bought my speaker back at the end of 2017.  The bluetooth connectivity is hit and miss.  I dont think it is a great speaker for that in my use.  I hook it up to a phone or a shuffle via hard wire.  I use it for golf and I've beat the hell out of it and spilled almost every liquid on it and it's still going strong.  The charge still holds pretty long.  For the price, it's a pretty good deal",4,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0

"My last bluetooth speaker which I actually spent a good bit on for my birthday died and wasn't that good in the first place, which is why I was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be such a great purchase! I need good loud music in the shower and like to jam all the way back to my room and this puppy is great for it, the battery life lasts for a good while, great connectivity, and even BETTER sound! It gets my room and the bathroom rumbling it's so loud and crystal clear to boot! My whole family uses it often, highly recommend!!",5,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"I purchased this because I was tired of the wires from my old soundbar connected to my computer.  This was really easy to set up with my phone (I use it with Pandora). I stand it up on edge, so that it gives more of a deep sound.  Mind you, I have it pretty low, because it's just meant as background music on my desk, but I have had it on a little louder and the sound is really good. Great value for the price !  Would highly recommend for office use.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0

great for being so tiny. Pretty surprised by this little gizmo. Its been really great. Until the other night. The thing jumped off the counter started rolling around. Couldn't catch it tried to feed it water it. Nothing would get it back. Finally after like an hour I fed it some macaroni and it went back to normal.Oh crap. Wrong review.  Right the speaker box.

For such a tiny little speaker its actually surprisingly loud and durable. I use it in my gym at work and usually I get someone from our commanders office coming down and saying they can hear my music all the way up in their offices. This speakers been dropped from good heights and still looks and works perfectly. Heck one of my K-9's got ahold of it once and it never lost signal or stopped playing. If it ever does kick the bucket I'm buying 3 more.,5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
"Compared to my Bose, ok you give up a little bass, but the upper end of the frequency range is much more clear. All of these bt speakers would benefit greatly from an equalizer to allow each user to fine tune the sound to themselves and the intended use, but I haven't found an applicable one. I use this one to play music or other sound to sleep better. It will play for 8-14 hours at a mid to low volume setting. And it seems to be very well built and durable. I travel a lot for work and at this price, I'm not going to cry too much if it's misplaced.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"Has terrible static when using the 3.5 jack. Might be a short on the motherboard. Comes and goes when you press the jack down. Doesn't give me the option to return for a replacement and it's a 3rd party seller, so the process is painful these days and just not going to be worth the hassle to return for refund and wait weeks to get another cheap speaker. Bluetooth seems to work fine. Seems pretty cheaply made.",1,1,2017-11-16,1,2,0
"Bought this product to replace my Bose blutooth speaker.  This unit is easy to pair with my iPhone, iPad, or any other blutooth device that I have.  Pairing is a no brainer.  Sound quality is really good but could use a bit more bass.  This is understandable due to the fact that this is one of the smaller units that Oontz sells.  I would expect more bass response from their larger units.  Charging is easy and quick.  Build quality is excellent and there is  no annoyingly loud beeping anywhere in the process.  This is a great portable unit that can be used anywhere you want to play music from your mobile device.",5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"In my current old car I have no Bluetooth or a AUX port so I was stuck with the radio before getting this speaker. This little speaker BUMPS. It has impressive sound quality and volume. Putting my phone all the way up as well as the speaker on max it sounds like my would be car system playing. I used this speaker everywhere now, on the beach, in the house, even on runs in my backpack and it works great. As far as battery life it lasts me about 4-6 hours I would say fully charged and continuously playing, I usually charge it at night. Besides that it is small and can fit where ever you need it to and definitely delivers when you want to listen to some music.",5,1,2018-8-16,1,0,0
"I don't know how this is happening but when I connect this Bluetooth to my/other phones or iPads it will cut the network to nothing and stall the video or movie I am watching.

Wish I could return both items just so I never have to see them again.",1,1,2019-2-5,1,1,0
"The speakers in my car went out, and I'm not about to spend however many hundreds to get them fixed...my car is over ten years old and legally totaled so it's on it's last legs anyways...But I needed music.  I 3M taped this little guy to the dash, hooked the Bluetooth to my phone and plugged in the USB charger to my cigarette lighter and BOOM!  I have speakers again!  The sound isn't amazing, but it's pretty decent for how little the speaker box is, and for the price, you really can't go wrong.  It gets loud too!",5,1,2019-1-24,1,0,0
"I really really want to like this speaker because it's sturdy, small, and has a great sound for its size. But it keeps failing. I do a lot of transcribing where it's important that I hear every word -- after only 10-12 minutes of using my transcription program, the speaker output begins to stutter and become unintelligible. I thought it was just with that program, but sadly after only 30 minutes into a movie, it did the same thing. Doesn't matter how close or far from the source the speaker is, doesn't matter if it's plugged into the USB. Just returned it.",2,1,2017-2-13,1,2,0

As far as shortcomings, there are a few, but they are either minor or expected.1. Bass - For the size (about the size of a can of coke), I am actually impressed with the bass response, but it's hardly what i would call excellent.

"I own a few bluetooth speakers, including a Creative Airwave and the 1st gen Amazon Echo.  I think this is the best sounding out of them all.  Granted, it won't compare to some high end speakers, but for $20, it's definitely worth the money, and it definitely beats ones I own that are three times the price!  You really can't beat the sound quality for the price.  Throw in the small size and it being splash proof and it's an incredible deal.  I was very impressed with the quality of the speaker, and with how loud it gets!  One of the few purchases I've made that is absolutely worth every penny.",5,1,2018-8-8,1,0,0

We bought one to use in our kitchen and have it perched on a shelf above the stove, so it gets all sorts of spatters and steam from cooking and it keeps on working flawlessly!When we recently lost our son, we needed a speaker to play a song at his outdoor funeral service. We set this speaker on the grass in the corner of the tent on a super hot and humid day, in full sun no less. Not only was the sound phenomenal, it handled the heat and sun as well. Despite the sad occasion, everyone was super impressed with the quality of sound.",5,1,2018-5-26,1,0,0

It is actually a lovely speaker and I am amazed it plays happily on my humid and sometimes misty patio.For my purposes I bought 1 to test using on my Amazon Dot.  It took me forever to figure out how to connect it, which was actually only about a 60-second process.

"This item very simply  connected to my phone so simply, I didn’t even read the instructions. However this was the second one I purchased in a year and I do not know what happened to the last one having what I thought was a short shelflife. Perhaps there is a battery it runs on the  aside from the regular charging that just gives out eventually. I do not have an answer. I have blasted this thing through the house and walked around and can’t believe the beautiful volumes and sound quality. So even with problems I bought it twice and I’ve recommended it to countless others. For the money and reading the raving number of reviews it just can’t be beat. Top quality.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"I bought this to give my Echo Show 5 a little more volume, but the middle volume level is actually quieter than the Echo. The microphone is not good.

Also, the Bluetooth disconnects whenever a Skype call comes in.I won't be able to use it as I intended, so hopefully it serves as a good portable speaker next summer.

"I've always used my phone outside the shower and with the door closed, it just wasn't enough to hear the music. I decided to purchase this as it looked like what I wanted. I charged it prior to using it (one pet peeve for me is there is no green light indicator showing it's fully charged. The red light will blink while charging and stay solid red when charged). Bluetooth was easy to connect to and it connects flawlessly with ease and stays connected. The speakers give out very good sound for the size of the product. I used it in the shower so it did get wet. After my shower is complete, I pat it dry just in case plus I don't want any soap stains to accumulate. The surface all around is very smooth and feels good. The battery has lasted over 4 hours (I have not tried to use it longer so I don't know the full battery length) so it's good enough for what I use it for.",5,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0

It's fallen so many times from at least 6 or 7 feet and never broke.  It still charges and plays for a good amount of time. (It doesn't hold a charge like it did when I first got it, but plays a long amount of time still). Fully charged, it's super loud.  When it hits like 10% or 15% battery it doesn't play as loud but still loud enough.  I believe it does it to extend that last little amount of battery. Lol but idk.  All-in-all... I'd buy this again in a heartbeat when I need a new one!",5,1,2017-7-20,1,1,0
"Quick ship and the price was right, so we bought a pair one for the wife and I.  Each connected to our respective phones straight away and the sound is BOOMING loud.  Under the Bluetooth screen on the phone, the battery level for the speaker is indicated, nice touch.  Just received, so I can't weigh in on battery life yet, but I would recommend.  If you are the type to measure decibels with a sound meter and compare the bass on this speaker to your Volkswagen GTI with the two 12"" woofers in the back--move on, this won't satisfy your needs.You want something that won't break the bank and works--you could do a lot worse that this little music box.

An red light comes on when it's charging, but there's no kind of indication that it is fully charged. I'll leave in plugged in for 12+ hours in hopes that it will have a decent charge. I don't think the battery life has ever lasted to what is claimed and now it's gotten downright awful.

"I can't believe how great this little speaker is! I was not expecting the amazing quality of speaker in such a cheap package. I like it better then many small speakers that cost 3-4 times as much. It is loud, reliable, and has an amazingly long battery life. There is also the bonus that it is water resistant, so you can bring it in the shower. This little thing is also very tough. I had this fall of a 6ft high shelf several times on a hard floor, and I have seen minimal damage occur. If you want a little cheap speaker, this is the clear decision! Just pull the trigger and buy it, you won't be disappointed.",5,1,2018-5-7,1,0,0
"I've been using this little speaker for several months now and I love it!  It sounds great and I'm really picky when it comes to my sound being from the broadcast industry.  It has a quirk or two (nothing to be alarmed about) that you'll be able to overcome if you have any knowledge at all of how these things work. I found that it connects with Bluetooth easily and quickly. If Bluetooth isn't available, I suggest you get a couple of these items when you order: 3.5mm Audio Cable, CAM-ULATA 2.5 Feet Auxiliary Retractable Male to Male Stereo Audio AUX Extension Cable Cord with Gold Plated Connectors for Car iPhone Samsung MP3 DVD Player, 3 Pack.  At lease, get something similar.  You'll use them with this speaker, and with other electronics, as well.  I recommend this speaker.

"I wanted something cheap but not too cheap. Something that would last as my last bluetooth speaker I had stopped working one day. I find this to be of pretty good quality. The battery life is actually really long. The main complaint I have is about volume control. The volume is solely reliant on the device you are playing from. There is no up/down on the actual speaker. A little frustrating at times, but hey, it's cheap and it gets the job done pretty well. So I'd recommend it if you're looking for something good quality but not too expensive",4,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0

I tried it out when I got it and it sure sounded good to me but I knew she would be much more critical than I am! I finally talked to her today about it! She has been listening to it for at least 6 hours a day for about 7 weeks now. She brings it with her when she travels and plays it through her IPhone 5s... Here is her report:1) It sounds AWESOME. The base is AWESOME.  She actually put it on in the kitchen and sat it on the microwave..I went into the other room and through the cupboards, the space and the cookbooks, MY WALL WAS VIBRATING!!! Yup, that is base!!",5,1,2016-2-11,1,0,0
"For the price its more than acceptable, it is built solidly and has good battery life.  The cover over the aux input and power input is just a rubber flap and with heavy use I wouldn't expect it to last.

It's about the size of my hand. Perfect for pool parties or a BBQ outside, even louder when indoors in a living room for example. When I first received it the battery was dead but after about an hour or so I was able to play it while still having it charging. It has a convenient stop/play button that's useful if your showering. I haven't tried to see if it is completely waterproof but I have had water spilled on it from showering and being by the pool and it's been fine.

I did a fair amount of research for the first one I bought, and it seemed to be good quality at a good price. I've been very happy with my own speaker. The sound quality is good, it boosts the volume of my device of choice, and it works well on bluetooth. Even at full volume I've not had any distortion. I don't know how long the battery holds up. The power button is a little tricky, and I keep leaving mine on. I've learned to carry the cord to plug it in.

I've had speakers in the past that have been pretty low and quality due to the price but I find that this speaker is a great price for Great Sound. Basically this speaker has a base and produces kind of a surround sound of music and it holds a charge for a pretty good amount of time I've never had issues with the music becoming distorted or fading in and out. I also like that it has a large range of how loud it can get which is perfect for any type of situation whether you want music to fall asleep to or you're hosting a party and you'd like to have music kind of fill the area. I definitely would recommend the speaker to all of my friends!,5,1,2019-6-8,1,0,0
"Very surprised with this. I bought it to use at work and I needed something rugged and the water resistance helps a lot. I didn't expect studio quality, but this is pretty great for $25. Been using it for a while now and it's stood up to drops on concrete floors. It sounds good even wrapped in a bag and it stays connected from long distances, which is great for me. Sound wise, it seems to put out rock and metal better than hip hop or electronic music based on what I've played through it. The mini-sub on the bottom takes care of the bass and makes it pop out very well. Would highly recommend if you want something good for cheap.",5,1,2018-4-10,1,0,0
"This speaker has excellent sound quality even at very high volumes. I commonly use it at work to listen to music (I work freight at the home depot where there are fork lifts going everywhere and loud fans that create a lot of noise) and I generally have my volume between half and 3 quarters and I can hear it crystal clear. It has a passive subwoofer in the bottom which allows the bass to be amplified without getting distorted. The battery life is beyond anything I expected. I've used it at almost full volume for 10 hours straight without charging it and it still hadn't died. I charged it that night so I knew out would work the next day so I've honestly never killed the battery. I don't know how much longer it would have lasted but 10 hours is very impressive for such a small and loud speaker.

It is compact but produces very decent sound beating anything in the sub $50 range but it will not have deep bass like the expensive Bose or JBL.

The rubberized exterior is water resistant so you can actually take it to the pool or the beach.

Battery life per charge is very good compared to other bluetooth speakers I have owned.  Nice feature is that speaker can be used while charging cable is hooked up.  My previous bluetooth speaker required the battery be over 50% charged before it would play with the charger plugged in.  For this price, you get a really nice durable speaker.

I've been an audiophile for years and I'm hard to please but this small speaker seems to defy physics. Its small, loud with good clear fidelity yet I can hold it in one hand and is self powered. Exceptional device.",5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"I bought this for my boyfriend so he could listen to Pandora on his drive to work. He enjoys the sound quality and says it easily connects to his phone. The only complaint he had was that every now and then the sound will cut out, but overall he enjoys the quality and volume and gave it 4 stars for that reason.We haven't had to test the durability as it hasn't been dropped or exposed to water, but it does survive the wear and tear of long bumpy car rides and dramatic temperature changes (we've recently had days that were well below zero) as he leaves it on the dashboard of his car.",4,1,2018-2-4,1,0,0
I couldn't be more pleased.  The speaker is strong and clear and the instructions were excellent.  I'm loving the clarity and the volume isn't all bad either.  This speaker is the best I can expect for the affordability.  When I am ready for more volume I'll purchase another from this same company.  I love their product. UPDATE:  It is not what you want to use for phone calls.,4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I bought this because sometimes I use my iphone to stream Netflix and for audiobooks, and sometimes the volume is low. Today I tried the speaker for the first time and could tell no difference between the speaker at its maximum volume, and iPhone without the speaker.

"Purchased it a week ago. First I was very happy with my purchase, but today it does not play music. I see it as ""headphones sign"" in my list of Bluetooth but when it pairs it looks like a phone sign and it says ""call audio"". So as a result, it only makes a sound if somebody calls me or I call. All other sounds are on the phone only. I've tried to reset it, turn off/on Bluetooth - nothing works. When I connect audio cable it works perfectly but this is not why I purchased this product - I need the wireless connection.",1,1,2017-10-19,1,1,0
"This is a music player, not made for video or phone chat. I brought this thinking it could help with increasing the volume control while I video chat with my friends since it had a mic, but it was worthless in that department. The mic work, but it act more like a recorder, repeating my own voice back to me, instead of getting what I say across to the other party or reverse.  Using it to listen to music is still good and it does improve the volume when I watch movie on my ipad.",3,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"I'm a truck driver and would listen to music on my phone through my headset - I've never had good luck with aux jacks.  When my ear became sore I looked into getting a portable speaker.  The reviews on this product were mostly positive so I decided to give it a try.I've owned my speaker a week now and I love it!  It's surprisingly loud, I have never put the volume all the way up on it.  I'm not crazy about base but you can definitely tell it has it.  Pairing it was as simple as pushing the Bluetooth button and pairing on my phone. 10/10 would recommend if you want something small and simple but powerful.",5,1,2017-8-24,1,1,1
"I received the Oontz Angle 3 speaker about 4 1/2 months.  Use it mostly for listening to books on tape (very clear for voices).  Also use it for Pandora music and speaker sounds very good and also a little bass for such a small speaker.  After 4+ months the speaker kept shutting off when I would sync it to my device.  Thought battery was low so I charged it overnight.  Next day tried 4x and after it would sync it worked about 15 seconds before the speaker would just shut off.  Contacted company figuring I would get the usual ""sorry you are having issues but there is nothing we can do"".  HOWEVER, I received ""Sorry you are having an issue let us send you a new one to resolve the issue"".  Amazing a company with FANTASTIC customer service.  I didn't think that existed anymore.  Since this company backs up their products I will probably get a couple of these for the kids for them to listen to there music and books.  THANKS!",5,1,2016-4-15,1,0,0
"This is my original review: ""Small, convenient, good sound for the price. Bluetooth works smoothly with my new iPod nano."" I mostly use it when I'm listening to audiobooks at night. A few weeks after this review was written, it began snipping off words. I complained and was told it was a firmware problem that had been fixed. Cambridge sent me a replacement. After some time passed, I purchased a second one to keep in another room. It worked fine for six months and then the power on/off switch failed. This is likely the same problem some people have described as ""won't charge."" So I now have one that snips off words, one (their replacement) that works okay so far, and a newer one that won't stay cut on. A dead black block. It's too bad because I love these things. Don't get too attached to them unless you're okay with spending $30 every 4-6 months to buy a new one.",2,1,2016-1-13,1,1,0

The sound is also far, far superior.",1,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0

"It’s decent, but if you use it regularly (I use it when I shower and get ready in the morning), it’s not going to last very long. I rarely use it longer than an hour, but I do use it many days a week (though sometimes not all). It worked for a little less than a year, so not super impressive, though not devastating. Sound is decent, connectivity is decent. About what you’d expect from something at this price.",3,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
Now this one is high quality at a very reasonable price. There are a ton of features on it and the user book is highly detailed with pictures and very easy to follow.

"Better than my Bose computer speakers I bought 8 years ago that were wired from a value perspective . Better than the UWE's I loved and bought for my girlfriend in 2014 , and probably better than anything anyone can buy for $25 . Louder than my UWE's were and connects faster and simpler . My second review because I am raving this morning about how great the volume is . People will want to buy more than one for family members or connect with computers, phones, or tablets in more than one room . Should win the design of the year.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"Fantastic speaker for the money. I used this thing for the first time and was actually IMPRESSED by it's quality. Come on dude it's $25 it can handle splashes and it pairs up mega easy. The buttons are very high quality and have a nice click and response. I take this thing to the shower, use it when cleaning my room and wow the bass makes it legit almost slide off my desk if I don't clean the nice sticky base pads on it that ground it to the desk. That's just me being lazy and having dust stick to the foot pads on it but hey i can't complain this has so much bass for a little bluetooth speaker that it vibes off my desk. :)",5,1,2018-3-2,1,0,0

I bought these based on a user review who said they can be paired to play 2 speakers at the same time.They can't. I don't blame the company. It's my fault for not researching it further.,3,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
When I received the product it was smaller than I thought it would be. It's about the size of a 12oz soda can. It was easy to set up the bluetooth connection. I was surprised by the sound. I used it in my garage and the sound was great for such a small device. It would work just as well on the patio. The volume can be adjusted either on the device or using your phone. They work independent of each other.,5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"Got this for $28, free shipping (when I purchased something else).  I currently have a Jawbone Mini Jambox.. so kind of have the bar set a bit high owning that for a few years and it coming in at $50 back then.This is very clever and a neat design.  It was fun to play around with (being a tech nerd), and was very simple to pair.  However, the sound input isn't the best.  I would say, very equivalent to a cheaper bluetooth speaker you could buy at a drug store.  So, if you're looking for something great sounding, upgrade to a better speaker.  But, for what my wife needed it for, it does the job at a price that can't be beat!",4,1,2017-4-1,1,1,0
"I was duly impressed with this speaker when it arrived.  How on earth could they get such GREAT sound out of such a small device?  And how could they sell it for less than $30?But yesterday I forgot that I had balanced the speaker on the cover to the hot tub.  When I went to close it the speaker took a dive into hot, chlorinated spa water.  I scooped it out as quickly as I could, but I assumed that it would be kaput.",5,1,2017-5-7,1,1,0
"LOVE this. My husband is a farmer and we have several farms. He needed a speaker that could bounce around with him in his truck and survive the dirt in a barn. This is perfect! In fact, my father was over and he is very finicky about sound systems etc. He played in the Cleveland Orchestra. We wanted to see what he'd say about it, just for fun! Lol. When he walked in the house we had the Star Wars theme tract playing at a pretty good volume. He immediately asked if we had new speakers in the house and almost fell over when we showed him the hand sized speaker that was producing such good sound! Excellent buy! I bought the case for it which has been great.",5,1,2017-1-2,1,1,0
"This is the first bluetooth speaker I've tried so these are a newbie's reactions.  The ""100' range"" is misleading in my opinion.  Apparently bluetooth signal is a line of sight function so I can't link this to my desktop computer in the back of my home and use the speaker 40' away in my garage shop.  For reasons known only to the Gods of Tech the WiFi I'm supposed to have doesn't seem to help. Worked just as advertised  when close to the desktop or linked to an iPhone within arm's reach.  Simple, intuitive controls.  It feels durable and has already survived a couple of falls on hard surfaces.",4,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
Recently purchased this for a trip to Cancun so I can jam out on the beach. First of the feel and quality of this is excellent. It feels well built and solid with grips on the bottom for slippery surfaces. The battery life is amazing on a full charge it lasted me 8 hours on the volume all the way up in the heat and had humidity of Cancun. The sound it crisp and clear and pretty loud for the size of this little thing. It connects to effortlessly to any phone or iPod. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a portable speaker.,5,1,2017-5-30,1,2,0
"This thing never worked great right out of the box. The sound wasn’t that good at all. I should’ve returned it, but it worked off n on so I didn’t.  After about the 7th time using it, it would continually lose connection and shut off.  So frustrating.  Like I say, it’s never worked right and isn’t even worth the $20 we paid.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,1,0
"The sound for this relatively inexpensive device is great. I often use it as a kind of ""pillow speaker."" I'll bring up a program on radio dot com, usually the news, before I fall asleep, then set a timer for, perhaps, 30-45 minutes, and my phone cuts off the program and the Bluetooth speaker times out...the battery lasts quite a long time before recharging. It synchs up really easily as well.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"The speaker was definitely a bit smaller than I was expecting but it is astounding! I work at Jack in the Box and it can get VERY loud. This speaker makes it so that we have to shout to hear each other with the volume up all the way. I love it! The battery life is awesome, too. I had it playing at full volume for a good 8-9 hrs straight and it never once said it was running low. When I got home I plugged it in to charge and it took about 2 hrs, which is understandable for how I was using it. I got it with a case and an extra long wall cord just in case. I love it all. The speaker I had before was a cheap little one that was never loud enough and this one surpassed it in every possible way! There's no comparrison.

"I was in search of a beach/garage/portable/bluetooth/aux cable/loud/water resistant/take-a-beating/affordable speaker. Turns out there are a ton of options. So review after review I tried to compare price vs the options. After spending what was probably far too long for something as insignificant as an ""affordable"" speaker that may or may not stand my abuse I chose this one. Thus far I am very happy with my purchase.I have yet to test it on the beach but it the sound from this speaker is great. It is directional but with the volume it emits I don't believe this is much of a con. So far from either bluetooth or AUX cable the has been no difference or issue with sound. The battery seems to last forever, or at least long enough for me to get drunk or finish working on my car.",5,1,2016-1-10,1,0,0
"This thing's great. I bought it to listen to music while I was in the shower and it's been perfect for that. It's plenty loud enough to hear when it's set on my counter and the water is running. The charge lasts a nice long time. I've used it for 5-6 days (while showering), haven't noticed any decrease in volume, and haven't had to recharge it yet. It's got a much fuller sound than I was expecting. I'm giving it 5 stars but if I could change anything, I'd wish it were taller and narrower but still with the slanted speaker face. It takes up a touch more real estate on my bathroom counter than I'd like but still very tolerable.",5,1,2017-3-4,1,1,0
"Honestly best speaker I could’ve bought. I bought this speaker 3 years ago in 2016, it’s so great I have never even considered buying a new one. I love it. I bought it to take outside and use at the pool, the big selling point for me was that it’s water proof. But man, that’s not the only good thing about it! It’s got AMAZING sound quality, I don’t think in the 3 years of me having it that I have ever turned it all the way up. I use it at pool parties, barbecues, and house parties. It’s so small and discreet that’s I can just shove it into my purse if I think we may end up going somewhere like the beach or park. I love it and it’s worked amazing ever since I got it!",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"My phone has a better sound that this speaker.  Today, the second time I used it, there was no sound.  It connected, but no sound.  To return it, it seems that I had to pay shipping.

"If I'd spent $100 on this, I'd give it one star.  But for the price of a dinner entree, it's a reasonable deal.  The sound isn't great, but it's there, and if it's positioned right, you can get some respectable bass response.  I've seen/heard far better bluetooth speakers, but they also cost far more.

"I am a teacher at a infant and toddler Montessori school. During nap times, speakers are the most important thing next to a nap mat. This speaker gets extremely loud!!! It easily drowns out the screams and cries of some children trying to resist their naps and allows the other children to go to sleep. (it's hard to go to sleep when all you hear is your friend crying) I like that you can skip the current song by holding down the volume up button. The battery is decent, it will play all day on a full charge. But needs to be plugged in everyday after use. I love how inexpensive this speaker is and how loud it is that I bought one for myself immediately after. With one speaker being used everyday, we shall see how long it lasts without needing to be constantly plugged in or any other possible issue. However, after a month of everyday constant use, it is still alive.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0

I have been using it for a week or so as a way to listen to music in bed and the shower. I don't put it in the shower but I guess you could. It sounds great and looks nice too. I think it sounds as good as some way higher priced speakers. I will be purchasing a few more as gifts for my family. The only reason for 4 stars instead of five was because I need to sometimes get on my playback device to make it synch. I am not really familiar with Bluetooth devices so this might be something you have to do with all Bluetooth devices. It works great in my bedroom and today if it is nice out I will test it out while my car.

"Actually pleasantly surprised with the quality of the speaker. I use it mostly when I want to take a shower or if I am going to be doing some cleaning in a part of the house where my computer speakers don't reach. They serve as a great substitute and can become surprisingly loud. Battery life seems to be perfectly fine too; I've used it a few times for probably a total of an hour and a half and it seems like it still has a few hours of battery life on it. Probably not the best solution if someone needs the device for a very long extended period, though there are also ways around that. Works perfect for my needs.",5,1,2018-3-8,1,0,0
"I bought this to connect to my phone to allow me to listen to an audio book on a long drive (16 hours).  The unit could connect via bluetooth or directly with the enclosed micro connector.  I can not speak to how long the charge holds, as I had it plugged into a car USB adapter so I would not need to worry about it running out on long drive.  I had it sitting in the middle console between the driver and passenger with the speakers facing up.  At full volume on both my phone (moto x) and the speaker, it was at a good level, but wished it could go a little louder, as there were times the narration was a little quiet.  Did play briefly with some music and it sounded very good.  I am sure the volume would be very good when not in the noisy environment of a traveling car.  Again, I wish it were slightly louder, but for the price it was a very good purchase.",5,1,2016-7-22,1,0,0

Within an hour of posting the above review I was contacted by the seller and offered a replacement. I have used the replacement for 6+ months and do like it: he sound has a much better balance (although not at all bass heavy.)

"Got it for my car...which predates bluetooth or even aux inputs and didn't want to deal with getting a new stereo.  The size is good and the triangular shape gives me plenty of options for mounting.  It's made pretty well.  Haven't tested battery life since I intend to have it connected to the USB power all the time, which does bring me to one of two cons.  The USB connector comes directly out of one of the triangle sides on one end.  It just makes the unit with the USB connected less ""positionable"", if you get my meaning.  Would have been better if it came directly out of one of the ends...or maybe need to find a USB male end that's got a 90 degree bend.The other issue has more impact...the sound.  Overall, it's clear, not muddy.  But there is hardly any bass.  I've no idea what a ""passive subwoofer"" is in the context of this unit, but it doesn't sound like there's any speaker that's putting out frequencies below 100 Hz (just a guess not an audiophile).

Always sounds kind of high and flat without depth or resonance.  Nothing wrong with it so I can't return it.  Don't hate but don't really like it either.

Been using it for over 6 months and it has a good battery life and plenty loud for any apartment or room or RV.The Bluetooth will sync up to anyone's Bluetooth no problems first try. It will also remember my phone every time I use it which is often. It is true the base is strong enough to bounce it off a table if you turn it up all the way.

You can use it while it is charging, but I prefer not to do that too often with electronics. Recently, we had my son's birthday at a park. I used this speaker to play some of his favorite songs along with some children's songs. Very affordable and compact. It sits on our bookshelf and is barely noticeable. I would certainly recommend this speaker.",5,1,2018-8-9,1,0,0
"For the price I'd say you can't do any better!It sounds really good. It's not the loudest and not the best speaker out there, but that's not what I was looking for when I bought this. I can hear it in the shower and it fills up my a dining room during dinner.",4,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
"Awesome sound quality, can't believe this is so cheap.  Plenty of volume, bass, everything.  Battery life is great too.  Only minor inconvenience is that when you're charging it, there is no way to know whether it's done charging.  You can leave it on and stay connected to it and your phone will read out the battery life, but it would be cool if it had a light that flashed or stayed on when done.Otherwise, very good speaker.  Bought two now.",5,1,2019-8-15,1,0,0
"I'll admit when I saw the package I thought, crap this is not going to be good.  Well I opened it up, got it paired with my phone quite easily and started listening.....IT MAY BE SMALL BUT ITS MIGHTY FOR ITS SIZE!! Very satisfied, matter of fact so satisfied I ordered my wife one.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,2,0
"Spontaneously turns itself off whenever it decides it's not making enough noise, which includes while still playing music low but clearly enough to hear.  Doesn't maintain volume settings so you're constantly having to adjust between computer and onboard controls.  Develops random crackles and electrical noises that require a power-off to stop.  Volume wanders where it chooses with a range more or less what you've asked for.Barely tolerable when it's not in the middle of a snit fit.  Don't buy this thing if you want any kind of reliability.",2,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0

I was amazed that this type of device could be produced for less than $20.  I found out you still get what you pay for..  I got $5. sound quality and a rapid failure within days of first use.. It now only produces squawks even after going through the mating process repeatedly..  Thanks to Amazon for the Kohls return or I would have thrown it in the trash.. This device  is just not worth the aggravation.,1,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I had received an email asking me what I thought about the speaker. The email included a request to contact the seller if I had any questions or concerns. Thinking that the slight lag between my echo dot and the Oontz angle was an idiosyncrasy of a Bluetooth speaker, I simply conveyed my disappointment over sometimes having the speaker cut off the beginning of a response made to echo.Well, it seemed like literally minutes when I received a response explaining what was likely the issue and that if my address was correct and I wanted the offered solution of a replacement, they would send me one asap. I was very pleased and accepted their offer and within days received the replacement. It works flawlessly and meets my needs in the bedroom. Best part? Sitting in my massage chair and asking echo to play nature sounds whilst I get a great massage. Great speaker, great company.",5,1,2016-6-17,1,0,0
Can’t beat the price for the sound quality. I would say the quality can be compared to a Bose by speaker. I have the 2nd gen and this version is clearly a difference in size and sound quality. Would recommend those who want to buy a sound bar but don’t want to dish out near the $100 for the “top” brands that provide the somewhat same quality as this bt speaker.,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"All the features work and it's a convenient, portable size.  No bass to speak of but that was expected.  What was not expected was how much the high end was over-amped and tinny sounding.  You need some serious EQing to lower all the high end frequencies to make it acceptable for listening.  After Heavy EQing, it's ok.  Read my reviews with confidence - have never accepted a bribe (free products for reviewing) in over 10 years on Amazon.",3,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"I'm giving this speaker 4 stars because for the money, it's quite good. Look, if you want to spend $150 to $250 for a UE megaboom speaker, you'll get a lot more bass and power, like a great home speaker would give. But you'll also spend many times more. If you want to listen to music in your bedroom, in the kitchen while you're cleaning up, in the garage while you're waxing the car, etc. this won't disappoint for the money. As others have pointed out, it's kind of hard to find the power button but they have a sticker to help you. Charge lasts for quite a while, too.",4,1,2017-7-17,1,1,0
"I used this speaker in the shower, where it wasn't directly sprayed with water (only indirectly). After 4 months it just started beeping and died completely. It only had a 90 day warranty, so there's nothing I can do about it.It looks like the glue that was supposed to hold down the rubber foot next to the charging port flap was improperly applied (its the only place it was glued down), so a small gap opened up from opening and closing the flap and water got in. Obviously they knew that was the weakpoint in the ingress protection so they added glue as a ""fix"", but they don't care enough to do proper QC on it.",1,1,2016-11-22,1,1,0
"I wasn't expecting much for the cost - but I'm quite pleasantly surprised! I don't use the speaker everyday, but the battery has lasted for weeks. I listen to my PodCasts for a few hours several times a week; I play my music several times a week (while riding in my golf cart with the volume turned up) and I still haven't had to recharge the batter since my first charge. I like the triangle design because it feels sturdy on my golf cart dashboard; it has rubber-type grips on the bottom; it has an easy on/off switch on the top and it has an auto shut off if you forget to turn the speaker off. The volume is capable of getting quite loud and the sound seems quite pure. Of course, it's not equal to the more expensive speakers; but for the price, I highly recommend this item.",5,1,2017-2-17,1,0,0
"I am an avid outdoors kind of girl.  I live in Alaska and it rains here a lot.  It snows and is cold as you can imagine.  I take this bad boy 4 wheeling and to the beach with me often. I have also used it at work and around the house.  It's loud, guys!  It has quite the delivery sound wise, especially in any enclosed space.  Decent base and sound quality is solid.  It withstands the rigors of the harsh life I subject it to also.  Setting it up was a breeze.  I had Bluetooth on my phone,  turned on this beast and it synched within a minute.  It came charged pretty well because I played a good hour of music right out of the box.  I charged it for about 3 hours and a week later it was still going strong. It's lightweight so when I hike or camp this will be my go to sound equipment.  Overall,  I think this is a great buy.",5,1,2018-4-13,1,0,0
"I recently ordered and received the ""FUGOO Tough - Portable Rugged Bluetooth Wireless Go Anywhere Speaker Waterproof Shockproof Mud-proof Snow-proof"" 2 weeks prior to arrival of this OontZ Angle Bluetooth Speaker - I ordered both bluetooths for 2 close friends (we live in tiny islands in central Pacific Ocean, Marshall Islands).  These 2 bluetooth are great for the islands as it may rain any minute of a day, especially for fishing purposes, rain or shine.  For one thing in comparison, this OontZ is not only cost less, but also the sound is much more stronger, louder, even with more bass. Incredible! Now, I am about to order one more OontZ for myself. I highly recommend this Oontz for its tough-ness, small size, sound quality, and price.Update as of June 29, 2016: Ever satisfied and love this OontZ bluetooth. Neighbors are so impressed with this bluetooth that 2 already requested I order for them. Totally awesome little bluetooth",5,1,2016-4-15,1,0,0
"As many people mentioned there is a buzz sound. That happens when you use aux-in and has the power constantly plugged in. I'm surprised they didn't even solve this basic issue before calling it a product.For people use only Bluetooth connect, I think this is a ok product with price tag under $20. But to use it as a PC speaker will be a definitely NO.",2,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
I am planning a movie night for my sons birthday.  I purchased this to pair with my iPhone to use for the audio in place of the audio from the projector system. Its perfect!!  If you are familiar with pairing Bluetooth devices you will be able to set this up easily.  I have tested this at all volumes levels and I must say I was impressed with the sound quality for the price.  I was  attempting to secretly test the movie projection and audio set up in the living room  while my son was sleeping in the bedroom.. a few rooms away.. and well...the audio woke him up. He jumped out of bed and came running asking why is the music so loud lol  This thing gets LOUD! It definitely is powerful for its small size.  I give it 5 stars.,5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
I bought this as a last minute cheap replacement for a Bose I misplaced. Let me tell you the quality and durability of this speaker is hands down the best I’ve had. It says it can withstand small sprays of water but not submerged.. this thing went fully under water for about a minute. It took about an hour to dry out but started working again at the same quality it had before it fell in the creek while going down a rapid. I cannot day enough great things about this speaker! If this one ever goes out on me I know I will buy another one,5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"This speaker is everything the item description said it was and more. I'm not an expert but I do know that this little speaker really puts out quality sound in all the sound frequencies. The highs are clean and crisp. The lows are just right and very surprising for a speaker this size. How does it do it, I don't know but it just does. Also at high volume (which is more than ample) there is virtually very little to no distortion.The more part to this speaker is with regards to the company Cambridge SoundWorks. They not only have great products but the customer service is above and beyond. Cambridge SoundWorks is very gracious and will take care of any issues you may have. This company really does know how to conduct good business practices, something that's becoming rarer and rarer in the business world of today. You can buy products from them with great confidence knowing that you will be taken care of.  Thank you Cambridge SoundWorks,  you and your products ROCK!!!",5,1,2016-7-29,1,0,0
"Even though I've read lots of positive reviews, I was still skeptical as I've never seen anything as cheap as this product work anywhere close to the advertised abilities.While I have not tested the ""making it wet"" aspect of it, everything else about it lives up true to its name. So much so that we even bought 2 more of these about a month later. They work better then some of the things that cost 3 times the amount that you find in the local brick and mortar stores. So far nothing negative to say about it (probably evident by the 5 star rating). Keeping an eye out to see if maybe it breaks 6 months to a year down the line or with water or something else but overall very happy with what I've seen thus far.",5,1,2016-5-12,1,0,0
"I originally bought this for use near the pool to stream music from my iPhone (which stayed in a safe and dry location).

"This speaker has been NOTHING but a headache right out of the box and has only gotten more problematic from there.  It's fine *when* it actually works, which is rare and invariably requires 15 minutes of fiddling with it first.  I have to uninstall and reinstall every single time I want to use it.  We gave up trying to make that work and just wired it to the headphone jack, and that actually made it WORSE.  So now I've got a USB port dedicated to this speaker so that it stays charged, and a headphone jack dedicated to it as well, and now it just produces a high-pitched hum.  Nothing else.  Just a constant screech when it's turned on.Meanwhile, hubby has a Bose that has worked perfectly for years on end and has 10x the sound quality this thing has on its best day.

I've also brought it to work so I can listen to my Amazon Prime stations in lieu of the boom box they have there. It's so nice to be able to listen to the music I choose instead of what's otherwise available. The sound is surprisingly good and I get a lot of compliments. I'll bet I've sold a few to people who've been there when I fired it up. I can't claim to be a sound expeet, but I'm quite happy with this speaker.",5,1,2017-11-10,1,1,0
"EXCELLENT unit for the price! The cone on my bass speaker recently gave up the ghost. Not wanting to spend $300 for speaker and labor, I decided to order this unit and Bluetooth it to my phone. Placing the Angle 3 on the dash directly below my Roadmate Nav System was the obvious choice for its new home. With the reflective properties of the dash and the window, the unit sounds like a $150 Bose. One little problem, not sure why but periodically it tends to uncouple with the phone. There are a lot of signals coming in near the unit which might be the problem. Indoors, there is no signal lose. Provides a nice sound outdoors for gatherings. TRY IT ~ YOU'LL LIKE IT! Get one quick while you can still trade with China. The same unit made in America will probably cost $100+",4,1,2017-1-23,1,0,0
"A little shocked at how loud this little thing is, and it's tiny.  Battery life not amazing, decent.  If you want something to hook up to a phone for boom box effect that will fit in a pocket or backpack, these are worth it.  I have a few different micro speakers like this being used as satellite speakers in my studio apartment and bluetooth doesn't play nice with more than 2 devices.  Syncing and warbling from crowded signal makes then a little rough but used individually sound is excellent.",5,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
Good design. Great sound quality.  Unable to use after three months.  Won't connect to Bluetooth.  This is the second one of these units to do this (other one lasted over a year).  Unusable at this point. I now have two useless speakers.  Disappointed.,1,1,2019-11-9,1,1,0

No kidding we got a little rowdy, turned it up all the way, and I could hear it clearly from the other side of the beach... Huge sound from a small device. If you're looking for a splash proof speaker to use around the pool, look no further. Also the batter lasted about two days without me needing to charging it. (Probably 10-12 hours). Bluetooth went out about 20 feet away from my phone, not bad.",5,1,2016-10-5,1,2,0
When it first arrived I couldn't believe how small it was and thought this is really going to sound horrible. I was so wrong. The speaker produces very good quality of Sound and Bass and reaches good volume levels. Get it fits in the palm of your hand and easy to take with you. I bought it for my wife cuz she likes to shower and have music in the bathroom. This speaker really does a great job and for the price it makes an excellent gift.

I think it exactly what I expected in terms of size, battery life and sound output.. I wanted it small and in my budget, so I knew I was not going to get thumping bass - or even ""solid"" bass like a larger speaker driver in a larger enclosure would provide. The sound that is produced is really great for where it came from! My friends with larger BT speakers have been impressed, and one even bought one that night - he was interested in the portability this one provides - and the volume!Since all of that is very subjective, and if you are not sure about it, remember that Cambridge SoundWorks has a very good reputation in audio.",5,1,2016-11-22,1,0,0
"I listen to either podcasts or the radio (via TuneIn Pro) every morning during my shower routine and I've been looking for a while for a reasonable Bluetooth speaker since the phone-in-the-cup doesn't cut it. I've tried a few different models, but the problem with most of them is volume and/or design. For example, one could adequately provide the volume I needed to hear over the sound of the running shower, but the design was lacking as all of the controls were UNDER the speaker. Another had the controls in the right place, but it isn't water resistant, so I'm sure over time, steamy showers will take its toll.That said, this product completely satisfies all of my needs. It has gets plenty loud (I don't even have to turn it all the way up) and the buttons are big and easy to get to. Plus with it being water resistant, I don't have to worry about either the steam-filled bathroom, or reaching out and adjusting the volume during the shower.",5,1,2015-11-29,1,0,0

"The speaker itself is wonderful. But beware, after only 6 months the battery capacity decreases extremely. It does not become worth it to purchase it since you cannot always use it if you are outside or somewhere where to outlets are available. I would not purchase it again and regret the purchase because it did not even make it one year and the battery life went downhill very fast. Of course, by that time it is too late to return it based on the warranty provided by Amazon.",1,1,2018-2-14,1,1,0

Tried multiple charging connectors and devices.  None worked.  I notice it appears the connection is loose, giving me suspicion that the receiver on the speaker is of poor quality.  I give this product 2-stars because: 1) it's less than $25; and b) for the ""just over"" 90 days that it functioned, it was awesome.  So...it's a disposable speaker, cost about $8/month.  When purchasing, think of it as an $8/month device and decide whether it's worth $8/month to you to have a portable, awesome speaker.",2,1,2018-2-2,1,1,0

For comparison, it's not much louder than my cell phone speaker (iPhone 8) and the sound quality is just ok, although to be fair, my cell phone has a pretty decent speaker.

I also really like the shape of it as well as the fact that it is water-resistant so we can play music near the pool.I did have one problem with this speaker, but it was quickly resolved.  When I tried listening to an audiobook, I found that the first word or so of any sentence that followed even a short pause would be cut off. This made for a very frustrating listening experience, of course. I noted from some of the Amazon reviews that others had noticed the same problem, but I was past my 30-day window for a return to Amazon. So I emailed Cambridge SoundWorks directly and within a day, I was contacted by a very helpful customer service rep who offered to send me a replacement unit with updated firmware that would handle audiobooks.

The OontZ Angle 3 had an incredible amount of reviews raving about the volume so I gave it a shot.  I am impressed....This speaker was WAY louder than my Jambox!  But......The sound quality is no where near optimal.  There is very little bass which I kind of expected from a speaker in this price range so no big deal.  But the sound is also very ""tinny"" especially at high volume, which is always for me.  I am still satisfied with the OontZ Angle 3 solely because of the volume.

They then sent me a new one (free shipping), and included a free carry bag as well. This one has worked flawlessly since. It is quite loud with good volume and pretty good bass. I use it in the shower as I have a TV in the bathroom, and a BT adaptor attached to the TV. I have even had to turn the speaker down while in the shower, so it is pretty loud. It sits on a ledge right under the water spray nozzle so does get wet and has never had an issue. Love this speaker, especially for the shower. I have paired it with a phone, as well, so that works well also. I got it on sale for about $27 so it was an even better deal.",5,1,2017-1-1,1,0,0
I am a coach and used the speaker to play music while warming up.  The little speaker was able to be heard in the entire gym and over the sounds of volleyballs bouncing.  (Gym is one basketball court size) . The clarity was really good for the price.  The speaker connected relatively quickly and never lost connection.  Used 3-4 days a week for about 30 minutes and only had to charge the speaker 2 times during the entire 3 month season.,4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
Can’t hear anything on it. I have to turn the sound on my iPhone all the way to max and then the speaker has to be on the countertop with me in order to hear it. This should be blowing me out of the room. There is no button on the speaker to turn up sound. I listen primarily to podcasts and if I push the “+” button it advances through my podcasts but does not turn up volume.,2,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"I bought the Oontz angle and the hard case to extend the life of the speaker and protect it.  I purchased it in February and by June it would charge inconsistently and by July it died completely.  I like the design, the construction materials and the sound...........WHEN IT PLAYED!!  This is a product that didn't get heavy use that didn't last 6 months.  Durability be damned, if the electronics on a Bluetooth are faulty it doesn't matter what the speaker is made from.  This is a bad product.  Read the negative reviews and you'll see a common thread",2,1,2018-7-29,1,0,0
Update from previous review: the seller contacted me numerous times to work out the sound issue I was having with my Bluetooth connection.It turns out that the problem was in my end. When I followed the advice of the seller the issue was resolved.,5,1,2019-6-10,1,2,0
"The Cambridge Soundworks Oontz Angle 3 came this morning.  It had power right out of the box and I have been playing it for a few hours now.  I set the speaker volume at max and controlled the volume after that with my phone.  This thing produces exceptionally clean and clear sound for such a little speaker!  The extruded triangular design lets you to position the Oontz Angle 3 on its little rubber feet with its speaker aimed towards you reducing the need to crank up the volume.  At low volume levels the bass is not strong, but the sound is so clean!  That said, you can definitely crank this thing up!  I just set the speaker down and walked about 10 feet away and went to max volume and wow!  The bass gets stronger as you increase the volume while maintaining the excellent sound clarity found at the lower volume levels (tested that listening to My Last Breath by Evanescence).  Honestly, it almost hurt my ears even at 10 feet away, and not because it sounded bad!  I don't like super loud music so I turned it down to about 40% volume on my phone and its perfect.  I am super happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone.  Especially at $27.99, which is what I paid!  I love it and the Oontz is now my go-to portable speaker.",5,1,2016-6-18,1,0,0
"The sound quality on this speaker is very good but it never would sync up with my older laptop no matter how much troubleshooting I did. A different brand speaker synced with it right away, so that was disappointing.I do like everything else about this product though. The buttons are easy to find in the dark and are very responsive. I like that it has its own volume control. It's easy to charge and the shape and size of it make it very sturdy and hard to topple over. I also like that it doesn't create a lot of light pollution in the dark. And, of course, the sound quality is really good.",3,1,2017-2-23,1,0,0
"The sound quality is not great and the battery life is awful!! I can get about halfway through the workday while listening to this thing before it needs a charge.

It It works great. I'm using an old cell phone for a bluetooth MP3 player and it connected and re connects easily every day when I use it for entertainment while doing the xword puzzle out on my deck. Judging by other reviews I had expected a little more fidelity with the music. Maybe it is there and these old ears just don't hear it well any more. But it does sound quite good and more than fills the deck with music. I had not expected to use the Bluetooth option but it really is the way to do go. I do wish there was a visible indication of the Oontz's volume level tho.,5,1,2018-5-27,1,0,0
"I had considered purchasing a Bose outdoor bluetooth speaker, but just had a hard time spending that kind of money. I decided to give this little guy a try, just to see if I'd use it enough to justify the expense of a Bose. For what I use it for (on the patio table by the pool), this is perfect. This is obviously not the same quality, but heck, this was less than a quarter of the cost.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"my family has 5 of these and we love them for  their  smaller size and  good sound.  we use the Jackery Giant with them. they work well with our phones as wireless.  and we keep them in the little  cases you can get for them.  We  take them fishing with us. My son  does forging and he  puts one outside with him when working.  WE  take one out to the barn when we are  doing chores.  I got the  big OOntz 3x size as well, and I am happy with that as well,  It is big enough though that it doesn't hold a charge for as long and  doesn't charge using the Jackery Giant since it needs 110 to charge. So these smaller speakers are way more versatile for what you get in sound.  Obviously the bigger one has more sound, but you give up the other  portable features.",5,1,2017-1-11,1,0,0
"Read lots of review before I bought this item and SO FAR I HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS SPEAKER. Comparing the small size of the speaker, It's loud with clear, distinctive quality sound.I've used this speaker for more than 8hrs every day for about a month now and no glitches. From the reviews, the problem most people have with this item is short durability, no complaints about  product quality!",5,1,2016-10-13,1,0,0

"Overall the speaker is nice. It is very small, it can fit inside the palm of an adult hand. The sound is surprisingly loud and there is no distortion at loud volumes.However there really isn't any bass to the noise. There is a somewhat ""thump, thump"" but it is not distinct and does not have a smooth emphasis upon it. I read a couple reviews and it stated the bass in this speaker is good for its size and is clear and surprisingly loud. But that is not at all the case.

"Awesome tiny Bluetooth speaker!Update 9-1-19: This little miracle of a speaker just keeps amazing me. It is so small, but its sound is much bigger. It’ll never be your B&W/SoundLab/Klipsch audiophile speakers but it’s just wonderful as a source of clean sound in the kitchen, or as I’m doing other things. I haven’t had it outside but will soon do so. Holds a charge a long time, too, and takes a charge quickly via micro USB. highly recommend, still! 👍",5,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0
"This speaker is incredible.  The sound is superb, especially for its size.  It can be driven loud enough to room-filling sound level in my 2-car garage!  And without distortion.  It has very good highs and mid-range and respectable bass.  The sound will dependent, somewhat, on the surface and any back panel used for reflecting surfaces.  Placing it in the corner of a room or where there are 3 surfaces that can act as reflectors makes for the best sound environment.And it is so small that I can throw it in our travel bags for use when we travel, especially on a cruise.",5,1,2016-12-18,1,0,0
"I had purchased the oontz angle 2 previously and have loved it. I was trying to buy another one to leave in my car but saw this water proof one on sale so thought it would be better to take tailgating, on hikes, picnics, bbqs, etc. It’s smaller than the oontz angle 2 and i had high hopes but sound quality isn’t as good. The bass isn’t as deep and it sounds less balanced (i.e. more treble and less bass) than the oontz angle 2. my mom liked it so i gave it to her. I’d recommend the oontz angle 2 for better sound quality.",3,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"Great little Bluetooth speaker with surprisingly good sound. Very easy and convenient to set up, use and carry with you. What is truly exceptional is the GREAT customer service! My speaker was working fine for a month then it would not connect to my phone or laptop. I emailed customer service and to my surprise I received a friendly response within hours. Craig from Cambridge SoundWorks had me try multiple options to troubleshoot my issue. He always followed up with an email to see how and if his procedures worked. After multiple attempts Craig apologized for my inconvenience and said he was sending me another speaker at no charge! I was amazed how easy it was to work with this gentleman. In these days (daze) of automated emails, call menus and no responses I received quality customer service like I spent thousands of dollars on equipment!

"This is my 2nd Oontz Angle Speaker.  The 1st One worked great.  Never had a problem with it until the battery went bad and I could only use it if it was plugged in.  I liked it so much I bought another one.  That was a mistake!  2 months and hardly used.  It started out being hard to pair, now it won't pair at all and it's past the return.

"I used this to replace a Braven 570 that has worked flawlessly for me the last 5 years.  For the money, this isn't bad because if you are on the beach or somewhere there is a lot of noise outdoors, it is fine if you just want some music.  Where I don't like it is in the garage or in the house.  It really does not have a lot of mid range and seems to be mostly treble.  There is also a very distorted sound to it at lower to moderate volume levels.  If you are just going to use this outdoors and not car too much what happens to it, this may be your speaker.  If you are looking for quality sound, spend more money and get you something different.  It does provide sound and does indeed get loud, but the quality of the sound is low to mediocre at best.",3,1,2017-11-3,1,0,0

Even at mid level it sounded great compared to size. Definitely a keeper.Battery life is really good.

I had issues with my speaker and I sent an email for troubleshooting help.  The the rep was so prompt and helpful with her response.

So when i am playing music from other room and i used some application on the phone for few minutes i have to go back to press the button again and again ,super annoying .Didnot expect that at all for a bluetooth speaker..Also my phone doesn't connect to it right away. I have to go back to setting>Bluetooth and press the speaker to connect it. For most of the Bluetooth speakers on market your phone picks up the signal right away  and Bluetooth on the speaker wakes up automatically..including my 12$ logitech speaker from best buy which i bought 2 years ago..

Bluetooth pairing is easy and I’ve never had an issue. The Bluetooth range is good. No issues. I’ve only paired it with my iPhone so take that for what it’s worth. Sound quality is nice for a speaker this small. The only issue I have is sometimes it’s just not loud enough. Other times, the volume is more than adequate. I don’t know why that is, but sometimes the volume from the speaker is mildly louder than what comes out of my iPhone. It doesn’t happen all the time, and I think it occurs mostly (maybe only) when I listen to podcasts thru the speaker.

"Let's compare the 2011 Bose Soundlink 1 vs. this 2017 Cambridge Soundworks Oontz Angle 3.  No surprise the Bose sound outperforms at all volume levels.  No contest, especially at volumes where twenty people are in the room.  Otherwise, the Oontz is similar or perhaps a bit easier to use than the Bose and half the size, charging on a simple USB port.  It plugs to a computer or a wall-plug converter.  Oontz provides credible clarity and depth of sound quality at low levels that begins to break up after mid-plus levels of volume.  Value for dollar, Oontz Angle 3 crushes the competition.  It’s not intended for maximum volume at parties or the greatest possible sound quality for yourself, but for a small object set atop the hard surface of a breakfast bar, it works well and sounds pretty awesome.

"I don't know how it gets much better than this little thing.  It has really nice bass to it for such a tiny unit. To give you an idea of the size, a standard sticky note would cover each end.  The design is nice too. The triangular shape makes it easy to place, and it has rubber feet that help it stay.  I've used it for a couple rounds of golf without recharging, so it's got pretty good battery-life too.  The recharge port is the standard micro USB that's common on most Android devices, so there's always a cable around to charge it.  The Bluetooth is seamless.  You can control the music from your phone or straight on the device.  At max volume, it produces 75-78 decibels.

It will obviously sacrifice SOME sound quality for being pretty small and relatively inexpensive, but for $30 I don't think you can really ask for much better.  A definite good buy and I plan on picking up a second and maybe a third.  My only complaint with the unit is that it comes with a laughably short charging cord.  Its a simple USB to microUSB cord and fortunately I had some longer spares kicking around so it's not a major issue, but it definitely gives the vibe of a corporate decision to shave pennies per unit off the bottom line.",4,1,2017-3-2,1,1,0

It is super easy to use, connects to bluetooth quickly, and the sound is amazing!! Seriously, I don't understand how such good sound can come out of a little thing like this. I am reordering another for myself. It will be perfect to bring outside in the summer, and is a great size to throw in a beach bag or purse. Great purchase!",5,1,2017-12-26,1,1,0
"I love the speaker! Unfortunately all of my belongings were destroyed by someone who drove over them while we were at the beach and I lost the speaker. I will definitely try to purchase again. Great sound for something this size, great for house parties or even to take to the beach or pool where you don’t want to blast your music to the surrounding people and disturb them.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
I was looking for a small speaker that I could take to work. Looking for a decent quality and decent battery. So far after having this for about a month it has blown my expectations out of the water. Amazing battery life and better than expected audio! Clear and good bass. Bluetooth is pretty good too. I work in a large warehouse setting and this connected from the next large aisle over. I’d say about 40 ft. Highly recommend!,5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"This speaker is impressive. It's small and portable, but still loud and (more importantly) has really good sound quality. The price is also very reasonable considering the quality and power of this little guy. Keep in mind that it fits in the palm of your hand. The battery life is really good too, it's never disappointed me.Later on I bought the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra which is a slightly larger and heavier version of this speaker. It's still reasonably small and light and can be taken anywhere, but it's less portable than this one. I recommend that one over this one if both fit your purpose, even though there's a $10 price difference. But both are really good speakers and high quality.",5,1,2018-2-17,1,0,0
"This makes a great addition to any technology you have. Don't have bluetooth stereo in your car? Charge this thing up and take it with you.  I carry it around the house & yard with me.  When it's connected to my Echo Spot, I tune in to some music and take this out in the yard or garage, wherever I'm working. Other times I connect my cell phone to it and can answer & disconnect calls, talk & listen, & adjust volume. It's awesome. Great sound and range!!",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"It sounds really good for such a small and inexpensive speaker, and easily makes the Bluetooth connection with my devices. The charger cord connection is one of those usb/mini-usb things like android phones have (mine just had the cord, no wall plug, so I use my phone's wall plug to charge it). It certainly won't rattle any windows, but it is loud enough to hear over the background noises in the control room at work. Battery life seems to be good, we'll see how that does after a few months of use. I'm quite pleased with this purchase so far.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",5,1,2016-6-12,1,0,0
"When my old speaker died I picked this one up based on the reviews. It sounds really good for a $20 speaker and has good volume. Unfortunately I noticed one glaring drawback in that it only plays mono audio and not stereo, despite having 2 speakers. This was really noticeable when the song 718 by 2 Skinnee J's came on.Aside from that, there is no button to skip a song, either forward or back it would be nice if there was an option. Pressing the + (plus sign) does not do it.",3,1,2018-11-15,1,0,0
"The battery cannot be easily recharged because the cord won’t stay inserted into the speaker. It keeps falling  out or —worse — it loosens but appears to still be connected. Meanwhile, it’s not charging. (A slowly pulsing red light Indicates it’s charging.)This is the second Oontz I’ve bought with this problem, so apparently it’s a flaw in design.",1,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
I jave now bought 2 of these speakers and same issue with each.  After 6-8 months they just don't bluetooth connect.  I don't understand why Amazon thinks this is a choice speaker.  it's certainly not my choice,1,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
So I leave this speaker plugged in all the time. I’m hoping that’s ok cause I’ll probably never move it from my end table. Sound is great. Much better than the first one I bought From a different manufacturer that only lasted a few months. Will revisit this review if it lasts a while cause so I like it. A lot of sound for such a small speaker!,4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"We have tried multiple ways to get this device to charge and have never been able to get it to connect to bluetooth either.  Not happy as we have not been able to return it either.

"I need a small bluetooth speaker for night time listening to my tv so I could hear without using headphones.  I bought this inexpensive Bluetooth speaker expecting poor sound and hope it worked as Bluetooth. Much to my surprise and well beyond any expectations, this speaker is great, outstanding, better than expected.  Hooked to IPhone and computer too, excellent product.  Thank you for a great product, buying two more today for my wife and son. Great deal.",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"I have owned Cambridge SoundWorks products before & loved them. This item is just as good. The separate volume control is fantastic. The speaker is very loud for its size, much louder than I expected. Very little distortion at medium high volume. It does breakup at Max volume, but everything has limits.I was definitely not disappointed.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,1,0
I was looking for something to use while I worked out or took a shower as my phone wasn't doing it for me and buds kept falling out.  For $25 I wasnt sure what I was going to get.  But it is perfect.  It pairs very quickly with my iphone and ipad.  It has a very good and crisp sound too.  More bass than I would have expected from something so small.  I would recommend.,5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Brought this as travelling replacement for my Soundfreaq (which I would recommend anytime for what it is), just because ofless size and weight - and couldn't be happier. Impressed by the clearness and strength of the sound, as well as the cleverly placed interface buttons - those on the ""triangular"" side of unit have very pleasant amount of pressing feedback...Pairing was a breeze. Oontz seems to be more responsive at reconnecting to the source (like after the source (tablet) comes up from sleep/suspend mode) than some other bluetooth speakers I tried.",5,1,2015-10-21,1,2,0
"This little speaker delivered exactly as I'd been told it would.  Obviously not the best base at this low price, but the sound output is worlds higher than you'd expect - definitely enough to play music for a large room, outdoor park area, etc.  Sound is going to slightly tinny w/ little base, but worlds better than a smart phone speaker...  Battery life is surprisingly good, too.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"I've used this indoor/outdoor for two weeks now. The battery is still going. It's mostly paired to my iPhone, but I tested it on the Apple TV too with great success. It pairs quickly. It's much smaller than I thought because there aren't any scale pictures. It's probably as long as an adult hand for reference. It doesn't sound as deep as a $250 unit, but if placed properly, can provide great range. I placed mine in an open wood box which provides much deeper bass resonance. Our main room is large and it fills the space well.",5,1,2017-9-5,1,1,0
Actually bought this for my car and it works great. Having an old car (2001) I have tried FM adapters and other speakers but was never happy. I pop this little speaker in my bag on trips and love the sound. I use it in my kitchen as well and the sound fits all sorts and sizes of spaces. Battery life is really good and goes a really long time between charges. This is my second Oontz speaker and the one I got a few years ago and that one is still going strong.,5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"I just received it so the jury is still out on the battery?  Bluetooth to an iPhone easy, sound is good for me but I’m not trying to blast or compete with others.  I bought this to replace another that the battery died.  It’s a different model and bigger then my last one however if you want longer battery time those tiny cute little ones won’t last nearly as long.  If the battery life expectancy isn’t what its suppose to be I will be back again.",5,1,2019-4-19,1,0,0
"This thing isn't that big, but man can it get room filling sound!  Paired very quickly to a variety of my devices, looks great, compact and neat design, but I can't get over how awesome this sounds!  Now, keep in mind it is still a small device, so don't expect bass like a 12"" subwoofer or stadium filling sound--but in your house or in a room, it is loud AND clear!  I also bought it on sale, so $19.99 total...definitely the best sounding anything I've bought for $20!  Definitely, definitely recommend!  Or buy as a gift...whoever you give it to will love it!",5,1,2018-9-29,1,0,1
"Have used these for over a month. It is necessary to use a cord connection - the bluetooth connection would not work (evidently there is a problem in getting a bluetooth connection with a Microsoft Windows system). Still, the corded connection worked well, and the volume (as promised) has been more than adequate, which was a problem with other small speaker systems. You can't really get a stereo effect with only this one speaker - they would be wise to market a 2-speaker set so that stereo sound would come through.",4,1,2017-9-27,1,1,0
"This is the best bluetooth speaker I have ever purchased. And it was a lot cheaper than some of the others.  This is paired with my pc so I can listen to the radio and music library all over my house and the sound is wonderful for both. This, of course, is not a base amplifier, but if you just want your music to sound good, you will be happy.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"These speakers work great and the bluetooth is a nice feature. They have a loud, clear sound. My only complaint is the bluetooth for some reason is not compatible with my iPhone's voicemail. We ordered this to use at my sister's memorial service, and several friends who lived out of town had left voicemails on my phone of memories of her, which we played at the service. The ones left through WhatsApp played fine with the bluetooth but the ones left as normal voicemails would not play, so we used the (included) cord to physically connect the phone to the speaker. Still for netflix, hulu, or streaming music (general use), these work great.",4,1,2016-11-16,1,1,0
"I ordered this product based on the reviews and also because I've heard of Cambridge SoundWorks products before. I remember their reputation as one of quality, so that with the reviews led me to purchase it. I have used it for two weeks now and I have have been very very satisfied! The product was shipped and arrived timely (as promised) and the sound from this little box is amazing! I bought it to use in my car I drive at work. It doesn't have a radio and I drive with my windows down so the speaker on my cell phone (where my music is) isn't loud enough to overcome the road noise. The Oontz Angle 3 takes care of the problem. It's loud! I mean loud, and I haven't turned it up all the way yet. I couldn't be happier with the sound. The design of the box is actually very useful. Without thinking of it, I have found the shape really lends to placing it on the dash of the car and it rides sturdy and the position is great for sending the sound into the cabin of the car. The rugged look and use of rubber makes it well suited for getting knocked around.As for the bluetooth, I haven't had a problem yet. Pairing was simple and quick and when I turn the unit on it quickly connects to my phone with an audible indicator that lets you know it's done. The auto disconnect and auto off features are welcome conveniences and they are perfectly programmed for typical everyday use. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it!",5,1,2016-9-14,1,1,0
"From the reviews I thought I was getting a good value. It's an Amazon Choice and the description says ""HIGHER QUALITY CRYSTAL CLEAR SOUND"".  That is so far from the truth on the unit I received.  The music is distorted and sounds over modulated even at low volume.  I even tried alternate output to the transmitter.  Wish I had bought a better speaker even at a higher price.  What good is a speaker with an annoying sound?",1,1,2018-12-2,1,1,0
"This thing is awesome. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She originally asked for a beats pill, but who has that kind of money, especially for a teen that will end up losing it or breaking it. So she didn’t like it, kind of like getting socks for Christmas. I found it still in the box in the living room beside the couch and figured I would use it. Curiosity got the best of me. I could really use something like this at work too. I synced it to my iPhone, and WOW! This is amazingly impressive. It’s loud with crystal clean sound. My daughter came in and heard me playing with it and proceeded to ask for it back. Now I can hear her playing her horrible music all the way across the house. I immediately regretted giving it back. I ended up buying one for myself and one for my wife",4,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0

I can not believe how big and deep and true the sound on this tiny speaker is. I have it on my desk and it's making the pens in the pen jar vibrate. Great with both big orchestral sound and a single pure voice.  I have no idea how they've been able to pull this off in this size and sell it for twenty bucks.

"Speaker is super. Connects easy, sound excellent and volume way beyond expected. More importantly, the customer service by Cambridge is excellent. True sign of a great company and product is not when things go right but when they go wrong. The speaker simply stopped working. Performed all the standard actions to get it working and could not. Contacted the company via their web site. Within less than a half hour received an email asking me to perform a few simple items to try and resolve the issue. When those issues could not be resolved, no questions asked arrangements were made to send to me a replacement speaker at nominal cost for shipping. Could not ask for anything more in the nature of customer service. Excellent.",5,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0
"I love this little speaker. I was worried I would regret not buying the newer version with a longer battery life and greater range. I'm sure that's a good product, too, but this little guy has proven to work perfectly for my needs. I like that it's smaller than the new version, too.The sound is fantastic for such a small speaker I have yet to hear any distortion, buzzing, or other off-putting sounds even at highest volumes. I saw some YouTube reviews which rated this speaker as having a better sound than the newer version in side by side comparisons, but I'm sure that's highly subjective. I suspect the speakers themselves are identical and only the form factor is changed.",5,1,2017-1-5,1,0,0

"Out of everything I’ve bought on Amazon, this is probably the best thing I’ve ever bought. This baby just broke on me today, and I bought it July 10, 2017. Today is August 25, 2020. I bought this the summer I graduated high school and this baby has lasted through several drinking parties, outdoor hangouts, and has even traveled with me to Mexico, California, Wisconsin Dells, etc. I take hot showers and I’m not sure if this should affect it, but water condensation hasn’t gotten in. This thing is really water-resistant. I have lots of sentimental moments with this speaker and its kind of corny to say but I wonder how the last three years would have been without this speaker. I think the reason this won’t work is because it won’t charge anymore. Battery is probably shot. But still 3 years is a while for a speaker!!! RIP MS OONTZ",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,1

Plugged it in to check it out anyway and WOW! Almost blew my eardrums out! It’s sound is super clear, LOUD and the size is perfect for me to stick in my suitcase for our upcoming trip to carribean!

"Absolutely the best little bluetooth speaker I've purchased.  Bought it about a month ago.  After the initial charge, I put it in my golf bag.  It has gone to the course with me no less than 5 times, and to the driving range once.  I played nine holes each time (about 2 hours) and had my music playing through the OontZ Angle.  Also listened to tunes at the driving range.  Total of about 11 non-consecutive playing hours over the course of a month.  I am just now planning on charging the speaker, despite it still showing half a charge on my phone's indicator!  The battery on this little speaker is beyond insane!  Plus, the sound is clear and full.  You really can't ask for anything more in a portable speaker.

"Fantastic! This sounds way better than it's price tag would imply. It looks good, feels good, and holds up great! I work in a restaurant and bought this to stick in the dish pit so the dishes would be a bit more fun. It's loud enough to be heard over the spraying water and clamor of dishes, and it doesn't lose the clarity. It's also affordable enough that I can just buy it for my coworkers without feeling like it's a huge commitment.

Since there is no other means by which to charge the internal battery, the device is now useless.It would seem to me in the interests of producing a reasonably durable item, you might consider, using a more durable USB charging port, develop wireless charging capabilities or go the other way and include a suitable DC adapter. The increase in cost wouldn't be more than 10% and I'd happily pay that much more for an item that I didn't have to replace in 3 months because of a faulty charging port.",3,1,2018-10-1,1,0,0
"It works perfectly! And the sound is amazing. (I'm not a hardcore audiophile like some who have reviewed this and found it wanting :) ) Thank you Cambridge Soundworks!That being said, such a speaker probably is not designed to ride hard on a bike - the speaker grille seems to have permanently avulsed after many vibrations and bumps and stuff. This happened maybe two months or so after I got it. I can still tuck it into a couple soft grooves around the main housing, but it won't stick in anymore.",5,1,2017-5-22,1,0,0

It has excellent reviews and i have always been a fan of Cambridge/Creative products - always good sound from very capable equipment.This thing didn't disappoint with multiple connectivity options and (for the money and size) fantastic sound.

I am doing a comparison with my mpow Bluetooth speaker as this is the only other I own and have experience with.First let me say this little guy packs a punch. It is a little bit smaller than my mpow. It is also noticeable louder than the mpow. I turned my mpow all the way up and then did the same for the oontz angle and it kept going. It also seems to have a little bit more bass sound to it. I also like the angle at which this speaker sits. It helps project the sound upwards. Which was probably part of the design.,5,1,2019-1-3,1,0,1
"The sound is reasonable on the Oontz Angle 3. It's comparable to just about every bluetooth speaker of its size. I've yet to hear one with any reasonable clarity and balance. In order to get a more balanced sound, I need to enable bass boost in the iPhone settings. That's about 3 menus deep and is something I don't want to do every time I'm using the device and when I'm done using the device. You won't get any decent clarity with this device.Pairing the Oontz Angle 3 was easy. I didn't get to test how long this device lasts on a single charge.",2,1,2016-6-12,1,1,0

So now instead of a speaker on my nightstand exactly 12 ft from my bluetooth pc, it has to sit half way at 6ft to work 70% of the time. I am not impressed by any means, I am infact thinking of returning it, period!",1,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
I would definitely recommend this speaker. The price is so reasonable for the quality you're receiving. It plays very loudly without much feedback or distortion. Quickly connects with bluetooth and charges fast as well. It's a nice sleek design as well. Very lightweight. Would definitely recommend if you're just looking for a good quality speaker that wont break the bank. It would be sufficient enough for a small party too.

"Definitely worth the money.  I'm one that often very wary about buying relatively inexpensive electronics but for about $20 why not give it a try.  I've been looking for a durable waterproof speaker for sometime now and this product seemed to come very highly rated and now I know why.  Sound quality the great, there is even quite a bit of bass coming from the little speaker.  The look is modern and sleek, often rivaling much more expensive products. Battery life is great! I've been using it on and off for about a month (a couple times playing it all day long) and I have yet to charge it. Pairing a device with the speaker is quick and easy via bluetooth. Waterproof capabilities have yet to be thoroughly tested- I've tried it in the shower a couple of times (works great!) but have not brought it to the pool or anywhere else besides indoors.

My first got it I wasn't impressed until I realized after using it Outdoors it is loud for a small as it is. Does not have a lot of bass. But for the money in size a great little speaker. Used it at the pool on a regular basis constantly got it wet and had no problems. Just bought the 3XL version what does have significantly more Bass. Very happy with both,5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I own 3 of the Oontz speakers; this particular model and those that have the ability to pair with one another. They are amazing. The sound quality, reliability, battery life and size rival much more expensive speakers. I have a Bose radio/CD player and I find the sound quality of the Oontz speakers unbelievably equal. Simply - the Oontz speakers are fabulous.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"This is a very nice little, very lightweight, speaker and a tremendous value..  Being from Cambridge Soundworks, I had every confidence at ordering time that it would not disappoint... and it didn't.  There are certainly more powerful and ""bassier"" units availale ut they cost MUCH more.  most other portable BT speakers in this price range are junk.  They have poor sound and miserable battery life.  Not this Oontz Angle3.  It has a nice full sound that is perfect for social gatherings where you want some ambient music but you're not creating a disco or rock concert  The sound is full enough even at lower volumes to be perfect in the kitchen or bedroom too.  I ought this for my daughter for her birthday.  My fiance was so impressed she ordered one for herself that very night  That kinda says it all right there, doesn't it?  Get one.. you won't be disappointed..",5,1,2016-5-18,1,0,0
"These are one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon! I have bought 2 myself and are getting ready to order a couple for family members at Christmas! Small, compact, packs a punch, can be used with dual audio on most devices, and the batteries last forever!

"Waterproof, loud, but unfortunately not the best sound. The other types of Oontz speakers sound great. This one, probably because of the waterproofing, is not a crisp, clear sounding example. It’s ok, but not good enough.I returned it and bought the Plus which sounds great!  I’ll just have to be careful not to drown it.",2,1,2019-7-22,1,1,0

I contacted Cambridge Soundworks and they were extremely prompt and apologetic and first offered me some troubleshooting help and told me to let them know if this worked. It didn't so I emailed them back and again, very quick response within a day or so. They then offered to send me a replacement speaker along with a carrying case for my troubles. It arrived two days later. The replacement speaker is working fine.- The sound is nice and clear. I would like more bass but from a speaker this size, I am pleased.",5,1,2016-1-10,1,0,0
"I have natural, 4B hair and I don't straighten it too often. I decided to give this a try so I could not only get it dry but also a bit more manageable before I used a flat iron.

"This is a very good speaker for the price. It gets pretty loud. I use this at my work almost everyday and I work on a very loud warehouse. It will last for my whole shift, while i blast it at almost full volume, which is around 6 to 6.5 hours. It's connected with everything I have needed to connect with as well, including a crappy little mp3 player I had to get because I cannot bring my phone into work.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
Way better sounding than I expected for the price. We use it for outdoor movies and it’s amazing!  Only downfall is you can either use it plugged in or via Bluetooth not both at the same time.

I wanted something to stream Amazon music from Alexa to my home gym and occasionally out to our patio.  It needed to have enough power to hear over top of my treadmill but good sound quality.  (I'm kinda an audiophile :) )This little unit is perfect.  It's small and light enough you could tote it around easily.  It pushes out plenty of power and the sound for such a small unit is surprisingly good.  I have it powered most of the time so I can't speak to the battery life.,5,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
"It worked when I got it but would sometimes randomly disconnect.  But after one month, it wouldn't charge, connect and eventually work under power.

"I have been pleasantly surprised by this speaker. I have a solid sound system for my more extravagant listening pleasure but I needed something for when I clean the apartment late at night, take a shower, go on a picnic, etc. I saw this and just had to try it for the price and let me tell you that it is worth it.  I use it when I clean the kitchen, take showers, relax in bed and much more. The battery life on it is great in my opinion. Sound quality is actually surprisingly good. Connecting from device to device has been pleasant. I use it with my iOS devices and my Mac. I attempted to use my laptop with Ubuntu Linux installed and that gave me a bit of trouble but I chalk that up to my ignorance of the penguin. I didn't know what to expect with the price point being what it was. I definitely recommend this speaker to anyone who wants a solid portable speaker but doesn't want the the price tag of the name brands.",5,1,2015-11-23,1,1,0
"This is one of many speakers I've bought throughout the past 3 years trying to find a small, portable tough speaker. I use this speaker all the time! like when I'm in the shower, working outside, or at parties. I first noticed that the speaker says it is water resistant and I have indeed tested that out by splashing water on it by running it under the sink. I could not notice any difference in controls or sound, it was just like I took it right out of the box, which I must add, it sounds far superior to any speaker, Bluetooth or not. I have absolutely no complaints about the sound at all, even from across my house which is about 20- 30 feet away. The sound for its size is just amazing! It is about the length of my hand and is louder than speakers that are three times bigger at four times the cost. The only complaint I have which is why I gave it a four out of five stars, is because the bass is so loud and insane, it makes the speaker rock at high volumes. This does give the illusion for a deeper base, but people might not like that because things on your table will start to shake and I can understand why people would get annoyed by that. So know if you do play it at high volumes, it will distort the sound a little bit and it will rock back and fourth. But i can tell you, from experience, that this little, rubberized, plastic budget speaker is actually very good! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is willing to spend less than $50 dollars on a bluetooth speaker.",4,1,2016-10-19,1,1,0
"I was very surprised with this lil speaker. As small as it is, it can really go very loud and what's even more amazing is the battery life! Been running it for few hours each day for 3 days now and I haven't had to charge it just yet! Also, the bluetooth connection is really strong. I left the speaker in a closed bedroom on the 3rd floor of our house and went to the 1st floor and it's still connected. I'm going to gift it to my sister and this is one of my best buys.",5,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
"The sound quality is surprising good for its size. Currently use it on my television with an external bluetooth transceiver I bought to stream audio from the led television - which doesn't have bluetooth - to this speaker. Sound quality is a noticeable improvement over the television's built in speakers. Will eventually purchase larger external bluetooth speaker for the television, but for now, this speaker is just fine.Final note. The speaker is aesthetically pleasing, and has the good solid soft rubber. I think the quality is as good as you can get for price and size.",5,1,2018-5-4,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker because it said it had a 100 foot wireless range - no, no it does not! If I carry it to my kitchen (approximately 40 feet from the music source) it starts cutting out - a lot! It is useless if it only works sitting in the same room as the music source. This one is probably going back!",1,1,2019-5-2,1,1,0
"I had previously given this product a 3 star rating due to the unit I received being defective. The unit would cut out constantly and made it impossible to enjoy what I was listening to. After writing my review, I was contacted by The OontZ Support Team the same day and they took care of the issue with friendliness and professionalism.Now that I have a perfectly working Angle 3, I can say that it is a fantastic product. It has amazing sound and volume considering how compact it is. Even at high volume I find the sound to be very clear. This speaker can't defy physics (it doesn't have the size to move the amount of air required for super deep bass), but it does a great job of reproducing sound within its frequency range.",5,1,2017-7-26,1,1,0
Had it for 3 months and then all the sudden it won't turn on. Seems like a faulty power switch because the battery reads at 4v which is more than enough to power an led. Return window was only like 30-days. Not happy and don't recommend.,1,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
"I use this speaker at home, in my car (the radio no longer works), in my classroom at school, everywhere! I've never gone up to full volume and I like listening pretty loudly! The sound is clear and never fuzzy, it connects well with both my phone and iPad, and I often place it on a shower shelf and it's never complained about the water. I've had it for about 7 months or so and it's just as perfect as when I first got it. It's super portable as well!",5,1,2019-5-4,1,0,0

"Love love love this little dynamo!  Big things do come in small packages.  Despite it's size, there is nothing small about the sound this funny-looking little device cranks out!  I use in the bathroom to play music while I'm in the shower.  I take it on the patio, down to the beach and have even found a way to strap it to my motorcycle and enjoy tunes while I'm out cruising.  Trust me, you won't find a better value for the money right here.  Between my son and I, we've looked at, tried, demoed most BT speakers under $100 and this stands out amongst the crowd.  Let's face it, there are tons of options in this category and it can be overwhelming to know what is worth your hard earned money and what is basically just total crap.  Do yourself a favor, get this little puppy, enjoy your music and move on to other more important matters in your life - this thing can provide the soundtrack while you're doing it!",5,1,2016-10-24,1,0,0
"Made a simple solution for sound on my bedroom TV, the 10 cent speakers were not cutting it, but this made a great and simple solution for better sound when paired to my FireTV, manually have to set volume, but worth it, daughter and wife love connecting it to their phones and listening to stories or music, so overall a great value.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"Very impressed so far. Has clear sound even at high volume. With speaker outside of building, picked up signal from phone at about 80-100 feet away. (Uninstructed). Flip side to distance, phone went inside workshop (speaker outside) and had a sketchy signal because of electrical interference. Not, enough to lower star rating. The only thing I would add to the speaker, might be a strap handle to make it easier to snatch and go. Although purchasing a carrying case is an option. I will definitely order this one again.Update... 11-25-2018. Ordered another one. Mine literally floated out of my greenhouse during hurricane Florence flood. Never to be seen again. Ordered another for my son too. His flooded in his shed and worked for 2 months before giving up. We both loved these speakers! Distance and sound quality have been awesome. Battery life was insane.

"I've had this device for a couple of months now sitting on my desk at work. The sound is decent for the price point and it's compact and looks nice on the desk but, over the last two/three weeks, it's bluetooth connectivity has been spotty.  Sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't.  There are no other devices paired to this device.  Only my laptop.  There's two ""speakers"" that you can choose from in Windows - the Headset (hands-free) and the Headphones (stereo).  Sometimes it connects to the Headset Hands-Free, sometimes to the Headphones Stereo, sometimes not at all.  You can switch between them and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  In almost all cases now as well, the volume comes on at full blast and I have to scramble to turn the volume down regardless of any Windows volume settings or settings on the Oontz device itself.  Half the time I can't control the volume with the Windows volume controls and/or keyboard buttons either.  It's very frustrating especially when it worked pretty much as expected for the first month.  This device has gotten a lot of good reviews so maybe mine is the outlier.  Giving it two stars since it does work just frustrating dealing with connectivity and volume issues.",2,1,2019-5-29,1,0,1
"I bought this in January 2016, used it infrequently (charging it a maximum of 10 times in 12 months) and it's recently stopped taking a charge - it's now dead as a doornail.  Since it died last week, no lights, no charge, with the same charger I've used all along, etc.  It's clearly an electrical issue, perhaps a charger port or battery issue, but it's disappointing that something I liked and used carefully is now something I have to recycle.  When it worked - a solid 4 stars.  I got a year out of the Oontz, but I have another round X-Mini corded, rechargeable speaker that I've had for about 9 years that's still going strong.

I don't leave reviews. Period. I have bought hundreds of items from amazon ( Mostly books) and this is my first review. I. Love. This. I am a little hard of hearing and In my bedroom I have a Mini AC unit and a humidifier going and it has quite a bit of white noise. It's enough that I can't hear my Ipad mini (my only source of entertainment in my room?.  I listen to audiobook's or youtube at least 2 hours a day every and I have used headphones for 5 years in my room to hear. Let me tell you carrying around an Ipad mini with headphones attached when you are trying to clean is awful. I finally had it when I clotheslined myself and broke a headphone set. This has been amazing. I can hear everything clearly from across any room in my house and I don't have to carry my everywhere. It connects to my Ipad immediately when I turn it on super easy. Would recommend to everyone.,5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0

I ended up buying JBL wireless speakers later on as well but still would pull this one out and listen to it just as often as the JBL speakers which i paid twice as much for.  A couple of days ago i had it in the car and i kept hearing a beeping sound and later that day i notice i was getting a notification on my phone the speaker had less than 10% battery life, i tried charging it several times and got the same message.  So it appears the battery life of the unit is about 3 1/2 years.  So at a cost of $7.99 per year for the price i paid for it i say it was well worth it.  I now thinking about buying the Ultra or plus. What made be buy it was the thousands of reviews for the product.",4,1,2016-1-11,1,1,0

Update: 6 months dead. Won’t do a thing. I did brag about how much I loved them so I bought 4 and had friends buy them. I also bout two of the newer versions one also just died the same week. Only had that one over 2 months. And I bought one last week for someone. Was sold but I think I will stop buyingI think for the price point it’s fantastic. So I bought 3 more.

It's extremely small and portable but the sound quality is really surprisingly good and it has decent separation, bass, treble and so forth and not much distortion.

Excellent bass and treble, without the ""tinny-ness"" you get from a lot of others.  Pairing with my iPhone was quick and easy and has pretty good range from phone to speaker.

All you do it press the power button again and it will automatically reconnect with the most recent device. Battery life is pretty substantial as well. I use it on and off through the school day and it lasts a few days. It will also play while charging which is an added bonus! Its super portable and compact.

After some bad luck with bluetooth speaker I wasnt sure is we should have bought another low end bluetooth speaker. My wife ended up ordering one of these for herself after reading all of the reviews. After one week of every day usage I have to say I am impressed. We bought these for $25 and they are worth every penny. They connect very easily. Good battery life. Light weight. Great sound. They are louder than my laptop speaker.If they hold up by the end of the month I will buy myself one.,5,1,2017-10-3,1,1,0
"If you want  a very portable bluetooth speaker, this one is doable. Connectivity is quick and offers a feedback tone when connecting or disconnecting. If turned on, and isn't paired, it turns off with an audible tone after several minutes. Those are handy features for most people. The sound? There are no real highs and of course no lows. To reproduce low frequencies it requires amperage. That being said, this little speaker has good clarity and delivers acceptable sound in a small room. Placement will determine the balance of sound produced within reason. Putting it in a corner will produce the fullest sound. The OontZ was bought for my wife to use in the kitchen instead of her phone speaker. I probably enjoy not hearing her phone play music more than she does.Bottom line is this is portable, intelligible, and an excellent alternative to listening to a phones speaker.",3,1,2016-1-9,1,0,0

Also its charge would drop after 25min regardless of the playing volume (which was quite low at best).Audio quality is subjective so others may find this to be adequate.

"Am using this OontZ Angle 3 with my iPhone 6s via the AUX port on the Angle 3 speaker to the headphone port on my iPhone when talking on the phone. Sound is much louder and clearer for my ears than by just using the speaker on the iPhone. The 3.5mm cord included in the box was too short, so I switched to a 3' KabelDirekt 3.5mm Aux to Aux Cable available on Amazon.The cons on the Angle 3 are a) it's difficult to use/find the buttons in the dark, b) using the aux connector gives you much louder volume than by using its Bluetooth and c) Bluetooth distance is short.",4,1,2018-1-26,1,0,0
I am a pastor so I use the speaker for some of the songs I use in sermons.  Works great!  The whole congregation can hear it. I also use it for songs I use at funerals.  Even outdoors the sound is powerful.  I love this product and you will too.,5,1,2019-8-21,1,1,0
"I liked the first one I purchased so much I bought another one. One always is in my car just in case a speaker is needed for things like Pandora. I am impressed with the great stereo sound it puts out. Its made from high quality material, looks really good, and an ideal size and easily portable. It connects to every Bluetooth device effortlessly and quickly and auto connects with no issues when its pairing device its turned on. I use with my Android phone as well as my company iPhone, my tablet and my desktop pc.",5,1,2017-8-6,1,1,0
"I got this about 2 months ago. The sound quality was definitely better than my phone or tablet, but it was never really awesome or anything. Still worth the money. Until today, anyways. I only use this a couple of times a week, and only for an hour or two, so definitely didn't abuse it. It just quit working. It will turn on but no matter how many devices I hook it to, it will not pay any sound, with the Bluetooth nor the auxiliary cord. Definitely not worth it.***EDIT***",5,1,2017-4-30,1,1,0
Ordered on the 7/17/2020 for my work truck which doesn't have a radio. The speaker sound is ok not the best but not horrible and doesn't get very loud. The Bluetooth requires you to manually go into the settings to connect it. I can deal with the sound and the Bluetooth but I cant deal with the charging/battery life. Charging never ends it can literally charge  5min to 5 hours to 5 days and the battery will still die in minutes. I only have one charging spot in my truck to run my CB off and charge my phone and the speak in between trips.,1,1,2020-8-11,1,0,1
"I have purchased two of these, specifically to use with an Echo Dot since these speakers don't automatically turn off after a period of inactivity.  One has worked great and sounded fantastic from the time it came out of the box.  The second was ordered four months later and has been spotty, frequently losing connectivity the entire time we've had it.  I eventually isolated the connectivity issue to the Bluetooth connection at the speaker and emailed customer service.  Despite some negative comments in the questions thread, customer service was fantastic.  They replied in less than 24 hours and offered me options to provide warranty service on the unit.  While I think this speaker provides good sound at a great value, I'll leave this review at 4 stars for now due to the quality control that allowed the faulty unit to get to me, but I may revise it when the new unit arrives, which is scheduled to happen tomorrow, less than a week after my initial contact with customer service.",4,1,2018-1-25,1,1,0
"4/2019 Update...This things was great until it just quit working. Seemed like it quit taking a charge because the red light blinked until it died, even plugged into the power outlet. Wouldn’t charge, I used a different cable, tested my cables. Definitely something wrong with this speaker. It’s been less than a year that I’ve had it. Pretty wasteful!So much smaller than I pictured but a lot louder than I imagined! Love it, going to buy my mom one for her garden. I stream spotify through it on the PC. The sound on my TV isn't great so I have my firestick connect to it too.",2,1,2018-1-14,1,0,0

"I bought this speaker in April for my husband to use in his vehicle for work.  I specifically bought this product because of all the other reviews and the description that boasts about the product's durability.  My husband loved it at first.  He used it daily and loved the sound quality despite his work vehicle being very loud.  It had a decent battery life.Unfortunately, by July the charging port no longer functions.  The 30 day return policy has already expired so I can no longer return this item.  This is greatly disappointing as my husband was enjoying this product not only for work but during the weekend at all of the summer barbecues we've been attending.  I really wish the return policy was 90 days.  I would have considered returning this for a replacement and giving it another chance.",2,1,2016-7-30,1,1,0
"Bought those for my girlfriend so that she's stop using her phone speaker while taking a shower. She REALLY liked it. The volume is phenomenon, plenty loud enough to be heard over the shower with plenty more to spare. The bass is very good as well, some songs with a lot of bass will cause it to rattle on the desk or counter, just be careful because I've had it rattle off the desk on me once or twice before. Not that it mattered, it didn't hurt at any at all, still works amazing after a drop or 2. Haven't drenched it under water so I can't saying about that but it been in the shower and no difference. I do wish that it had Multi-point Bluetooth so that I could have both my work and personal phone connected at the same time, but that's no deal breaker. Much cheaper than the Beats and other name brand comparable speakers, but all the same power. Love it. HIGHLY recommended. Pick one up, you won't regret it.",5,1,2015-12-12,1,0,0

"well i could not connect it with my crap chromebook- so i connected it to my tablet. Then the OontZ  was fine.

Now my tablet says it is paired with OONZ but that there are no bluetooths nearby. I forgot to add that if you have a piece of crap chromebook which my last speaker did not connect to either- this speaker is Great plugged into it. Way better than listening through chromebook. It may be my acer c720p though. It has a lot of issues even though it indicates it has bluetooth.

We bought this one to replace the speaker that my father-in-law finally wore out after several years. At the time of purchase we bought two for ourselves and one for my father-in-law.

I purchased this for a better/louder sound connection during a video call. The major problem is the Bluetooth lag in the sound is about 1 to 1.5 seconds out. So the mouth of the person speaking is not in sync with the sound! it works okay otherwise. I understand there are two components to a Bluetooth transmission. I think the speaker is at fault.,1,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"I use this speaker to listen to audiobooks while driving in my older, noisy truck. This speaker has a better bass than the Amazon portable Bluetooth speaker, and it is much easier to hear the reader's voice than the other one. The rubber water-resistant ""gaskets"" on each end and the rubber feet help hold the device securely on my dashboard against the windshield. When I angle the speaker slightly toward me, I get a slightly louder volume against the windshield. It does not slide on the dashboard, but a dashboard mat helps with that. The blue and red LED lights are bright enough to see in strong daylight.The rubber covering that helps secure the USB port from moisture is somewhat difficult to lift. I must pick at it for several moments before it lifts. A longer tab on this covering would make it easier to raise. The speaker is a deep black and can be hard to see in my carrying bag. I am almost always driving when I handle the Oontz, and it is hard to determine the front from the back with a quick glance. I must turn it over several times to make sure the front, with the small speaker holes, is facing forward. I rate it 5 stars because the sound quality is excellent for the price and size. The negative qualities result from my personal use experience, because I am always moving when I'm handling it. If I could sit still, I would have no issues.",5,1,2018-6-3,1,0,0
Received one that was broke or defective. The USB charging cable that came with it would not go into the charging port on the speaker. I know there was no problem with the cable because it worked fine in my other Oontz speaker I own. This was going to be a gift for my son because he kept borrowing mine to take to work. He had previously used 3 different speakers and said my Oontz rocked&was the best. So now I'm waiting for it to go on a lightening sale again.,1,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I love this speaker! I bought the DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker with HD Sound and Bass back in March 2017 because I needed a little speaker for my TV in my bedroom. A soundbar is just too big for the space. The sound is awesome and it's a great speaker but I hated that I had to press and hold down the power button in order to turn it off and on every single time. I also had to swirl the circle so many times in order for it to be max volume every single time. Quite annoying. So! I ordered the Oontz Angle 3 and I can't say enough about it. It's amazing and the sound is very good. I climb into bed, press the power button one time. No holding it down and watch my shows. The first night I got it, I turned it on, turned the volume all the way up because I can adjust the volume through my TV, put my shows on and fell asleep. When I woke up I noticed the speaker was off. Did it die? Nope! It automatically shuts off a few minutes after my tv shuts off! Awesome feature in my book! The next night I turned on my TV, turned on my Oontz speaker and guess what? The volume stays on the max volume setting I had put it on the night before! And last but not least, the battery! The battery seems like it lasts forever! I watch my TV nightly and it has been 2 weeks. I still haven't had to charge it. Simply amazing little speaker and I highly recommend!",5,1,2018-9-1,1,0,0
I got this speaker to bring on a boat trip recently. I easily connected it to my iPod.  We would leave the iPod in the cabin and just bring the speaker to the aft deck at the end of the day when relaxing.  We were gone about a month and I never had to charge it. Everyone was thrilled I had it along. Great value for the money.  I wish the base was a bit deeper but I can't complain given it's size and price.,4,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"Two things kept this from getting five stars, that is the range and the power/battery life. I keep the speaker in the bathroom and stream music from my Android phone. If I walk out of the bathroom with the phone then the music begins to get a bit choppy after about 10-12 feet, not too bad but I notice it. The speaker doesn't seem to hold charge that long or charge very fast while you are using it. If the speaker powers off (which it does after several minutes of not being used), then you have to power it back on by physically pushing the button on the speaker and sometimes resync. I wish I could walk into my house, hit the bluetooth button on my phone and immediately have the music stream over to the speaker, but it doesn't do that.It is a four star speaker because the price is great, I have dropped it once and it didn't break and it is really loud! =)",4,1,2016-1-6,1,0,0

"I've had this for a a few weeks, using it often for a construction jobsite. I have no complaints whatsoever thus far. I have abused it somewhat, dropping it accidentally from about 4 feet and using it in a light rain. It has impressive sound and volume for its size - and as a musician I'm pretty picky about speaker quality. I haven't drained the battery completely while listening to it, which apparently takes longer than 8 hours of continuous music.Update: After a few months of heavy use the speaker quit taking a charge. Since it was far past Amazon' return period I emailed the manufacturer and asked if they could help me. They were extremely helpful, and sent a replacement speaker - no questions asked - before they even had the defective one, plus they sent a neoprene case for it! Could not be happier with the speaker, especially now that I see the company truly stands behind their product! Would highly recommend!",5,1,2015-11-23,1,0,0
I like this speaker.  It is easy to connect but I wish it had a dedicated power plug and not just a USB power source.  The USB cord is maybe 7 inches long so not a lot of room if you want it connected while using it.  The beauty is that you can charge it and move it anywhere but the charge only lasts about 7 hours for me.  I would recommend it based on the price and features.  It sounds decent but not a lot of bass.  I use this for my office.,4,1,2017-4-25,1,2,0

Rubber on the ends is very useful. Easy to keep clean. I can stand it up, or lay it flat. It's really stable either way. Great quality product.I went into several big box stores looking at speakers but didn't find anything as good as this speaker for anywhere near the price. Most of the speakers there are too big.

This speaker is water resistant and sand resistant. I primarily got this because our family goes to the beach a lot and we tend to be kind of rough on our portable devices. This speaker sounds great and we don't have to worry about it getting sand inside it or water. We have exposed it to both but nothing has got inside and the sound quality is still excellent.

Bought two of these for Christmas presents.  The one my wife uses still works great.  She uses it on a daily basis.  My daughters however does not work properly anymore.  Does not charge well and bluetooth is spotty.  Be very careful of the charging port.  You do not want to put ANY strain on this while charging.  It must be gently removed or the port will break.

The small speaker is obviously only good in small spaces (like the shower), so I wanted something that was in between - Bluetooth with good sound, but not big or too small. Also, I didn't want to shell out $120-130+ for a Bose SoundLink at this time.I needed something to take to the beach and this little thing is IMPRESSIVE.

It has two front firing probably 2"" speakers, and on the bottom is a large oval ""subwoofer"" that basically runs the length of the cabinet.  I have two teenage sons, and between us all, we have probably owned 10 different bluetooth speakers under $50.  This is the best of them all, it is followed closely by the SoundBot SB520.

"I bought this a year ago and used it only a few times, but now it has no Bluetooth connectivity at all. No matter what I try to pair it with I get the message “make sure Oontz Angle is turned on and within range.”  I’m buying a different brand this time. Very disappointed.",1,1,2019-5-13,1,1,0
"I was needing a small bluetooth speaker to check out a problem with my desk top sound etc. This was the go to for the price. Wow ! I can say it isn't a Bose, but at $20 ? It's awesome. Now I'm  running my tunes of my S9 phone and the sound is good, it's small, easy to connect and isn't a pain in the butt to use.  Like I said - size, sound, easy to connect, practical to use ----? All better than I expected, especially at this price point. Who ever did this -- a big atta boy ( or girl ) for you. Thanks.",5,1,2018-8-18,1,0,0
"The unit paired with my Apple devices right away which was a definite plus. It played music with a surprisingly strong bass sound for a unit so small and it did justice to the rising and falling sounds of a movie played over it. All this was last night. Today, there is a static that is washing over the clarity of the sounds the speaker played so clearly a short twenty-four hours ago. Im wondering if this was just an older model-- the outside of its packageing was covered in dust-- and a replacement might do me better or if I should just ask for a refund.",2,1,2017-7-26,1,1,0
"I had the Angle 2 which I thought was much better. This one got stuck in Pairing mode and I could not get it out or get it to pair with a device. It would not turn off with the power button,noting. I literally had to let the battery die which took about 3 days!After I recharged it i figured lets give it a try again. I was able to pair it without an issue. It has been fine since (about 3 months) If it does it again it will lose stars.",4,1,2016-3-18,1,0,0

My boyfriend is very hard to get gifts for. When I heard him say a few times that he wishes he had a Bluetooth player I knew I needed to get to work. I looked at about everything from the over priced to the just right and all seemed to have mixed reviews so I wound up settling with the oontZ angle 3 and crossing my fingers. Boy was I impressed! He loved it and I was truly shocked with the quality. It works both Bluetooth and with the audio cable that was included in the box. Surprisingly it was REALLY LOUD! So loud that I had to keep telling him to turn it down like he was a 16 year old boy again only to find out that it was not even up all the way! It carried AMAZING sound quality and the sub puts out the perfect amount of bass. He loved that he can take phone call through the OontZ Angle 3 too! Seriously if you are looking for one this is IT! THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING PRODUCT!,5,1,2015-12-29,1,0,0
"This is the fourth Bluetooth speaker I've tried and it seems to have resolved the issues I had with the others. It paired instantly. The sound is excellent, especially for its size. The size is great too, small enough to easily take anywhere. It claims to be splash-proof so I'm comfortable using it on the boat. The battery outlasts any uses I've put it to and I charge it each time anyway. Oh, it's a great price too.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"This is a great speaker! The sound is full and loud. It works as a Bluetooth and a 3.5mm plug-in speaker. The speaker came fully charged. It has a cord to plug in if you don't want to use Bluetooth and a charging USB cable. Has a power on/off button, volume controls and pause button. I use it with my Fire 10 tablet to enhance the sound when I watch MLB At Bat baseball games. The sound, for some reason, isn't very loud for baseball games. But with this speaker it is perfect. This is a great buy. I'm very happy.",5,1,2018-7-22,1,0,0
"This easily connects and allows me to listen to any of my devices quickly and easily. The sound helps my laptop to be heard clearly when I am presenting, and it's loud enough to listen to podcasts in another room. I'm very pleased with its compact size. The only thing that would improve it would be to make the power and volume buttons easier to see. (They blend in beautifully, but that makes them harder to find.)",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"Great little speaker. It seems to hold a charge for 4-hours of play time on the first few charges, but that will depend on volume. I have used it in the garage for working out and while it isn't quite enough to run on a treadmill at high speed, it is plenty for filling up a large garage for lifting weights. Overall, great value. I've had the larger speaker for 3+ years and haven't noticed the battery life or sound quality decrease. I am hopeful this unit is built with the same quality.",5,1,2018-10-1,1,0,0
"I’ve been using this little guy to play music in my car (the radio gets old quick). The sound quality Bluetooth connectivity is awesome and the battery life is blowing my mind... I’ve charged it once since I got it 3-4 weeks ago, I use it daily, and it’s still nowhere near needing another charge.For anyone else looking to use it in the car, it’s got little rubber grips on the bottom that do an amazing job holding it in place!

"Sounds amazing, love the speaker. Bought 2 more for family members. Great sound for its very compact size. Durability is excellent with rubbarized corners if it happens to drop it wont just break unless the drop is reallly reallly bad. Bluetooth connection and buttons are easy to use, and easy to unpair for connect to new device. Battery life and charging speed is very reasonable. Stands the test of time and still sounds amazing! Good product, thanks!",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
In one word .... Amazing. Such incredible sound from this small devise is remarkable. I cannot praise this product enough. I am hard of hearing. I miss 50% of the dialog while watching TV. I am deaf to mid-range tones. With the OontZ Angle 3 connected to my Bluetooth devise (iPad-Air) I miraculously can hear clearly all the dialog. The dialog is as clear to me as wearing headphones. And the bass it produces is unbelievable. I only wish I had more Bluetooth devises to utilize this gem.,5,1,2017-9-21,1,1,0
"I bought this speaker (and a matching case) as a present for my son.  It is cute and compact, but has a huge robust sound to it. Fortunate, since I purchased the speaker online at Amazon, yet didn't get a chance to test the sound before it went under the tree. We were quite impressed with the bass and particularly, the loud volume. This is a great little mobile speaker. It is quite durable too, as my son takes it everywhere with him - even in the bathroom to blast his fav tunes while getting ready in the morning.  I recommend this speaker.",5,1,2018-4-23,1,0,0
"One of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon.When it arrived I was a bit surprised at its size. It was the dimensions as described but it just looked too small. However, it certainly does not perform small.",5,1,2017-7-11,1,2,0
"Love this little speaker!!! It's small, but powerful! Perfectly portable, and the battery seems to last forever! I don't usually play it at full volume, but even when I do, it seems like I can go weeks before having to charge it. I wish it had a skip forward, skip backward button, but to me it's not a big deal. I love the sound and the volume you can get out of it!! It's gotten wet a number of times and still works perfectly! We already recommended it to someone and they got one, too.",5,1,2017-3-2,1,2,0
"I bought this item because my JBL Xtreme keeps shutting down and JBL never really provided a solution fix to it, even online there's really no proper solution. So I checked the reviews of this portable on different sites and decided to try it. Well, inside my car it doesn't sound as good when i tried playing it outdoors. Especially the bass, maybe i just got spoiled with the Xtreme, but hey this portable BT speaker is a bang for your buck, maybe its more reliable than the current JBL speakers. I find it fascinating that in enclosed spaces it doesnt sound as good as when it's playing in open air spaces which to me is pretty confusing. But all in all, the battery life is superb, and the volume of this one is pretty good, my only gripe is with the bass capabilities of this speaker.",3,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0

"I've been using the OontZ for about 3 weeks and am very happy with the sound and bass response. I found that I have to adjust the equalizer settings a bit otherwise the treble was just a bit too high, but the sound is very clear. The bass is very good compared to my expectations, but not quite as good compared to the Bose portable speaker that I have heard from in store displays. Like I said, the bass is good, but sounds substantially better when you set it on a table or surface that slightly reverberates due to the fact that the bass radiator is on the bottom of the Angle. It has really nice rubberized feet that prevent any unwanted vibrations. The volume goes amazingly loud and still maintains great audio quality. Great battery life so far. Easily 8+ hours of playback. No trouble at all with Bluetooth functionality. I travel for work and I take it with all the time now. Packs very easily. Well worth the money for this great sound.",5,1,2016-1-13,1,0,0
"Excellent sound, good quality, it pairs very easily with both my phone and laptop, has a cable so you can use it too with it. The battery lasts a lot, I would say at least 5 hours of Youtube listening before charging it again. I even use it in the bathroom, and has not been affected by the moisture, works fine after two years. This product is a winner.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
I decided to upgrade my bluetooth speaker but I didn't want to pay too much since I don't listen to music aloud very often. This speaker was perfect for my needs. I love how easy it was to set up and use. The sound quality is great and the battery life was surprisingly long. I found myself charging it a lot at first but one day I decided to let it play for a few hours. I was so surprised that the long play barely put a dent in the battery life. I will be purchasing another as a gift.,5,1,2018-10-11,1,0,0
"I've tried a few of these blue tooth speakers and I ordered these for myself because of the price and the fact that they are water resistant.My first reaction to opening the package was that this was smaller than I expected.  It's the same general size as my Iphone 6.  And then I turned it on...  How does something so small produce so much sound?  I cranked it up playing several types of music through it (from Classical to Metallica) and no hesitation, no crackling, just massive sound coming out of something that is so portable.  I can throw this in my cars console and have plenty of room left over.",5,1,2015-11-9,1,0,0
"Great speaker but I wish it was louder.  Charge lasts at least 4-6 hours of continuous play, durable and has been used on a daily basis for almost a year.  Its compact enough that I now use it for work during presentations.  No problem connecting with devices, playing while charging or being dropped.  Still works as well as the first day, sound is clear, range is good.  If and when this dies I'll get the bigger version.",5,1,2018-3-7,1,1,0
"I purchased this for my desk at work, as we can't get any radio stations in the building.  I myself am tone deaf, but come from a family of people heavily into music.  This speaker made me realize how good my other speakers are in the house.  It doesn't have the greatest sound, but for the price it is very reasonable.  I keep it plugged in to my work PC all day so holding a charge isn't a problem. It does what I need it to do for a reasonable price and the sound is ok.  I have a UB Boom2 for home and its sound is much richer, but the price is higher.  I certainly don't want something worth stealing at the office, so this is perfect.",3,1,2016-7-31,1,1,0
"For the money, this speaker is a great deal. Very compact, yet delivers pretty darn good sound quality. I had a water-resistant model before that fell apart with the elements, and it sounded very tinny. Not sure how well this will hold up yet, but for the price point at good sound quality, I'm pretty happy with it. Does it sound as good as my JBL one that I keep indoors?  No, but it's pretty darn good comsidering it's 1/3 the price I paid for the JBL. Is it loud yet clear with no distortion and adequate bass and highs?  You bet!  Which is perfect for a permanent patio bluetooth speaker, especially considering how small it is!!!!",5,1,2017-4-13,1,1,0
"This is my second oontz, and it is just ok. I kept reading the reviews and I thought I would give it another chance. Clearly it seems many people like it and think it is a great product. I am less than an amateur and there is nothing really wrong with the speaker it is just that the sound is hollow, like under water. My comparison is an old (like 10 year old!) Sony speaker and I was hoping this would replace it but as unlikely as it sounds my old speaker sounds so much better!",2,1,2018-1-16,1,1,0

"If you're thinking about buying this, THINK NO MORE!!!! This is the best and most amazing speaker I have ever bought!!! It delivered FAST to my house and this thing is LOUD. I can only turn it up half way in my room because of how loud this thing gets. Another perk is it came fully charged! I received it the 22nd of September and I hooked up my phone and played music/videos for HOURS every single day and it FINALLY died September 30th! THATS OVER A WEEK!!!!! The battery life is incredible!!! I use this thing every single day. This is one of the best things I have ever bought! I absolutely recommend this speaker to everyone! It's nice and light and compact but packs a loud punch! If mine ever broke, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. AWESOME!!!!!!",5,1,2017-10-3,1,1,0
i got this in aug. and worked great for the first coupe of uses.  charged it and only worked for a few minutes. been trying to get something done.  even bought the warranty for it. i'm getting a refund for the speaker so much for the warranty though.

I am very impressed with this little speaker!! The audio is clear and fills my kitchen with great sound without having to max out the volume. I LOVE the compact size of this speaker. It fits nicely on my window sill behind my sink and is splash proof so I dont worry about moving it to wash dishes or pressing pause while my hands are wet. It connects as soon as my bluettoth is tuned on which is lovely! I wish it had an auto off feature but that is such a minor thing and otherwise this speaker is fantastic. I've owned two JBL Clips and A JBL charge 3 and this is the speaker I would recommend out of the group.  Very much worth the $25.00. If we buy any more speakers for our room or bathroom this will be what we get.*update* 8/18/18 I accidently discovered that long pressing either volume button skips the song forward (+) or backwards (-). Good to know!,5,1,2018-8-6,1,0,0
"Received this item well before the ETA; the sound is incredible for such a small speaker that you can hold in your hand. The bass is amazing, and doesn't rattle (I listen to a lot of heavy bass songs), and its loudest setting doesn't sound scratchy or reverb-heavy. I can hear it clear across my house from the farthest room, and even outside, when it's at its loudest setting (this would certainly be house-party friendly, and the price is exceptional for the quality). I would recommend this product to anyone wanting an amazing Bluetooth speaker on a budget (it also has an Aux cord, if you'd prefer wired-in listening). I don't listen to it all day, every day, but I have yet to charge it since completely charging it the first time, so that makes cleaning a breeze when I want to get down while scrubbing some dishes. Cambridge SoundWorks also has an incredible customer service team that keeps you in the know when your package is shipped, and makes sure to e-mail you about a week after your purchase to see if you're satisfied with their product. I, surely, am. 5/5 stars!",5,1,2017-10-12,1,1,0
"Excellent little speaker. It's about size of plastic water bottle small ones. And it's great sound. Simple ease use. Had it up and working in 2 minutes. Connect to echo dot and have great sound. This is perfect little speaker. The only complaint I have is the volume controls on top are black in color same as the whole speaker is, and unless your in bright room light, I cannot see the buttons to turn up/down/off/etc, they are virtually invisible, very hard to see. I'm thinking of painting the little + and - symbols with white out in order to see.",4,1,2018-2-24,1,0,0

Great little blue tooth speaker.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"The device has an arty design which seems to make it difficult to operate.  The operation is generally unreliable, as if it had bad moods or intermittent dementia.  The volume is not great.  The quality of the sound is usually passable if you can get it to work at all.  It appears that a few more 'generations' will be needed to bring it up to speed.",1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"This is my second angle after a few years. I had wanted the features the new one has. The improvements are night and day!The best one is the amount of bass it puts out. But not bloated bass, it's clean and detailed. I would say the sound is very forward and natural. I am truly impressed with this speaker. The next feature is very good as well, mainly for the shower. It is very water resistant. The rubber is thick and soft, I like the feel. The weight is just enough to make it feel like a bargain. Also there are cases that are made for it and that adds unique character to it. I think this is better than my flip 2. One of the best deals in Bluetooth speakers.",5,1,2016-4-28,1,1,0

"This has got to be the worst-designed piece of electronics I've ever purchased. It's silly all-black design makes it hard to use: only one of the three sides is the speaker but since all sides are black, you'll find yourself constantly turning it; the ""buttons"" are all-black, too, and after eight months I still had to hold the darned thing right under the light to see what button did what.  BUT WORST OF ALL: the portal for recharging is in the worst place and is cheap, cheap, cheap.  In less than 7 months the cord no longer stayed in the portal on its own.  I'm not about to wrap the darned thing in electrical tape to try and get it to charge so the speaker is GARBAGE.  DON'T BUY THIS!",1,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"I bought this December 2015 and it will no longer charge as of 4/2020.  5 years is a good long time, but I'd sure be happier if it kept charging.

I may not have tested the splash proof part but it did get a little wet in light rain and i see no problem with quality. I have add images from about 3months ago and it still look nice. Its a portable Bluetooth speaker, good for traveling ( which i do a lot). I have hardly got a chance to check its top volume capacity because with 75% volume its fills a room with music. Its got a very good Bass capability and strong vocal. Bass is not as good as Bose but it sure gives a very good fight ( that too at 1/5 th or 1/6th the cost).

"When I purchased this speaker, I didn't expect much. I simply wanted a portable speaker to listen to music around the house rather than through my headphones. When I received the speaker, quickly connecting via bluetooth to my tablet and phone without any issue, the music immediately filled the room. Rich, clear and full with plenty of bass. In fact, it actually surprised me how clear and full the sound was that came from this speaker. This speaker is far more than I expected.Small, lightweight, easy to set up and excellent sound. I'm sure there are more expensive and possibly better speakers out there, if you are looking for all the small details that add up the price. This speaker is simple in function while giving full, deep, rich sound. At full volume, it fills the room completely with solid sound. Much more than I expected. I am pleasantly surprised by this speaker and I know it will tend to all my listening needs.",5,1,2017-3-4,1,1,0
"Sound is surprisingly good.  You wouldn't expect this kind of sound from something so compact.  What I don't like is that it will shut itself off after just a few minutes of not using it.  When you want to use it again, you have to physically press and hold the power button.  I also bought the Magic Box 2 for another room, and it does not have that problem.  Another problem I found is that, while you can blast the volume all the way up, doing so will make the unit vibrate violently, to the point where it can fall off of whatever platform it's on.  Lastly, I found I can pretty much walk anywhere in my 3 story house with the Magic Box 2, on the contrary if I walk more than 10 feet away from this this unit (with the Bluetooth signal source), the connection gets glitchy/choppy.  Overall, I do recommend it, but there is room for improvement here.",3,1,2015-11-19,1,0,0
"I have been enjoying my new Oontz  speaker on our screened in porch. It is plenty loud enough to fill the area. Sound quality is clear and precise.  I like being easily portable so I can take with me to other areas of the house. Honestly I get tired of wearing headphones and ear buds just bug the crap out of me, so this is a perfect solution. I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend this great little speaker. Thanks!",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
My 808 canz stopped playing on me it charges but won’t turn on so I decided to buy this. This is the same usb cord and cord for laptop to play as my 808 canz so it works out. This speaker does come with its cord but it’s always nice to ave them handy. It is loud and when it blast it vibrates nice and doesn’t give that static sound like my old speaker.,5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"I quick ordered this for an outdoor party, in which I wanted to be able to play my Pandora play list from my phone.  I got it the next day and it literally took only a minute or two to pair it with my phone and I was able to play my music.  I can't say exactly how long the battery lasts, but it's definitely at least 8 hours.  I had it turned on before the party, which lasted 6 hours, and long afterwards. I feel that the sound quality was very good. Great little speaker for the price!",5,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
"This review is for OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) - Bluetooth Portable Speaker.  Great little speaker.  I don't use this as a portable speaker so I don't know about the battery life.  The speaker is always connected to the power outletlet.  The bluetooth works great. After the speaker is paired with your device, the connection is very fast.  I use my iphone to connect to it for playing music.  The sound quality is very good.",5,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0
"Wasn’t expecting so much for such a cheap price. It paired with my phone in 2 seconds and it’s louder than it looks. It sounds great for being so cheap and small. It’s smaller length wise than my iPhone 11 and it weighs about a pound. Used it in the shower and it works well. So you can adjust the volume and pause and hit play with the side buttons but for me the skip back and forward buttons don’t work. But! For the price of it, it’s no big deal. I’m considering buying another one to have for my desk at home. I like it and so should you!",5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
Love this small but mighty unit. The sound quality is great. The sound remains crisp and clear even when played loud. The bass is sufficient and doesn't muffle or rumble when loud.

"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS.Me and my roommates use it in the shower all the time, and in general, it is a great bluetooth speaker for the apartment. It can be VERY loud (which was not expected!!!) I LOVE that it can be very loud without distorting the sound quality!!! Great for parties, great for showers, just overall wonderful. Love love love!!! The base is amazing and it connects easily to devices. Love this!",5,1,2017-5-26,1,2,0
"I really liked this unit, although there were runs I'd have preferred it to have a little more volume. But my only real issue with it is that the unit is that after about 9 months of use it stopped charging, which made it a paperweight, as even when plugged in directly to the charging cable it still won't function",2,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"Nice, clear sound at low volumes, but when i crank it up, the small speakers distort the sound.  My test case was Led Zeppelin's classic, ""Heartbreaker.""  That is tough for any system.

"I rarely ever write reviews, but I’m happy with this purchase. So far, it has worked as advertised, and several people have commented on the good sound quality. The connection is also surprisingly strong. I can play music on the speaker from my phone several rooms away. I have yet to find a distance that doesn’t work. The battery life seems to be pretty good as well. I don't have very much experience with Bluetooth technology, but it works! I have nothing to complain about. 👍🏻👍🏻",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I am one of those old fogies who resist 'modern' things. My husband is far more progressive & when he convinced me to try Pandora, I actually liked it. Then he went on a quest to make the listening experience better for me--even though I tried to tell him I have a tin ear & the speaker in my phone is perfectly adequate. He ordered this & I love it. It sounds so much better than the phone--I had no idea it would make such a difference. Thank goodness for such a wonderful man--he enhances my life!",5,1,2017-12-12,1,1,0
"I am a musician and frequently need to record things at a very low input level in order to avoid distortion.  It is hard to find a portable speaker that will allow immediate playback from such a recording at a volume that is loud enough to hear.  It usually requires some processing, which defeats the purpose of portability.  This one does it, no processing necessary.  It puts out some serious volume for something that size with very little distortion.  The bluetooth connectivity is quick and seamless and the aux jack makes it even more adaptable.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"This speaker stopped working after one full use. I charged it, and now it won't turn on. I've tried everything, and I've gone through all their troubleshooting tips on their website. When it's plugged in the red light comes on, but you can't use it when it's charging, and as soon as I unplug the charger, it won't turn on. None of the buttons work.

"Hi folks, got my speaker yesterday and impressed with the craftsmanship of the little guy but it really does not deliver especially on bass. But I am generally please based on price.A year ago, I bought a few TDK A33s for myself and family at $60 each. Now that was by far among some of the best steals I have had on Amazon. Lost my power cord and reordered. Check price now.",3,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0
I like the OontZ Angel 3 bluetooth speaker so far! I like the design & the sound quality is excellent for a small bluetooth speaker! Very easy to connect to & easy to operate! There are 2 little speakers inside the box that give off excellent sound & bass! Only downside is the battery life is around 4 hours when the volume is maxed out! Not a bad speaker for under $30 dollars!,4,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"So far I've had no problems with connectivity and I have been pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. I purchased to use with my laptop in my office so I didn't have speaker wires everywhere.

"Wow! Now let me say that i am a music and speaker junkie, I’ve been installing car audio for years and I was a little skeptical buying this. I was looking at JBL because lets face it, we all rather buy the name brand than by something we never heard of, at least I never heard of. Let me just say that this little speaker packs a punch. Bass is ok, especially if you have it against a wall. Loudness? Omg I didn’t expect it to be as loud as it was. Well packed, looks nice, and it can fill a apartment with no problem. Spotify +Equalizer and volume up a little will definitely fill your need to jam out. Highly recommend it, for the price it doesn’t get any better trust me.",5,1,2017-12-2,1,0,0

I bought this product to replace my Motorola SOL republic speaker. At first I was a little hesitant to purchase it but the reviews were just too good to pass up. Does it compete with the $150+ Bose or the $100 Speaker it replaced? No. It does a damn fine job as a replacement though. I couldn't bring myself to spending that much after how well this thing has performed. I normally use this as music while I am working in the yard or garage. It get gets decent loud and has great range. It lacks a little in the low end bass but for the price it simply cannot be beat. Like I have said I cannot justify spending three time this amount for a little more output when this does what I need it to do and is splash resistant. Awesome purchase.,5,1,2016-10-3,1,0,0
"Stopped working after six weeks. I plugged it in to charge one night, never worked again. It was used gently and never exposed to water. Amazon makes it impossible to contact the seller.

"Crystal clear sound quality. Bought this to go to the beach, sand and water proof. Very durable, I just threw it in the beach bag and had no worries. I love that it is blue tooth and once its hooked up to your device (I use my phone), you just turn it on and it automatically hooks up. The battery lasts a long time and this speaker is LOUD. I like that you can change the volume on the speaker as well as on your device. Speaker does not answer to voice commands, but is your basic, quality speaker.",5,1,2017-9-13,1,1,0
Buyer beware!  This speaker only works for about a year and then stops completely. The bluetooth connectivity stops and you will be left with a triangular piece of unusable garbage.  Do not expect to get any help from the manufacturer either.  They are providing a product with a very short shelf life and they do not care. Would never buy any of their products again.,1,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"I have taken this speaker on a couple of vacation trips and I've been using it while working on a few home improvement projects.  First of all, the sound is great for such a compact speaker! Crisp clear highs and surprisingly robust bass on the low end. I haven't pushed the battery to its limits, but I know it's good for 3 or 4 hours, no problem. And I like the fact I don't have to worry about using it in damp environments.  Simple to use and charge.  I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2018-9-13,1,0,0
The sound is great...when it works. Shortly after receiving the speaker the audio started to skip. Made sure the battery was charged and it was sitting right next to the computer it was connected to....still had skipping audio issues. I've tried every trouble-shooting method to fix it and none of them work. The reset button for the speaker is also inside the speaker so you need a paper clip to reach in and reset it. Whoever thought of that design idea I have no idea how you make it through the day without getting hit by a bus. You get what you pay for with this speaker. Cheap price. Cheap results. I don't recommend it.,1,1,2019-1-12,1,1,0
"About the size of a triangular can of soda. Set up is simple. Sound is pretty decent for the small size. The only thing I don't really like is how the power LED works. It comes on momentarily when you turn it on then goes out. Turning it off requires you to hold the power button for three seconds, but it's not really clear that it turns off unless you are using BT and see the BT connection drop. It powers off by itself after a while anyway and probably doesn't use much power in standby, but I would have preferred a more obvious indication of off/on.",4,1,2018-2-4,1,0,0
"Worked okay as a desktop speaker for about a year. Then would not function properly all of a sudden. 2 modes available when connected either BT Speaker or BT Hands free device.

"I can't offer a comment on battery life yet, but my intial feedback is the sound is a bit tinny. To be fair, I'm comparing to an older Bose SoundLink Bluetooth Mobile Speaker II which was a much more expensive device. It's batteries have quit so it only works when plugged in, and replacement batteries are almost 3X the cost of this device. It is OK for its cost, but if you're looking for full, rich sound, this isn't it.",3,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"So far so good! Sound quality is amazing, volume is outstanding, and portability is also a huge plus! It's super easy to carry along everywhere we go and can listen to it in any setting without it being too low in Lou's setting or too loud in quiet settings. The battery life is amazing! It's definitely worth the buy, could not recommend any other portable speaker and we've had plenty! Charging is pretty quick given how long the speaker goes without needing to charge also.",5,1,2018-11-23,1,0,0
"This is my first remote Bluetooth device. The unit produces GREAT sound and the con range is very good. I was surprised that I had to go into each different device and make it look for the speaker. My son said, ""Yeah, that's the way they work"". I've load a bunch of my CD's on my PC and iTuned them to several devices. I can shoot music from iPad, iPhone, an OLD NO-SIM iPhone, and old Android phone and a really old (1st gen?) IPad.

"This little speaker has a really great sound range and loudness. Also, the charge is great (approx. 9-10 hrs), especially compared to another wireless speaker I purchased (IESSENTIALS Bluetooth Hi-Fi Portable Speaker) which holds a charge for approx. 1 1/2 hr. The sound will definitely fill a room and also sounds great in openness (outside) with other noises going in the background (lawnmowers, loud cars etc.) In my pics I compared the size of the speaker to a 7 oz. container of coffee for potential buyers to get a good understanding of its size.",5,1,2018-6-19,1,0,1
"I bought this speaker less than a year ago and it suddenly died on me. I loved the sound and was pretty impressed with it for such a little speaker. I used it as a speaker for my computer. I started having problems with it turning on and off so I would just leave it plugged in all the time so I wouldn't have to fiddle with it in order to turn it on or off. So then today it just decided to die completely. It first had a stuttering sound so I unplugged it and then back in of course nothing from that point on. I went to check to see if I could get support for it and yes of course it says I am just after support time that ended in January, 2020. Yet it isn't even fully a year old bought in July, 2019. :(",2,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
I bought this thinking it would have really good bass because I thought it was originally priced as $99. The best test for speakers is to play a song like location or a Drake song with Bass. I played location by Khalid and the base just wasn't as nearly good as I wanted. Other than that this thing is awesome. The sound is Crystal Clear. Probably would be awesome to watch movies with it and we'll be doing that so I guess I'm going to bump this up to 5 to 4 stars instead of 3 period was going to originally rated as 3 due to the base but for the price I guess it's not that bad. Still really wish I had something that was really good bass and also saw my friend with one of these triangle looking things and it was a little bit bigger so I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger to but yeah,4,1,2017-7-10,1,2,0
"OH MY GOSH...... THIS LITTLE THING IS AMAZING!!! The first line says it all! I don't know what I was expecting but somehow I thought that if I wanted something to sound great it would have to be big, oh how I was wrong! When I opened the box the first thing I said was ""Well this is A LOT smaller than I thought it would be"" but I decided to pair it with my phone to measure its quality. It sounded great! The sound travels a great distance and its super clear. My last Bluetooth compatible speaker was huge and not only was it a disappointment when it was playing music but it always had trouble pairing with cell phones, not the case with the OontZ Angle. As soon as I turn this baby on it pairs with the last device it was connected to as long as it is in range. I used this at work once and my co workers have already bought one for themselves! I'm telling you, you won't regret this purchase!",5,1,2017-1-5,1,0,0
"I thought it would be smaller than the picture but it’s no it actually looks like the exact size. It may be small but it packs some bass and volume!

I’ve had this speaker for about 2 months I wanted to see if there would be any changes before I have a review of the product.",5,1,2018-11-21,1,2,0
"This thing packs a punch. When I first synced it up I was playing some Cold War Kids and the moaning bass notes flew out of there and filled the room in an instant. The angled face helps to project the sound throughout the room and the open bottom lets it breathe air to pump bass clearly. For its size, you can't beat the sound output. I especially like that it comes with a male-male 3.5 audio cable in case you don't have a bluetooth device. Syncing took five seconds and onboard volume and play/pause controls are a nice plus. I only wish they were easier to see, since it's just raised symbols on rubber.Overall I'm really happy with this purchase, it's precisely what I needed.",5,1,2016-12-23,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker to replace an older (different) Bluetooth speaker.  Turns out they aren't all the same.  Despite the positive reviews, I'm disappointed that it just feels like the bass is not very powerful and the volume isn't able to make the speaker nearly as effective when used outdoors.  It's a good speaker but definitely not a great one.",3,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

In a small space it was fine, but it side not very effective.",2,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0

The 'sleep' feature is especially handy when I fall asleep listening to it. The sound is crisp, clear, and gets pretty loud for its size.

Has a pause button on the speaker - a great feature if you're not next to the music source.  Also functions as a speaker phone. Small footprint - can be used sitting flat or on end.

I had it paired with my phone within about 30 seconds from unboxing and without looking at the instruction manual. Unusually, the instruction manual is very comprehensive and is in English only.The sound quality is amazing for the diminutive size of the device - it packs a lot of bass for its size.

"I bought this December of '15 because I got a new job being a bus driver for my university and we can use Bluetooth speakers to play music. It came right on time and sounded amazing right out of the box. It has great sound with plenty of bass, and the little rubber feet on the bottom are essential for putting it on any flat surface. I used the speaker every day for about 2 months, I used it in my car because that radio had gone out and also on the bus, so at least 4 hrs every week day. Then it stopped charging, I was rather frustrated because I had only had it for about a month and a half or two months and there was no reason for it to have stopped. So I went to the Cambridge SoundWorks website and EMAILED them with my story of what happened and how I really liked it but was disappointing that it stopped working. WITHIN THE HOUR I had a response from an actual person, not an automated message confirming that my email had been received, the polite lady asked me for my shipping address and with no questions asked, except for my amazon invoice number, she sent me a brand spanking new speaker!! I got the new one a few days later, it was rather quiet on my bus for those few days, and it worked perfectly just like the other one I did, now 5 months later I am still satisfied with my purchase and with the customer service of Cambridge SoundWorks. I will definitively recommend them to all of my friends who are looking for a speaker and will continue to buy from them because they have great products and amazing customer service. This speaker also has amazing volume without any distortion, I use it on my johnboat with a small outboard and I can still hear it perfectly. I also used it at a party I had in my backyard, which is pretty big for a back yard probably 30 yards squared. I hooked it up to my computer with the aux cord that came with it and with the charger then plugged my computer in to charge and it played music at just about full blast all night. The volume was perfect for about 30 people in the back yard and it didn't disturb the neighbors. All in all a great little speaker and well worth the money.",5,1,2016-5-12,1,1,0
"Now own both the next and the plus.  Next is a bit smaller which better fits the limited space on my desk.  Battery time is sufficient but on a desk, it's kept plugged in.  I moved the plus to the bathroom for when i shower.  Sound of the next is very similar to that of the plus, solid and plenty loud enough.  Also, using as a hands free device, those at the other end have no difficulty hearing.  Not a negative to me but note that you cannot daisy chain multiple units.",5,1,2017-9-13,1,1,0
"Given the glowing reviews, I'm not that impressed. It works ok, sure it plays loud enough, but to be honest how often do you play it at high volume?  Battery life is impressive, so that's nice.  I don't hear any bass at all though. I gave it a month of nearly daily use at work to see if it would break in, but no improvement.  Other reviews state that it has good sound quality, but it is almost all treble. I wasn't expecting miracles, but I did expect a little more. Maybe the newer version performs better?",3,1,2018-6-3,1,0,0

"Maybe this is a nice speaker. But if you are using any version of Windows prior to 10 you will never find out because the device will not pair correctly. If you then dig deep into the Cambridge Sound website you will find that they admit this in the smallest of print. Shouldn't that instead be right on the Amazon page?  If you need to pair a speaker with a laptop that runs Windows 8 or earlier, this is not for you.",1,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
I enjoyed this speaker for less than a year.  I contacted the seller because it just stopped working.  The seller said it has a 30 day warranty (ridiculous) and offered for me to ship it to them for repair.  I would have to pay shipping and handling fees.  This is a $21.99 speaker.  In my opinion this is just POOR customer service.  I rarely leave bad reviews for anyone but this really annoyed me.,1,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"This speaker is AMAZING! I'm in love with this speaker! The sound quality is wonderful! It is clear, and LOUD! It is perfect to take to the beach, pool, camping, or anywhere where you want to play your music loud and proud. This is so worth the money. It is so easy to use and pair up with your blue tooth device. I have a lot of mh favorite songs on my iPhone and I had no trouble at all pairing them together. I'm so pleased with this product. Trust me, you must buy this one, you won't be sorry.",5,1,2017-6-30,1,1,0
I love this little speaker. It’s super ez to pair with ur device and ez to turn on and off. If u try to use ur device with the speaker on u’ll hear some loud sounds associated with typing every letter and other normal functions. So u have to turn Bluetooth on/off as needed. But it works great for my purposes.,5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0

"I rarely write reviews, but felt this was necessary. 2 stars rating because sound quality is actually good, but that’s where the good ends. Unit does not have an off button and won’t power down, which means unit goes dead after each use. Then we’ve also had issues with charging the unit, and Bluetooth connection failing when Bluetooth device is within 10 feet of the speaker. Very disappointed and unfortunately not worth the $$.",2,1,2018-1-4,1,1,0

"First off I'm a big fan of CSW products. From my first Ensamble speaker set to my Oontz XL. Sad the moved out of Massachusetts but I digress.One of the three units came with Bluetooth connection issues. The speaker was given as a Christmas gift to my parents for their summer home and was not used immediately (6 months). Need less to say when we did charge and fire it up the Bluetooth connection was intermittent and would cancel out. Customer Service, thank you Jennifer, resolved the issue quickly and for a minimal fee replaced the defective unit. So one star off for the defective unit. Now for the review.",4,1,2016-10-15,1,0,0
Are used to own the earlier version of the speaker. And I just received this and I am super impressed with the quality for what it is. I just need a small speaker in a room and I’m not disappointed.

GREAT speaker for the money!",5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
"So keep in mind this is a rating for a 30 dollar speaker. If you think you are going to get the high end of a high priced speaker, your wrong. For a 30 dollar speaker tho this thing is impressive! Out of alot of cheaper speakers this is by far amazing. Nice sturdy, quality look and feel. Sounds good, and battery life is great.

"I honestly wasn't expecting much from this device because of its small size and low cost, but saw that it was made by Cambridge (or at least they allow their label to be put on it) so I tried it. This little bugger puts out way more volume and bass than I would ever have expected and is well worth the money.

A lady that works for Cambridge reached out and contacted me and apologized that I received a damaged one and replaced it with a new one within days and included a free case as well which I thought was a nice touch.

Works  without being plugged in.  Never quit learning.",5,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
I am not overly picky on sound quality as I mostly listen to thrash and punk so on that point the sound is great. I got this for my home office so I don't have to wear headphones all the time and it paired easily and the charge lasts well.

"Not sure I've ever written a review, but I feel compelled to review this amazing product. I bought this speaker a year ago, and a second several months later. Sound has always been optimal for such a small and cost effective piece of technology. And connection couldn't be easier. The real reason for review is that my wife decided to put the speaker through a wash cycle with our laundry. To be fair, it was a perm press cycle with warm water, single rinse. Nonetheless, it was washed thoroughly. It was caught in the transition to the dryer. Amazingly, this little speaker fired right up and sang sweet music into my unsuspecting ear. Moreover, sound was just as clean and crisp as day one. Washer proof! Not sure about dryer proof, stay tuned...",5,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
Sound quality is just ok. I was surprised at how very small the speaker is.  Bluetooth connectivity is awesome and very responsive. I do not like how you have to press the volume buttons repeatedly to change the volume. If you hold the volume button down too long it skips to the next song. That’s annoying.,3,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"For the price I don't know if this thing could be beat.  We ordered a $22 rectangular shaped speaker from some random company and it was only as loud as my phone.  I got this one for $27.99 and it is the bomb.  My wife is listening to it 2 rooms over with the door shut and I can hear it perfectly.  It gives off enough base and paired immediately with our Samsung S5.  Also it comes with USB cord and 3.5mm input.  Not many electronics come with extras like that.  I wish that it had USB 3.0 for a more rapid charge and complete compatibility, but micro USB 2.0 is compatible and readily available.  I just used the charger for one of my old tablet/phones.  We were looking into the $150 to $200 range.  My wife asked me after listening how much it cost.  She was blow away at the price.  Oh and it's splash resistant for the bathroom/beach/pool/humidity.",5,1,2015-12-15,1,0,0

"Easy to set up and operate. Sounds good, but I wish it was a bit louder, but I can't complain for the size. It produces good sound at half-volume or less, then slight tinniness at higher volumes, again about what I would expect from such a small speaker. I like it. I'm going to keep it, but if I had to buy a similar one I'd search for a speaker with a bit more power and volume. I'll say though for the price offered this is a great little speaker.",4,1,2017-11-1,1,1,0
"What an impressive little device! I wanted a speaker for my garage (3 car) so I could listen to some music while I tinker with house projects. Didn’t want to spend a lot of money on it because I didn’t need a big boomer box. This not only met all of my expectations, but totally blew me away at how nice it sounds! It’s loud and can fill the garage very well with my music. The clarity is amazingly good. In short, the sound that comes out of this little baby does not match the size of it. Don’t know how they did it, but I’m thoroughly impressed!",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
I liked the least that it wasn’t cheaper. I like that i can use it on my samsung smart phone and apple ipad. I have 800 Sq feet in my apartment and I can move from room to room with little or no distortion. It syncs quickly with blue tooth and sounds a noise when connected. I like that. I feel that the bass has a true representation as does the highs. I like deep bass and I’m satisfied with Cambridge design. I thought this product was affordable. The Oontz angle 3 would make a great gift it’s what I wanted and never got but had to buy myself. LOL.,5,1,2018-3-13,1,0,0
"I have only owned this speaker for about 24 hours, but I already started noticing an issue. If I moved it at all, the sound became interrupted repeatedly. I can’t tell if this is a bigger issue with the actual speaker, or if I just need to keep it still and it will work fine. But it lost sound with slight motion. I will update this with any future concerns, changes.Otherwise, the sound is excellent from the hour or so I listened to music. I have a Bose portable speaker, and I can say that I wasn’t disappointed by my initial listening experience with this speaker. I hope it doesn’t disappoint later! I’ll buy one for each room of the house, if this continues to work.",3,1,2018-12-5,1,0,0
"Incredible sound, but that goes without saying for a Cambridge Soundworks product. Granted there are louder speakers of similar size but none have the tonal quality and low distortion of this speaker. Give me quality over quantity any day. This will fill an avg room with louder than conversation music. I use mid vol mostly as it is almost as loud as full vol and battery lasts longer.  I do not have a Db meter so cannot be more specific on vol. I just gave away and sold another name brand as the sound quality of this Oontz just shamed them.",5,1,2018-2-23,1,0,0
"This unit is small in size, in fact it's smaller in comparison to the photos seen here online, but though it's small in size (which is a great thing) the sound is HUGE, clear and crisp even at cranked volume levels.

"I really like this little speaker!  The audio is crisp and clear, and as others have written, does not have a lot of bass.  But what  you get is a small stereo speaker that is portable pretty loud and the batteries last quite a while.  I have used it for 6 or 7 hours straight and it still has battery power left and was able to use it for another few hours.The power button is on the back, and since it is black like the rest of the speaker and blends in they added an arrow to find it.

"For a regular person who wants music played in the background while I'm in the shower, while I'm cleaning the apartment, maybe for occasional house parties/gatherings/game nights, this is a great bluetooth speaker. It plays the music loud enough, clear, and with good bass which is what I like. I'm not a sound expert or too picky about the qualities of sound and I don't need it for anything special, but to my normal ear that enjoys good quality sound, this is perfect. It also lasts a long time before it needs to charge. It's easily portable and seems durable. Highly recommend for every day use.",5,1,2017-11-30,1,0,0
Speaker is ok but it keeps shutting off even though it is plugged into power all the time. Don’t know about battery life as I don’t use it that way.

"As the first one to wake up in the morning, I needed something to use that didn’t wake up the whole house while getting ready for the day. I’ve had it for nearly two months and use it to hear music and traffic reports on the radio while in the bathroom/showering/dressing for work. It was easy to connect (iPhone6Plus), set up, charge, and use. The sound quality is nice - sometimes the radio Morning personalities have a more bass voice setting that makes it difficult to understand (for me, anyways) when settings are set for optimal rock music sound. The size allows it to easily fit in shower and carries the sound clearly without blaring. The initial charge on the unit has lasted since first charged. Use is appropriately 20 minutes 5x a week.",5,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
"I received this as a gift, and the sound that came out of this little speaker made me look twice!  I've had (brand name) speakers twice it's size that didn't sound half as good, I cannot believe the depth of the sound.  The design was obviously well thought out, it has rubber for non-slip stability, so it isn't going to fall over if you're using it in the car, plus it looks great in my office.  An excellent product is great, but what makes it a true quality product are the people who support it.  I had a couple of little hick-ups in the beginning and I haven't encountered customer support as outstanding as those at Cambridge SoundWorks in a very long time.  Those two things combined make this a product that I not only will recommend to all of my friends, but I plan on getting more of their speakers for my house and out on the porch for summer parties!",5,1,2016-1-20,1,0,0
"This is one powerful loud speaker with great quality. I bought this to take to the beach and the only complaint I have is that sand sticks to the stickey rubber and is very difficult to get off. In addition, the bottom of the speaker has vents that sand can easily get into. Aside from that, this thing packs a mean punch for it's size. I have a Bose Mini speaker as well which has is much better with better bass but how can you compare a $27 speaker to a $200 one. That said, for $27, it is worth every penny. I plan to buy one of these for my sister and best friend too. Btw, the case that I bought for this speaker is the Cosmos® Black Color Travel Carry Neoprene Sleeve Case Bag Cover for OontZ Angle Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (NOT for OontZ Angle plus) which fits like a glove and only costs $5 :)",5,1,2016-1-11,1,0,0

"Good speaker.  Quirk about setup if you're using a wired connection instead of Bluetooth:I bought these to be the output for multiple Echo Dots.  If you want Amazon's multiple room audio, you can't have the Dots communicate with the speakers via Bluetooth because they won't allow multiple Bluetooth connections at once.  No problem, it seemed -- these come with a 3.5mm audio cable.  But when I tried to use it, it created loud static through the speaker even without any music playing.  The static occurred on multiple speakers and multiple Dots, so it wasn't just a lemon.  It would go away if I used Bluetooth or left the speaker on battery, but I wanted all wired setup.",4,1,2017-10-29,1,0,0

Outside the signal gets pretty weak at about 50', not 100', again with only 1 wall between the computer and speaker. Still, for the price and what I use it for, it's worth the $.

For the price, it is an okay speaker at the best. After reading a ton of great reviews I figured it would be a banging speaker when in reality it has almost zero bass. The bass factor I would give a 2/10 probably, not impressed at all. But the sound quality is fairly clear until you get cranking on it good so I'd give that an 8/10. I can't say I'm completely disappointed but I'm not very impressed. I'd rather go back and take the risk and try out another one from the previous brand I bought bc it was 50X the speaker this thing is.

I bought this for work and left it there for anyone to use. So needless to say it got a LOT of use(12-20hrs a day 7 days a week). It had OK sound quality and great battery life(5hrs without a plug at high volume at least). The range was a good 40-50 ft which was nice as employees walked around a lot with their phones in their pockets. Sadly it gave out about 8 months later from a smashed in charging port.

The connection to my phone was as easy as pressing a button and I feel like the sound quality is wonderful. I do like it better when the length of the speaker is laying down.

However, I had received two where the bluetooth would not connect properly or at all.  So 2 stars.  If you get one that works - it will be worth it for you.",2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"I like to have a computer in the kitchen to watch shows while I cook.  I bought a small cheap dell - it works great but sound is not loud enough for my purposes.  I connected two speakers to it and it was ""OK"".  Then I saw this speaker on sale on Amazon and thought I would give it a try.  It is perfect!!  Makes my little cheap computer sound like it is one of the ""big guys"".",5,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
"This is a great sounding speaker for the size and price.  This little speaker has awesome sound.  As you would expect the base is limited but to increase it, place the speaker in a corner on a counter.  In small rooms like the bathroom/shower it sounds great and has plenty of volume.  The charge seems to last forever.  I just periodically charge mine.  I've never run out of battery.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"This speaker is very useful for enhancing audio from my TV. Importantly, I can place the speaker nearby and isolate the audio to myself, without disturbing others.

"I bought these a year ago Christmas for my kids.  I have heard no complaints about them and I can say from experience, that they have performed well.  My daughter brings it into the bathroom while she showers; my son connected it with his PC and connects with music and games.  They are both very happy with them.  My other kids have not commented on this and I think if there were issues, they would have mentioned it so that I wouldn't repeat it as a gift.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"I've have used this speaker for on-average 4 hours a day, for over 2 years now. I use it constantly (getting ready in the morning, driving, working out, etc.) and its taken a many hits and drops as I also take it on rock climbing/mountain biking trips. it still works like I bought it yesterday. If anything the battery might have a slightly shorter life span, but not by much. great product, as it actually lasts!",5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
"I wasn't expecting much but I wanted something cordless. This surprised me; not only is it considerably louder than I expected but it's got a really decent range. I can be anywhere on the same floor with the speaker, carrying my tablet with me, and it stays connected. The audio is clear and crisp with a surprising amount of bass, and the device itself is small and compact. It connected easily and quickly to my Dragon Touch X10 Android tablet and seems to keep a charge for several hours (I charge it routinely, I haven't let it run completely down yet). It's been well worth the price and I'd buy another if this one quit - it's been perfect for my needs.",5,1,2017-7-1,1,0,0
I ordered this speaker to use as we built our house. This speaker performed as advertised. It ran for about 8 hours on one charge and probably would have kept on playing. I had to charge my cell phone before this speaker ran out of juice. I did follow the recommendation and put my cell phone volume at about 75%. It was plenty loud and the speaker itself could have been louder. Great product!,5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
"Speaker quality is tremendous. The sound output is both rich and loud for a fairly small speaker. However, the mic quality is very poor. I attempted several test calls using this device, no more than 2 feet from my mouth while sitting at my desk. The people on the other end of the call said that it sounded like I was in a cave or tunnel and that my voice was hardly recognizable. Definitely not good enough quality to use as a speakerphone. As a portable speaker it seems great, but not what I need to conduct phone calls from my home office. I need to find a better device, this one will be returned.",3,1,2018-4-11,1,0,0
"Love the sound on this little speaker, and the battery lasts forever. Sadly, while it connects beautifully to my phone, connection with my Macbook Air is horrid. Sitting a foot away, it's nothing but dropouts. Very frustrating, since I bought it to pair with the Macbook when I travel. So I use it as a bathroom speaker to connect with my phone, but I will have to find another brand to travel with.",4,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
"This little thing booms! Purchased 2 speakers in 2 different brands and should have gotten 2 of these. This little thing is a powerhouse. Do wish there was a little tab to pull on for the usb access, is a bit hard to get a grip on but have no doubt that it keeps the water out. Allows me to skip a song ahead or go back and volume control also on deck. If the 2nd purchase dies, I will be replacing with a 2nd Oontz Angle 3",5,1,2018-1-9,1,1,0
"Can't believe all the positive, glowing reviews with regard to sound. To me it has the sonic quality of a 60s transistor radio albeit with much more bass. It was immediately apparent it didn't sound good. Some reviews mention the superiority of the Ultra, but given I couldn't trust the Angle 3's reviews, buyer beware. Also tried the JBL Flip 4 and it was an improvement but still not satisfying. Was looking for a compact speaker for travel so size was important. I settled on a used Bose SoundLink Mini which I know costs more, but I guess its true about getting what you paying for. Much fuller, smoother and better sound stage audio. I've read some good things about Tribit X-Boom which may be a contender, but have not heard it yet. All testing was done hard wired through Aux with iPod. Never tried Bluetooth or tested battery life.",1,1,2019-3-3,1,0,0
"I wish I could give this MORE than 5 Stars! This is an amazing speaker and has exceeded every expectation that I had for it. It can play so loud that I can listen to music all around the entire house (2000 sqft), it is also louder than my children (BONUS), it is EASY to use, the materials it is made out of feel nice in your hands, and this THANG has some awesome BASS. If you need a small portable speaker I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker. Also, they have great customer service!",5,1,2017-7-19,1,1,0
This speaker is great! First thing I love is that it’s tiny! So I can fit it in almost any bag. And the size doesn’t affect the sound range or quality. We mainly use it for the pool and I use it to listen to podcasts while doing housework. I am able to leave it downstairs and I can hear it upstairs clearly. It was easy to sync to my phone and and the battery lasts a very long time. I forgot the charger when I took it on a weekend trip and the battery lasted until we got home. I like it just as much as the JBL Charge 3.,5,1,2018-9-2,1,0,1
"Basic great little Bluetooth speaker for the price.Just to clearify I use this indoors so I can’t speak about how it handles the weather. Plenty loud for my needs, I leave it plugged in most of the time. When I’ve had it unplugged the battery seemed to last without dying. The distance that I’ve used it away from the sending unit has been around 50’.",5,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0
"Bought three of these and only one works sufficiently. When you go raise the volume to a normal or normal/above level, the crackling starts.

"I unboxed this little speaker and am so happy with my purchase, it's perfect for me. It connected easily with no issue and keeps the connection throughout my house. It's smaller than I imagined, but powerful. The sound is good, nice highs and lows and even bass, with a range of music. The charge lasts a long time, too (haven't counted the hours but it's been a while). I haven't tested the water resistancy and don't plan to, but I'm hoping it holds up at the beach with a bit of protection (don't want to risk damaging it). Recommend.",5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
I had to change my review on this speaker because I didn't even have it for 6 months before it started messing up. When I first got the speaker it held a charge for 4 to 5 days but as time went on it held less and less of a charge. After only having it for 10 months it completely stopped connecting to any of my devices. On top of that it would also only hold a charge for a half a day before needing to be plugged back in. I should have listen to the other bad reviews warnings. This speaker was honestly not worth it in the long run and I would not buy it again nor would I recommend it to anyone.,1,1,2018-2-18,1,0,1
"Cute compact design. Excellent bluetooth connection ease!!  Very good sound generally but its volume doesnt match its reviews and claims in my mind. Im 74, have good hearing and don't like loud music/noises but this unit doesnt get loud enough to annoy even me. Good for my bedside table, almost good enough for showering but way short of useful in the garden with any ambient noise.",3,1,2017-7-9,1,2,0
"This speaker has not worked from the day I bought it.  I charged it as directed, paired my phone per Bluetooth.  It would work for about a minute then start screeching.  I never got it to work correctly. I recently came across it after putting it out of sight.  Now it won't even charge up.  Junk! I wish I had sent it back the first week I got it.",1,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"For $20 it's pretty good.Breaking this speaker in, it's actually really loud and high quality. One thing I noticed is that when going really high in volume, the highs and the mids seem to kind of distort because they're trying really hard to be loud like if it's trying to surpass its maximum volume, but don't get me wrong clarity is of the finest quality of this product. It really has a great base and when you set it down on a table you can feel it, obviously it's not body trembling bass , But you can definitely feel it on the device itself. One last thing the rubber outlining on the edges seem to be coming off really easily I feel like it's not adhesive strong enough. Kind of sucks because I've only really had it for a little bit and I've barely hold onto it so it's already slowly starting to fall apart",4,1,2015-11-11,1,0,0
"Bought a pair of these speakers. They are a nice little unit that is easy to pair with your device. The battery life seems rather good, even at full volume. The sound is good, but just a bit muffled. Have had them for over a year now with daily use, and they seem to be holding up nicely. Would certainly recommend.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
If you get the black one it's great but if you go with the color one like the blue or red they suck go with the original or the black I have bought this speaker in the past that's why I reordered it knowing it was good and I seen the red one and got one too as well but do not recommend getting colored it was not that loud and didn't even sound like it had Bass but the black one you can clearly hear the bass and it's very loud,4,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
I’ve had a variety of Bluetooth speakers and so far I’ve liked this one for the bass. No other small form speaker shakes the table like this one. Unfortunately seven months later it does not work anymore. Wasn’t dropped hard or gotten wet. Normal use. The red charging LED just stayed on one day even when not charging and I wasn’t able to turn it on again. I let the battery die (since the red charging LED never turned off) and charged it again. Same thing. It’s a shame it can’t compete with the longevity of other speakers I’ve had since years before.,2,1,2018-5-22,1,1,0
"This small compact speaker can be used throughout the home room to room, sound quality is decent from being small, it has plenty of power. the Bluetooth communication is excellent until it needs recharging which it will last a week or so of average use.

This little speaker is wonderful in that I take it room to room and and can listen to my music and my audio books. The quality of sound is surprisingly great for such a small device. The battery goes for a very long time without recharging. Very VERY happy with this purchase.,5,1,2019-8-21,1,1,0
"I bought this Bluetooth speaker to play music from my iPhone 6, which has the worst speaker ever on a cellphone. There’s a million Bluetooth speakers and I got this one purely based on the fact that I could use Amazon Prime and the rating it had - because it’s not like I could listen to it before ordering. Anyway, I’m not completely thrilled with it. It’s a good size, battery life is great, connects with no problem, but the sound isn’t what I’d like at all. Lacking bass. The unit is equalized on the high end of the spectrum. For the price, I’ll keep it, but it isn’t what I was looking for in a Bluetooth speaker. To end on a positive note, it IS better than my iPhone speaker.",3,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0

After a few months, we had an issue charging it - for some reason the charge light wasn't going on. I contacted OontZ to ask them about it and I had a brand new one in my house two days later! Besides for being an awesome product, they have amazing customer service! Have been and will keep recommending to everyone!",5,1,2018-5-7,1,0,0
Excellent speaker. I like these and the Soundcores from Anker. I think they sound better than the JBLs and other high end speakers.

"Great speaker, lasted me almost two years everything worked well, sound good, connectivity good. Would’ve continued using this speaker but that is until it will no longer charge. Original charger broke, tried using multiple other usb chargers that i bought offline specifically for this speaker.

"Such a large, encompassing sound, pristine, sensitive and as loud as it can go, the sound is never too much for the speaker itself, which is so small.  I love it.  It brings out the background instruments very clearly and makes love to the voice/singer.  The only frustration I have is that the bass is just too weak coming out from the box because the bass is too strong for it.  This is my only complaint. Except be careful, songs are recorded at different levels and there is only so much the volume on the box can go up and down.  Try to record live recordings on songs you love but can't hear very well Live performances are usually louder.  Please buy this product.  You will not be disappointed.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0

I contacted the seller and asked if there was any trouble shooting I could do or if they had any suggestions on how to get it to work.  They immediately sent me out a brand new speaker.  So far it's been 2 weeks and everything working out well.",5,1,2017-1-5,1,0,0
"This was a great little speaker until the charging port stopped working. I'm pretty careful with stuff, so am disappointed that the charger no longer anchors in the port correctly, so can no longer charge it. Evidently, I'm not the only one with this issue as Googling it produced article on trying to repair it. But lacking soldering skills, I'm not up to the task.

Battery lasts forever (we've never actually ran it all the way down yet), we've charged just in case after long periods of use.

"This is my first bluetooth speaker, and very nice one.It is relatively small, and very light. Surprisingly, it has pretty good sound for the bluetooth connection.  I would not compare it to Bose $500 wired speaker, but for the size and price, it is very good. It paired well with my iphone and maintained connection while in the same room.Volume - this one does not control the volume on the player / phone, so the best option would be to set the phone's volume to the max, and adjust volume on the speaker after that.",5,1,2015-11-18,1,0,0
I bought this for my mom for Xmas this past year. She wanted a simple speaker so after some research I decided to pick this up. When it was shipped it came in a cheap cardboard looking box. After opening it and using it I was extremely impressed. I'm not going to lie I was a little thrown off by the packaging but I guess instead of spending money on the packaging they were able to make this a more affordable product.The sound is great and the volume gets pretty loud. If you're looking for a speaker for inside the house - OontZ is perfect.,5,1,2018-2-10,1,0,0
I am thoroughly impressed with this bluetooth speaker right out of the box. I was expecting it to have a lower quality sound but man this thing has some bass! I purchased it for my girlfriend because she wanted one that is waterproof for the shower. No complaints.

"Nice sound. I mean, it ain't Bose, but neither is the price. The sound is good enough for casual listening, and you can turn it loud enough to be annoying without turning Paul Simon into Nirvana. (Now that would be interesting. Too bad Kurt never covered Bridge Over Troubled Water. No, wait. It's okay. He knew what he was doing. Nevermind.) I wish there were a ""you left the unit on"" LED, but the power LED blinks only when you turn it on and then shuts off. It paired and reconnected easily enough.",5,1,2018-4-17,1,0,0

I'm no audiophile but this thing is so loud with absolutely no distortion, the bass is great and the sound is not tinny at all. Pairing the phone was easy, the microphone works well, the range exceeded my expectations. The specifications on this thing clearly nailed the competition at the price point. It did take a fall off my garage work bench when stood on its base at full volume but I missed the instructions to stand it on its edge at full volume to prevent this, its stills works though.

"This little speaker worked fine for about six weeks.  Then something went south. Thought it was not charging since the connection to the charging cable has always been loose (that is, cable falls off at slightest movement of the speaker.). As of today, when I push the On button, the speaker only stays on until I push Play on my phone.  Then it plays for a few seconds only, after which the speaker turns completely off and the audio switches back to my phone.  No patience for returning this as only paid about $20 for it.

I read a lot of reviews before settling on the Oontz Angle 3.  It sounds very good compared to a lot of others especially given the low price of under $30.  The bass is as impressive as you'd expect in a small speaker--  not a lot of bass but more than any others I've listened to.  It has a downward facing grill that emits the bass waves.  The key to improving the bass is to put it on something that will allow the low waves to resonate.  I tried it on several surfaces and the ones that worked best were on a trunk and on a shelf and the least effective was my heavy cherry wood desk which is thick and dense and absorbs sound.,4,1,2016-5-26,1,1,0

I also bring this into the shower with me when I feel like listening to music.One thing I don’t like is that the cable to charge the speaker has loosen up so it falls off while charging and sometimes i don’t even notice it until the speaker dies.  I have to put it in a specific position and or routinely check it and that sucks, especially when I’m doinb chores etc.",4,1,2018-6-10,1,0,0
"I can't say enough about the clarity and quality of sound of this product. It is rich and booming from such a small device, you would think you had a much larger speaker.  I use it in my shower mainly and the sound is awesome. That being said, what keeps it from 5 stars is the controls.  They are awkwardly placed on the side and not easily seen. I've used this several times, but I still have to hunt for the power button and some of the other controls. Also it needs a carabiner to attach to things.  If you buy the case, it comes with it but that's strictly for storage.  If they could update this with better design and engineering this would be a homerun killer wireless speaker.",4,1,2017-1-3,1,0,0
I love the speaker it's loud the base pretty good and the battery last for hours I love the Bluetooth features.Went ahead and bought my husbands one also.,5,1,2017-1-13,1,6,1
"It works great for phone calls while at my desk but not as powerful as I'd like to play music. I would recommend looking for higher wattage if you're wanting to play music and not right next to it but Cambridge Soundworks is always awesome equipment so I'd stick with the mfr., clarity is great.",4,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I originally purchased this to listen to music in my office after one of my coworkers showed me the great sound it provided for his office. However, when it arrived I was experimenting with the cord that allows you to attach it to other electronic devices. After plugging it into the back of my 75 inch flat screen TV I was blown away with the awesome surround sound effect this tiny speaker created. This one is staying in my living room. I'll have to buy a second one for my office.",5,1,2018-7-7,1,0,0
"The speaker works fine for about 15 minutes. Then it gets really static-y. We've tried everything we can think of to fix it. We put my phone right next to it and still the static occurred every time. Once it happens once, shutting it off and turning it back on only allows 1-2 minutes of clear sound. A total waste of money. With so many good reviews, I thought this would be so much better.",1,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
Wow 🤩! This is an 8th Grade Graduation Gift for our daughter . She chose this and I am THRILLED with the ease of using & sound quality ! It came out of the box ready to go - synced immediately to Bluetooth and the SOUND for a teeny affordable speaker is excellent !!! Now I want one of my own ! 👍,5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"This would have been unbelievable amazing a few years ago, sound quality, price, everything. So it's great, but it doesn't sound as good as the Anker Soundcor Nano, which is even cheaper and a lot smaller. The Anker lacks volume buttons on the speaker and this one might pump a bit more at max volume, but the Anker separates highs and instruments better, really good sound for $15.99. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0714HYYY3/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",3,1,2018-8-8,1,0,0
"I use this to play music in my backyard when I'm in the pool. I can put this little guy on my deck and still hear it across my backyard without having to turn it up all the way. The quality is very good. A lot of speakers get a fuzzy sound that makes the music sound less clear when you turn them up loud, but thus speaker doesn't do that. The quality remains very clear even at the highest volume.",5,1,2018-8-19,1,1,0
"*WAS* a decent little speaker for puttering around the house with- for a while- but not loud enough for outdoor use, a party, or in your car. In hindsight, I should have got the bigger one. But still good quality sound for its size and price. Unfortunately the charging port on mine broke on the inside after only 6 months. (I didn't use or charge it daily or excessively. Never dropped it, etc. Just normal use.) I'm well outside the return/exchange period so I'm S.O.L. on that purchase. Disappointed.",2,1,2018-5-15,1,0,0

"What more can I ask?  I have 2 speakers that pair up immediately (no problems at all).  The ""primary"" speaker pairs with Alexa very quickly and then I turn on the 2nd speaker and we are good to go.  Same results when pairing with my iPhone.  The sound fills up my back yard with rich stereo sound.  Battery life is great. I have used them for the past few months and they usually last for the entire afternoon into the evening. I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"I have owned this device for 4+ years. It is worth every single penny you put into it. For 4 years I have dropped it, drowned it, let it sit, work with it, play it and it has gone everywhere with me. It has been through 3 different relationships and still keeps tooting today. I have moved across the state with this thing and my god, it was seen so much with me. Buy it, it's worth it. 100%.",5,1,2019-7-16,1,1,0
"I like that this is so small and I can carry it around the house and place it wherever.Unfortunately, the sound is pretty bad, not much better than just listening to music on my phone without a speaker.

"I have had this speaker for 4 years. It is convenient to take with us when traveling. I use it in my office or when working from home. It fits snug in my phone holder that I also got on Amazon which is awesome. I like that is has a microphone so I can take phone calls on it. My husband had 3 bluetooth speakers already, but he bought one for himself because he likes mine so much. High quality and great for the price.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
Well I received this speaker a day late from the guaranteed arrival data I was excited to plug and play. However when it came on it sounded like I was playing my phone or my echo dot with the adapter cord through a tin can! Absolutely no bass like they claim! I would like a full refund including shipping and sales tax. Do not waste your money on this product.,1,1,2018-11-29,1,1,0
"Just to say,, this is an excellent product!  The battery lasts nearly forever it seems,, take it all over the house, garage, hot tub,,,  and I only charge it because I ""just know"" it has to run out!  I would guess at least 8-11 hour run time.  Volume is plenty high for me, quality of sound is excellent for it's intended purpose.  I recommend this one highly especially for the very low cost/quality ratio.",5,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0
I only have had to charge this three times in one year of having it using it almost everyday. The battery never dies and ill have it on for hours at a time. You can turn it up almost endlessly it seems. I can always hear my music in the shower now having it and its still in perfect condition having it for so long. Very worth the purchase,5,1,2020-3-22,1,1,0
"* UPDATE * OontZ reached out and sent us a replacement.  Haven't had any issues with the replacment.Didn't even make it 6 months.  Just sat on a shelf, never dropped it, never abused it in any way, and then it just stopped working for no good reason.  I do not recommend buying any product with a 90 day warranty.  Tells you something about the build quality and that the compay does not trust its own products to stand behind them for 1 year.  Pathetic.",5,1,2017-9-16,1,1,0
Just received this in the mail. I purchased this for work to Carry in my bags while on duty as a paramedic. When we have downtime sometimes we listen to music and podcast at the base. Our old one wasn’t playing loud enough so we searched for a new one. I was a little surprised at the small size. The size will fit easily in my backpack. It’s a micro usb charging port which makes it easy to find a charger. Despite its size this thing is LOUD. Very clear and sounds great! We will have our station rocking now!,5,1,2018-4-24,1,0,0
For its size and price the sound is absolutely killer.  Bluetooth locks on quickly the controls work perfectly and it’s nice looking.  I would bet you would have to pay considerably more to get better sound and bass.  The fact that you can sync this with another Oontz 3 is just icing.  I didn’t dunk it in a bucket of water so I’ll take Cambridge and it’s word that it’s waterproof.,5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"We have tried to use this speaker in the waiting area of our small medical office. It is seated on a shelf less than 5 yards away from the desktop computer it is connected to. I usually connect the speaker when it is sitting less than 6 inches from the desktop and then move it to the waiting room. It regularly takes 5-10 minutes to correctly sync, and then struggles to stay synced throughout the day. When not properly synced, the sound is staticy (think a radio station) and the music slows down and cuts in and out. It sounds awful and makes me crazy. Other people have told me that they have not had that problem with this speaker so I wonder if we got a defective product. But no amount of disconnecting and reconnecting, restarting or other troubleshooting has helped. I spend way too much of my work time during the day trying to fix this speaker. I would not recommend this product.",2,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"Great buy. This little box has a lot of volume for such a little box. I played it for several hours just on the battery. Charger cord comes with, not the plug for electrical outlet.

"[UPDATED: The seller is sending me a one-time replacement, charging shipping only.] For the price, it was fine for me - I use it more for audiobooks and NPR, etc. than I do for music, but after 11 months, the charger port won't work - it must be broken inside somehow, because the cable that came with it will not go in, no matter which way I try, and neither will another similar cable. Seems a shame - fine yesterday, can't use today. At least it was cheap.",4,1,2018-9-26,1,0,0
"Perfect speaker for the shower. We love it!I added a small shelf with suction cups just below and to one side of the shower head in order to minimize the amount of water splashing on the speaker. It stays dry for the most part and is pretty much at ear level, so the sound is as good as it can be. I listen to talk radio via my smartphone and I can hear every word clearly. My wife uses it to listen to music and she loves it, too.",5,1,2017-1-31,1,0,0

"I would have given my life for this speaker.  It sounded great, was very portable, and connected to everything-----for 2 1/2 yrs.  Now it won't connect, won't play (or if it does , it only lasts 60 seconds).  It was not abused or put in water. My children don't use it. I expect a speaker to last longer than 2 years!!!! I have told my friends about them and they have purchased them.  BUT---get a very extended warranty.  Or choose another brand.  For 2 years, I was in heaven. But the devil is in the details.

"The speaker sounded excellent initially, but after 6 months it has developed a low buzzing noise when connected to my phone or computer via bluetooth. It still works, but the constant low hum is audible enough to be frustrating when it's sitting on my office desk a few feet away.The speaker was never dropped or submerged in water, so I was really hoping for better durability from the speaker. The company's customer service offered to send a new one for a replacement fee of $9.99, but that's too rich for a defect that shows up in the first year on a little gadget like this.",1,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"This speaker is sturdy, power lasts for a really long time (not sure how long - haven't run it all of the way down ever), charges quickly, connects quickly and without you doing a darned thing and sounds AMAZING.

I like to listen to audio books and music through my phone, This speaker is small but puts out a good quality sound for both music and books.  It has rubber strips on bottom that keep it from sliding on a flat surface.  I use it in the house and my car.  Seems to have a good range of distance before it will disconnect.  I've had phone charging in my kitchen and listen to speaker in another room that is approximately 17 yards away.  It also has good volume.  I had wanted something a little cheaper, but now glad I paid more and got the quality I wanted.  Very pleased with my purchase",5,1,2016-9-10,1,0,0
I've only had this for a few days. Connected easily to my phone and Mac computer (via bluetooth).  I couldn't connect to my Vizio Sound Bar.

For the price it a good choice as long as you have realistic expectations.,4,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0

I wasn't expecting much but for $25 I thought give it a shot. I am blown away on every aspect. I can't get over how good it sounds from something so small.

Definitely worth 25$!,5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"It’s a great speaker and I’ve had it for almost a year (purchased last August). I used it everywhere — beach, park, shower, etc. However, recently the charger port broke and I’ve been unable to charge it so I can’t use it anymore. I wonder does anyone else have this problem? I don’t know if it’s because I was inserting the cord incorrectly, but I never had a problem until recently. I really recommend this speaker otherwise! It’s great for the shower because of the grip and water resistant feature.",4,1,2020-5-22,1,1,0
"It’s not too loud but the sound quality is good. Connects very quickly to my devices. I like that it’s weather resistant too. Small, compact and lightweight.

This is nice for filling a small room with a moderate sound level.",5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"As of yet, there's no way to get BOOMING bass out of a small speaker, it's just simple physics. So don't expect to ""feel it"". You can hear more lows than a lot of speakers that you might be used to listening to and its pleasantly surprising. Just be reasonable with your expectations. That said, it's a great product! It's very well designed and can be quite loud without being harsh or tinny. It's very portable but not as much as its sister, the Curve, which is equal in quality. It has less potentially annoying light features than the Curve, which some might appreciate. Easily and quickly rechargeable via USB.",5,1,2016-9-3,1,1,0

I never write reviews but this has been the most annoying speaker.",1,1,2019-6-29,1,2,0
"Initial impression is 5 stars.  Bluetooth connects instantly, solid feel of build and impressive sound. This speaker is about the size of a soda can. I sampled songs from Adelle, Led Zeppelin, Pat Benatar, 36 Crazy Fists and Metallica amongst other various artists. Vocals are very clear, mids are surprisingly rich and bass is enough. EQ settings from Google Play transferred well to the speaker. I purchased as a personal device at the beach but it reaches undistorted volume enjoyable for a group in the yard or while vacuuming the house. Hopefully it holds up to use over the years.",5,1,2017-7-15,1,0,0
"Good sound and features. I especially like the volume buttons on the unit which are easier to adjust than on the iPod touch or one of my tablets. Once charged the unit will play all day without fail; so battery life is outstanding. Bluetooth connection is quite good out to thirty plus feet away in the garage, so no complaints there.My only criticism is that the power button is too small, somewhat recessed and not easily used. Plus the cover on it is black and the small symbol on the button also blends in too well with the unit. They must be aware of this since there is a small sticker next to and pointing to the button. My fix -- a small dab of yellow nail polish on the button. Problem solved!",5,1,2016-7-22,1,0,0
I bought what I thought was going to be a cheap throw away speaker for my construction job.  I was impressed with sound quality right away. Second I know it’s not advertised as water resistant but it’s been splashed and left in pouring rain a lot. Battery will last a few days at work no problem . You can charge it while playing music. But oddly it has to powered on and playing first. It’s now a year old still like new. But out of the box the power button was very tricky to use had to press it at just right.,5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"This speaker is worth it! I bought this months ago and have maybe charged it a maximum of 4 times and I listen to it for at least 16-20+ hours/week.

I've even taken it to volleyball practice and we used it as our workout background music! It's so nice for traveling as well! I love how I can just grab it and put it into any bag and take it with me. But nothing seriously beats the battery on this speaker.

Once you have connected to the speaker once it will automatically connect when you turn your Bluetooth on. You know that you're connecting to it because it makes a little chirp sound when it is successful. We haven't tested if it's waterproof or not. For being so small it can be really loud. We placed it on the coffee table and I could even feel it vibrating the table. The sound is really clear and it has rubber on the sides of it so it will stay where even you place it. We use it to bring to parties so people can connect to it and play music from their phones whether it be YouTube, Spotify, or whatever it works with all of it. We love this speaker!",5,1,2016-7-10,1,0,0
We purchased for outside by the pool. It works great. Sound is amazing and often have to turn it down.  Bluetooth is easy to connect and usually stays connected. Only a few times we were a little too far away and it stopped playing music.

After I got this one, I was so happy that it didn't have the inconveniences my old one did. But the sound quality is just absolutely terrible. It has no bass, everything sounds sharp and like it's stabbing your ear drums. And the worst of it: there's a constant buzzing sound behind your music. It cuts out in between songs, which makes it that much more noticeable and irritating. I really don't know what people are talking about when they say this speaker has great sound quality. I will most definitely be going back to my DOSS speaker.",1,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0

I mean, you’re not throwing any block parties, but I have a decent size apt and it definitely fills the space. The bass is not super powerful but definitely more present than you’ll probably expect. The mids are clear at every volume and the highs are crisp without being tinny much at all. Altogether, the Oontz Angle 3 has a sound you will enjoy very much at a price anyone can enjoy. As far as the build, it feels sturdy in the hand so I don’t feel so anxious about knocking it around. YET! I’ve only had it for 3 days now so we’ll see how it holds up in my trusty dusty backpack. I recommend getting a case for it though. The flap covering the charging and auxiliary ports can be a bit of a nuisance to get to so be mindful of that but it’s hardly a hinderance.I’m extremely happy with this speaker and company so far. Next I’m going for the angle 3 ultra. I can only imagine what that thing has to offer.",5,1,2018-2-8,1,0,0
"I've had this speaker for a few days now, it charges fairly quick and lasts for hours. It has crystal clear sound and can actually get pretty loud if you want it too, it's highly portable and light-weight. I can't attest to the water-resistance of the product because I'm not fond of bringing any electronics near water. I think this was definitely worth the price, considering i saw smaller speakers elsewhere for a lot more, I'm pleased with it. I've heard stories of speakers going dead after one use or after a few weeks, this has yet to be the case for me so far and I hope it stays that way. It worked fine on my android LG tracfone.",5,1,2017-2-16,1,0,0
"This is a very nice speaker. I upgraded from a 5 year old Bluetooth speaker, and this one is light years ahead of that one. Receives a signal from clear across the house. In fact if I go out to the garage, 3 rooms away plus closed doors, it continues to play. I also like the fact that I can see the battery power remaining in the speaker by looking at my phone. Very nice. Highly recommend.",5,1,2019-4-13,1,0,0
Sound is great. It does not sound like a small speaker. I used to be an audio video salesman at Frys and this sounds like the $300 Bose Bluetooth speakers we used to sell. It is not as directional as my tower speakers which means it fills the whole room with sound. I can hear the music throughout my whole apartment which is awesome when I’m moving around. It has base but to overwhelming where it will disturb my neighbors. Wish I bought this a long time ago.,5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"I got this during Amazon Prime Day Deals as an impulse buy.  I had never had a speaker like this but wanted one that's water resistant so that I could play it outside when I coach high schoolers and not worry about it being damp out.  Great sound quality.  Durable.  I've actually used it mostly in my home (kitchen) because it's small, a neutral design, and great quality.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"Update 3/16/2019: I discovered that the real problem is a faulty USB port on the speaker, which seems to be a common complaint for this model. If I push up on the USB plug and then wrap the cable around the speaker to hold it in place, I can get it to charge again, but I don't know how long this solution will last--it can't be good for the longevity of the cable.Previous Review:",3,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0
"I got this for my daughter for Christmas, and didn't know what to expect from this relatively small speaker.  My daughter loves it though.

"Been using this all day for weeks while I do home improvements. A charge lasts a LONG time. Probably only need to charge every other day after all day use. Good loud, clear sound.

"I don’t do reviews…I had my doubts but I went for it. Wow! The Angle3 delivers BIG! Excellent sound in a cool little package. I’ve nicknamed it my Tiny Terror. I’ve paired it effortlessly to both my Echo and my iPhone (separately) in seconds. The pairing instructions were straightforward and worked as described. Here’s the kicker - I recently took the Angle3 on a vacation. The speaker found its home on a handrail on the deck of the cabin I rented and played tunes constantly.  One evening as I walked past it my arm brushed against it…as it went airborn I reached frantically to catch it. I watched as it dropped in slow motion 15 feet to the Ozark mountain granite slab beneath the deck of the cabin. I expected to watch it shatter in a million bits. Instead, at impact it bounced one time and came to rest intact…and continued playing. No worse for wear it continues to perform flawlessly. I’m placing another order for another in the next day or two. Tiny Terror indeed!",5,1,2018-6-2,1,0,0
"What a great little speaker!I have a few teenagers and a few younger kids in the house and over the last month they have really put this speaker to the test and I has held its own. The sound quality is great when used in the house and out in the yard. I know for sure it has been dropped several times and the only damage has been a little scratch on the metal screen where it hit on a rock. Yes I said a rock and it still works great, no worse for the wear.",5,1,2017-5-18,1,1,0
"Worked nicely for exactly 24 days, today stopped working, does not turn on, I guess you get what you pay for, never again, pay a little more and buy brand, there iui s a reason is brand ..this one crapI wasted my money, broke a week after the chance to send it back had expired..",1,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
Mine was great when I first purchased it ! Now a few months later ... it has a noticeable rattle ! I never had it up that loud ... certainly never at full volume . It seems as though the front metal grill that protects the speaker is just loose . Unfortunately there is no way to tighten it !As far as sound goes : It is clear and crisp . No real Bass to speak of ... but didnt expect much in a speaker this small and light . On that note it is Very Very light . On one hand that nice for travel ... on the other ... there definitely arent any Big magnets on these speakers with it being this light .Which explains the lack of Bass .,2,1,2016-3-8,1,0,0
"Small sound and very little bass honestly. I returned it and bought the Bose Soundlink color 2 and it sounds soo much better (but costs 4x the price).If you can afford it and sound is important to you, spend the extra and get the Soundlink.",3,1,2016-12-2,1,2,0
"I have yet to personally test it in the elements, but I have now bought 3 & they are incredible. Bought the first one for the girlfriend who regularly used it to replace her cruddy car stereo and would often leave it locked in there where the heat definitely got intensely well as to Bonnaroo music festival where it got rained on, still works like new great! I also bought one for a friend in AZ who takes it hiking, & everywhere with her & she loves it. Finally bought one for my home/bathroom use & so far I’m beyond satisfied. Battery life is great! Sound is as good as my expensive skull candy noise cancelling headphones. Only issue I’ve had is that there is very little control for the bass boost, and although it’s not obnoxiously bass-y like Beats by Dre, it will fall off a shelf if turned up all the way & sitting near the edge of you know what I mean. But overall a surprisingly great speaker, was not disappointed especially with how cheap it is.",5,1,2018-8-21,1,0,0
"I'm so disappointed I just got these in May. I had the 1st gen for years until I wanted to get an upgrade. So unfortunate, these only lasted three months. They blew out on me. I never dropped it, the exterior is fine, there is no visible damage. It just.. stopped working and sounds static-y. Looks like I'm going to have to find another bluetooth speaker brand. Sucks because I praised these speakers for affordability and quality prior to this purchase. RIP.",1,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I've purchased an array of blue tooth speakers to listen to books through as I drive in my truck.  6 of the earlier ones did not provide enough volume to hear the books and were hopeless when it came to phone calls.  My JBL Charge 2 and this little guy are great for my book listening.For some reason I don't know, bluetooth for phone is lower volume than bluetooth for music or voice media.  There's a noticeable drop in volume when a call comes in.  Even at maximum volume neither the OontZ Angle 3 nor the JBL Charge 2 are loud enough to hear unless held to my head.  This clearly defeats the purpose of ""hands free"".",4,1,2017-1-28,1,0,0
"It's a small but good-performing unit.  I've no complaints with the battery life as we have never yet found the limits of time before we recharge.  It produces pretty good sound and decent volume considering its small size.  Its exterior is rubberized for non slip and splash-resistance, so very safe for outdoors.  I have had no issues with bluetooth connections. and always pairs with my devices.  A fine device for a good price.",5,1,2018-11-23,1,0,0

"This was a present for someone but recently I used it for a week. I like the sound signature but if I had to do it again I'd get the bigger one to get a bit more bass. But I had a tight budget for this as a gift. But what bass is there sounds good, much better than other low price BT speakers that try to pump up their bass too much.5 stars for the value.

"This speaker has to be one of the best Bluetooth speakers I have ever had.  I do not have to turn the volume up to maximum because the speaker is very loud.

I've connected it to my android phone and it does connect and play music but it shows up in the Bluetooth cue as an Oontz and not an Oontz 3.

Bought one of these for my 92 year old mother who wanted a little transistor radio (!) for her patio for when she's out there reading or gardening.

Just unboxed this speaker and wow it surpassed my expectations. I have tried out many speakers and I was reluctant to try this one not being ue or jbl or something along those lines.

"I've played with a few of these and this one is the hands down winner & you can't beat the price. Yes, it is can play very loud and actually sounds good. The main purpose for my purchase is for hands free phone use while in the kitchen. The human voice quality plus the mic pickup is excellent. It has an auto shutoff which is one less thing to worry about. I should have known Cambrige put their name on this since my dad has had one of their big boy systems as his real home theater for 15 years. And it blows you away. Im buying another Oontz Angle for my bathroom to enjoy longer showers.",5,1,2016-10-15,1,1,0
"The bluetooth connection works great on the laptop and the Android Note 8. Nice sound and it's loud. I can hear it clearly upstairs when it's playing in the kitchen downstairs.

"Sound is very impressive at this price point. I purchased the orange unit and I like the look, fitting on the shelf at home without drawing much attention to it.  The Bluetooth works well, living on a 2.6 acre ranch, and I can hear the music clearly across my property. The Bluetooth will drop off if I have my phone on me at about 100 yards.  Overall, highly recommended - consistent with the other reviewers.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0

"Great speaker! Setup was as easy as (1) turning on the speaker, (2) turning on bluetooth on your device, (3) selecting OontZ Angle and (4) listening for the chime sound from the speaker to confirm pairing. I use it for Spotify and Netflix / Amazon Prime streaming. Way better than the flat sound from ipads and iphones.The battery life is pretty good too. Can probably last for 2 solid days of playing before it needs a charge again. Charges via USB.

"This is an awesome, portable product with good sound and great power.  I bought one for home because I was dissatisfied with mini speakers that I had to plug in to my Itouch.  I took it on vacation and use it around the house.  I love it, so much that I bought a second one to keep in my bag to use when I lecture on a local college campus.  I occasionally have to use one in a large lecture hall, and the students in the back row have no problem with hearing it.  It is a rather sturdy product too.  The only trouble I have had was with two devices look for it at the same time.  But, it was my confusion with dealing with bluetooth, so if you are already a wireless expert, you will be fine.  The darn thing never seems to run out of power either!  Highly recommend.",5,1,2016-3-7,1,0,0
"I love it. Bought it for my dorm and it’s so loud when I have the volume all the way up, the whole hallway can hear my music, word for word. The radio in my car recently stopped working and this is a perfect substitute. You can hear the music over the wind and cars flying past you on the highway. The shape is perfect for having on a desk, in the shower, or in your car. It’s really easy to disconnect and connect other devices. The only thing I don’t like is that it doesn’t announce it’s going to die, I’ve had cheap $10 speakers from Walmart that verbally told me when it would die, but considering the battery life can last me a week it’s fine.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0

The battery life is really good. I can go ~3 days of average use before having to recharge it. Some complaints that I've heard is that you don't know how charged the speaker is/there is no indicator for it. That is only true for some users. If you have an apple device and are connected via Bluetooth, the battery life comes up in the top right of the phone. Android users don't have the same luxury.

Was thinking about buying a more expensive speaker but since I don't really use it that much I could not justify spending a large amount of money.  Glad I bought this product.  Would love to review more Cambidge SounWorks items!  The highs, lows, and mids are crisp and clear.  The bass is perfect and not too much or too little.  Really does great on music of all genres.  The only downside I can see is the speaker phone does not pick up your voice well.  You have to be pretty close to the speaker for the person on the other end to hear you.  They come through crisp and clear through the speaker, just not the other way around.",5,1,2016-9-8,1,0,0

Of course this thing is not going to have bass you can feel or sound that will knock the socks off of you.

Syncing was easy for both Android and iOS.I had the original OontZ Angle a few years ago.  I had to replace it because the charging port developed a problem, though the speaker does still work if you can manage to position the cord correctly for charging.  First off, this model has a rubber flap covering the charging port when it's not in use, so it appears that they solved the only problem I had with the old model!  Most of the buttons have moved from the back to the side of the unit.  Probably the best change for me is that this model includes auto-shutoff.

"I purchased this on sale for $19.99 USD after being quite impressed by its predecessor, the Oontz Angle 2 Plus. The speaker quality in the unit I received was on-par or better than the Angle Plus, and Bluetooth seemed to work perfectly. Unfortunately, the same can not be said for it's build quality. I will be sending my unit back as, when it arrived, the faceplate had come loose in the packaging and slightly deformed. Overall, the Angle 3 does not feel as ""sturdy and indestructible"" as the 2 by quite a ways. The rubber on the ends has a slick, cheap feel as well. If you're planning on picking one of these up, unless you really need a slightly louder speaker (knowing that the Plus is plenty loud), you should go for the Angle Plus instead. That is not to say that this is a bad speaker by any means, the previous edition is just the better unit in my opinion.",3,1,2015-11-13,1,1,0

I will tell you this little speaker, is not a Bose quality speaker but for the size and price you cannot beat it. It is EXTREMELY loud if you put it on full volume. I use this speaker with my laptop to amplify lectures that have been recorded from class and to listen to music when paired with my iPhone. I have listened to lectures in my car on the highway going 70 mph and could still hear what was being said. I had it completely turned up but I could still understand what was being said. I have noticed that with some songs that I play on it, if you turn the volume up too much the sound does become distorted. I also have tried the call feature on this speaker. The person on the other end sounds like they have a huge echo. This is not what I bought this device for so it hasn't bothered me. The bass on this speaker is great.

The best bluetooth speaker I have ever had.  Sound is crystal clear and bass is not disturbing but just right.  But the speaker's tone is default at a little too high on treble.  All your smartphone(s) or any EQ apps can control this treble down to your taste.  Once you do that this is the da bomb!!I was awed by how loud and clear by this speaker and fills the whole living room (I have about 1500 sq. ft. size)!!  Thanks Cambridge Soundworks for making a great quality product!!  Two thumbs up!!,5,1,2017-3-11,1,2,0
This little speaker (actually smaller than I had envisioned) has impressive bass and a clear smooth sound that belies its stature. We sync it to our phone and I learned how nice the range was when my husband walked off with his synced phone in his pocket - really nice.A small thing - but I like the clear on/off click and button feel as well. no guessing as to whether it is off or still on.,5,1,2019-2-12,1,0,0
"I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! I bought this speaker some months ago and I LOVE IT! So does everyone else!! The volume is great and can play very loud. It's a nice size & shape, and comes with a charger too. If the battery dies, just plug it in and you can STILL use it while its charging. It's easy to connect to devices under ""OontZ Angle"" (at least that's what it is for me). DEFINITELY Recommend and WOULD BUY AGAINThe bass and treble playback & levels are very good as well ^_^",5,1,2018-1-25,1,0,0
"I expected better from a Cambridge Soundworks product. I like the look & size, but as other reviewers have said the sound disappoints. It is very tinny with hardly any low tones coming through despite my adjusting the input as much as possible. I have an older Skull Candy 2xl that blows this one away as far as sound quality goes.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I keep this in my office and connect it to my Macbook and listen to music while working. If I walk away and come back and my laptop went to sleep, when I wake it back up and start playing music then hit the power button on the OontZ to connect bluetooth, everytime the sound is jacked up. It is distorted and crackles. See attached video. I have to disconnect then reconnect and it will work fine after that.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
This little speaker sounds decent but you sure can't get much volume out of it. It would work nicely if you used it at your work desk where you heard it more than anyone around you. I bought it to use in a company car but it just didn't have enough volume over the noise from the engine and tires.,3,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I am very happy with this speaker. It took me forever to pick one out, there are just so many, and it is so hard to figure out what kind of quality they are, and how the sound will be. I actually spent a little time googling about the best bluetooth speakers, and quite a few sites mentioned this as one of the best sounding speakers for the price. I was not disappointed at all. It's actually smaller than I thought it would be, but that works out fine, it doesn't take up much room! The volume is great, it's not super loud like a stereo, but it's perfect for playing in my living room! The sound is clear and crisp. I would absolutely recommend this product!",5,1,2016-8-30,1,1,0
"I'm a music person and listen to music ALL the time.  I hesitated to order this because it seemed expensive and I have too many times learned the hard way that you get what you pay for.  On that note, this product is absolutely the bomb!  The sound quality is unbelievable and it was super easy to pair to my iphone X.  In fact, I am ordering another today to leave at work - and plan to order more for gifts as well.  I can't say enough about this little speaker - you won't be disappointed if you order one!",5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"Found tis Online on a Special Low Price. So I purchased it. I connect to Charge it And setup Bluetooth, EASY,.I tried streaming Music Clear and High Volume better than the Big Live speaker I got a few years ago. When a Call came in I connected the speaker Clear Sound Quality the Person on the other End Never Said Can Not Understand you. I still Have to Try it to see if the 100 Ft Range does Work. The Big Blue was only 30,. Im just Satisfied of the Features and Sound Clarity",5,1,2018-10-15,1,0,0
"Actually, I was hesitant to purchase this bluetooth speaker because it was so little money, but I was looking for something to use in my truck and thought I'd give it a try.  It was an Amazon top choice and the reviews were many and good. It  sounds great and it has little rubber pads to help keep it in place. It did slide some on my dash so now it's on the console. My husband is a musician and very snobby about sound and he was impressed when we tried it out in the house. It passed a tough test with him:)",5,1,2018-8-21,1,0,0

"Very easy to pair. Good battery life. And the sound is much better than what you'd expect for a speaker of this size.

Came with a charger and aux cord to use on items that do not support Bluetooth.The only thing I was really unhappy about is the charging cable..... it's the shortest cord I have ever seen in my life! Luckily I found another charger of the same size which I use now to charge this.",5,1,2017-4-13,1,2,0
"The speaker is not bad.  The batteries are not bad.  There is one feature however, that to me, tells me that compared to an Anker speaker, i would not buy this speaker again.With the Anker speakers, at least the models I have had, they will re-connect if you walk away.  Say for example I am at my desk connected, walk away for a bit and then come back.  With an Oontz, I have to typically turn the speaker back on (it has not been that long), then bring up my phone's BT and re-connect.  I find with the Ankers auto-reconnect feature I do not have to go through this every time.",2,1,2016-12-6,1,1,0
"Bought this for my husband around Valentines. We have used it all over the house and outside. The only issue, if my phone is synced to it, his won’t sync. The speaker remembers which phone it’s synced with even after turning it off. You have to un-sync with the other phone before you can use with a different phone. But we love it!!!",5,1,2018-7-25,1,1,0
"All this talk about ""bass""... There is none.  It is a small speaker and sounds like one.  Like desktop speakers from 15 years ago without the sub woofer.  Slightly better than your average laptop in terms of sound quality.  It is no where near as good sounding as the Bose SoundLink Bluetooth speaker priced at about $100 more.  I bought it hoping it would at least come close to the sound from one of those...  Nah...  I don't listen to it that often because it doesn't sound as good as I'd hoped, based on all of the positive feedback.  I should have gone looking for a frequency response curve somewhere.That said, if you understand what you are getting, it works well, sounds okay, is loud, is easy to connect to, is cheap, and is really compact.  I'm going to give it to my kids (<10 years old).  They'll enjoy it.",3,1,2018-2-12,1,0,0
"Love the big sound it delivers, is water resistant for use in wet environments, and has to good battery life.

It is possible to have anything be defective.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Sound is really clear and it has more volume than I expected. I was wondering what was wrong with it because of the discounted price but it has exceeded any expectations I had. I've purchased Cambridge speakers before and as always they just sound good. Good bass (not room rocking of course) and it pairs with my phone and laptop seamlessly. Great purchase.  I haven't tested the battery life but I will usually listen between 2 and 3 hours with no problem. Save yourself Bose, Sony or JBL money and get one/two of these instead. Owned one month now. I also haven't water tested this and don't plan to...",4,1,2016-9-30,1,1,0

"I wanted a cheap ""disposable"" speaker for the beach with a decent battery. And this it. Had it for 2 full summers. Battery outlasts my phones battery. Waterproof. Sand proof. Always gets wet, buried in sand tossed around. Even ran it over with my truck. Bad habit of setting it on top of my tire. Thing won't die. Loud enough, but lacking some bass. For the price, it is an amazing product.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
"For Christmas, I received a radio with bluetooth output. I bought the Oontz speaker to give me some portability. Instructions for both devices assume that the other has some means for choosing a connection or putting in a password. Neither one does.  It won't connect.",1,1,2019-1-30,1,1,0
"We received our OontZ Angle portable speaker for Christmas and loved it.  Unfortunately, the speaker only worked for 2 months.  It was never damaged and was taken care of well.  Every time we try to use it, it cuts in and out and has a bunch of static.  You can not even hear the music. It is not a matter of distance or interference with other phones.  We have tried every solution to attempt to get the speaker to work again and nothing has been effective. We must have received a defective product, but the company says it is out of the return window and will not give us a refund or replace the product.  We would just like a product that works.  Initially we were really impressed with the product. It has a loud volume, can be taken everywhere, is durable, and connected easily to our phones.  We'd happily send the product back for a new one if that would be permitted.",1,1,2016-3-31,1,2,0
"I bought this speaker mainly to listen to ebooks by the pool.  I was very happy with the sound quality.

I was able to connect my pixel phone in less than 2 minutes.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,1,0
"I have been using this speaker for four months now and love the sound and battery life. It is compact and portable so I can take it around the house, the outside deck, or out to the garage and it sounds fantastic.  It also works well with my computer, improving the sound, when watching a movie or playing music.  I highly recommend this speaker and would definitely buy it again.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"I wanted a speaker that could hold deep bass tones, but also play rock n' roll. I wanted a speaker that could play loud enough to hear regardless of surrounding noise such as at the beach. I wanted a speaker that did not distort when played louder. This speaker accomplishes all these things! I first bought a Braven after hearing it's sample song at Target...it played loud and bass-y (sp?), but once I received this speaker I was very dissapointed. It distorted the bass tones to a ""dink, dink"" sound rather then keeping with those nice deep tones. It also played loud but only in one direction. This was not for me! On to a search again. At this point I began to be obsessed with researching reviews. I had recently heard someone playing music in line at an amusement park, that played loud and bass-y, theirs was awesome...UE and was small and black. Now don't confuse the UE mini boom, that was my first ""rush to the store speaker purchase"". This was not the one. The UE miniboom is only okay. To this day I am not sure which one that guy in line had. Anyways, After more reviews, I purchased the JBL Flip 3 Waterproof. This looks pretty! But again, it was not what I was looking for. The bass was better then the Braven, but still didn't hold those deep tones that I was looking for. It played loud but not as loud as I felt like it could for paying $150. I did like that it was waterproof, although I have no plans to put my speaker in or near water. Considering price, and knowing I wasn't getting what was important to me out of a speaker, I returned it. Then the research that kills your brain began! OBSESSED. Everything that sounded like I would get what I wanted was in the $299 price range. I do not have this kind of budget. I wanted to spend no more then $150. As I was researching reviews, I happened to stumble upon the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3. I saw that it had over 8,000 reviews and maintained a 4.5 star. This intrigued me. I mean, it only cost $28, maybe reviewers weren't looking for what I was. So I began reading through review after review. I was beginning to be convinced...especially at a low cost risk. I decided to purchase. And to my surprise, I freaking love this speaker! It has by far been the best speaker not only that I have purchased, but have listened to samples at all the local stores. It plays loud! It plays clear! It maintains those deep bass tones! It may not by earth shaking, but it does not distort the sound! I love it!! I took it outside yesterday (btw, it is small, light, and has a nice grip on underside...case is nice too) my friend synced with her phone (syncs quickly too) and she chose which ever music she wanted to play, and all of our friends were impressed with the sound quality at such an affordable price! Forget those overpriced speakers...this one works for me! Search is over :)",5,1,2016-10-10,1,1,0
I have been using it for a couple of weeks when I go to the pool.  The bluetooth paired easily with my Samsung phone and later with my Ipad mini.

"Let me start by mentioning that I was a teenager in the 1990's, when woofers were a minimum of 8"" and everyone had a bass system in their car. I'm also a trained audio engineer so I'm pretty picky when it comes to sound.I should have read the specs on this more closely, because when I unpacked it from the box I was shocked at how tiny it is. It's the size of a small cell phone. I was expecting something more like a small boombox, maybe 12"" wide. This thing sounds like it looks. It can be pretty loud, being made entirely of tweeters, and the sound is pleasantly clear, but there is no low end whatsoever. The bottom frequencies stop at a low-midrange (I'd guess maybe like 180-200 hz).",3,1,2017-9-14,1,1,0
"The sound quality is great. However, it's cutting in and out so much I can't stand it. It keeps going silent and then fixing itself, even though the light is solid blue.

"I've been wanting one of these for a while. I looked at high end stuff, claiming to appeal to audiophiles. Audiophiles don't use Bluetooth. This is light and small, well designed and sounds pretty good. It fits in my backpack and doesn't weigh much. I can hear the high notes, mid range and even the bass. Excellent speaker for 28 bucks. It sounds a little better and both the phone and the speaker's battery last longer if you use the included 3.5 mm cord.The OontZ Angle 4 should have a bigger battery and a protruding 3.5 mm male jack, so a wired connection can be established without sacrificing water resistance.",5,1,2016-3-3,1,1,0

Great product. I deliver mail on the weekends. i was planning on replacing the stock radio with somthing that has bluetooth or an Aux cable so i could listen to my podcasts when delivering mail.  but wasnt looking forward to tearing my whole dash apart. Then i found this. this thing works great. i drive with my window open all day and can still hear what Joe Rogan is talking about on his podcasts. battery life is good too. im driving for 6 hours most days and i havent had it die on me yet. connects great to my phone via bluetooth with no problem. i drive on gravel roads most of the day too so it gerts really dirty. its basically sealed shut with rubber so no issues there.

I don't usually give reviews because I don't want to take the time to write out anything, but I have to say this speaker really does a great job for me. I am using it for my Ipad and I can't say enough nice things about it. I'm not a techie so I wish I could give you all the technical reasons that it's good, but I can say, I just like the way it sounds and it works great for me and it's easy to charge and easy to use and that's what I was looking for.

This product has a main defect that I was shocked to know how wide spread it was: the speaker after a while it loose the capability to charge meaning you can charge for a whole day only to realise that it's not charging.

I love this item is definitely a boost 2 sound and the quality is really good as well along with the fact that it is not easily broken and the battery life I have leaving it off the charger and it is been planned the next day as I woke up the only problem I do have is that it is so small that is easily lose but that does have its pluses as well all in all I believe this is a goodbye and I thank my wife 4 buying this 4 me,5,1,2019-2-3,1,0,0
"Totally worth the money! Great sound, quick bluetooth connectivity, and wonderful battery life. Not to mention it is versatile in the sense that if you DO have trouble with bluetooth, there’s an option for an auxiliary cord! It isn’t the loudest speaker I’ve heard, but it definitely isn’t the softest either - I’d say it’s a perfect medium. The sound payoff is very impressive for the price. I love that you can lie the speaker vertically or horizontally and still get the same effect. My only complaint is that the charger only comes with a wire - you have to buy an adapter for it. Overall, I am in love with this speaker, and I don’t regret buying it in the slightest. Definitely saved myself $50+ for the same amount of quality!!!",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"Great little speaker! I'm a music addict so this is perfect for the shower..or doing yard work. Bass is great and I can adjust the bass on my phone to sound even better..but then of course it wont last quite as long lol.. I may be 50, but I like my music LOUD and theres always gotta be a good beat (sometimes it even annoys my adult age kids lol oh well!) Speaking of which,  this is small enough that I can hide it from them in my pocketbook so they cant ""borrow"" (aka steal) it! 😉😁",5,1,2018-10-28,1,0,0
"Excellent buy! I have purchased numerous Bluetooth speakers for my cell phone and none of them compared to this one. The bass isn't as solid or deep as I would like but the clarity of the audio is amazing and the bass is by far better than any of the others so far. I am also very impressed with the battery time! I started listening to my music around 11 p.m. and the speaker was still working until 9 a.m. the following morning when I realized that I had not shut it off as I drifted off to sleep. It was still working! Also, it immediately paired with my smartphone without a problem. I would strongly recommend buying this product.",5,1,2017-1-25,1,0,0
"I purchased three of these for gifts for three very different people. One uses it at home to listen to music while hanging out or cleaning, one uses it mainly outside with friends and while playing sports, the other likes loud music with lots of bass. They're all happy with this speaker. I can personally attest to the quality of the  loudness and bass-ness(?) of this speaker. And it's really not that big.",5,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
"This is a great little bluetooth or wired speaker.  My car doesn't have bluetooth capability so this is really handy for streaming music from my phone.  It also picks up with phone calls, which was a bonus.  Thanks!",5,1,2019-7-4,1,1,0
"I was very skeptical of this unit - thought the price had to be too low for it to be of quality.  I've only had it a couple weeks, so the jury is still out on how long it will last, but so far, I am extremely satisfied.  It's hard to believe such a big sound can come out of such a little speaker.  It can be moved anywhere in the house and I have my news and music right with me.  The sound isn't tinny or hard to listen to at loud decibels.  In fact, I was considering a Boze for the same purpose and I don't know that I can tell enough of a difference to make spending the other $350 necessary.  I will see how this one holds up over the next few weeks, and if it hangs in there, I'll buy another one.  Very impressed!!",5,1,2017-2-16,1,0,0
"To give you an idea of how small it is, I’ve held it in my hand and I am a girl that stands 5‘4“ tall. This little thing puts out great sound and is unbelievably portable. You could put it in your purse, it’s that small.  It took about five hours to charge (it was completely dead  although the instructions say it comes partially charged). I have not tested the capability of the battery yet but will update if needed.",5,1,2019-3-24,1,0,1
"I was fairly pleased with this speaker but in just a couple of weeks of not much use it now only delivers sound in a chopped up way which makes it useless.

"My wife loves this speaker unit.  She desk is in a space-challenged area where every square inch is at a premium, this speaker takes very little of that.  It has great tone and volume.  She only uses it with the power and audio cables, so can't comment on battery or bluetooth.  Appears to be very well made, totally believable that it would be a great mobile unit.  We've used many desktop speakers over the years, and this is definitely one of the best.  Recommended.",5,1,2018-6-16,1,0,0
This speaker is SUPER easy to connect. I connected it to my Apple and Android devices in a few seconds. The sound is GREAT for the price and size.

Most of these cheaper bluetooth speakers have under a 6 month lifespan...this speaker included. I read the reviews. Sound quality is decent nothing exceptional. Speaker is the size of my hand.

"Awesome sound quality and volume! If you are sitting on the fence because of mixed reviews, do not heed them! This is an amazing product for the money, it has very good quality pro logic internal speakers, and the subwoofer is great. I downloaded a bass booster app, and that really makes it crank out the bass. Don't expect UBL quality, but I've had lots of bluetooth speakers, and this one is very impressive for the low price! Buy it!",5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"This speaker produces excellent sound quality. If I play it on full volume, it sounds like I'm having a house party. For every day use, I have to keep the volume under 6, otherwise it's TOO loud, which is a good problem to have!It is small, but considering how powerful it is, the compact size is a plus... don't need a bulky speaker that takes up room.",5,1,2017-12-22,1,6,1

For the cheap price tag, you can't beat it.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,1,0
What a great little product. I had an UE Boom that I absolutely loved. Someone took right from under my nose and I had a dilemma. Spend $200 again on a speaker that I use here and there or research the heck out of the smaller lower priced speakers on Amazon. Well I watched a ton of video reviews and decided to go with the Ange 3. This thing JAMS! Almost as loud and clear as my UE Boom and $170 less. I'm sold. I suggest this for anyone looking for a small portable speaker with big sound.,5,1,2017-7-7,1,1,0
"I've had this bluetooth speaker since last July and it is wonderful!  Its so easy to connect to the source ..i.e. smartphone, computer, etc, that even I don't have any problem!  It has such better sound than the smart phone and I use it everyday while I work in my studio or  am in the rest of my house.  Then, at night, I use it with my smart phone for meditation and relaxing as I fall asleep.  I'm not a tech guru by any stretch, but I LOVE this speaker...and even know, now, what a bluetooth is!!!!",5,1,2018-4-8,1,0,0
"Simple and attractive external speaker for iPhone and iPad and other portable music devices. Easy to pair up with your phone. The sound is reasonable for something of this small size. I am never quite sure when the battery is going to go out, and the volume can be too soft to hear over road noise if used in a car. Flap for the charger port could have a cutout to make it easier to lift. Handy size/form to aim sound at a convenient angle.",4,1,2017-9-3,1,1,0
Sounds great for the size. I use this speaker in my tri-axle dump truck and I place it in the dash where it bounces and gets knocked around all day long without any issues. The battery lasts a long time. I usually charge it once every 3 days but keep in mind I use it all day long. I stored it for about 2 months without using and was surprised to find the battery still fully charged....amazing!,5,1,2018-1-8,1,1,0
"great little speaker for the price! perfect for the car (which is why I bought it) and works well for football (soccer) training when my kids and I just go out to kick about. louder than I expected so it works well outside and inside! connects easily to the phones (Spotify) and the sound quality is actually really good, a lot better than I expected!",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
I bought this such a long time ago and didn't even remotely expect it to last this long and work this well! Connects to bluetooth speedy quick. Sound quality is really good. It's really durable and water resistant. I've gotten it wet many times and have never had an issue. Battery life is okay. It needs a charge after a few hours of use on high volume but that's not an issue for me. Really happy with this little speaker. The only thing I'd change is the length of the charging cord. It's a shorty :),5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
Do not waste your time going from store to store to find a bluetooth speaker for the most reasonable price as I did. I have tried every speaker on the display floor out there and decided to wait and take my chances on the Cambridge SoundWorks. I am greatful that I waited. This little speaker packs so much power for its little size and the battery life is superb. Connects as soon as I turn on my gym television. I have had no need to play it at full volume because of its great performance at the mid-volume. Do yourself a favor and order this without hesitation. You will not regret it. If there are any bad reviews; it might be due to a defective device or someone with extremely high standards.**** It’s been over one year and I still standby my review above. People with high end products such as jawbone and Sony portable speakers have been curious about my little speaker because it’s affordable cost and great sound. ****,5,1,2016-9-20,1,2,0
"I bought this speaker because I wanted something compact with a lot of sound. Based on the other reviews I read it was durable and packed enough bass to get the job done. I have a 955 sqft apartment and centered in the middle of the apartment is this little speaker booming music throughout out all 955 sqft. This was a great buy and for the price I am definitely surprised.When I received it, it was completely dead so I waited over night and used it the next morning. I have used it everyday since and charge it at night. These would make great gifts.",5,1,2018-1-26,1,0,0
"This was purchased to replace a Jam Classic that the kids broke. The sound is good, but at high volumes the base doesn't sound super deep. I attached a video. The Jam may have been better on base. My wife uses this in the kitchen while cooking and in the garage while excising. I liked that it had a more directional set up for sound, instead of straight up like the Jam. For those who don't blast their music at top volume, there's really nothing wrong with this unit. It's actually probably perfect for most users.The phone feature was also a plus. It works well and I like that calls can be answered using the device. I bought this on the deal of day at $20, which it's worth. Not sure I'd pay much more though. Haven't had the opportunity to test out water resistance.",4,1,2015-11-11,1,0,0
"Sounds is as good as can be expected from a small speaker device, but still.... BETTER than many others and at a good price to boot.

I had purchased one of their Oontz Angle 3 speakers about a year ago (5/17) and loved it so much that I gave 3 more as gifts and they all loved them as well.

"**update*** company quickly contacted me and sent me a replacement speaker with expedited shipment. I am very pleased with how they handled business. I will be giving this product 4 stars because as I mentioned before, for the sound quality and price point, it's a great deal. I will be testing the replacement unit out for a few months, and if this one doesn't die like the previous one did, then I will consider giving the product 5 stars. Thanks your Oootz for for good costumer service.Original Post: I loved this speaker. I bought two; one for me and one as a gift. I didn't use it frequently but when I did I loved it.  One day, on a full charge, after a few minutes of listening to music on it, it suddenly turned off and never turn back on again. I am very disappointed. I knew there had to be a catch to this product. It was too good to be true (the price and sound quality was great)",4,1,2016-4-3,1,0,0
I've had this product for a year and a half now and finally where you plug the charger into the device gave way; a micro USB. However the product has become such a staple in my daily  routine that I did not even give it a second thought and immediately jumped online and purchased the 3 Ultra 14w. The 10w sound is so crisp and clear and the base...my gosh you would think it was a whole boombox.Luckily I have a backup speaker until my 14w gets here.,5,1,2018-6-18,1,0,0
"Wow!  This is awesome.  My husband was a bit skeptical when we purchased this but I think he has used it more than anyone in the house.  We use it when doing yard work, working out or even just hanging around the house.  The bluetooth works very well and the volume gets pretty high.  It is a bonus that it is water resistant.

"I like this speaker. I use it all over my house, in the bathroom while showering, in the kitchen while cooking or anywhere I wanna hear some music! This is NOT a super high quality speaker. You get exactly what you pay for. I mean it was $20! Don’t think you’re gonna get something that’ll blow your mind. I am glad I got it. It was worth the money I spent. It works well. It’s loud enough. I am happy with it. If I want something more spectacular I will spend more money. I expected to get a twenty dollar speaker and that’s what I got. It gets the job done, I’m generally happy with it! And if your expectations aren’t overly inflated, you’ll be happy with it too!!!",4,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"this is a great 30 dollar product!  its LOUD for such a small thing but most importantly it sounds good at volume.  Doesnt distort.  Probably because it has 2 speakers and most products this size only have 1.  It also delivers surprising bass for something of this size.  Many consider this a negative, but again, at volume it sounds better.  Think outdoors next to a pool setting.  Its ""semi-waterpoof"", package states dont submerge but its safe from splashes etc.Bluetooh connects easily and it takes calls, it even has a built in microphone to speak into during wireless calling.  very well thought out!  I cant think of anything on the market to beat it for 30 bucks.",4,1,2016-7-8,1,0,0
"I needed a bluetooth speaker to be used in the bathroom while I'm showering. I see that it's on the site now for $23.99 but I'm pretty sure I got it during a Black Friday or Hot Deal week or something for like $17 so figured why not, don't need much out of it anyway. Man this thing can pump some noise. Obviously I'm using it in somewhat of an enclosed space - roughly 4x10 but for this tiny speaker I could get my neighbors to come knocking on my door every day if I wanted. As far as battery life is concerned, I've been using it about 20 minutes a day since the end of November and haven't plugged it in once. Not even out of box. The thing is built like a rock too. I've dropped it twice around 3.5 feet and nothing has changed. Should something happen to this item not covered by return policy, I would buy again before looking elsewhere.There's nothing special about the sound quality.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

"If you are looking to casually listen to music or a podcast in a room or outdoors, this is a great little speaker, especially for the price! It’s several steps up from a phone speaker but doesn’t have much bass. I like to use it outside and the range is good enough where I can leave my phone connected inside but travel to the other side of my yard. Would not recommend to amplify TV sound but great value for casual use.",4,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0

I read a number of reviews before I purchased, and I did not see this mentioned. Kind of key, so I'm telling folks before they buy - this is best used with an Apple product. I haven't tested out the range outside, but inside the house (1300 sf), is quite good; sound quality is good; and volume is great.

"I received the product on time and in a condition as advertised. The speaker is plenty of loud, has a decent sound quality and connects to BT without any problems (android marshmallow, iPad OS X). The base speaker is located at the bottom of the triangular box and rocks. At very loud volumes the base speaker might make the speaker housing jump. However, the housing around the base speaker has rubber feet that minimizes the movement of the speaker on flat surfaces. The speaker housing is sturdy, well build and nicely protected at the edges by a rubbery material. Compared to the Jawbone Jambox the build and sound quality is superior. At loud volumes the Jambox distorts easily but not the OontZ Angle 3. The price is very fair, compared to the Jambox a real bargain. I will buy again, very satisfied.",5,1,2016-1-8,1,0,0
"This speaker performs well, its battery lasts long, the volume is sufficient, and it fits well in the nook of of my car console.  The only drawback is the lack of controls and the micro-USB connector.  There is only the one on-off button that makes it hard to know when it's properly pressed and will sync.  I preferred the switch on the previous model as a result.  Also, the rubber cover on the Micro-USB connector is very hard to lift up.  I have to spend 10-15 seconds digging my nail in to lift it up, but I don't want to cut it off and leave the jack exposed, either, if I can help it.  I wouldn't let those qualms discourage you from purchasing it, though.",4,1,2016-9-13,1,0,0
"I spent quite a bit of time researching speakers before deciding to purchase this one. Based upon other Amazon reviews and reviews on electronics websites I had narrowed my choices down to 3 or 4 possible choices and from the standpoint of price and reviews I chose the OontZ Angle 3.The only negative I can mention is that it's not quite as loud as I had hoped for, but it is perfect as a personal speaker at the beach for a small gathered group. It exhibits minimal distortion at full volume and seems to have a great range with much better bass than you would expect from such a small package.",5,1,2016-6-29,1,0,0
"If your looking for a blue tooth speaker that won't break the bank but is not a piece of junk, like I was, than this is perfect. The speaker has fantastic battery length, I've probably played 5-6 hours of music and the battery is right around 50-60%. The audio is more than good enough, the volume will fill a room. I see people on this website tend to either review things as "" it's the best thing ever"" or ""it's a total piece of junk"". So to bring a little reality to this review, it is a good speaker for a very good price that will more than fit the needs of anyone who's not a smug audio snob.The one thing I dislike the most is that you cannot advance the song from the speaker. The only controls on the speaker are for volume, power, and pairing the device.",4,1,2016-1-15,1,0,0

It does seem to have a slight problem at high volume levels of sounding a bit tinny perhaps, however, it works great for what I need it for.The charge seems to last forever. The only drawback I can find is the USB charge cord that is provide is about 1.5 feet long and is horribly short.

Nicely constructed, easy to use, pairs quickly, battery life very good (used it for about 8 hours straight with no problems),  But the thing is, it sounds like a $10 speaker.  So at $28, I overpaid by about 18 bucks.  It just doesn't have any oomph to it. It has no low end, the highs are not super clear either.  It is better at lower volumes, but it gets worse the louder you go. I know my 2 star rating is not going to change the average rating - but if you read this - at least you get to set your expectations correctly.",2,1,2017-1-2,1,9,0
"I bought this for my 7-year-old son's bedroom and nothing could be more perfect for him. The sounds is crystal clear! The volume is great for the size and price. It's so lightweight and compact, perfect for a dresser or night stand. I am so impressed by this product! It's so simple to use, there's no confusion. I love this thing and my son loves it too.We have a vacation coming up and I will definitely be bringing this along to the hotel room.",5,1,2017-6-29,1,1,0
Great little speak for the size and money...this little gem has pretty decent sound for the size and price range and can really belt out some volume.Charging is a snap and battery life seems to be really good.  I played this at max for over two hours and no issues.,5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"I just purchased this for my new laptop because the volume on my laptop is ridiculously low and I like to watch Netflix on it. At first, I thought it was defective because I didn't see the LED light that indicates it's charging. You need to turn on the power button and then you can see the charging light. I won't be using it as a bluetooth so I can't comment on that but as far as the sound goes, there is a lot of volume coming out of this little box!",5,1,2017-8-12,1,1,0
"For our purposes (playing classical/more relaxing music), this speaker was great. We actually purchased the recently released OontZ Angle 3 Ultra (14W) because it was a Lightening Deal -- but the Bass is so strong it sort of ""clouds"" the types of music we listen to (ie, the lyrics and/or treble sounds muffled). That said, if you enjoy music with heavy Bass, the Ultra may be the better choice.",5,1,2017-12-5,1,1,0
"Got this as a gift for my girlfriends small (SERIOUSLY TINY) inner city apartment so she could listen to music and watch her shows with some volume. Prior to this she was just using the speaker on her phone or laptop. Its a little bigger than I thought it would be but the sound is amazing for  the price point. I purchased it with a carry case that has a carabiner on it so she can latch it to her bag and take it wherever she wants. She was very happy with it streaming the coachella sets this last weekend, which was what prompted me to get it for her. Would recommend for young women, its decently cute and good quality/durable while not being overly cute (childish) or too cheap to be worth turning on.",5,1,2016-4-18,1,0,0
"Lucky for me, the speaker broke on the last day of the return period. It stopped being able to pair up with any of 3-4 devices I previously was able to pair. So I am sending it back and getting the exact same model again. Giving a benefit of a doubt given how many positive reviews it gathered. So I am hoping next one wont be a dud. Had this not happened, it would get a 5 stars from me because for the price, the make quality and the sound quality can't be beat - it's a very nice portable speaker.",4,1,2018-8-22,1,0,0
"This little speaker is great! My first bluetooth speaker was actually built into a lughtbulb that changed colors. Unfortunately, the light bulb was limited to where there was a light fixture. My friends took a bluetooth speaker kayaking and I knew that I had to get a speaker. After reading a few reviews, I decided that the OontZ Angle was the right price and looked like the safest product. It arrived two days after purchase. I was amazed by how loud this thing gets. You can adjust the volume on the speaker and from your phone. The power button is responsive after holding it for 2 seconds (the perfect amount of time). And its water resistant! The battery lasts for ages. With this thing, I've become a walking jukebox. My only regret is not purchasing the carrying case.",5,1,2016-8-6,1,0,0
It's extremely loud for a small speaker. I'm not sure if I accidentally blew a speaker the first time I used it without knowing how loud it would go or if the sound quality of the song made it sound bad. I'd normally wait a few days to review something but I'd say this is worth the money. Just make sure not to underestimate the volume.,4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I had some trouble getting it to pair with my Iphone 7 Plus at first but I emailed Cambridge Soundworks as they requested by commenting on my review. They responded lightning fast and I was finally able to get the phone to pair by resetting it.The sound is pretty good and the volume goes much higher than I expected.  I only wish I could skip to the next song on the speaker instead of having to use the phone, but this was not stated as something the speaker was supposed to do.",5,1,2016-10-30,1,0,0
"For the money, I'd recommend this speaker....easy to pair up with Amazon Echo and if one has a remotefor the Echo, it also controls the speaker's volume.  I use this outside and the sound is good.

Good sound quality and consistently easy to connect via Bluetooth (something that hasn’t been true for other devices). I also like the solid construction and long battery life after each charge. I find the design to be unobtrusive and simple.  Would recommend this to others.,5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"This speaker does exactly what I bought it to do. My mom wanted a speaker so she could listen to music and videos while working in the kitchen. Since smartphone and tablet speakers weren't loud enough for that, I bought her this sweet little Bluetooth speaker. It's easy to set up, connects quickly, and the volume goes high enough(and higher!) for her to hear clearly. Can't say anything about the battery life, as we haven't tested it specifically. All in all, great purchase!",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
"The only negative is that there isn't a good way to attach this to a beach umbrella.  Other than that the reception, connection range, waterproofing are all exceptional.  The battery life is nice and no complaints about that.  The size is such that it can stand on end and fit in a cup holder easily.  The only thing I need to find is a better way to attach to umbrella with some kind of clip.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I've had the original of this, This is the rain dance version. I do feel it's louder than my original which is nice.

I wanted a speaker that I could set in my bathroom to drowned out the exhaust fan.  I wondered if this little speaker would work well because of the low price.  I was very happily surprised to discover that it is an excellent speaker and does the job very well.  I would buy this again.I have actually purchased a second speaker. Both of them still working very well after months of daily use. They are holding their charge well and I would definitely buy this again.,5,1,2018-9-26,1,0,0
I’ve had it for over a week now with the volume as high as it can be and have not had to recharge the battery yet.  It’s small enough not to get in the way yet produces a big sound.  My 3 year old loves listening to Moana the soundtrack and when I play it on my phone she’ll constant say may I please hear it on that one (referring to the Bluetooth speaker).  Great value for the price.,5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
"I work in tech, so very rarely do I find myself in awe over the great quality of a new gadget.  I had to replace an old bose desktop bluetooth speaker.

this might have been better than my built in stereo (Honda crv 2004) my car radio broke so i figured this would be a good temporary replacement. its turned out to actually be super convenient. i plug it in to an adapter that's also charging my phone. i use the Bluetooth feature to not have to deal with extra wires. great buy for the price! it gets loud and then some!,5,1,2018-11-1,1,1,0
I received this speaker and immediately tested it out it sounds pretty good.  So I charged the speaker and decided to try it out later that night.  After hours of play and several beers I decided this was a good speaker for a chill hangout with a few friends.  Here is where this amazing little speaker started to shine.  I had the speaker setting on top of my SUV in my garage.  I left it powered and went inside by accident.  The next morning it was raining and I headed out to get my with my boys in tow.  I went to 3 different locations over the course of 2.5 hours.  The whole time it was raining.  This also included a ride down a divided highway at around 60mph.  When I returned home this little speaker was still on the roof of my SUV.  It had not moved an inch and had been rained on the whole time.  I paired the speaker to my phone and it stared playing immediately.  This was about 3 weeks ago and I have not had any issues yet.  This is reason why this is a great speaker.  You won't be disappointed.,5,1,2018-6-19,1,0,0
"I had an Oontz Angle 3 in my car for some months that I had bought in a store. It broke, and I attributed it to leaving it in my car (outdoor temperatures here regularly reach 110 F). So I bought this one from Amazon as a replacement. I keep it indoors, always. Today (two days after the return window expired), the Bluetooth kept disconnecting. Then about an hour later it died completely. I plugged it in, and it won't charge. I've tried 3 outlets, and two different cables. The cables all work on other micro-USB devices. I know this is inexpensive for a speaker, but I would hope that it could last more than 2 months with an hour of use each day. Will not be buying anymore Oontz products.",1,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"This little speaker is no joke! The sound quality is outstanding.

I can't believe how good this speaker is. I've had this speaker for two months and it still amazes me that a $25 speaker can have such a high quality sound. I use it at my pool linked up to my phone which is more than fifty feet away.  The Bluetooth set-up took all of three minutes. Great product.,5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"Sound quality is decent, but it is lacking in bass, at least compared to the Anker Soundcore. The Bluetooth connecting/playback control/volume control are all snappier and more responsive than the Soundcore. It's really light, and weighs significantly less than the Soundcore. Overall a nice little weather resistant Bluetooth speaker for its price.",5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"Sounds better than the beats pill of the same power. This speaker bumps almost as good as jbl speakers. Loud and clear, it stays connected for about 100ft. The battery lasts 8-12hrs depending on the volume. I got into a fight with this in my pocket and it got knocked out of my hands. The thing went about 50ft horizontally and still works",5,1,2018-11-28,1,1,0
Sound quality is average and bass is poor. I would have expected better from a Cambridge Soundworks product.

"I bought this to play music from my iPhone while on the go — in my 1996 Camry for instance that has nothing except an AM/FM radio with a cassette player. It sounds great within the limitations of its size: if you don't expect concert hall sound, you'll be pleased with this speaker's output. I find the best iPhone equalizer setting for this speaker is ""small speakers"" or ""treble reducer"". The unit fits perfectly just about anywhere in the car and battery life is great. The second day I had it, it failed to power up. I sent an email to the support address given in the manual and got a response within one hour: an apology for the trouble and the assurance that a replacement unit was being sent out to me that very day. It arrived in two days and has been working daily ever since. I recommend this product if you want a speaker that fits into small places, that you can take with you without adding too much weight, and that benefits from great and responsive customer service. Go for it!",5,1,2017-8-5,1,0,0
"Wow.  This tiny speaker sounds much louder than you would think. I am very happy with this purchase.  I did some research before buying it on a lightening deal and the reviews I found said it sounded as good as some $100 speakers.

If you want a great little speaker for a reasonable price, this is the one to get.",5,1,2018-8-19,1,0,0
"This is an AWESOME speaker for the money. High quality sound that stays crystal clear even at a high volume. The separate bass on the bottom really brings it all together. It was easy to pair to my iPod and iPhone, too. Plus, this comes with the 3.5mm connector that allows you to use it with non-Bluetooth products, too. I use it in an older car with a broken radio. I've never had such sound come out of the speakers in the car. I even have started using it in the kitchen while cooking, too. The sound is amazing.

"Based on the range of reviews I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I decided to take a chance and ordered one of these little buggers.While the sound isn't ZOMG! awesome, it does pretty good for its size. Similar to some of the larger speakers found in portable devices circa 1980. The range leans toward the treble. Bass is noticeable - especially when the speaker dances off  my windowsill - but if you're the type to drive around with the bass so intense that yours and the cars around your are vibrating, you're going to be seriously disappointed. On Google Play Music I switch between Jazz and Hip Hop (depending one whether it's older or newer/remastered music), with the Bass Boost about 3/4 of the way and it sounds pretty good.",5,1,2016-3-12,1,0,0

Really glad I chose this for it's durability over the magic box, which although has longer battery and skipping buttons, does not have the same water resistance.

Great as a secondary speaker for a garage, kitchen, workshop or when you don't wish to expose your main audio to the elements.A bit too heavy and stocky to lug around, but once you do get it there, it works perfect.",5,1,2018-4-10,1,0,0
"Absolutely amazing! Even after reading all the reviews, I was a little skeptical that it was all that people said it was. I was in for a pleasant surprise!!! This little speaker really packs a punch. It definitely does boost the bass, but the sound quality is still crystal clear. It also turns up extremely loud! My cat splashed water on it and it is still totally fine, so I can also attest to the water resistant claim! Also the battery life seemed to last longer than they said, but maybe that's just because it's new. This speaker isn't just good for the price, it just great in general. It's tiny, it's confinement, clear sound, high bass, amazing price. Definitely recommend!",5,1,2016-10-30,1,0,0

Let's be clear: I'm STILL looking for the ultimate portable speaker system to hook up with my iPhone (and classic iPod via the wire supplied) but until that (likely never) happens this three-sided hunk will do just fine. I've always been partial to the brand and even though it's not made in the USA it still carries the quality of the brand's rebound tradition and reputation. Sure wish it came with a case (and not about to spend a third of the price on one bought separately) and there's no chance I'm chancing any drenching with it (although I'm sure it is easily light-rain resistant) so ...all in all the best sound for me after years and countless attempts to portably channel the sound of my beloved tune carriers.,4,1,2016-7-15,1,0,0

After that it continued to work for a day then later that day it just stopped Working I tried charging it , turning it off and turning it on.

Gave it as a gift, I was totally skeptical when I saw the size of this speaker but after all, it said something with ""Cambridge Sound Works"" They are like the Audiofile version of BOSE, so I knew these had to be good and was I right! Smooth mids, clean bass, crystal highs...all for less than 22.00??? Amazing!!! And I own a $99.00 JBL FLip",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"What a POS.  I had this for 3 month, I don’t use it that much but the first time I ever charged it will not charge.  Im thinking its a software bug, so I downloaded the patch but I could not apply the patch.

"LOVE This is the fourth shower speaker I've bought, and it's the best (though in fairness, the others were about $10 each). I listen to NPR in the shower, and dialogue is hard to hear over the water usually, but this one does the job well. It's been used about three times a week for the past three months, and has not had to be recharged yet. It connects quickly to our iPhones.",5,1,2017-4-29,1,2,0
"Just received earlier this week. Gave it a full charge and connected to the Bluetooth on my iPhone to play Pandora.  We take this speaker with us when we go out in the woods and lay in our zero gravity lawn chairs.  Surprisingly good sound for such a small speaker and not difficult to use.  I also took it to the nursing home my Mother resides and I take her to a fairly quiet area and she is able to listen to her Frank Sinatra.  She is profoundly deaf, but has a very powerful hearing aid and she was able to hear the music.clearly.",5,1,2016-10-8,1,1,0
"This speaker unit is a little powerhouse. The speaker pairs with a smartphone automatically. The volume is surprisingly loud and reasonably clear.

"This is a decent Bluetooth speaker to keep on hand for impromptu parties or gatherings. It gets pretty loud but I feel that it has a ""flat"" sound to it. I won't use it for my everyday indoor speaker, but think it's good to keep in a backpack/beach bag/car so you always have a speaker if needed. I've used it by the pool and while kayaking; it does what I want and I don't have to worry about much of a financial loss if it falls in the water or gets left behind.",3,1,2018-8-10,1,0,0

"The OontZ Angle Bluetooth speaker is one of my favorite purchases from Amazon. For a small, portable speaker, the sound quality is very good. The speaker in my iPad doesn't even compare to the OontZ. I was so impressed with this product that I sent an email to Cambridge Soundworks telling them how much I liked their product. They gave me a discount on another speaker should I want to purchase one. I bought two more speakers. I had to because my granddaughter was always using mine. I gave  one to her which she loves and the other to my son-in-law. This portable speaker is so nice I'm going buy more for other family members.",5,1,2016-11-13,1,0,0

"I absolutely love this speaker; best one I've had yet. The sound is perfectly clear, even on the highest setting, and the added bass is phenomenal. The bluetooth connected almost as soon as I turned it on, and it doesn't have any problem with staying connected, even if I leave the room with my phone, which seems to be a problem with some speakers. Although I had some issues with my local post office refusing to deliver it on time, and lying about doing so, Amazon was quick to respond to my concerns, and even gave me a full refund, while also allowing me to keep the speaker when it finally did come. Overall, this speaker is perfect for anyone who wants big sound on a small speaker - lightweight and small enough to carry around. I highly recommend this speaker to anyone and everyone.",5,1,2018-2-10,1,0,1
"I bought this speaker to avoid spending $300 on a new auto stereo system (because the AUX jack quit working).  I use it exclusively in the car and always plugged into the charging port, so I have no idea about battery life.  I listen only to spoken word podcasts, so I can't say how well it reproduces music.  Sometimes the road noise will overpower a recording that could have been recorded at a higher level, but most of the time it's fine.  I could replace this speaker every 6 months and go a long time before I reach the cost of replacing the stereo system.  I've had it for nearly 4 months and use it pretty much every day.  All good, so far.",5,1,2018-11-12,1,0,0
"I bought one of these and really liked it. It is still going strong after more than a year of occasional use of several times a week. Since I liked it, I bought a second unit to use with my desktop computer. I don't listen to music at a loud volume anymore, those years have gone by. After only 3 months of very occasional light use, the second unit has a blown speaker sound. I checked the warranty, and it only lasts for 90 days. Quite disappointed with the purchase of the second unit. It might be understandable if I was blasting the music, but that was not the case.",1,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

"Great speaker for the price and size. May end up ordering the carry case for it cause it may go more places with me than expected. Easy to pair (my mom even figured out how to pair and use it). It will definitely fill a room with sound. Could even hear it throughout the downstairs while it was in the office. Not sure how long the battery lasts. Like that my iPod Touch gives me some heads up to the battery's charge. Some reviews seem to expect Bose quality sound for a fraction of the cost. While it may not sound like a Bose, it's amazing for the price. The highs could be a little crisper but the lows and mids are great. I use it for podcasts and some music and it fits the need well.",5,1,2016-5-12,1,0,0

I'm not a fan of bluetooth so I don't use it that way too often.

"This is a great little Bluetooth speaker for the money. It seems well-made, is rubberized on the ends to protect against falls, and the sound is better than a $100 Bluetooth speaker that we bought several years ago. One minor design flaw is that being all one color, and basically symmetrical from any angle, you have to examine it closely to see which way the speakers are facing. It would be great if the metal speaker face was distinguished from the other two faces by being a different color. Highly recommended!",5,1,2017-1-4,1,1,0

"Wanted to have a speaker to stream and play music when i didn't want to turn on my stereo.  the Oontz is fairly small and not too heavy.  the buttons are well placed and have a definite click to them so you know it has been pressed.  the usb cable is fairly short.  could be a bit longer.  it pairs fairly fast and easy to pair with my samsung s5.  the rubber flap that covers the charge and input holes is a hassle and hard to keep in but not a deal breaker.  sound is good and can be pretty loud.  as other reviewers stated, it is more on the treble side but depending on location there is some bass.  not as loud and low as the jambox, but also 5x cheaper in price.  not sure about battery life yet but i'm sure it will be decent for my needs.  i wish there was a hook of some sort so it can hang from a backpack and use while walking.  not a bad speaker for $20.",4,1,2015-11-17,1,0,0

"Just bought this for WFH as after 1.5 months, I can't stand headphones.  I wanted to listen to podcasts and have a small speaker for conf calls.  This fits perfectly except for one thing - when on a conf call, it turns off after 15 minutes as using the microphone apparently isn't considered the same as audio like a podcast/music.  Luckily it's hooked up to my laptop so the laptop speaker picks up the call and I turn the device back on.  It's annoying and seems silly since it does say it can be used for this purpose but now that I've figured it out, I just turn the speaker back on. For the price, I can live with it - if not for this issue it would get 5+ stars.",4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0

Just got it today. So far so good. It is surprisingly loud for such a small speaker. The sound is crisp and the bass is very good. The sound really fills a large room. My only criticism is that it didn't come with a charging cord. Now I have to try to find one that fits.,4,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I wont lie, this is possibly the best bluetooth speaker I have ever purchased. Considering price, quality of build, battery life and connectivity, the overall product is something special. The sound is actual quality and the speaker has not once became distorted even with my phone turned up to maximum volume. For the price, I doubt you'll find something better and it may even rival more expensive speakers of the same size.",5,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0
"While the price of this item was the deciding factor, what I really liked was the triangular design which allows it to fit securely in more places.  The sound quality is good and battery life will vary depending on volume - like all of these speaker products.  What could be improved is the ability to add some bass  - the music can sound a bit tinny sometimes.",3,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I'm using this with my TV. It sounds like I'm using surround sound. I tried it with my Apple IPOD but the jack is not compatible. However it does work with my Mac Mini. It comes with a 6 inch USB cord to charge using the USB port on the TV, but it's too short and dangled from the back. It also can't charge when the TV is off. I had a spare 3 ft cord from an old cell phone and that works to charge by plugging into an outlet. I would have given 5 stars if the charger cord had been 3 ft.",4,1,2017-2-11,1,1,0
"Decent, but not great sound.  If you want great sound, spend the extra money and buy the JBL Flip 3.  Yeah, the Flip 3 sounds THAT much better.  If you just want ""decent"" sound at a rock bottom price, the Angle 3 works.  It's better than a lot of the small/cheap BT speakers in that it has SOME bass ability, but it just can't match the Flip 3.  The Flip 3 is also 3 times the price.  So for the price, this is a decent speaker.  Just don't expect good bass and ""room filling"" sound.",4,1,2018-1-9,1,0,0
"While I appreciate the small form factor and low price - this product did not deliver on its promises. I really wanted to like it and had high hopes of listening to music at the beach, and having a moderately priced unit that I wouldn't stress if it was lost or stolen. I ended up being too embarrassed of the quality to take it anywhere and was wishing that someone had taken it.I am not an audiophile, but I was immediately underwhelmed at the missing mid's and low's. It sounds just slightly better than audio from a laptop.",2,1,2016-6-23,1,0,0
I just got this speaker so I can only say that the sound quality is really good for a speaker so small and inexpensive.  It connected to my laptop with very little effort and it sounds really nice.  I cannot say anything about the battery life or the reliability of the unit as I haven't had it long enough to evaluate those qualities.  What I can say is so far really good.,5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
"These speakers are great.  I was hoping to actually audio cable two of these together sometimes but couldn't get it to work no matter what.  I tried a splitter and it cuts one out.  Otherwise, this speaker is great.  I had the original Oontz Angle and loved it but it didn't get as loud as this speaker no did it have as much bass as this one.  ON top of that the first wasn't splash proof waterproof.  I don't see why you would buy any other blue tooth speaker for more money unless it has things this just doesn't have but good luck with that.  It rocks!",5,1,2018-5-19,1,0,0
"This little speaker sounds great. It has more volume than most. And the chargeable battery lasts pretty well. I just bought one to check it out. Now I need to buy another one for stereo. They are decent little speakers for what they are. Bought a second one, they pair easily. The sound is much better with two of them. They have pretty good bass response for a small speaker.",4,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
Easy to connect with Bluetooth on Samsung Galaxy. Had it paired up and running in a couple minutes. No reception issues. Holds a charge well.  Try the function on Samsung Galaxy that allows you to open two windows at once so music can be listened to in the background in one window while working in the other window. Works well for soft music while reading or listening to an audio book. Respectable sound from a tiny box. Haven't tried it as a phone. Came with USB cable (no wall adapter) and 3.5mm audio cable.,4,1,2017-10-28,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker because it was marked as amazons choice in Nov 2018. When I received it I was disappointed with its sound quality, which was not acceptable to me, so I returned the product.  I like the speaker that I bought last year, and it was last year’s amazons choice 2017. I re-ordered the same model that I had last year. Sound quality of what I already have is about 100 times better than this one.  It is a mistake that Amazon has changed its amazons choice for this year fromm the last years amazons choice. This cost me the cost of return shipping. I have not tested the battery life because i returned it on the same day I received it.",1,1,2018-11-16,1,1,0
"This was one of the best purchases I have ever made! The sound quality is so much better than my echo dot and my iphone X. I love that I can carry it to any room to listen to my music and it's so simple to connect to my dot and phone. I take it from room to room, outside on the patio, and even into the bathroom while I shower so I can listen to music from my phone without my phone being in the room (don't want the steam to damage it!). I highly recommend this product! Great sound quality. great battery life, easy controls!",5,1,2018-5-26,1,0,0
"Sure, it provides great sound at a great price, but it has some return-inducing flaws: 1) it's definitely smaller than it appears in the pictures; 2) the power button is in the back, so if you place the speaker in, e.g., your car's compartment, you have to take the speaker out to turn it on; and 2) it doesn't make a sound when you turn it on, so you're never quite sure if you've turned it on or not; does the red light mean it's on and/or only recharging? Returned.",3,1,2018-4-11,1,0,0
My son and I have this speaker for my shop and it has been left outside in a storm and even survived a fire the other day and has a hole in it caused by  scorching heat and it still holds a charge and pretty decent considering what it’s been through.  This  is an amazing speaker.,5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
Easy to use. Awesome sound. A surprisingly nice Bass which is exactly what I wanted. Compact so it doesnt take up much space on my desk. Would definitely buy another. Havent tested out the water resistance but I honestly dont see myself using purposefully in the rain. But it's nice knowing it can hold up to something accidental.,5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker for my bathroom and travel (along with a travel case) and have been very pleased. It's light weight, easy to sync and I love that it's rechargeable. The sound is pretty darn good for being so small and the music stops if my phone rings (which can be heard through the speaker) then resumes when the ringing stops. Can't beat the price for a cool little gadget I use daily.",5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0
"I'm extremely pleased with this tiny speaker. When I first opened the box I was a little set back by the tiny size of speaker - my expectation was poor sound from such a small size. My expectations were shattered when it was powered up and paired up with my phone, it had a big sound clear and crisp! It had bass but again remember this is a tiny speakers with very small drivers so don't expect thumping bass. I also hooked it up to my tv and it sounded great as well.Battery life has been 6-7 hours at medium volume. It charges thru USB - please note NO charger included use your phones but at least they included a USB cable. Pairing with phone was super easy.",5,1,2016-12-13,1,0,0
"Nice little speaker for small to medium size rooms.  Brought my family running to see what was the music source when it was tested.  Sound was true to the balanced source.  Vertical position produced the most open sound flow.  Only one device can be paired via Bluetooth or can use a 3.5mm sound cable plug.  Seems built sturdily and good balance on it side or standing vertically.  Have not tested the battery for duration, recharge time, or life expectancy.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"I'm a musician, so I'm super picky about speakers. I was a little nervous about ordering this one after reading reviews.  I could not be happier with this speaker! The volume is very appropriate for our large living room. We pair it with the Echo Dot.  The bass is not weird at all.  I have heard no cheap speaker vibrating or distortion that you sometimes hear. I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this speaker.",5,1,2017-7-15,1,1,0
"I earlier had a Bose speaker which failed.  I was hesitant to replace with this one that was so much lower priced.  Boy am I glad I did.  It has excellent sound quality.  The ONLY poor design feature is that it's hard to see the volume and other button labels in low light or if I'm not wearing my glasses.  The labels are black on black, and just don't have enough contrast to show up well.",5,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"I'm an older person with severe ringing in the ears. This speaker allows me to hear the TV without having to disturb neighbors by blasting the tv sound.

"I bought this speaker as an upgrade to the dollar store Bluetooth speaker I've had for ages. This speaker is the designated speaker for my desktop, and as such has been on almost 24/7 for the last year as is the computer. I cant speak much for the battery life because the device is almost always plugged in, but apart from that the sound was fantastic when I bought it and hasn't decreased in quality in the time Ive been using it.Im very happy with my purchase because it fits my use case, I speak much for the other qualities of the speaker but other views can speak to that.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
This is a great little speaker for the price. I take it with me on my boat every weekend and while we swim we listen to it for hours and hours. Music is loud and quality is good. Bluetooth hooks up to phone extremely easy. Seems to be even somewhat water resistant. I highly recommend this little speaker.,5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"Bought this for my boyfriend who adored it. Used it every single day, proudly showed off it's powerful volume from the neat tiny design. We were both heartbroken when it suddenly stopped working about 8 months after purchase. Had to search for another more reliable model (ANKER SoundCore 2 - so far working well, slightly less loud and attractive, but better sound quality). Still miss this cleverly named, affordable little speaker. Really wish it lasted longer.",3,1,2019-2-14,1,1,0
"This was actually smaller than expected, but it packs a strangely large sound. Bass  is clear, but it not going to be thundering. Overall sound is clean and with almost no distortion at high levels.I like the shape too, wont fall over on you. Great for outdoors by fire pits and the battery is decent oo. Gets surprisingly loud. Im just overall impressed, id buy it again.",4,1,2019-1-22,1,0,0
The sound is great coming from an i-phone but if you planned to use Bluetooth transmitter/receiver aka gateway it didn't sound so good. That's not the fault of the speaker though. The gateway may have just needed an inexpensive line level controller cable. The application I was planning to use these speakers and the gateway for was to have the gateway connected to a CD changer and have the gateway transmit the sound to 3 bluetooth  speakers in different rooms of the house. I found out that bluetooth technology is not currently able to transmit to more than one speaker. You can have three different transmitters each sending a signal to one speaker but that's not what I wanted to do. So they all go back.,5,1,2016-4-25,1,0,0

"Was originally looking at an ""Anker"" BT speaker but took a chance with this OontZ Angle speaker after checking the reviews. This thing is awesome at this price point, sure it may not have the larger battery or provide as much bass as some of the higher end BT Speakers that are 3-4 times the price. I can't speak on it's ""weatherproof"" features but I've took this unit camping, had it outdoors while doing yard work & inside doing construction - it has performed well in all conditions and sounded great.If you want a no-nonsense BT speaker that doesn't break the bank, click ""add to cart"" now and enjoy!

I bought this speaker in 2017 it worked beautifully sound was excellent as a music teacher it was exactly what I wanted....Almost two years now I have this issue where I would charge it and when I unplug it the red light will continue to flash until the batry is fully drained even if it's off.......ibam certain it's due to some poor construction of the mother board,3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"For a cheap speaker, this thing rocks. The battery life so far has been stellar and its very easy to connect to via bluetooth or aux cable.

"I purchased this speaker so I could listen to audio books from my phone, outside. The sound is fine if the speaker is facing the exact direction that I am working. The area of the sound is not as large as I had assumed from the reviews I had read. So my final decision on this is, it works fine for me as long as I move the speaker with me as I work, and for the price, I will not return it. It is certainly better than my phone's volume, or having to wear headphones. I have no problems with the length of the battery life for general use. If you are looking for a speaker to listen to music at a party, this is not the speaker for you.One of the biggest problems with this speaker is the charging cord. It is VERY short. It makes it difficult to charge it, anywhere. You need the perfect location which means you can't really bring it outside to charge if you need long term use of the speaker. I like to listen to baseball (GO RED SOX) while I garden and this is a major issue to deal with!",3,1,2016-7-8,1,1,0
"I'm always going through Bluetooth speakers because I'm too cheap to buy a high end one. So I read online that this was one of the top adorable speakers.

I can hear it through the whole house rather than have to carry it from room to room! I love it.

"This is a pretty small speaker but it has a really big sound. It was just pennies more than a few other ""no name"" units that were similar but I am familiar with Cambridge SoundWorks bigger speakers and they are great. I was hoping this little one would be OK but it is much more than OK. It sounds so good you have to be able to hear it to believe it. I am rarely surprised by the quality of what I buy, but this speaker is surprisingly great.

"So the first thing I noticed once I had music playing was a dripping faucet like sound. Then I realized that the speaker picks up your typing sound on the iPad, duh.  This little puppy puts out some sound!  The only thing I really don't like is the ""tinny"" sound.  I don't know if these types of devices come with bass, treble and the like. That is why the four star. If you are a maniaic about that type of thing this probably is not the correct one for you. I based my decision only in other reviews since I know nothing about this type of thing. The other reason someone might not like it is because you cannot talk to it. So if you are lazy and don't want to get on your iPad or phone another reason not to get thisFor not having anything prior, I am happy how something so small blasts out so much sound.

My advice is to find another brand offering the same features and a lengthier, better warranty.",1,1,2019-1-14,1,1,0
"The OontZ Angle 3, Bluetooth portable speaker is a great little wireless speaker. It's compact, lightweight, fits anywhere for on-the-go, and most importantly, it has tremendous high quality sound that fills a room. It's range of sound is incredible...it's like listening to a complete stereo system like the one I had a long time ago but with enough equipment to fill a whole console. This little device can really blast out the volume and it's as clear sounding as can be. It's really amazing! I couldn't believe the value either, it was very affordable. I received my OontZ Angle 3 within 3 days just like the seller said I would. I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this product.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,1
"I gave this speaker to my teenage son for Christmas and he loved it! Delivery was fast and the packaging was efficient, nothing broken upon arrival. Easy to connect to bluetooth and to charge with the two charging cables included. The sound was incredible for such a small speaker, it was crisp and clear. Brought it with us to several parties and the volume booster worked excellent, a great feature. Actually, family and friends loved it too! Great portable speaker and I would recommend the OontZ brand to anyone in the market for one!",5,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
"The Oontz Angle is a certified piece of crap. I thought I'd meet in the middle of price and functionality instead of going for a bluetooth speaker in the hundreds, but this really cuts corners on quality. It hardly stays charged even if you have it plugged in all day, and it gave up on me after 6 months. I guess that's an alright lifespan, but the previous speaker I had lasted almost two years. I'll be looking for a new one now that won't end up in the trash after half a year of light use.",2,1,2018-8-4,1,0,0
"I NEVER leave reviews after I first get the product. (Too many things can happen over a few days, weeks, etc.) I just got this speaker an hour ago. WOW. I am ready to buy 10 more and space them around my home. Incredible sound for their size! Small, compact, nice design, inexpensive. Will buy again!",5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"This device was even smaller than I pictured it, but wow does it pack a punch. To give you an idea, I was giving a presentation in a room of about 30 people and used this speaker for sound, and had to turn it DOWN. The bass is probably about as good as it can be in a speaker this size. The only annoyance is that there is a slight audio delay with video, but I've seen worse. It pairs seamlessly and works great. It being waterproof (read: splash-proof) is a nice perk.",5,1,2017-3-26,1,1,0
I love this Bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is top notch. I can move it with me from room to room as I clean but I really don’t have to with how well the sound output is.  I love how portable it is my husband will take it with him to use for his presentations and I can use it for outings with the kids at the park or the beach. The battery life is also excellent! I get many hours of use from my speaker. I have had my speaker for about 6 months and have had no issues with it!,5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
"When I purchased this product initially, I was skeptical. With so many other bluetooth speakers out there running for $50-$150, how high of quality can this ~$28 speaker actually be?But it was cheap, there were 12,000 reviews, and the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot.",5,1,2017-2-4,1,0,0
"Doesn't work with my Samsung Phone. The sound is garbled.  I have a different brand bluetooth speaker which works perfectly with everything I've paired it including my phone so it's not a phone ""problem"". It does work with my ASUS tablet and my iPad  perfectly well. Bought it when it was on a sale hyped through Yahoo. Won't do that again. Will likely give it away to someone who's phone/devices it does work with",3,1,2018-9-27,1,0,0

"When I first got this speaker I loved it.  I was able to put the speaker across the room and use the treadmill while hearing my devise so well.  However, now I have to put the speaker on a shelf above my head to even barely hear it.  I thought it may be that the battery was low so I recharged it, but it didn’t help.  I would not recommend this speaker.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
My first speaker developed a battery issue after 30 days. Contacted the company who insisted on sending out a new one priority mail. The new one works great. The sound is good and connection is easy. The shape is perfect for placing on a narrow shelf like in a shower.  I do not let it get wet however it says it is IPX5 rated.,5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
Work great and boyfriend absolutely loved the gift! He’s taken it to work at his bar and the sound is EXCELLENT! We also took it to Ireland with us and it was easy to charge and we enjoyed listening to our music through it while backpacking for two weeks.  Very much looking forward to having it this summer and taking it to the lake with us. Perfect for the price and not superheavy and clunky adding weight to the bag. Would buy again and again as gifts or for myself!,5,1,2018-4-12,1,0,0
"Gave this speaker as a birthday gift to a dear friend due to its great reviews. From her feedback to me, the nice reviews are spot on! She loves her new Oontz Angle 3! The quality and volume of sound it puts out is great for its size and class. Her daughter now wants her speaker and that should speak volumes (pardon the pun) as to its performance. Heck, may have to get myself one now. High marks and highly suggest this little speaker for those shopping around for portability without sacrificing quality in a blue tooth speaker.",5,1,2017-3-19,1,1,0
"My learning curve was with little 2 watt speakers. But this little puppy is nice! Its 10 watt and what a difference from the 2 watt. Now I know what your thinking well it's 8 watt more it would be better! Well the glee comes from the fact that I spent $20 on a little 2 watt and $28 on the 10 watt. It connects with no problems, take it in the bathroom to shower and get ready, rubber feet keeps it stable, the sound is great (I only listen to podcasts though) and the price was nice! So yes it's about 3 x bigger than my 2 watt Bump but it's worth it to hear. I haven't worn it down on battery power yet but I decided I would but now it's been like 6-8 podcasts and my phone goes dead before my OontZ does so now I have to wait till I'm having a podcast marathon so I don't forget when the OontZ started. If my opinion changes I will let you know but well worth the money. Oh and I thought I would get the custom case but since I use it so much the box is fine cuz I use it for travel and I feel I'm getting better protection with the nice square box.",5,1,2016-2-1,1,2,0
I must be getting old.  I'm surprised at the clarity and power of this unit.  I used to have boomboxes that weighed as much as a cinder block that didn't sound this good.  The bluetooth pairs quickly and indicates pairing with a bleep-bleep tone.  Sound quality is really balanced.  I owned a docking speaker by Phillips that had way too much bass and sounded muffled but this unit sounds clear with crisp trebles and a smooth bass.This little thing is a joy and a big step up from listening to music out of my built-in tablet speaker.  The wireless bluetooth connection makes it a clean and flexible setup in my workspace.  I love it.,5,1,2016-7-6,1,0,0
"I bought this a little over six months ago to listen to music while I cook. I wanted to really get some use before I left a review, as I base my purchase decision from the reviews left by others. I have had no issues with with my unit and find the sound surprisingly good for such a small speak. Good base . Voices sound clear. No distortion. I would say fora small room or bathroom it works perfectly. However.....I would say it doesn't have the output for a large room or a large party gathering outside.",5,1,2017-5-29,1,1,0

"This really delivers great sound for your laptop or phone, it connects with my computer but has no sound - this is honestly mostly likely a human error on my part.It’s small enough to take on the go & again, sound quality is great! I highly recommend!",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
For a small speaker it does give off great volume. I would say the only flaw is there is no notice before the battery just dies. Purchased speaker on July31st. And by Sept 1. It had quit working..battery won't charge.. Tried different charging cables. Outlets etc..,2,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"This is a great portable Bluetooth speaker, at first. But unfortunately after only 6 months of use (indoors), the charging port no longer works, and I’m outside of the window for refunds or product support so I guess I’m out of luck. The speaker has been used only inside my apartment, and mainly travels between my bathroom and kitchen counters. I’ve never dropped it and it’s never been exposed to any kind of rough treatment, which leads me to believe the charging port is just flimsy. At this point, I can plug the cable into it, but it’s barely held in place and doesn’t charge at all. For the past six months, I’d have given it a 5 star rating, but this kind of ruins it for me. I don’t want to buy a new one twice a year.",1,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"Rather loud for its size. I bought this to take with me camping and out on my kayak. The volume is impressive for its size. Dont expect too much bass out of it but due to its size, not to be expected. It paired with both my laptop and cell instantly, controls both volume on both devices, and is LOUD for its size. I have other high end bluetooth speakers that are much much more pricey, and yes, they sound better, but they are also dedicated house speakers and 4 times the size and 1000% more in price, so... The only thing i wish this did have is some way to attach a leash/cable/anchor to it to be able to tie it off or secure it to something. It is about the size of a 12 oz can, little larger length wise. Other than that, i have zero complaints of it so far. For the price, I think it is more than a bargain. Sound is clear when used without any equalizer on whatever device you use.",5,1,2016-5-27,1,0,0
"**Update December 2016. Speaker is no longer working reliably. Turns itself on and off continuously. Five stars to one starPretty good sound and volume level. Connects easily to all of my devices. Seems to have very good battery life as well. An update. August 7 2016. This little speaker continues to amaze me. When the input is of high quality, this speaker will really put out. Bass, treble and mids are no issue. If the input source is crap, well it produces crap. Battery life is very good. Connects easily to devices via wireless.",1,1,2016-7-20,1,1,0
The sound is great. We use it on the ski boat and think nothing about it getting wet or rained on. Keeps on playing. Holds a charge a good while. Surprisingly good sound for the price!We love it so much we gave one to a friend to replace a little crappy one she was using during her cookout.,5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"Look, let me make this simple: GET IT! Man, this thing will blow your mind! Seriously! It is small and dynamically powerful. The bass is super full and it just sneaks up on you and rattles your dome! I am thoroughly blown away at how this little speaker performs. I've NEVER heard a speaker this small sound the way it does. Amazing! Get it, period!",5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
The speaker was connected to my laptop through Spotify. The volume is almost maxed out(95%) and so far so good. I tried it with the volume all the way up and it is still pretty good. Not bad for the price you are getting it for.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Wanted a cheap-ish bluetooth speaker so I could listen to music/podcasts when I am out at pool, or working around house/yard. This works great. It has been in the humidity of my bathroom when I shower, and splashed at the pool. Is holding up great. Good basic speaker, your not going to be hearing the thump of any bass if thats what you like though. Lasts pretty long, when the volume starts to go down I know its close to needing a charge.",4,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"I'm not an audiophile like some of the others that have written reviews on Bluetooth speakers, so there is no in-depth comparison I'll make to other speakers' sound quality compared to the OontZ Angle.  However, I do like to know when I buy a wireless speaker that it'll work easily and reliably with sound quality that the un-discerning ear will enjoy. I've had this speaker for a couple of weeks now and I really like it - it is much better than the few others from other manufacturers that I've bought from over the years.  This speaker has come in the shower with me and performed as expected, and it has survived an afternoon by the pool with kids splashing about and the hot sun bearing down on it all afternoon.  Switching between users in my family with all of our devices is effortless.  And I've even dropped this a couple of times on the concrete and the rubberized edges did a great job of protecting the speaker.  All in all, I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a simple to use, relatively small form factor speaker with good sound.",5,1,2016-5-30,1,0,0
"I'm not big on reviews, but had to leave one for this product. I had been looking for something small and portable since most of my music is on my phone now. Gotta say I was impressed. Spurred on by the good reviews I purchased at a great price and tested it right away. Started with Bohemian Rhapsody and Killer Queen. It sounded really great. Ultimate test for my catalogue was Foo fighters Monkey Wrench. A bit more distortion there but suppose that's to be expected.  Looking forward to using this little baby alot. Highly recommended.",4,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0
"Remarkable sound for such a small speaker.  Easy set-up, comes charged. Charger doesn't have a wall plug, only USB, but this is fine. Just really impressed with the sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, but I know this is good sound for the size and price.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"This speaker came a little earlier than expected.Just so you know what quality of sound I'm use to I own a jbl soundbar and subwoofer, dre Beats headset and a Sony soundbar with subwoofer. Opened the box and was worried about its size and quality. Connected it very easy and when I cranked up the music I was very impressed! It's loud! It doesn't have a massive amount of bass but for its price and size it does just fine. I listen to all kinds of music and it sounds good with all of it. No distortion when it's full blast and the quality is perfect even when on the highest volume.",5,1,2016-12-7,1,0,0

Great speaker. Had for 3 yrs or so battery lasts all day at work and charges no troubles.They say its weather proof and in my experience I took it with on a kayak trip. It fell in the river for like 3 minutes while on and playing music. And when I got it out the water it was still working. It's still work and that kayak trip was over a year ago!!!!,5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,1
"This is a perfect travel size speaker with amazing volume and bass. Bluetooth pairing was painless as it should be. I like the feature of the system shuts down if not in use to save battery power. This speaker appears to be very well made with quality materials. I'm using it primarily as a speaker for a Amazon Tablet, but I believe this would make for a great outdoor speaker while working in the yard and such. I wish I had ordered the travel case at the same time.",5,1,2018-5-25,1,0,0
Really liked it at first but we've only had it a month and already having trouble connecting it to our iPhones. It took us 2 days to get it connected and then we didn't even want to use it at the time. Giving it 3 stars because when it does work it sounds and works well!UPDATE:,5,1,2017-1-5,1,0,0
"Arrived quickly and just as advertised!  It puts out a good bit of nice, clear sound, especially considering the small size! I haven't even been able to fully crank it up yet as my roomates would probably kill me, but what I've gotten to do sounded pretty amazing for such a small speaker!  ""Phenominal cosmic power!

"So far this little guy is awesome. This is my fourth Bluetooth speaker, third battery powered. This thing gets loud! Much louder than my previous speakers. It's simply designed, all the necessary buttons. Rubber ends, handy rubber feet(see pic) and rubber cover for the micro USB and aux ports, it even looks to have a raised plastic lip around the micro usb port either to support the plug when plugged in against breakage or for a better seal. (See pic) The bluetooth 4.0 connects easily to my Note 4. The range seems average, it did disconnect when I left it on my front porch and walked two rooms away with my phone. I'll have to get back to you on the battery life. But it charges at 5v, 1amp.",5,1,2017-7-5,1,1,1
Very impressive! Sound quality is amazing and very loud... I have the original JBL go didn't want to spend the money on that again so I came across this read the reviews and I will never go back to the JBL go I will definitely be ordering another one! Connectivity is very easy doesn't give you any problems.. I also really like and this is a major plus is the fact that when the speaker connects to the phone a message comes up on your phone telling you the battery life on the device! Highly recommended! And of course the price is on point!,5,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"It's a solid bluetooth speaker - just like others have said, it can produce a lot of volume for its size (about 1.5 times the size of my hand). The bass imitation is a nice touch, too, as another reviewer has alluded to in his comparison. I just wanted to add that sound only emits from one lateral face of this prismatic speaker, which disappointed me because I was expecting two. This product loses a star for me since the sound quality, while decent for its price, is definitely not impressive by any means. Kinda wish I had spent more on a nicer speaker then, but I appreciate the robust/durable design.",4,1,2016-5-28,1,1,0
"I haven't had the product long enough to access the battery life, thus I did not rate it. However, I am highly satisfied with this product. I connected with my tablet without any issue.

So my other speakers are JBL so what I have to compare it to may not be fair. It’s is clear but tinny sounding and the blue tooth does not reach very far.... if you walk to another room it cuts off pretty quickly... on the positive side .it does hook up easily to the phone and seems to last for several hours.,3,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0

I turned off the speaker and restarted it and tried to connect like I had the previous day, again, with no luck. After 1 and a half hours of trying, and I'm an IT professional, with no connection I boxed it up and returned it. Don't waste your time on this unless you want a paper weight.",1,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I purchased this item because the ratings appeared great and in the description they claim LONGER BATTERY PLAYTIME UP TO 14 HOURS - Play from morning till night; Built-in rechargeable battery can play up to 14 hours at 2/3 volume. At that volume level 2/3 it might as well be off since it's too low to enjoy, so I play it at 6/7 and within 2 hours the volume starts to get lower due to battery levels dropping. I seriously doubt you can get 14 hours of continuous or morning till night playtime as they claim. BT connectivity and sound were really good, battery not enough to sell this product",3,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0

"Totally worth the price. Sound is fantastic and carries well for such a small/light speaker. Battery life is AMAZING, I feel like I rarely have to charge it and feel surprised when I do. I haven't dropped it or kicked it around so I can't say anything about that kind of durability. Worst thing about it for me: You may have to manually use your phone to select the bluetooth connection if you switch between multiple phones/systems even though your phones all recognize it.",5,1,2018-2-25,1,0,0
"Amazing speaker! Gets the job done especially for the size! The batter lasts forever it seems like we never charge it.

I really like  this speaker. I really wanted to find a good wireless speaker I could bring to my pool that isn't terribly expensive. This one meets all my criteria and has a good volume output.

The only thing I wish I'd known about before I bought it, is that there is an XL version for only slightly more. I think I would prefer that version as I don't need the compactness as much. This thing is loud enough, but I think it would be nice to have the bigger one. Overall it's as good as any standard size speaker of any big name brand. The only feature that something like the UE Boom has over it is the paring of multiple speakers. But I would definitely purchase this again over a more expensive speaker.",5,1,2017-5-3,1,1,0

Like it can't be that good right? Well, in this case, it is. You feel how good put together and sturdy it is and it will serve for a long time.

The sound is tuned for most average listening person. My husband is hearing impaired ( certain sound leaves) and he can hear talk radio and music very well when we us the speaker. It is made well, feels good in your hands, I think the only improvements I would make is to make the power, volume and portals buttons more visual (colored). The all black cover makes it hard to see those buttons in dim light or if you have visual problems.",5,1,2016-1-9,1,0,0

I am going to buy more and tell my friends at college and my family.  The price is also amazing and it came before time.  It is also so light and portable to take to the beach, use when studying, camping, and more.  So I am delighted to have this speaker.

I’ve done the hard reset as described in the product literature and that did nothing.Ps. The sound is terrible also.

Unable to get Blue tooth to connect. It stopped working. Now we have a $30 device we can’t use and it’s too late to return it.  We didn’t think the service contract was necessary since there are really nom” moving parts” and we thought it would last at least 9 months to a year,1,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"Small but LOUD.  I purchased this Bluetooth speaker to replace an older one.  For the same sound, this speaker is a lot smaller, at least 2 times with great battery life.  I can play music for hours before a recharge.  I take this speaker everywhere.  It's perfect for the hotel on trips, have it play in my bag while I ride my bike, etc.  As a dancer, this is perfect for me to bring to the studio to have my music with me whenever I go.  My only complaint is that my protective mesh in the front of the speaker pops off from time to time, but this is definitely worth the money.",5,1,2017-11-1,1,0,0
"This device won't blow your mind. It has a lot of treble, as you would expect.  It can get extremely loud.  If your purpose of this device is for personal use to have some music in the background, its fine.  You won't be able to throw parties with this speaker as the centerpiece, its just not meant for that.  The sound is very similar to my Google Home Mini, the mini actually sounds a little better, to be honest.",4,1,2018-8-30,1,0,0
I cannot believe how good this sounds in comparison to the Soundbot we purchased previously!  I never would have bought this because it was too expensive by the deal of the day made it a no brainier.  Only complaint is the range is not great. But in range absolutely no complaints.  The sound is smoother and less tinny. Importantly the latency experienced with the Soundbot is virtually gone as we use this for extending TV sound from family room to kitchen.  Perhaps the biggest compliment is we watched 1st episode of Jessica Jones not realizing we were using the Oontz!12/27/15-the range issue is a bigger deal than I thought. The 12 foot range is pretty sucky.  This is a bigger deal tha I thought it would be,5,1,2015-11-21,1,0,0
Great sound from such a tiny speaker. It was easy to connect to my phone and to my Dot so I can easily play music by speech only. I played it all day while working outside and it was still going strong after about 9 hours at mid volume. So far I’m impressed. I’m going to give it a month of use to see how it holds up and may order a second one.,5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"This small BT speaker sounds amazing for the size and price. Very good sound quality. I have a very nice balance of low, mids and highs.

Know I can listen to phone calls very clearly and also run podcasts on my I phone which I like to do driving 5-7 hours a day as a sales person.The sound is awesome.

"The Oontz Angle 3 is a nice sounding portable bluetooth speaker. The size is good and the sound quality is decent. I have successfully paired it with iOS devices as well as Android devices with no issues. The only problem I have had is with pairing to an Ooma Telo using their proprietary bluetooth USB dongle. I was hoping to use it with the Ooma so that a hard of hearing relative could better hear phone calls. But that can be worked around using paired cell phones. I gave this item four stars because to me, the design could be improved. The buttons are hard to make out from the material and so it is harder to operate than I expected. Otherwise, it works and I got it at a great price. Thanks!",4,1,2016-7-10,1,0,0

"Love this speaker! For its size, it puts out big enough sound for my morning workouts, while I'm in the shower, or when we want portable audio while watching a ballgame in the evening. Crystal clear on vocals and instrumentals. It picks up on things the TV's speakers never do like voices in the crowd, the ""clack"" of bats in the rack (not the belfry!) etc.My only complaints are that the power/charging cable port is a little difficult to access and - because of its monochromatic design/ style, the controls can be a bit hard to find. But it's a ""feel"" thing and didn't take a whole lot of getting used to. I might step up to a pricier model next time with bigger sound and definition (i.e., treble/bass) and more features, but this little wonder has more than sufficed for now.",5,1,2018-8-24,1,0,0

Also, for the lake so I don't have to get my iPhone close to the water  -- Volume control on the speaker prevents running back and forth to the sound source.For an extra $10: make sure you also buy the carrying case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V7WUFTG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)",5,1,2016-12-30,1,0,0

Fantastic value for the price. Plays much louder than the Outdoor Tech Turtle Shell 2.0 or the JBL Flip (first gen). Mid and high clarity from all three are equally impresssive. The OontZ seems to fill the room better maybe due to the angled drivers or the greater volume. Turtle Shell and Flip have a slightly deeper bass response but with speakers this size it's kind of a moot point because none are going to shake the room. And A+ for easy open and mostly environmentally friendly packaging. Came in a cardboard box and the only plastic was the bags for the cord and the speaker itself.,5,1,2016-12-5,1,0,0
For being a little speaker that you can put in your pocket this thing works awesome.  I use it almost daily for an hour or so and barely ever have to charge it.

Relatively distortion-free to high volume with remarkable bass & sound quality for its small size.  No rattles/break-up at high volume.  Very good podcast (voice) clarity, great music quality per dollar price.  Good charge life.  Handling shower spray well so far (I'm careful.) Range 15-ish feet (sometimes 20'--max) with iPhone.  One Chinese product that really works as advertised and appears to have some solid engineering in it.

I actually just ordered a replacement jam rewind,  and received it a few hours earlier than the oontz angle 3 which I just received now. Shipping was fast and amazing as always. Thank you again Amazon for hassle free ordering.  The minute I started playing music from the angle 3 I lost all interest in the jam rewind. Lol. Bottom line is you will not find a better sounding speaker of its size for $25!! Cambridge has outdone themselves on form factor, price, and distortion free listening even with bass heavy beats.

I would also like to see a longer cord for charging since the cord is about 6 inches long.",4,1,2017-5-22,1,1,0
VERY GOOD PRODUCT,5,1,2020-7-29,1,2,0
I regularly drop this speaker and it still sounds as great as it did the day I bought it. It's a great personal speaker but if you're having an event I highly recommend getting a big speaker. It does very loud on Bluetooth and through the aux. My only issue with this speaker is sometimes the Bluetooth acts weird with some phones and will register the phone as far away having the music glitch even if the phone is within 2 feet of the speaker just inside a pocket.,5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"I take is as a mini-speaker connecting to my laptop on the desk. So I do not concern about its battery life. The sound is good enough for regular use  EXCEPT when the volume is low. Sometimes I like to lower the volume, like in the night when everyone is sleeping. The low-volume sound is somehow replaced by a periodic white noise. It sounds like someone is whispering every 5 seconds. So if you would like to play it outdoor and out of loud, it should be totally fine. If you would like to take it as a desk speaker, which may not be the best application of it, you may think of it further.",4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"My OontZ bluetooth speaker arrived promptly and carefully packaged from Cambridge Soundworks.  The OontZ Angle 3 is just as advertised, but the music reproduction from its two speakers is immensely better than I expected.  It can fill a room with great sound as well as murmur quietly at my bedside.  The remote control feature is quite convenient and the battery long-lived as advertised.  I unreservedly reccomend seller and product.  You can find this on Amazon at:",5,1,2016-4-15,1,0,0
I bought this speaker to take with me on trips.  It fits easily into a day pack and provides a lot of sound for a small unit.  It has been very convenient to have in a variety of outdoor and indoor settings.  I liked it enough to buy a few more for my family as presents.,5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
I have had this product for over a month and half now and am beyond satisfied. I use for my as my wireless blue-tooth speaker on my pc and for my phone when I'm doing house work/cooking or working out. The sound quality is astonishing and I have nothing wrong to critique over it. The design of the speaker is also great to use because its small enough to put in your backpack and you can also use its design to keep your phone sort of standing. I have no problems with the battery life and I use daily and for at least 2 hours everyday. Also go with the Red colored one! It's bright enough to spot if you misplace it! 10/10 beyond satisfied!,5,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker thinking it would be an upgrade from my last speaker, it was not. Here's why.Really short charging cord, maybe 9 inches long, also the cord pops out of the charging port at the slightest nudge so most of the time you think it's charging, it probably isn't.",2,1,2017-6-22,1,1,0
"Incredible sound for such a small speaker. Great clarity.  I purchased the OontZ Angle 3 for personal listening and not window shattering sounds.

For $20.00, it's a great buy.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"Oontz has to have the WORST PRODUCT, PRODUCT WARRANTY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE POLICY!!!I have stuck by this brand faithfully for a year and a half, and while their initial sound quality is good, their BT connectivity and product sustainability after six months, is deplorable. This would have been my third replacement of the Oontz angle, and instead of Oontz being apologetic and perhaps even offering an upgrade on an obviously deffective line, I was told to stop contacting their customer support email, and that after replacing the product twice already, this time around, they wanted to charge me $7, and when I objected to the cost, I was told that they had already gone out of their way for me, and I'm left on the hook. I hope Amazon appreciates companies like this, bringing their name down. Thanks",1,1,2018-8-27,1,0,0

This didn't happen at first, but it occurred maybe 2-3 months after I purchased this?

"Device turns itself off within a few minutes of use if it is  not plugged in.  It also resets the volume too high when a new song comes on. Having a bluetooth speaker helps me to focus when I am studying. I use it to listen to Pandora while doing homework.  Since I am in the Masters program, my homework can be very challenging. Having this added distraction makes my homework even more frustrating. This is counterproductive for me, and I really wish that I could return it in exchange for something that works better!",1,1,2019-7-17,1,1,0

"Highs are crsip. Mids are weak. Bass doesn't thump, it taps, and when it does, all other sound is compromised.  Most of the 'stock' photos are misleading as to the size of the speaker.  It's been photoshopped onto them.  The speaker is shorter than the the length of my hand.  I like the small size but the sound leaves me wanting more.",3,1,2019-5-24,1,0,0
Man I really wanted this to be a good review but the only good thing about this product is the battery life. The sound quality is terrible. If you listen to anything with sound below 350hz this speaker is unable to reproduce it. The mids and highs are mediocre but the lows are inaudible. I paid $20 and I feel as though I was ripped off. At least I can listen to half of my music with low fidelity for a long time though 😊.,2,1,2018-7-5,1,0,0
"I have been a true music enthusiasts for over 35 years and have heard the likes of Harmon Kardon, Bose, Polk Audio and several other top of the line companies but I tell you what this little piece of magic that Cambridge SoundWorks has put together in the OontZ angle 3 speaker is truly amazing and something special. The phenomenal sound quality you get from this little jewel is amazing. I  have never heard such crisp highs and tight bass come from a speaker of this size ever snd not to mention that it's water resistant and comes with a built-in mic for phone calls. The price point couldn't be any better for what you get in this bundle of joy. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys listening to music on a professional level and I have already purchased three more to give to my children because they tried to take mine once they heard it.... That's sooooo much Cambridge SoundWorks for a outstanding product",5,1,2017-2-15,1,0,0

"First of all, everything is a compromise. This is a quite small speaker, but feels well made and much higher quality than many others in this price and size range. Does it sound like my little Bose model, not even close. But it is 1/3 the price, smaller and lighter too. Is it acceptable for basic listening? Yes. Not exactly hifi with minimal bass, but what can you expect from something this small? For the money and size, I am very pleased. One little issue, it refused to connect via Bluetooth to my phone the first time. I had to hold down the connect/power button for 5 seconds or so to reset it for a different device ( per the instructions) and then it worked fine.",4,1,2016-1-6,1,0,0
"I was pleasantly surprised at the audio from this thing. Loud, but more importantly, thicker and fuller sound, with sufficient mid range and bass considering its size. I am an audio engineer and I can't stand listening to bad gear because eventually it distorts our reality of sound. And quality like that is going down on most audio stuff these days, starting with mp3s to the lousy speakers and headphones we listen and tolerate these days. For minor stuff, this speaker gets the job done. Again, considering the size, it puts out good, (almost) balanced sound. I would take this over most of the JBL flips, and Logitech UE. The UE does pump more volume, however, the sound is not as clean.",5,1,2015-12-12,1,0,0

I'm a mechanic in a large open shop and the volume is high enough that the sound is clear and no distortion and can be heard from across the building. Pretty good speaker I'd say.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"Purchased the Oontz Angle 3 to pair with my iPad Air 2 for camp and travel playing downloaded Napster files. The sound will fill a small room with detailed treble, midrange, and bass. The bass is not boomy or chest-pounding; you are not going to get that effect with a speaker this small.  What you do get is a solid, detailed, and well-blended bass. For the purpose of context, I was listening to music that ranged from Eric Church to the Miles Davis quintet to the soundtrack ofLa La Land. I was surprisingly impressed with the musicality this inexpensive and small speaker could produce. Again, for context purposes, my computer speakers are small Audioengines. Although the Angle 3's do not produce as ""big"" a sound as the Audioengines, for travel purposes with the iPad I am impressed with Oontz Angle. In a large great room in a lodge, the Angle 3 will produce detailed ambient sound. It is not a party speaker.",5,1,2017-2-25,1,2,0
"This is an excellent speaker! I honestly didn't have much expectation of this product since I have not bought a Bluetooth speaker before, but I wanted something to amplify the music from my phone. This went above and beyond! This speaker had crystal clear sound quality, it has a decent amount of bass for a small speaker and it is  REALLY loud if your want it to be. Even turning it up all the way (which in my opinion was very, very loud. couldn't talk over it or hear anything over it at all ) and the music quality was still just as good at full volume. It's also easy to use and connected to my phone in seconds with no problem. Will probably get another, it's a great little speaker.",5,1,2017-11-13,1,0,0

It was very easy to pair up the speaker to the wireless transmitter. The speaker is small with its' own volume control and fits well on my treadmills consul or on a close by book shelf.  I was very surprised at how good the sound quality is and how loud I can make it.  Once the winter is gone I will experiment with it on my outside porch and boat.

The bass and treble is on point and the volume is incredible, I couldn't think of a normal situation where this isn't more than loud enough.

These are the only bluetooth speakers I've ever had so I can't compare, but what really sucks about these is that the charge doesn't last long and the charging cord is very finicky--I use this most often as my speaker for white noise when I sleep and leave it plugged in the whole time. More often than not, it just turns off in the middle of the night. Not sure why, but you get what you pay for I guess?",3,1,2018-7-24,1,0,0
"We thought this would be bigger than it was but are still happy with how it sounds for its size.

"Simple and easy to use. It sounds very loud and very low, in both scenarios the sound is clear I like the feature that the volume is independent from the Bluetooth volume. The one I'd like it to have is to be able to pair with other oontZ speakers. In addition, the battery lasts for ever. I've used in a acceptable volume for a whole evening with my family enjoying music. As a matter of fact, I have stopped using the big radio and is now used only for big parties.The only con I have found is that the microphone pickups a lot of sound of the environment when I'm using for calls, but well that's an extra feature. Main objective is for hearing music.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

"I purchased this to be a speaker in our upstairs bathroom.  Since it's in a bathroom near water, I liked the waterproof feature.  I've been using this for a couple months now and have been very pleased.  The speaker connected to my Android phone right away with no issues.  The sound quality is good.  Exactly what I would expect at this price point.  Will it compete with a $300 Sonos, abolutely not, but that's not what was intended.  The speaker is legitimately loud.  When you get the speaker to max audio, the sound quality degrades, but it still sounds good and loud when not pushed to it's max.One area that has been surprising is battery life.  I only listen to this for 20 minutes a day or so, but the battery seems to last a really long time.  I have only charged this device once since I bought it.  I keep going into the bathroom expecting the speaker battery to be dead, but it's not.  It just keeps going.  Maybe my expectations were low, but it has exceeded them in that category.",5,1,2015-12-15,1,0,0
"I was skeptical that something so small could produce such amazing sound. Keep in mind, I'm not a speaker connoisseur. I just want something that gets loud, doesn't get crackly, and sounds decent. This speaker works well with those things in mind.We have an older Suburban, so instead of spending money on a new sound system, we just use this in the Suburban full time. It gets plenty loud for our needs.",5,1,2016-8-15,1,1,0

"i am writing this review in regards to the customer service i experienced with cambridge soundworks.  I purchased this product as a gift for my girlfriend.  we were very impressed with its performance at first, however, after a couple of days there was a noticable sound distortion which grew worse with time.  this prompted me to message cambridge and notify them of the issue.  they responded immediately and asked me to do a quick reset, (about two min) when this did not fix the problem they did not hesitate to send me a brand new speaker with a 10 dollar carrying case at no extra charge.  the new speaker arrived quickly and has been performing excellently ever since.  i would definately do business with cambridge again.  in my opinion the reliability of a seller to stand by their product and value their customers speaks volumes.  cambridge soundworks was extremely polite and professional in all their dealings with me and there product has performed as advertized. i would recommend them to a friend with peace of mind any day.",5,1,2016-12-12,1,0,0

This speaker is so amazing! I am surprised by how cheap it is! It has survived many a beach trip so far and it is so simple to connect to a phone or iPod. Gets super loud compared to how small this speaker is. The battery also last forever! The first week I had it I played music for maybe an average of 3-4 hours each day and still didn't need to charge it! Kinda wish the charging cord was longer but it's compatible with my mom's Samsung cord so it's fine :) DEFINITELY BUY IT WHILE IT'S AT THIS PRICE!,5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
I bought this speaker because of the great reviews but I'm disappointed that I've had it for 4 months. It crackles too much making music garbled and phone calls impossible to do. This happens frequently. I give it a small tap which usually fixes it but I shouldn't have to do this. I think 2 stars is a fair rating since technically it works but overall not great.,2,1,2019-1-16,1,0,0

This product is great!!  It is so much better than using just my phone to listen to music!  I also like talking on the phone with it.  I just make sure that I am close enough to the microphone so that the other person can hear me.  The sound quality is amazing as well!  This could be used to make a house party come to life.  I love this product and couldn't imagine life without it.,5,1,2018-10-11,1,0,0
"As others have said, it produces more sound — and rich sound at that — than one would think possible. One caveat, there seems to be some occasional hiccuping when the auxiliary jack is used instead of blue tooth. Beats the heck out of me why, but I've had it happen with three different devices (phone, tablet, laptop). The same thing never happens with Bluetooth. This isn't anything to take away from the speaker. I'm assuming either a gremlin that lives on my desk or else something to do with the aux cable I have. Anyway, this is well worth the price.",5,1,2016-4-16,1,1,0

"This speaker covers the basics and does that well. The 'rich bass' claim is debatable - yes, there's some bass but whether or not it is ""rich"" is a different story (and the basic laws of physics just don't cover that for such a small device).Due to the small size you don't hear that it is stereo either - this is not a substitute for a real sound bar (and it is not intended to be used as one, so don't expect sound bar quality and features) .",3,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

"It's about the size of my Samsung Note 4. So don't think it will bass it's way across the room. It's more mid and highs. With that said, it is loud and clear. Impressive I must say because I got it for $20 one day deal. Side note...I remember the brand Cambridge from my younger days and they were considered then top notch. Glad to see them back.Update: Charging port was damaged and I contacted support. They were excellent in helping me out on my problem. Customer service is touch notch. Back to rocking this speaker again. Everyone that hear it are amaze the amount of volume that comes out of this little fella. Excellent battery life too. Thanks Cambridge, I look forward to getting the XL.",5,1,2015-11-25,1,0,0
"Got this for my wife to use in her motorhome. She likes music around the camp fire and this does a great job. It sits in her motorhome and is always charged. Small, lightweight, reasonable sound, and we won't feel bad if it gets lost, forgotten or damaged because the cost is low.",4,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"This works very well with the Amazon Echo Dot. It seems well constructed and feels sturdy. The connections seem water resistant, though getting the aux cable plugged in was a bit fiddly. I have it connected with said aux cable and the sound is very good for most things. I have noticed that it is a bit tinny sounding with any Rock-n-Roll and some other music. But, that has more to do with the limitations of a small portable speaker such as this. If you are looking for deep rich base sounds, get a real sound system. Shipping was fast.",4,1,2017-3-31,1,0,0
"I bought this to replace a beloved Jawbone costing 4 times as much that I left at a hotel. I was skeptical at first because of the lack of weight the Oontz had. I figured the weight of my Jawbone was because of the speaker magnets. Well. I can't do a side by side comparison, but I can see this little box rocks out and loud. First thing I did is blast ACDC ""Let there be Rock"" at full volume from my Galaxy Tab. No distortion but it danced around on the table like Angus Young. I'm so impressed I may someday by the bigger brother to this one. Ton of new bluetooth speakers out there now, this one does its job.",4,1,2016-5-28,1,0,0
"I've had this speaker for only 3 days, but bought it because the quality of sound of my friend's was so good I wanted one myself. My phone has morphed into my primary entertainment device, but of course it has a tinny speaker, and I don't like to wear headphones very often. This wee OontZ speaker sounds great! Jazz, industrial, opera, ambient, folk, big band, punk, goth, podcasts, meditations - it all sounds good. In these 3 days I've yet to charge it, though I'm probably pressing my luck by now. So glad I bought this. Now I can keep my phone out of the dangerous-to-gadgets kitchen and bathroom  and still have a sturdy speaker to listen to music.",5,1,2016-6-30,1,0,0

It's awesome, I take it out of the car and use it the next morning for a shower, I bring it back into the car. Rinse and repeat. It's been left out in sub 0 deg F temperatures, and it works just fine. Love it, now that I'm thinking about it, I might buy another.",5,1,2018-1-2,1,1,0
"Fantastic. We owned a SoundPal for about a year. It was okay, but we just couldn't hear it over any other noises. That became most appraent when we were installing flooring at a duplex by the freeway.  I'm pretty sure my phone's speaker was better. LOLThen, we bought the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle.  Dumbest name ever for the coolest little device. This thing is so small and it just bangs. If you turn it up all the way, you will probably turn it back down quickly. If you're looking for a good blue tooth speaker, this is the one. You cannot beat the quality, and the price.",5,1,2016-8-28,1,0,0

It worked great the first few days (it does drain the device battery quickly to use bluetooth), but in the last two days,my old phone (which I am using) has decided to balk at restarting the audiobook app. This isn't a fault of the Oontz, but my phone and/or software.

I really wanted a Bluetooth speaker that was inexpensive and this one is definitely that. But it's actually more than that. The sound quality is really great but I haven't been able to crank it up to test that yet. And I was really surprised by the look of it. It's much smaller than I imagined but I didn't look very closely at the pictures apparently. But I really like how sleek and small it is. It's actually pretty cute. Very simple  and clean. I'm really happy so far. Definitely super portable.The light indicators are nice and it paired on the first try no fuss at all with my iPhone.,5,1,2017-1-6,1,0,0
"When I bought this speaker a year ago, and at the time was worried thinking this would not be that loud.  It works great and has great sound.

Loved it so much I ordered another.  Quality is great for price and size.  Toss this in your bag for small picnics or tailgate.  So far this charges up and holds the charge.  I keep mine near the back door to hook my phone up while doing yard work or working in the garage.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  If you are trying to use as surround sound or for your TV . . . . I'm not certain.  But great addition for your electronic device.  Would make a nice stocking stuffer for teens!,5,1,2017-8-23,1,0,0
"Replaced another brand, it stopped working, with this one. I reviewed a lot of different BT speakers, and finally decided on this one. My wife likes it better than her older one, her old one was smaller and more $$. This is a great little speaker, the highs and mids are decent enough. No distortion at max level. Easy setup for my wife, she usually has me do it, she is not technologically savy. :) The lows are not as pronounced as a lot of the reviews stated, but still are not to bad for what you are getting, given the price ( which is very good).

I've had this Angle 3 for about 14 months now. This was a great buy for me and my needs. I highly recommend this small but powerful water proof blue-tooth speaker. The first speaker I received from Amazon arrived in a crushed package and it didn't power on. I contacted Cambridge SoundWorks and they sent me a replacement unit at no charge. It's been over a year and I have had only great experiences with my Angle 3. The battery still charges up quick and last forever. No leaks or issues with water or sand and it provides a nice deep bass sound from such a small speaker. I love the audio jack for my old school devices and the microphone is super handy when my hands are full because the speaker phone on mobile phones are crap. Overall I am very pleased with my speaker and will eventually look to buy a few more for gifts and the shower.,5,1,2017-6-6,1,1,0

Since she called me each time she wanted to connect it to her iPad, I know she didn't use it very often. The speaker itself still works, but the microUSB port for the charger is loose, and it's nearly impossible to get a connection long enough to charge the speaker. I wish I hadn't been trying to save a few bucks and gotten her a Jambox. I've had one for years and have never had a problem.

"I'm really surprised by this thing. For the cost, it's pretty robust. I am a woodworker and use this thing at work.

Dust hasn't bothered it so far and I use it several times a week, if not daily. Bluetooth is average and slow to connect if you don't have phone permission enabled. I'd call this a great buy,",5,1,2018-5-22,1,0,0

It sounds better than my old dock that was about 5 times as big. Controls are very easy to use. Once it was synced with my phone, I just hold the power button for a second to turn it on and I'm good to go. I have even taken phone calls on it and was able to use that feature without problem. It's only been a couple weeks so I can't say for sure on the water resistance in the bathroom, but it seems to be doing fine.

I've been using this speaker at work for about 2 weeks. I work in a bakery and there is a lot of noises around like the oven and mixers. This speaker does great for music and podcasts that I listen too. It doesn't have much bass if at all but thats fine I don't need it. Depending on where it's placed you can get some bass but don't bet on it too much. The sounds are pretty clear with music and podcasts and it can get pretty loud. I never have it at top volume even when I use it in my backyard. The battery life is good and it lasts about 12 hours like it says at 50 to 75% volume.

I love the fact that its got Bluetooth and line in aux capabilities and it is very easy to travel with because of its such a convenient size. The Battery life is phenomenal!!!!! I have gone several days without charging it after heavy use, and when I do have to charge it up to full the wait is not that long.The only negative thing I have to say about this product is: I have had this speaker a little over a year and a half now, and I take very good care of my belongings. while the internal components, sound quality, and functionality of the speaker have never waived or depreciated the external case of the speaker is becoming warped loose and beginning to fall apart. which is a shame because the esthetic of this speaker is another thing I love about it. it just looks cool!!!",5,1,2017-12-24,1,0,0

Simple to use, small and portable, perfect for a nightstand or even around the yard, garage etc.,  This thing is plenty loud and sounds fantastic.  Was doing some work around the house and took it with me to each room and was so impressed with it, I figured I would write a review.  Im buying another one for my desk at work.  Simply impressive for its size and price! Buy this!",5,1,2018-1-7,1,0,0
"Great product for a low price. I bought this speaker because I wanted a Bluetooth speaker that was good quality, but not as expensive as the JBLs. I also wanted decent bass which the the Oontz provides. Oontz 3 is pretty loud when turned all the way up, which makes it a great pick for the poolside or hanging with friends at a bonfire. This speaker is not overly bulky and is easy to carry around. I like that the sides have a rubbery feel so that it grips the surface it sits on and your hand.Cambridge sound works also provides great customer service. My first speaker was damaged in shipping and they provided me a replacement in a timely manner.",5,1,2016-7-5,1,0,0
We have had one in three past that lasted forever until it was stolen from my son. This one worked great for about a month and then started to run out of battery really fast. A total bummer because the sound quality is pretty decent. Now it’s not really usable.,2,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"Wow!  What a small package for such a powerful 10 watt speaker!  The other cool thing is my hubby called me just as I had paired it with my phone and the microphone is really powerful as well and we were able to carry on a conversation through the speaker, crystal clear!Cambridge Sound, you hit this one out of the park!",5,1,2019-3-30,1,0,0
"Portable speaker used for audio in a small classroom.  Note that this can be held in one hand, so it's not a big booming thing, but it does well for most classical music.  I wouldn't try it with Also Spracht Zarathustra, though.  Set it on a wooden table for best bass reproduction.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"We love this little Bluetooth speaker! We paid $28 and it feels like a great value. It holds a charge well and connects easily to all of our devices. The sound is really nice, it even has some good bass. The size is perfect, and the small footprint means we can find space for it anywhere we go. The only (very minor) drawback is that, since it is 100% black and a perfect triangle, it can be hard to find buttons or which corner is up if the lighting is poor. I've occasionally set it down with the speaker on the bottom, or had to turn on a light to find the volume buttons.",5,1,2017-2-10,1,0,0
"Man what’s there to say very impressed!! I actually compared to one of my coworkers Bose. His Bose was a bit lower  just bassier, while on the other hand this one to me was more balanced sound wise more clearer great sound. Would definitely recommend this Bluetooth to anybody that doesn’t wanna break the bank and get a decent Bluetooth for the price you definitely wont be disappointed... I actually ordered a second one.",5,1,2019-9-18,1,1,0
Amazing how well these things sound. I've had a few but the batteries have a hard time holding a charge after awhile. This sounds really good for it's size. I see these for a LOT more and I'm not sure why I'd pay that much. I think all will have issues holding a charge after awhile. My daughter stole this one and uses it in her dorm now so I'll need another one. She takes it out when she lays in the sun and about anywhere else,5,1,2018-3-28,1,0,0
I really wasn’t expecting this speaker to be so good for the price. We live in a studio and it pretty much makes it sound like there’s surround sound and the quality is pretty great. I can’t say I have anything to compare it to and I’m not an audiophile by any means but overall it sounds pretty crisp with clear bass. I also love the look of it (sleek and edgy)! Very worth the price!,5,1,2018-12-29,1,0,1
"You can NOT beat this little wonder for price/performance. I just got it, it is literally rockin. Sure, it could use more bass, but it is filling the 12' x16' room with sound - nice highs and mid. As I type this I can literally feel the low end as it ports out the bottom.As a speakerphone - it has some delay which causes 'talk-over', but otherwise, it's a great product.I am really surprised.",5,1,2016-12-1,1,1,0
"I bought this little speaker for my 2008 Miata convertible, which of course doesn’t have Bluetooth and the sound system has seen better days.  The sound is loud and clear even with the top down.  I can make and answer calls successfully, but I bought it for the ability to hear music, and I couldn’t  be happier for the price.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
Decent sound and easily portable.  Bluetooth connection is terrible. It is nowhere near 100 ft. and easily disrupted. Put the speaker 15-20 feet distance from desktop and it may or may not stay connected. Walk between speaker and computer the connection is gone. Forget about putting it in another room.,2,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"This was quite the surprise. As an audiophile, I put each sound source in its proper perspective. This is NOT a JBL 15"" loudspeaker. The bass is not thumping and your ears will not b shaken. But for the little speaker you see physically, you will be pleasantly surprised by the clear sound this little workpony puts out. The base is audible (which is more than I can say for other Bluetooth speakers of this size); for me this means you can clearly make out the intro to ""I'm Ready"" by Kano. You can get loud enough to entertain on a small outdoor patio, or a small group gathered around at the park. Of course, the bass is MUCH better on a solid foundation than on, say, like grass. I cannot believe how long the battery lasts. I don't know if it will last for hours a year from now, but right now I can go at least 8 or more on a single charge at about 70% volume (of my phone). I actually had to charge my phone! first!. This was definitely worth the investment.",5,1,2016-1-11,1,0,0
"I bought this to replace a different speaker that broke. I love how much louder it is than my previous speaker. It seems to me very well made, with sturdy materials, but it is still very lightweight. It syncs with my phone effortlessly. I also love that it can be used inside the shower (only with minor splashing) as I am sure this is how my last speaker broke. I can listen to my podcasts in the shower, though it must be turned up very loud to hear the voices clearly. I suspect that this is an issue with the sound engineering of the podcasters than the speaker. The loudness is a pro and a con. It's sufficient enough for a small gathering, but It can get so loud that it can be disturbing to roommates in the morning. I guess I'll just have to get my own place that much sooner. All on all this is a great little speaker for the price.",5,1,2016-4-3,1,0,0
AT FIRST...Absolutely great little speaker I loved it so much I bought my mom one so she can work out in her living room ...but when I pulled it to her house the other day I heard it from outside!! She's gone crazy hahaha. We both love it! ....Then 32 day later ...ALL OF A SUDDEN IT STOPS WORKING... 2 DAYS PAST RETURN DATE😒... NOW IM NOT SURE IF ITS WORTH ONLY 1 MONTH OF USE,5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"Sound quality isn't bad for how small this thing is. I've used this thing outside while working in the yard, used it in the bathroom while I shower, and in my room when studying or working. I use this thing as often as I can, which is why I have Ben able to charge it once every 2 days and still holds a decent charge. Bass is pretty good, but volume can become distorted at higher volumes. I usually keep my phone volume at about 80% and keep the speaker at about 2/3 max volume. Pretty loud for what I need it for. Wish battery lasted longer, would be my only complaint.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I'm usually a bit hesitant to write reviews, (I don't want my opinion to be the one to dissuade someone from buying something that will provided them with just they're looking for, or encourage them to buy something that they don't truly want), but I had to say something about this speaker.I held off on buying this speaker because at its price point I didn't expect it to offer decent sound. I was going to hold off and buy a better brand (JBL, Harmon Kardon) so that I would have a great sounding speaker.I decided to go cheap and buy this one because it had decent reviews, and I wanted something cheap for the garage. Boy was I wrong!",4,1,2017-7-3,1,1,0
It is a well built device. But it sounds a bit tinny and sound appears to come from a tunnel. Bass response is not great.Also it lacks control to skip to next/previous track.I don't want to reach for the phone to change the track!,3,1,2017-11-27,1,1,0

"Introducing new technology into my wife is and has always been a challenge, she does not adopt easily.  Without boring everyone with details, I was impressed with the sound quality so started to use it for my own use.

Quality of sound is good just not very loud and yes, I turned up the volume to full max on the devices it was paired with. I like the style of it, not too big and not too small.  I can't comment on battery life because I'm returning due to the low volume.",2,1,2018-12-6,1,0,0

My own petty grievances as follows the rubbery surface on the edges is annoying, it picks up a lot of dust, and I don't know how much better it serves in protecting this well made case as it is.

Better than midline name brand response, but not mind blowing.

Surprisingly loud speaker for its size and made for a great picnic speaker. It has reasonable range and continued playing from the other side of my 2 car garage. Usually used it in the shower or on a boat and it still works so I believe the water resistance. Play button doesn't function like the play button on the headphones.Seems like a minor gripe but it bothered me to no end when I wanted to skip a song in the shower but couldn't. I got so frustrated that I eventually gave up and bought a JBL flip 2. Battery life on the oontz is maybe half of that of the JBL. Feels like 4-5 hours on the Oontz but I haven't measured exactly.,4,1,2016-10-15,1,0,0
I was blown away by the fast no questions asked return. The first Oontz was defective the cord would not fit for anything!

I use this to stream the radio in the morning while getting ready for work.  Perfect for sitting on the sink outside the shower and has a suprising volume to it!

Its easy to see why it sells so well.,5,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"I had my doubts when I bought this. I thought it wouldn't be that loud, or have any good bass. I was very wrong. This things ""bumps"" as the kids say, with bass that far exceeds what you would expect out of this thing. Does it sound like a subwoofer? Of course not, but it does have a pleasantly deep bass for what it is. Bluetooth works great with my android phones, for some reason shows up on iPhones ok the first time, but never shows again after they disconnect- had this happen to a few friends so I'm biased against it being user error. That said, I have an android so I'm not knocking it down.",5,1,2016-6-30,1,0,0

"Works well. Replaces an AmazonBasics Ultra-Portable Nano Bluetooth Speaker which I could never quite hear above the noise of shower water and that started glitching after a couple of weeks. This speaker is ""hear-able"" above the sound of running water. Have had it for a short time now, but so far so good. Pairs well with the bluetooth device (iPad). Automatically detects the pairing when turned back on. Amplifies my iPad volume to a volume much louder than the iPad alone would be capable of producing. If it performs well over the long-term - then I'd say this is an excellent option for anyone seeking a water resistant speaker.",5,1,2016-1-21,1,0,0

I was blown away by the sound quality- with my volume turned all the way up it sounded throughout the entire house without flaw or scratchiness- and by the simple and easy set up. I didn’t even look at the directions to figure it out and it’s super simple, obvious, and dummy proof. I love that it comes with the audio adapter AND the Bluetooth ability.

Connecting the bluetooth to my Macbook Pro was as smooth as butter on lobster. Usually, cheap technology takes forever to pair with bluetooth, so that was also a pleasant surprise. It's super tiny and adorable, and I like how inconspicuous it is. The sound is amazing for normal humans who have no experience in the audio world. It sounds crisp and clear to me and will work perfectly for my shower concerts. I'm still testing the battery life, so I don't know how long one charge really lasts, but 4 stars for it already being fully charged.",5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,1
Great sound for a little speaker. Very satisfied. The packaging was overkill though. The speaker is maybe 6-7 inches at best but the box they shipped it in was ginormous! At least a couple feet long. I couldn't remember what I had ordered that was so big. I opened the box and had to search for the speaker among all the packing paper. Ridiculous. Could have used a much smaller box.,5,1,2016-12-1,1,2,0
"I was skeptical of the reviews, but this tiny speaker packs a punch. The sound is surprisingly really good. The mids are well defined and has proper amount of fidelity for a rich, balanced sound.

They seem to be sturdy, hold a decent charge, connect effortlessly via Bluetooth, play quite loud for their size, and generally do what they are advertised to do.  As the old adage proclaims- you get what you pay for- and it's true here, except maybe you get even a bit more.

"Bought this for iPhone music in my non-Bluetooth equipped Pathfinder. Sounds fine, compact size, pretty good non-slip on the dash. My only complaint is that I frequently have to reboot my 6S to get the speaker to connect. As this is a situation covered in the Troubleshooting section of the manual, I suspect it is an endemic issue, but isn't a major inconvenience to me.Coincidentally the 12/17 issue of Long Island Newsday (Fanfare section I think) reviewed the Angle very positively.",4,1,2017-12-18,1,0,0
I had a first generation OontZ that stopped bluetoothing so I wanted a new one. This one is more user friendly and better control of volume on the unit itself. Connects great with my new iPhone. Very pleased to have this while gardening.,5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"This was a gift for my husband. It's awesome! We use it outside for BBQs and I have a two year old so when it says it's water safe, it definitely is. Not waterproof so I wouldn't drop it in a bucket of water but it can get wet without any damage. This is a great stereo. My husband turns on his Bluetooth and it syncs right up to the stereo. It's very easy to use and surprisingly does not run out of battery very quickly. He uses it almost daily and was a great gift. I also got the neoprene case that goes on it and I'm glad I did. It keeps it safe from little hands. Great gift, I would buy it again",5,1,2016-7-28,1,0,0

"Sound quality is okay. No problems with bluetooth pairing. However, the bummer I've repeatedly encountered is to return to the unit only to find the battery with extremely low charge.

Definitely a major bummer... would not purchase again.",3,1,2018-10-9,1,0,0

I’ve been using this speaker for 3 weeks now and I like it :) for the price and size it has good quality. Nothing extraordinary loud of course BUT it has plenty of sound for a room or bond fire or even small gathering. The battery is decent too. I play at FULL sound and find it lasts 4-6 hours for me off the charger. It’s been holding up well. Good purchase.,5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,1

"I don't know if this is a horrible speaker or if I just received a lemon... It never worked from the start. The on/off button worked 30% of the time so I could never turn it off after I was done using it, so it would always die just from being left on. If I wanted to use it again, I would have to plug it in to charge and wait because it won't play while it's charging. The speaker quality was good when it worked, but the product as a whole was very unreliable. I didn't return the speakers because I have an extremely busy schedule and returns have become such a hassle with Amazon.  It doesn't seem worth it to pay for shipping to return a product that doesn't work. I was especially disappointed in this product since I bought it because my family was visiting and I wanted to have some nice background music throughout the trip, but it rarely ever worked. The only reason I'm giving this speaker 2 stars is because the sound quality was good when it worked.",2,1,2017-4-20,1,1,0
"Got this as a Christmas gift 2016. Worked great. Good sound quality. Battery life was good. Not great, but I can't complain. It's now June 2017, and yesterday it is dead. Will not charge. Will not turn in. Just dead in the water. Just sitting in a dash compartment, and I thought it was drained down on battery. Went to charge, charge light didn't illuminate. Tried multiple chargers. From rapid car charger to at home charger. Nothing worked. I genuinely thought well if this speaker. Portable, small, but good sound. Now this. I wanted to give it a 4 star review, but with this, I am being nice and giving it a two. If it doesn't last 6 months, then it not worthy, but I did enjoy it. Very disappointed",2,1,2017-6-30,1,1,0

"Bought three of these based on Amazon recommendation, and everyone is happy with these small speakers.  The sound is relatively good for the size of speaker, and I love the speakerphone (aka hands free) capability for having phone conversations.  The splash proof design is good for use in wet environments like a bathroom, and the easy to use volume adjustments mean that you don't have to use change it on the source device if you don't want to.

I know it's a sub $30 speaker, but I have an old Canz brand speaker from 6 or 7 years ago that sounds comparable. The bluetooth connects up good and the battery life is good.

"Sound quality is great. Construction is solid. Worthwhile purchase for the price. Battery life and times between charges is adequate. Downsides: length of the USB charging cord is a joke. What were they thinking? How much could the company make or gain by making a cord less than 12"" long! Really! Another downside: I thought you could purchase multiple speakers and ""string"" them together and have all play the same songs or streaming in different rooms of my house. Wrong! Only one can be played at a time, due I assume, to bluetooth frequency limitations or else they cheaped on this as well. Look elsewhere if you want that feature.

I wouldn't call myself an audio enthusiast or anything, but as an average everyday user, I only have positive remarks about this product.I also want to mention the great customer support.

It may be small, but it is mighty - I use it mostly in my bathroom, and not only is the volume way more than I would ever need, but the sound quality is better than I would have believed it could be - the bass notes sound like something from a much larger speaker. And for the price? You can't get a better Bluetooth speaker!",5,1,2018-9-16,1,0,0
The sound is great for the price and the battery life is great. The sides are silicone and pick up dust quickly but are easy to clean.

Even if I'm re-upping yearly, they still are coming out with a new models at a price to keep me coming back.The only criticism is that in every one thus far, what has failed has been the micro-usb plug. Just cause the little guys bounce around so much and that usb plug becomes the pivot point, the connections to the circuit board wear out over a year or so and break off. A good way to improve the design is to have the microusb connected to the circuit board via wires so it can float in a harness pushing it through the shell.",4,1,2017-3-3,1,2,0

"Very good sound.  Great volume.  Speakers capture the high sounds such as cymbals and they do a good job of capturing the low bass as well.  You can control the volume from the speakers, but unfortunately there are no back and forth buttons so you can not toggle back and forth through your playlist.  Also, I find that if you move the speaker from one spot to another there is sometimes some skipping or static that occurs, but once the speakers are stable again they quickly recapture the signal and are back to normal.  Perhaps all wireless speakers are prone to this --  I am not sure.  Lastly, when I initially set up the speakers the sound that was coming out of them was awful.  I'm guessing the software needed a minute to stabilize or do its thing or whatever.  At any rate, after a minute or two and a reboot, the speakers worked fine and I have not had a problem since.  Overall I am extremely happy with these speakers and highly recommend them.",4,1,2016-5-28,1,0,0

Hence the research and purchase of the OontZ Angle. We took it to Puerto Rico and went to the beach daily with it - zero issues or worries. Always cleaned right up.

Therefore, if the source is in one room and the speaker is in another, it may not work because of the wall in between.  I would think that would be an important thing to tell a consumer before they buy the object.  Since my bluetooth earbuds aren't effected I would think the speakers could also work.

"Very convenient, good-looking, and easy to use; however, sound quality is minimal.  It also doesn't get all that loud, but it's loud enough for most purposes.  If you're creative, and you place it in the right location in the room, natural room acoustics can improve its sound quality and volume quite a bit.  Its biggest uses in my opinion are (a) portability if you don't like your phone's built-in speaker, (b) good for lectures or anything else that doesn't depend on sound quality, and (b) it works really well as a shower speaker since it's waterproof and the acoustics of the typical shower help with the mediocre sound quality and low volume.",3,1,2018-5-10,1,0,0
"I bought this to play music for our dog when we are away. We leave it plugged in all of the time. It is easy to connect to and sounds great.

"This speaker is just what I needed. I was looking for something small to go in the kitchen so I can listen to music or podcasts while I cook/clean. This little guy can get so loud, yet it's profile is minimal. I got this as a gift for my co-workers years ago for the workspace and they absolutely loved it. Finally got one for myself too :)",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"I'm not comparing here - i have no other context - but I've been happy with the sound quality, i keep it in a shower no problem, and it will play music from a device two rooms away. That's all I wanted and this does the job.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"For it's size, I was pleasantly surprised. I find it great in the bedroom. Sound quality is pretty good even on radio play. I would buy this product again and was very great ful that I could get it with such a great deal through Amazon. Also I got my package on time as usual. The downside is that although you can play the speaker while it's plugged in is not a good idea mainly cause the charger cord is unbelievably short. The stereo moves easily under a generous amount of volume causing it to tug at the recipical and eventually making charging impossible.",4,1,2016-9-19,1,0,0
"I carry this speaker with me everywhere. Battery seems to last forever, and the sound quality for music or audio book is good. The speaker does need to be relatively close, because the volume doesn't boom. Also, high kudos for customer service ...

"I rarely give 5 stars, but this product is totally awesome.  For the price I paid, I am totally satisfied.  I have purchased a few portable Bluetooth and wired speakers in the past and this product is top notch.  When I first tested it, I used it to hear sound from a video on my phone and the sound quality was amazing.  Afterwards, I connected it to my PC and played some DOLBY and THX videos.

I have another bluetooth speaker from Sony that I like but is not considered portable compared to the OontZ Angle 3.  This meets my needs completely.  The speakers are best for recreation, used in a large room for videos, music, and for additional sound.  The base is not the best, and don't expect concert hall quality.  For the price, it's a great portable speaker.",5,1,2016-9-29,1,0,0

"I’m frustrated with this speaker and would return it in a blink except I already discarded the box. After checking reviews this seemed like a good thing. Nobody mentioned that if you want to use it at your desk with your desktop computer that it would block your WiFi connection! I do a lot of work online and like to listen to music while researching. Additionally, the music sounds as if it’s being broadcast from the bottom of the ocean. Frankly I feel that the manufacturer deliberately omits the information that it blocks WiFi.",1,1,2018-9-5,1,0,0
"As others have said,  The sound is pretty good considering the price. It connects easily to my echo Dot and to my iPhone.

That’s a bit annoying, but maybe there’s a way to overcome that. Initial pairing  is easy.  It is probably loud enough to hear inside a vehicle, but you would need to secure it properly.",5,1,2017-10-24,1,0,0
"I bought this to use in the noisy, greasy kitchen I work in and out of as a server. It's loud enough to hear among the yelling and clanging of things, it sounds good despite being surrounded by stainless steel everything, and it sat (unknowingly) in a puddle of water for about two hours last night and still works. It seems that the lower it is physically the better the bass is. I had it over head at first, but then set it right on the stainless steel counter and was able to hear it kick a little more. Nothing like a couple of subs and an amp, but for the amount spent, Snoop was bumping good enough to keep me sane at work.",4,1,2017-9-15,1,0,0
"You can't beat this Bluetooth speaker for the price or size.  Small but reasonably powerful.  It is not going to sound as good as the $150 Bose or JBLs but if you like to stream movies on your iPad or laptop or even your phone, this compact, easy to travel with speaker is perfect.  Improves the viewing/listening pleasure tremendously.  UPDATE: Bluetooth connection crapped out after 15 months of limited use.  Still works with cable connection but kinda defeats the purpose",2,1,2016-9-4,1,1,0

"I was looking for a cheaper Bluetooth speaker since mine had recently stopped working. I really base most of my purchases from reviews and this one sounded like most people loved it so I decided to give it a try. BUY IT NOW!

"I like this bluetooth speaker.  I have one from another company that sounds good, but they use the same switch that changes the songs to adjust the volume, you just have to hold it rather that move & release. So every time you want to change the volume, you end up switching songs.This speaker isn't like that.  It has great sound quality, even at high volume.  It connects via bluetooth flawlessly.  Volume controls are perfect.  It has auto-off, when not in use.  The charge lasts quite a long time (although i have not timed it). It looks good, and appears durable enough for my application, which is in a woodworking shop.  I highly recommend.",5,1,2016-1-12,1,0,0

"I'm very happy with the sound and design.  I use it around water (but not in it), and it has still worked great.  It's a bit heavy/big, but I justify that by the sound quality.  My only complaint is the black buttons on a black device.  It's very hard to see the on/off button or volume controls.  In fact, they added a sticker on mine that points to the on/off button, which I've kept on there so I know.  If they change those to white, it would make it much better.",4,1,2017-9-8,1,0,0
"Speaker worked fine for a little over a month. Then, it began intermittently shutting off and not coming back on.

Your customer service is remarkable!",1,1,2018-5-18,1,0,0
I fully charged this and then set aside for a sunny day by the pool. Speaker won't turn on or sync with bluetooth. Set on charger again and charged overnight and still flashes red light indicating it's still charging. Should be charged by overnight and won't come on. Won't buy another Oontz product. Not worth sending back due to virus. Waste of money.,1,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
It was fine when I first got it but now I have to keep it plugged in. Battery life doesn’t really last long enough to leave it off charge for long (around 2 hrs). Not ideal for the original intention of camping. The sound is great. It does have some issues pairing sometimes. It’s usually solved with taking a break or charging it up completely.,2,1,2017-11-21,1,1,0

"After less than six months, whenever it was plugged in to charge it made a hissing noise for a few seconds then a pop.  At about the same time, the battery life dropped to near zero.

It still hisses when first plugged in, but now it won't turn on or even pair.As for the sound, It was lacking in Bass response of any sort. It was a tolerable cheap speaker, but I have now lost faith with anything made by Cambridge Soundworks.",1,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0

"It isn't the loudest speaker, but for my uses it works perfectly.  Most of the time I'm using this is outside doing yard work, or while I'm in the kitchen.  The bluetooth works pretty well, and the battery lasts 6+ hours regularly.  The only small issue I could say is that I wish it came with a wall charger instead of having to use the included USB cable to connect to another charger, which is more of a convenience issue for me than a performance or technical one.I'd recommend this as it was inexpensive, works well and is easy to use.",5,1,2016-11-3,1,0,0
This was a great purchase for the price. The ONLY reason I dinged a star is because the charging cable it comes with is usb only and also EXTREMELY short so if you want to plug it into a wall outlet for continuous use you need to get a usb wall adapter for it which thankfully I had spare of and also a longer usb charging cable as well. Also the 3.5 aux cable it came with is terrible quality and had very bad feedback when plugged in so I threw that out and got a longer higher quality one of those too. These things are important to me because I am using this speaker as a pairing for the echo dot that I use in my kitchen. The great news is after doing those things the speaker itself is pretty amazing and had much higher sound quality than it appears it can push out and it also can get really loud. Enough so that it can easily fill a room at max volume if you so desire. Bottom line is the speaker itself is great quality and built extremely well. The peripherals that it came with however are extremely cheap quality and you should just replace them if you need to use them. I would recommend this purchase however because the price is right and the problems are easily fixable and because i'm using this with my echo the fact that it always stays powered on when plugged in is a MUST HAVE feature for this as you need your speaker to always be on for the echo and not have a forced auto shut off like most other bluetooth speakers do even when plugged in. This one however will always stay on as long as it is plugged into a power source making it invaluable for things like this. So yea great purchase would buy again if need be.,4,1,2016-11-27,1,6,0

The controls are on the side for Bluetooth, volume and play/pause. The power button is located on the back, above the nice and tightly concealed charging port. I noticed the light on for the Bluetooth, and paired my phone. It connected immediately, and for a moment the feedback went away, but came back right away.

Thanks to a surprise thunderstorm, it was extrememly wet, but never submerged.I like this speaker and use it more than i thought i would. The sound quality is acceptable with just enough low end to keep it from sounding thin.  Don't expect big speaker sound here.  Battery life is good. I used it for about 6 hours at high volume with no sign of going dead.  The styling is fairly generic looking, but feels extremely durable.

I just wanted a speaker for my amazon dot that I could plug in and charge and use like that and still be able to take it with me to the beach if I chose to do so. I was surprised to find how hard this actually was as most speakers can't be used while charging.However I was even more surprised how well this sounds for being a smaller thing.  The sound is great and well worth what I paid for it.,5,1,2016-11-13,1,3,0
"We've had this for several weeks now and I am still caught off guard by both the sound quality and volume this device is capable of. This device will not disappoint no matter your intended application. Battery life is astonishing, range and bass quality is excellent, and the volume is positively room filling. I am still not quite sure how physics allows this device to do what it does.",5,1,2019-4-15,1,0,0
"Well so far this has been a strong powerful speaker for my 19 yr old. I didn’t want to spend to much since he breaks, miss places things as all teenagers do. But also not complicated to use or charge up, nice and small.Perfect for him. I would purchase again.",5,1,2018-8-13,1,1,0
We love using this connected to our laptop when we watch shows or conferences. Laptop sound cannot do the sound that this sweet speaker can. We purchased it at least 2 years ago. It's still going strong! We love it.,5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"The product provides decent sound for the price but it's hardly awesome.  I would characterize it as a more rich sound than the built in speakers on my Mac Pro but nowhere near something like Bose S1.  Again, for the price this product is compelling.",4,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"I love this little speaker...the sound is crisp and loud (if you want). I use it in my office and the important thing here is that the notification is a quiet little tune...not a loud ""SPEAKER ON/BATTERY LOW/SPEAKER OFF"" notification scaring the others I work with. Honestly, that is why I love it more than any other speaker I've had.  However, the charging port or cord stopped working, so I wrote Cambridge and asked for their help as it was only a month old. They sent me a brand new one, free of charge, and it arrived in 3 days!!! This company's customer service is second to none! No questions, no hassle, no ""return and we'll fix it""...just a brand new one sent to me immediately. Outstanding!!",5,1,2018-3-31,1,0,0
"I really like this speaker. I have used a lot of different Bluetooth speakers and this one is my favorite so far. The sound quality is very good. The charge lasts a long time.  My only complaint is the location of the power button which is a little hard to find in the dark.  I listen to books at night, so I would prefer it did not shut off automatically when it is being used, but I suspect most people would like this feature. It also helps with battery life.  Overall, I highly recommend this Bluetooth speaker",5,1,2017-12-18,1,0,0
I got two of each color these speakers were available.  I teach dance classes. Students are always in need of a speaker to run their music.  I couldn't afford to spend a ton of money to get speakers but the review were good for this speaker so I took a chance.  They worked great.  The students told me they were shocked at how loud they were.  Syncing was too easy.  The speakers were syncing to phones and then we had to switch the speakers around.  My students were very happy that I finally get these speakers.  Wish they came in green and yellow.,5,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"We bought this speaker mainly to use for brief intervals in the shower (morning podcasts, music, etc.).  It does its job well and so far I'm very impressed with the battery life.  Obviously I don't care too much about perfect sound quality for a shower speaker, but volume is good and it's very easy to use.  Quite happy with this purchase so far - will update if something changes.",5,1,2018-11-4,1,0,0
"This sound on this speaker is really good but the Bluetooth connection is very disappointing, you really have to stay close in order to get a good connection, if you move more than 10 feet away the contractions gets really bad.",3,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

"Worked beautifully ... for about a month. At that point it refused to charge. The charging light would light up when plugged in, but the speaker wouldn't turn on when removed from the cord.Update: Cambridge promptly replaced by failing speaker. The new one works beautifully. I'm updating the review to 4-stars now, and if the speaker proves to be reliable, I'll be back for another update. Thanks, terrific customer support.",4,1,2017-6-28,1,1,0
"By the way - I couldn't care less if it's cordless, I just wanted something across the room that was connected by bluetooth.  But these bluetooth speakers ALL seem to be cordless/rechargeable, run on batteries, which I didn't want.  I couldn't find definite info if keeping this charging all the time would, in effect, turn it into an AC powered device, so I took a chance.  It did work, I can keep it plugged in and running for days.",5,1,2016-10-16,1,2,0
I have to say I am very impressed with the quality of sound I get from the Oontz.  Sure a small speaker will lack the base booms but it more than makes up for that with it's great sound.  I have played  music for others and they were so impressed they want to buy one.  The battery charge seems to last a long time but I wish I could tell what the battery level actually is.  I certainly would recommend this to friends.,5,1,2015-11-20,1,0,0
This is my favorite speaker. I can hear it all over the house and it never loses my Bluetooth connection. The battery life is crazy long!!! I feel like I never charge it because the battery lasts forever.,5,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0
"I can't rave about this.  The overall sound is just okay on it.  Connectivity and battery life are good.  For what it is and the price it is fine, just don't expect you are getting a super high quality device with great sound.",4,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"There is a reason why this product has over 20k! The sound quality aren’t bad at all but feedback I got is that the bass could be better. If you turn the volume all the way up, the bass is kind of fading and cutting off but for the price you can’t compare with boss or beat. Very portable which is a plus since I can bring it to the beach on the family play date!",4,1,2018-9-16,1,0,0
"This is a great little speaker for the money.  Volume is just ok but all you can expect from a speaker this size.  It you want thumping bass ('bout that bass) with great voume, especially outdoors, this is probably not your speaker.  Oontz does make a larger speaker (with a larger price tag) that might be your cup of tea, but if you want a small, palm size speaker for a small room, this will do a respectable job.  Easy to pair (took less than a minute) and pairs automatically with my wife's I-phone when she turns it on.  Great features, easy to use, universal usb charging.  all you can ask for at this price.",4,1,2016-2-5,1,0,0
"Love the size and sturdiness of the speaker. It’s never died on me, lol, I just charge it to make sure it doesn’t every few weeks. Great sound and I love that it comes with a cable to hook up if the device doesn’t accept Bluetooth. Bluetooth is very easy to connect/pair.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"Bought this last xmas for my husband who NEEDS music while he showers- the sound quality is amazing, easy to pair, gets super loud, and the battery is insane.

"Very very very tinny ... no bottom end what so ever - not sure were the term ""bass"" comes from the web description - the design seems to be a two way design which is kinda interesting - or - do I just have a defective unit ? - anyway - keeping the unit as it's ""ok"" for what I need - something cheap & dirty in the bathroom when I'm in there ... can't recommend this particular unit as a primary sound source - yes it's cheap - but sadly - after reading & seeing all the reviews - thought I found a diamond in the rough ... meh not so much ...",3,1,2016-11-17,1,0,0
"Gave this Bluetooth speaker to my sister for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. She said it sounds great, better than a more expensive Name brand speaker she’s had for a couple of years. It made a great present, might even  buy one for myself.",4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I purchased this as a test to replace a Bose Soundlink Mini in my RV because the Bose had too minimal mid-and hi-range output at low volume for me. This OontZ has more of the mid & higher ranges, plus it can be charged with a USB cord - which functions great in a RV while boon docking (no 120 volt power). It is now in the RV full time. I can connect it with a cable to my Sirius radio and TV, or via Bluetooth to my phone or iPod.The Bose has moved into the shop where it can operate at a higher volume level, and with the required power supply.",5,1,2016-8-29,1,0,0
Was OK while it lasted. USB port became loose and then stopped charging altogether after less than a year. Found out only has 90-day warranty so out of luck. Won’t buy another.,1,1,2019-5-12,1,1,0
"I purchased this after reading the reviews. When I received it it was smaller than I thought. But after pairing it to my phone, very quick and easy to do, all I can say is WOW. The sound that comes out of this speaker is incredible. Very good fidelity, good base could be better but good for the size of the speaker. I found the buttons to be fine and easy to use. I don't know the complaints on this. This speaker will be easy to transport and the sound will not disappoint. I think I am going to buy another one to get more sound out of it. Well worth the purchase.",5,1,2017-2-18,1,0,0
I bought this speaker for my bathroom but it's mobility makes it so easy to move around where I might be.  It's easy to charge.

"I love this Oontz Angle 3 speaker! It has great sound, volume, and connectivity to my phone, iPad, and computer.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the lack of controls on the unit.  It only has play/pause and volume up or down.  Other than that, this is the best sounding bluetooth speaker I've ever owned and would definitely buy another if something happened to this one.  I've owned it for about 6 months and use it everyday, so far have had no problems at all.  Seems like a very good build quality which is nice for a change, considering all the crap out there these days.",4,1,2018-7-16,1,0,0
"I rarely review products but I was listening to this little powerhouse today and thought I should take the time to give it 5 stars. I already thought I had gotten a helluva a deal, but turns out I paid HALF what I thought I had paid.It paired easily, no problems using it in the shower, it is super lightweight and transportable, battery lasts well (and auto-shutoff keeps me from wasting battery when I leave), and the sound quality is excellent (even outdoors). I plan to buy more at this price for myself and for gifts.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
I'm almost always involved in one Broadway musical or another.  I saw this at a rehearsal for Young Frankenstein last year and immediately bought one.

"I bought two of these because of the great price and I use them at least once a day.  I hook them to my iPad when watching Netflix for better sound and to my iPhone for great sounding music.  They connect without issue and have amazing sound.  Took them to work to show one of the guys I work with because he does mixing and sound production as a side business.

"Wow, I can honestly say that even 2 months of owning this little guy, that we're still impressed by the full range of sound that comes from this. We've never run it all the way dead, so it's a little hard to determine total battery life (which I realize is relative to the volume and type of music). The only hiccup I've ever had is that the bluetooth pairing on the phone seems to be laggy...meaning I sometimes have to switch the speaker on then off or turn the bluetooth on my phone off then on to get it to sync.",5,1,2017-2-10,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker for my fiancé as she likes to listen to music while getting ready or in the shower. I have to say I was thoroughly impressed by how loud the speakers were. There was even some bass to it. Connecting to the device was very easy, power on, hold Bluetooth button and then you are connected. I've had similar priced speakers before and they easily just broke down after a weeks worth of use. This is a great speaker for the price, I've only charged it once and it has lasted since Christmas on a single charge.",5,1,2017-1-5,1,0,0
"UPDATE: I'm literally applauded at the moment. The company sent me a replacement speaker stating it was probably damaged in transit and that's why it quit working. Well guess what!? The EXACT same thing has just happened to the one they sent me to replace the other P.I.S.! Unbelievable... seriously DO NOT waste your money!This speaker worked great, for about 2 weeks until now! It just STOPPED turning on. The power button just stopped turning on and I have no idea what happened? I was literally just using it on my laptop and it simply quit working while it was IN USE. What kind of BS is this!?",1,1,2017-9-7,1,1,0
This is a vast improvement.  I like to listen to music while showering and this works perfectly.  It puts out plenty of volume and bass.  Easy to connect to my laptop in the other room.

"Got this to replace a Bluetooth speaker in my bathroom that i had for years, which finally bit the dust.  This speaker sounds at least as good, and paired with my Bluetooth phone quickly and consistently. Bear in mind this is a very small speaker, so don't expect it to be a house filling party speaker, but it gets pretty loud for its size.",5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"This little speaker is amazing. I bought this for my mother-in-law as an alternative to a giant boombox. The idea was to pair this speaker with an old Android phone, essentially using the phone as a media player. It took less than a minute to set up the speaker (which basically means taking it out of the box) and pair it with the phone. The sound is awesome, clear, crisp and sufficiently loud, especially for the price. (Please note that I'm not a pump-the-bass kind of guy, so I won't comment I'm going to buy another one for myself.",5,1,2017-9-19,1,0,0
I bought this to use while I am working on a renovation project. I chose this particular model because it says Bluetooth worked up to 100 feet. Mine didn’t. It worked only if I left my phone on the table next the speaker. So I returned it.I assume this was a problem only for the one that I bought. The sound quality was good for a tiny speaker and the batteries lasted all day.,2,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0

"Was actually really impressed with this speaker.  My boyfriend had purchased a bose Bluetooth speaker for 120 and this speaker surpasses it in quality and features.  I've owned this speaker for months now and I've only charged it once.  I thought I would only use it in the shower but I now use it all over my house indoors and outdoors.  It's nice to be able to listen to music while doing yard work.  It's easy to use and nice to be able to adjust the volume while in the shower as well.  It's easy to carry and links up easily to any phone.  I definitely HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone looking for a Bluetooth speaker.  The water resistant is such a bonus especially in the summer months or anyone with children!  The music is crystal clear, it has bass.  I'm really surprised the 2 speakers have that much output!  Don't bother looking at others.  Just see that it has over 6k reviews and click buy now!",5,1,2016-6-29,1,0,0
"Obviously its size limits it's output but based on the size, the fidelity is good. There is enough low end to hear kick drum, and the mid range is smooth. Bluetooth range is great, feels durable, and the best part is its inexpensive.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,1
"I bought this speaker in sept 2017, for the price it has more than lived up to my expectations. I was leery about purchasing this thinking it wouldn’t last but I use this almost daily  and have had zero issues. Other reviews say the sound quality isn’t good or that it’s not loud enough but I disagree, maybe it doesn’t hold up to the $100+ portable speakers but honestly for ~$25 this thing is great, gets pretty loud and the charge lasts awhile. Definitely recommend and would buy again.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

My main reason for the purchase was to listen to podcasts and music streaming from my phone while at my work desk and that's where it gets used about 80% of the time. When I leave for the day, I also take the speaker with me. I have an older pickup truck that doesn't have bluetooth or an auxiliary jack. Before getting this speaker, I would position my phone speaker in one of the cup holders to create sort of a poor man's echo chamber which helped a little, but honestly, that sucked.",5,1,2018-11-12,1,0,0
Loved these speakers until they just stopped working randomly.  Only noise that comes out of these speakers is a low crackle.  Very unhappy as they broke within a few months of purchasing these.

Everytime I try to use this one I have to turn off my laptop bluetooth and turn it on again. as much as I want to say I love this speaker.

However it sounds like there is very little bass in this speaker and it just doesn't provide a good sound quality.  If it's noticeable to me then it's definitely worth taking into consideration.

Better than expected. Loud for its price. Clear. And best of all it can be use as a hands free device on my bmw 335 in which the radio its not working anymore.

It doesn't need to be charged very often, it has a super long battery life. The triangular shape (which I thought was weird at first) is surprisingly ergonomic for carrying and it's great for making sure the speaker doesn't bounce around when played at high volumes.

"It's loud and clear pairs easily with my phone, so far the range is pretty good as well.As with most speakers this size it will start to distort when played at max volume although it also depends on what your listening to as well, Death metal you most likely will not notice the distortion, Bach you will notice the distortion.",5,1,2016-5-24,1,0,0
This speaker sounds great. The problem was the connection where the charging cable cable goes into the side of speaker.the input has pushed back into the speaker and makes it hard to get a connection to charge. I've have only had it for 7months. I don't abuse and it stays in same place most of time. Frustrating.,3,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0

"I shopped around for about 3 months for a wireless portable speaker, based on the reviews that I saw I chose to purchase the Oontz Angle 3 next gen. speaker. This is one powerful little speaker. I love the look and the design of the speaker I also love the waterproof feature. The sound quality was excellent considering the money that I paid. The speaker is just the right loudness and the bass is also outstanding. This is definitely a great purchase.",5,1,2016-11-30,1,1,0
"This worked for about 6 weeks then the blue tooth stopped working (had our neighbor who works in IT check it up and down -- multiple phones, laptops, etc.).  Then the 1/8"" jack stopped working.

"This this is loud for its size and I got it for $19.99 on Amazon! It is slightly smaller than the Angle (1st Gen). It is louder (I own the 1st Gen and Angle 2 also). Even though it has two strips at the base of the unit (I assume to absorb any vibrations), at full volume (from a Macbook Air), the unit basically acts like it is on a trampoline. This is why I give it a 4/5. However it still sounds great and just at a little lower volume, the bouncing around stops.  However it still sounds good and I would recommend. Great for gifts or as I use them, in your office or around the home for when you need a little more sound.",4,1,2015-11-17,1,0,0
I'm no sound system expert - this speaker was on sale so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I LOVE it.  It produces great sound quality (don't ask me specifics about base/treble whatnot - I'm not a music junkie enough to know/care about that stuff) and clarity and it has a really cool shape.  Its great to play music when I'm cleaning or working on my computer.  I love that it is water and shock resistant so I'm not worried about it getting wet if I want to listen to music in the bathroom.  It's a great little speaker!,5,1,2017-1-12,1,0,0
"Extremely surprised in this speakers overall performance. For 24.99 (sale) it can't be beat. At regular price i wouldn't even consider investing. I have previously owned (ended up selling each) Sony: xb30, xb20 JBL: CLIP 3, Flip 3 and charge 3 Tronsmart: T6. Comparing to the two larger companies in Sony / JBL the angle 3 would fall short primarily for the light bass and potential distortion at loud volumes. However, for overall loudness, size weight and battery life this speaker can't be beat. I use it as a bike speaker and it reminded me of having the flip 3 with a bit less bass.",5,1,2017-10-12,1,0,0

I bought this because of the possitive reviews because I had bought a boss mini and thinking maybe I over paid for the same sound. Well I was wrong while this one is really clear sound but the bass is none existing. The boss has rich sound and awesome bass it sounds like a home speaker bass.

"I have had this for about a year, and it finally died on me. The speaker does everything really poorly except for the actual sound quality (which is the most important part, hence the 3 stars). The controls are not that intuitive. There is no indication regarding the battery life. The speaker just all of a sudden stops working when the battery goes low, and the lights on the device stay on making it hard to determine if the battery is dead or if it is just not connecting properly. Then there is an unknown amount of time after plugging it into the charger before it starts working again and no indication when it is finished charging.The sound quality is good. It's battery life is decent and the range is adequate. It's a bit of a pain connecting to bluetooth if you use it on multiple devices. It lasted a year and now it isn't being recognized by any of our phones or laptops anymore. I would have liked for it to last a little longer.",3,1,2018-2-12,1,0,0
I use this to listen to music from my phone while riding in a horse arena. It's loud enough to hear at the other end (70') and easy to find a small spot to set it on.

I wish it had a longer cord to connect to the Dot.  If you plug it in to use it that way,  Echo dot has a hard time hearing any commands since the speaker has to be only inches away from the Dot because of the short cord. Most of the time,  I have the speaker in the room I'm in and not connected to the Dot.  Playing time is about 5 hours on mid range volume.",4,1,2016-10-29,1,0,0
"I love this speaker so far. I am beyond impressed with the sound quality for it being on the smaller side. It’s very lightweight and portable. I know that when I take it somewhere it will fit perfectly in my purse or other small handbag. It easily connects to my phone and holds a charge for a long time. It also charges fast. I can’t say enough good things about this speaker, buy it!",5,1,2018-5-28,1,0,0
"Remarkably good sound quality considering how tiny this unit is.  It was easy to set up.  The only improvement I may suggest would be to include a SD card slot and possibly making the unit completely submersible on the next version.  All in all, it is a terrific device with a bargain price.",4,1,2018-4-7,1,1,0
"I love everything about it except the way it sounds. looks and feels like a premium product. But the sound on this thing is aggressively upper and mid forward. I have owned and loved alot ""budget"" Bluetooth speakers and been very impressed with a number of them and know what to realistically expect out of a small speaker. but this one, even more than most is not well balanced. hard consonants and snares, vocals will drown out all instrumentals when near the speaker. Best listened to with speakers facing away or lightly baffled by something.",2,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
I’m obsessed with this little guy! It’s in my kitchen and I’ve been using it daily to play music while I’m cooking or doing dishes. And the sound is good enough that I can crank it up to cover the whole house for a dinner party or chores day. It’s also sturdy and portable with a great battery life so I’ve popped it in my bag for the beach a few times as well.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"This is the portable bluetooth speaker I've been looking for - and buying lesser speakers in the process of finally finding it.  Most important:  The sound is extraordinarily clear and crisp - not just for a speaker in this price range; the bass is strong; and without distortion at volume - just clear music.  I'm writing this in one room and listening to the speaker in another.  The compact size and light weight make it easy for me to tuck in the corner of my carry-on; and when playing it loud isn't a good idea, the reception range, from room to room, is quite good.  And, Jennifer from Cambridge Soundworks customer service is terrific!",5,1,2016-4-14,1,0,0
Aside of the fact that I wish it could be a bit louder but still has great sound. it’s a great product especially for the price. We use it a couple of times a week by the pool and the battery last well. I’m pretty satisfied with the purchase.,4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
It is a very good product in terms of sound quality and durability but the charge on the battery is not that good it doesn't last that long so you have to keep it on the charger because the battery will only last approximately 90 minutes... The the power supply is very tricky on mine it became a little loose so therefore it did not always take a charge...,3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"My old Oontz Angle went missing, so it was time to replace.  I love that the Angle3 RainDance speakers can be paired for stereo separation, so I bought two.  Each speaker sounds really good.  Combined they sound great.I have not gotten them wet, so I can't comment on water resistance.  As a listener, I am very happy.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"This thing is great. Had one for about a year now. Still strong. Use it in the bathroom while taking  shower. (I leave it outside the shower, not in direct contact with the runnning water) buttons work fine. Protective flap for charging port is still perfectly in tact. Connect to devices very easily. I hardly ever turn the volume all the way up because that would just be too loud for personal listening. Not enough boom to entertain a house party, but that ain’t its purpose. It has taken a few spills off the table because of it turned up high the bass makes the speaker slowly travel across a smooth surface. The few falls it has taken haven’t hindered it one bit. I would recommend.",5,1,2018-11-11,1,0,0
"I am satisfied with the speaker. It plays differently from phone to phone and with my older Nexus 7o 2013 tablet. It seems to get the best sound from my LG G3 phone with the included sound cable but works fine on the bluetooth connection. I also have a LG K10 and it does play from that phone, I think the sound is not quite as crisp as it is from the G3. I use these from my laptop as well as my budget laptop has awful built-in speakers and this speaker really is an upgrade for the laptop sound.",4,1,2017-3-30,1,0,0
"I was impressed with the sound quality from this small portable speaker. It beat my old Jam Classic that I had for years before it stopped working. The Oontz came well-packaged, and I immediately tested it on high and low volumes. Bass-heavy jazz is a good genre to test a speaker with. On high volume, it worked wonders. On low volume, a static-y noise indicated that the speaker is blown out. Not sure if it was caused by me playing the jazz on high volume, or if it came that way.Refunded and will purchase a second one because I'd like to give it a second chance.",4,1,2018-3-26,1,0,0
The Solo is smaller but has a better sound. Low bass volume on the Angle 3 plus the woofer is on the bottom while the Solo puts out more bass because the woofer and tweeter combination is on the front panel. Buy the Solo. It is cheaper and better. On the Angle 3 the woofer and tweeter are two separate speakers. Due to the woofer being on the bottom of the unit it is hard to hear bass from your music.,3,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0

Great product but even better customer service.  After owning the product only a short time it stopped charging.  I reached out to Sound Works and without hesitation a replacement device was on the way. Before this incident the battery would last 2-3 days in use for about 4-6 hours a day non stop. For customer service alone I would recommend any product sold by Cambridge Sound Works.,5,1,2018-3-15,1,1,0
Wow!  I can’t believe how loud this little speaker can get!  I used it for the first time in a music room to play mp3s off my laptop so that we could folk dance.

"I am a real customer who purchased this product. I don't usually do reviews, but I must say I was so impressed with this little Bluetooth speaker, I felt I should give a shout out to oontz angle. I turned it on expecting it to sound like a cheap $20 speaker. But wow was I wrong. It sounds better than my JBL charge I paid over $100 for. It's incredibly loud with no distortion. And the bass, for the size it is, is also incredible. I absolutely recommend this product to anybody who is looking for a great Bluetooth speaker at a great price. Thank you.",5,1,2018-4-10,1,0,0

So I bought this just after Christmas to use at work.  I don't use it every day nor do I use it for more than 30 to 45 minutes at a time at a medium volume.  Here it is almost a month and a half later and I still have yet to have to charge the speaker. My only complaint is if I want to switch playing things from my phone or ipod I have to turn the bluetooth off on the device I want to play songs from.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.,5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
Perfect for jamming out while I'm in the shower I'm usually singing It's The Final Countdown by Journey dancing all over the place being a goofball this thing really gets me going in the morning !!

"It’s smaller and lighter than I expected it to be, yet wayyyy more powerful. The sound coming through is very clear and I can hear all the instrumentals and bass and whatnot.Pairing and switching between my tablet and phone was easy.

"It's $20, true, and it sounds good for the price, but  6 months in and the charger port is too loose to hold the cable. A temp fix is to use a thin blade to bend the metal input back into shape. Solution for the manufacturer- use better/stronger materials for the input and you'll see a lot of complaints go away :)",3,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0
"very pleased with the appearance, weight & size.  The sound quality is very good for such a small speaker.  I do have to disagree with the battery life, unless I""m not using it correctly.  Even at low to medium music volume, maybe 5 -7 hours tops.  Yes, I did do a full charge upon receipt and each time the battery has died.  I do leave the unit powered on, whether using it or not and if that's the reason for the poor battery life then I guess I would have to shut it off and turn it on continuously...",3,1,2017-1-31,1,0,0
"This is by far the absolute best small, wireless speaker.  I bought it to play downloaded music for water aerobics classes that I teach. My expectations were quality sound at a level the class could hear clearly.  Since I already owned a Cambridge Classic radio that I love, I decided to give this little guy a try.  I couldn't be happier.  The sound at top level is clear, and the balance between base and regular is amazing.  My class has no trouble hearing the music.  It is loud!  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for portable speakers that are compatible with their wireless device.",5,1,2016-6-4,1,0,0

This is perfect for any room in the house and you will be surprised at the quality of the sound.  The rubber around the speaker protects from damage and it seems very durable.  We have had for 2 months with heavy usage and it's working great.",5,1,2016-12-9,1,0,0
"Product sounds great.  Paired with phone easily when speaker turned on.  Too bad it didn't come with the case and clip.  Also, the auxiliary cable needs to be longer.  Another two feet would be perfect.  Speaker is great for the size.  Better sound than most at this price and size.Should come with the case and clip.  It's small so portable.  Make it functional.

"after about 3 years of light use, Oontz will no longer accept charge.  Probably something to do with a bad micro USB connection on the unit.

Currently I have it connected via Bluetooth through my Nexus 6 phone.  I plan on connecting it to my laptop and also a DVD player in the near future.  I'm hoping that it can be connected to those two devices simultaneously but have not had the opportunity to try yet.  I also was able to be a room away from the speaker about 15 feet away and with a wall in between with no interference.

He takes his OontZ Angle speaker with him to practice, games, parties etc. Friends of his have the Beats Pill and other more expensive speakers and they always ask him to use his because the volume and quality of sound is much better. This has been banged around in his backpack, at the pool, in the locker room at the practice field etc and keeps on playing with no problems. Pairs very easily with his phone (Android) and his tablet (Windows 10). When it finally does die (shows no signs of it yet) we will get another OontZ Angle to replace it.",5,1,2016-9-22,1,0,0

I mistaken both times and nearly gave up until I stumbled upon this phenomenal device. I purchased this speaker late June and have yet to run out the battery at work or home.The sound quality is by far the best I have heard. It can get a little distorted at the highest volume but with as loud as it gets you won't need it at thehighest level. I recommended this speaker to all of my friends and family.

It does have a reasonable amount of low end though, and it's pretty clear. Mids and highs are pretty good too, it's not a high end speaker by any means, but again, impressive for the price.The only slight problem I've found is that it's so lightweight, it tends to vibrate whatever surface it's sitting on, which creates a buzz (from the surface, not the speaker) and if it's too loud it can vibrate itself right off the table. I know some other speakers like this come with mats to prevent this, but just setting it on something soft (like a dish towel) works.",5,1,2016-11-2,1,1,0

"Great price for the quality!  I purchased this to have audio for public speaking presentations.  Out of the box it paired easily with my MacBook Pro and the quality was very clear for a little speaker.

Thank you!",5,1,2018-4-27,1,0,0
"I bought this item for my mother for Christmas because she wanted a bluetooth speaker. I was initially worried when the product arrived because I expected the speaker to be bigger, however dont let the size fool you, this thing can put out some noise. I was actually quite impressed with how high the volume went (my mother wanted this for when she does work out in the yard). My mom loves this speaker and uses it quite regularly. The bluetooth set up was really simple. I would definitely recommend this product to others.",5,1,2017-2-18,1,0,0
I've had this for just over a month and it's stopped charging suddenly.  I tried the power cord that come with it and I even bought another separate cord.  neither will charge my speaker.  After a quick google search this seems to be a very common problem.,1,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Because it's Bluetooth don't have to use ""another"" plug into my computer.  Space-saving but good sound.

"There's a reason why this little speaker has a million positive reviews. You will not find a better sounding speaker for the same price. I recommend experimenting with placement of this speaker throughout your space until you find the ""sweet spot."" You will find that it likes being within a foot of a wall or corner. Also, the passive radiator on the underside of this speaker does a great job of ""infusing"" your table, countertop, etc. with low frequency sound, so placing it on a hollow surface can give you better bass response.",5,1,2017-3-6,1,0,0
I got this because a friend of mine has one that is similar but it must be one step up. The base on mine is not as good as the one on his. Also it makes a crackling sound when you first connect sometimes last for about 30 seconds to a minute But after that it is fine. Battery life is really good will last all day long at work or longer.,3,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"For $25 this does the job!  Provides richer audio from Galaxy S7 Edge and a Blue Tooth enabled computer.  Audiophiles might want to nitpick, but this is really perfectly adequate to boost sound in a small RV or on the couch!

"It does what it says on the tin.  The volume is a bit lower than others, but the sound quality is usually a bit better.  So that's a decent trade off.The only problem is when using an Aux cord the sound quality for some reason takes a really bad hit.  It sounds terrible.  But having it bluetooth connected to my phone 2 feet away it works fine.",3,1,2018-11-8,1,1,0
"Had this about 3 months now. It mostly stays in my shower, and regularly gets sprayed with water. I do take it out in the back yard when I grill and have family over.

Surprising volume and quality for the size of the speaker. I got this for my music loving daughter who would walk around carrying her iPhone on speaker to listen to her music- definitely a step up from that. She was thrilled.We tried using it to watch a movie on the computer and at times the sound seemed lost in the room (not quite enough umph) but it also could have been the sound quality of the movie. I'd say for full room sound a larger system would be necessary but for her small room it work perfectly.,5,1,2016-1-11,1,0,0
"I purchased this after seeing the one my friend has. I loved the sound and clarity of it so I decided to buy one myself. I didnt know I was buying a different smaller version, but I was happily surprised since it wasnt as bulky, but still provided the same clarity and volume. I love how durable it is and that I get to use it wireless, also the battery life is pretty long. I wish I could use another one at the same time as to set up a true surround sound system while on bluetooth, but for the price and how it works, i love it.",5,1,2016-10-26,1,0,0

Can I just say Lord Jesus this speaker is amazing.  It's loud and really plays good.  I listen to a lot of songs with bass and what not and a few times this speaker has moved from the center of the table all the way to the ground because it vibrates and jumps a bit from my music.

We have been very happy with this product and are needing another one for our daughter when she comes. We like to use the white noise app on an old outdated phone, or youtube off of wifi for our kids.

"Xmas gift for kid, would not work at all after charging....did not power on, not able to pair via bluetooth.  Instructions indicated there were both a power and bluetooth LED indicator light, but neither would light (Note:  the part of the speaker where the instructions said the lights would be were appeared to be solid rubber coverings, so not sure this would have worked anyway).  Quite disappointing.1/4/16 UPDATE:  I returned the non functioning unit to Amazon for a full refund, rather than an exchange.  Was fully intending to purchase a different brand speaker.  Was promptly contacted by the manufacturer via email who then offered to make it right by sending a replacement at no cost - along with an apology for the inconvenience (tough when a kids gift doesn't work).  New unit arrived in 2 business days and works great.  Sound is excellent.  Would DEFINITELY buy again given both the quality of the sound for the price but also for the way this company went above and beyond to earn back my business.  They recognized the value of earning that good word of mouth and the return business that loyalty earns above their cost to replace.",5,1,2015-12-26,1,0,0

Small with big sound that we can hear over the roar of the jets on the tub, excellent.  The hot tub is covered, but rain could blow in from the sides, so I went with this one for the protection, but at the price, you could place these all over the house.  I recommend if you're looking for something small, but with big sound.",5,1,2016-7-3,1,1,0

Bought 4 of these to pair with my Amazon Dots to give better sound quality than single channel speaker.  Sound quality is very good for small footprint and does not take up lots of space.  Surprisingly the sound quality was better using Bluetooth versus the hard line-in that came in.  Using the hard wire you get a crackle of interference from being so near the Dot.  Once I switched to Bluetooth no feedback.  I now get really good sound quality for my Dot - not quite the Echo quality but great for multiple installation around the house,4,1,2016-12-28,1,0,0
"I've had this speaker a little over a month. It is loud & durable, it dropped from about 5 ft because I didn't realize the bass was strong enough to make it shake off the shelf. I've spilled a little soda on the front and it didn't hurt it at all. Oh and the battery life is awesome, i've used it for 10hrs not even completely charged with no problem. I really have no complaints. It's a great speaker at a great price.** Came back to add - a year and a half later, my husband left the Oontz outside in the rain and cold all night. When he found it this morning water poured out of it. I thought for sure it was shot. Nope! Sounds and beats as hard as the day I got it. If this thing ever breaks, i'll buy it again.",5,1,2016-6-24,1,9,1
"Awwwwww man this little speaker is sweet.  We have had outdoor speakers waiting for me to install them for going on 6 years.  Nope just couldn't find the time or want to do it.  So bought this to set on the back porch for relaxing while the kids play.  It's GREAT.  Sound is very clear and loud.  Got waterproof because I have a 1 year old that loves to dunk everything in the water table.  Price was cheap.  Quality is solid.  Bluetooth connects is seconds.  No need for longer batter, just charge it when needed.  Who really listens to music for 10+ hours anyway?",5,1,2016-5-27,1,0,0
"This speaker is ok. Sound is not superb, but considering what it costs, I think it's fine.  It is sooo much cheaper (quality-wise) than the OontZ I replaced, which had a better sound.  It pairs very easily though and I like the shape of it.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"Holds a charge, great volume and tone, light weight and very well priced. Very easy to work with, and the charges hold about 20 hours of use.  I'm reviewing this speaker because I had to search through my past orders to purchase 2 more of the speakers as holiday gifts. I've had a number of Bluetooth speakers over the years and this is by far the best.  I have no complaints or criticism. 100% recommend.",5,1,2018-9-16,1,0,0
"This speaker is so loud, easy to use, and produces crystal clear sound. It took me all of 10 seconds to figure out how to pair it to my phone and it came with almost a full charge so we used it right away.

"OontZ Angle 3  for 27.00 is about all you need for a portable iphone speaker.  It actually sounds very good for its size.  I got this one over the longer battery life plus model because this one was said to have better sound.  Glad I got it.With pandora or amazon prime music it turns your iphone + OontZ Angle 3 into a mini radio, jukebox.  I have two full sized stereos that sound great but for in the car, in the kitchen in the garage this is good enough and very easy to use.",5,1,2017-2-15,1,0,0
"Is it great? Will you throw away your KRK-5 studio monitors for this thing? No. It's not that sort of device. However, it's pretty inexpensive, very small  (surprisingly so), and sounds ""okay.""

"I needed an inexpensive speaker that was loud, had clear sound quality and was simple in features and easy to use. This speaker is all of those things in what seems to be an indestructible package. I’ve already splashed it with water and dropped it between having it at the pool with me this summer and sitting on the tub ledge beside me at home, and in every case it has continued working fine without skipping a beat. I’m really pleased with it. The minimalist triangular shape and design is pretty cool too, and I love that it’s portable enough to throw wherever before you head out somewhere. I have no complaints. 100% recommend.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"Very easy to use with good sound quality. I purchased this speaker set after my previous bluetooth set from another manufacturer died out. Pairing was quick and easy, and separation distance from the sound source is as good as my previous speaker set. I've already dropped this from about chest height onto a wood floor. The speaker exhibited no problems after. Volume is good for listening within a room and can be heard fairly well from an adjoining room. I mostly use this for audiobook listening, and the sound response is great for that purpose.",5,1,2016-7-9,1,0,0
For such a small speaker it really kicks out some sound! I had purchased a speaker twice the size of this one from Costco and I returned it because it barely got loud. I had a hard time listening to it in my bathroom during a shower. And it was $40. I saw all the reviews for this speaker at half the price of the one I bought from Costco so I grabbed two. I am very happy and listen to music in my bathroom with the shower going and it kicks out great high quality sound! Def a great product!,5,1,2017-8-29,1,0,0
I bought this speaker in August 2018. Ths sound was just okay. The battery lasted four months and we are carefull about plugging it in. Would not recommend this speaker. It's barely hanging on now.,1,1,2019-1-6,1,2,0
I ordered the CocaCola version of this speaker and I am very pleased. I listened to music for about 5-6 hours on high volume for three days before it died. It charges fast and you can take it anywhere. I even put it on the dash of my car that doesn’t have Bluetooth. Also used it outside a few times. I looked around for a Bluetooth speaker for a while and I got a great one on the first try.,5,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"Awesome speaker, great sound, great battery life. If you have it cranked up to max volume the battery does go a bit faster but I’m not complaining. It’s a great speaker. I just bought the case for it to help protect it from travel from work to home and etc. I would definitely buy again and upgrade when the time comes.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"I have had this speaker for over a year now and I have to say it is well worth the $. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is there is ZERO bass. It sounds kind of ""canned"" but the music is clear enough and gets LOUD if you want it to. I bought this for a float down (on a raft) on a lake and it ended up raining and hailing for awhile and this little speaker held up fine. I still use it at work and the battery lasts for a good while.",4,1,2017-8-10,1,1,0
This is an awesome speaker I have had it for over a year now and it stills performs great.  It also has very good battery life.  This is a great brand with an outstanding product.  I would definitely purchase it again.,5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
For the price and size this speaker definitely exceeded my expectations. I have had small speakers before and they always end up sounding tiney and barely better than the speaker on my phone. NOT the case with this! The sound was strong and loud and best of all was the bass. It was super easy to pair with my phone and I like the fact that I can also plug it in. The only thing I would change would be to include a wall charger instead of just a usb cord to charge it.,5,1,2016-6-11,1,1,0
"It's OK. I use it with my phone and my music keeps pausing. I have to keep pressing play every 5mins, which is very annoying. The bass is low too which I don't really like. I listen to music with quite a bit of bass so not so good. I would return it if I was able to get a full refund.",3,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
"Had this nearly a year now, and its been brilliant. Compact and good quality, sturdy and easy to use. Doesn't make annoying beeps when battery is low, just a small red flash, and it turns itself off if it totally runs down. Would have been nice to have an indicator of battery capacity, but can't complain",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
The sound is surprisingly good. It connects via Bluetooth instantly and holds a charge for days. Rugged construction makes it great for using outdoors while gardening or at the poolside. Very satisfied and recommend this highly.,5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"I usually don't write reviews, but I had too with this speaker! We had this beautiful little device for whole year, it survived a summer by the pool, the heavy Kansas rain, baby drool, being dropped I don't know how many times, with never effecting the sound quality what's so ever! A few days ago while I was outside taking care of my goats, my youngest decided her and her beloved speaker need to take a swim in the small duck pool. Sadly to say it won't survive a swim in the pool with the ducks and small child! I will buy again!",5,1,2018-6-5,1,0,0
"A very good item for the price. I really like the sound and the battery life is good, but there is no way to tell the amount of battery life left when using my laptop, though I'm informed other devices will do so.",4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"Works well.  For the price, I cant complain.  I have heard the UE and Bose and they do sound better but cost more than double.  The big boys do not sound twice as good though.  So for less than $40, the Oontz is a good buy for the price concious music lover.  Pretty good for a kitchen or living room.  If you plan on having a party or U are looking to impress;  then spend more on the big names. Bose (base) and UE (midrange) do sound pretty good.  If you are a casual listener that wants more than a plug in speaker from walmart, then this fits the bill.  Easy to connect, siomple on off and volume control, rubberized end caps, doesnt slide or slip on counter.",4,1,2016-1-24,1,0,0
"I am a musician and sound quality is always important to me. The reviews for this speaker are very positive, but I am not that impressed with sound quality. Battery life is ok. We keep ours plugged into a TV with the USB cable to keep charged. Small size is nice and great for taking on the go or working in the garage. Just wish it had bigger better drivers for better sound. May upgrade to a 25W unit to get a bit more punch and bass.Overall, it's a decent little speaker with clean sound.",3,1,2017-1-10,1,0,0

"I got this about six months ago and have been very happy with it. The sound is good and the Bluetooth connection works very well. I have also used it with a cable, which worked fine too. I almost wish I had gotten the bigger one, but really this one is sufficient for my needs.  I enjoy listening to podcasts with it. Great speaker.",5,1,2018-10-22,1,0,0

"This speaker is exactly as described! Good sound, easy to use, compact, and connects easily with my Samsung phone.I don't have a bluetooth system in my car, and like to listen to audiobooks downloaded on my phone, as well as music, when I drive--this works really well--sound is loud enough (easily adjustable) to listen even on the freeway, and is also convenient for hands-free phone calls.",5,1,2018-2-4,1,0,0
We purchased this in July of 2018 and it worked great until about a month ago. It absolutely will not connect. On the rare occasions it will connect we basically have to stand on one foot and do the hula while dancing in a circle to finally make a connection to either of our phones. In short- don’t plan on this be a long lasting device.,2,1,2018-11-14,1,0,0
I AM AMAZED. Holy wow! Sound quality is INCREDIBLE. I've had other Bluetooth speakers of similar and larger size and this puts ALL of them to shame,5,1,2018-11-20,1,2,1
I had my doubts when’s i first got this. It’s much smaller than I’d imagined. Still I tried it out and I’m glad I did. It’s as loud as any bluetooth speaker I’ve had. The battery life is insane.. I connect it to my tV which I have on all the time but the battery doesn’t go out for 2 days. It’s really great. I’m glad I got it.,5,1,2018-11-10,1,0,0
"I am a musician and stereo enthusiast, and I was very pleased with the sound quality of this little speaker. While it's not something you'd use to make a party get going, it's perfect for playing music at a desk or in your backyard while sitting at a table with a cool drink. It does get pretty loud, with surprisingly good bass for its size and price. One other reviewer put it perfectly: for a fraction of the price of the Bose Color Soundlink, you get very good sound AND splash resistance. Even if you did ruin or break this speaker, you could go through several of these and still spend less than the Bose. The speakerphone feature is also a nice plus. Bluetooth linking with my iPhone was seamless, too.",5,1,2015-11-20,1,0,0
"I am using this for more than 6 months now. I bought another for my husband too. He also found it very good.  In one word, this Bluetooth speaker is awesome! Audio quality, Bluetooth signal range both are good. It is worthy of the price.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
I have put this little speaker to the test. I house sit and always take this with me. I use it on my nightstand for music at bedtime and at my computer for Bluetooth audio from my computer. I have taken it with me to visit friends so we have music while hanging out. I'm very happy with this speaker and for the price point can't be beat. I keep it in a travel cover during transit.,5,1,2018-8-21,1,0,1
Great little speaker for listening to music from my iPhone or iPad. Gets just loud enough to be loud and to not distort the sound of the music. I use it all of the time. Much louder than my echo dot.,5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"This purchase makes the third OontZ Angle 3 I purchased over the holiday. I received an iHome for a gift, but was very dissatisfied after hearing the other two speakers I purchased for my children. The bass is tremendous on these units. The clarity is crisp! Highs and lows are great and for the price, what a great little speaker. I usually tote my speaker around the house as I work or cook. I do love music, so I cannot abide any device that distorts the sound. Unfortunately, the iHome did just that. So...I ordered myself the same speaker I bought for the kids for Christmas. I love it! A powerful little Bluetooth marvel. Not lots of features, but who cares. I know that I can use it as a speakerphone if I'd like but that frankly gets on my nerves! I just want to listen to music - whether classical, Brooklyn Tabernacle, hipster, 70s tunes, Bruno Mars or Beeji Adair - I want the music to sound great, and if I'd like, to pump up the volume without distortion. This little powerhouse does not disappoint! Great Bluetooth option.",5,1,2016-1-3,1,0,0
I thought this was much bigger than the pic. The sound only goes in one side of the triangle... I thought was on both sides. The sound is good and battery life is good too. I was just disappointed on the size.,4,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"For the price, this thing really can't be beat!  Puts out good deep sound for a small room.  Also nice to have when out in the backyard or at work.

"Despite it's cost and other reviews, I wasn't happy with this purchase and returned it.It sounds ""Okay"", but not great, especially compared to Amazon's own AmazonBasics Portable Bluetooth Speaker.

My husband wanted a speaker to use while working in the garage so I decided on this one but I was worried about how the sound quality would be with this after reading some reviews. We were pleasantly surprised at how well this works! The quality is great and the battery lasts for a long time. It was charged about two weeks ago and is still going strong with daily use. I'll definitely be buying more of these! I use it almost daily in the house as well as for when we're sitting by the pool. My kids have thrown buckets of water on it and it still works.,5,1,2016-8-10,1,1,0
"I’ve had this for just over 4 months, now it will play a couple of songs then lose bluetooth connectivity. Pretty sad. Past the return window so I suppose it goes into the electronic recycle bin. Junk.",1,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"Great sound quality for the price and size. The bass and sound clarity were surprisingly good and trust me I have an eclectic taste of music. Its so simple to use. Only 5 buttons on the whole speaker. You either pair it via Bluetooth or a 3.5MM audio cable. The battery life on the speaker says 7 hours and that's assuming you use the speaker at 60% I've had this speaker for a couple of days now and I've thrown everything at it. I've brought it in the shower with me, played it really high volumes, and I've had it in the kitchen and it's still standing. So overall I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for something light, durable, and isn't going to break the bank.UPDATE- This speaker is flat out amazing. I've put it through hell and it's done a great job for me. The sound quality is what has impressed me the most. I've dropped it, had it covered in sand, snow, water and as long as you clean it relatively quickly it's fine! Definitely worth the money folks.",4,1,2016-12-2,1,0,0
"worked fine for a couple of months. It was used only inside home, and only for 1 hour or so per day at the max. It takes a long time and multiple attempts to connect with any devices now, and even after connecting the sound breaks every second.. poor product..",1,1,2016-12-26,1,2,0
"This speaker met every expectation I had of it from the reviews I read, and surpassed them with continued use at work. My previous speaker was a Roverbeats T3, an amazing speaker in it's own right, considering it's size and low price. This new speaker takes the top spot, however. Everybody comments on how nice of a speaker it is, and cannot believe how little it cost me. The bass is very noticeable, not the best you can get in this small of a package, but for the money, it is amazing. I noticed with the volume cranked up on certain tracks, it actually makes the speaker vibrate, to the point it moves on certain surfaces. Luckily I had a potato I could place right next to it, to keep it in place. The battery lasts about as long as you would expect, going on almost full volume, I find I have to plug it in as least once a work day, if I'm listening to music the whole time, but it works while plugged in, so it's mostly not an issue. I'm not sure if it's my phone, but I've never had a speaker do this, when the signal gets a bit weak, instead of cutting out immediately, it will slow the tempo down. Very strange, but I guess it keeps the music going in that sense. I can't wait to try the larger variants of this, they seem like they would be even better quality wise.",5,1,2017-2-5,1,6,0
"I'm glad I purchased it before my overseas trip. I stayed at an apartments-type hotel and when this baby played, I could hear the music well from any point in my apartment. It's loud enough and it doesn't distort the sound.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0

He says that it the perfect bus speaker it loud enough hire over the sound of the engine and wind and he is able to put up in between the dash and windshield and because of its shape it wont move it fits perfectly.",5,1,2016-6-7,1,0,0
"Speaker reviews are so subjective, and I had a hard time deciding which portable speaker to buy.  I didn't want a speaker the size of a tennis ball because really, there's just no way that's going to have any decent sound or volume.  It's for my teenaged daughters to use and for taking out to the pool.  This is a great sounding speaker, given its size.  The girls can hear it without turning it all the way up, which is nice.  It has bass (good enough).  For the money, this gets five stars.  So keep that in mind.  I'm very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2016-7-26,1,0,0
"Really surprisingly good sound quality from this little speaker. The bass is way better than I've heard on other portable bluetooth speakers. It isn't just good for a bluetooth speaker, it's good in general. It also gets REALLY loud and I've never actually needed to put it on full volume, usually quite a few notches below it.It has a really solid feel to it as well and doesn't make me worry that it's gonna crack or break from normal use or minor impacts.

My 11 year old son wanted to buy a Bluetooth speaker with money he received for his birthday.  I personally own the Dknight MagicBox II which is a great speaker.  So I pointed him in that direction.  After looking at about 10 speakers that were in his price range he decided on the OontZ Angle 3 not only for the look but because it had good reviews.  So after receiving the speaker I have to say it's AWESOME! Louder and clearer than my MagicBox II.

For how small this speaker is the sound comes out great! Very happy with this experience and would recommend this item and any other items from this company!,5,1,2018-11-6,1,0,0
Good for occasional use. But frequent use will wear out every aspect of this speaker. At first this speaker appeared high quality but after about a year of occasional use is worn down and lost certain capabilities. First 1 of the 2 speaker shorted out and halved the volume. Now the charger port will not allow the speaker to charge at all.I'm overly protective of anything I own. This was never dropped. Used only by myself and never got wet. It was literally used in a perfect scenario and still deteriorated in the course of a year.,2,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
I read a lot of reviews and did research before buying it because I’ve had bad luck in finding a sturdy and portable speaker to use for my classroom.I’ve had this speaker for a few months now and it has been one of my favorite purchases for my classroom! It is SO loud and the sound quality is great! It was sitting on my desk one day when a student knocked over my coffee and it still works perfectly! We take it outside to recess and it has been dropped on the sidewalk multiple times and it STILL works perfectly! If this speaker can hold up under 25 fifth graders then it can work for you! :),5,1,2018-1-4,1,0,0
"It doesn’t have deep bass but it’s pretty loud. It lasted 3 days playing music during the day on one charge. It also connects super fast to my phone. I gave it three stars overall because it advertised deep bass, but it wasn’t that deep.",3,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"So I bought the original Oontz angle about 3-4 years ago... It still works (very well) to this day... But it's very ""tinney"" and full of high range with no boost to the mids or lows; that being said it was still a very rugged and trusty BT speaker... I just got my angle V3 and let me tell you, it's just as loud if not louder, but now it has body, some low mids, even some lows... It needs more weight to pull off the bass it's trying to put out, but if you set a book on top of it, it booms lol.Very happy with this product and its predecessor ... 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Cambridge thanks !!",5,1,2016-7-27,1,0,0
"This little speaker is lightweight but packs a punch! I've taken it to family parties, hiking, gym, and listen to it regularly in my home. I live in a one story home, so it's loud enough to be heard all over my house. The low end is descent, when you're up close to the device. It has a nice, full sound. The only time you can hear a very slight distortion in the high end is at the highest volume setting.Synced to my Samsung S5 and my wife's iPhone 6 flawlessly. Other family members have used it with Windows phones without any issues either. Charging takes a while, but I usually charge it at night along with my cell phone.",5,1,2016-3-16,1,0,0
I purchase this portable speaker to use outside and to also pair with my echo dot. It took a while but I got it to pair with it.

"The battery does not hold a charge and therefore, the sound goes out!  I made a request to return it and the response was that it was in a new package and therefore, no return.  I responded that it does not work and I have had no additional response from Retro or Amazon. This fell well below my usual standard for things ordered from Amazon.  Additionally, what does the packaging have to do with the product working properly?  Take it Back!!!!!  Buyers do not use them!!!!",1,1,2019-5-23,1,1,0
The sound quality is great!  The volume is great!  I use it in the car since to listen to music through my phone. It works great.  The only issue is from out of the box I have to have the power in at a slight angle and just right to get it to charge. I think I will return it and get a new one.  I’m going to wait for the weekend and see how much it bothers me and if it comes undone on it’s own while driving.,3,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
I have to be honest this little thing is a trooper. It survived a river tube trip where my dry bag turned out to be not so dry. It wouldn’t work for a day after that but then magically came back to life . 10/10,5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
For the price not bad. But no dynamic in sound jus needs to get a bit louder and then you got something but for a small very quiet place and price go for it.,3,1,2019-7-9,1,1,0
It was way smaller than expected. It looks like the the other speaker size for sale on Amazon. I did the picture in room and that look must be a lie... cause this is so small. But the sound is clear and loud. I will give it that. Not sure about battery life yet. Good luck,2,1,2020-5-10,1,1,1
"I have used this as my drive to work/drive home radio for a week, then used it outside doing yard-work over the weekend with the volume cranked the whole time. The battery lasted for all that as well as another drive to work. Never has a connection problem with it and my phone. I just bought another because my wife started borrowing this one over the weekend.- Great price, great battery, great connection. No complaints! Time will tell as to durability.",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"This little speaker has a great bass output for such a small size. Great battery life and is very loud. However, I wish I bought the next size up because that one has the skip forward/backward buttons on the speaker itself. This one does not.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
This is the best speaker I've bought. On par with my JBL flip 2 speaker for half the price of that one. Definitely recommend and the battery is pretty solid. In my brief time with it I only charge it once maybe twice a week. And the added bonus of it being able to take some water splashes makes this the perfect outdoor speaker to take anywhere. Honest review and I was not given this speaker for review. just thought I'd do one for this product.,5,1,2017-4-13,1,2,0
Because it was a cheap speaker I didn't expect much and boy was I surprised it's really a great speaker very very loud way louder than I expected runs a long time after a full charge I want to get everybody I know one for Christmas.,5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
Update: After writing this review Oontz reached out and offered to replace my speaker. The new speakerI works perfectly and I haven't had the same issues with the previous speaker. Great customer service!!!!have had this item only 2 months and it is no longer connecting to my phone. Instead it will play things in other languages at random times(4am) when I dont even have it on. It was great those first couple of months now I cant use it,5,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0
"Hands down best Bluetooth Speaker. Looks and feels slick and high quality. sound is unreal. Very loud with great bass and high treble. Quite surprised.  Glad I bought it.  If you don’t like this speaker l, then it’s you, not the speaker. You probably don’t like the sunshine either. Buy it if you need a loud quality, water resistant travel size speaker.

"Very nice sound in a compact package. I am mainly using the auxiliary input jack and using this speaker with a 24"" computer monitor in our kitchen with streaming video. This speaker sound so much better tan the built-in monitor speakers there is no comparison. The volume controls are convenient, and the play/pause button mutes the sound when using the aux jack.",5,1,2018-6-5,1,0,0
"I've had this speaker for 8 or 9 months now.  I've had a handful (at least) of similarly sized, inexpensive bluetooth speakers over the last few years.  This one is the best by far.  This thing is sturdy, genuinely water resistent, sounds great, and works great as a speaker phone for phone calls.  I really can't say enough good things about this speaker. It is easily worth three times the price.",5,1,2018-2-21,1,0,0

"First, it is exactly as advertised! It gives a good sound that fills an average room and is really easy to pair. It's tiny, the size of a small beer glass and has rubber endings for staying in place and for the inevitable bump in your bagBUT...the best thing is the customer service. I purchased one and it would not hold a charge after charging the required time. The company got right back to me, within a day, and offered to replace it without my incurring shipping costs. They also followed up after the new one was received offering technical assistance if needed. More good things about this speaker? It holds a charge(defective one excluded) and takes about 5 hours to charge fully. You can also connect your device by wire. Surprisingly good sound from my IPhone 6.",5,1,2016-5-31,1,0,0
"I bought this so I could tether it to my phone because I listen to podcasts while I am driving and my car isn't equipped with bluetooth or an audio jack. This speaker is incredible. Better quality sound than the standard speakers on my laptops, desktops or phones. Louder sound output and even at it's highest volume it produces rich crisp sound. This speaker produces smooth audio with realistic tones.I'm so impressed, I'm buying more. It is rechargeable with micro usb plug. Intuitive design making it very easy to use.",5,1,2017-1-29,1,0,0
"Nothing bad to say about this little speaker. It has surprisingly great sound for its size. Great battery life, light weight and water resistant. Couldn't ask for more. Though due to its size, it will not provide you the same quality and sound as something like the UE Boom 2 (which I also own). If you are looking for something for a louder and deeper base, then this is probably not for you. If you are looking for something that is small, compact and light weight then look no further. Great quality for the price.",5,1,2016-11-30,1,0,0
"Hate it!  I only need it to work for 4 hours max, 4 days a week. It won’t work 30 minutes a day each of those 4 days. Not only does it not hold a charge but even if it did, it won’t keep the Bluetooth connection so songs are always in and out. So frustrating!",1,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"I’ve had this product for over a year now, and am still very happy with this purchase. I use this speaker almost everyday, and the battery life is still great.

I’d highly recommend and will absolutely be a repeat customer.",5,1,2018-6-9,1,0,0

"USB-powered speakers can't deliver much volume.  It takes power for the speaker diaphragm to move air, and USB just doesn't provide that.  This speaker is rechargeable battery powered and delivers decent volumes.  Good sound as you'd expect from Cambridge Soundworks, although with speakers this compact you can't expect much stereo separation.  You can drive it with bluetooth or a 3.5mm audio cable. It recharges via a USB cable.I've tried two different USB powered speakers with my laptops and this is way better.",5,1,2016-8-27,1,0,0
"Nice speaker for the $.  I've purchased several inexpensive speakers and haven't had much luck with them lasting or providing an acceptable sound quality or volume. This one is different.  I purchased this for a beach trip and it worked great.

It also fell in the sand a few times and kept on going without issue.  Good buy.",5,1,2017-11-17,1,0,0

"Wow, what an excellent product! This would make an excellent birthday, or other special day gift. I never considered buying a Bluetooth speaker before recently, but I am currently working in a kitchen in the wilderness for a season and the sound on my phone isn’t loud enough for easy listening. This little speaker packs a huge punch and I am extremely satisfied. It is small, sleek, and has excellent sound. It came well packaged, with directions, and with a charge cord to plug in to your computer, or the base of a phone charger. It is extremely easy to use- you simply turn on the power button located on the back of the speaker, and then turn on the Bluetooth button on the side, and then select “oontz angle 3” on your phone Bluetooth or computer Bluetooth settings.  The power button turns red when you hold it, and blinks red when it needs charging. The Bluetooth button blinks blue when finding the connection, and remains steady blue once connected. It is surprisingly loud for such a small item, and I can now listen to audiobooks or Spotify all day without straining my ears over kitchen noise. You do not need wifi to keep the connection from the speaker to your phone. So, if you are in a situation like me, where the internet is sparse, you can download your playlist on Spotify or elsewhere, and listen outside or wherever you like without internet. Now, let me tell you about the customer service. I had a small snag with my item, (not a manufacturer defect) and I contacted the seller through Amazon wondering if I would ever hear back from them. They got back to me extremely promptly, and provided excellent customer service and resolved my issue. I am now a loyal customer to Cambridge Soundworks, and I hope you will be too. I did NOT receive any compensation for writing this review, nor did the company ask me to do so- it’s just a great product, and an excellent seller. I hope this helps.",5,1,2017-7-17,1,4,0
"This speaker is awesome. It has enough volume to get the job done. We often use it to play sleep sounds at night when going to bed. Nothing like a nice sounding rain shower for a good night's sleep. It also works very well with my iPhone8. I've gone into completely different rooms with no loss of connectivity or signal quality. I've gone as far as about 40-50ft away. So if your car happens to not have bluetooth, this is a much less expensive alternative to installing one or buying a new car.It seems to take a while to charge because the red light never went off after several hours of charging. I may have missed something in the instructions. The charge does last for quite some time though. For $20 on sale, there are really no cons to mention about this. My wife actually ordered a second one for backup since I use it so frequently.",5,1,2018-8-4,1,0,0
"I bought 2 of these as gifts, the price was great and the style was nice. I also bought the case which was a good design. I was very disappointed to learn that the sound quality was not at all what I expected. For having a high star rating I expected a much better sound.  All this talk about bass made me think it would be a decent, solid sound. If it doesn't sound good, why listen to it?  Perhaps this would work for something other than music; sports broadcast, etc. If I would have tested them before giving as gifts I would have returned them.",2,1,2018-2-14,1,0,0

The volume is a big problem. I got it for my mom as a gift and when we hooked the bluetooth up to her phone it was not very loud. I put the speaker volume up as loud as I could and then had to turn the phone volume as high as I could do get the benefits of a speaker. The alert on her phone popped up saying that having the volume that high would damage the phone. She might as well just use her phone without the speaker then.

I am very pleased with the sound and quality of the speaker. My neighbor and cousin both have one and they suggested I order one. Really happy with the sound quality and I highly recommend buying one!,5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
UPDATE:Just outside the 90 day limited warranty and the passive bass radiator has failed. The sound (which was previously very good for the price) is now unbalanced but functional. Can't recommend purchasing this due to the failure. YMMV.,2,1,2019-8-8,1,0,1
I've only owned the OontZ Angle 3 for a few weeks but I'm pleased with its performance. The sound quality and loudness that it can be played is a definite upgrade from the previous Bluetooth speaker I owned and which bit the dust due to the internal charging connector breaking off.I also like that the OontZ turns off automatically after 5 minutes of non-use. If I forgot to turn off my previous 'cheapy' speaker it would just drain the battery down to nothing. I can't vouch for its waterproof ability.,5,1,2016-9-23,1,0,0
This has to be the best speaker ever made. I compared this with my brothers Beats Pill and it blew it out of the water. This one sounds so much better. I always compare this to any other speaker I come across and this one wins every time!,5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"Instead of connecting directly to the speaker with Bluetooth, I wanted to connect my phone via bluetooth to an Arcam miniBLINK which would connect to the speaker via 3.5mm. Unfortunately, there was interference and the speaker made a constant high-pitch sound. Not the most common use-case for this speaker, but I'm disappointed that it didn't work.",2,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0
This is the second oontz Bluetooth player we have bought. The first was run over by our tractor. Great sound and Bluetooth connection. We live in a pretty small home so you can hear it throughout. Worth the reasonable price.,5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
"The sound quality of this small little speaker is absolutely INSANE!! It gets SO LOUD & stays clear.  You know how on some speakers when you put the volume up loud it sounds muffled or staticyhe? That’s not the case with this speaker. The size is perfect. The price is great, can’t beat it. I’ll be buying a couple more as gifts. Too good not to share.",5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,1

"While this speaker does have a good sound quality, every my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note9) would get more than 10 feet away from the speaker, the Bluetooth would disconnect. I would then have to shut off the Bluetooth on my phone and turn it back on to reconnect. Very problematic. Furthermore, after only 2 months of use, the battery in the speaker is not only completely dead, but it refuses to hold a charge and barely plays when plugged in. Cheap product, cheap materials, won't be buying this again or recommending it to anyone.",2,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"Bought this as a gift for my mom, and we could not even be happier! The sound quality is a little on the bassy side, but that's what I expect from a bluetooth speaker. The overall volume is what surprised me the most. Wow does it get loud. It filled my moms den and the kitchen (About 400 square feet) with christmas music no problem. Also, the shockproof/waterproof rubber coating was well appreciated, since my mom has a tendency to drop and spill stuff on her electronics.",5,1,2017-1-2,1,1,0

"I purchased this to use while I build things in my workshop, and the fact that it fully enclosed means that no sawdust etc. gets in the device, which is really nice.  The sounds is amazing for such a small speaker, and was a huge upgrade from my existing Bluetooth speaker (iSound Twist).  I was primary buying a new speaker because I needed better range than my current BT speaker would allow for, and man did I get it.  This speaker has EXCELLENT range, It borders on having too good of range.  I use this speak in my workshop (garage) and this will auto connect to my laptop, and play flawlessly across my entire house through 4+ walls.  For a price tag of < $30 I really couldn't be happier.  I will say that this doesn't have ""Next"" and ""Previous"" controls which I don't mind at all personally, but I was a bit surprised that they were' missing.",5,1,2016-8-26,1,0,0

"NOT because of the speaker itself! I got in a hurry and jammed the charging cord in and broke off one of the pins. Totally my fault. The first one hung out in my blacksmith shop (cutting, grinding, welding, coal dust, etc) blaring away and never missed a beat. It's loud without distortion and, surprisingly durable. I, honestly, had little confidence it would last very long in the environment it was going to be in. I love these speakers. My neighbors? Probably not as much as I do.",5,1,2018-8-24,1,0,0
"I swear I read 100's of reviews on various Bluetooth Speakers and there were a lot of great choices. What sold me on the user reviews for this product was the couple that accidentally ran over their speaker with a truck and trailer. And this thing still played.

"I did not realize until after i received that you had to control volume from the device as well as your phone. This is unusual as compared to similar devices and I find it inconvenient.

Will be returning.",3,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"I bought this Bluetooth speaker because I need a reliable bluetooth speaker for my car. Where I live there are lots of roads that need repair. I have a small car with stiff suspension that transmits shocks through to the stereo very efficiently and the stereos tend to break pretty frequently. With all the road noise, I need a speaker that has a lot of power, has bluetooth and a long-lasting battery. This speaker meets all those requirements. In addition, it has better sound quality than the previous bluetooth speaker that I'd bought for this purpose.",5,1,2016-5-18,1,0,0
"I had to restart an Amazon device once or twice to get it to pair with the speaker. Other than this inconvenience, the speaker has paired with four devices. I haven't tried it beyond twenty-or-so feet, and I have had it for almost two months, using it moderately.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
This little speaker is loud enough to use in large rooms for birthday parties and other indoor gatherings. It's even loud enough to have some music in the back yard while gardening or hanging out.

"My sister brought her expensive Bose speaker to my house and I liked it.  I thought it was a bit much to spend over $100 on a Bluetooth speaker and started looking at options.  This was the highest rated and reasonably priced option.  I am not at all disappointed in this purchase.  It's loud!  I can hear this throughout my house and am very satisfied with its size, portability, and loudness.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality speaker that won't break the bank.  It would make a great Christmas present.",5,1,2016-10-26,1,0,0

It is blissfully easy to get it to sync to my devices, has better sound than everything in my house with the noted exception of my entertainment system.  Three kittens have tried chewing on this gem, and it still works perfectly.  I would recommend this to everyone that wants a great sounding, portable solution to crappy electronic speakers (cell phones, tablets, and such)  they don't even really sell up the fact that it also functions as a hands free microphone/speaker combo.  This is truly an awesome product.",5,1,2015-11-28,1,0,0

"Have had this for about 2 weeks now and really liking it.  I have been using the Jam Bluetooth Speakers for the last 4 years but the Oontz is far superior -- nice sound range, great size (fits in your car cupholder!), lots of volume for such a tiny thing, and great bluetooth connectivity.  I use with both my iPhone 6s in the car and iPad air in the house.  It can only be paired to one device at a time so I have to manually switch it from one device to the other but the connection happens very fast -- seconds.  The Jam Speakers had horrible bluetooth connection and I always had to use a 3.5mm audio cord.  Oontz is a good buy.",5,1,2017-2-7,1,0,0

Great bluetooth speaker for the low end. I use it in the shower for music and podcasts. Audio is not the best but is pretty darned good for the $20 I paid for the item.

"I’ve had this for a few months and I really like it. It’s definitely loud enough. I wouldn’t suggest this to someone who is looking for stereo quality sound or deep bass, but it is a good compact speaker. Nothing ever sounds warped and it gets plenty loud. Doesn’t take up too much space either. I’m quite pleased with it.

"Read all the great reviews on this before ordering it. It was a birthday present for my boyfriend. He loves it. It gets really loud and has pretty good quality sound for something so small. He loves it cuz he can take it into the bathroom and listen to music while showering, and we will be able to take it camping this summer. Battery life is great.The ONLY problem we have had with it is the bluetooth range. He set it in the living room and walked into the kitchen with his phone, and the music began to skip. Maybe it's because we have a closed off kitchen and bluetooth can't travel through walls, I'm not sure. I give it 5 stars anyway though. I'm sure it will be fine without walls outside :)",5,1,2016-3-14,1,0,0
"The sound is really good and once you get it to work is awesome. BUT, I have had a hard time connecting the speaker to my iPhone 11 PRO.

Other times the speaker connects , but my iPhone still doesn’t see it as a “source” so no music is played out. I have a Samsung Note 8 and is the same problem.",3,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0

I love this speaker! It is exactly what I wanted! It gets very loud it can fill a room with Music. The shape is cool and it's splash proof not submersible in water. I take it in the shower with me and it works just fine. Definitely worth the buy. I play it for a couple days on a full charge 5 bars less than full volume in burst of 1.5-2 hours.

Seller is great but the product is very average in my experience. It sounds a bit tinny and I can't go forward or backward with songs.

Every once in a while you come across a product that actually surprises you. This is one of them. This speaker is small. It's loud- really loud. When you use it indoors in a normal sized room it is loud enough to be painful. Bass is strong and there is nearly no distortion at top volume.The other part that impressed me is that the sound quality is just as good when the volume is really low. I like to use it for quiet background music and the sound clarity at super low is awesome. Overall fantastic product.,5,1,2017-9-27,1,0,0

It gives decent amplification for a small room but the sound isn't rich or full.  I do realize this is a portable speaker but I have another set of portable Bluetooth speakers that work really well -So why did I buy this one if I was already happy with what I had?  The reviews seemed good on it and it was a Lightning Deal for $20 or so.

"Yes, this is a Bluetooth speaker, and yes, it does pair up and play music from your device, but to claim that the sound quality is anywhere near ""good"" is stretching things. There are some Bluetooth​ speakers that make you wonder just how someone managed to make so much sound come out of such a small device. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those. It sounds ""okay,"" but there is nothing about it that is going to amaze you in ANY way. Yes, it plays music, but don't expect it to amaze you in any way. It plays music like any small speaker would, but nothing more...or less, to be fair.",2,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0

"I haven't used many bluetooth speakers. Additionally, I haven't used most of the functionality this one offers. I've connected this (via bluetooth) to my Amazon Echo Dot and tucked this speaker out of reach behind some objects on a shelf (about fifteen feet from the Dot). It is consistently plugged in and I do not make use of its portability. I do not use the buttons nor have I used the 3.5mm audio cable connection.For a Bluetooth speaker, though, this is great. Music is enjoyable, though obviously not as good as a proper stereo system (apples and oranges, there).

"Awesome sound out of this small and lightweight speaker.  Bass is good for such a small unit also.  Well made and pairs with device quickly.  Will pair with last device it has paired with if multiple are available, so have to switch to preferred device if not the last one.  Pads on bottom are large and soft, but not level, so it has tendency to move when played at high volumes with lots of bass.  None of the shortcomings outweigh the sound, quality and value of this inexpensive Bluetooth speaker.

"edit:  the Cambridge Soundworks customer service representative who saw my 2-star review offered me a replacement less than 24 hours and shipped it priority and it got to me quite promptly.  between leaving a lousy review and getting a replacement, only 4 days went by, with most of the delay coming from my not sending them my address sooner.  they also gave me a carrying case to go with it.  I found this service to be exceptional, and the replacement speaker works as well as the original, and given that I would have given this speaker 5 stars and the fact that they threw in a freebie for my trouble, I have modified my review to 5 stars.  this is a great speaker, made by a great company.Worked great for just less than 4 months. Then it just mysteriously died while sitting in my backpack. When I put it in, it worked great; when I took it out, pressing the power button felt like a mockery as nothing at all happened. Would be 1 star, but I really liked it for the 4 months it worked. Great sound.",5,1,2016-10-18,1,0,0

I suppose if u work in a Dunder-Mifflin cubicle and can't bother anyone within 6 ft. this is for you. If u go outside or want something for use in a vehicle..SKIP this one.

"Considering its compact size, this thing yields fairly impressive dynamics and range. However, I like to blast my music, and cranking the Oontz Angle up all the way regularly sends it tumbling to the floor. It also depletes the battery quicker than the 3 hours it takes (!) to charge. In addition, as other reviewers have mentioned, the USB charging port is incredibly shoddy. After only 6 months of use, I have to jiggle and gingerly reposition the cable just to keep the cord in place so it will charge. For about 10 bucks more than this product costs, I recommend upgrading to a heftier speaker with a more durable design. I am currently doing just that.",2,1,2018-11-25,1,0,0

Or course you aren't going to hear it over a miter saw but you can easily put this in the middle of the house and hear it in several connecting rooms. I've not had it exposed to moisture at this point but it's been covered in dust and its sealed up real tight, I'm planning on taking it to the beach next week and I'll have no concerns about taking it out in the sand.",5,1,2016-7-19,1,0,0
"This thing is extremely proficient as a portable speaker. I was worried it wouldn't be because it's pretty cheap and such but it's made of rubber and metal, the Bluetooth connection is super strong, I can be in the kitchen or living room with the speaker in my room and I'll stay strong as heck. It's been on for 3 hours as of right now at pretty high volume, haven't charged it at all and it's hanging strong. I suggest this speaker for any purpose. It's very clear and smooth. Usb rechargable (comes with cord) and can be connected directly via aux (included).",5,1,2018-9-4,1,0,0
"This is a great thing to have! I use it almost every day at work, I keep my phone in my pocket and the speaker makes sounds - that's what I wanted! The audio is a bit tinny, but it could be the songs/files themselves. It holds charges for a couple days, being used for a few hours with high volume each day. It does it's job, and I have recommended it to a couple of other people due to it's portability.",4,1,2017-12-20,1,0,0

WOW! I am a Bose enthusiast who can no longer afford their prices. I was forced to by this product as a result (with great trepidation). My expectations were very low until I got the Angle 3. I hooked it up immediately because there was charging on the battery. WOW! What a surprise. The unit far surpassed my expectations. Great sound at any volume level and volume personified.  Pockets short?  Don't hesitate. Get more than your monies worth by purchasing the Angle 3 for your mobile music needs.,5,1,2017-1-12,1,0,0
"My last portable bluetooth speaker ""crapped out"" when I couldn't rescue it fast enough in a surprise downpour, so I was looking for a replacement, thinking ""I'll be more careful with this one"", when I saw this one listed, with similar specs, a slightly higher price, but water-resistant, I decided it was a better deal. I was surprised at it's compact size, and BLOWN AWAY by its incredible sound! I have to actually turn it down when listening in the house. Controls are intuitive and unobtrusive:  the on-off switch is nicely indicated with a tiny sticker, which probably saves a lot of phone calls. Bluetooth pairing is immediate & seamless. Recommend for anyone, anywhere - indoors & out.",5,1,2016-8-21,1,0,0

I opened it, charged it, and hit play from my Spotify. HOLY #*()@*()@&$()*# this speaker is so loud and pushes some serious bass!! I literally was blown away at how small this is and how loud and crisp the sound is. This is one of the best little speakers I have ever heard play music. I don't know how anyone could have a bad thing to say about this speaker. It's seriously the best sound for the size and super loud with nice bass!You will NOT be disappointed! I can promise you that.",5,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0
I've had this speaker for over a year now and it only works fine.  The only problem I have is that every now and than the sounds starts cutting in & out requiring a power off/off to fix the issue.  I don't recommend it - especially if you're using the speaker during a workout.,2,1,2018-9-5,1,1,0
"I use this outside while working.  Very loud, even when 20 ft away.  Nice sound and worth the price.  This is the second one I bought.  First Angle lasted me 4 years.  Easy to connect and use.

Six laptops and two phones- pairing with this thing  is a nightmare.  Our units  units  pair with other devices  with no problem.  This guy doesn't want to talk.  Once in awhile we get it hooked in and it works fine- sounds good.  But it takes a lot of dickin around.,2,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
Yes this worked great for about six months and then it would still pair but it would not provide any sound. I tried it on several things and same on all. So I used an auxiliary cable and that's worked fine for six months.  Until 3 days ago and now it won't go above volume 1 or 2.  Very bummed as it used to put out great sound for a while,1,1,2017-12-28,1,2,0
"This speaker meets my needs exactly.I purchased this speaker to serve two purposes. First, it is my primary speaker in my small office and is connected to my Echo Dot. The sound fills my office perfectly and is much richer than the built in speaker of the Dot. Secondly, I wanted a portable, rugged, inexpensive speaker that could be taken to the pool or beach. The price point is perfect and it is surprising that the so much sound can come from such a small device. Now, that said, this is not a high end speaker that will replace your home stereo - but if you are looking for a portable stereo that produces great sound (for its size) than I would recommend this speaker to you.",5,1,2017-7-31,1,0,0

Amazing product! Purchased for my father and it’s fantastic! The sound is amazing and it’s super portable and durable. My dad works outside quite a bit and doesn’t always like to have his phone in his work area for fear of it getting damaged. He had his phone charging inside and was outside splitting wood and was able to listen to music; the battery life is just as advertised. The fact that it’s rechargeable and still able to play while it’s plugged in is amazing. For the price it’s a steal! I absolutely recommend this.,5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
I've had mine for about 6 months now I use mine at work and when I go boarding and it bumps and pretty much lasts all day! I've dropped it in the sink at work and it's fallen out of my bag while going down a hill the only thing that happened was the front panel popped out but I fixed it with super glue and it still works like new! Love this speaker when it finally dies I'll probably get another one for the price I've gotten half a year out of it and it's better than my friends stupid beats pill thing!,5,1,2017-6-10,1,1,1
"This little speaker is just slightly larger than an iPhone 6. Took me by surprise to see how little it was. It is very discreet and will be great to have ambient music throughout the house without being tied to a specific location. Quickly recognized by my Galaxy S6 and played music very clearly. I only wish the volume was a bit easier to control through my phone. Comes with a very short charging cable, barely long enough for it to be plugged into the wall and rest on the floor, but a typical phone charger should work as well.",5,1,2016-5-16,1,0,0

I was kinda nervous when first got it because I thought it was bigger. I was completely shocked at how loud this thing is for its size.

Otherwise impressed with the product... only reason I didn't leave 5 stars is the size.",4,1,2018-3-13,1,0,0

"For it's class this is a good speaker it can get pretty loud (about 75 dB according to my test), and it has decent bass for a speaker it's size. However I preferred the sound of the DKnight Magicbox II. The Magicbox II sounded a bit richer and more dynamic. The big thing this has that the Magicbox II doesn't is the Water Resistance. Otherwise I prefer the Magicbox II not to say this isn't a great speaker, I just put it as 2nd best of it's class.

I've had products from Cambridge Soundworks before...back in the 80's I had purchased one of their Sub-Woofers to go with my Polk Audio Monitor 10B's....but this is incredibly light weight, produces stellar sound and gives my old Bose Sound-dock some serious competition for sound quality.

I was saying to myself how could such a small speaker deliver full sound as many of the reviews I read touted.  My fears were cast aside once I easily paired with my phone and cranked up the volume  The Angle 3 delivers a rich full tone for such a compact design.  I'm sure it is due in large part to the passive radiator design.  I have to say I am thoroughly please with my purchase and look forward to long hours of listening enjoyment on the golf course, beach, and at home.",5,1,2017-4-17,1,0,0

From the reviews the Oontz Angle 3 fit every criteria - splash resistant, Bluetooth, long battery time (yet to be reported on by offspring), quality sound (to my old concert/aircraft carrier abused ears), the added feature of speakerphone (which a somewhat more expensive name brand did not have), small size which lends to high portability, available accessories, and best of all - the price point. I added the neoprene carrying case, an extra charging cable, and an extra aux cable because while my child is very responsible with her devices, cables suffer a short life span.Needless to say Daughter tested this thoroughly right outta the box.  Range, volume, quality of sound, ease of connecting to Android Bluetooth device(s) all passed the teenager checks. It came with a charge on it as well.",5,1,2016-1-4,1,0,0

"This project was delivered March 28. Today, one month later and AFTER the return date, the wireless function has failed. Yes, the sound is good but now only when plugged in. Now, the wireless feature works for a few minutes then turns off even with the source inches away. Revised 5/2...received and email from the company offering to replace the speaker! I'm pleased and impressed with such efficient and prompt customer service! Revised 5/15...Received replacement within a week on contact. New speaker works flawlessly with a clear, full sound.

"I've been using this speaker for about 4 days now and I love it. the sound quality is actually pretty good, and I was surprised at how loud it can get considering the size of the speaker itself.

It's loud enough to where I can hear it downstairs and the battery has a pretty long life too.the only thing I'll mention is if you listen to it really loud, keep an eye on where you set it because the base makes it move Around and it could fall.

"Love this speaker. It's easy to connect to any device, the connections are great quality (haven't experienced any stuttering or loss of connection), the built in Mic is an awesome feature because you can make/take phone calls without disconnecting from the device, the sound is amazing (really good high, mid, and low balance), and the device itself feels really robust. The only thing I don't like so much is that the speaker tends to vibrate at high volumes, which doesn't affect the sound, but it has fallen I few surfaces. Thankfully the edges are covered in thick rubber, so it hasn't taken any damage from falling.",5,1,2016-1-5,1,0,0

Awesome speaker. Small and compact. Has great sound. Simple setup too. Takes about 30 seconds. I use it all the time when I’m riding my scooter. Bought one for my friend for graduation too.

The Anker, I’ve had for a while.. and one lasts. I don’t know if this one lasts, but the sound is clearer to me.. and it comes with a case.. plus it’s waterproof. A good buy! Better than a speaker that I had that was 100$!",5,1,2017-10-29,1,0,0
"First off, at full volume, this thing is loud and the bass is impressive for it's size.  With that said, at full volume, the battery won't last too long, but it will last long enough for you to get tired of the volume setting and turn it down to a level where the battery will last for a couple of hours.  I'm very happy with mine.",5,1,2018-11-28,1,0,0

I do wish the controls had some color on them as it is hard to see the Pause and Bluetooth on button as it is black on black.

Bruised the hell out of my ribs and arm, but the OontZ was completely unfazed.",5,1,2018-4-18,1,0,0

It's a decent speaker, but it's certainly nothing special. I bought it because the reviews were really positive about the quality of sound, but I've used this speaker for 6 months now and I'm pretty disappointed with it.

This little speaker packs a punch. The sound quality is amazing and it's $20 bucks! We like to listen to music while the kids swim and run around the yard and this thing is LOUD and the sound is pretty crisp with multiple generas of music from Brad Paisley to Korn and everything in between. Definitely purchasing a second one for my husband to take to work,5,1,2018-6-12,1,1,0
I'm returning this because there is no forward or backward buttons so you can't advance to next song or go back to last song.  And the power button isn't easy to turn on and off.  It's small flush against the unit in the back on a corner.  Also it's the same red light that indicates power on and battery charging so once ..too confusing.  Sound is nice though.,3,1,2018-5-31,1,0,0

What surprises me most about this speaker is how evenly it distributes sound. Also gets decently loud and battery life is great. Bass is average/not that great but within expectations on a speaker this size. Shuts off after a few minutes if you don't play something - ought to be longer. Also wish they would have gone the extra mile on the bluetooth implementation and supported multipoint so you and a friend don't have to disconnect/reconnect every time the other person wants to play a song.,3,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
"This little speaker is a powerhouse for the price! It is louder when its played horizontally, but you can play vertically for the buttons to be on top.Buttons are a little smaller and hard to see (same color as the background) at night.

NOT tin sounding at all and strong bass, which for me is essential.  Super simple instructions on blue tooth pairing -- about a minute.

The better quality recordings sound even better... and you can crank this volume up pretty well.

Make sure you charge this little sucker up before you throw a party. We were really excited to open up our little speaker but after 35 minutes of using it we had to plug it up and charge. I believe that it wasn't fully charged after we opened it up from the box. After charging it for 3 hours this speaker projects clear and crisp music. Its been a fantastic purchase.

Battery lasts a long time (can watch TV on iPad at top volume for a couple days before needing to recharge speaker). Haven't tried it in/near water and don't plan to. Only complaint is for some reason when I pair it with my iPhone 5s to listen to audiobooks it drops the first syllable of words after any pause in the narrator's voice.

Amazon sent me the missing cables, so that was a nice surprise. What's more surprising is the speakers sound quality after 50-100 hours of use. The sound quality has become far better. Warm, rich, with great vocal detail.

But from handling it and just doing my own personal assessment of build quality,  attention to detail,  and materials used to construct it I'd say it looks pretty durable. A couple of mid level drops shouldn't cause you and panic.",5,1,2016-9-27,1,0,0
"Bought in June, RIP in September. Will no longer pair with any devices. 2 stars because it was awesome when it worked **UPDATE** I reached out to the company for technical support and they were of the opinion that the speaker must've been damaged in shipping to experience such a failure so soon. They replaced my speaker with a brand new one immediately, covering all costs. Updated to 5 stars because that's how you do business - provide a quality product, then stand behind it. I'll always buy Cambridge Sound Works products when I have an audio need.",5,1,2016-9-25,1,0,0
"For the price you can not beat this little speaker. Well made easy to use long life small and portable,I have had this speaker about 4 months and use it constantly . I am 44 years old musician that listens to music all day. I have owned many cheap and really expensive portable Bluetooth speakers. Very happy with this",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"Found out the tv I bought this for didn't have Bluetooth so I had to buy a 25-foot cable to run around the room to place this next to the bed. Works fantastic considering the $100 plus ones I almost bought, like from the cable company. Why not 5 stars? The rubberized top. You have to squeeze in the buttons and the rubber picks up dust the very first minute on display that can only be removed with a damp cloth. It tends to look and feel like an old chew toy found under the couch. Great sound and great price though.",4,1,2016-5-19,1,0,0
Not a fan of this speaker. We needed a speaker that could connect to phones or laptops and this does not do the job. We are not impressed with this product. It is better to spend $60 more on a speaker that will actually work and not be a waste of your time or money. It does not connect to Bluetooth on any device.,1,1,2019-7-10,1,1,0
Great speaker. Sound is really clear and volume is louder than I thought it would be. It said it has a 10ft range but it has worked while my tablet was at one end of the house and the speaker at the other. Has a lot more than 10ft range. I am really happy with this speaker and for the price was great too compared to others I looked at.,5,1,2018-9-24,1,0,0

"Speaker was used outside during ball games to play music in our dugout. Everyone loves it.  HOWEVER, it recently started not turning on. Thought ""maybe it is just completely dead?"" even though it was fully charged the day before. Found a blurb online that you can reset it using a paper clip in the aux jack. Did that, voila, back in action. The following week, it did the same thing. However, the magic paperclip did not bring it back to life. It is dead. I'm extremely disappointed that it only lasted for a little over a year, with the only use being during summer time. 3 stars for quality sound and construction, minus 2 stars for life span. Won't buy an a oontz again. Currently looking at competitors to replace it.",3,1,2018-7-21,1,0,0

love it!! easy to connect and sounds great. the shape makes it easy to 'point' the sound in a certain direction. only complaint i have is how loose the charging port is. i have to maneuver the cord in it just right and then not touch the speaker again so that it can stay charging. kind of a pain but otherwise its a decent speaker.,4,1,2018-7-16,1,0,0
"Lasted 7 months and now it no longer stays on for more than 3-5 minutes despite being plugged in. Was used all 7 months in an office setting, barely moved.

"This is the first one of these i have ever bought so I was a little put off by the smallness of it. I have since come to realize that it is an average size for the price. The sound is ok; i use mainly with my phone so i added a bass booster app because some recordings need it. It is reasonably loud for say, bathroom use, and i dropped it a few times in the shower into standing water with no ill effects. If i were a more serious music head i would probably get a bigger one, but the quality is fine. I mostly use it to listen to podcasts and music at my desk at work, in the shower or around the house like when I'm cleaning. Good quality, bluetooth has never failed to connect and sound is consistent.",4,1,2018-8-28,1,0,1

"I was looking for a speaker for my tablet which just does not create anough volume for when I want to work out for example with streaming videos. When looking for a bluetooth speaker I was a bit worried that whatever I get would never create good enough sound or volume but the oontz had favorable reviews and was very inexpensive so I got it. It exceeds my expectations by far. The sound is clean, there is enough bass to make it sound like a serious little boom box and the volume is definetely sufficient. At this price this speaker is a steal. I did not try the mic yet or used it for phone calls but for playing music it sure rocks.",5,1,2016-3-13,1,0,0

Have used this a lot.  All day use and battery keeps going. Sound quality good - not great - but compact digital speakers are not for high fidelity sessions.  You have to buy a carrying case separately.  I found that a Crown Royal whiskey bag works just as well.  Enjoy,4,1,2019-7-12,1,1,0

However, most people I know with a portable speaker that didn't cost a fortune are already impressed by this little sound beast. Battery life is impressive (I'm pushing the 4-5 hour mark and my phone reports its holding around 20-25% battery). I've listened to bass driven music, baseball radio broadcast and everything in between. Sound quality stands up to the test of it all, even at higher volumes.

"I love everything about this speaker except for one thing. Unfortunately, the one thing is that it is a complete pain to charge this thing. There seems exactly one sweet spot where the cord and the speaker connect and will actually charge. It can take a very long time to find the sweet spot. Then, it will only hold the sweet spot for a few seconds unless, by some miracle, the forces of the universe align and it will actually charge as it is supposed it. Additionally, this problem seems to be getting worse.",4,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0

It doesn't roll around, it quickly connects to my phone, the battery capacity is sufficient (I haven't drained it completely yet), and it has great sound for a small speaker. Don't expect subwoofer bass from it, though - it's not meant for thudding low frequency sound although it does project fairly low tones without any rattles. Good for music, news, marine weather, podcasts, and phone conversations with its built in microphone. I didn't expect much for what I paid but I'm very happy with this speaker.",5,1,2016-4-4,1,0,0

But, since this was meant to be something for my wife, who doesn't care so much about great sound, I thought it was worth trying out.  She likes to have some background music going when doing projects around the house, and the Oontz Angle 3 is great for that.  It sounds good, has a nice clean build, and is simple to set up.  We got a little bit of static when the bluetooth device got too far from the speaker, but I think that is the limitation of bluetooth, not a faulty design.  We have not attempted to charge it yet, since we've only had it for 2 days, but the original charge has held up so far (3 or 4 hours of playing time).  I'm happy.",5,1,2016-12-27,1,0,0

"This Bluetooth speaker had an very good rating (4-1/2 stars) with nearly 21,000 results.

"Very loud, I honestly didn’t think it would be as loud as it is. I’ve used it on and off for a couple hours a day and have only charged it for the initial out of the box charge, that was 3 weeks ago. Would for sure buy it again if it stopped working",5,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0

The speaker was very easy to set up that sounds great for such a small speaker. It pairs up nicely with this case at a relatively good price. It has a nice feel to it in the controls are easy to use. I would buy another one if needed.,5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0

"Purchased this Bluetooth speaker for my teenage daughter Christmas of 2017. She loves the speaker and takes it everywhere with her. You won't be disappointed as this small speaker packs a big punch. At times, I have to tell my daughter to turn down the volume due to how loud the speaker can get. Haven't tested the water resistant feature but that's another added bonus in my opinion.Great buy for under $30!",5,1,2018-1-2,1,0,0
"I bought the first version of the Angle. It has functioned well for about two years but the sound is not the greatest. I bought the Angle 3 for about the same price as the original version, and it is infinitely better. The sound is very good, in both volume and clarity. It apparently has a bass function that the original model did not have. The functions, like Bluetooth syncing, are perfect. The rubberized exterior is convenient. The sound doesn't beat my daughter's Bose model, but it is comparable for a fraction of the cost. Love the Angle 3.",5,1,2016-1-29,1,0,0
"The sound quality on this is better than I expected.  It's no Beats pill or Bose, but it's also not hundreds of dollars.  The size is fantastic, though.  Small, slim, not too noticable, and very portable.  We sometimes use this in the car if the stereo goes out, and it's good for parties, too.  Battery lasts forever and a day.  We've never had it go out during use; we just charge it afterward.  Overall, I recommend it if you want a good little speaker without breaking the bank.",4,1,2016-12-27,1,0,0
This Bluetooth speaker is definitely worth the money. We bought this for our 12 year old daughter for Christmas and bought a more expensive Bluetooth speaker for our 15 year old daughter and this one is by far more superior in sound quality!

"This speaker can fill a 2 person apartment complex pretty well and it certainly does the job for me. The sound quality is nice and the bass is clean... unless you turn it to max volume. However, that has been my experience for most speakers / car audio when you blast the music at full volume. For the price, you can't argue this. Bluetooth range 4/5, Volume 5/5, Sound quality 4/5.

"This little thing BUMPS! No joke, the passive subwoofer on this thing goes to work. The sound is crystal clear, with great highs, mids and lows. Charged it up as soon as I received it to get the best possible yield from this device. For the sake of comparison, I own a Logitech Ultimate Ears Megaboom (Which is about $200) and this little thing strongly contends with it as the Megaboom is nearly twice the size of the Angle 3. So $30 for this is a steal and a tremendous value.",5,1,2016-3-3,1,1,0
I bought this for my husband to use with his iphone. He loves it. The sound quality is pretty amazing for such a small speaker. He was able to get it connected to his blue tooth quickly and easily. I couldn't expect more for the price.,5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"I own the OontZ Angle 3, after 3 months of use the device would not turn off while the blue light continued flashing. The device would not conntct with any other device while blue light flashed. The manual directions stated “either a toothpick or straightened paper clip into the AUX IN jack until it makes contact with the micro switch.  Gently push and release the switch and the speaker will reset.” I attempted this reset; however, I could not feel any micro switch using a toothpick or paperclip. I opened the device, link below; I found there is NO micro switch on the circuit board. To reset the device I unsoldered the + battery terminal on the circuit board, this will give the exact response as a reset button. Waited 30 sec, finger pinched the + wire to the board with my right hand, pressed the on button with my left hand. The device worked as normal,  I soldered the + wire to the circuit board, screwed it back together, its working as new again. Takes about 10min, using a small and micro Phillips screwdriver and a PC board soldering iron. Hope this helps somebody in the world.",3,1,2017-1-7,1,0,0
"This little thing rocks.  You have to keep your expectations realistic, of course it won't sound like a THX 7.1 system.  However, for being such a small and cheap speaker, I was pleasantly surprised.  My wife and I put some Avenged Sevenfold on and sit in the hot tub and this is pretty clearly heard over the jets, and we don't even turn it up all the way.  It can handle being outside in the cold and getting splashed just fine too.  It doesn't give you a lot of bass in the music, but nothing this small could do that so you shouldn't expect it to.",5,1,2015-12-3,1,0,0
Nice little speaker for $28. It charged quickly from my PC. It pared with my phone and PC without hesitation. It plays loud very well and didn't distort when pushed. Music with a heavy beat does surprisingly well for such a little package. Highs are clear. This speaker moves a lot of air. Nice quality of construction. Feels like you are holding something substantial. Very appealing to the eye. Might buy another at this price.,5,1,2016-6-21,1,1,0
I hate having to shut it off every time my boys hook it up to thier Bluetooth devices. Kills the battery fast. Don’t waste your time just buy an anker they are better and don’t have this issue. Anker is not water resistant but let’s be real your not going to bring this any real water situations that’s not what it is made for. If you can keep it plugged in which in my opinion defeats the purpose it’s an ok device. I missed my time frame to return it now I’m stuck with it.,2,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"The sound on this speaker is fine, no complaints there.  But if you have it plugged into the music source and power source at the same time it has way too much static.  The instructions even state this may be an issue.  Plus if it is not plugged into the power source it automatically turns off every 15 minutes to reserve the battery.  I bought this for my desk at work and I use my computer speaker instead because this is such a pain.",1,1,2018-12-31,1,1,0
UPDATE: After writing my first the review the company contacted me to discuss replacing the speaker.  They sent a new one and so far it is working great!

Only complaint - which was addressed by Cambridge 1 month after the Amazon return window - the micro USB port seems fragile even with care inserting the plug.  The speaker quite charging and new cables were tried.  I have seen similar failures in other devices so somewhat unavoidable since these sockets are so widely used.  Even if Cambridge wasn't so responsive at this price for the sound and Bluetooth seamless connection you could buy one as a spare.,5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0

My only complaint is that it will vibrate itself off the edge of a table if the volume is too high, I solve that by standing it on its side. Sound quality is great for the size.",5,1,2016-12-19,1,0,0
Excellent sound quality.  I paired it with my Echo Dot and the content came to life.  This speaker fills the kitchen with rich sounds while virtually taking up no space.,5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
I can sit this little speaker in center hall and hear it in every room. I do plan on purchasing a 2nd for convenience and so that my Bluetooth signal doesn't drop at the farthest ends of the house.,5,1,2018-10-9,1,1,0
"This little speaker worked well for a while. It’s not the loudest, but for $20 I didn’t expect it to be. It’s still sounds alright, but it only seems to last a few hours now. Also, it doesn’t play nice with my XS Max. I have to forget the speaker and search for it again because it won’t pair automatically with it.",3,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
"Sound is decent and I have no connectivity issues. I have used this while on a walk and as a short-term replacement for car stereo. It got wet in my backpack when I forded a waist-high river - it still works pretty well but this guy is definitely not waterproof, though it is somewhat water-resistant. I wish it had a loop for a carabiner or other attachment. Overall, it is a fine speaker. I might spend more money on my next speaker though.",4,1,2017-11-27,1,0,0

"This is my second OontZ speaker in two years. You can't beat the sound quality for the price, but the first speaker lasted only 14 months.

"I have usually been charging it daily but all of a sudden it no longer charges. It doesn't light up that it's charging after I plug it in in the charger. When I turn it on, it just blinks a few times and automatically turns off. I don't think its really charging so looking at options to maybe replace the speaker with a working one. This is the second or third speaker I've been through over the summer. Other speakers aren't as loud as this one, which was good originally, but all of a sudden not really working with my charger and/or Bluetooth. Possibly, the Bluetooth cable connection got chipped off when I went to plug it in the other week or so.",3,1,2017-10-23,1,0,0

"My husband absolutely loves this little speaker! It's extremely easy to set-up and quickly connects to any device in seconds. It's a very evenly balanced sound between the treble and bass. It can get pretty loud, so it's nice to be able to control the volume both on your phone and on the side, just in case the speaker is closer than your phone is. Going to pick up a few more to link together so we can listen throughout the house!",5,1,2017-1-12,1,1,0
"The unit sounded great out of the box and it has been handled gently since then.  Within 10 uses there is an electrical problem with the sound, including static, no base, hollow and electrical popping.  Very poor construction for a unique design.  If they are willing to repair or send a new unit I'll try it again to see if I just received a bad product.",1,1,2019-4-13,1,1,0
"This is very much worth it. I bought one as a mini soundbar for my TV & computer, portable enough to reduce volume & hold in my hand or lap when it gets late at night so as not to annoy my neighbors in the apartment complex. It reduces a lot of wires & clutter from my setup, too.",5,1,2017-2-27,1,3,0

But right now I am using my husband's email since he's got the prime but I did order some again from his account . Must be nice if they get me a extra speaker prize for this 🤣 since I have ordered so many of this.  This is a real review! I am completely inlove and satisfied with this little speaker.  I wish they make more with the colored speaker",5,1,2017-5-18,1,0,0

I've always just used headphones and listened to my iPhone, until now.The first time I used this speaker, it was amazing! Talk about a total game changer. The volume options are perfect, and the sound is so clear. I was so excited and happy, about this electronic purchase, that I told all my family and friends about how amazing it is! I later purchased one for each of them.",2,1,2018-2-1,1,4,0

"A Bluetooth speaker should be as simple as pairing and using. This is NOT the case with the speaker. It paired with my tablet just fine, but the volume SUCKS.

I paid shipping, it arrived, I charged it, and then it would not turn on.After spending money on the original one, plus shipping, and then shipping on the second one, I wish I had just bought a higher quality bluetooth speaker to begin with.",1,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0

"After a friend showed and demonstrated to me her Oontz Angle 3, I was surprised by the quality of the sound, for such a small speaker size, and ordered one for myself. After receiving mine it was easy to set up, but, I was initially disappointed with the low sound volume, when turning up volume on the unit. I later discovered the actual sound was mostly controlled by my phone volume, and ended up having to turn it down. For the price the sound is great.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0

I can't say enough good things about this speaker. It gets extremely loud and the sound quality is great. It was super easy to pair to my phone.

This little stick of dynamite has a big bang. My two boys own Bluetooth speakers by another company and paid nearly 2 hundred each for them.

"Wow. Awesome little speaker that worked within seconds of pulling it out of the box. No need to charge it or read directions.The Amazon price of $28 was a steal. This tiny but powerful speaker has good, clear sound, bass that made the table vibrate and and excellent volume.

Can't beat this deal!",5,1,2016-7-4,1,1,0

Easy to carry as you walk around, feels sturdy in your hands. It also holds a decent charge - we used this to watch 3-4 movies on a single charge. There are a few design flaws, for instance, the flap that covers the ports is very flimsy. Have used this for about 3 months so far, let's see how it holds up!",5,1,2016-10-7,1,0,0

I was surprised by the quality for the cost.",4,1,2018-4-2,1,0,0

The only problem I face sometimes is that I have to disconnect the speaker from the device that I last used it on before I can connect it to another device! I wish they had a more simple way of switching from one bluetooth device to another, but that's why i gave this a 4 star rather than a 5 star. Other than that problem, I love it!

"I ordered this because there were several good/great reviews.  When I got the speaker it connected to my phone with ease, but it woulnd't stay connected.  It would connect for anywhere between 30 seconds and 5 minutes.  The only way to reconnect it was to wait for the speaker to turn itself off when it hadn't been used.  It would not reconnect by turning it off and back on or by rebooting my phone.  It did have good sound quality when it was connected or if it was directly connected with the 18 inch headphone cable - but the point of a Bluetooth speaker is to be more than a foot and a half away from it.",2,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0

"Well, I just found my speaker inside my freezer and it still works great. Have been using this for a couple months now and can’t complain about this speaker. I work overnights and using headphones can get in the way and rip out of my ears. Grabbed this speaker on Black Friday for $5 off. It’s loud enough to hear an isle or two over without being a nusiance to other people. The bass is a little lacking but the size more than makes up for it. Portable enough to be crammed inside a Jean pocket or jacket pocket and form factor of an iPhone. Works well enough a couple coworkers were impressed to order one for themselves. Battery life is pretty good. 8 hours of pretty much maxed volume listening to rock and today’s hits. 10/10 recommend.",5,1,2018-1-4,1,0,0

"This review has a happy ending. I purchased this speaker from Amazon primarily to listen to audiobooks and podcasts. I based my purchase on the excellent reviews and price. However once I received the unit, and (easily) paired it to my iPhone via bluetooth, I noticed that there were odd lapses in my audiobook playback - the sound seemed to fade in and out. It was almost nauseating to listen to. I searched the other reviews on Amazon and found other audiobook listeners had similar problems. Based on the suggestion of another customer I contacted Cambridge Soundworks directly, via their website. They replied to my email within the hour, and shipped out an upgraded speaker immediately, at no cost to me. And it works perfectly! As a note on quality, I have tried several other well-reviewed, affordable speakers and have been disappointed by the lack of clarity. They have sounded muffled. Probably great for music, but not spoken word. The clarity of voice on this speaker is very clear. It's not QUITE as crisp as my ideal if price were not an issue but at this price point, this speaker is a keeper. Moral of the story: If your speaker has lapses in audiobook/podcast playback, contact Cambridge Soundworks (even if you didn't purchase it directly from them), and they'll send you a speaker that doesn't have that bug.",5,1,2016-5-29,1,0,0

"I havent had experience with this type of speaker before. Mainly because I enjoy my living room stereo speaker setup which is modest but i love the sound. Two decent bookshelf  speakers a decent amp and sub. I used to live in a studio apartment and this is all i needed. I recently moved into a one bedroom and couldn't here my morning  playlist from my living room to the bathroom in the bed room. I purchased this speaker completely on a whim, primarily due to the Cambridge Soundworks name. I am not naive and i understand they more than likely purchase this Chinese speaker and slap their name on it.  That being said, for the money I paid, it is a serviceable speaker. Its sound doesn't excel in any particular area but that is fine. I would call the sound neutral but i would also call it slightly tiny. It is an upgrade from computer speakers and smartphone speakers. An upgrade that i would highly recommend to anyone. For being this small and at a price many can afford, it is hard to imagine a better speaker for the money. I cringe when I see these no name companies that call their product ""Ispeaker"" or ""Isound"" or whatever and sell it for nothing. I have had this for 2 months and a syns to my bluetooth flawlessly, plays decent sound while I am showering, and then powers off automatically when I leave the house for work and am out of range. I wouldnt bring it inside the shower but for a bathroom counter companion, it is more than welcome. In the two months I have owned it, I have used it maybe 40 days which works out to 50 cents a day which to me, is money well spent. I can guarantee that it is better than similarly priced bluetooth speakers and has a name behind it. I would say it is close to the 100 dollar sony i was considering. It gets 4 stars and I would purchase again or give as a gift.",4,1,2015-11-28,1,0,0
Just love it ...would give it a four and one half star if I could .....the only thing I could see that  needs some changes is the fact that the black on black of the controls are very difficult to see.  'The sound is wonderful....just used it on a road trip and was able to hear my podcasts over the loud noise of the bad roads.,4,1,2018-6-13,1,0,0
"I bought this to block outside noise in a camper while sleeping and let me tell you, it's LOUD. If I connect it to my phone, someone could be running a lawnmower under my window and I wouldn't hear it!",5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It has great sound and long range. We do not let our kids take their devices in their bedrooms but she found she can leave her phone downstairs with music playing and take the speaker in her room upstairs and it stays connected. It is a small price to pay to make a teenage girl and her mother happy.,5,1,2018-1-11,1,0,0
"We've been looking for a wireless speaker for a little while and based on reviews and price, settled on the OontZ Angle 3. We couldn't be happier. It quickly and easily links via Bluetooth to a variety of sources and plays music as long and as loud as we ask. We had a question for the seller and contacted Cambridge SoundWorks directly. Their customer service actually tops their speaker for responsiveness. Our concern was addressed promptly and completely. Very satisfied! Buy this speaker or anything else from Cambridge SoundWorks with confidence, knowing their products are 100% backed by the company.",5,1,2016-10-3,1,1,0

Love it.  Sounds great for the size and much louder than we expected. Louder and better sound than the others we tried in similar size.  like that it is triangular for the positions we set it in.  Take everywhere without fear of getting it wet or ruined.  Thin rubber coating around it gives good grip.  Battery lasts much longer that we anticipated as well.,5,1,2018-1-22,1,0,0
"Prime Day deal on this speaker was too good to pass up, especially when I needed one within a week for a trip I was planning.  Easy connectivity with tablet and phone, and sound is excellent for a lower priced speaker!",5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
"The battery life is somewhat suspect but the really awful thing is that sometimes the sound becomes muffled and the sound quality is atrocious.  At first, I thought it was the connectivity or just a one time thing but when it connects to Bluetooth for my Mac every other time the sound quality is extremely poor.If you leave a review right when you get it you wont know these things.

I guess for a little over $20 it’s good but don’t expect it to last long. I used mine intermittently and it just konked out after a year. Another hunk of garbage to add to the landfill.I still have my Soundfreaq Sound Rise from 2014 and its still going strong and sounds great.,3,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
"For the first month I was very happy with this speaker. It sounded good for its size, and the battery lasted a long time. Bluetooth pairing and connectivity was never a problem. But then, as I now see has been noted in other reviews, the USB charging port got loose and wiggly, and I could no longer get it to charge. I even tried duct taping a USB cable to it, but still couldn't get it to charge. The device is now a silent paperweight.",1,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0

The first month - this speaker was GREAT. Started having Bluetooth connectivity issues. Constantly had to disconnect and reconnect. Then started having sound quality issues.  Needed to have volume at 100% to hear anything...and sometimes it was just static.  Was hoping to replace wired speakers on my laptop...but I'm back to the wired speakers. They never fail me.,1,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
I did a little bit of research and narrowed the list of portable speakers in the 25-40 price range to three.  I decided on this one based on popularity and reviews and was very pleased with it once I tried it out.  Connecting is easy and its range is great.  The volume was enough to receive a noise complaint while outside at a mart and is more than enough for a large room or for outside use.  The sound quality and bass do not crack for most songs I have listened to even at max.,5,1,2016-11-6,1,0,0

"With the inadequate sound quality of my phone and laptop, I wanted a bluetooth speaker. After some research, I ended up buying this one. It may not blow you away or bring the house down, but it can get decently loud, it comes through clear, the distance a device can be from this speaker to keep signal is excellent, and the battery life is amazing.  Very good buy.",5,1,2017-12-28,1,0,0
"Good sound for streaming musicOnly complaint: the speaker phone feature is awful; anyone else in the call can't hear you, and the output is bad as well.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"The first time I turned this speaker on, I had to look around the room to see where the music was actually COMING from.  I figured my boys were playing a practical joke on me.  When I finally ACCEPTED the fact that this astonishing noise was truly being emitted by the little, black, $21 triangle I had recently purchased from Amazon, I felt that I must have wandered into some kind of a time capsule, or something:  I mean, this clarion sound just didn't seem possible in the context of present-day acoustical physics.  Having received no superior explanation since my purchase was completed, however, I continue to believe that my Oontz Angle has somehow transported both of us into the distant future, where it regularly salutes my ear-drums with voices stentorian.  Today -- with my Oontz beside me -- I feel like anything is possible, and it is no exaggeration to say that its recent acquisition is among the most important events of an already-extraordinary life.",5,1,2017-9-28,1,0,0
"This is a little device with a big sound! I recently purchased an Echo Dot but continue to move it to different areas in my home. So I wanted a small, inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that was equally as portable.  Based on the other reviews, I went with the OontZ Angle 3. What a great choice. It was perfect for my needs! Love the booming sound in such a small package. I'm so happy with this purchase that I just bought another one, along with the carrying case.",5,1,2017-2-10,1,0,0
"Terrible wireless stereo. Don't get me wrong, it sounds amazing, but the biggest set back is the range. I am not sure if my device was defective, but whenever my device, that was connected to this speaker, was placed a foot or more away from the speaker, the audio would start breaking up. The range in description is closer to 5 feet, but at 5 feet, it basically stops playing music. At 1 feet distance, there is an audio breakup every 5 to 10 sec, at 2 feet it breaks off at 3 secs and at 3+ feet it completely gives out even when fully charged... I filed a return for this device.",2,1,2017-11-25,1,1,0
So happy with this purchase.  Bought it for my new cook job in a restaurant kitchen and all the cooks use it!  Everyone at work is so happy and keeps thanking me for buying it!  Battery lasts even though we use it 24/7.No problems yet.  Going on fourth week!,5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
This speaker fits my purpose and expectations reasonably well.  The small and unobtrusive size is great and I like the looks.  It feels solid and seems to be built well.  I haven't used the Bluetooth connection yet and I have it plugged in so I can't comment on the battery life.  It came with an aux 3.5mm cable and a USB charging cable.I mainly bought this to go with my Echo Dot.  The sound is a great improvement over the Dot's tinny speaker and that makes it worth it to me and that earns it 4 stars. The biggest drawback of this speaker is the weak bass. That's the sole reason it lost a star.,4,1,2017-1-16,1,0,0

"Oh, this thing is so cool, I could not believe my ears.After ordering this thing pretty much blind, I went back on the website to dry to figure out why such an inexpensive speaker sounded so good, and ended up buying the ""Plus"" version as well. Both are great. I use them out on the deck while I read. No wires, no hassles, great sound, just running Napster through my iPhone paired up with the Oontz. Very, very cool little speaker. The plus does have a bit more oomph. Sometimes we get just the right thing!",5,1,2017-8-2,1,0,0
"Terrible I bought it November 21st.  When I started using it it wouldn't hold a charge for more than a day. I should have returned it then.

We LOVE this little speaker.  DO NOT let the size fool you.  We can hear this speaker all over our entire house!  And set up was literally turning Bluetooth on and selecting Ooontz.  Done.

The speakers sounds is wonderful. The picture makes it look larger than what it is.  It is about 6 inches long very short. I didn’t mind because the sound is great.  But it is short.  I use an Apple IPad. The sound is weak on the pad so the speaker gives me great sound. Plus I can take this outside.  Great product for the price your paying.,5,1,2018-5-10,1,0,0
This tiny speaker packs quite a punch. I bought one for our Polaris General side by side. It fits perfectly in the little open area. I even bought a second one of these for my 18 year old son to give to him along with his graduation gift.,5,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"Great sound for money. Best if can place in corner so bass can reflect better. If you want to make changes to sound, be sure make note of default because this probably sounds better than you could tune.  Its not Bose, but sounds good enough for wife to come close the door.

"You can't expect this to sound like a Bose, a Sony, or a KEF Muo. But for a $20 speaker it sounds good enough. This seems to be well-built and I like the rubbery texture. Not enough bass for me personally, and it can't be played loud or there's some distortion.Note:  A couple weeks after receiving this, I had a few margaritas. It deserved 5 stars then.",4,1,2018-6-20,1,0,0
This speaker was a waste of money.  It can not even be heard above normal volume conversations.  I thought that maybe I needed to charge it for better sound quality instead of leaving it plugged in during use.  This did not help either.,1,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"Love this little speaker! Works perfectly for smaller activities. Need to mop the kitchen floor? Choose your favorite tunes and motivation abounds. Need to wash your car?

"I bought a Sony SRS-X3 speaker on sale from Best Buy about a month ago for $70. It crackled at the high notes of Bach's Kyrie Eleison, and it distorted heavily for the bass of E Nomine's Mitternacht. I returned it, and got this.It doesn't crack during Kyrie, and it doesn't have a death rattle during Mitternacht. It doesn't have quite the fullness of sound that the Sony had (that is, when it wasn't sounding like it was going to come apart), but for fifty dollars less, this speaker's a marvel.",4,1,2015-11-16,1,0,0

"At this point I have to give up on it, and therefore I'm giving it 1 star.It doesn't consistently connect after a few months.  I have it synced to only one computer, and when that computer turns off - the speaker stops being connected.  That is obvious and should be how it is.  However when the computer comes back on, the speaker doesn't reconnect to it automatically.  I have to turn the speaker off and then turn the speaker back on for it to sometimes reconnect (about 75% of the time).  None of their support or manual material covers this issue for troubleshooting.",1,1,2018-9-1,1,0,0
It connects well. What I do not like is that if you turn volume off and then shut off power when it is powered on again it comes on at full volume. Also I would have preferred a knob turn on rather than a difficult to push button.,3,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0

If you are reading this please save yourself some time and invest little more money in more premium brand. The whole purpose of buying a bluetooth stereo is to go wireless.

I got the first, but the sound is still pretty tinny -- almost no bass -- and when I crank up the volume a bit, there's a good deal of distortion on the high end. For listenting to a podcast, it'd be fine. For music...not so great. I should have figured that something that's only about 5"" long wouldn't really produce a lot of bass, alas.

"Given the low price, I was reluctant. It does not have the greatest sound, but my wife is happy and it turns on and off w/o drama so it's a keeper.  I was able to use with my Android phone and her Iphone whereas a unit my daughter bought wouldn't see my Android.",5,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
"these speakers are excellent. I have been researching bluetooth speakers for a while and a friend had these and i was quite pleased. I didn't hear about OontZ before and i was more leaning on buying a JBL. Just got the Oontz and i must say the quality of sound is excellent. obviously you can't expect the experience of a five piece surround sound but this little guy is surprisingly loud, crisp and clean. the size is perfect and neat. I just love it and will recommend strongly.",5,1,2017-6-4,1,0,0
Having previously owned a Soundlink III Bose speaker this little guy is slightly disappointing. Battery life is excellent and I have never had the speaker run down completely. It connects to my IPhone in less than 5 seconds.,4,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
"Have had this for a couple of months, and it has grown on me.  The battery life is good, the sound is good, and it has taken a beating.  I'd call it a good value.  Don't expect chest-thumping bass, but this does have a bass port on the bottom and when placed right you can get a full sound out of it.  Great for grab and go when I want to go down and sit on the dock and crack a cold one while enjoying some tunes.",5,1,2017-6-14,1,0,0

"The sound quality on this speaker is very so so. No bass to round out the sound. I purchased this to replace a UE Boom that is starting to act up - there is no comparison to the quality.  If you want a cheap speaker that you can listen to sound this is for you.  I really feel suckered by all the 5 star, alleged audiophile reviews on here. ""It's a BEAST!""  Really?  Not hardly. As far as the battery and bluetooth goes I gave it a 5, dont really know because I returned it the day after Christmas.",2,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"Sounds great, and was much louder than I thought for the size of the speaker. Lasted for eight hours at an event I had and still had power left. Only downfall is I couldn’t move my phone further than 10 ft away before it would disconnect the Bluetooth.",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0

"Both the Amazon product description and the packaging quick start guide indicated that this includes both Micro-USB charging cable and a 3.5mm audio cable.  These were not included with the speaker.  Fortunately, I have these cables from other electronic products that work interchangeably.  The speaker is good and not worth the effort to return just for these missing cables.  Just lack of quality control I am sure.",2,1,2017-1-8,1,1,0
Bought this for my daughter cause of the stats and other reviews but am unimpressed. The build quality seems good but that means nothing when at medium volume the music has a crackling in the backgound and the bluetooth to her echo dot barely reaches accrossed her small bedroom,3,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0

"Just got it and paired it with my PC and I'm very happy with it so far.  Good volume, bass, and overall sound.  The 10W of power seems good for a PC speaker to me.  The quality of the unit seems good and not cheaply made despite being only $24.Update: July 26, 2018:  This hasn't paired/worked in a long time.  It did in the beginning but went downhill after that.",1,1,2017-12-1,1,0,0
"Used it in the shower (as it's specifically advertised for) and it stopped working. It was off to the side and barely got splashed. Also, the soldering worked loose after a few months so that it only charged if the cable was held in a certain way.

"This little bug is a ""Cambridge Sound Works"" wireless Bluetooth speaker that delivers a BIG sound in a very portable and easily used device. The reason I went with this little guy was because I am VERY familiar with the quality of CSW and let me tell you. I have used BOSE exclusively for decades and this speaker MEETS if not exceeds the quality of sound and convenience for a MUCH more reasonable price. thank you!",5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"Decent sound, easy pairing, but stopped working after about 6 months of light use. After about 6 months, the music would stream from my phone (via Bluetooth) to the speaker, then all of a sudden, the speaker’s sound cuts off. The device still has power, so the website says that I may need a new motherboard for the speaker. I thought this speaker would last more than 6 months. Disappointing.",3,1,2017-10-17,1,1,0

"Great sound for the price point. Connects via Bluetooth easily. Battery lasts pretty long. The highs are crisp and clear, no muffling.

"I have two Oontz Angle speakers. They are an excellent value that bring together quality, price and customer focus. My need for a speaker did not require anything special in sound quality so I was pleasantly surprised b the sound from my Angle 3.

I recommend doing business with these folks.",5,1,2018-4-19,1,0,0
"Have yet to get any computer with bluetooth to even find this thing. Picture on Amazon is a complete deception. It fits in the palm of 1 hand. If I had it to do again, I'd buy JBL. Not this no brand, no name over priced palm speaker.",2,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0

"I like this speaker.  Connects easily and better than that - stays connected! The last brand I bought didnt. As advertised battery life (I am getting more than advertised but I don't have the volumn way up) My only wish was for a bit more bass ability. My last one was a bit more ""boomy"" but then again it would drop the bluetooth mid song. Thanks to my coworkers coffee, I tested its water resistance. Still as good as the day I bought it.",4,1,2017-4-2,1,0,0

"Like this speaker a lot so far. Use it in the car, at home and in locker room. The Bluetooth has paired flawlessly with my iPhone and iPad. The sound quality is good for the size and price.

"It works very well but I needed more volume without using an amplifier.  Some YouTube videos are so poorly done in terms of sound quality, and a more powerful speaker would do the trick.  This one works okay, but I'd like to squeeze more volume out of them if I could.",4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0

"Well I've had this now for oh 3 weeks. The sound quality isn't that of a Bose, But for under $30, It's amazing!!! Can I say that again? It's amazing! I thought I had it on my charger for a few days, but sadly it wasn't. It didn't matter, brought it outside grilling baked potatoes and steaks, it lasted the whole 3 hours from lighting the chimney, to pulling the potatoes off. The bluetooth range is phenomenal, I'd say at least 30 feet, but I haven't tested the limit's of it yet...Over all I like the sound quality. For the size of this unit, and it's extremely low cost you should buy one for everyone in your family!",5,1,2016-7-17,1,1,0
"I love it! Great sound from a small package  I  can carry with me as I travel. There's not one thing I don't like. Bass reflex design means it plays loud, clearly, and with as much bass as I'd expect from a small design. Cambridge did a great job in design of this, and unless you need a bigger badder sound, this  should do the trick for  anyone. I love jazz and classical and it is very accurate and great to listen to with no distortion even at loud levels. Kudos!",5,1,2017-7-6,1,0,0

"Great sound right out of the box.The huge gripe I have is that there are no controls for next and previous songs. Basically renders the point of this device useless. The reason to use this, for me,  is to have music or audio in the shower. Any speaker or device works, but they weren't waterproof or resistant, so I couldn't control them. This is water resistant, but still doesn't  have controls, so it's basically the same setup I've had, but just closer to me.",4,1,2015-11-10,1,0,0

"Bought this as a gift for my husband. Speakers sound great, and the volume is impressive for something around the size of a soup can. We like the sealed nature of the system - perfect for use outside or in the garage (it's intended purpose). Out of the box, it was already charged and lasted for  few days before I charged it up. It uses a standard microUSB port to charge (and comes with a cord). Setting up bluetooth was a breeze from our phones. Overall, a great product for the price.

I have been loving it so far. It’s small but not too small. I didn’t expect the speaker to have the ability to get so loud! It’s incredible, most speakers this size have bad quality sound that comes out. But this speaker has good bass and it sounds amazing with my music I listen to. The Bluetooth is easy to connect. It took 3 seconds to connect the speaker to my phone. I’ll update my experience in a few months to add onto the review. But honestly I recommend this speaker to anyone who has a small budget. It’s affordable and totally worth investing in.Update: 2 Years later and it is still perfect, nothing wrong with it. Holds a charge for a while. Best investment for a speaker for an affordable price!",5,1,2017-11-29,1,0,0
Delivery come right on time for Xmas and I ordered 2 days before. The speaker is easy to hold and the sound for its size is pretty good. It definitely has good base. I got it for my husband to use in his car and inside the car it's perfect not blasting and not too low at max volume. It's definitely louder than using the speaker off your mobile phone.It came with a aux cable but did not come with a cable to charge it. Which is why I gave it 4 stars. It uses a micro usb charger.,4,1,2016-1-4,1,1,1

"The Oontz Angle 3 speaker is a great product for the price. At less than $30, this speaker well built, easy to connect with my iPhone, and has a very good sharp sound for its small size. It has very good bass as well as treble. There is no hissing or distortion at max volume which is surprisingly loud for small speakers. I use this speaker mainly for the kitchen, but it will easily fill the entire lower floor of my house, so you don't have to move the speaker from room to room. Supposedly the speaker should have a Bluetooth range of about 30 feet, but I do get some skipping when I move my phone behind structures such as walls. So I'm guess the 30 foot range is for line of site only.The Angle 3 doesn't have as good a sound as my UE Mini Boom, but the UE Mini Boom is not splash proof, rain proof, sand proof and dust proof, shock resistance, better looking, and definitely not less than $30 (I paid $100 and only keep it in bedroom). The UE is also about twice as heavy. This is a great speaker to take anywhere without worry.",4,1,2015-12-1,1,0,0

"We bought this for a long trip. So far it has been great!  It connects to my phone very easily every time, battery seems to last about 12 hours, and sound quality is better than I expected.

It also is very sturdy, having stood up to being smashed in an over-stuffed suitcase and carted around for a long time in a backpack full of other stuff.",5,1,2018-9-17,1,0,0
"sound is crisp and clear with decent bass. However, I'm rather peeved that this does NOT have buttons so you can skip to the next song etc especially when your phone is not handy when connected via blue-tooth.

"Most small speakers put out a very flat, tinny sound. However, this one completely crushes that perspective. This speaker feels and sounds like you are holding a 2.1 system in your hands. Even on a low volume, a song with a lot of bass will literally make your skin vibrate. The battery life is excellent, as the speaker can usually go all day on a lower volume without having to be charged. I ran it on a full charge at full volume and got roughly 6 hours out of it before the speaker indicated that it needed to be charged, which is very good to know if you are away from a power source.All in all, very, very impressed by the deep, crisp sound that this speaker is capable of. I would highly recommend it to anybody.",5,1,2017-12-17,1,0,0
Sound comes in crackly (if there's such a word). I was swayed by the amount of reviews and badly disappointed. Did not request to return since I threw away the box. I might just pass it down to a willing teenager. I'm bummed that I spent the money.,2,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0

"Amazing sound AND construction quality!  We’ve had this speaker for months, enjoying it in the bathroom—taking it into the shower, etc & have been very happy. However, I was prompted to write this review during our recent vacation to Hawaii, when my 21-month old chucked the speaker from our third floor (!!!) Lanai into the cabana below!!!  It not only survived, but sounds as good as before (after a minor “relodging” of the panels...whereby it beeped happily and resumed full function). Of course the next song we played for our rowdy toddler was “The Day The Music Died.”  Thankfully, the song was for dramatic effect and not actually indicative of the rest of our vacation. Ironically, the first song pandora played next was “Gravity”.  Hahahaha!!  Bottom line:  Buy this—you won’t regret it!",5,1,2017-12-29,1,0,0

Sound quality poor and plug in to keep it charged wont stay in the speaker. The connection is very loose and I've only had for a little over a month...so cant return it of course!

first one was dead - amazon gave me a refund - then Cambridge sent me a replacement that works perfect and a carry case for it free of charge- it has a good sound for its size - I can hear the bass and treble - sounds laud as a small table radio - good for one room - good for portable sound you can carry in your backpack -  large pockets or purse- Dorm room - I can hear it 30 feet away - its not a boom box so don't complain they have Bluetooth boomers just pay $300. - dollars and you have one,5,1,2016-4-27,1,0,0
"We LOVE this portable speaker.  It's portable (small).  The sound is amazing for such a small device.  And it's waterproof!  I have used it outside while doing yardwork, in the shower, while doing chores around the house, etc. It lasts a LONG time between charges, too.

"This little speaker is awesome. I take it to work and it is better than the computer speakers. While it does get pretty loud that isn't what I bought it for. The Bluetooth feature allows me to hook my phone up to it and then put the phone away in a drawer for safekeeping.I have never had any connection issues. It connects fast and maintains the connection. Can pick up calls and be used as a speaker phone but I've never used that feature. I take this speaker to the barn with me and I don't worry about it getting dirty, I brush it off and it's good as new. I have to say, that while the base is a bit light and the upper registers can cause some ear fatigue with extended listening in close proximity, this is a great speaker for the price.",5,1,2016-2-16,1,1,0
I'm not sure why this speaker is a best seller. I've bought a few different bluetooth speakers from amazon now all in the $30-$45 price range and Oontz has been one of my least favorite. I only used my first Oontz angle a dozen or so times before it stopped charging. Cambridge replaced it immediately for which i gave them an extra star due to great customer service. The battery lasts longer than other speakers (8-10hrs). It has good sound quality but the max volume is quieter compared to other options at similar price. There is also a good bluetooth range. Hopefully the 2nd speaker lasts longer than the first.,4,1,2016-9-2,1,0,0
"I tried to like this speaker but ended up sending it back. Poor volume even with my phone or MP3 player set to max. Could barely hear it while driving.

"I purchased this as a smaller alternative to the TDK Life on Record A33 (which has worked nicely for the past 4 years, but is big and heavy, and little heavy on the bass). I am very pleased with OontZ Angle 3. This little unit deliver a surprisingly balanced tone, reasonably bright and with solid bass but not overwhelming. And, for such a small unit, it produces a lot of volume with little distortion. It easily fills my living room with sound. Bluetooth sets up and links easily to my phone. For $28, this is a very good buy. Have only had it for two weeks, so I can't speak to reliability. (This was a regular retail purchase; I am not a sponsored reviewer).",5,1,2016-5-24,1,0,0

Again, no complaints; it sound ok, but it is just a decent speaker with average volume and bass for its size.",3,1,2017-1-1,1,1,0

I have used this Bluetooth speaker for 2 years now and currently still using it. It does it’s job very much well and everything it advertised. The connection distance is the biggest down side to this version because if I am three rooms down it will loose connection but the newer version say they have improved this so that’s great thing it’s been upgraded that being said I recommend this product if you are going to be near your Bluetooth speaker but if not you should get the newer versions.,4,1,2018-11-8,1,0,0

Bought this with some trepidation.  I had previously bought Bluetooth speakers before for 3x the price with less than favorable outcomes. I bought this unit to take on a cruise so as to have music in our cabin.  VERY happy with the quality and sound range!  Great volume and battery life.  Used it in the cabin and on our balcony.  We could never crank it all the way because it was loud and we had neighbors.  Small.  Lightweight.  Sound disproportionately large from such a relatively small package. Perfect for travel music!,5,1,2015-11-26,1,0,0

"Ok, I originally purchased this speaker because a speaker I had bought at Staples fell apart on me. It arrived on schedule and connected easily. Turned it on and WOW, sounded awesome!! Loud and clear. I am somewhat of a bull in a china store (clumsy) and so I dropped it a few times (reason why my other speaker fell apart..lol) and it held up like a champ. Then some creepy person stole my Oontz, so I reordered it but before it shipped I got suckered into buying another speaker (DOSS) so I canceled it. Needless to say, the other speaker was crap compared to my Oontz. So after 2 weeks I've had it with the DOSS, am returning it, and immediately ordering another Oontz (maybe the ULTRA this time). I will NEVER go with another speaker. I love Oontzie baby...till death do us part.",5,1,2017-12-31,1,0,0

"I normally don't do reviews but this time I decided to because this little thing is amazing. I honestly could not believe something so small could put out as much bass as it could. Now keep in mind it is not earth shattering but considering the size it is simply amazing sound quality. I have not run down the battery yet so I do not know how long it lasts yet. I did not give it a five for a single reason, a friend showed me his of a different brand and his can control the tracks on the phone. More like a 4.8 rating. He also paid five times more for his though. Love Amazon prime, literally got it in 2 days flat. I got this as a deal of the day and was blown away by the cost vrs quality.

It’s an older pickup- a v10 and it’s a BEAST. I wanted to make sure whatever we got was portable and loud enough to hear over the roar of our engine without distortion. I have to say this little speaker does the trick! It’s super loud, and has a rich sound for being such a small speaker. There isn’t any distortion that I can hear, even on songs that are very bass-y.

I am always skeptical about most reviews I have read about this product.  The price was low so I was willing to try it out.  Very pleased.  The battery life has so far been as advertised and sound quality is more than acceptable.  The volume does not go up as high as I thought it would (about a 6 or 7 sound level if compared to a tv).  but at the highest levels the sound remains clear and true without breaking.  I have had the device for about 1 month so I hope it remains as functional many years later as it does today.,5,1,2015-11-28,1,0,0

All the lights are on as normal the devices seem to want to connect again but keep failing. Then after 15 to 20 minutes it’s back. No explanation, nothing special was done. Especially frustrating if your music ends while washing your dishes or on the toilet, it causes an urgency to clean up and get something going again within 20 seconds or they’ll stop talking. Also no alert to let you know the connection was dropped. I leave my phone home with media playing if I have to run to the bodega real quick, then I rewind to what I missed.

As someone who isn't a bass heavy guy but enjoys it in songs, this is the only reason why I'm giving the Angle 4 stars.

They were started by Henry Kloss a famous audio engineer with a number of reputable audio companies behind him, one of the 1st company's to separate the bass speaker from the others so it could be put on the floor &  out of sight if you preferred. I bought a set of CSW speakers in the early 90's & a smaller set for the porch later on they still sound great & still get compliments on the sound.

"After reading the great reviews and noting that excellent value.  On sale for ~$27, I made the purchase.  When I received it, seemed to work great out of the box.  I wanted it for my treadmill, and I figured with the sweat proofing and compact design that fit perfectly in my console tray, it was the way to go.  I used it for the first day and was very happy with everything.  However, after plugging it in to give it a full charge, it would never make sound again.  I tried the audio jack and reset Bluetooth without any luck.  The audio controls and pairing seemed to work fine, just no audio.  Followed all the tips to reset, unpair/repair and still no audio regardless of audio jack or Bluetooth.  Finally decided to send it back.  Very disappointed as it looked like the prefect match for me, but can't trust the durability.UPDATE:  I'm upping my review to 5 after being contacted by Cambridge Soundworks to replace the defective unit.  I was impressed with how much they care about the user experience and their proactive action to fix any problems.  They sent me a new unit and it's been working great.  No further problems.",5,1,2016-10-29,1,0,0
This speaker is probably the best deal I have ever gotten on Amazon. It's so POWERFUL and  t i n y.  I bought one to go with our projector (which was budget and had terrible onboard speakers) and it easily fills our bedroom with multidimensional sound. It has an aux chord port which was super helpful when we were plugging the Xbox 1 to the projector. It's also better than the onboard speakers on my laptop which is why I want another one.

Cambridge said it would not replace it because warranty was only 30 days. This is the last product I will buy from Cambridge SoundWorks. This speaker was always sitting in the same cool place inside my house and had never been dropped or water damaged. So once again you get what you pay for.Too give Cambridge a fair & good review they finally sent me a replacement for free and a carrying case. Kudos to Cambridge for amending a poor experience. I'll revise once I have had the new speaker for 90 days.,4,1,2016-7-30,1,2,0
"I may have to adjust my review as I use the speaker and see how the battery life and water resistance hold up. Thus far I would say this has done everything and more that I wanted. Sound quality is better than cheap-o blu-tooth speakers, and it is really loud. Like surprisingly loud, you will actually be surprised by how much sound this little thing can crank out. The advertised battery life seems to be accurate, for the first few uses, can't speak to the water resistant part.",5,1,2016-6-3,1,0,0
"I was looking for something that was a bit louder.  I gave this to my son and wound up purchasing a different speaker.  The sound was clear, but not very loud.  I like to listen to my podcasts while I am cooking, but I found that it was not loud enough.",3,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0

It arrived almost fully charged and took about 20 seconds to connect to my phone, Worked great and is plenty loud for casual listening in 90% of circumstances.

"I needed a little auxiliary speaker at my computer station so I could tap and at least hear what I'm recording sometimes (not mixing). The speaker is a nice size and light weight. Pairs easily, sounds OK, actually good for the price, but not nearly as full as my much more expensive JBL and very much more expensive Bose versions. Haven't really tested the battery life but I like that it charges with a standard USB connector.

The sound is very good for this small unit, the speaker is very capable to keep a good pleasant sound when you turn the volume all the way up.  It is worth the price.

It has plenty of volume without the distortions often heard at this price point, and the battery lasts a long time on a charge.

"I bought this product as a replacement for my HMDX jam bluetooth speakers which I have owned for the past couple of years. I bought my HMDX jam for about the same price  as the Oontz Angle 3. I am very satisfied with the Oontz angle 3 considering that it delivers clear sound and for a speaker without a subwoofer, it pretty much delivers as far as my needs are concerned. I basically just use it listening to music in a small room and don't really intend to use it for parties. I did notice that the quality of the music is better when I turned off the equalizer on my iPad mini. The sound is more balanced this way and I tend to like it like that. I like the size and the portability of the product and the added peace of mind knowing that it is also splash proof even though I rarely use it near water. I was satisfied that I was able to pair it with my iPad mini without any issues. I was even surprised that I was able to connect it together with my Amazon bluetooth keyboard. So far I have no issues with both products co functioning on my iPad mini. One technical feature I noticed though is that when I don't keep this unit plugged in for charging and I separate it from my iPad, it turns off by itself. When constantly plugged in though, I didn't have the need to turn it on again once I was in range again. Overall I am very satisfied with this product and I am even planning on buying another one for my desktop computer.",5,1,2015-12-15,1,0,0

Little speaker big sound. I have several bluetooth speakers that I have gifted and the sound is great butttt. ..I didn't like that when a call comes in they can hear me but I can't hear them. You also can hear the caller through the speaker.  My other bluetooth speakers allow me to take calls and I can hear the caller and they can hear me clearly. If you're using this don't pick up calls.  I probably wont buy it again because I do like the feature of using with calls.  Great for tablets tho,4,1,2016-3-21,1,0,0

I read all the great reviews and got excited so I ordered one since I've been looking for a Bluetooth wireless speaker. I put it on charge and it was fully charged within a short time. I guess it was partially charged before it arrived. I turned it on and it connected in a few seconds but there was no sound. I looked at the manual and did all the troubleshooting it directed me to do but still it wouldn't make a sound but the play/pause button was functional so I knew something was wrong. It was definitely defective. I slapped it lightly on the side and the sound came on for 45 seconds and stopped. I would say the 45 seconds of sound that I heard was very quality. I'm disappointed that I was sold a defective product. I'm a very unhappy customer. I called Amazon and they don't even want the product so someone knows what's going on with some of the defective products being sold.,1,1,2017-11-26,1,0,0

Really good as a small speaker and speakerphone.  I've used the Oontz Curve for many years as a computer speaker and speakerphone.  This sounds better.

Great, crisp sound, excellent sound quality and was able to hear it loud and clear even upstairs on the other side of the house.  WOW!

This Bluetooth speaker works so well. It's pretty loud for its size. It was reasonably price compared to other Bluetooth speakers that I have seen. I wish it had a track skipping function but overall it's a good speaker. I use it during my workouts and the beach. It's pretty durable. I've dropped it several times and it still works great. I love that's it's water resistant so I can use it at the pool. I can truly says this speaker isn't a waste of money. Especially at this price.,4,1,2016-5-7,1,0,0
This is no better than using your phone speaker. There is ZERO bass to speak of. Don't waste your money unless you like listening to half of what you're supposed to hear. Started a return after 12 seconds of using. Not worth it.,1,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
I needed a speaker to replace one that was actually much larger than this but has gone out. I had used it in the bathroom and I assume that the moisture finally got the best of it.

this is an edit to my review. I've had the Speaker for 9 months and have literally used it 9 times. It blew out the auxiliary on my IPhone rendering my phone to only being able to use as speaker phone. The speakers volume is broken and will not go above a soft sound.

"I bought this little Oontz Angle 3 speaker to replace a 6 year old Spracht Blue Note that has been durable and trouble free.  I liked the Spracht because it used batteries as well as an ac adaptor and because of the full controls on the top.  What I did not care for was the tinny, clock radio like sound.  Anyway, I was very impressed by the Oontz's easy set up instructions and the nice sound!  For such a small unit, the sound is very clear.  The bass is impressive.  Granted, its not a Bose Sound Link, but still has good clarity and loud enough for a small bedroom.  Not much distortion at high volume.  The fact that it is water reistant is cool.  I cant wait to use this in the shower and listen to my tunes while I scrub clean.  The value of this is a good deal.  It fits in my laptop bag easily.  My only criticism is that for music control, there is only a play/pause button. On the Spracht, I could fast forward and replay a song with the top mounted controls.

FAILED.",1,1,2018-6-15,1,0,0
I LOVE this so much! It works fantastic. I like to listen to music in the shower so I can set a playlist and bring it in and put it on the shelf and not worry that it will get too wet. The battery life lasts very long and it easy to connect your phone to it. I am SO happy I purchased this.,5,1,2018-11-12,1,0,0

"This little speaker is amazing. It really sounds like a much more expensive speaker, and Dare I say it, close to the quality I have heard from a BOSE bluetooth speaker.  The signal does vary a bit occasionally, but I had the speaker about 50 feet away from my phone. Volume is good and distortion is not bad until you try to max out volume about what you would normally use anyway (we like to be able to talk to each other even while music is playing).",4,1,2016-9-20,1,0,0
"I am very satisfied with this amazing product. It puts out a good amount  of sound for a small bluetooth speaker.

Plus the charge lasts much longer on this one as well.",5,1,2017-8-7,1,0,0
"This is a powerful bluetooth speaker that far exceeds the terrible speakers on the laptop. For the price it is a screaming bargain. For its size the sound is impressive. I tested the same song played on both my Bose Sound Link and the Oontz and have to say the Bose is far superior, but cost $179.00. Therefore the Oontz will be a welcome addition to my music players. I have not tested the speakerphone yet. Again I expect the sound will be far superior to the cell phone. Buy this now on Amazon and use the coupon, you will be very pleased.",4,1,2018-5-26,1,1,0
"Like this a lot! Good sound quality!!Side note: don’t forget to adjust the volume on your phone/music player (and not just the speaker’s volume) prior to pairing.

"This thing sounds better than some of the $100 bluetooth speakers I've seen and heard. For $20 this thing is amazing. And its considered rugged, so its sealed and is dirt and water resistant. I wouldn't dunk it in a pool or anything but you could definitely bring it next to the pool or the beach without worrying about it. One of the better purchases I've made recently. I highly recommend this speaker. I wish it acted at a charger for your phone as some speakers do, but for $20 I can live without that feature.",5,1,2015-12-3,1,0,0
"EDIT 3/13/2017: Cambridge Soundworks sent me a replacement speaker after I posted the review below.  The new speaker has worked much better than the last, and I received a carrying case for my troubles.  I still do not suggest keeping this speaker where it will get hit by large splashes or direct streams of water.Original Review: Not good in the shower unless completely away from contact with water.  I had it on my shower rack under the shower head, and just from getting splashed the sound would become muffled and poor quality, and after just over a month of use in the shower it won't charge.  I never fully submerged it, it just got splashed from time to time..",4,1,2017-2-3,1,0,0

My husband and I adore this speaker. When we used it for the first time we were shocked with not only the sound output but the clarity this little speaker had. It easily rivaled our blue tooth TV speakers in both categories (we have good TV blutooth speakers btw).We have used this on long trips with our daughters tablet and it's stood up very very well.

"I like this little speaker. I had a jambox for 3 years and was spoiled by the loud robust sound it gave out but when it died last year I did not want to spend hundreds on a replacement. I bought the oontz angle 3 because it was inexpensive and ""waterproof"". It is nice to have music around the house again and although it is nowhere near as loud as the jambox was, it's an awesome little speaker and if you sit it in the corner of your room it fills the house with great sound. We've had many dance parties with this speaker, it's definitely worth the money.",4,1,2015-12-3,1,0,0
"For the price, function is perfect.  Sounds rich, maybe a bit bass heavy. Maybe fixable with an equalizer app?

It sounded good and was well made especially for the money.Bad news:  shortly after using it several times sound starts to cut out for no apparent reason, it sounds similar to a skipping record.  I considered that it could be my phone, but several other people I work with tried and the same issue happened.  It also doesn’t matter it it’s on battery power or plugged in.

"I was thrilled to get my first Angle 3 bluetooth speaker for the Daily Special price, having foresworn all portable wired speakers whose wires inevitably fail. I unpacked it and it paired immediately with my iPad w/o issues, the sound was great and I spent an enjoyable 1/2 hour listening to my audio book. Then I turned the book off to go back work and when I turned the speaker back on - bupkiss. No amount of charging brought the thing back to life. I felt like I'd been had. However I wrote to the company and explained the problem and even though it was the weekend, I got a rapid reply with offers of assistance and suggestions and apologies. When further charging did not work, I was told to send it back and that another speaker was already on the way, with a free cover. They could not have been more accommodating and responsive. When my first speaker failed, I had paused an order for two more speakers intended as gifts, and Cambridge offered to send them to me at the Special price, even though that offer was over. I would not hesitate to do further business with this company on the strength of the product quality - my new speaker works beautifully - and on the uncommon responsiveness and civility of its staff and customer care policies.",5,1,2015-11-20,1,0,0

"I have been messing with this this for almost three months and it still impresses me. They don't lie about the battery life on it. It last a very long time. I have left it playing form morning to dusk never putting back on the charger. So if you just charge it every two or three days you should never have to worry about going out on you. It also spruced me how much load this little thing can get. It can be heard though out simi-silent house. As far user friendlyness goes it has power, volume, and pause buttons. The volume settings on the speaker are separate from the volume setting on the music player your using. Which mite get annoying. Just max out one of the settings and use the other for full control. I really would have liked it to have a skip button so I don't need my phone at all to use it, but that the only thing that I think it falls at as user friendlyness  goes.  This thing has a lot of holes on the bottom of it and WILL short out if you dunk it in water, but if put it on it right side the speaker hole are very small and would easly let water in so it's OK to shower with it, just use some sense when doing it and it should be fine. Lastly, the build quality seem sold. It has rubber boring each side of the rages and a bit of a rubberized stand at the base so it should stay where you put it. The plastic is sold and thick so it should be able to take a drop (I did not find out for my self if it could or not).  All in all it is a pretty nice thing to have if you in the market for one. You just can't use it to skip to the next track.",5,1,2016-4-25,1,0,0

The one thing that keeps me from giving it 4 or 5 stars is the lack of music control.  The only thing the controls do is connect to blue tooth, pause a song, and raise and lower the volume.  There's no song advance like most of the alternatives.",3,1,2016-10-16,1,0,0
Hooks right up and still going strong after about a year of use. Long life on the battery too ! Can't go wrong with this one. Highly recommended!,5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"I've been using this to replace my desktop speakers to clean all the cord clutter, but I'm not sure yet if it was worth it. The fact that the OontZ isn't ready  to go as soon as my computer is is pretty annoying. I have to reconnect it every time I turn it on, and sometimes it doesnt work so i have to restart my pc and try again. I think it's supposed to automatically connect to where it was last paired as soon as you turn it on, as long as it's in range, but mine has to be manually paired every single time. It's a huge pain in the butt. I also wish there was a knob for turning volume up and down instead of buttons. It's just kind of a hassle having to pick the thing up every time just to locate the + and - buttons. It's all black so you cant just instinctively know, reach over and change it. Just while writing this review, I switched it from 3 to 2 stars because I'm just thinking about this stuff that makes this unit more inconvenient and annoying! The cords it comes with are way too short, so if I want to use the aux cord instead of bluetooth (counterproductive to why I bought this in the first place) I have to keep it right on the edge of the desk, and really the only way to listen to this as a desktop speaker is straight in front, since you don't get a left and right distinction. It's a great price, but if you're replacing perfectly good speakers just to go cordless, expect to find some frustration with the change.",2,1,2017-1-21,1,4,0
"Purchased based on price and solidly positive reviews, the speaker arrived quickly. Upon fist use however, thaw audio book I played caused the sound drop out after every pause in the reading, resulting in the first few syllables to be cut out.I emailed service on a Sunday. They replied in minutes confirming the issue was known, and that firmware update from their engineers would fix the issue.",5,1,2016-4-23,1,0,0
"When I first got this and connected it, the speaker sounded really good and clear with everything. Unfortunately, after a couple weeks of use, it's gotten choppy/fuzzy at times. It still seems to do alright for the most part with music, but I can't hear calls very well. Not sure if it's the speaker itself or the Bluetooth connection. Maybe I just got a lemon? Still have time to return it, so I might end up doing that.",3,1,2017-1-18,1,0,0

"Very impressive for the cost. Yes you can purchase a $300 BT speaker that sounds great. If you are like myself and only need it to make your laptop or tablet put out more sound , this speaker fits the bill for me . Bluetooth connects very quickly and easily.

Both sound very good considering the price and built well too IMO.",5,1,2016-5-19,1,0,0

"First one I received worked correctly for one day.  After posting a review stating that, the folks at Oontz contacted me to apologize, and quickly sent me a replacement. The replacement device has worked prefectly. This little box pumps out significant sound for its size. The bass response is surprisingly good and the highs aren't blown out. The device is lightweight but feels solid in your hand. The water resistant construction makes it perfect to use in the bathroom for a relaxing bath or shower. I use it most when grilling outside, or tailgating with a small group. I'm sure there are better speakers out there at this size, but you will find no better value for your dollar at under $30.",3,1,2016-4-24,1,0,0

I had better sound quality straight from my phone which sucks as well. I'm not sure if it's a ""you get what you pay for"" scenario or you can actually get a bluetooth portable speaker with good sound at a reasonable price and the OontZ Angle 3 just sucks.

"For such a small item, this speaker is amazingly loud.  If you want volume, this one packs a wallop.  My car stereo doesn't have Bluetooth, so I bought this to listen to tunes in my car from my phone.  I love the shape, too, as it fits perfects at the juncture of my windshield and console.  The downside is that its range is a little limited.  Music purists who want a broad spectrum of sound may be a little disappointed.  Still, the bass is hefty and the treble is loud, so this speaker is perfect for portable sound that you want to share with a group.",4,1,2016-1-28,1,0,0

"For its size and price the sound is good, but don't expect booming bass sounds from these tiny speakers.  It's an unfair comparison given the price gap, but the difference in sound quality between the OontZ and my old Bose Sound Dock is remarkable.  The bigger issue is the poor microphone and sound quality when used as a speaker-phone, which was my intended use.  On a value-for-money basis as a Bluetooth music speaker only I might have given it four stars but the speaker-phone quality drops another star.",3,1,2015-11-23,1,0,0

I was honestly hoping for a similar sound signature but from a smaller and less powerful package as is expected of a small Bluetooth speaker.  A good example of this is the JBL Flip 3, which I replaced the Oontz with, and it can easily fill a room.The Bluetooth performance is also underwhelming.

I've ran this thing for well over 8 hours straight with no problems.,5,1,2017-8-5,1,0,0
Have been using this Bluetooth speaker from past 1 month and I would say that it justifies the top ratings it received from the other customers.It has awesome loud sound and great bass. It is also rugged and splach resistant but have not tried the splash part personally. Even though it has bluetooth 3.0 it has good connectivity and I did not have any connectivity issues.,5,1,2016-8-13,1,0,0
I love this speaker! It's so very interesting and it tells me all kinds of stories! It drowns out the voices quite nicely too. I highly recommend!,5,1,2019-3-11,1,1,0
"I purchased this speaker for use around my pool area and could not have been more pleased.  It is very compact and the sound even at top volume is not distorted in any what whatsoever. We were a bit leary when I got it as it is so small -- boy what a surprise.  We take it out to the pool for the day 6 hours or so and its still tickin' -- charge it for a few hours and we're ready to run again. Due to the shape of this speaker, you can either put it on its end or lay it down.",5,1,2016-7-12,1,0,0
Used it several times after it arrived. Now after 45 days. Does not connect. Does not charge. Does not turn on. Does not play when plugged into power. Even with connection to the headphone jack instead of Bluetooth. Worst purchase ever on Amazon.,1,1,2019-3-5,1,1,0

I purchased these for my sister and she loved it for the time she used it. Since then she's moved on to other speakers but she still keeps this one around and tells me it still works but compared to the others it's not as good.,4,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"Extremely impressive sound spectrum in such a small package - 5 stars. Over the years, my speakers of choice have been standard 4-way large expensive floor speakers. I was skepticle that quality sound could come from such a small cabinet, but I was very intrigued after listening to bluetooth models my friends have. Several years ago, I impulssively purchased my first bluetooth speaker, the mini jambox; what a disappointment! Not as loud as expected and the base response was pittiful. I needed a small portable bluetooth speaker that would fit in my carry on luggage as well as listen to mp3 books. Excellent packaging. Decided to first test these with my Mp3 player using the included 3.5mm cable, very nice that a jack is included on the speaker for this. In order to see if this speaker really could generate base according to other reviews, decided to try some hard rock, (metalicca etc.) and was very surprised that even when turning up the volume, little distortion occurred. Tried some melodic rock (Rush), and again was very supprised at the quality of vocals, the instruments (synthesizer), in the mid and higher ranges. And the 10-watts from this speaker is much louder and so much clearer than the mini jambox or other sub $100 speakers I've tested at Best Buy. Streaming using my Iphone 5s also worked very well. This speaker is great for a small listening area/room, and the speaker is definitely loud enough with the shower on full. I would never have believed such good sound could come from only a 5-inch long triangular speaker; listening is believing! And for listening to audio books, the fidelity is great. I'm going to purchase the larger Xl model to use in my garage to enjoy the rock while doing wood working.",5,1,2016-1-26,1,0,0

"I bought mine Dec 3, 2016 and it’s still kicking just as good in August 2019. It gets used almost daily.

I’ve had the Beats Pill (twice) which gave me  nothing but problems and they cost 3-4x the cost of this one and don’t sound as good as this one. I’d buy 2 more whenever this one gives up the ghost.",5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"I have had a total 3 oontz speakers. The longevity for each was about 6 months. After the first one quit working, I bought another hoping it was a fluke.

I even put it's water resistance to the test and took it in the shower. My shelf is behind my shower head so it was pretty consistently dripped on and it still worked and sounded excellent. I'll never have to take another boring shower.",5,1,2017-4-22,1,0,0
"Bought this after reading a lot of reviews, just like to have it to listen to music while in the shower and while getting ready. Had no problem connecting to my android via Bluetooth.

Update: after a year-and-a-half of owning, it won't connect to Bluetooth anymore.",3,1,2017-5-22,1,0,0
"Not half bad. I quickly found that if you place it on the wrong side, it sounds tiny and just horrible.  The bass vent is the bottom. The speakers can face you, but I prefer to place it backwards and let them bounce the sound off the wall. Just sounds a little more acoustic that way. Nice and loud for its size, though I want something bigger and higher quality for the back yard",4,1,2017-6-21,1,0,0
"I use this for my class when we do dances, and exercise. I can put this several feet away, and you can still hear a very clearly. Connectivity is a little iffy sometimes, but I don't know if that's just mine. Not a huge deal, still use it all the time.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

Music is also easy to hear, Pandora has experienced a resurgence!",5,1,2017-1-2,1,1,0
"This little bluetooth speaker is amazing! I just got it today and in literally 5 minutes I had it paired with my computer and was practically blown out of the room with the sound that blasted out of it. I've bought more expensive portable speakers and some have had more features, but they've been bulkier or the volume level is too low or they've had functions that I don't use and that just clutter up the device. This little thing is perfect for my needs--fits easily in my hand or a cupholder in the car, clearly marked controls, AUX in jack, standard micro USB charging port, and most importantly--the sound! I can't believe the volume I can get out of this, and with very little distortion. It seems to be sturdy and has a nice rubberized casing. There are light indicators to let you know when it's charging and when the charge is complete. Apparently it's water resistant, too. It comes with very short AUX and micro USB cables, so I'll probably substitute longer, sturdier ones, but honestly, for under $30 I have never found a better speaker. The retail price is listed as around $100, so this is a total bargain. If you're looking for something like this, you can't do better.",5,1,2016-3-16,1,0,0

"This is a beast of a Bluetooth speaker! Cambridge did it right when they developed this speaker. The sound is fantastic on every volume setting and it is as clear as can be. Honestly, I've bought 4 other speakers ranging from $30-$75, and None of them even come close to the power or quality of sound that the Oontz Angle 3 delivers!

I was a little skeptical about buying this speaker. Reviews looked really good so I figured for 25 bucks I'll do it. When I received the speaker it was a lot smaller than I had thought but...

I've seen reviews saying it was too loud, but I haven't had that problem at all. The size is perfect and the shape looks cool and makes it easy to lay flat or stand on end. Very happy with my new Oontz 3.",5,1,2017-1-8,1,1,0
"This speaker has great, big sound.  It sounds wonderful, has a built in rechargable battery, and sleek to boot.But, be aware, that when you first pair it with your device, and a message pops up telling you to reboot your device, you really do need to do so.  Until you do, the speaker will be almost impossible to re-pair with your device, after it loses connection to the device.  Once you reboot it however, it takes 2-3 seconds to re-pair with your device.",5,1,2016-11-16,1,0,0

"So far I’m very satisfied with it; I needed something to stream my music stations and not be limited to listening to all my tunes in my bedroom where I had my old falling apart stereo system with a crap load of wires collecting dust balls. I’m able to leave my phone in the bedroom where I’m streaming my music and bring the Oontz with me to the kitchen while I’m cooking or even leaving it on the sink while I’m taking a shower. It’s great if you want to watch a movie on your tablet and have some decent audio apart from your tablet’s speakers.The only thing (and it’s very minor) is the charger. The mini USB charger has a very short cord (probably the length of a pencil)  and you’ll need something to connect the USB on the other end in order to give it some juice once the battery runs dry. So far it’s been good battery wise. For the price, I’d definitely recommend this.",5,1,2016-2-16,1,2,0

Wow! I am blown away by this little stereo - the sound is amazing and it gets so much louder than I was expecting! The stereo in my car is broken and this completely makes up for it (I drive a big Chevy Tahoe and the sound fills the whole truck!). 5 + stars!!!,5,1,2018-11-3,1,0,0

Great little bluetooth speaker that comes with min-usb cord (only about 3 inches long) and auxiliary cord. The bass on this thing is crazy! So many uses - I bought it for using with my phone but I ended up hooking it up to my laptop at school. It works as a speaker for my whole classroom to watch videos on the projector. Very small and convenient.,5,1,2017-1-15,1,1,0
"I bought this for music and was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much from a little speaker, but the description saidmore bass and I heard none. If music amplification is your focus, this is not the speaker for you.",2,1,2018-2-24,1,1,0
"Great sound! I bought this so I can listen to music in the shower. I wasn't excepting too much for the size and price but I was more than surprised. The sound is amazing, loud and very clear for such a small unit. Perfect size. I even find myself bringing it all over the house and using it instead of our speaker system in the living room. The Bluetooth range is great and it's very easy to switch back and forth from multiple devices. Also I am looking forward to using it outside by the pool this summer. I am very happy with the Oontz Angle 3 and would definitely recommend to anyone!",5,1,2016-1-19,1,0,0

"This speaker gets quite loud, for how small it is. I have never had to turn it all the way up, so it's plenty loud. The sound quality is quite good, although I am not a great judge.

It holds a charge very well, I've had it around 6 months, and it still charges quickly and holds a charge well.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0

"It will not play anything despite the blue light indicating that it is paired.

"Definitely get what you pay for, not a great speaker but good for one you don't have to get a second mortgage for.

"Being a musician, I can attest that this device truly delivered.  The clarity is superb, and the handling of low tone sounds really amazed me.

I totally recommend this product; you won’t be disappointed.",5,1,2017-3-30,1,1,0
Just received it and tried it out right away. A little smaller than I expected but looks to be made well. Tones are crisp and clear. Could use a little more base but sounds fine as it is.The whole thing is jet black so its difficult to see the operating buttons. I am using it outdoors poolside so it will be tested. Hope it holds up. For the Prime Day discounted price it has been well worth it.,4,1,2017-7-16,1,0,0
"It is much smaller than I expected. I was under the impression that it was going to be a larger speaker, but I was pleased with the quality of sound. For being a small speaker it puts out a lot of sound! I like the buttons on the side to control the volume also. I wish there was a “skip” button to move to the next song etc so you don’t have to use the device it’s connected to.",4,1,2017-12-8,1,0,0
"Pretty good sound for its size which was way smaller than I expected even though it was listed in some reviews. I wouldn't say its big enough for a party but as background music is perfect. I was tempted to return and get the big one for boating, maybe next spring.",5,1,2018-10-5,1,0,0

Also worked well for back deck BBQ, toddler birthday party, and just relaxing with some jazz after yardwork.  YES it has remarkable bass for its size.  How it is positioned regulates the bass.  May end up buying a 2nd one.",5,1,2017-3-7,1,0,0
This little speaker packs a surprising punch! It gets a lot louder than you would think from such a little thing. Also has a long range for staying bluetooth connected to phones and a really REALLY long battery life. We've been using it since Christmas and it still hasn't needed charging (today is 1/15). The blue tooth connects with both android and iphone,5,1,2017-1-15,1,1,0
"This was a gift for my 15 yo.  There are a dizzying amount of choices for bluetooth speakers.  This wasn't the one she was looking at, but she is very happy with it.  She likes the sound, the ease of use, and she likes the angled look more than the cube she thought she wanted.",5,1,2019-7-6,1,0,0
"This speaker is awesome. I use it in my kitchen when I am cooking and I also use it in my husbands truck. I have to make sure the volume is in the middle when I first connect to my blue tooth because it can be really sharp and loud. The speaker is great for picnics or a day on the beach. I would for sure purchase this product again and I highly recommend it. Oh and the battery lasts a pretty decent amount of time, I haven't actually timed it but it last long enough that I don't get pissed when it dies.",5,1,2017-12-21,1,0,0
"Sounds great!  I tried others, but this is really a nice quality product with good frequency response at a very good price.  Would definitely recommend to others.

This is a great little Bluetooth speaker with quality sound in a compact form.  I bought as part of a Amazon Echo Dot Christmas gift for better sound for my aging parents.  They can move it anywhere as it takes up hardly any space.  The only complaint would be that all controls and charging port cover are black  (same color as speaker) which can make it challenging for aging eyes to see.,4,1,2016-12-26,1,1,0

This little speaker is amazing!!!  I boight one for myself when it popped up as a Daily Deal.  The ratings others had given it inspired me to make the purchase.  Some raters stated that it isnt loud enough but I disagree.  I just used it outside all weekend while doing numerous projects and I had no problem hearing it through the drill and hammering.  When my wife first heard it she had to have one also for her office.  The battery life is excellent.  I have had mine a week now and have used it everyday for about 6-8 hours and havent recharged it yet.  I highly recommend this speaker especially at the $25-$30 range at which I got both of ours.,5,1,2016-4-18,1,0,0
Don't let the size fool you.  This is one little powerful speaker!  It replaces an outside stereo box which is huge and probably more suited for a construction job site.  Actually this one could replace it too!  Love it.  I turn on my jets to the hot tub place it on the ledge away from the water (fits nicely on that ledge) and play the tunes.  The Bluetooth links up so easily.  Very impressed.  If you are on the fence try it!  You will love it!,5,1,2016-7-15,1,0,0
My car radio died and the dealer wanted $700 to replace it.  I listen to music almost entirely from my phone.  Bought this and was quite pleasantly surprised as the sound quality & volume in my car.

We've had this for a couple of months and really enjoy it. We have some expensive music players but we end up using this speaker instead. Music sounds great. And you can't beat the price. We take it camping and to the beach. Everyone in our family that has seen and heard it has bought one.Only con is that when the Bluetooth is on your device has to be fairly close to the speaker. But I don't know if that's the speaker or just bad connection.,4,1,2016-6-14,1,0,0

I bought this because my previous speakers had a tinny quality and weren't very loud. The reviews all pointed to this being a great purchase and it was fine at first but after a couple of months of very minimal use I noticed the battery didn't hold up as well as before and it had an even tinnier quality than the set I had replaced with this one.

"I've had this speaker for about a month now. I use it where I work. It is never full volume so I can hear customers, but the quality is excellent. I bought a similar priced speaker from FYE last year, but had major issues with it from charging, to durability (literally fell apart after putting it back in the box for safe-keeping), to volume. This speaker is 10x better AND doesn't break the bank.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0

The Bluetooth connection has static almost is i was listening to a cd that is skipping. The battery seem about right for the price I guess. The sound quality is inconsistent some time it’s loader than other with the same song. I have to disconnect and reconnect for it to be loud again. I could be louder overall.,1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
I ordered two of these. Was only going to open one and test it out in case I wasn’t happy. But OH MY GOD! This little guy kicks out the music!

"This little speaker is excellent for the money. It’s of course limited by what it is, but at this price range it’s top of its field for me. Loud enough to be heard from a dock while swimming in the lake. Loud enough to put in the kitchen and clean the house. It’s a great little budget speaker!",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

I don’t usually leave reviews. I do the aerial silks so I need to hear the music 20 feet in the air. The girls were like “oh you should’ve let us know to bring our beats speaker” well when this little thing started playing we were all surprised at how loud it was without distortion. It connects easily to my phone and Alexa. It beats paying $70 plus dollars for a UBL. I’m very happy to take this on a kayak and use it for sports stuff.,5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0

When it arrived from Amazon it was in a larger box.  I did not open if for a couple of days and when I did I was worried because the box that it was actually in was rather small and the speaker itself is smaller than I expected.

"I like the product.  It is a bit larger than most portable BT speakers, but that is probably to support better speakers.

Left my phone plugged in, in the kitchen and took the speaker back to the bedrooms without any problem.  At least 20 feet away and with walls in the way.  Only minor problem was that it wouldn't sync with my phone but I unpaired it and the repaired it and it works great now.",4,1,2017-2-12,1,0,0
"Great value for the money. I've owned several bluetooth speakers, and none of the cheap ones are going to give you an outstanding, high-fidelity listening experience. Frankly, I suspect that few of the expensive ones will either.This speaker sounds good (not great), puts out enough bass for my ears, and is loud enough to fill a bedroom, bathroom, or garage.

I was amazed when I listened to the OontZ Angle 3 for the first time.  I could not believe the sound that this little speaker cranks out.  I use my S7's Google Play Music app and the sound is crisp and clear with very good base considering its size.

I was very suprised at the sound that this little thing can put out. Originally purchased to take on the boat to play music at low levels instead of the HD stereo on the boat.

I have not tested the exact amount of time one charge lasts, but I am pretty sure it is at least 4 hours.  I am very happy with these and highly recommend them!",5,1,2016-9-7,1,0,0
"I did some research online prior to buying this speaker. I bought one for my son and one for my daughter.  It has great sound, good bass, and if you place it on a surface without vibration issues, the sound is crisp and clear.  this speaker also gets pretty loud and keeps its sound quality throughout the volume range.  It also pairs with iphones quickly and easily, and once paired it stays paired (in my experience). I don't think you could get better quality and sound for the price.",5,1,2015-12-19,1,0,0

"I haven't tested the water resistance of it but the sound quality is pretty good for such a small package. I haven't yet maxed it out but it seems like it can get pretty loud. Battery duration seems to be fairly good, I haven't run out of battery yet. Paired up with my iPhone just fine.The only complaint that I have is that the plastic cover over the charging port is hard to get open.

I have tested both the bluetooth capabilities and the jack, both with phones and tablets, and the quality is the same either way: excellent.

"Great little speaker! Compact and fairly sturdy. Sound quality is decent given it's price. I find the bass is easily distorted if you have the volume up too high on the unit. I find if I tweak the volume on the device the music is playing from, it helps more than trying to lower the volume on the speaker unit. But overall, for the price, I really can't complain.

"I love this speaker. I go backpacking alot and in the PNW, we get quite a bit of precipitation. I have used this numerous times outside while setting up camp in the rain and it works great. Also has a port for older devices that may not have bluetooth (like original iPods and such) which is fantastic.

Yes, but, when I compare it to my Solo, I find the bass lacking.  So, it's really about personal preference.  If you prefer high treble with limited bass, get the 3, but if you like a lot of bass with a fair amout of treble, get the smaller Solo at a better price.",3,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0

They're matte black on matte black, and as the unit itself looks the same on each side it was a little cumbersome at first flipping it around looking for the power/volume controls. Volume buttons are raised with + and - so I've got those down but the power button is in my opinion in a weird, pain in the butt spot, barely perceptible except that I know it is directly above the AUX chord.",5,1,2016-5-17,1,0,0

I usually keep the speaker one or two from the loudest it goes. The sound is good for this kind of speaker and the battery has a decent life. Its pretty simple and straightforward to use.",5,1,2018-4-20,1,0,0

Even on Bluetooth there can be some crackling/poor quality sounds if the phone's display is on. There was also interference when the Bluetooth was on and I set this close to the baby monitor. For the most part, though, this seems like a good quality little speaker.",4,1,2015-12-19,1,0,0
"I love this speaker.  I can't believe the quality of sound that comes from this tiny speaker.  It charges quickly - it stays charged for a long time.  It has fallen on the floor a couple of times because it vibrates slightly with bass and I've had it too close to the edge of a counter, but that's the only issue.  It seems super durable and portable.  It also connects to blue tooth faster than any other blue tooth device we have in the house.  It's awesome.",5,1,2017-11-13,1,0,0
"This is an AWESOME little speaker. The bluetooth connects incredibly easily and quickyl. The sound quality is also very good. I live in a relatively small apartment but I can leave it on the living room table at about medium volume and here it from anywhere. It's smaller than I expected - which is awesome. I also love that you can take calls on the speaker. I was incredulous of how well that would work, but its actually very easy and very clear. I would DEFINITELY recommend this if you're looking for a solid, affordable little speaker you can take anywhere.",5,1,2017-4-21,1,0,0
"I've owned one of these in the past, and absolutely love it.  I only gave this review a 4, because the unit I received was used (ordered new), and DOA (wouldn't even take a charge).  The return process is not as friendly as I would like.  Since I lack packing tape, I have to make a trip to the shipping store to get the box re-sealed.  It would have been nice if I could receive the replacement and send back the defective unit in the same package.  That's really my only gripe.  Sound wise, I had a previous generation of this speaker and it was excellent.",4,1,2017-3-13,1,0,0

"I didn't have high expectations for this speaker. It's a great speaker if you're streaming movies on your devices and it will last up to 48 hours after charging it completely. My only hang up was the USB. The part that fits into the USB slot is fine but the part that connects to the speaker broke after 2 weeks. I don't know how as I never dropped the speaker with USB connected, never tugged on the cord, and I was always cautious when disconnecting. It still works but it's a hassle to check on it every now and then to make sure it doesn't disconnect.

I saw that this speaker was on sale for $29.99 and decided that I need to add it to my collection. It was smaller than I had anticipated(because I didn't look at the description) but it is pretty loud. At the loudest volume the bass doesn't get distorted like some of the other speakers I have.

"The sound is awesome for such a small speaker. It's not going to rattle a room, but I use in a locker room, as well as outdoors for cookouts, and it easily fills the area with music that actually has some bass.

"This Cambridge Oontz angle 3 is simply an awful sounding bluetooth speaker.  The bottom line is that regardless of price, this speaker sounds terrible and isn't even really an upgrade from most built in phone speakers.  The sound is tinny, screechy, with no audible bass or midbass to speak of.  Literally hard to stand listening to for more than a few minutes, the sound is that bad.  It vibrates on the surface you put it on, but unless you're six inches away, you won't hear a lick of bass out of this thing.  After getting suckered into buying this cheapo speaker, I don't understand why people think this sounds good and worse yet, why they think for $25 you'll get a speaker worth listening to.  You simply will not, and I fell victim to this as well.  I returned this speaker after a couple of weeks of my ears suffering.  Life is too short to listen to crappy speakers like this.  Do yourself, your ears, and those around you a favor and spend more to get a solid sounding speaker.  Personally, I think around $100 is the minimum I'll spend to get a good sounding bluetooth speaker, anything less and you'll mostly get junk or refurbed units.  Some good sounding bluetooth speakers actually worth listening to for around $100 include: Klipsch KMC1, Klipsch Gig, Klipsch Groove, Bose Soundlink Color, JBL Charge. JBL UE roll, JBL clip.  Many of these speakers are open box or refurb for under $100, but still blow the pants off this Oontz speaker.  The only speaker I have found listenable under $30 is the Philips Shoqbox mini, and even that is barely tollerable to me, but much better than this Cambridge speaker.",1,1,2016-8-12,1,4,0

"I had the Anker Soundcore 2 and was using it with my Echo Dot. The problem was the Anker kept going to sleep after not being used for a while and I had to manually turn it on and pair it with the Dot if I wanted to use it after a period of inactivity. Obviously this was unacceptable and defeated the whole hands-free thing. So I returned the Anker, did some research and this brings me to the Oontz. The Oontz is small, does not go to sleep when connected to the Dot, and sounds fairly good. I don't think it's as crystal clear as the Anker Soundcore 2 but to me the Oontz has a warmer tone with slightly better bass and costs less than the Soundcore 2 (I realize sound quality is subjective). Oontz seems to focus more on highs and mids, but that is to be expected in a speaker of this size. I mostly listen to classic rock and classical music, for this purpose the Oontz performs admirably. It's not going to blow your socks off, but it sounds like a bigger speaker then it actually is. I did not have any problem pairing to the Dot and it was up and running in a matter of minutes. It's loud enough to fill a decent size room and can even be heard on the other side of the house. I recommend the Oontz with no reservations.UPDATE 01/02/19",5,1,2018-1-7,1,3,0

Very loud and long lasting charge. I use these types of portable speakers at work as I'm usually the only one there and the sounds from these is very nice and super loud. I'm usually able to get about 4-5 hours of continuous play with heavy bass and treble. Not too bad considering the one i bought previous was an amazon brand one and only lasted about 2 hours max and took forever to charge. Worth the money.,5,1,2016-12-12,1,0,0

Very good sound for half the price.I haven't tried it in the shower, and probably never will, but it's nice to know it is water resistant if I'm using outdoors and it starts to rain.",5,1,2015-12-10,1,0,0
"I love the sound quality of this speaker, especially at the price! I trust this brand implicitly which certainly helped in aiding my confidence to buy. I've had other speaker products from Cambridge SoudWorks in the past. I particularly like the size, the durability and sound quality. It says its waterproof and it survived a trip to the beach where it was exposed to water and sand. It was submerged or anything nor do I think it's intended to be. The elements didn't affect anything. The bluetooth connected quickly and easily with my iPhone and the battery lasted the whole 3 hours I was at the beach. Great product that I would highly recommend. Only con is I wish the charging cable was longer.",5,1,2016-7-26,1,1,0
"I really like, almost love, but really do like this.  My first bluetooth speaker so take this with a grain of salt.  It sounds incredibly good on conference calls - Iike its voice sound way better than my amazon basics ubs computer speakers.  And for streaming music while I'm outside doing projects, etc its great, but not awesome, but surprisingly good.  Seems like very good value for the money - Id buy it again fer sure.",5,1,2016-10-5,1,0,0
"Awesome speakers.  Bought 6 of these for the Christmas holiday.  Was a bit hesitant, but wow!  These speakers are on par with the JBL. My kids love them too.  They walk around with them blasting while hooked up to their phones.  They are loud too so I often have to ask them to turn it down.  The sound quality is really great.  I would certainly buy them again, and have bought them again for my wife's niece and nephew.  By way of full disclosure, I am NOT getting paid for doing this review nor did i get the speakers for free.  I just wanted to leave the seller positive feed back because they deserve it.  Happy New Years.",5,1,2016-1-7,1,0,0
this little guy is AMAZING! easily connected. great sound. small enough to just have sitting on the table for a get together. love love love!!!! I was skeptical because it was so cheap but really this is all we need for a small backyard,5,1,2019-4-17,1,0,1
Excellent speaker for the money.  Will easily connect and reconnect if you walk out of distance.  Not as loud as my Bose but not as expensive.  Would say it holds it's weight for the amount spent.  I now own three for separated places and have enjoyed them All.,5,1,2018-9-2,1,0,0

"This speaker is really great for at-home listening (office, kitchen, bedroom, etc.) when there aren't competing natural sounds. Outside, it's pretty quiet. After months of enjoying it in my home office, I tried to use it in the dugout pre-game at my kids' baseball game. Couldn't hear it really at all from not too far away. Probably wouldn't be a problem if it's on a towel right next to you at the beach, but don't expect much range outdoors.",4,1,2017-3-9,1,0,0
"I bought this because a previous Oontz Angle worked amazingly for a long time. This one had slightly better sound but only worked for two months. Now it'll connect and play for about two minutes. Then it sounds like a skipping CD for a few seconds before it stops playing entirely. I've tried charging it, resetting it, etc. Nothing makes a difference, and now the return window is closed. I won't be buying one again.",1,1,2016-9-27,1,0,0
When I first got this speaker I really enjoyed it but than I started seeing flaws I notice if I'm a couple of feet away or around the corner the music will start breaking up even when I been down with the phone in my hand it breaks up as well... Sound is still good I just prefer a speaker with better range because this speaker is not that at all,2,1,2018-1-14,1,0,1
"Great product, decent sound and awesome volume for those size speakers. I enjoy the bluetooth capability and the fact that it rings when your phone does but goes silent when you take the call. Great range for the bluetooth also. Only problem is it sounds like woofers in a Honda Civic when it's really loud and it's missing some mid range but not much. If you really pump the volume you get some shaky sounds. This is to be expected and perhaps forgiven for such a great volume out of such a little box. I can only imagine how loud the bigger Oontzs get.  I don't ever need it this loud because I use at work. This device is perfect for work if you keep your phone within 20 feet or so.",4,1,2017-2-8,1,0,0

ONLY thing that would make it better is if you could switch the songs with a button on the speaker, 1st world problems. lol",5,1,2016-7-16,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker because of the price to see if a bluetooth speaker would work with my smart device and not risk a lot of money. If worked I would buy a more expensive system.  It worked so well, I forgot buying the more expensive system.

It comes with a USB cord and also the 3.5mm aux cord included. For this price you can’t beat its quality, that’s why I gave it 5 stars. Makes a great inexpensive gift too!",5,1,2018-8-5,1,0,0

For such a small device and internal speakers it produces clear quality sound with base.  I recommend putting on the floor under a coffee table when playing a movie pointing it outward.  You'll feel the base and overall better sound than when  you put it on a table. speakers were made to be put on a floor.  If I had a complaint it would be in truth more of a desire...that they packed 2 more speakers on the reverse side for the potential for true stereo sound... they would need to double its length but given the darn this is only about 6 inches or so...another 6 wouldn't bother me. great job on the product.

I've heard cell phone speakers that sound almost as good, and have a pair of BT earbuds that blow it away.  I wanted to like this speaker but found it to so be annoying that I returned it.  That being said, I don't believe this is an inferior product.  I think I was expecting too much from a speaker this size based on the reviews.

I use this a lot out by the pool and the last thing I want to do is to keep getting in and out to reset the bluetooth.

Perfection would be tweaking it on the high just a bit. Having said that, for the money, it's an excellent value. And if we can't have it all it's a good solution. Tweak the highs just a bit and it goes to a 5 star.",4,1,2016-1-4,1,0,0

"I bought this for my wife. She had asked if she could use my old Bose system out in the barn....nope. So she choose this speaker instead. Awsome! I'm not really a tec junkie, but was really impressed. Pretty load, music is clear.. for what it was and the price considered, heck it a great speaker.Connects to any Bluetooth devise, she mostly uses it for her iPhone.",5,1,2017-3-26,1,0,0
"Sound and volume are even better than I expected!  It really suits my needs with regards to portability and budget.  I have been primarily using the aux cable to directly connect my iPod touch 3rd generation (only used for music now) and occasionally Bluetooth to connect to my iPhone 5s, and the battery life seems to be about double what the description suggested.  I am guessing that if I was using just Bluetooth the battery life would be shorter.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker at a very reasonable price.",5,1,2016-1-5,1,0,0
Impressed with the clear sound of this speaker even when using high volume. Before purchasing this speaker I was using Bose & Sony BT speakers & this speaker is a step up & way less expensive.My only wish is that I'd like a back/repeat button on the speaker but they probably couldn't fit in on to the unit.,5,1,2017-3-27,1,0,0
"when I first opened up the box I realized that the speaker is a lot smaller than what I thought, although this speaker is small, it is really loud and you can hear it from a far away distance.

"Another not very loud tiny bluetooth speaker that 1. (specific to this speaker) On/Off is vague at best-push power for on, push and hold for off, it's usually silently draining the charge because 2. It is a pain to connect, I watch a lot of short YouTube videos for information, so I want sound so I can walk over to the kitchen and still hear. Instead I spend 5 minutes every time fussing to get this speaker to connect. Often I'm done before this speaker has done anything. (Not too dissimilar from similar speakers, but more trouble than the older one I have) 3. Sound is always at max. I bought this because the reviews talked about how loud and good the sound is. My MacBook Pro has pathetically tiny speakers, this isn't much better. I will say that my iPhone 6s connects better to these devices than does my computer.The new millennium seems to have brought back the silent movie. Why is sound connecting and levels such a complete pain? I purchased this speaker and use Bluetooth, because my MacBook Pro has terrible speakers, and the headphone plug doesn't work--has never worked--most of the 5 years I've had it.

They've earned this 4.5-star rating, not because Oontz Angle 3 is the preeminent low-cost portable speaker option (note: it isn't), but by managing their ratings very carefully via superior customer service.I'm now on my third Oontz device in under a year. I bought my first one in March. When it broke in June, I posted an appropriate review here and the people at Cambridge Soundworks were kind enough to send a free replacement.

I can't see why anyone would go and pay several hundred dollars for a Bose or other high dollar brand these days when the sound quality of these newer less expensive systems is so good.

"Small, light, rugged, aesthetically pleasing and simple to operate, this speaker plays surprisingly loudly without distortion and with a good dynamic range for the small drivers and bass radiator. Bluetooth pairing and connection is reliable and range is good compared to several other similarly priced units which I've owned.One flaw in the unit I received was that it has a brief fade-in and/or silent gap which results in the start of sounds following silence being inaudible.

Customer service is top notch. No doubt about that. Speaker has a great sound and pairing is very fast. But the usb charging port is extremely cheaply made. It actually came out of the speaker still connected to the charging cord. Once it fails it's over. The replacement that I was sent failed to charge after 6 months. The blue charging light constantly flashed. I did the recommended reset but did nothing. I replaced the battery with the battery from the older unit. It lasted 2 days and that battery failed.

None the less, my husband uses it in the home garage now, and wants to buy the upgraded ones where you can sync two speakers.. Happy Oontz customers!",5,1,2018-1-3,1,0,0

"No wonder why this speaker has so many good reviews, bang for you buck! It's worth it. I took it on a cabin trip and it filled the room, especially if you place the speaker in a small basket/bucket to amplify the sound. The bass is strong enough for the item to bounce off a ledge or something, happened to be a few times. Oh btw, it fell in the hot tub 3 times lol and came out perfectly fine, so it was accidently water tested lol.",5,1,2017-2-21,1,0,0
It was one of those Amazon recommended special deals...I wasn't expecting such quality!  Use it way more than I ever thought I would.,5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"Sound quality is decent...it certainly gets loud considering it’s size, however it loses quality at higher volume, which is to be expected.  Good for taking to work or to the pool.",4,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"Gets so loud, battery is long and easy to pair! It's smaller than I thought it would be so even more surprising that it can get so loud! Good sound quality as well!",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"I bought this around 6 months ago and it's still going strong! The bass is nice and it gets extremely loud, loud enough for a warehouse. It's a great buy and the best one I bought so far. I just want to know why it disconnects or pauses the music sometimes, other than that, it's perfect.",5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
AWSOME little speaker and the price was great.  We now have two of them.  Battery plays all day while out in the yard working on projects and tasks.,5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"I purchased this fro myself to listen to  Pandora with my laptop. Several of my friends have heard it and purchased the same speaker. It has a good clear sound, is easily portable, and seems pretty tough. I am picky about sound as my radios are Bose products. I think this is a great value for the money.",5,1,2018-1-27,1,0,0

This is the greatest speaker!! I’ve had one for almost a year and it works as great as the day I bought it. It has great sound quality and goes really loud for such a small speaker. It’s about the size of a can of pop. Would recommend it.,5,1,2019-1-13,1,0,0
"It worked fine for three months then it turned into a brick.  Yesterday it worked, today it won’t power up at all.

It's nice to have good customer service.",3,1,2017-10-25,1,1,0

"Extremely great quality. The sound is very loud, not only loud. Its bass is extremely impressive. Shakes the table its placed on when on max volume. Does not skip. It has a Very nice crisp hi in the speakers along with bass. Its Packed very nicely and comes with a manual 20 pages. Sounds better then my Bose",5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,1
"Very very good portable speakers! Very good price as well! Highly recommended! If looking for a good bass, this device has it! It took less than 10 seconds to pair, good packaging! I haven't tried the ""water resistant"" YET! But as soon as i get a chance i will defentetly  let you guys know! Know the only bad thing about is the connectivity! it lacks in that department very very much! Oh one last thing, the built in microphone SUCKS! Would not reccomend this device for calling. But then again this is a SPEAKER NOT HEADPHONES SO NO BIGGY! LOUD, LOUD, LOUD SPEAKERS FELL IN LOVE WITH DESIGN EVERYTHING IS GREAT ABOUT THIS DEVICE I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY FROM THIS BRAND!Thanks!",5,1,2015-12-28,1,0,0
Unpredictable outcome.. Previously owned a Cambridge portable tailgate sound system two satellite speakers & a sub woofer for over ten years which just recently failed..  This unit came partially charged & after a few hours of charging playing and trying to top off the battery it failed to complete the second charge and finally drained within 24 hours. Other than that was Impressed with the sound quality  and volume while it lasted. Must have been a fluke.,1,1,2016-4-5,1,1,0

"Hardly used it and it stopped working after 2 months! However disappointing, the customer service via email was amazing.  First a couple trouble shooting items for connectivity, then when that failed - had a new speaker within 4 days without any hassle.

"Was looking for a bluetooth speaker to use out in the garage, etc. Was looking for something that wouldn't sound like a tinny little speaker and found all the favorable reviews for the OontZ Angle 3. For the price I figured what the heck?! It was MUCH less than any Bose speaker.It arrived, I unboxed it, turned it on and WOW!!!",5,1,2016-6-21,1,0,0
"This little speaker has great sound and is a great value.  Bought it to amplify sound from laptop for use with a projector and an outdoor movie screen.  Outdoor movies are now much improved with loud, clear sound.Also great for camping trips!",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

"these are the best out there for the money.  I ordered two for my fishing boat.  Great sound, volume, easy to link to an iPhone and the charge lasts all day.  They will  do fine in a light rain or in spray from the boat.  My only regret is that I bought two, but can only link one at a time to my iPhone, so stereo is difficult.  Bought the waterproof bags to go with them, but the zipper broke on one so my rating of the sip up bag with snap link is a three star....",5,1,2017-6-25,1,0,0
"Bought this for my dad as he drives in a van all day and wanted to listen to his tunes. For the price, this speaker blows me away (no pun intended). The sound quality is similar to Bose and also lasts multiple days before needed a charge. Highly recommend this speaker and I am going to buy one for myself.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"I would say if this speaker was much louder, It'd be great! Especially cause I'm a college student and when I wanna throw kickbacks, this speaker does not do justice. But if I'm chilling in my room and want some loud music its great! The speakers are incredibly clear and the bass is amazing which is probably one of the reasons why it's a four star! Overall, I would recommend it! It's great speakers, just wish it was a bit louder!",4,1,2016-10-1,1,0,0
I absolutely love this. I use it almost everyday in the morning and I charged it after about 3 weeks. The sound quality is hood and it sync to any open recognised bluetooth quickly. I am happy about my purchase.  Well worth the price.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
It’s pretty loud when inside but outside it lacks in sound. I had to put it in a cone to amplify the sound. I coach and the kids wanted music. I was hoping they could hear the music while they practice but it didn’t hold up to its expectation. The cone semi helps but I wished it were louder.,4,1,2018-3-17,1,0,0
"The small design is awesome if you're looking for portability. However, if sound quality is your thing then maybe consider some other options first. To clarify: highs and mids sound great and there is a lot of presence to the speakers, however bass frequencies do not seem to become audible until around 60 hertz, which is really more an upper range for what I would consider of low frequency response. Basically don't expect a lot presence of you are listening to something with actual low end frequency in it because this unit simply cannot put it out.",4,1,2017-4-24,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying I am a huge Cambridge SoundWorks fan which is why I purchased this unit.  I will say next that this unit really fell far below my expectations for Cambridge products.  The issue to me is that there is almost a total absence of bass and low range in general.  The mid and high, however, are outstandingBottom line is this unit is great if you only listen to acoustic.  You will be disappointed if you listen to most other music",3,1,2017-7-15,1,0,0

"I ordered this speaker and it was expected to deliver by Monday but it came on Friday, 3 days early. It sounds great at high volume and mid volume. and the bass is good too! I'm very impressed by this little guy.Update: After a year and a half of using this speaker, I could not be more impressed by this thing. The battery lasts FOREVER, I rarely have to charge it. It does have trouble working correctly when you leave it out in the sun, but that’s a given. When this speaker eventually reaches the end of its life, I would absolutely buy another one.",5,1,2016-12-16,1,0,0
"just what i was looking for in sound and size. If u expect some bass spend a lil more $$..but this is very clear at the highest volume once tirned up thru my device.****speaker does not skip songs..have to use device--& possible take a chance getting caught on the ph at work, had to take a star*****",4,1,2018-3-22,1,0,0
"This Bluetooth speaker connects easily and sound quality is very good as long as you dont get beyond about 10 feet from the source of the Bluetooth signal.  In my opinion, a Bluetooth speaker should have a longer range than that.  Addendum:  Upon learning of my problem, Cambridge Soundworks sent me a new replacement speaker.  The replacement has a much better range.  I have a small apartment and have not exceeded it's range as of yet.",4,1,2016-7-9,1,0,0

"Sound quality is good and speakers can be turned up loud.  Long range blue tooth, which is nice.  Taking off one star because the power plug connection got loose quickly and the front mesh cover has fallen off.
