"I bought this for the Nintendo Switch but what made me really love it was in flight entertainment.  It declutters your whole flight experience; less hassle with the trays, meals, people getting up to go to the bathroom, etc. It's small and light enough that I just leave it dangling by the audio cord (in flight or on the Switch.)The battery lasts longer than my bluetooth headphones plus it can charge while operating so battery life isn't an issue.",5,1,2018-7-31,1,5,1
"I'd say this is the best Bluetooth TX/RX model you can get right now.  Much more reliable than many others I have tried.  The model can both transmit and receive.  In reality people will use the receive mode most often (e.g. in an older car or older hifi that cannot receive bluetooth).  Or if you have a new iphone that you want to use with existing non-bluetooth headphones.  Transmit will most likely be used in aeroplanes (if you want to use your own bluetooth headphones rather than the ones provided by the airline) or perhaps if you have like a very old iPod without bluetooth that you would like to connect to a bluetooth speaker.Pairing is comparatively simple.  Note that the device clears its entire pairing history every time you flip the RX/TX (receive/transmit) switch to the other side.  Pairing the TX(transmit) mode is perhaps more difficult because you will typically be pairing with a BT headphone or speaker.  Once pairing is activated, the TaoTronics will pair with the ""closest"" BT device.  In reality I guess it just pairs with the strongest audio-capable BT signal it can find.  So if there are plenty of BT devices around it could in theory pair with the wrong device, but you'll know when you got it right.  I would recommend that you try to pair with your headphones in a space away from other BT noise to keep things simple.  For example, I once tried to pair the TaoTronics to my BT headphones without success... until I realized it kept pairing with my TV's soundbar in the room next door :)  Moving away solved the problem.  Of course, once paired, everything will work fine until you flip the RX/TX switch (which you're unlikely to do often).",5,1,2018-7-5,1,3,0
"I wanted a bluetooth transmitter for my non-bluetooth Samsung smart TV so I can use bluetooth earbuds. I already have a Sony bluetooth transmitter that has the over-the-ear headsets which work fine, just wanted the option for smaller, less outside sound inhibiting earphones so I can still hear what's going on around me if I want. The TT-BA-07 is small, light and easy to set up, once I figured out how to pair it to my LG earbuds. It recognizes my earbuds every time I turn the transmitter on, so I don't have to pair it every time. Con features: very short (6“)3.5 mm cord for using off the back of a TV audio jack. I purchased a longer cord to connect with the transmitter to the TV.  It also comes with a very short (12“) charging cable, so I purchased a longer compatible charging extension for it so I can keep it charged all the time rather than charge it every 10 hours. I am pleased with this small, but powerful device. I would recommend it.",5,1,2018-5-26,1,2,0
"This is little device is great! I live with my sister and her fiance and they live in the basement room directly under me, and unfortunately my stereo is on the other side of the room and I often want to fall asleep while listening to vinyl but can't. But this little beast really comes in clear. I do hear some machine sounding stuff here and there but honestly I don't mind. If you happen to be a snobbish audiophile or have a fear of spontaneously developing tinnitus don't buy this. You'll just leave a 1 star review because you can hear that background noise or it'll be the one thing that pushes you over the edge into that psychotic break that's been building up. Happy listening!Now when I get stoned at 4 in the morning and wanna listen to Behemoth I won't bother my family (like now for instance). Thanks Amazon!",5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,1
"This is an inexpensive little bluetooth receiver/transmitter that will allow you to turn a device without bluetooth into one with it.  I used it along with a little RCA switcher to connect several audio sources to a bluetooth speaker in my apartment.  It worked as described.  It's simple to use, though you will need to read the directions to figure out how to control it with its single button.  It is best used when paired up with a single device, because the controls don't allow for easy switching around.  When you turn it on by holding down the button, it just looks for the last thing it was paired with.  Which was fine for my purposes, but if you want to move between speakers like you could with a phone easily, I'd suggest something else.But this thing did what it promised and has done it very well, so I give it 5/5.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,1,1
I was really surprised when it came that it was really small but worked great I personally use it with my AirPods and Nintendo switch lite so if your buying it for that I would recommend!,5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,1
"My wife and I don’t watch TV at home, aside from streaming things occasionally. But when we travel, she always  watches TV in the hotel room. I’m usually trying to read and get distracted by the noise.  Finally decided to pick these up and try them out... and they’re great! She can listen on her nice headphones “probably better quality audio than the TV speaker), and I don’t have to listen... and if I want to, i can pair my earphones to it, too (and they’re definitely better quality than a hotel tv.)The only complaint I have are that some hotel TVs don’t have audio-out jacks, some have digital-only ones so this won’t work, and some either don’t have USB jacks or the jacks don’t provide power.",5,1,2019-3-29,1,2,0
This little device is the Best Buy I've ever bought in electronics. It plugged right into my TV I put it on transmitted and I can put on my Bluetooth earphones and listen to my TV to all hours of the night without disturbing anybody.. was really surprised me is that it also has a receiver mode so I can hook it to my Bluetooth speakers add easily transmit songs from my phone or any other MP3 or music device I have. It is a no-brainer by don't buy anything more expensive you don't need it. I was also very surprised how long the charge last on the rechargeable battery inside. When the device was totally dead it charged in a matter of less than 3 hours. My Bluetooth headphones took longer. My neighbors love it better than I do cuz they don't have to hear any loud music or TV at night.,5,1,2018-12-22,1,5,0
This works like a charm on flights. Paired with both AirPods and Jabra 75t Elite. You won’t regret purchasing them.,5,1,2020-2-24,1,1,1
"I've wanted a device like this for an older TV (without built-in bluetooth) but I was afraid that there would be a lag between the picture and the sound. When I first started looking for devices like this a couple of years ago many of the reviews talked about this problem. I know there is an adjustment in the TV settings for this issue but I was hoping it would work without having to do any of that. This transmitter works perfecty. I did have just a little problem understanding how to pair the TaoTronics headphones I recently purchased with this transmitter, but once I understood the steps it was easy. I've successfully connected other headphones and I have and even connected this transmitter with the streamer for my hearing aids. Watching TV and hearing the sound through my hearing aids is great.I will be purchasing another one of these devices for a second older TV.",5,1,2019-4-16,1,2,0
"As a frequent flier I bought a pair of AirPods Pro hoping to finally leave my bulky Bose QC behind. I quickly realized that if I wanted to use my Nintendo Switch, the inflight entertainment system, etc I wouldn’t be able to since they require a wired connection.  This Bluetooth TX/RX helped solve that problem.  Paired it up with my AirPods Pro and now can leave the Bose behind.  I was a little worried that maybe there would be latency/sync issues.  In the videos I have played and the games I have tried on my switch it is imperceptible.  The device is super light weight and compact as well.  I attached some photos to show the scale.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,1,1
"Connected the transmitter the night I got it & it worked fine, second night it would not pair with my wireless headphones. Check to see if my headphones were working okay, & it connected to my cell with no problems. I tried again to pair with my headphones & still did not connect. Returning & trying a different brand. Will not buy this brand again.",1,1,2018-5-5,1,2,0
"I love this device. Had some volume issues at first, but don't know whether it was the fault of the device or me. Probably the latter.Once I got the transmitter to work with my Bluetooth headphones, it has become a great joy to use. I can plug the device into the audio output jack of any audio device, whether it is Bluetooth capable or not, and I'm good to go. Does your computer have Bluetooth? Is it on? Does it require you to use a user interface to look up devices you want to pair with? None of that matters if you use this little device. Pair it once with your Bluetooth headphones. Plug it into any device you want to hear audio from. Bam. You're done. Computer. Amazon Echo. Amazon Fire tablet. TV. Phone. If it has an audio output jack that will accommodate an included audio cable, then you're golden. Keep the transmitter in transmit mode, and it will remember your headphones every time you turn them both on.",5,1,2020-4-8,1,3,0
"I think this is a really good product. I was able to link this transmitter to my in ear monitors flawlessly. I used the transmitter plugged into headphones and linked it to my phone and it worked great, very easy to set up But,unfortunately I'm going to have to send it back.I am a drummer /keyboard player. I bought this transmitter to plug into the headphone out of my small stage drum mixer so that I could bluetooth the mix to my in ear monitors and eliminate the cord from in ears to mixer. The transmitter linked easily but when I hit a drum there was way to much latency.If I hit the kick there was a delay before I heard the sound. While listening to a song on my phone wouldn't expose this latency,trying to play an instrument with a delay isn't acceptable. I was bummed because I really wanted this to work for the stage.",4,1,2018-4-27,1,3,0
"This product works amazingly!  I bought this in a last-ditch attempt to ""convert"" my car radio into a BT-enabled set up.  I love my car radio; it has a lot of options I love, just not BT.Pros:",4,1,2018-10-29,1,3,0
"I bought my dad a 4K LG Smart TV for Christmas one year and a pair of Bluetooth headphones the following year so he could hear his tv from his desk at the back of the family room. The problem was that the tv did not have Bluetooth transmitting capability, so I purchased this little device to fix the problem. Low and behold, the only output on the tv for sound would not work for this device, but thankfully the cable box saved the day. Now he can listen to his football game from the back of the room without the rest of us in the house having to hear it as well!",5,1,2018-6-3,1,8,0
"I got two of these and personally measured their sound latency in receive mode when paired with a known-good aptX Low Latency transmitter - both are consistently around 200ms (aptX LL should be 30-50ish).  I have personally verified my transmitter is aptX LL compatible with two other separate aptX LL devices.  But these are not and it's highly misleading that they title says they are (my guess is it might work as a LL transmitter but I didn't test that because it's not why I bought these).  I'm returning mine.  Do not buy if you need a low latency receiver!(For what it's worth, I verified the TROND brand device with exactly the same shape and design IS an aptX LL compatible receiver and I'll be keeping that one).",1,1,2019-9-21,1,1,0
This transmitter works great for me. I have Iphone 7 and since they eliminated the 3.5 jack (which is sucks) I need a bluetooth transmitter for my phone if I want to drive while listening to my music and charge my phone at the same time. it is really easy to instal. just plug it in to the AUX-IN jack on your car and plug the charger in. you would have to press and hold the on and off button for a while until the light turn blue so it can be connected with your phone. you just need to set up one time only and after that just press and hold the on off button and it will automatically connects to your phone. I carry this with me everywhere from speaker to car to headphone.,5,1,2018-5-7,1,7,0
"I bought this to send alerts from a Uniden radar detector to a Cardo headset in my motorcycle helmet.  The unit is very small, looks well made, and I thought it would work perfectly. Unfortunately, there were a couple of problems. First, I had a heck of a time getting the unit to pair with my headset. This is unusual as I have paired phones, GPS units, and a BMW motorcycle’s audio system to the Cardo without any problem. After finally getting it to link, I discovered that the unit would not transmit correctly if it is being externally powered. On battery only, I can hear the radar detector’s output perfectly. With power connected, the sound is distorted terribly if it’s audible at all. I would not recommend this device.UPDATE:  I determined that the problem with transmitting while connected to power was caused by a ground loop. Not the TaoTronics’ fault. If you are not using it in a vehicle, this will not likely be an issue. If it is, get a ground loop isolator. As far as pairing goes, I still find this unit more picky about pairing than others, but I did get it paired, and once done, the sound was very good. I should also mention that the seller of this item has contacted me every day since I posted the original review with suggestions and offers to help. If they are this conscientious with product support, then all good. Upgrading my review from 2 stars to 4.",4,1,2018-8-5,1,1,0
"I have a number of quality TaoTronics products and have enjoyed them without troubling problems to figure out or fix.  This is why I became so disappointed with this Bluetooth Transmitter device.My Transmitter worked for about a month or so and then started having difficulties pairing and now, it is completely not willing to pair and transmit with any enabled device.  In my case, this was the whole reason for the purchase.",1,1,2019-7-9,1,9,0
Didn't work out of the box... wouldn't charge so item was completely useless. Tried charging for several hours (documentation said charge for 2) and still didn't work. Since the item has generally high rating I'll give it another shot once the refund is processed and will adjust rating if new one lives up to expectations.,1,1,2018-6-5,1,1,0
"Surprisingly small and compact but I purchased this to watch/listen wireless to movies and play video games and there is a noticeable latency between what's happening on screen and when you hear it. My experience is from 4-5 feet away (from transmitter to my headset). If I had to guess, the latency is between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds so, if you're watching a movie, the lip syncing will be off and can be distracting.Now with that being said, if you plan on using this to just listen, this is an exceptional product. Sound quality is good, it's small and durable, and it's easy to use.",3,1,2018-8-26,1,1,1
"The TaoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter TT-BA07 works great with my TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones TT-BH20.  To get them to pair (connect)  I plugged my headphones in to the wall socket with my charge chord like I always do when I am ready to charge them.  Then I pressed the pair button (the triangle) and they flashed blue and red--pairing mode.  Then I turned on my transmitter by pressing and holding the on button for 5 seconds or less.  The transmitter flashed blue and red and then paired with my headphones immediately.  After that, I unplugged my headphones from the wall.  Then I found the 3.5 mm cable for the transmitter and put that on.  I plugged the transmitter into the 3.5 mm headphone jack at the back of my TV and was able to hear the sound instantly.  I also plugged the charging cable into the transmitter (the one that came in the box) and plugged it into the USB port at the back of my TV.  This will keep it charged.",4,1,2018-5-1,1,9,0

After shipping the headphones, I was asked to either sweeten or delete this review. I chose to improve it to 4 stars for providing outstanding customer service.

"Used this to make an older Samsung tv bluetooth compatible with a tower speaker across a room for grandparents.  Struggle a bit then read some reviews on amazon; and one suggested plugging it into the cable box; worked like a dream.  The whole room of people lit up on Thanksgiving when the sound started coming from across the room!  We used it in transmit mode on the cable box with the red and white plugs female ends on the box and the USB charging cable plugged in all the time so grandparents won't have to worry about dead batteries.

"I recently bought a new car that doesn't have an AUX port.  I have a new car, but I still have all of my music on my iPod Classic which I always played through my old car's AUX port.  Now that I have only bluetooth in the car, I needed to find a way to transmit bluetooth from my old iPod.  I thought this unit would be just the thing, but I could not get it to connect as a transmitter to any of my bluetooth devices (not my car, not my Galaxy tablet, not my Samsung Note 8).  I sent it back.I want to add that the seller was terrific and tried to solve the problem with me.  I recommend the seller, and the product may work great as a receiver, but it didn't work at all as a transmitter for me.",1,1,2018-9-24,1,2,0
There is a high pitched noise that comes out of the speakers when paired with this device. It is most definitely the device making the noise because it does not make the noise when the speakers are connected to my phone. We are very disappointed since this adapter had such good reviews.,1,1,2018-11-27,1,2,0
"In my role, I travel almost weekly. Sometimes the airlines selection is worth trying. I don't like being corded to the seat like a Borg, so I try to do as many wireless connections as possible. My tablet, phone, etc have bluetooth, but what do you do about the seatback screens?? You get this little jewel. The size and cable lengths make it the perfect companion for anyone traveling and wanting to use the available entertainment. For me, I carry a BT collar, so the TaoTronics piece fits right in that case. It pairs easily and I have paired it with that collar, a Bose QC and a Bose SoundLink (for work application). Sometimes you have to repair it when you move from one device to another, but it is no big deal as pairing is a snap. I tried it out for a few weeks and it performed so well, I got another one for the missus. She thoroughly enjoys hers and uses a Bose QC as well. It is truly a must have on cross country flights when you are using the airline's feeds and ports. I now only carry one pair of corded buds-and that is for actual calls. Otherwise, if I need a hit a port and go BT, this is THE WAY TO GO!! Charging is a snap, too. I have never run this down all the way, but I have only been on 5-6 hour flights and it takes less than an hour to bring this back to full.One downside is a bit of a noise if you try to charge it while using it on the plane. Think it is picking up on the noise on the plane's power feeds.",5,1,2019-3-28,1,3,0

easy to understand instructions and using for the first time. Unfortunately there was so much static that I was unable to watch television shows and movies without continuous interruption. I will be returning and searching for a new product,1,1,2018-8-8,1,1,0
"It does exactly what you need it to do, so 4 stars there. Unfortunately there's no way to check the battery, so I get to be surprised as I drive home sometimes and it just stops working. Then if I plug it into my car, I get that great hissing as the battery is being charged while emitting sound. For this reason I occasionally bring it into my house to charge when I get home, but that's only if I remember. The killer is when you're unsure how much battery life it has before you go on a long drive and, well, just hope you didn't forget to charge it I guess.This would be a 5/5 product if there was any indicator on it of battery life. A small, LCD bar would have been perfect.",4,1,2018-12-12,1,7,0
"This device worked just as I needed it to. I have a surround sound system throughout the house with wired speakers and a TV in my kitchen which is where normally sit to watch the games and such. I needed to be able to connect my TV to the stereo/surround sound to get better sound while watching a games, in the kitchen hanging out with family and friends. This device made the connections easily and so far I can't see any delay.

Was skeptical about purchasing a Bluetooth transmitter because I had heard they can be disappointing. Fortunately that wasn’t the case with the TaoTronics - it works great. My husband is quite the audiophile and is very difficult to please but he was very impressed with the sound quality when he used this with his iPod. Haven’t used it as a receiver yet but as a transmitter we’re very satisfied!,5,1,2018-6-13,1,1,0
"This little guy is awesome. My fiancé and I can’t do without it when we are traveling— we use it to connect two sets of Bluetooth headphones to the same device to watch movies or tv together. There’s a great video tutorial online for how to connect two devices that don’t have an interface to actually select the transmitter for pairing, which helped us a lot because it’s a little tricky. Once you connect the first time it’s almost automatic though. I’ve also used it to get Bluetooth audio in my car, and to transmit from a record player to a Bluetooth speaker. The uses are endless and this little box has become invaluable for us!",5,1,2018-4-30,1,1,0
"Be careful purchasing if you are wanting low latency for use with in-ear monitors.  This device says it uses aptX low latency - your receiver/headphones also need to be low latency as well.  (Even then, the latency will likely be ~40ms, which could be too much for some musicians.)Dropping this to one star because TaoTronics continually pesters me via amazon email because of my earlier review informing buyers of the low latency item.",1,1,2018-4-22,1,8,0

This item was purchased after discovery that Bluetooth does not support shared or linked connections for audio receive for 2 headsets.  The 4.1 transmitter plugged into audio output of my MS Surface Pro 4 and was able to pair with both Bluetooth headsets recently purchased to share watching movies on overseas flights and in Europe.  I had to turn volume on my tables to 100% and use the level control on each headset to suit each listener as I have hearing loss and my wife does not.  Also did not notice any delay or stuttering as noted by other reviewed on this device.Why does Microsoft not support this feature as there are thousands other that want do use multiple Bluetooth devices to receive sound via Bluetooth?,5,1,2018-5-29,1,8,0

"This device is great! I’ve used it in both tx and rx modes. It works with my BT headphones to watch late night tv without keeping others awake. So as long as your set has an analogue audio out jack this will work.  I usually use it with my old Bose radio/cd player on the aux input line so I can stream music to it from my iPad or iPhone.

It's super nice to just always have my earbuds connected to it and then the second I turn the transmitter on, to be able to listen to whatever is happening on my phone. It's extra convenient because now I can use my phone without worrying about expensive earbuds tangling on door handles or other objects that might be sticking out.The TX option is also super convenient when connecting two Bluetooth devices and works really well. Both actually stay connected at 15+ feet!",5,1,2018-7-10,1,1,0
"This is great little device, it will make your sound system Bluetooth . Now you can listen to your device via wireless. There is one thing you need to check for on your device. It must allow your device to send the sound out to non speaker type device. Some sound systems will ONLY go to speakers. Example: My TV (Samsung 32"") will only allow sound to go to external speakers. This TV is not a top of the line it is for bedroom use only.So if you need Bluetooth and your system allows the sound out to non speaker devices, this will work for you.",5,1,2018-5-10,1,1,0
"I love this device.  It works greats for almost everything.  Here is a break down of all my uses.  I've plugged it into my 47"" LG TV's 3.5mm Head phone jack and I've been able to connect through Bluetooth, Sony XB20 speakers for surround sound.  I have two XB20s and the only issue I've had is that I have to turn off the TV's built in speaker, otherwise I'll get an echo effect.  However, there is no lag between the audio and the video, everything sounds in sync.  When I don't want surround sound I can still pair it to my Jay Bird older model ear buds with full volume control and no sounds issues.  I have also plugged it into a PS4 Controller's 3.5mm connection and used it with the same ear buds while gaming. Battery life is awesome and charging time has given me no issues. The only down side I've experience is recently with the new purchase of Beat By Dre Ear Buds Powerbeats3.  These do not seem to work well at all with this device.  You can get a connection and receive sound, but I have no volume control what so ever, and the volume is very low.  I have to use my old ear buds for now if I want to watch TV using ear buds.  I have not tried any other Beats such as the solo, so I'm not sure to what extent those would work with this device, if at all. Still a 5 Star product in my opinion.",5,1,2018-4-28,1,2,0

A very good product...I did have a problem the 1st time...It took 10mins to get it to work...once it worked I have used the transmitter to hook up to my Bluetooth headphones...also used it to my Bluetooth speaker(hooked up to Samsung tv 46'' 8000 series ...Onkyo tx sr606 receiver headphone jack)...I didn't have any Bluetooth equipment until I read about your product and took a chance...for less than $30.00 I was really impressed how well it transmitted to headphones and speaker...too bad that it can transmit to 2 devices at once...I have also bought a transmitter only device too... I  really like like this product...I would buy this product again...thanks,5,1,2018-9-7,1,1,0

"I bought this to use on my projector so I didn't have to run 3.5mm sound cable all the way to the front of the room where my sound bar is. It works great.  THe only issue is you can't charge it while using, otherwise you get a very high pitch sound that ruins the movie. To solve this, I use a separate usb power pack up on the projector to charge it.  The other downside, it you have to hold the button down for a few seconds to get it to connect after powering on. Overall a great buy.",5,1,2018-8-28,1,1,0
"I use this BT Transmitter to send the audio from our movie projector to a remote BT speaker approximately 12' away under the projector screen. Older BT transmitters sometimes had unavoidable lag issues which is acceptable for music only applications but for AV use (movies, TV shoes, etc..) you can not tolerate lag as the audio starts trailing the video and gives you the dreaded ""lip sync"" problem. Newer BT devices don't introduce lag and happily this BT transmitter is lag free for AV use. Now we don't have to worry about anyone tripping over the audio cable from the projector to the speaker in the dark... and no ""lip sync"" issues.Another plus is that the projector has a dedicated USB power port and this BT transmitter/receiver can be plugged in to power when running, so we could view endless movies and never worry about the BT transmitter/receiver running low on battery.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,1,0
"Unit works ok, but has a signal delay enough to see the lips move on tv before hearing the words. I originally bought this to play my guitar thru a pre-amp and into my blue tooth headphones.

"You need to stop selling this! I read that you could use with up to two Bluetooth device with it. After making three calls to TaoTronics support . Call number 1 they told me the manual is wrong and they have not updated it at this point. Weird because 100%  of the time you get the manual in the box with the project. Yes, I do know you can download it off the internet before you buy it. That pointless if the manual is wrong! Support is right it will only connect to one Bluetooth device.  After her talking to 10 mins and I could not get her to stop to ask questions she hung up on me. Call number 2 went almost the same way but this person told me that this ""TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter and Receiver, 2-in-1 Wireless 3.5mm Adapter (aptX Low Latency, 2 Devices Simultaneously, For TV/Home Sound System)"" will only work on TV and that;s it.  Call number 3 I ask to talk to a manager and they told me there is no manager.I think my only problem I have is the ad needs to be truthful and tell you that this adapter only works with one Bluetooth device.

"I really was hopeful with this product because I love watching movies late night so this would be perfect foe my Bose QC35. First product arrived and it has static sound in it, thought it was just the audio connector so I made sure it was hooked on properly but still have static and worse when you turn the volume up! I figured it could be just a defective product and I really still want to have a bluetooth transmittee device- So i asked for a replacement- 2 day shipping later it arrived. I plugged the new one in; this time the volume is very low! the other piece of the headphone doesn’t recieve any feed so I tried it also on my Beats wireless just to be sure that wasn’t the Bose having the issues- same thing-only one speaker works- volume is minimal- as much as I hate not having a bluetooth transmitter I will have to return it because of 2 defective products I recieved from Taotronics- wished they would do a thorough quality control on their products so it do not create hassle to consumers",1,1,2019-1-10,1,8,0

"I originally bought this for use with my Nintendo Switch on a long flight across the country. Paired to my Sony over ear headphones (Sony MDRZX770BT - slightly older model, but supports AAC and apt-x), I had a great experience. I played my Switch the entire 6 hour flight out and 4 hour flight back, after only charging the TaoTronics device once before leaving on my trip. The battery life is superb, and so is the sound quality. I had no problems with latency at all. I also had no problems with volume despite being on a noisy plane (I wasn't even at max volume on my Switch).I wanted a device like this because I didn't want to plug anything into the USB-C port on the Switch. I felt it would get in the way if I wanted to hold/rest my Switch on the tray table on the plane. I also bought a USB-C audio transmitter that was more expensive just to see how I like it. I ended up returning it and keeping the TaoTronics. I had a different TaoTronics Bluetooth receiver a few years ago that I used in my car, and I had a good experience with that device too. So I figured I'd try them again; I was not disappointed. I also liked the versatility of the drive. Being able to use it as a transmitter and receiver, being able to use 3.5mm (1/8th inch, aka aux or headphone jack) and red/white composite cables made it a better value and nearly universally compatible with other devices or applications, while also being cheaper, compared to other devices (like Nintendo Switch specific Bluetooth audio devices).",5,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0
"This was very simple to install - nothing to it.  Connected right away, and was able to broadcast excellent quality sound to my headphones immediately. I used it for TV sound - just plugged it in and charged it up, connected to headphones, and boom - instant sound IN the headphones, no sound in the room.  Perfect.  Also, charge lasted okay - completely through a long evening of sitting and watching/listening.  The next night (didn't charge in between) it faded a bit after 3 hours, but that's to be expected - had to charge it right up then it worked fine.  Highly recommend it - good piece of equipment!",5,1,2018-9-24,1,1,0

It is very small and lightweight (you can see the size compared to the iPod in the photo).It comes with cables to connect it to a TV or cable box so you can get TV sound on Bluetooth speakers or headphones, but I have not tried it that way.

It could not have been easier to set up.  Switch one to Rx and one to Tx, and they pair right away.  There is very little latency in the sound transmission, though I do notice some.  If I play a YouTube video using this setup, the sound is slightly out of sync, just enough to notice.  It was inconsequential to this purpose, and would not matter if you were using them to transmit music only.  But, if you are trying to use these for video, you might be wary of this issue.Aside from the slight lag in the sound transmission, these things are great.

"This Taotronics bluetooth transmitter/receiver plugged into a Yamaha DGX 650 keyboard paired with a Taotronics headset easily. But then there were two problems rendering this product unusable. First problem - volume was very low even with Yamaha keyboard volume turned way up. The second problem, the latency from keyboard to headset made this transmitter useless. Impossible to play the keyboard with such a significant lag to the headphones. Hence the one star rating.I am upping this review from a one star rating for the items mentioned in the paragraph above to a four star rating due to the unsolicited customer service provided to me after I posted this review.

I purchased this to hook to my projector I have mounted in my ceiling and connect to my stereo for movies. It worked great and connected to my Bluetooth device but I noticed when watching movies and the sound gets low on the movie during certain scenes...say when someone is whispering or the scene is very quiet this device quits sending the signal but will kick back on when the sound increases making it incredibly annoying when watching a movie. I thought I had a bad device but read in another review or two that it happens with other people as well. I think they mentioned it as some type of power saving feature which is the dumbest thing I have heard of because when I use mine it is plugged in and still does this. So don’t purchase this for movies. I am disappointed.,1,1,2020-6-11,1,3,0
"I like watching TV in bed for a short time before going to sleep, without disturbing my sleeping wife. I had a wireless TV headphone set that was beginning to give me problems. Since I have a Blue Tooth device on another TV in another house, I decided to go the Blue Tooth route. Unfortunately, that device is no longer available, so bought this one. I simply plugged it into the headphone jack on the TV and use it as a transmitter. I have never had need to try the receiver function, so I can't comment on that function. As a transmitter, it has a very good latency. i.e. lips are (usually) in sync with the sound. Although, rarely, there is a noticeable difference between lip movement and sound. In general, this is not a problem.I have two issues with this device. 1. I usually need to re-pair it with the headset. As a result, I re-pair it every time I use it.  This unit is very easy to pair and so is my headset, so no big problem; and,  2. This issue is more important to me. My other Blue Tooth transmitter will power down if it loses connection for about 5 minutes, so all I have to do is shut off my headset and go to sleep. This one will NOT power down, It just continues to run down the battery until I get out of bed and shut it off or let the battery run down.",3,1,2019-8-5,1,3,0

"It’s very simple to use and in my experience has very reliable connectivity in receive or transmit modes. It’s has the expected sound quality of this kind of device. It’s well made and smaller than expected.My only issue with it is that on transmission mode the device automatically “sleeps” once the source audio is too low. Once sound passes a certain threshold it wakes up and audio quickly fades-in. This is quite annoying on Nintendo switch and AirPods because you have to crank the volume on the Switch up to max (to prevent the taotronics from sleep mode) and since AirPods have no volume control of their own it’s just max volume the whole time with no control. Flying around on Starlink or walking around in Zelda is particularly annoying because once music, shooting or action is done and all that is audible is wind, footsteps, or flying the device will sleep until something louder happens.",5,1,2019-1-31,1,1,0
"I initially had a problem pairing this 2 my headphones 4 my Zune. It's kinda difficult 2 tell that the item that U want 2 have paired, is indeed paired.

This li'l device works like a charm &, 2 me, is totally kool.

"Purchased as a transmitter for my iPOD classic. Difficult to pair, actually had to pair using my iPhone (with phone bluetooth off), then switch to iPOD after finally got a connection with my earbuds. Once connection finally made, pairing was no longer an issue. The show stopping problem is that the unit cuts in and out when listening at low volumes, or when the music has a quiet passage. Will be working fine at louder levels, then when when the music has a quiet passage, the sound will cut out, then noticeably come back on (repeatedly) until the music gets to a louder passage. If your music is always loud with no quiet passages (or you listen at very high volume levels) this will likely work for you. If you listen at low volume levels and/or your music has any dynamic  range with very quiet passages, I would not recommend.",1,1,2019-1-31,1,6,0
"This thing is a very helpful little gadget to give your dumb TV or other device Bluetooth.Pretty easy to figure out and the instructions are enough to get you started.

Simply charge the adapter, plug the RCA or 3.5mm cable to an OUTPUT (labeled OUT), press and the power button for a few seconds to turn it on, and if it doesn't already go into pairing mode (red and blue flashing), tap the power button twice. Then go to your BT headphones and set that to pairing mode. Then just hope they pair. (Turn off your phone's BT to make sure that the only two devices in pairing mode will be the adapter and the headphones.) Give it about 30 seconds, then you SHOULD see the adapter go from flashing red and blue to a slow blue fade pulse to tell you that it's paired.

"I bought this to listen to music in my car without using an aux cord because the aux cord made it impossible to charge the phone and listen to music at the same time. I had a little trouble getting my iPhone to ""find"" the device even though both were turned on and in range. Once it connected the first time, it didn't have any issues connecting during subsequent drives. The sound quality is no different from when I have my phone plugged in with an aux cord. It's mildly annoying that you have to power on the device every time you crank the car; it would be cool if it just came one when the car cranks as long as it's plugged in. The only issue I've had is that sometimes my music app seems to have problems with this device. I use Spotify, and occasionally the music just stops and won't start again. It shows that it's playing but I can't hear it through the device. This never happened before I started using this device, but I don't know if the issue is with the device itself, with something in the Bluetooth settings, or with my iPhone. I have a fairly new iPhone and the Spotify app is the latest version. The problem comes and goes. For this price, I can deal with the fact that it's not perfect. I haven't used it as a transmitter, only as a receiver, so I can't speak to how well it works for that.

"I am using the TaoTronics Bluetooth TX-RX adapter to listen via wired headphones.  I've tried several bluetooth headsets (over ear, earbuds, etc.), which I use to drown out background noise while writing. I do this almost daily for many hours. I find it helpful not to lose my train of thought when I get up from a session if I have ambient sounds drowning out my noisy home. I also have a lot of experience in audio recording, which makes me a bit of a stickler for fidelity. In the past, I have been satisfied with cheaper headsets so long as they get the job done. The Cowin E7 was a reliable headset, excellent battery life and range, good sound isolation, but poor sound quality. I learned to live with the muddy and unbalanced sound due to its other strengths. The hinge broke recently, and my attempts to repair it failed. My many wired headsets hung pleadingly from the walls, so I figured, why not convert these beauties to bluetooth?In short, the TaoTronics adapter works in this application, with some pros and cons.",4,1,2019-6-12,1,1,0
"(Full disclosure: I've raised my rating from three to four stars, after TaoTronics gave me a gift certificate.

Furthermore, to be honest, the problem I complained about before (see below) no longer bothers me as much as it first did. I now use these earphones for listening to news, talk shows or podcasts, so my original complaint is no longer an issue. And some other brands have these same issues.)FYI for people who might use these earphones for (e.g.) classical music: This device turns itself off if the volume of the content goes ""too low"". Turning up the volume from the source brings audio back, but at a higher volume than previously set, so one has to lower the volume, until it happens again.",4,1,2019-6-6,1,2,0

I reversing the order for the two BT headsets (the other was some Sony cans), with the Sony set connecting first, but then the Airpods wouldn't connect.Also, unpairs too easily.  And, to use them with my TCL TV, I need to unplug them from the back of the TV when I'm done, or it'll block the sound to the TV speakers or receiver.

"If you had asked me to review this a month ago, well, I was ready to throw it out.  I had given up on using it...never had problems connecting to my bluetooth headset, and experiences no latency issues, however, sometimes sounds was in one ear, sometimes in the other, rarely in both at the same time.  Then I upgraded my home wifi.  The TV I was using this with was a streaming only TV - no cable hard wired in.  And it was a fairly lousy connection but I was generally able to watch TV.  With the addition of some Echo devices though and a desire to have more reliable and faster wifi, we installed a Google Nest mesh wifi.  I turned on my TV...and it was amazing how much better my streaming experience was!  I decided to give this gadget another try and WOW!  I'm blown away at how great it is.  Guess the crappy wifi was affecting sound streaming as well because now I love listening to my TV through my headset (TV isn't exactly IN my kitchen but I like having it on when I cook and it's a better listening/watching experience when I have the characters right there in my ears).  I've used this with two different bluetooth headsets and it pairs well with both and neither experience obvious latency.  One set is a cheaper pair and the other is also by TaoTronics, Sound Liberty 97.  The latter really only likes to be paired with one device so when I have used it with this after using them with another device it takes longer to pair, but that's on the ear buds, not this transmitter.

"This Bluetooth connector is excellent.  I have used it on many flights for both my Nintendo switch and the airline seatback movie player, and it is a great device to have.  I can connect my Bluetooth headphones easily, and the sound quality is great, with no latency.  Not having wires to manage when you or your seatmates get up to use the bathroom is really wonderful.  At home, I have used it to play switch games on the big screen while using my headphones, so as not to annoy my wife if she is in the same room.  The battery life is very very good.  I fly overseas once per year, with flight times of about 15 to 17 hours, and this device has made the whole trip on a full charge without ever dying.  Plus, it can be charged while you use it if you ever run into that need, which I've been able to do from the seatback USB ports some planes offer.  I have to say the range is pretty good too, we have a long distance from our living room to the bedroom, and it has not dropped out on me yet if I've paused my game and went to get something from the bedroom while keeping my headphones on.  I've used it sparingly as a receiver, with great results as well.

"I have had this bluetooth transmitter and receiver unit in my arsenal for only three months.  I find myself using it constantly.  It can be used to transmit and receive bluetooth audio to and from virtually any device.  Pairing it in TX for transmission and RX for reception is very easy and straightforward.  I have discovered the control button can function as a play/pause button when receiving bluetooth audio.  This can be a great help if the transmitting device is close to or within range of this bad boy.  The short stubby audio patch cord which comes with this device can be easily swapped for a longer audio patch cord.  Same is true for the micro USB charging cord.  Attaching the RCA plug adapter to the audio patch cord allows to you transmit and receive via a pair of RCA jacks.  Traveling and storing this unit with your other equipment is as easy peasy as can be.  It can easily fit into your pocket, purse, or anywhere else.  If you plan to use this device with a pair of bluetooth headphones or headset, it can easily fit into your case with a headset or headphones.  The Bluetooth 5.0 technology, which this unit features, is state of the art, and is backwards compatible with earlier versions of Bluetooth.  This means that you don't necessarily need a Bluetooth 5.0 device to use with this unit.If you want to add Bluetooth flexibility in every sense of the word, you have found the perfect device to do just that.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"Maybe I have a defective device given the other good reviews. However after 3 hours of charging for the 1st use, was very unstable to connect (Tx mode) from my non-bluetooth receiver (1/4” phono plug to 1/8” adapter to TT-BA07 with provided cable when using with Jaybird Vista BT earbuds.  Poor volume when finally connected and always a pain to connect. Even worse when trying to pair with AirPods Pro. Fully turned up maybe could hear something - and pairing took multiple attempts. Also checked the 1/4” to 1/8” adapter and receiver output settings with my 1/8” wired headphones that that worked fine. What a pain. Returned to Amazon (who was very helpful for the return).OK - so now the update - I was contacted by customer service about the issues I was having. No matter what I tried I could not get this to pair with the AirPods Pro with any volume. So they sent a replacement - TT-BA-09 Pro.  I would suggest resetting the TT-BA-09 pro twice (turn on in TX mode, then turn off. Switch to Rx mode turn on, then off, go back to Tx mode - on - off, Rx mode - on - off. Finally back to Tx mode.  Don’t know if this was unique to my unit that it needed to be a clean clean reset - but no concern to me - it worked!  Connected to AirPod Pro with very good volume.  Only request would be that the max volume could be a bit better with the AirPods Pro (doesn’t seem to be an issue with my Jaybird Vista’s).",4,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I bought this little item about two years ago, as I had just purchased bluetooth headphones and wanted the option to connect to my TV without disturbing my sleeping husband.  It worked like a charm, but I didn't actually need to use it much.  Fast forward to 2020.  We are now  streaming TV shows and films on Amazon Prime and BritBox and because my husband has tinnitus, he needs a clearer audio signal and more volume than I do.  We each have a Bluetooth speaker, and although I found various hacks to connect a computer to two Bluetooth speakers at the same time, I could not get this to work for me.  Invariably, if I connected to one speaker, the other would cut out, and I could not use the computer speakers AND a Bluetooth speaker or any other combination.  It was one or the other, never both.I remembered this small item specifically stated in the instructions it will transmit to two devices simultaneously, and though the output for the Bluetooth speakers was dismal, I was able to connect both of our Bluetooth headsets with no problems.  This relatively tiny device solved the problem neatly, using the audio output on my computer and a USB port for power.  One warning; turn off the Bluetooth on any other device within range before you set things up.  If another Bluetooth signal is active, it will interfere with your initial set up.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"The product description mentions AptX LL support. However, AptX LL is only supported when the device is in TX mode. In RX mode, only AAC or SBC works. If paired with another receiver, it seems to work only in SBC (there's no obvious way to verify which codec is in use since no forms of indicators are available) as the receiver does not support AAC in TX. Therefore if you plan to use a pair of these, you WILL suffer significant audio latency. If you plan to use this as a receiver with a relatively recent phone as a transmitter, latency won't be as bad, but it's still noticeable.",3,1,2020-1-25,1,2,0
"This is a tiny little device about the size of two matchbooks.  Much smaller than expected.  I suppose that’s a good thing, as when it hangs from the mini 4” line-out cable it puts very little stress on the jack.  That is very good.I wouldn’t mind there being more buttons, as I prefer dedicated buttons for each function over the trend of having one button that does everything using a variety of clicks and holds which I must memorize.  I needed to keep the booklet with it to know how to operate it.  It’s not too difficult, hold for 5 seconds to power on/off, then two clicks to pair with speaker.  Once unpaired from the phone, and only then, will it connect to the speaker, and it does so via holding them in close proximity.  I was concerned how I would do the pairing without a screen, but it wasn’t difficult and worked the first time.  It was actually my second attempt, but my first attempt I hadn’t successfully unpaired the speaker from my phone.  I had gone into Bluetooth settings on my phone and clicked disconnect, it said it was disconnected, but that didn’t do anything.  I had to turn the speaker off first and then click disconnect in my phone settings.  Then I turned this transceiver off.  Then I started over.  I turned it on again, saw the blue standby light, did the two taps and saw the red/blue blinking that indicates pairing mode, turned the now-unpaired speaker back on, and within seconds they were paired and working as desired.  The instructions say to hold the two items within 3’ of each other to pair them.",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I don’t have anything to compare this to so these are my Bluetooth Transmitter Naive results. Connectivity is easy and signal is really strong. No signal drops even when walking to other rooms and around corners. I opted to connect via the headphone jack on the front of my Yamaha AV A-820. I had to buy an adapter at a local electronics store in order to get this to fit in the headphone jack.... the headphone jack on the Yamaha is larger than what this transmitter has. Maybe it came with one and I threw it out? Who knows, but it was only a few dollars.  I have 3 different headphones/ earbuds I use this with.. Bose Soundsports, Jaybird Vistas and Sony WH1000-XM3.  Sound is strong in all 3 with the Sony’s sounding the best (duh)  The volume is as loud as I will ever need it to be for oldier movies like Led Zepplin , The Song Remains the Same. There isn’t any noticeable lag time between the video and audio I am picking up from whatever I’m watching. I would definitely recommend buying this because it’s a lot less expensive than buying a new receiver with a built in Bluetooth Transmitter.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I ordered this to use with my blue tooth ear buds on my TV, since the TV is not blue tooth ready. I didn't know until I was setting this up that my TV did not have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Luckily this device came with a Red/White RCA to 3.5mm adapter, which saved the day. My blue tooth ear buds paired with this device immediately with no issues at all.The title mentioned one major draw back, and here it is. I was hoping that if I mute the TV I would still be able to hear it through the ear buds, but no such luck. The only way to kill the sound from the TV speakers, but still hear it through the ear buds is to turn the TV speakers off in the settings. Then when you don't want/need to use the ear buds, you have to go back into the TV settings and turn the speakers back on. Kind of a pain, but it is what it is.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I tried, I really tried, for 2-3 days, to connect this device to my wireless earbuds.  After a very nice phone call with a TAO technician, who suggested I do a reset for the earbuds, I contacted the earbud manufacturer.  The Tao technician was right, the earbuds had to be reset.  One would think that technicians who work for the earbud company would know how to instruct a user.  The literature with the earbuds was useless.  The videos they sent me too were useless.  The literature on that manufacturer's website was useless.  I searched youtube myself, and readily found the video that taught me how to fix the issue, and I achieved connectivity.  Now, the reason I gave this unit only 4 stars - for wasting too much of my precious time.  By the way, I've used this system for a few hours and have to say it was a pleasure - my earbuds worked well, I was able to redo pairing without issue, and no noticeable latency.",4,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
"This product worked great for about 2 years--I set it and forgot about it, connected to the audio-out on my TV and it would reliably connect to my MPOW bluetooth headset. I found the latency to be minimal and the audio quality to be good (for TV at least--I'm not an audiophile).Then it stopped working, out of the blue.

"I wanted to have this product transmit from a stereo radio to my Jabra Active Elite 65 true wireless earbuds.  The connection was easy/flawless.  The only difficulty I ran into was ""repairing"" after taking a phone call.  When my earbuds were ""listening"" to the radio and a call came in from my paired iPhone7, the phone call took precident and I could answer.  When ""hanging up"" the phone, the stereo would not reconnect/send sound to the earbuds.  However, the indicator on the  TaoTronic device indicated it was still paired.  I would have to ""turn off"" the TaoTronics device, then  re-do the pairing process to get the stereo back.  TaoTronic's tech service worked with me on the issue (as did Jabra).  Unfortunately we never came up with a solution.  But, I will say TaoTronics was great to work with...very professional, responsive, and more than met my expectations as far as trying to help solve the issue.  I would not hesitate to buy from them, it is just that this product for my specific need did not work.  I think the use for TV to headset, iPhone tx back to a speaker or radio speaker would probably work flawlessly and with excellent sound transmission.",4,1,2019-2-17,1,1,0
I don't understand how there are any good reviews for this product. As some of the other 1 star reviews state there is audio drop out during low level audio. All of my issues were in TX (transmit mode). I never tried the RC (receiver mode).I ordered this primarily to watch movies on a TV w/ BT headphones. Within the first 10 seconds of the first movie I watched this (audio drop out) occurred. Background dialogue completely cuts out. Any musical score that is going on totally cuts out.

Yes, I can report that it really does support simultaneous pairing and yes, it really is low-latency. I found the lip-sync to be nearly perfect.While streaming audio, I turned off one of the two paired headphones, waited a minute, and then turned it back on again.

"I bought this because I have two other Taotronics receivers that worked well. I wanted to use this as a transmitter, but it is an epic fail. It is easy enough to pair but the sound sucks. It sounds like an old record with non stop snap, crackle and pops. I tried a different cord between this and my lossless player but to no avail. Perhaps I can use this as a receiver but that is not why I bought it. I say again, don't bother!Revised: Taotronics reached out via email and offered to replace or credit me for this flawed product. As stated above I have two other units that work perfectly. Acknowledging that a certain amount of manufactured units will suffer from defects it then comes down to companies making the effort to right the mistake. I raised my review to 5 stars because Taotronics did make it right without my even asking. This honestly puts Taotronics in the forefront of customer service and should give you confidence that should you happen upon a flawed unit you can be assured they will go above and beyond to make you a satisfied customer.

It lets me and my partner listen to the same podcast, exercise app, or music at the same time (it's basically a headphone splitter).

"I purchased this to allow my older smart tv connect to my bluetooth capable receiver, not only to enable me to hear tv via my Bose speakers, but to allow me to use headphones for tv when needed (occasionally a neighbors tv is a bit loud. Well, REALLY loud). Attempt one failed as I did not at first realize my L/R audio input on the back of the tv was in actuality an output! Oops. This meant I needed to use the optical digital audio output to analog converter, which I fortunately already had on hand. Once I hooked it up to the optical audio jack via the converter, worked like a dream! No delay, good quality sound, quick pairing capability and best of all, my receiver remembers the taotronic so it pairs automatically now.

"Let’s just get the cons out of the way because this device is awesome! I’m not too impressed with the volume controls. While I understand there is a limit as to how high my iPhone/iPad will play, I didn’t realize I’d have to turn up my speakers to such a high level to get decent sound. Having said that, once I adjusted everything I could change the volume on my iPhone/iPad with ease. Something else to consider that I haven’t experienced yet is that in the instructions, it says that when switching from transmitter to receiver mode, the device itself will lose the devices previously paired. I’ll have to check this out to verify. I’ll try it with an old CD player and see what happens. Anyway, on to the pros. Once paired, I was able to connect my iPhone to an older stereo and play decent quality music. I then connected to my sound bar and it worked like a dream. I noticed plenty of people asking this, and thus the answer is yes, you can charge this while using it. The light will turn from shining blue to purple.

The TV volume control only works for the built-in TV speakers and does nothing for the headphones.

Within seconds I was listening to my MiniDiscs wirelessly.  One thing I will note is that it seems to pair with anything that's discoverable in the area.  Every time I turn it on at my desk it pairs and links with my headphones and an old Belkin Bluetooth receiver that I have hooked to my computer speakers.  It defaults audio to the Beats, but the light stays on on the Belkin too.  Other than turning one device or the other off, I'm not sure how you could switch between paired and active devices.

"I used this in my TV so I could watch movies on bluetooth headphones without disturbing others in my house while they slept.  I have an earlier version that I tried first and the lag between audio and video was horrible.  I figured I'd give the newer version a try and hope the lag would be gone.  While the lag is better, there is still a lag that makes watching a movie impossible.  The audio is just a little behind the video, but enough to be noticeable.  There is also an annoying hum or buzz when the audio in the movie goes quiet and then it clicks back on when the audio in the movie starts up again.  It's just annoying and both of those features together takes away from watching the TV or movie.  I ended up plugging in the headphones directly, which negates the use of a bluetooth transmitter.  I know the issues are not headphone related because when I plug in the headphones directly to the TV the problems go away.

The headphones would often not connect at all - I would leave the device on 24/7 and just turn my headphones on/off when using the computer. I had to re-pair my headphones a number of times, but the issue kept coming back. I also ran into a ""low volume"" issue - I'm not sure exactly what was happening, but when I was listening to things that had parts that were of low enough volume, the BT stream would seemingly fade in/out as if it were thinking the audio had stopped.Between the inability to connect to my headphones most days, and the weird audio cut-outs, I hucked this thing and went back to wired. Not worth the frustration.",2,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"When I bought this I needed a Bluetooth receiver for my camper so I could quit hotspotting to my iPad just to listen to music. So the only thing I really wanted was just the option to pair my phone to it. I was planning on camping soon so I ended up going with a receiver that had the fastest delivery date, which was this guy, even though it seemed kinda pricy at $30. When I got it I tested it out in my camper. Pairing to my iPhone was painless and went as you would normally expect. Interestingly I seen the switch on it that said TX and RX so I looked in the instructions to see what that switch did and to my surprise I found out that it had the ability to transmit too. I read on further and found out that it could also transmit to two devices as well as receive from two devices too.I haven’t tested out the double pairing yet and I probably won’t until I go camping again in two weeks but when I do I’ll test out the functionality and update this review again if something is off about the device.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"If you're like me and you wanted to listen to your computer's audio with your bluetooth headphones than what you need is a Bluetooth dongle, not this.  Plugging this guy into your computer or speakers will NOT make it transmit audio.  This device doesn't work like that (I bought another one exactly like this from Best Buy and the Geek Squad guy told me it isn't meant for PCs).  Shame on this seller for tricking me into buying something this device wasn't designed for.However, this does not mean it isn't worth it for your own needs if its not regarding your PC.  I can't comment on that because I never experienced it working.  But the one star is deserved.  Don't lie in your descriptions.",1,1,2019-9-12,1,2,0
"I bought two devices of this kind, from different manufacturers and was able to compare them thoroughly. At the time of my purchase TaoTronics was a bestseller on Amazon. And EUASOO (another similar device which I bought) had a higher user rating. They cost exactly the same at that time. So, here is a list of reasons why I choose TaoTronics. Maybe someone who chooses between these two devices (as I did at the time, but as a result I bought both) will find this useful.• TaoTronics is able to automatically reconnect to AirPods after AirPods are temporarily manually connected to iPhone to answer incoming calls, etc. Yes, not quickly (25-35 seconds) after the end of the conversation, but at least like that. But EUASOO cannot reconnect to AirPods at all after temporarily manually redirecting AirPods to iPhone for a phone call. You have to turn it off and turn it back on for that. And what if you are relaxing on the couch? You need to get up, go to the adapter, turn it off and turn it back on. Therefore, this is a biggest epic fail compared to TaoTronics. This drawback alone would have been enough for me to no longer consider that EUASOO or another similar product with this huge disadvantage for purchase. I don't know why manufacturers do not mention this crucial point in the description.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter and Receiver - GREAT!Needless to say, I am impressed with this transmitter/receiver. This is the fourth of this model I have purchased from Amazon over the past several years. All of them are still serving me flawlessly. They have been a pleasure for me to use on all of my electronics, including TVs , desk top and lap top computers  and a tablet.  They have served in  my need to improve my hearing impairment to the point of me being able to clearly understand and enjoy the audio portion of all of my electronic devices. I highly rate the product because it has good volume control, sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity.  I particularly enjoy the freedom of moving about the house without being followed by wires.  Whoever invented Bluetooth  is a lifesaver to me.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
This is by far the best bluetooth receiver I've had. Previous ones I've purchased have resulted in an unbearable high pitched tone that makes listening to podcasts or music impossible. I've used this TaoTronics one only as a receiver in my car. My car is a little older and does not have an installed bluetooth system but it does have an AUX input. This connects easily to my AUX input and I use the USB cord to keep it connected to a power source. This is all located in my center console/arm rest so its completely out of the way. Once I turn the power on the receiver it seamlessly connects to my phone. Its one of the faster connections to a 3rd party bluetooth device which has been nice. The sound quality is superb and there is no noticeable difference between using the receiver and connecting my phone directly through the AUX input (which is how I previously had it connected). Its nice to be able to charge my phone while listening to podcasts or music. I definitely recommend this model if you're searching for a high quality bluetooth receiver for a very good price.,5,1,2018-10-8,1,1,0
"I bought a new Sony flat-screen TV, (supposedly) Bluetooth-capable, but I could not get any of my pairs of Bluetooth headphones to connect to it so that I could watch TV without disturbing the neighbors (thin walls) or my wife (thin patience for anything above louder than a 6 on the volume).So I did some searching and found this. It's easy to connect, right out of the box, and a single charge is good for several hours of TV watching.

I ended up swapping my transmitters on both my TVs to make things work as my older tv did have a 3.5 audio out plug. I wish this came with a audio out Optical to 3.5 cable.

I tried it in multiple combinations but could not get it to pair!  After resetting the Taotronics, I finally got it to pair and it was working fine for a few days.

We're wanted  it to provide a better sound system to our playing 45s at our local American Legion.

"I had a problem. Every time I went to my kids house for the weekend I was unable to hear their TV. They simply don't turn up the volume - ever. They won't turn it up for me or allow me to turn it up either for fear of waking up my grandson. After searching for a solution I landed on the TauTronics Bluetooth transmitter and receiver.A PERFECT SOLUTION! I can use it by attaching it to either the headphone jack on the TV or the red/white RCA outputs on the TV. The difference being that connected to the headphone jack cuts out the audio from the TV. The RCA jacks feed an audio sound the the TauTronics device without interfering with the normal sound from the TV. That means I can put on my Bluetooth headset and listen at my preferred volume and, they can watch the show at super low volume.",5,1,2019-5-6,1,1,0
"This helped my marriage. Yes, it did. You see I am, for all accounts, mostly deaf. That's my fault though, I listened to my music at ultra high volume all my life. With headphones. Yeah, I know. SO...anyway. These kept my wife from leaving me. She is an early riser, so early to bed she goes. I, on the other hand, am not. I like to watch tv and listen to music while everyone else in my house is trying to sleep. That's not easy with me there in the living room, listening at FULL volume, to some Aphex Twin. They didn't like me much. I bought these to quell those desires to physically hurt me. It worked. I like sound, and this little gadget allowed me to hear that sound, all by myself, and with great quality. And I am still here, and still married, and well, just here.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"It's nice that a product with this functionality is available but the major drawback, at least in my setup, is that the volume is not loud enough.  The Bluetooth earbuds I'm using work in many other scenarios and often these earbuds can be very loud but this device with the referred Bluetooth earbuds  did not give me the volume range that I would have wanted and expected.  Perhaps they are afraid that the trial lawyers are going to bring a lawsuit claiming that the device permanently damaged a clients hearing.  The manufacturer has nothing to fear in this area.Perhaps the device should have been named the ""Bluetooth Whisperer"".  ""Can you hear me now?"" might be a good label.",2,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0

"Works very well. I originally bought this to give my very old iPod bluetooth and play music from it to a wireless speaker, and it worked great for that.  However, it also came in very handy when my more modern iPad stopped connecting to my Prius C's Bluetooth system. For months I tried troubleshooting the issue, and eventually I decided to just give up and use this Bluetooth for the iPad in the car. Somehow (I suspect jealousy), the iPad miraculously began connecting to the Prius C's sytem again. I don't know what witchcraft caused this result, but I'm not questioning it.Great for giving devices with a headphone port Bluetooth. Also good for inducing a jealous rage out of your other Bluetooth devices.",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"I wasn't sure if this would work as expected, but I did what everyone said: charged it up before and paired it with my Bose QC35 prior to traveling in a place where it wouldn't have any conflicting signals. Well.... it was a treat! Worked from San Francisco to London and back - not direct flights so that meant the signal worked for probably about 14 hours without issue. I did also plug in my volume control dongle on the way back (Air France hasn't turned down their announcement volumes) and it all worked beautifully.The joy of not being attached to the screen when you have to get up and down for fellow passengers can hardly be described! Also not getting your legs/blankets/tray tables caught up in the cable was just brilliant.",5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0

The only downside is that the instructions are terrible and it took many tries (on different days) to get it to work.

"Used these to connect with both original AirPods and the new Airpods Pro and they both connected fine but the volume level was too low for practical usage.  Whether I was using a phone or laptop as the source of music to transmit ,I would have to turn the volume up to 1/2 before I could hear any music and even at full volume the sound was very light and would be far too quiet to hear on an airplane which is what I was hoping to use it for.  It did pair automatically with the AirPods after the initial pairing which is helpful.  I will be returning them, I now see that other reviewers have had the same low volume issue when transmitting to AirPods.Update: customer service support was excellent, they promptly provided a refund and went above and beyond providing an Amazon gift card for my trouble.

Pairing to my ear buds takes about 15-30 seconds. Signal strength is strong - it rarely cuts out. Range is about 25 feet unobstructed but I can go to an adjacent room without loosing the signal.

My work computer monitor has speakers bult into the monitor itself and my regular corded headphones make my daily life at work difficult when I go to move about my desk and forget I'm connected to a cord. I bought this thinking it would help make my working life a little bit easier. The first transmitter I purchased was the Upgraded Version TaoTronics Portable Bluetooth Transmitter for TV, AptX Low Latency Wireless Audio Adapter for 3.5mm Stereo, Pairs Bluetooth Headphones/Speakers which I bought for $19.99. I returned it due to the NOTICEABLE feedback I was hearing in my headphones. This ""static like"" sound in the background over everything that's playing is also noticeable with this product. As someone who struggles with sounds, this is infuriating. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the fact I have Bluetooth ear budes and not over the ear headphones or large stereo headphones but the static feedback is something I personally just can't handle.I am also experiencing the low volume issue where it just STOPS transmitting and I have to go back to my web browser and click back on Spotify to make sure what I'm listening to is playing.

Very easy to set up and use, and it’s a much smaller device than I was expecting — which was a good surprise.I gave it 4 stars because it beeps when the battery is low and needs recharging, and since I use it to sleep, it’s a bit annoying because it wakes me up. I wish there was a way to turn the beep off, or maybe have a light indicator instead? (The beep is common to pretty much ALL blue tooth earphones I’ve tested though.) However, the battery life is better than average; it goes one full night without beeping, and only beeps on the second night; all blue tooth earphones I’ve tested beeped sometime during the first night.

My Studio Beats have volume control on the side and work perfectly when paired with my iPhone or iPad. But when paired with this transmitter the volume buttons on my headphones do not work.

The sound is clear and I cannot detect any distortion.  The Diginex are generic, inexpensive earbuds, so I’d expect that the Taotronics Bluetooth device would function well with most other earbuds. For my Apple Air Pods Pro, however, the output power from the S22i is not sufficient to drive the AirPods Pro.I called Taotronics tech support (the phone number is listed on a card in the box) and was connected quickly; shockingly so, I must say. The technician was courteous and efficient, and she told me (as I had suspected) that the TT-BA07 is just a pass through Bluetooth device without any amplification.  I asked if any other Taotronics Bluetooth devices have amplification capabilities. She said that she would check with the engineering team and send me an email the following day. The very next morning, I received an email stating that none of their products have amplification capabilities.

I also love that you can switch it to sending and receiving audio. I've used it to connect multiple bluetooth headsets to output the same sound and it just works. The only thing that is unfortunate is that you can't use it to receive calls in your phone so when you have your phone connected to bluetooth, music will play in your car stereo, but when someone calls you, it will not pick up the voice from the call to your car.

"When I saw a post recommending this device, I was doubtful at first. I decided to take the risk and bought it, and I couldn't be happier now. The Bluetooth connectivity has virtually no latency; I played the Space Pirate Trainer without any latency, which killed the immersion when I was using a different, cheaper Bluetooth transmitter. For Beat Saber, there's a setting that adjusts the sound latency in-game in the ""setting"", and with 300 ms (max) it was  no different from having a wired headphone.Above is my modded Oculus Quest. As you can see, the transmitter is so small that you wouldn't notice any weight changes. It can also be used without the power bank, if you haven't bought one already. Some people would swear by the wired headphones being better, but I disagree. First, if you are a serious VR gamer, you should use something that can be used with the PC (i.e. ""wired""), like the Rift. Second, the wires easily get in the way when you just take off to wipe the sweat off your face, or just moving around even with the short wires; that really becomes irritating and distracting to say the least.

I am only worried i will leave it on a plane someday because it is small and stays out of the way.The sound is good.  My only issue is sometimes when starting up it does not connect to my headphones so I need to go through the pairing process.  It is not a big problems because the process is fast and once it is connected, it is solid.",5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
"I was really impressed with the build quality of this and overall its a nice looking and small package.However, it will not work the speakers/application that I intended it for.  I've followed the instructions and tried in various ways and it just won't connect.  Part of it may be that the Bluetooth speakers they are connecting to do no have an explicit ""pairing"" mode that they can be put into, they simply broadcast and accept any incoming Bluetooth connections.  The instructions for this transmitter state that the receiving device must be put into pairing mode, so I am guessing that they are detecting for a standard signal that is only present when a device is in pairing mode, and so my speakers are no good.",1,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I have only used this on airlines, as a way to use my own Bluetooth earphones with the IFE. It works exactly as advertised. Battery life has not been an issue in that I have not had to charge the adapter in flight. For $30, this is a steal. Now, for balance, I will say that working out precisely how long a press needed to be to turn it on and off versus initiating pairing was an art, and the instruction manual was not super-helpful. Also, the adapter for the left-and-right specific channels that some airlines have has some crackling, suggesting it is quite cheap. But this is a $30 device that is super-small and also two-way, so you can connect it to the hotel alarm clock or speaker when you arrive, and *it works*. I wondered whether this was not more of a four-star product, and truth be told it is… until, again, you remember that this is $30 and frees you from the cable in exactly the kinds of spaces where space is at a premium. You won't love it - a 2.0 product is needed - but you'll thank yourself that you bought the 1.0 regardless.",5,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0
"My experience with intermittent Bluetooth connections and poor lip sync with my video caused me to give up on this item and return it to Amazon.  I was really anticipating a good wireless solution between my video projector and my sound system but this item was, unfortunately, not it.Among the policies to like about Amazon is the ability to return items right away that do not performance as expected and receive a full refund.  When UPS scanned this returned item my account was immediately credited.  Therefore there was no loss and no fowl.  Although I rarely need to return items, it's comforting to know that if an item does not perform as expected I need not take a loss on it.",4,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
"Every once in a while I come across a product that truly surprises me.  This little inexpensive bluetooth receiver / transmitter is one of those items.  It worked perfectly right out the box.  I use it in my car and have it in Rx (receive) mode.  It works perfectly.  My car is a 2005 Acura TL so it doesn't have bluetooth audio built in (it can do first generation bluetooth with phone calls that only works with phone calls).  I installed an aftermarket 3.5mm jack and was plugging in my phone.  I decided to see if I could find a bluetooth receiver to install so I won't have to manually plug into the car (yeah, first world problem to be sure!).  I installed a USB to power port that only gets power when the car is on and leave the TaoTronic plugged in.  Then plugged in the 3.5mm from my car to the device and select Rx and it worked flawlessly.  I do turn off the device when I park the car at night and turn it on for my morning commute but my iPhone 7 connects immediately every time.  I thought I had an issue once, but I realized that the volume on my phone (which thinks they are headphones) was turned down.  For the price, I have be extremely pleased and have to give it a 5 stars.  I didn't expect it to work this well.  The sound quality is great and so far it is performed perfectly.  It appears to be a quality unit.  I can not speak to longevity yet as I have had it installed for a couple of weeks.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
I purchased this product in order to provide my husband with a way to turn up the volume when he is watching TV without blasting me out of the room in the process. It has worked so well in so many ways.  He finds the TaoTronics headphones that we also purchased very comfortable and he is able to hear dialogue much more clearly than when it was coming from just the TV speakers.  I was a little concerned about whether such a modestly priced product would do the job.  No worries. It has performed like a champ.It also has demonstrated great range.  I occasionally use the headset myself and find that I can wander throughout the first floor of our house and never lose connection with the transmitter.,5,1,2019-5-30,1,1,0
"I was having trouble dealing with long wires running from my sound bar to the projector hanging on the ceiling. It was ugly and clunky. A friend suggested a Bluetooth audio adapter. This was the first one I found. It works. The sound is great. My only complaint is that it sometimes takes multiple tries (2-3) to pair with my Vizio soundbar system. I'm not sure if it is the fault of the sound bar or the adapter, but my soundbar pairs on the first try with everything else we connect to it.The sound is great. I get surround sound from my budget projector. It's exactly what i wanted. I just don't have anything to compare it to. It's sort of annoying to have to stand up on the couch to turn it on and pair it each time, but that is the only negative and I don't know how you would get around that.",4,1,2019-4-7,1,0,0
"Update: Opportunity came up to use this again.  Turns out the 3.5mm audio cable that came with the unit was bad, and that's why the sound quality was horrible.  Swapped out cables and the quality is fine when using as a receiver.  Haven't used as a transmitter yet.---",3,1,2018-6-3,1,2,0
"Was elated with respect to the ease of setup and size of the item.  Unfortunately in TX mode, there is about a 1/4 of a second lag (250ms).

"What a great product.  I am so pleased with this transmitter/receiver it's one of the best purchases I've made in several years.  I travel to China every 6 weeks and use my Sony BLE ANC headphones to watch movies in flight and listen to music on my iPhone.  The most annoying feature of my headphones is the cord to the seat back screen.  Every time I shift in my seat or the person next to me gets up I have to deal with the cord pulling, tugging, popping out of one end or both ends.  This unit solves this problem and works flawlessly.  Connects immediately, easy to use, small, light and hold a charge for the entire flight from SFO to Hong Kong.I will not travel without this transmitter, period.  Great job Tao Tronics",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"I have an iPad 6th Generation. Purchased this specifically to use on the airplane for a trip so my daughter and I could watch movies on my iPad that I had downloaded. We both have AirPods. After doing a ""practice test"" at home before my trip, I can say this successfully worked extremely well. We were both able to use our Bluetooth AirPods to watch all our movies. One thing to note, we had to turn off our Bluetooth capabilities on the iPad for this device to work and then pair the device with each of our AirPods. Highly recommend this splitter.  It's small and lightweight, held it's charge for our 5 hour flight.",5,1,2019-5-26,1,2,0
I purchased the TaoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter because of a problem with out of sync sound with video through my phone to headset using the Roku app. Upon receiving the transmitter I immediately plugged the 3 mm jack into my TV and turned the transmitter on. I then set my headset to pair while standing near the transmitter and within seconds it paired. There is no lag and I can walk outside and still not lose a connection. I am totally happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone who needs to use their headset jack on their TV to connect Bluetooth headset. This model all allows two simultaneous connections which is a big plus. It has a rechargeable battery so in order to charge it I connect it to the USB port on my TV. It allows you to use Bluetooth while charging which is extremely convenient. It also lasts at least 6 hours on battery alone. A heads up you must remove the 3 mm jack from the headset port on your TV to get sound if you set your TV to turn off the speakers when a headset is attached. I highly recommend this Bluetooth transmitter.,5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I was searching for a gadget that would prolong the life span of my Power House Hardon Kardon audio receiver by having Bluetooth capabilities for audio streaming and the Toatronic Bluetooth adapter does the job exceptionally well. Also, it is extremely small and remains out of sight if you need it to. The clarity is great and I have not experienced any sound quality issues at all. The distance is great as well, I went upstairs with my phone and it kept playing audio on my receiver. I love it when a product does what it is meant to do and keeps its promise.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,1
"This works well so far. It’s small and out of the way.  It comes with an RCA cable and 3.5mm jack, is easy to pair and the sound is good and there is no delay (tha5 I can tell). However, one thing I noticed is that when you plug the included usb cable into the same device your transmitting from, there is a noticeable high pitch. It’s very distracting. It’s not present when you plug the usb cable to a normal power supply, though.",4,1,2018-7-16,1,2,0
"Have had this for over a week now. I have been mainly using this in transmitter mode where I plugged this into the audio output of my non-bluetooth projector and connect to my bluetooth speaker system. First of all the device is very compact which I like as I don't have like a big thing hanging from my projector. Followed the instructions provided and pairing the device with the bluetooth speaker was easy. Based on some reviews that I had read, I always keep the device in charge mode while using it and I haven't seen any lag with the audio. Very happy with this purchase.Update:",4,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"Ordered this in Sept. 2018 the input audio jack has a short and sounds fades completely out on or channel (stereo) and I have to go wiggle male Jack to get working again. It may work for awhile or in 30 minutes I have to do it again. Also the range is pitiful. At 25 feet it starts cutting out bad and there's nothing in between but a glass door, I can see the transmitter. No excuses to make such a piece of junk. (UPDATE) OCTOBER 20, 2019. TaoTronics cared enough about their products and customer satisfaction that they sent me an upgraded Bluetooth unit at no cost to me. Let me tell you, the new model is FANTASTIC so far!! It's model #TT-BA014. First to everyone.....this company CARES and i WILL buy from them for any of their products that i want. Most companies just say, send in for repair or replace the exact product if in warranty, but TaoTronics went far beyond and reached out to me and asked me if they could send me an upgraded replacement unit. I was so excited and of course said, "" Sure!""  Please, give TaoTronics a try. You can buy with confidence that they will see your 100% satisfied! I sure am. Thanks, TaoTronics.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"I use this as a bluetooth transmitter from a classic ZUNE to a pair of headphones while at the gym to avoid bothersome wires while working out, as ZUNEs are not bluetooth enabled. The device plugs into the ZUNE headphone jack with the included 4 inch mini plug cord and has a much better output than other transmitters I have tried, both in volume and frequency range. It tucks easily into the soft arm case I have for the ZUNE and stays charged for about 12 hours of use.  The extended warranty is nice but hopefully I won't need to use it.Note: I was asked to write a review by TaoTronics which I had intended to do, and the above is an honest review.  However, they requested I review and in exchange would send me a pair of Bluetooth, noise reduction headphones for free.  The headphones are complete crap, do not hold a charge for any amount of time and are useless.  The 5.0 transmitter is still working fine however.",5,1,2019-4-3,1,0,0
"UPDATE 2: they keep offering me a refund to delete my review or change it to 5 stars. NEWSFLASH: reviews are meant to reflect the user's experience dealing with the company. I found that their product did not perform as advertised. Offering me a refund is fair, but I feel that with a refund, a 4-star rating for my trouble and wasted time is reasonable, especially since the potentially misleading product information persists. I'm downgrading them again to a 1-star review again because they continue to offer good customer service not in good faith but as a bribe for a perfect review.UPDATE: my complaint is real---the number of Bluetooth devices it can transmit to is far more limited than e.g. what a Bluetooth headset can transmit to---but the company has been admirably persistent in reaching out to me to offer a full refund. So my review goes from 1 star (not a fully functional ""transmitter"") to 4 stars (still doesn't do everything ""transmitter"" implies, but the company stood behind the sale).",1,1,2018-10-13,1,0,0
I use this mostly for watching television and playing video games with Bluetooth headphones. It does the job with some caveats and it's easy to use. It has connectivity throughout my small apartment for the most part.There is always a slight hum and popping sound on the line which may be less noticeable if you turn up the volume on the connected device. I know it isn't from the TV because it happens when connected to other devices as well such as my radio or my PS4 controller. There is also a delay of nearly one second which is somewhat bad for watching television and even worse for playing video games. This device is best suited to audio-only applications such as listening to the radio or to podcasts or when you want to have the news on while you do other things.,3,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"This is my second unit - the first one was used as a receiver for an older car without BT. This one I used as a transmitter for a wireless connection to the TV sound on an airplane to pair with my wireless earbuds. In all cases, the units perform flawlessly and are easy to connect. I had a problem at first connecting this unit, so I emailed customer support. I received a reply within hours with detailed instructions. It turns out, the problem was with the earbuds I was pairing with the unit. After a factory reset of the earbuds, everything worked perfectly. Customer tech support is excellent. I would highly recommend this company and this BT receiver/transmitter.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"I plugged this device into the sound card on my PC, switched it to transmit and without any prompting, it immediately found the Taotronics Receiver on my Powerwerks PW50 amp and started playing. The sound is a HUGE improvement over a stereo patch cord I tried. The cord was supposed to be shielded, but there was tons of noise on the speaker when I plugged it in. It was also cumbersome and annoying, so win-win!Next I'd like to find my Y-connector so I can use my PC speakers and Bluetooth simultaneously. I might update this review at that time. For now, I love it. I can use various PC programs to play music (and other things) over my amp. Neat.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I purchased the first one through Amazon.  It worked for a few hours then died.  I thought the battery had discharged.  I was unable to get the red charge light to come on and it never worked again.  I returned to Amazon and received a replacement.  It did exactly the same thing.  I called the tech department at TaoTronics.  The agent was most helpful and accommodating.  He offered to send another, send a different type, or refund my money.  I elected to get another in kind.  It arrived in a few days and just to make sure it wasn't already fully charged; I turned it on and ran the battery down.  Then charged it to full charge.  It worked perfectly.  Easy set up and pairing.  I have now used it with headphone speakers by splitting the sound from my TV.  I definitely recommend  this item.

I chose this bluetooth transmitter, over the cheaper model, because of the reviews.It was easy to hook up.  Now, I can wear headphones or ear buds and listen to the tv at whatever volume I want.  My wife can set the tv volume at whatever she likes.  Yesterday she had it at 0, and I could sit and listen to it comfortably. (she had it at zero because she doesn't like to watch fishing shows.

Only problem is...they are not bluetooth, so I decided to get an adapter thinking it would solve all of my problems. Well, it did...sort of. It took a bit for some devices (Google, Alexa) to discover the device but once it did, it connected without issue. However, playing music from Google via YouTube left a lot to be desired. Very choppy no matter which way I set the switch, so I moved the device to one of my Echos to use with Alexa.

"I use this to send audio from my  computer to sennheiser wireless headphones. This produces a great quality sound and after a year an a half the battery still lasts about 20 hours. I usually just leave it plugged into a charge so I probably killed the life of the battery more than regular use would. I still had a signal outside of my house and down the street about 250ft away. Seems to transmit though glass but has very poor signal in my garage. Actually any signal at all in my garage is surprising cause it has to transmit through a brick wall or steel door. Anyway, this is a very small transmitter but surprisingly high quality for the price.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"The sound quality on this is very good and overall it connects decently enough (some connection mishaps with my Bose headphones, but not enough to warrant any major complaints).My main gripe with this product is the battery. While I'm sure it lasts a long time on paper, in practice it becomes annoying to manage. I keep it plugged into my work computer, and if I don't turn it off when I'm done using it then it sits there overnight flashing and is drained by the next day. Meaning I have to replug it in to recharge it. I could just keep it plugged in, but once it reaches a full charge there's some static feedback in the sound, so I have to unplug it at that point and the cycle repeats itself. This could be solved if this bluetooth adapter had an automatic power-off timer of about 10 minutes or so, but it doesn't look like such a timeout exists. So I have to do this plug/unplug dance every once in awhile and it gets a little annoying.",4,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0

"Material feels sturdy, light, and high-quality. Texture is gently grippy, quite a pleasant feel, in my opinion. Came without any bumps or scratches on either the transmitter itself-or any of the cords it came included with. Mode toggle switch is firm and clicky. Can't easily be switched using just a swipe of my finger, have to use a little bit of nail (but is easy with just a little leverage) which I consider a good thing because it means it will not accidently switch when I run. It's a little larger than my iPod shuffle, which is what I intend to use it with. Is not any thicker, just about half an inch taller. And maybe 2cm wider. Is actually lighter than the shuffle, even with the auxiliary cord included. Controls seem confusing, at first, but just after reading through them twice I consider myself pretty fluent with them. Pictured with the shuffle, a quarter, and a dollar bill for scale.P.s. came charged, which I appreciate because the user guide recommends charging it for two hours before first use.

So I can be listening with the phone thru the TaoTronics and when I put in my hearing aids and switch them on the audio immediately routes to the aids and drops from the radio.  Neat and convenient.  The one minor annoyance is recharging.  I suspect I use it about 1 to 1-1/2 hrs/day and need to recharge it weekly, so it looks like you get about 10 hrs use.  More would be nice but this is good.

"I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to connect through Bluetooth, my Sony wireless headphones to my Samsung smart TV.

Now at first I tried a connection to the TV using the audio left right cable, but no luck, so then I connected the transmitter to the cable box ""audio, left right ports"", and it worked. I want to also point out that I have a Bose Solo 5 soundbar connected to the TV, if you have a similar connection than you will need to turn off that soundbar, no need to unhook anything connected  to anything else, ""Just The Transmitter to the Cable Box"".

I use this product with my cheap portable radio.  I enjoy fm radio and didn't want to spend $50.00+ dollars on a radio that has bluetooth builtin.  I've also used this product to watch Tv at night while my wife sleeps.  It works well.The Bluetooth connectivity method isn't the best.  I use a pair of Bose QC35 headphones to connect with this device.  Sometimes I have to use the connection wizard/bluetooth pairing method everytime I turn them off; this happens when I connect to a different device (like my phone) then attempt to pair with the TaoTronics device later.  Not a big problem but I thought I should mention it.  My headphones normally remembers every device it pairs with but the TaoTronics sometimes requires me to use the  connection wizard/bluetooth pairing method more than I'd like to.,5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
This bluetooth transmitter is so little you can easily hide it in a pocket.  You just have to connect your 3.5mm Adapter wire (included in package.  It is easy to connect just hold the power button until it goes into pairing mode. I have it connect to my iphone and windows 10 computer.  I have used this for several hours at a time and so far I have not run out of power yet. I don't know exactly how long the rechargeable battery will last but I have used it for about 7 hours one day and it didn't die.When I first received my transmitter I had trouble getting it to connect with any of my BT electronics.  TaoTronics was very responsive to help resolve the problem. So should you have any questions or issues rest assured that TaoTronics customer service is really good.,5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Initially, I was a little bummed when I realized instead of  3.5mm or RCA jacks, the only ""audio"" out on my television is ""optical/digital"". I was on the verge of ordering a converter when the light bulb went off. I looked on the back of my Dish receiver and Viola! I plugged the transmitter into the RCA jacks on the receiver and I've got Bluetooth. Very happy with the sound quality and the range seems to be further than advertised.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,1,0
"This is a great aid for devices that don't have built in Bluetooth.  It's pairs quite easily and remembers the two headphones I paired to it without having to re-pair them.  The battery life is extraordinary,  I have used it for 12 continuous hours and still had power to spare.  The range appears better than described, I have been able to go up to and maybe over 50ft away without losing fidelity.  Also don't experience much interference when outside unlike some other BT devices I have used.  I haven't used the transmitting function yet, but if it's comparable with the receiving, then I would be happy if I needed that function.  I would highly recommend this device.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0

I bought this to watch tv with wireless earbuds so I don’t disturb my wife at night. This was completely new for me and after researching Bluetooth transmitters I decided to try this one. After figuring out the TINY directions I got it to work. (Had to figure out the earbuds too) This solves a big problem for me and I’m so happy I got my setup working.

"The TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter and Receiver is much better compared to my old Bluetooth 4.2 transmitter from another brand in the following areas:-there is no more sound delay when watching movies because of the aptX Low Latency technology, I also use it to monitor sound wirelessly when I shoot video by connecting it to the headphone jack of my DSLR, it works flawlessly",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0

My Bluetooth headphones would no longer pair with it, and my iPhone, nor my iPad could see it on the Bluetooth settings. Judging from all the positive revues I must have got a lemon. The teeny tiny instructions say it will remain in pairing mode for thirty seconds, but it drops out of pairing mode in less than five seconds.

I needed a transmitter only to plug into my computer and watch Netflix or Prime through my Bose headphones without disturbing my family. I have both the QuietComfort 35 (series II) and Soundsport Wireless. I had to dig through a bunch of forums to find a way for my headphones to connect to the TaoTronics, but once I figured it out, it was fine. It's still fiddly, but at least it works! The key is you have to wipe out all previous connections - connect to TaoTronics, then reconnect to other devices afterwards.",4,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

Now that we've got smart speakers and microwaves and lights and everything integrated with google or samsung, why not make my old speakers wireless as well. Now this wont make it into a google speaker, but it does give me the freedom to connect as many devices as i want without having to go through the hassle of untangling wires in the back and plugging a new audio source. I can just connect with bluetooth and stream my music with ease. I havent used the transmitter function yet so i cant really comment on that, but this little device has been great.

"I purchased two of these for my sister and I, who share an apartment. I purchased two Bluetooth headphones so that we could each listen to our televisions or other devices without hear the neighbors children. These devices work wonderfully and we’re really happy with them. Well, my sister is happier than I am. It seems that my headphones keep connecting to her transmitter, which is through a wall and 15 feet away instead of connecting to my own transmitter which sits inches away. Every time I want to connect, I have to go into her half of the apartment, turn her transmitter off, go back into my room, reconnect to my device, then go back into her room to turn it on. It’s as if her device has a stronger signal or something. I’m not sure, but it’s frustrating, for sure!UPDATE: The company reached out to me and provided both a remedy and compensation for the issues I was having. Very good customer service and support, which is rare.",4,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0

"Right out of the box, the transmitter connected with the Bluetooth headset I was using and is very clear, had a quick connection, and really good range. I was a bit upset when I tried to connect a different headset to it, and it wouldn't search to give me a new connection. I was going to give it a not-so-great review. THEN, I received an unsolicited email from the seller, Sunvalley Brands, with instructions on how to reset to connect with a new device.

I also love that it's rechargeable. Considering putting some velcro pads on it & my walkman so they can stick together vs. it being loose & dangling.

It definitely got louder when I turned it up when connected to my TV's headphone jack but on a different TV it was set this was with Sony bluetooth headphones.I ended up getting two bluetooth speakers as this will support two devices at the same time. I tied this to a two way radio station to allow users in two different offices to hear traffic and it works great. Saved me time from having to run wiring to a hardwired speaker.

I have an older car with an audio jack but no bluetooth. The 3.5 audio jack on my older phone is hosed. Needed a connectivity solution and this adapter works perfectly. Just as nice as a hard wire connection. The audio output is higher when plugged into a power adapter. This may be due to the fact it was not fully charged with first use. I don't care much about battery life  or power output on battery power as it will remain plugged in for normal use. I do care about sound quality and this adapter sounds great. Pairing was quick and easy. I may edit this review after it's fully charged to compare output on battery power. There are less expensive adapters out there but the positive reviews are spot on and made it worth the extra money.,5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"The Bluetooth connected quite easily, so this product worked just fine.  Unfortunately I found out while setting these up my Samsung TV doesn't allow volume control for the TV headphone jack that this was plugged in to.  Sound only came out at a fixed extremely loud volume from the TV's headphone jack.  Then I thought plan B would be to plug this into the headphone jack on my stereo receiver that's connected to my TV.  But then I read the fine print on the instructions that says to not connect it to an amplifier or it will damage this device due to overvoltage.  So they did work well but just not for my TV which isn't this product's fault.  So I had to return it due to no way to control volume for my TV.",4,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
We have a samsung smart tv and although it’s smart it doesn’t have Bluetooth. Our tv doesn’t have a stereo jack either so I used the other included red/white adapter to plug this into the back of our directv box. This transmitter paired up to our Bluetooth speakers but wouldn’t pair with any of our Bluetooth headphones (4 pairs all different brands). When it’s paired to the speakers there’s no way to adjust the volume and I tried adjusting it both from the tv and speakers with no luck. I ended up purchasing a pair of Taotronics Bluetooth headphones to see if they would pair to the transmitter and they do. There’s no latency at all and it seems to be working well but I’ve only had it for 2 days so I can’t say how long the charge lasts. I give it 3 stars because it wouldn’t pair to 4 different brands of Bluetooth headphones and when paired to a speaker there’s no way to adjust the volume. I also didn’t expect to have to purchase more Bluetooth headphones in order for it to work so keep in mind that it does not pair with all Bluetooth devices.,3,1,2018-10-18,1,0,0

I just set it to TX mode, plugged it into the headphone jack, turned it on, put it in pairing mode and my headset connected within seconds. It is small enough to be unobtrusive and slides right under the laptop, out of the way. In terms of functionality, it does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it does it with absolutely zero noticeable lag. So, audio and video is in perfect sync. It just works. I couldn't be happier.

"I love it!  First off, I am only using this as a receiver for my car and can only review the receiving function of this device.  The sound quality is superb in my 135i when compared to the previous Bluetooth 4.2 units I have used, I would definitely say Bluetooth 5.0 is near CD like quality.  I leave it plugged in to the charger and to the auxiliary port at all times and there is no background noise from the alternator. Once I turn it on it instantly connects to my phone with no issues every time.Now the only issue I have is that the unit goes to sleep after a period of inactivity, so after leaving the car and returning from, say, grocery shopping, you have to turn the unit back on,  and I only complain about this because it’s located in an awkward area in my car and is a little annoying to have to do,  if the unit had a dedicated on off switch i believe the battery capacity would be more than plenty to keep it alive even overnight, as a previous unit I had did so.

"I encountered the same issue as some other reviewers with the sound cutting out when playing movies from my video projector with quiet/low volume scenes.  As per a previous reviewer's post: ""According to support, the device has a low Db cutoff feature to save power. So, for example, if the scene audio is a slight breeze with crickets (as it is a lot in ""Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" and many movies, I would imagine), that ambient noise has been cut off and you hear nothing because the unit has stopped transmitting until the audio comes back up above the Db cutoff level. I understand the reasoning for the ""feature"" to save power, but, in my opinion, it renders the unit useless.""I had my TaoTronics transmitter plugged into the headphone audio output jack on my projector which then connected to a bluetooth receiver to my old stereo receiver/speakers.  I finally figured out that the problem was that the output volume was set too low for this audio output port on the projector, and therefore the TaoTronics transmitter was not getting enough audio input volume in order to broadcast an uninterrupted signal.  By simply adjusting the output volume of the projector, it resolved the issue by eliminating the sound cutting out from the quiet/low volume/low db scenes.  So glad that this resolved the issue in my case, as I was about to return the product.  Also am surprised that the vendor's support line was not able to offer this workaround as a fix.

"I purchased this because I was tired of using wired connection for my PC. It would limit my ability to move around freely in my room hence I purchased the transmitter. And does it do a great job as a transmitter. First, it works great and sounds great but the first time using it was a bit confusing. To elaborate, the instructions say press it twice to pair, however, when you turn it on it will already be on pairing mode which I guess is great.Second, I noticed that if you charge it via USB port on a PC while using the device you start to hear a slight buzz. But if you stop charging it; the buzzing sound goes away.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
Great customer service and followup.  I could not find direction to pairing to this unit with my headset.  Finally I did.  I do recommend buying their earphone as they are matched for each other I believe.  It is very small so I can bring it when traveling and watch TV with this setup.  No more complaint from spouse about TV sound.  In fact I may buy another one as the price is good and have it handy at the bed room for TV watching.  You can also keep it charging while being used.  No worry about running out of power.,4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"This Bluetooth transmitter connect to my IsoTune ear plugs easy.  I’ve walked around the house and it stayed connected about 2 rooms away.  When you turn it off, it will NOT auto connect next time it’s turned on.  There is a very slight delay.  If your watching a movie it’s just a bit annoying.  I mostly use this on a video camera to monitor the audio.  The right ear is my shotgun mic and the left is the wireless system.  I’ve not tested the battery life.

Sound quality is fine and the bluetooth connection works well.I had minor interference from my WiFi router when I initially installed the device.

"The unit, when connected, works great. Been using for a couple of months now at work. The pro's are that the range is pretty good and quality of sound transmitted is great. The battery life is kinda average, it can only run for about 8 hours. The other issue is connectivity, once every 10 days or so the adapter refuses to connect to speaker it has been connected to and other devices. It requires a fair bit of jerry rigging and button presses before it can work again. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to numerous bluetooth devices being around, but it starting to get annoying.",3,1,2018-12-10,1,2,0

Next, I hold in the button on my headsets, and, BAM...it's paired.  I plug this into my 1/4"" headphone jack on my amp (I had a downsizing adapter to 1/8"").My only complaint is that it doesn't see to hold the connection.  I use this for watching TV/Video.  So, I may use it for a few hours a day.  But, when I turn my headsets off for the night, the next morning I have to re-pair the Bluetooth.  Since it's simple, it's no big deal.

"We like to watch DVDs or connect to the TV through our Roku stick while working out on our treadmill/exercycle in the basement, but prefer listening through our Bluetooth headphones so as not to disturb other family members upstairs.  I knew I was taking a chance by ordering a product I had never tried, and that no family members or friends had used. I was not disappointed!  I was able to attach the device to our somewhat outdated DVD player (thus eliminating the need to connect it to an amplifier, then to standard corded headphones), and the results were incredible!  I can control the volume using my Bluetooth headphones, and the sound quality exceeded my expectations -- I've never had to turn the volume up to the maximum level.  I liked this device so much, I ordered a 2nd to connect to our Roku box.  Now we can watch virtual scenery cycling videos and listen to the included soundtrack while riding our exercise cycle. This device is easy to connect when following the instructions in the guide (and I a somewhat technology-challenged).  It can also be used as either a transmitting or receiving device.

"I have Bluetooth Noise Canceling headphones from Sony.  They are awesome in the airplane (and not exactly cheap).  I usually have them connected to my phone for music.  However, sometimes I like to watch the free movies on the plane.  I have to plug my headphones into the console which is fine I guess, but it becomes a pain when someone needs to get up and I have to unplug all my stuff.  This solves that.  I can plug the transmitter into the monitor's 1/8"" headphone jack and if someone needs to leave I just get up without worrying about the person tripping over wires.The other use case for it is that some rental cars still don't have bluetooth or I don't want to connect my phone and have it's contacts sync...

"When using in Tx mode to connect headphones to TV, this product doesn't transmit all audio out of the TV. It is not a Bluetooth issue - this product has a cutoff feature where low volume sounds (background music, quiet speech, etc) gets cutoff apparently to ""save power"". This is a huge deal breaker if using mainly to watch TV, where the full audio is part of a good sound experience!!Loud sounds and foreground speech comes through clearly. When loud sounds exist, quieter background comes through as well, but when the sound in the scene is quieter, you hear nothing entirely. It results in an obvious choppy sound effect that sounds at first like Bluetooth connectivity issues, but it is not - it is apparently a ""feature"" of the product.",1,1,2020-8-25,1,1,0

Device works fine. Very small.  Made well.  The drawback is no auto shut off.  As soon as you disconnect Bluetooth from it - it blinks bright light incessantly - as if it is in rectal pain. Yep - just Like Lionel’s dumb tune “All Night Long” and most likely even longer until it burns its a$s out.  If it was less than $20 - you would be ok with this unpleasant feature - especially if you actual enjoy suffering and think electronic devices experience feelings.  I use it solely for TV watching in the evening.  Turn off my Bluetooth headset and TV - our boy here starts to blink as if the world is suddenly out of gas relief pills. I turn it off in the morning when I wake.  I’ll let you know when it finally blinks no more.  It works fine.  Buy it - if you main use is NOT evening TV viewing.  Lol. Enjoy.,4,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0

"I bought 2 units hoping I could pair them with one another so that I could connect my non-Bluetooth stereo with my non-Bluetooth headphones.  The instructions do not describe that usage, but the response from vendor tech support was that they are capable of that.  In fact that scenario works just fine, using one in RX mode and one in TX mode.  Bottom line, I am very pleased.  Considering the various pairs of non-Bluetooth headphones I have around the house, a second TX/RX device was much more useful than spending that same money on a single set of Bluetooth headphones.",5,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
This Bluetooth Tx and Rx worked flawlessly out of the box.  I got it to work that way because I went to the TaoTronics web site and downloaded the user's manual and printed out some copies of the instructions in a readable-sized print.  The manual that comes with it requires an electron microscope to read it.  It is a very fine product and the stereo sound quality is outstanding.  Now you can turn those non-Bluetooth MP-3 players and AM radios into Bluetooth transmitters at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend this product.,5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I use this product every day in my physical education classes. I’m able to walk around the gym and control the volume from my Apple Watch without needing to carry my phone everywhere. When I need attention I’m able to pause and play through my watch which is connected to my phone to the taotronics transmitter. It connects so easily and it’s so convenient that I just slip it in my pocket and plug it in when I jump in my car as well. It’s a great product and has a large range and the audio sounds very clear in both the gym and my car. I have been using this for about six months now, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a transmitter to make any speaker system Bluetooth compatible.The only thing that I wish that this had there’s a way to control the volume when I use it to connect to my AirPod pros. I’m not sure if it was the airplane system or the fact that I cannot turn the volume up on my AirPods. When I was flying last week on Delta Airlines the using the taotronics to connect to my AirPod Pros I could barely hear the audio. When I used any other headphones with an Aux chord I had no problem. Idk if this was due to the fact that you cannot turn up the volume manually on the AirPod Pros, but I do not fly very often and most airplanes give you a set of headphones to use, so it wasn’t that big of a deal",5,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"Arrived on time and is as described/pictured. Easy Peasy to hook-up and pare. I've used it on my TV, PC, and my in-home stereo so I can use my wireless headphones. Last 10 hours on a charge or as long as you want if you leave it plugged into the charger. Great little device. I would recommend this Bluetooth adapter. I have only had this one experience with the seller, but if this product is indicative then I would recommend them.Update: This Taotronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter/Receiver is really great! The range  I can move about on my Bluetooth headphones is amazing. It's easy to use, pairs up quickly, and I've never lost connectivity. I'm ordering another one today. Highly recommend this product and seller.",5,1,2019-5-25,1,0,0
"I bought this to plug into a stereo receiver that doesn't have bluetooth audio out support.  I charged the device, plugged it into my receiver with a 1/4 inch adapter and paired it to my bluetooth headphones with no issue.  I thought all was going to be well until I started listening to content.  The audio drops frequently and there are a lot of clicks and pops in the sound.  I only sit about 8 feet from the TV which should be plenty close.

I can't tell for how long battery lasts, since I plugged USB to computer and it is always on charge. Distance is also pretty impressive. However, I felt a little white noise on connection with Desktop.

"I bought this for a very specific purpose.  I have an app that will not allow music to be output via Bluetooth to prevent feedback.  I used this device to trick the app and transmit via Bluetooth from the audio out jack of an IPad to a Bluetooth capable column array speaker.  I was concerned I would not be able connect because I cannot see the device I’m trying to pair to on the speaker.  This connected within literal seconds, with no issues.  I tested what I thought was a very good range down a hall and into another room with no loss of connection.  I’m sure it will not go too far, but you shouldn’t expect that type of range from a device like this anyways.  Sound quality was perfectly acceptable and I was playing it through a $1700 speaker.  I could not perceive any latency.  For the price this is a handy little device.  Especially since it transmits or receives.  Thanks for helping me solve a problem.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

"This device was purchased to wirelessly connect a set of Bluetooth stereo headphones to an AV Receiver with an integral headphone jack. Attaching the device to the AV Receiver's headphone jack and setting it to Tx (transmitter) mode effortlessly pairs the Bluetooth headphones, which now directs all audio directly to the stereo headphone set. What's more, the stereo sound quality is crystal clear with no detectable latency (delay), which is very useful when watching a movie or TV show. Lastly, the Bluetooth range while retaining superb audio quality is about 38 feet in my environment.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0

"This product connected to my ipod classic and brought the music I had there to my earbuds. I began hearing music from a playlist not on the ipod; don't try the initial setup near your cellphone or it will intercept the phone music and not the ipod collection. It was a bit stubborn at first, but after a few tries connected beautifully. It is about the size of a pack of matches, attaches via a cable into the ipod earphone connection, and gives pure fidelity to the music.Also, be sure to use the TX setting and not the RX one to connect with earphones. Great product, pricey, very good quality.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0

"Many great things to say about the Taotronics TX/RX. I’ve had mine for at least 4+ yrs and still working perfectly, Initially  bought it to be able to use my Bose Noise cancelling headsets during my long and back then frequent International travels. Packing them was convenient inside headphone pack and battery would go around the world easily (not exaggerating and whenever ran out of juice just connected a small charging cable next to the audio jack on the seat. Loved it but then traveling thankfully stopped. That’s when second life started.Always had a set of speakers in my covered patio that are wired directly to the family room area where I connect the speakers to my receiver. About 2 yrs ago replaced a TV for a better one inside the house and moved the older TV to the patio near the speakers. I knew something was not right because was not able to connect the TV audio to the speakers (at least without making a major mess to get any audio cable from theT to the receiver). Suddenly remembered my Taotronics Tx, simply connected the Taotronics to the Audi out of the TV and Bluetooth connect to the receiver in the family area and boahlah... now I can watch a movie in the patio with amazing sound coming from the loud speakers. The Taotronics device has been sitting outside for about 2 yrs and operates perfectly like the first day. I’m extremely impressed that has survived outside weather for so long with zero issues. To be clear it’s in a roof covered area behind the tv so it doesn’t get wet but has resisted the extremely humid Florida weather.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

If it rains, I merely take the radio/transmitter/cradle assembly off of the mount and stow it in a saddlebag.  It easily paired to the 20S.

"I got this because I have to listen to audio as part of my job, and have been spoiled by wireless headphones and didn't want to be tied to my desk. My computer does not have Bluetooth.  The instructions that came with were too small for my old eyes to read, but there are several reviews that walk through pairing perfectly! **MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT NEAR ANY OTHER BLUETOOTH DEVICES WHEN TRYING TO PAIR** I had on my Apple Watch and my iPhone next to me that prevented any pairing, but once I walked away from those it was easy. They paired easily to my MPOW headphones and work great - no delay or degradation of sound and they connect automatically when I turn on. I was able to pair with my Apple Airpods after a few failed attempts.  The biggest negative is that you only have the blinking lights to know if paired or unpaired. I did not take away any stars for that since it should have been my own common sense to know that. The battery charge lasts at least 6 hours, but I haven't used for longer.

"UPDATE: After contacting the seller, I was sent a replacement and the replacement worked a bit better in that the connection wan't unstable. I messed with the sound settings in my projector some more and was reach audio levels that I was satisfied with.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I wanted to connect my projector to my soundbar via bluetooth and used this to do so. It works okay for what it's worth. When I was trying to pair it to the soundbar, it kept pairing with other devices that weren't the soundbar despite having it next the soundbar. After a few attempts, I was able to pair them. Two things I noticed while using it: firstly, the connection randomly becomes unstable and it reaches the point of no longer transmitting sound. Turning it off and on usually fixes the issue but it is annoying to have to do it while a couple of times while watching a movie. Secondly, and this is the bigger issue, the sound it transmits is noticeably quieter. I did a comparison where I connect to my phone via bluetooth to my soundbar first and then connected the transmitter to the soundbar and plugged it to my phone. Transmitter to soundbar to was definitely quieter than phone to soundbar. This has been an issue when I watch movies because I've had to turn up the soundbar to its max to hear the movie and even then, it's hard to hear the quiet scenes. If you don't mind these issues, it's a decent transmitter but I'll probably switch to a different one.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0

"This was a great option to adding a sound bar to my tv via Bluetooth. It is easy to set up but I wish the cable that comes with it was a few inches longer since the tv plugs are in the back and it is quite difficult to reach each time the device is off or disconnected. It also would help if the transmitter would not disconnect when the tv is turned off since every time I turn on the tv I have to pair it again.

Bought this for my wife so she could watch/listen to the TV as loud as she wanted while I slept. It worked and paired with the headphones immediately. Would definitely recommend. Glad I went with this rather than the wired versions of TV headphones. I will say that every one in a while (rarely) you will hear some crackling.

"My wife and I like to watch TV together but I have to turn the volume up too high for her.  I tried to solve this problem using the TaoTronics Bluetooth transmitter to stream the TV audio to my Linx Quatro hearing aids via a ReSound Unite Phone Clip. Although this procedure produced good quality audio, there were two major problems. First, there was a lip-synch problem even when the TV speakers were turned off. Secondly, when my wife turned up the TV speakers to also listen to the program, I could hear a disturbing echo. Both of these problems are apparently due to a ""latency"" issue that is discussed in the product's instruction manual/user guide. I suggest before buying this product, contact customer service to make sure the Blue Tooth device (headphones/speaker) you are using is actually compatible with the product's ""low-latency"" properties. None of my blue tooth headphones, nor my hearing aids were compatible, so I had to return the product.

The pairing process itself isn’t bad. Connect the Bluetooth transmitter to your iPod or MP3 player, then power on the device, it will flash blue and red. Ensure it’s set to transmit or TX on the Bluetooth transmitter. For the AirPods you have to hold down the small white button on the back of the AirPod case while the lid is open. Keep the AirPods in the case next to the transmitter during the pairing process until the transmitter shows solid blue light.

Not the greatest setup for HD video quality content because of the analog RCA signal, but it works. The audio sound decent with RCA, but definitely not for audiophile. What is nice about this is the fact it came with a 3.5mm Female to 2 RCA Male Cable. It also works great with making 3.5 mm apple earbuds into bluetooth headphones.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0

The host connected his iPhone to the mixing board to play some music during a break. I asked if the board was Bluetooth enabled. He said no & showed me this little gadget - A TaoTronics Bluetooth transceiver - & told me that with two of them, he could pretty much Bluetooth enable anything!  I now have four of them - one in my car, which allows me to Bluetooth my phone into the car’s sound system - one to Bluetooth my Amazon Echo Dot into my downstairs sound system - and two to connect my digital recorder into my mixer.

"Extremely easy to use in both pairing and use. It functions better than I hoped. The only thing I notice while watching movies or TV shows, is that during really quiet scenes with no dialog it seems to cut out sound. During a dramatic scene you can hear the background music (usually violins) cut in and out. It might be due to the fact that I listen at very low volumes and it just doesn't detect the signal, but since it's only during quiet moments and there isn't much to hear anyway I don't care much.",5,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0

My wife and I each have a headset and the transmitter is synced with both!  In addition, since it is battery powered, I plugged the USB cable into our DVR and the device is always ready to go!

"Using it mostly in RX mode. I have need to use it over distance so I can't say much about usable range. Pros: - works well - pairs easily and stays connected - good sound - latency is conveniently low (didn't try it with sync'ed video though) Cons: - Seems that it doesn't have an auto off feature when not paired for a long time. So leaving it on usually means finding it drained next time you need it. - To make things worse, low-battery is indicated by a very intrusive and frequent interruption of audio by an alert tone. This makes it practically unusable as soon as the battery is low even if it still has some life in it. - Operation of the power button and status LED (single blue/red) isn't intuitive at all, I can't seem to memorize it.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,1

I planned on installing this on the backside of a TV to broadcast the audio to my speakers.  I wanted to plug the usb charger cable into the usb service port on the TV so I would never have to worry about battery life however that creates a ground loop which results in a high pitched noise coming through with the audio.  Tested the same setup with my laptop and it had the same issue.  No problems leaving the unit plugged in to a regular wall outlet though so not a showstopper.",4,1,2018-10-19,1,0,0

I could have upgraded them to try to match the AKGs' sound quality, but I'd have had to spend north of $100.This gizmo solved my problem, and more. Most importantly, sound quality is excellent, so I didn't have to mothball the AKGs. And the functionality is awesome. It just works. Connection, to 2 devices simultaneously, is almost instantaneous.

There is a minor inconvenience and that is that it loses connection overnight.

It's simple enough for my four-year-old to reconnect to watch TV in the mornings. I tried others and they didn't work or the bluetooth connectivity was too complicated.

"Did have some issues with this product, though customer service reached out n' helped. ^-^It'll work well as a middle ground between a Oculus Quest and a Bluetooth Reciever(Line-in port) to a PC, though be mindful of the Low Frequency you'll need to have the Quest volume fairly high to pick up everything. Other than that there might be a lil' bit of a interference buzz with subtle noises.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"During these days of lockdown, my wife brought up the fact that some friends had headphones hat connected to their televisions and couldn’t I do the same (hint - hint). I already had a set of Bluetooth headphones so I researched how to connect it to our recent model Sony (with Bluetooth) but couldn’t get them to pair. I ordered these based on their ratings and advertised low latency and ability to charge while using. Amazon shipped them quickly and they work as advertised.

However, the APEX has a volume control on the unit, and other buttons to advance songs and pause.  The TaoTronics only has a pause button.  The APEX also has a convenient clip to attach the unit to a seat belt or shirt/jacket.  I actually prefer the TaoTronics unit because of the great sound quality.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"This was easy to pair with my outdoor speakers for an outdoor movie night on my projector. You can connect two devices to it, but it did take me a minute to get both of them to connect. With my projector, I ended up only using one device though, as there was a lag on one speaker (but I believe that was due to the speaker, not this). I did end up returning as I realized I needed to upgrade to the one that allows further distance since we are using it outdoors. I do wish it had a volume control option.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"Excellent little transmitter!Works well with AirPod Pro, just have to remember to turn off Bluetooth on phone before pairing with transmitter. Also, since we have surround sound, we just connected the transmitter to the headphone jack to have Bluetooth on the receiver.

"I used this on my work laptop so I could connect my ear pods to it.  Unit sets up pretty easily and sound quality and range are good enough (not superb) but one frustration is if you walk out of range and lose the signal it does not simply pick back up, you need to go back through the pairing process.  It is very small and the USB charger with the 5MM earphone jack makes it very convenient to plug both in and always have power (shown in photo).",4,1,2020-5-29,1,0,1

The next time I used the same hook up method I had problems getting the device to work.I contacted the company, was sent a new device which I received in two short days.

Have purchased several of these devices to add Bluetooth capability to sound bars and speaker systems.  Great capability in a small package at a reasonable price.  The device is straight-forward to connect and pair.  Sound quality is good in that it appears to transmit or receive on par with the source.  Battery life is acceptable initially but battery is not user replaceable so tends to degrade to being a strictly USB-powered device after a year or so.,4,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"Initially I was skeptical if I could connect two wireless headphones to the TaoTronics Transmitter. The reason was that neither this transimtter nor my headphones have any screen to let me choose which device to connect to (unlike my iPhone).

"Nice compact Bluetooth transmitter.  Was surprise at its size, it's about 1/3 of the size of a pack of gum.  It comes with both RCA and 3.5mm cable, as well as the USB charging cable.  I'm using it to watch Netflix and etc with S.O. during flight and at home, its size again it's a major plus, allowing us to carry it everywhere.  Ability to charging and using it simultaneously is handy especially with a portable charger.However, minus one star because sometimes it takes a while to pair new headsets, in occasion more than a few tries.",4,1,2018-6-9,1,0,0
I love this item I bought two very high-end televisions unfortunately it wasn’t until next model year that Bluetooth was offered an attempt not to offend my neighbors I purchased this unit I found the instructions to install them vague however a two minute YouTube video did the trick. I bought three units however if you have more than one television and wish to use your headphones with it or any other non-Bluetooth device you really only need one with extra cables because it’s that easy to bring from one TV to the other,5,1,2018-11-21,1,0,0
"I am using this as a receiver for some noise-muffling headphones that I wear while using my power equipment. The battery lasts a while but not really a long as I would like. It seems to pair easily. I had tried to use it with a musical instrument as a transmitter to a bluetooth speaker system, but the latency/ delay between the two was just unworkable.

I have thought about buying another one, but I am concerned that it would also have the same problem and lose its bluetooth connectivity.After I wrote the above review, I was contacted by their customer support team.

Charged it up and connected it via a headphone jack converter and connected it to a DOSS speaker/receiver.  The sound good, but not as full as expected.  However, it will work well to meet my needs.

"This has worked super well with various pairs of headphones. I use it to listen to music on computers that don't have Bluetooth so that I can spare my phone battery, and I've used it to pair with speakers in the past as well. There is a high pitched whine as it approaches a full charge if I am using it with Bluetooth at the same time, presumably due to some interference in the sensitive transmit circuit, but for the price and ease of use I can live with not charging and using at the same time. Plus, the latency is unnoticeable (in my experience).",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I just received the transmitter yesterday and I have yet to try it out more intensely, but so far the transmitter does what it promises.

Would probably work fine if you are just listening passively to music.UPDATE: 3/13/2019 - The seller contacted me and went above & beyond to fix the problem.

She was very sensitive to sounds as she had come home from the hospital at 4mos old (since she was born prematurely) and wasn't adjusted to the sounds of a tv. Thus, they synced seamlessly with my headphones (although sometimes it was tricky to flip my headphones back and forth with my phone and this device). The sound quality was better than that of my tv. And thus far I haven't had any issues or glitches- 7 months later. I'd highly recommend!

"I was surprised at how tiny this dongle is! Took several attempts to connect my non-Bluetooth TV with my Bluetooth earbuds, but eventually I was able to successfully pair them.... The sound is good—clear and  consistent, but I wish i could make it even louder. (May be an earbuds issue.).... I did have to go into my TV sound settings to adjust the delay so what I heard matched speakers’ lips.... There are two minor glitches.  One is that I cannot have the adapter plugged in to recharge it when I am using it to transmit a Bluetooth signal.  The second is that I have to enter my TV sound settings and switch to “external speaker” when I use the adapter.  Otherwise I have both TV speaker sound and Bluetooth, which some people may actually like.

"What I bought this for was to connect my bluetooth earbuds to my amp so I could play guitar without any wires. Yet the latency is about ~0.4 of a second off, which makes it hard to play and kind of ruined the purpose I bought this for. I tried using it with the ps4 on Netflix to see how bad the latency was on there and it was pretty bad, you have to be like less than 2 feet away from your controller/transmitter or you can see ~0.4 sec latency between audio and movement. Another major problem, which I don't know why they did this but when you listen to anything and there is a part that is very quiet the sound fades out, which is super distracting. Overall I would only recommend this product for audio only listeners as long as you like your music loud otherwise like I said it will fade out. Those are the main issues I've had so far with this device. I will not be sending it back because I'm sure I'll have a use for this sometime down the line.",2,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

Also my Scullcandy Uproar Bluetooth headphones. I did have to reset the headphones back to factory which was easy. Sound quality I cannot complain.",4,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"This was really difficult to pair with a Bose QC30 noise cancelling headset, but after messing with it for about 30 min I finally was successful.  Just took repeated tried - not sure what finally made it connect.  Since then, it connects with my headset every time, and I haven't had to do this initial pairing routine again.I purchased this specifically so I could watch movies on air flights and get the audio to my BOSE BT headset.  It's nice that it can charge via USB while using, but the volume is so low, compared to just plugging in some ear buds, that I finally have resorted to using regular ear buds, and not my noise cancelling headset while watching movies on flights.  I just couldn't hear the softer volume parts of the movies.  I know it's not a Bose issue in this case, as when I bluetooth from other devices, like my Samsung 9+ phone, for music or movies the volume through the headset is very loud.",3,1,2019-2-12,1,1,0

"I purchased this device for two reasons.  First, I wanted something that I could use in an airplane to watch movies with bluetooth headphones.  Second, I wanted my wife and I to be able to listen to the same audio at the same time.  I haven't tested this device in a plane yet, but I tried with an old Discman CD player and everything worked great.  We connected my Panasonic headphones and my wife's Jabra earbuds at the same time with no problems!  I will try these on a plane soon.  I will update this review if I have any issues.

"This Transmitter/Receiver works great in terms of connecting with my Bluetooth headphones. It connects quickly, easily, and the connection was steady and never wavered. Unfortunately, I started having issues with streaming live TV and movies, and my Roku was saying I had a poor/non-existent internet connection the past 2 days. I unplugged and restarted both my Roku and my modem/router so many times to no avail. But as soon as I unplugged and turned off the receiver, I stopped having issues. It was a waste of $30, but maybe I can find somebody else who can find some use in it, and I'll have to try and find a different receiver/transmitter that doesn't affect WiFi.",3,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0

It didn’t work for me. The tv I wanted to use it on apparently doesn’t have audio output ports and no headphone port. I did try it on a different tv with a headphone port.

So far, there have been no problems with audio and visuals being out of sync. Sound is clear, and perfect for me.Setup was a little confusing as the tiny instruction booklet doesnt make it clear which setting is best for what devices. I found that my bluetooth headphones worked best with TX. Also the red and white a/v cables weren't necessary for my TV, I just use the 35mm audio Jack connector, and plugged it right in between the adapter and the TV. To setup/connect each time you need to be within 3ft of the device, but after that you can move further away. I would say I've been about 10 ft away, with no problems.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0

It worked OK while it worked. There was too much lag for my taste, and the audio quality was average. The volume levels were OK, but probably would be best paired with an amplifier...so why not just buy a bluetooth adapter with a built in amp? 3 stars for 2 years of average use.",3,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
I use for my older TV's that do not have bluetooth capabilities. I use it in the TX mode for this application.

It seems the sound tracks better with the image on the screen.  It's a great product !!,5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"So it works, but there is some sort of sound output issue sometimes. If the sound output is not continuous or high enough volume, the transmitter won't send any sound.

I bought this for my '97 truck that had a 2002 radio with aux input in the front. I have to say it works great and connects to my phone with no problems. One thing I like best about it is it will turn off automatically if it is not connect to a phone. That way you are not losing power while not in use.

Latency is too much when watching video. Perfect for music!I bought this so I could watch movies on the plane with my Trekx Air Bluetooth headphones but the latency (delay) is nearly .5 to 1 second behind the video.

"Great for listening to the tv through Bluetooth headphones. I hooked up my tv to my stereo receiver via TOSlink digital optical cable.

Takes about 20 seconds to link to headphones. Works great and didn't notice any delay in watching tv.  Also hooked it up to Echo Dot because my Cowin E7 Bluetooth headphones rarely connect with Echo Dot. Bummer.  Only downside is can't use the previous next track button on anything so far. I also tried the Tao in receiver mode. I plugged my computer speakers into the Tao 3.5mm jack and linked my Fire HD 8, and it worked great too.  Like the small size.

This product met that need. I am able to connect both of my Bluetooth headsets to it and we both can listen and speak to the teacher. Setup was easy. Definitely recommend!,5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"Edit: customer service came back to me to make it work right. I am impressed they stand back so much behind their product.This unit just failed to pair for me. I am a significant Tech savvy person, and own decent pair of Bluetooth headphones like Jabra Elite 65t active and Sony WF1000 Xm3 both. No luck with either of those., tried for 1 hour, what a time waste. Please beware before making a purchase that this may happen, I am not even sure why the reviews are so good for this product.

"I used the Tao in transmit mode connected to the phone port (or the main ports) of my sound board.  A Sony WHH-H900 noise cancelling wireless stereo headset was used successfully--although it was necessary to fully charge both parts and remove a competing  nearby bluetooth device.  The previously used Sony transformer has given delayed sound from my mike system.  This unit was considerably improved, with a slight perceptible latency.  I'm happy with the result and using it regularly to overlay sounds from various sources including instrumental mikes allowing me to hear a balanced sound in my headset.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"When I bought this, I thought - hey, wirefree on airline! But this one was a disappointment. Within 2 months, the battery life has dropped to less than 10 minutes - so its useless in an airplane. Maybe I got a lemon, but sound quality has dropped too and is mediocre at best, so save your money and invest elsewhere.",1,1,2019-8-26,1,1,0
"The earbuds fit perfectly put of the box and are so light, they don't fall out. They are perfect for listening to music and are easy to control. Very nice product.I know they are not aptX low latency, but compared to two different earbuds that are, I could tell little difference between this Taotronics latency and both the Pasonomi Bluetooth 5.0 and the Apanage 5.0 which are both aptX incoded. To get no latency on stage, I find I have to use wired earbuds.  With all three, the latency is about a sixteenth note at 140 beats a minute, not enough to cause a problem with a slow ballad, but real problem with a faster song. I hope the engineers keep working on better latency products, but for now, this Taotronics is as good as it gets.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"I used the Bluetooth transmitter to connect to a TV sound bar for my spouse to hear the audio at a higher volume using earbuds . It works well except the sound in the earbud sound arrives slightly earlier than the sound bar giving her an echo effect.

I bought a 16 inch TV that had the worst sound in the world.  It was ok for my hubby because he only listens to the news and it always sounds bad...  The TV had no bluetooth and I couldn't connect it to anything.  Many speakers are output only ...I don't know why and some others produce feedback if they are connected to charge too long.  This bluetooth thingy was just what I needed to make my TV bluetoothable.  It works very well.,5,1,2018-12-1,1,0,0
I liket the product at the beginning. A couple of weeks after I got it it started not holding the charge and started turning off about 15 minutes after I started using it to watch a movie.It only stayed on if continuesly plugged to be charged - BUT while it was plugged it was also sending a humming noise to my headphones (when I unplugged the charging cable to humming sound stopped).,1,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
I’ve been using this for a couple of months as a Bluetooth connector to my television so the volume level doesn’t drive my wife crazy. Overall I like the product pretty well however I do run into issues sometime when turning it off and on.

"I love this thing. I keep different waking hours than my family, but with the bluetooth transmitter hooked up to my TV, I can watch movies or play video games without bothering anyone while they're sleeping. The only issue I have with it is if the volume is too low, it tends to cut out the sound every few seconds. But that's easily fixed by moderating the volume on my headset low while keeping it higher on the television. I never have connectivity issues and it's so easy to hook up to my headset.",5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
"Decent product. It takes a little longer to pair then I would like. I use this for my switch. I used a different Bluetooth transmitter for the switch that connected to the charge port so of you needed to charge the switch, you have to take the transmitter out. Since this one plugs into the headphone jack, it makes it more convenient to still have your Bluetooth one and charge your switch at the same time. It is a little bit but I don't mind. It's what I wanted and it does a good job. I would recommend this to everyone.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0

"I had previously purchased a version of this product with a cable that was permanently attached. TaoTronics was good enough to replace that version after it failed, but I also chose to purchase this version as it seemed sturdier.

"For a Bluetooth transmitter/receiver the TaoTronics 2-In-1 is pretty fast, but there's still too much delay for gaming and the boosted speed sacrifices too much of the audio quality, in my opinion. TaoTronics' newer one might be a little better, but it's also more expensive and I haven't tried the newer one yet so Idk.Edit: After returning this device, TaoTronics reached out to me and generously offered a newer device (the TT-BA09) for free, and I accepted the offer. While this doesn't improve the quality of the old product, it does improve my impression of TaoTronics. I've learned that modern Bluetooth technology hasn't advanced enough to have latency low enough for gaming yet, so until then I'm going to lower my standards for Bluetooth a bit and add a star to my review for the TaoTronics 2-In-1.",4,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0

This little gadget works perfect cause we plug it into speakers and use bluetooth for the phone to play music.  It is so small it tucks away perfectly under our motorcycle seat.  Set-up was easy.  Would purchase again.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
Following the instructions it connects quickly to the AirPods Pro before initial use. No problem reconnecting after that. Have used it a few times for flight entertainment and on a computer. During flight entertainment I needed to bump up the volume higher than for wired head phones but still sufficient reserve. Sound quality is good.Considering the price of the ear buds this is an inexpensive but functional device to extend utilization of the Airpods.,5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
My partner loves to watch Big Bang while I'm reading.... this saved our marriage! She can watch to her hearts content and I can sleep or read without wanting to throw the tv out the window....

Now we can use two bluetooth headsets and this unit was super easy to set up.  We watched a long movie and it worked perfectly and the battery lasted the entire time with no problem.

Works perfectly. I travel often enough for it to be worth the $$ and I’m glad I made the purchase. I get slight anxiety when flying and this combined with my noise canceling bose headphones drowns out the engine sounds to put me at ease so I can listen to music or watch movies. When I’m not flying I use it with my nintendo switch since it doesn’t support bluetooth. Works better than more expensive competitors. 5 Star Buy.,5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
I loved the idea of this but instructions how to set your TV audio not so much I spent a hour researching how to switch modes and whatever then i experimented and as soon as i switched the audio from variable to fixed it worked immediately then turned up volume via my beats audio headphones but not certain of hooking to soundbar i just did the red white RCA cables to back of TV then turned off my soundbar and tv speakers.

For someone who really isn't about the bells and whistles of a Bluetooth product like this- I absolutely love this adapter. I needed the adapter for the nights when I am staying up later than my husband- I had plugged into my controller but that was bulky and cumbersome to carry around. This has simple instructions and straightforward operation. I was able to connect to the Bluetooth adapter in under a minute and had minimal problems walking around my 2 bedroom apartment without distorted sound.

I just paired one of my BT Wireless Headphones to it and plugged it into the headphone jack on the tv.  The pairing was SO easy!  It worked exactly as the instructions explained it.  I turned it on and voila!  There was my TV audio again.  Sounds great and the latency is very low.  I also love the fact that you can charge it while you use it.So easy and so useful!  I would definitely recommend this product!,5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"Took several tries and almost gave up, but finally got two Bose wireless speakers connected.  Once speakers were connected all worked well.  Directions that came with the device are just okay. Needed to find the instructions for the device online (YouTube) to gain a better understanding of how to connect correctly.  That's why fours stars instead of five.",4,1,2019-3-31,1,0,0
"I didn't know it had volume control, I'll have to check this out, but the transmission is fine and the airpods reconnect whenever the tv goes back on. The airpods beep and then 8 seconds later, I get sound. It's not 8 seconds behind, but I've noticed thats how long it takes to connect.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"I hooked this bad boy up to my Bose speakers in my living room. Whenever I want to play music now, I don't have to physically connect to anything. I just hit ""play"" on spotify, put the phone back in my pocket and go on doing what I need to do while listening to music. It's also helpful for parties as I don't have to leave a conversation to adjust music volume and or change songs. It's also so small that you don't even notice it's there.  Battery life is very decent. I usually plug it into the usb charger every so often. You can also use it while its charging. I'd definitely recommend it hands down.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
Works great. Sound was quite loud. I haven’t figured out how to adjust the volume. It seems like whatever the TV sound is when you plug it in is the sound that you’re going to get it doesn’t allow you to control it up or down. I’m sure it has something to do with the TV but I haven’t figured it out yet.,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I use it in my kitchen so I can hear the TV while cooking because the vent hood over my stove is like a jet engine. Sometimes it has some latency. I wish there was a way to only connect one speaker instead of auto connecting both connections. It often tries to connect to another bluetooth speaker I have in the room above it, and I have to go up to turn that one off when it connects. It does the job, though. I'm happy enough with it, and I'm not tripping over an aux cord anymore.",3,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
Works pretty good the few times I tried it. Don't know how much I will use but it does work as advertised. The only bad thing I can say is that it is a little inconvenient to recharge due to the TV being pushed back against the wall. Have not tried other uses so far only the audio out from TV.,4,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
Endless pros.-Unbelievably small device that connects easily to any electronic with a headphone jack and no Bluetooth.,5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
Finally upgraded my headphones to blue tooth & the TV didn't support them. Got this & it worked perfectly with my existing audio aux adapter. Pairing can be tricky. You will need to start the process at the same time as your headphones. If it doesn't pair after a little while double click the power button to try again. It needs to be close. Can't do it from across the room (at least with my headphones).,5,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
Perfect!  This turned our TV into a smart TV!  We inserted it into our TV and paired it with a bluetooth speaker!  Now our TV isn't blasting through out the house so we can hear it!

New Updated Review:I got in touch with customer service and they have some of the best customer service. They helped me with my problem and sent me a new receiver that works so much better than the original. They made sure I was taken care of and I really appreciate their help.

"This is a nice little gadget. I purchased it hoping to connect my Zune (stop laughing) to my Kenwood car stereo via Bluetooth. The only issue was, I could not get it to pair at all. It acted like it was going to, and it showed up in my paired items list, but it would never actually connect. Returned it for this reason. It did not work for what I wanted. Would work great in other applications though.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"I have this plugged into my TV audio out so that I can listen with bluetooth headphones. There's very little latency so there are no oddities such as hearing dialog after seeing lips move or seeing a car crash and after two seconds hearing the sound of the crash!

"Works in Bluetooth receive mode going to an aux device, but couldn't get it to work in aux to Bluetooth send.It just wouldn't connect to a bluetooth receiver.

"Bought this mainly to use as a receiver in my car. To hook up Bluetooth to my phone, as my car audio system only has an Aux hookup, and no Bluetooth connectivity. While my phone no longer has a headphone jack in it.With the provided (short) cables, It easily hooks up to the ports in my center console storage, for both power and Aux. Its small enough that it barely takes up any space. And instantly hooks up to my phone once paired the first time, when switching to receiver.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0

"I use this as a receiver in the car because my phone doesn't have a headphone jack but I mostly use it for my iPod classic so it can connect to my AirPods.

"I used this adapter to connect my Bluetooth headset to the entertainment system on an airplane.  I set up the connection between the adapter and my headphone ahead of my flight so that I wasn't in a rush.  There were no issues pairing with my Sony head set.  The battery life is longer than my headset, so I just charge them both at the same time.There is a slight delay in audio, but I consider it acceptable for use while on the plane. Most of my time was spent listening to music instead of watching videos, so I didn't have any issues with the delay.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
I use these to transmit the audio from the inflight entertainment systems to my Bose bluetooth headphones.  Using the wire to connect my headphones to the system leaves the wire dangling and catching on the tray table.  The TaoTronics dongle allows me to do without the wire.  There is no lag between the picture and sound and I can even get up and walk around and the bluetooth connection will not break.,5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"I've used this both to transmit and receive Bluetooth.  My TV sound system has a headphone jack, but it's on the other side of the room. With this gizmo i can use my favorite Bluetooth headphones and nobody cares.  As a receiver, i have used it with a nice wired pair of headphones.  Works fine but doesn't seem like an option for me to use very often.Build quaity is good. Looks like it will last for along time.",4,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
Bought this transmitter to pair with my TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 earsbuds. They paired easily and sound great but I can't control the volume level from the earbuds to the TV or control the volume with the TV controller. Thus the 1 star for volume control. Update - found out my older smart tv is not compatible with the transmitter to control the volume.,4,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"The product headline has a significant falsehood - this is not even close to low latency. In fact, I would estimate the latency to be about 1/3 to 1/2 second delay. I bought this product to transmit from my electric keyboard to a bluetooth receiver (headphones or speaker). After getting it charged up and paired, I eagerly tried playing, and was shocked at the significant delay between when I press a key on the keyboard and when the sound comes out almost a half second later. It's completely unusable.If you were trying to connect the audio portion of a video to a bluetooth speaker, you should expect the audio and video to be out of sync.",1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,1
"I purchased this to connect with my Bose Sound Bar in my RV.  After charging it and connecting it to a portable CD player It was ready for use.

I have a TCL television and its biggest negative to me is that it isn't able to connect to any other bluetooth device except the specific TCL soundbar. So I did some research and found this transmitter and ordered it immediately. The transmitter was relatively easy to set up and connect to after reading the manual. I had just plugged it into the 3.5mm audio jack on the back on my television and was able to connect it via bluetooth to a different 3rd party soundbar that I had. Another great feature that I enjoy is that it will reconnect to the same device if you happen to turn off the speaker or television.

I jacked TaoTronics wireless device into the radio's auxiliary output and now mostly listen to radio and cds over either TaoTronics Soundsurge 60 headphones or over a Big Blue speaker I can position as far from the common wall as I like.  The sound quality may not be as good as Bose, but it's decent enough and especially with the headphones, I get background noise-cancelling as well.  I've already recommended the device to friends.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0

I'm 81 years old and have been married to the same women for 61 years. This is important we don't fight over the TV being too loud. I want to keep her for another 61 years because I don't want to train another. I have 7 TV'S and I have a Taotronics transmitter on five of them. The most important thing that is a must is that there is no delay in the words that you hear over the speaker. I have hearing aids but like the transmitters better when watching TV. Headphones are too hot and heaver when you are watching a game. So easy to install. Service is the greatness. Enjoy I do,5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
Its not so easy to pair with the earphones. I have taotronic ear phones and it takes 3 or 4 times to turno on and off both devices to get it paired.After 1 year of my review I received a mail from customer service and give me a refund because of my problems.

I like this particularly since it includes the AUX cable and correct RCA adapter for this to work with a TV.

"This gadget is perfect. I use it for my outside spa on the tv I have out there. I plug into that tv to broadcast its sound via Bluetooth to my wireless Bluetooth headphones. I use these gadgets because when the spa jets are full blast, I can’t hear the TV’s built in speakers. The quality of transmission is perfect, the battery life is great, and it easily and quickly recharges. My only regret is I wish I had found this transmitter sooner.",5,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
"This small device packs a powerful punch. I use it to wirelessly play music on my Roku TV from my iPhone or iPad. I thought I would have to learn how to use it, but it pairs easily with all of my devices and the sound quality is awesome. By awesome sound, I mean, clarity, bass and vocals are crisp and clear.

"Not sure if I received a model that was defective but sometimes I’m getting sound delay at night and no delay during the day. Base on the reviews, I’m going to assume I have a defective device BUT that did not stop me from purchasing a new unit. I’ve gone through several hours without charging. Battery life is excellent. Device is super small and light. Overall, good product for the price!",5,1,2019-2-11,1,0,0
"I love the sound and also the quality.

"Was fast n easy to connect on my computer via 3.5mm jack. 20 seconds total. But am disappointed with latency in videos.....seems like maybe 0.5 seconds latency vs video.

This device works as advertised. We use it in our RV. Our TV does not have a speaker system and due to an A/C located between the TV and where we set it is hard to control the volume. We hooked this transmitter up to a Bluetooth speaker between the seats where we set and problem solved. Easy to set up if u follow the instruction. Good quality and sound. Great price.

This is a great solution for the old TV my wife and I have that doesn't have Bluetooth. We are getting older and having the ability to connect a headset to the TV wireless is awesome.

"I ordered this because I wanted to Bluetooth my mic to my Nintendo switch. Unfortunately with this having a send and receive switch, it can only either play the sound or let me use my mic, not both.This isn't the products fault though so I'm still giving it 5 stars because for connecting with Bluetooth headphones it does work. Just be aware it's not good for gaming.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
The problem is layency / delay. There is a solid 1-2 second delay even when only 1 foot away from the earbuds.

Works fine but I like to leave my bluetooth adapters on (and on a 5v wall wart) for remote use but this unit shuts off automatically after some (several minutes) of dormancy .... so you have to press the mate button to wake it up each time you use it.

"Just got this device today, been using it for the past couple hours. A tip that may be common sense, but took a minute for me to figure out. If you have digital or satellite television, connect the device to the cable box A/V ports and “not” your televisions A/V ports. Besides that, setup was simple once I got through the instructions.Only con is the volume, there is no volume control on the device, so you control volume with your headphones in my case. It’s not loud enough for me (may be my headphones), but I’ll try another pair and see what the results.",4,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"It works well. I use it to hook up my blue tooth ear phones to the bedroom TV. ( my husband says thanks! He does not watch late night tv). I reduced one star because it was difficult to get everything working. Our daughter helped, but it even took her a little bit.",4,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

Works and connects to my Beats solo3 Bluetooth headphones. My hearing is poor. I bought this to replace old Sony over the ear wireless headphones. I did not realize my Panasonic Plasma TV only has optical audio out. I plugged the sound wire to audio out on the cable box. OK but no sound with the Roku stick.  Should have bought the optical compatible model. Also I had no USB ports to charge. Used old iPhone charger  plug for USB.  I don’t use the ROKU on this TV so I will keep this.,5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0

I bought a pair of these low latency aptX model receivers/transmitters (TT-BA07).  I connected the audio out of my projector with one in Transmitter mode and the second in Receiver mode to my stereo receiver.

I have ordered 6 of these over the past 2 years.  They work perfect.  Mostly I have set up 2 speakers for hard to hear elderly.  They love the fact that each person gets to control their own volume or take one in the kitchen while they are working. I’m a big fan of TaoTronics and have purchase several electronic items from them. They all work great.  From a led light to noise canceling headphones.  All items look great and work great.,5,1,2018-8-25,1,0,0
Volume can not go very high regardless of how high it is set at. The lag time is noticable but not that big of a deal since it's only a few seconds if that. Connecting it to your Bluetooth speaker or headphones can be a pain at first but after the first time it's easy. The charge life for it definitely needs improvement. You get maybe 4 hours before having to charge it again but a plus is it can be used while charging. All in all it does what I bought it for and the price was not that bad especially since some of the other ones on the market have the same issues but you pay double for them.,4,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

Bought this after having really good experience with TaoTronics' bluetooth headphones and soundbar for my TV.

So far I've been very impressed with TaoTronics' products and this is no exception.,5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
Purchased this product hoping it would allow me to practice the guitar with wireless headphones. Unfortunately there is a several millisecond delay rendering this device useless for any live application or where playback is synced. Sound quality seemed fine but I couldn't stand playing with the delay for more than about 3 minutes so I have no idea how the battery life is. It was easy to get the headphones connected.UPDATE based on this review the seller contacted me to issue a refund. The delay i experienced is typical of any Bluetooth product.  They said with low latency compatible headphones the delay might be as short as 7 to 10 ms.  The device has found a home converting one of my old stereos to be now Bluetooth capable.

Plugged it in my old ihome speaker that doesn't have connection app available anymore. After a quick 5 minute setup we had music playing. Worked great. Luckily the speaker had a usb outlet that the Bluetooth could charge off of. Otherwise it would have to be plugged into an outlet. Only downside is the length of cord. Too short for us because we need to access the Bluetooth receiver if it turns off and it's not easily accessible since cord is so short and it sits behind speaker on a shelf.

It take a little time to connect some bluetooth devices however some of them connect very quick. It also have some sound delay and the reach is no more then 10ft.

A bit cumbersome explanation, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. Not something I would recommend when none to minimum lag is expected.

"Patience is a requirement for pairing Beats headphones to this transmitter.  Make sure all other wireless devices are very far away or completely powered down.  Make sure both the headphones and the transmitter are fully charged.  Turn on the Beats headphones, they should automatically blink to pair.  Turn on the transmitter in TX mode.  The headphones may go through a power down if paring does not occur on the first attempt.  Should that happen, power down the transmitter and toggle to RX mode.  Repeat a pairing attempt for a whole headphone pairing cycle in RX mode, until power down.  Turn off the transmitter and toggle back to TX mode.

Only complaint I have is that when the device is charging there is a very high pitch tone that can be heard (not loud).

My intent was to get rid of cabled headphones.  The sound was fine and pairing was easy enough (once I moved other bluetooth sources like iPhones away from the transmitter).  The problem was that there was about a 1 second lag between the sound I was playing on my guitar and the time it hit my ears.  This would not be a problem at all if you are just using it to play back music from a source but it made it impossible to use in my situation.  I gave it 1 star for sound quality specifically for that - otherwise the sound quality was fine.,3,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0

Great sound quality and easy to set up. I bought three and paired two receivers with one transmitter.  Works as promised. Limited range though. User manual says 33’ but it’s more like 20’ and once you walk out of range they do not automatically reconnect when you walk back in range. Manual says working battery life is 10 hours. I tested this after fully charging them and it’s more like 8 hours but that’s still impressive. They are very small and lightweight which is what I wanted.

Warning. This device is not a Bluetooth aptx low latency receiver. The description is misleading. I have an aptx low latency transmitter which indicates the mode of transmission. When this device is connected it does not indicate low latency.  I’m not sure if it can transmit aptx low latency codec as I didn’t test that.  If you plan on using this device as a receiver you will encounter laggy audio and unacceptable lip sync.  Bummed out.,1,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0

"UPDATED REVIEW - my initial review was 2-starts because I could rarely get the transmitter to synch. I posted my review and within a couple of days received a letter from the seller stating that they wanted to verify my address so they could send me a new transmitter. I received it a couple of weeks later and tried it out. It worked perfectly. I charged it, plugged it in to my 'headphones' jack on my laptop and it synched up immediately with my Phaser BT earbuds. I plugged it into the aux spkr out jack on my television and it synched up with my headphones immedately. No problems. Sound quality is good and there is no 'latency' - or delay. I have a 2400 sq ft home with the tv pretty much in the middle of the home and I can listen to my music or programs while walking throughout the house without any loss of signal. I'm happy with this transmitter. KUDOS to the folks at SunValley (sellers) for their excellent pursuit of making the customer happy. They contacted me based on my initial Amazon review, sent me a new unit, contacted me again as to whether or not I received it and wanted to know about it's performance. Good job on supporting the customer.",5,1,2018-4-26,1,1,0

"This device paired effortlessly with my Bose AE2w bluetooth headphones. I bought 2 of these TaoTonics transceivers - one for an immediate purpose, and the other for “I'll think of something.“ I have a pocket-sized portable SDR receiver for AM/FM, short-wave, and HF ham bands, that I wanted to use with my headphones, but without the hassle of using a cord. A small piece of double-sided tape was all it took to stick this bluetooth unit onto the receiver, next to the receiver's earphone jack. I set the TaoTronics to TX, and paired it with the headphones. A few seconds later, I was set. At the office, I usually listen to MP3s or audiobooks, from my android phone or tablet.

"Like all small and inexpensive Bluetooth units it is difficult to determine what it is paired with, but if you either reset it or move it out of range of your other Bluetooth units it pairs fairly easy. I really like it for what it use it for, so much so that I have two of them. I have not tried to pair them with each other while one was in RX and the other was in TX but I feel sure that if I eliminate other Bluetooth units in the area it will work fine. If only I could get them to pair with my hearing aids I would be ecstatic.",4,1,2018-4-29,1,1,0

"Worked great for two months for getting my extra monitor+Roku (""TV"") sound to my speakers. Just a hint of delay, which was fine for my purposes of background TV. Then, I accidentally unplugged it at some point and tlater inadvertently used it until it was dead. It still turned off on me after plugging it back in and waiting 10 min. It appears unable to charge and transmit at the same time. I wish it were able to use the electricity coming in to just run and then charge when nothing is needed, especially since I typically leave it plugged in always. I ended up setting up a hardwire connection, so I haven't check if it ever worked again.All in all, it's a good, easy to use device if you are careful to keep it plugged it in.",4,1,2018-4-26,1,0,0

"This works nice as a Bluetooth transmitter for music or other audio only applications (old stereos, old record players, ect..).  But if you are trying to use this to transmit audio from a TV where you need the audio to Sync with the video, this will not do that.  There is about a 1/2 second delay so the lips on the tv video don't match the sound you hear on the remote speaker.  I tried this with two speaks and both had delays, one worst than the other. I also tried it with a new set of bluetooth headset and it worked much better but still had a slight delay.  So if your just looking to send sound to a remote bluetooth speaker this works great but if you need it to sync with video (a remote speaker for a tv) then you should look elsewhere.I did contact their tech support and they were great not wasting my time they told me upfront that there would be a Sync Delay for TV with this device.",4,1,2018-7-6,1,2,0

I bought 6 of these and left in the car. All 6 batteries swelled and cause side of transmitter to bulge out. They said temperatures near 100 degrees was excessive temperature.

"This protective weather resistant case from Taotronics makes travel with your 13"" laptop easier and safer.They spared no effort to bring you a great looking neoprene material that is lightweight and durable in black and white.

Water seems to roll over the sleeve and not get absorbed. So it seems to be some spill resistance.  The handle makes this very portable.

"Edit: The supplier reached out to me and has sent me a new device. This new one has NO static. The quality is as clear as me using the bluetooth straight from my cellphone. I can't even tell I'm using bluetooth with my desktop.This product does what it is supposed to, but the static while being a transceiver is atrocious. I bought this as a gift for my husband to use with his Bluetooth ear phones (Trekz Aftershokz Titanium) and his computer (Win7, all updated).

"Let me tell  you, watching TV at night with the whole household sleeping has just become way easier (and cooler). Most definitely I am impressed with this little toy. It is very easy and straight forward in operation.  I have not had any issues pairing it with several of my bluetooth headsets. The transmitter allows pairing up to two devices at a time and this is a life-saver function. Real-life example: you and your wife want to watch some TV with the baby sleeping in the room next to you. You pair up two sets of wireless headphones and you each wear a pair and control your sound volume individually as it suits you through your own headset (headsets are obviously not included with this transmitter/receiver). No more sharing one pair of earbuds and fighting with ""TV should be louder"" or ""Are you deaf... turn it down"" (don't get me wrong, the 21st century's version of the famous cartoon's ""Lady and a Tramp"" moment may add a little romance to your marriage... you know, the one where they share a noodle... except that in this case instead of the noodle there is a earbud chord going from your ear to hers... you catch the drift...).But on a serious note - this is a good product, easy to set up and delivers pretty descent sound. Battery life, unfortunately, could be a little longer. I set it to charge every night, even though I am not using it on daily basis.",5,0,2018-11-21,1,1,0
"I have a Victrola 8-in-1 that has Bluetooth in but no Bluetooth out.  I wanted to pair it with my home stereo in one room and a Soundbar setup in another room.  With this Bluetooth Transmitter/ Receiver, I was able use it in Transmitter mode to pair with both systems.  I can now have either one or both on and have the audio out as provided by the headphones jack on my Victrola playing in either or both rooms.Some people have complained about pairing and especially pairing to two devices.  My suggestion is follow the directions closely and when you try to pair to the second device, have the first device turned off during the pairing.  Once paired to the second device, turn the first one back on to have both working.",5,0,2019-5-20,1,0,1
"I needed this adapter to connect two bluetooth headphones simultaneously to one device for work. This adapter works well for connecting one headphone but it is very temperamental when trying to connect two headphones at the same time.  I only got it to connect to two headphones simultaneously one time out of dozens of attempts.  As soon as I turned the adapter off and back on, I was forced to start the process all over again and had no more luck.

"Got this to send audio from the steam streamer TV doodad, a Playstation TV, and a DIY android TV box that connect to a projector - to a soundbar that is under the projector screen. I have a lot of devices that do half of what this one does, receive bluetooth to make a car or stereo or whatever become a bluetooth speaker. This one can do that, too, but it also can turn something that doesn't have bluetooth output (like a walkman, dvd player, musical instrument) into a bluetooth device that can connect to bluetooth speakers.Just think, with two of these you can make everything bluetooth! your gameboy and your old boombox!

"There are different types of sleeves and cases available for electronic devices. This is one of my favorites. It is made of neoprene and is waterproof. Having a waterproof case helps put my mind at ease because there is always the possibility of something being accidentally spilled. The inside is like a pillow for your device. It is padded with small cushiony circles. It is very roomy. I put different devices in it, like my iPad Pro 12.9 and a Chromebook. Each device easily fit into the case with room to spare. The outside has pockets available to safely store all of your accessories. This case is amazing! For me, the icing on the cake are the handles. Because of the handles, there is no need to insert the case in a separate bag. It can safely and securely be carried by itself. If you don't need the handles, they can easily be tucked away so they are completely out of sight. If you need a case, and want something affordable that offers a maximum level of protection, look no further. This is the case for you!",5,0,2017-6-23,1,1,1

Going to test them out at the gym as well- no more running on the mill with wires slapping me on the face!In terms of sound quality, I'm no audiophile, but i do produce music on Ableton, there does seem to be a little static when it hits the lows, mids and highs relatively sound good.",4,0,2019-9-28,1,0,0

I love it. With the Bluetooth connection, it is much better because I get the audible signal right into the speaker in my helmet, so I am not always looking at the visual alert. Much more relaxing.",5,0,2018-10-6,1,1,0
This case is really nice. It is small and portable and makes for a good carrying case. The reason I like this case is that it has handles on it!! It also has a small compartment to hold your charger. Be warned tho that it will bulge out of your case if you have a thicker charging brick. Overall this case is great for traveling. You no longer have to carry the laptop in your arms and have too much to carry. The smaller compartment makes it so that you also no longer have to worry about carrying your charger in another container. It also may have enough room for you to put in a battery pack  and charging cable! (battery size varies). The interior design is fairly unique it has a lot of bumpers inside to make sure that the laptop is shock resistant and the exterior makes it so that you no longer have to worry about any scratches or dents that may occur if you run into something. The handles are very thin and flexible so if you wish to put this case inside your backpack that is possible however be aware compared to other cases this is a little bigger to accommodate the smaller pocket. The zippers are definitely very sturdy so your do not have to worry about any of them breaking!! Overall I really enjoy this product and highly recommend it!,5,0,2017-4-13,1,0,0

Worst case I will have to talk to my audiologist.,5,1,2019-9-19,1,1,0
"I was looking for an easy way to watch TV with my wireless headphones without having to buy an expensive set of headphones. I love the fact that this allows me to connect two sets of headphones simultaneously! Now that's a plus. The sound quality will depend on your television settings and type of headphones. Connecting was so easy. It also runs on battery power that it stores when plugged into your TV's USB port so you can take it wherever you go without having to worry about having a power source. I can get 6 hours of playtime on battery and forever when the USB is plugged in. I highly recommend for home or on the go. I never lost connection, even around corners and behind walls.",4,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"Took a little bit to pair at first, finally I put my head phones right next to this transmitter and it snapped it right up! Took about 5 to 10 minutes. Now there is no problem pairing now, works perfectly. Used this to connect my tablet to my head phones for music, really like getting rid of the wires, less wires the better! Now if they can wirelessly power something about a foot or two away, that would be wild! lol Will definitely buy everything with Bluetooth on it in future, get tired of getting up to plug transmitter in and out on the Tv to listen to the speakers on the Tv or headset, one or the other.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

"This Protective Sleeve from TaoTronics (designed mainly for 13"") gives an added piece of mind when transporting or storing your unit. The sleeve itself is lightweight yet seems very durable. The sleeve actually came with a storage bag also which I probably won't use. This is made of outer shell neoprene (which will resist liquid spills) and a very soft inner shell which will not scratch or damage your laptop. The zipper seems top of the line and moves freely, the pulls have the TT logo. I am super impressed with this sleeve for the cost of the added protection!!!!!!",5,0,2017-4-6,1,0,0

My old Jabra wouldn't pair at all) and away you go.  I thought all sound would come through the transmitter, but it doesn't, so I had to turn the volume down on my TV, but now that I know, it's not an issue.

I found the TaoTronics 5.0 Transmitter/Receiver device at a very reasonable price and decided to give it a go. It was very easy to pair and set up, working seamlessly with my TV. I would however recommend using a longer audio cable at least 1 meter in length, so that the transmitter device is in front of the TV rather than behind it. TaoTronics supply a very short audio cable with the device which places the receiver behind the TV resulting in loss of synchronisation sometimes with spoken dialogue.

I've found that using a longer 3.5mm stereo cable to connect the transmitter to the TV headphone socket works better than the short one provided with the product, the short cable results in the transmitter having to sit slightly behind my TV, which does result in a little bit of lag, the longer cable, however, means the transmitter can sit on top of my entertainment unit, and in that position it works lag free over a distance of about 4 metres to where I'm sitting.",5,1,2018-8-22,0,1,0
I bought this to be able to listen to my TV via Bluetooth headphones. My plasma Television doesn’t have a sound outlet to attach any Bluetooth transmitter so my set up is a little complicated to do it but this device seperates the sound from the HDMI cable coming out of the TV ( or Media Box ) and I could use a Bluetooth transmitter via a 3.5 plug into it to get sound sent to my headphones.

Taotronics Bluetooth transmitter and receiver is excellent. Sound quality is fantastic and there is minimal lag. I have used in both settings. Receiving it worked flawlessly. Only when I went out of range with my phone did I need to reconnect.

The sound is clear and I haven't noticed a problem with the audio. No drops in the signal, even when walking far from the transmitter. Great little device.",5,1,2020-7-17,0,0,0
"Nicely packaged. Good build quality. Very easy to use.I am using it in my car. My headunit has no bluetooth. I am using this adapter so I can play music from my phone and then transmit it to my car's headunit via its 3.5 mm aux input. Would have been great if it had an auto switch on/off function when it gets power and when power is cut off. This way it would have switched on and off by itself everytime I turned my ignition on and off. It doesn't have that feature, so I have to do turn it on and off manually. Not an issue though. I like it. It's good value for money.",5,1,2019-5-13,0,0,0

"amazing little device which has so many uses. i used it for splitting the ipad so my kids can listen simultaneously on BT headsets. used it for making an old radio into a bluetooth receiver. used it for watching tv with my BT headset.it is a pain to use though for the first 5 times, so dont buy if you're not tech savvy. but once you get the hang of it it works well without dropping out",4,1,2019-10-21,0,0,0

"I used this product for connecting two sets of wireless earphones to an iPad. Connecting them is fine once you follow the instructions. Output quality was great, no lag at all. The only problem was that my partner, who was use airpods, found the volume a little low but we were on a plane which can be noisy. My earphones have independent volume control so I didn't find this at all. Overall, great product for a good price. Would definitely recommend.",5,1,2019-5-15,0,0,0

I bought the unit to enable bluetooth on my Hires portable digital music player which doesn't have bluetooth amd connect this to our family cars bluetooth system.

Worked great for just longer than the 3 month return period.this device worked essentially perfectly for just over 3 months then it stopped working all together. It does not pair nor can it be seen by any mobile device anymore. It has basically stopped transmitting.

"This product makes my life easier!It will transfer the sound from your video game console (Xbox one) to your bluetooth headphones smoothly.

I have only one negative, and it is not really a negative given the excellent after-sales service I received from this company, and this is that the first one they sent me stopped working after a month. It was replaced, no questions asked, free postage, everything wonderfully done, and the replacement arrived priority mail within a week. Now I have had this second device for two weeks and it is working excellently. So fingers crossed, I hope it keeps going because it really has improved my life being able to listen to the music i want to listen to instead of the modern stuff my family wants me to listen to.

"A couple of things have let this product down somewhat. First, the audio cable is very short and this seemed to cause some issues with audio lag. I replaced the short cable with a longer one and lag reduced but not enough to have audio properly synched with video. I am using Soundpeats True Wireless earbuds and have never had lag issues with them in any other bluetooth connections.Volume control is terrible. I use a sound level of 16 (on a scale of 0-100) in normal circumstances so a hearing impaired person can hear the sound properly. WIth this device I have to increase that to a level greater than 75 to hear the sound clearly. This is not acceptable.",4,1,2020-6-9,0,0,0

"Better quality than expected, and worked with what I originally bought it for (to transmit Bluetooth audio from my TV to my Bose qc35). Pairing/connection is surprisingly easy considering it has one button and no interface. However, the audio lag to my QC35's when watching something like Netflix etc was just a bit too much to not be distracting, sometimes what seems like half-full second. That's not the fault of the unit however as it supports aptX, it's an issue with the Bose QC35 headphones not supporting it for some unknown stupid reason. It should be fine with other headphones that support aptX like the Sony's etc. I fixed that issue by buying an aux cord extension so now I can watch TV through the headphones, and I've got the TaoTronic's plugged into the aux-input of a clock-radio for bluetooth music through my phone. Good stuff :)",4,1,2020-8-24,0,0,0
"Was super easy to set up, using it with my Logitech G633 headphones to make them wireless. Range is really good, the audio is super clear and the battery life is solid. The lack of volume controls is disappointing but not the end of the world.Also have tried it with my switch (so in transmitter mode) which also worked well, although it was a little difficult to get my headphones to pair. The instructions included do work, it just took a few tries. The latency is short enough that it's totally acceptable for casual gaming.",4,1,2020-7-11,0,0,0

"I can't fully comment on battery life because I only used the transmitting function for four hours on a recent flight but it didn't die in that period.

Great.  Does everything that it's supposed to do and sounds pretty decent.NOTE: My use case was very particular.  I bought two - one to transmit and the other to receive.  In order to pair them with each other you really need to get them away from other bluetooth devices and put both in pairing mode.  Takes a short while but it worked fine.,5,1,2018-9-26,0,1,0
