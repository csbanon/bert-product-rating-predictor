$25 piece of plastic?,1,0,2019-11-27,1,2,0
"Received Echo Show 8. Set up was super easy and I was using it in minutes. Appears to have wide range of abilities to discover. HOWEVER, having the ""Try this"" statement permanently plastered across the bottom of the screen is very annoying and distracting when viewing downloaded pictures. Amazon seems to believe people using the device are not intelligent enough to think of things for themselves. Will this change to allow their customers to show or not show these suggestions? Would give 5 star rating if it does.",3,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
"Definitely a must have with the Echo Show 8. Allows the screen to sit up higher, makes it adjustable and helps protect the device by keeping it up and free from spills if you are keeping it on the kitchen counter top. If protecting it from spills isn’t a worry I would still get it for the adjustability!",5,1,2019-11-30,1,1,1
"This stand attaches easily magnetically, but I was disappointed in the range of movement.  The forward tilt will not even go to level.  May return this and try to find a better solution.",2,1,2019-11-26,1,9,0
"I almost ordered a Show 5 & thought I wanted a Show 10.  I'm still not 100% that I wouldn't like a Show 10, but I'd have to think about it's footprint for placement.The Show 5 is great especially if the alarm clock feature is needed bedside.  I use it to video chat with my grandson and that's cool, but the screen is smaller than I pictured in my head.  The Show 8 is a great size.  I can watch videos, video chat, get the weather without any clarity issues and from across the room.  The Show 5, I'm not sure would work as well.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,3,0
Would be better if it had a wider range of angles.,5,1,2019-11-29,1,3,0
the stand only goes maybe a inch up or down and does not move in clock wise or counter clock wise. but its a good bedroom stand for it.,4,1,2019-11-29,1,3,0
"WOW!!!, the sound is awesome, deep and crisp base and treble.  Display is rich and crisp, best deal on the market.  Get the stand it’s perfect and adjustable. grab this for the perfect Xmas gift.  Price cannot be beat.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,3,0
Should be $10 at the most.,3,1,2019-12-15,1,3,1
I LOVE the show products but I cannot understand why its not an option to change the clock size. I own a Echo show 5 and the clock is customizable. On the larger shows you cannot change how the clock looks. I had a Echo show 5 for my bedroom and unfortunately the clock is small. I cannot see it from the other side of my room ( I have perfect vision). It almost seems these larger shows are not designed door bedrooms. Sadly I need top place this in my basement of living room and bring back my Echo show 5. Hope they fix this soon. Sounds great though. Perfect for listening to music while working.,3,1,2019-12-16,1,1,1
"Even with tutorials online that tell you ways you can access your Netflix accounts etc on this device, I have been unsuccessful at getting the browser to work, and wish I could use it to watch Netflix and stream Disney plus. That being said, I still like the device I just wish it was a little more user friendly but love the drop in option to check on my husband and my puppy when I'm not at home.I bought the stand to go with it, and its magnetic, so don't try to pick it up by the stand or it might detach and you'll drop it. It would be nice if the stand swiveled side to side instead of just up and down, but its a sturdy stand and pretty firm attachment considering its a magnet. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.",4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"I don't know why it is sold separately.  It is very handy, but that doesn't justify the price.  Depending on the location you might not need it at all.  It is great if you have it in the kitchen, or if multiple people of various heights will use it.  For me, it just sits in my office.  Although I really like the stand, and there isn't anything wrong about it, it just isn't necessary, it should be part of the Echo Show, ad the price is crazy for such a simple piece of plastic.",2,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0
"We have alexa dots in every bedroom in the house to listen to music or podcasts but this was perfect for the kitchen. It gives you recipes with video, has games to play. my kids love to ask it to show them lego sets or trailers of movies they want to see. I can tell it what to add to my grocery list and look at on the app in my phone. The sound quality is amazing. I love to blare music while working downstairs. It is also synced with our Ring doorbell 2 so we can see when someone is at the door",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0

"I bought this for my 96 year old mother who lives in another state so that she could see me when we talk, since she is extremely hard of hearing and I could use a dry erase board if I needed to. I also bought 3 others for family members. We all have a Smart Cellphone, my mother does not. We have tried everything, been on the phone for a long time with Amazon trying to set it up at my mothers house....their response....well it can do a lot of other things. Just not the one thing we wanted it for.  NO Where in the ""Fine Print"" does it say you have to have a Smart Phone or be able to download an Amazon App on your cell phone. I assumed since it was a device that worked off of the WiFi signal  that she could use it.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I wanted the 5 inch one specifically for the sunrise alarm, but thought this would be an improvement with regard to sound and visibility.  I was shocked that it didn't have a feature that both the expensive Show and the cheaper 5 inch had.  This needs to be added as a software update.Update- feature is working now.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,1,0
We upgraded from a echo dot to echo show!! Love everything about it! Took us awhile to realize various usage has different volumes so we thought it was low sounding but we just had to figure out the different volume settings. One negative thing we didn't like about this new echo show was she required music subscription to songs that we didn't have to subscribe to on out echo dot. My kids and I call her bougie Alexa because of this. We have to get a subscription for Amazon music to get songs we would normally play on our echo dot for free.Side note if you trade-in: Amazon will steal your cord if you turn in your echo dot with it.,5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,1
"Y 2nd generation echo show had developed problems. Often shutting off on its own or crackling sound, so I decided to get the ECHO SHOW 8. The screen size is the same as the 2nd generation echo show. I also bought the black stand for it. Personally I think you really need the stand. Anyway while I don’t do a large variety of things with my echo, I do have Alexa playing my radio stations or answering my questions. I’m not very electronics savvy so I don’t have things worked via Alexa. Lights, most phone calls etc but she’s great. Sound is terrific, screen is perfect size for viewing headlines  and photos. Great product. Great sound.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"I thought it would be nice to have a small screened device to watch a show on or something before bed.  Can't open Netflix on it, looks like there might be a web browser but I can't figure out how to use it.  Tired of Amazon requiring me to enable these ""skills"" for different apps I already have on my phone. Headspace app from my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 won't connect to it, despite customer service sending me a link that was supposed to make it work.  The sound quality is great, but the volume is too low on the device in general.  I have to turn it all the way to the top in order to play music for an alarm.  Regret buying it.",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"This stand is a must-have for your echoshow8. without the stand, it sits flat on surfaces. the stand keeps it away from accidental spills etc. I think  It's way overpriced but worth it.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,3,0
"I love having this - one is in my kitchen that enables me to watch my Prime shows while I am cooking.  Also, the sound quality is one of the best.  I listen to my music upstairs and the kids listed to theirs downstairs.  I love being able to call into the family to ask questions (especially when I have messy hands) and getting an immediate reply.  Also, announcing throughout the house if great when needed.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"No conferencing options! NONE! Even Skype support is crippled.I was hoping this would be great device to give to a friend to help ease the loneliness of stay-at-home orders. I could see that the Alexa app wouldn't permit more than a caller and a receiver, but when it claimed to use Skype as well, I naturally assumed that meant actual Skype with all its standard free features. The only part of Skype this uses is the contact list. You can call other Skype apps on other devices, but there are NO options to use any other feature of Skype. If you want to only ever call one person at a time this device is fine. If your intention is to find a piece of technology that is useful in these circumstances, to connect with groups of friends or family, look elsewhere.",1,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"My husband and I enjoy Echo 8 with stand. We keep it in the kitchen. It tells us the weather, keeps our reminders, we listen to music while prepare meals and watch prime shows if we choose to eat here. We can sing with it as it shows lyrics on the screen.  There are many other functions, like calling friends who also have ""Alexa"" and talking directly face to face with them. Also home security etc. Stand is rather small, so it stands low and the box is bulky, so it requires little space of it's own to stand. Price is affordable.  You may like it too.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"This has been a great addition to our Echo family. I have this in my kitchen. I enjoy catching up on news, strange facts and even tv shows. I don't want to bother putting a tv in my kitchen so I use this to watch things from AmazonVideo while I'm cooking or while my husband and I eat dinner. I do have one complaint, sometimes ""she"" doesn't understand what we are asking her to do.",5,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"I am still trying to figure out all that can be done with this. It is very cool and does have a lot of features. The one thing I found is, it does have a camera but due to the way it sits the camera faces the ceiling so I purchase the stand and there isn't enough range on it to move the camera down to see horizontally in the room. I think they are very nice though.",4,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"The Show 8 is a step up from the 5.  Rotating picture wallpaper is a real hit, and handy, easy to set up with photo app.  The sound is a perfect compliment to my paired echo plus.  Using music more and more.  Interactive display a plus, especially unexpected karaoke when lyrics displayed during music playback.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,1,0

This stand won’t tilt down enough to speak to a person who’s sitting down. This product is made to look up at a person while it’s placed on a counter or table.I had to insert shims to tilt it forward enough and hope that it won’t tilt forward.,2,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
"This was at the top of my husband's wish list for Christmas this year.  We absolutely love being able to stream music and get the lyrics on the screen.  Great for pulling up recipes at the last minute when I need an idea or help with a recipe.  Only issue is when streaming music, whenever a door is opened, the door alert causes Alexa to search on ""open door"" and it interrupts the music steam and I have to go back to re-start the play list again.  You can stream music from YouTube if you don't subscribe to Amazon Music.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"The stand needs major improvement, and I mean major!! front to back is what you get and the height of it is laughable.  The price is outrageous!!, I expected a much better product, I am so disappointed.",1,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0
"Pensaba que el Echo Show 8 debería funcionar sí o sí con este accesorio, pero puede hacerlo sin él. Sin embargo, no es una mala idea si necesitamos aprovechar la pantalla del Echo Show en varios ángulos de elevación.Lo que me sorprendió es la total facilidad para instalarlo. Tiene una superficie magnética que se adhiere realmente rápido al Echo Show.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,1
"Very nice stand, fits and color perfect. The only CON is that it is a bit pricey.  Other than that, looks nice.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,1,1
"Absolute rubbish, for the price of this piece of plastic it should be able to make the screen of the echo completely vertical. Doesn't even come close. The only thing this is good for is getting the echo off the counter, which you could use anything else for way cheaper.",1,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
"Looks good, the only thing is that if you push up the echo show to adjust viewing angle, it may come off the stand- which is attached via magnet.",3,1,2019-12-10,1,1,1

"I finally got my first Amazon Echo Show with Alexa. I am kicking myself for not getting one earlier! I have fell in love with these devices and their many capabilities that I bought a dot, 2 Echo Show 5’s an Echo Show 8 and the new Echo Show 8HD! I am loving all the things they do. If you don’t have one and you’re on the fence here is the breakdown, pros and cons:Breakdown: super SUPER easy to use. Plug in the power cord and follow the on screen steps to set up your device to your liking. There are multiple clock faces to choose from, sounds for alerts and you can pick a background or use your photos from Amazon’s photo app. (I also was new to that app and Alexa. Both were super easy to use! My pictures synced faster than any other photo cloud storing app hands down. Plus as a bonus you don’t need to pay for storage. There’s no limit and zero fees!!)",5,1,2020-1-16,1,6,0
I bought the Echo Show 8 and the stand and the slot in the show is too small for the stand.  Major dissapointment.,1,0,2019-11-27,1,3,1
"Amazing and very easy to hook up and network. This a product is awesome. High clarity, easy to install and intuitive. You don't have to be a tech guru to get this up and running. I loved the quality of the sound and video picture.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,9,0
"Mom and Dad just don't do well with talking on speaker from their phone. I had to set this all up for them but now that it is, we love it for chatting hands-free while we're wandering around the kitchen. The other stuff it does is okay. I prefer the Google Home search engine over Alexa but this Echo won me over because mom is afraid of ""big brother"". Telling her that she can mute the Echo and turn off the video was somewhat reassuring to her although she still thinks we're all being watch. We are though. It's the times.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
I am very happy I picked up this stand.  I was on the fence about picking it up for a long time.  I’m very happy I did. I wish I would have picked it up sooner.  It does make a difference with the sound.  I had it without the stand on my counter and when I would play music you could hear it vibrating since I bought the stand the vibration has stopped.,5,1,2020-3-12,1,6,1
"Like some other purchasers, I thought twice about spending $25 for this Echo 8 stand, but we decided we really did want the ability to adjust the viewing height.  Received the Echo-8 Show and stand today and are TOTALLY IMPRESSED!  The stand is a serious piece of quality, connecting with strong magnets instead of flimsy clips that will eventually snap off.  Yes, it may be “just a stand”, but the design is impeccable for the purpose.If you can wait for a special sale, do it, but otherwise, if you’re on the fence about this piece, I highly recommend this little work of art.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
Tiny little stand.  Very flimsy. It constantly fall off the small magnet.,1,1,2019-12-13,1,9,0
"Its easy to install but you can get the same value(and perhaps better sound quality) with a book you aren’t reading.Range of motion is not great in my opinion. I think this should just come standard with the show, not as a $25 add on.",1,1,2020-1-8,1,8,0
"It's a really nice stand. Like an Apple kinda thing where it's just perfect and really useful. But like Apple stuff it's way too expensive. I've noticed the new cases for the Fire HD tablets are the same way.I considered only giving it 3 stars because the price is so dumb. But it works really well. It makes the already excellent Echo Show 8 even better, and makes me feel better that if one of my kids spills a drink on the counter, it won't destroy the Echo.",4,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
"I have Amazon devices all over my house. I use them for everything - lights, music, weather, info....very helpful.

"The quality is fine and the price was appropriate, but I have the echo unit sitting on a small cabinet.  I also, as it were, have small children that like to drop-in on their grandmother and grandfather on occasion.  In order for their grandparents to see them, I have to physically hold the unit and tilt it down.  (I know... first world problem.)  I wish there was a way to tilt it further down using this stand.  I also cannot attach the unit to the base backwards because the base will not accommodate that.  I can tilt it up to the sky, but tilting it down to the ground is a surprisingly difficult task with this base.",3,1,2020-3-13,1,1,0

"This has been the greatest purchase I think I have ever made.  Well worth the money.  Fits perfectly on our kitchen counter.  I have my photos scrolling thru, which my wife loves.  I can't believe the sound quality difference between my Echo and this Show.  I'm tempted to replace my 2 Echo's with Shows.L-L-Love It !!!",5,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0

"The stand lifts your Show 8 a couple of inches off a counter.  It's well made, easily/magnetically connects to the Show, and seems sturdy.  The stand allows you to tilt the face of your show up and down from almost (but not quite) vertical back about 40 degrees.  That it... it doesn't rotate at all (which would be more useful as people tend to move around rooms horizontally rather than vertically).",2,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I would prefer to have greater choice on my news feed. I am not interested in Reuters, CNN, Bloomberg, and other such, ahem, ""news"" sources. I would like more control on content. Second, the All Recipes app is a disaster. Can't access favorites, again, can't control content, etc. Basically, the device does a good job as a countdown timer and a weather forecast display. That's about all that I can find useful right now. I do see great potential, though.",4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0

"This has been a game changer for me and my mom. My mom lives in an assisted living facility but has a hard time using her phone and remembering how to dial out. Well, I got her and me an echo and it has completely made communicating with her so easy. I had it set up in her little apartment near her bed and I just “drop in” and am able to see her and talk with her. I have her echo as well as mine on a stand to make it easier to adjust. She knows it’s me because she hears a ring to let her know I’m coming on the screen. She doesn’t have to do anything on her end!!! I absolutely love it because I can check in on her and see how she’s doing. I no longer have to use the staff to set up FaceTime because I have this. I have my echo in my office so I can drop in and say hello. What’s also cool is that I can use my iPhone as well if I’m at work and want to check in on my mom through the Alexa app. I think this is amazing!!!!  Anyone with an aging parent who doesn’t live with you should absolutely  have one of these!!!",5,1,2020-6-12,1,2,1
"I usually don't write negative reviews especially when it comes to Amazon products, I truly love my multiple Echo devices that I have but this stand is horrible on range of motion!We bought this during the begining of the pandemic and we set our Echo Show 8 on a normal sized bookshelf in our living roomabout waist height, I'm 5'7"". We needed something to help shift the camera angle downwards so our extended family could see us during our calls... So where else would you go to buy a stand but Amazon's own product line, right?",2,1,2020-8-11,1,1,0
"This was a great purchase!  We love it and we use it every day!  I see many complaining about ads and such - not sure what the issue with that is but I don't find anything being annoying - we enjoy all the information that comes across the screen.  Let's talk about it... large screen - makes watching videos or reading information so easy.  All you do is ask a question and BOOM its right there for you.  We talk to Alexa ALL THE TIME and told her she's now an adopted part of the family.  She appreciated that ;)  The sound is great as is the camera and if you don't want the camera on you can always flip the shutter.  I like that I can ""check in"" and see my mom during the day to make sure she's ok - it's almost like FaceTime.  We loved this so much we ordered another one for our bedroom.  The other rooms have the Echo Dots but I'm sure they'll upgrade to the Echo Show as we have a lot of fun with this.  You can also send an announcement to every device in the house if needed.  The features are plenty!  Works with any device you have connected - even the smart plug.  I love adding things to my shopping list too!  When I get to the store, I open the app and my shopping list is right there so I never forget a thing nor have to write anything down.  Want to cook a great meal but don't have a recipe?  Just ask and it will be on the screen with step by step instructions that you can watch as you go!  Want to listen to your favorite music or news station?  Just ask Alexa to play it and POOF its on!  If you are thinking about getting one - just do it!  You will love it!  I chose to get the stand because I like the way it looks.  With or without, this device will become a permanent favorite in your home!",5,1,2020-1-29,1,1,0
"Improved the general appearance and viewing angle of my Echo Show 8 located on an upper kitchen cabinet shelf.

"IMHO, this stand should be shipped with every Echo Show ‐ or, at the very least, Amazon should offer it as either a free-with-purchase promotional item or lower the price significantly.That's the only reason I give it 3 out of 5 stars (it's just way too over-priced). Otherwise, it is a great stand for my Echo Show 8.",3,1,2020-1-16,1,4,0

How much of a great value i think it is, and how it's helped me and quickly become a useful every tool.amazon - all you are doing by making the stand a separate cost which, as a piece of molded plastic, is nevertheless 25% of the cost of an echo show 8, is annoying loyal customers such as myself.",1,1,2020-8-20,1,1,0

Cant believe Amazon didn't make this to be able to down apps to say the least. Maybe if my house was completely smart than I would like this more. When u ask alexa to look something up she only does 15 items or so. Think I'm gonna try Facebook portal, at least that's 10"" plus you're capable to download apps and it has Alexa on ot also. Plus the camera follows u around while on video chat. This was not a win for me, sorry Amazon.",3,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Just my opinion but, not worth the price.  It does prop the echo up and give it a good viewing angle but your device is not exactly secure.  The top (where the echo show sits) is a rubber pad that is supposed to keep the unit in place.  There are no hold downs, clamps or clips to attach the two things together.  Even more surprising, while they provide the rubber top, the base of the stand has absolutely no rubber on it.  It's plastic and no matter what surface you put it on (especially another slippery surface such as a speaker or a counter top), it's prone to sliding.",3,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"I was extremely disappointed with the range of motion on this mount. It keeps it from pointing at the ceiling -- barely. It doesn't really tile down and the Show still points overhead and only catches part of the room, and our room is not very big. It does NOT swivel to the sides and doesn't told up or down very far.There must be a better option! Something with a proper swivel that will allow you to move it in every direction. It has to be about 2-3 feet off the floor to see our faces and the room.",2,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0

"I purchase this product by the recommendation of the Amazon representative who said he was very familiar with blank and this system would give me notifications if my blink camera system was triggered. He lied blink camera system does not send notifications to the echo eight is a complete waste of time buying this system if you're buying it to use with your blink security system which is also a waste. So what I have now is a $259 camera an FM radio alarm clock. Do not waste your money on the blink camera system, go somewhere else",1,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0

"I was a early Data Networking technologist. In the early 1990s I was telling clients that in the near future we would all be using a single home communication portal that would encompass voice, video and data. I can honestly say that after years of testing, designing and using various products that came close to being the usable vision, this device accomplishes all of those things. This device does everything it says it does and what it doesn't do right now, it soon will with further development.Not only have I cut cable company entertainment, but I have also have been able to cut Cell phone service using smartphone,  Skype, broadband and Echo technology.

What I wasn't expecting was the great sound that comes from such a simple device.

"I like the added versatility this stands gives you, being able to move and maneuver the Echo Show 8 to different angles, but it's ultimately a piece of plastic with a magnet. $25 seems steep for this, especially because it isn't a necessary accessory. $15 would be a much better price for it, and one that I could better justify. I'll say, my main reason for purchasing was to keep the Echo Show 8 off my nightstand so that a spill wouldn't ruin my device. Overall, it's as advertised and does its job. Just overpriced in my opinion.",4,1,2020-1-16,1,2,0
"We had a couple dots, a couple plugs, and now we have the 8"" Show. It's addictive. Some things are more difficult than I'd like them to be... like getting it to pull up weather radar (you have to find the right skill that includes that - try the NOAA skill), or getting it to browse Amazon. It'll do it, but unless you use it's browser (add the Silk browser to it to surf the web) you cannot view the entire product description page. I wish there was a skill for YouTube so I could just tell Alexa to play something. Instead, you have to go to the Silk browser and then go to your YouTube bookmark. At least it remembers your log in settings. We got it for video calls and haven't made any yet. But we use it for looking up recipes, listening to music, doing all the fun alexa stuff like question of the day and song quiz. It brings graphics to the table on those and other skills, so that's a definite plus. We got the stand with it and I highly recommend that.  Overall, a good purchase I would make again!",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"Very nice stand. I have to admit, at first I thought I had purchased this stand for my Echo 5 Show and was a bit disappointed when I saw it was for my Echo 8 Show. Regardless, I proceeded to see how the stand would look on the Echo 8 and if it was worth the price to keep it.The stand has a magnetic grip that fits right into the bottom of the stand. It's not an overly tight grip, but my Show 8 sits on my nightstand and it's very durable for where I need it. The stand raises my Alexa Echo 8 2"" above where I have the angle adjusted. By my adjusting the angle, I am able to reduce the glare off the screen when I have my large Levoit Himalayan decorative salt lamp sitting on the other corner of my nightstand.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0

"I have had an Echo Show 5 for several months and I love it. In fact, I love it so much I decided to give in to fading eyesight and get the bigger version....and I was immediately disappointed. One of the most delightful things about the Echo Show 5 was the clock faces. I love a good clock face that entertains and informs and the Show 5 delivered. Sadly the Show 8 doesn't. No choice of clocks. Period. You get one, with time, temperature, and an icon for ""sunny/cloudy."" That's it. Yes, it does everything else the Show 5 does, it has a beautiful large display and it's amazingly handy. I've owned some version of the Echo since the first. I love the device and will happily keep the Show 8, clock or no, but I can't help but be disappointed. How hard is it to program and install good clocks on the Show 8?

Also, it is way too expensive: $25 for a piece of plastic?, while the Echo Show is a marvel of electronics for just 4 times the price.  I bought the stand just because I needed it, otherwise it is really too expensive.",3,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0

The stand itself is kind of expensive, it really don't worth that much, I would say $10 is an acceptable price.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0

This stand was a joke.  I really wish I had returned it.  It does not have hardly any swivel to it.  Does not clamp on tightly at all - it just sits in a groove.  And it automatically angles it up which is not helpful as we needed more range to get it straight or angled down.  We just folded cardboard and put under our Echo which worked better.,2,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I’m not sure why sound quality is an option on the stars, I don’t think that it necessarily improves it being up off of the ground but it definitely works great, has a good angle range and in my opinion, should be included with all these echoes as watching anything or talking to people is definitely frustrating with the one initial angle of the device.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0

Great purchase for my older parents. They love the voice commands and ability to video call the grandkids by just asking Alexa to dial them (grandkids asily downloaded the free Alexa app to their phones from the app store). No more fumbling through complicated phone apps which for older folks (60-70 yrs olds) can become challenging and frustrating. This was a win win.

The echo show is fantastic. The stand is ridiculous. The price is insane for this piece of plastic. This should’ve come with the device little to say. Only moves up and down doesn’t let you rotate the echo show.

"I have 1 Echo Show 5 with a base and 3 Echo Show 8s, 2 with bases.  The Echo Show 5 base has a reasonably strong magnet and fits well.  I don't have a problem with it and was anticipating the same performance with the Echo Show 8 stand.  However the 8 stand magnet is very weak compared to the much bigger and heavier Show 8 When making height adjustments (tilt up or down) you have to use two hands, one to hold the stand and one to hold the Show 8, or the Show 8 will tip over and/or fall off the base.  If I had to hazard a guess, I would say Amazon used the same size magnet in both stands but due to the bigger/heavier Show 8 it's not adequate for the job.  The magnet in the Show 5 stand practically jumps on the Show 5 whereas you have to press on the Show 8 stand when putting it on as it feels like it will fall off just from gravity.",3,0,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I bought the Echo 8 show and had it less than a week.  My 7 year old granddaughter who I love so very much spilled apple juice on the table not far from my Echo Show.  Thankfully I was right there and was able to move the device out of the way.  Since the device was laying right flat on the table without any stand to raise it, any spill could easily get inside the device and ruined it.The stand itself looks nice with the device and does have some up and down movement.  But overpriced and should have come together with the Echo 8 Show.  Come on Amazon.  Sell the devices with the stand.  Would have been less expensive to have purchased insurance on the device.",4,0,2020-4-24,1,0,0

This is not a review since I can’t bring myself to spend 25.00 on a piece of plastic.

"I absolutely LOVE the Echo show 8 I bought myself. Initially I did not purchase it with a stand. Since I'm using it in the kitchen I thought I should get one. In the meanwhile, I put it up on a decorative box to get it off the countertop. It's about 4"" high so it gives me a better view of the Echo.  I finally bought the stand. The stand only raises it about 2"". I must say I am not impressed for the price... $24.99 really?? I don't need to adjust the screen up or down which is supposed to be an added feature of the stand.

"I love this product! The stand helps in keeping the Echo Show up off of the counter top and aids in positioning for different heights of the viewer. It also is handy when positioning is needed to read recipes while cooking. The Echo Show - 5 was purchased for my husband by his daughter as a Christmas gift (2019) so he could visit with his grandchildren over the miles. I was so impressed with it, I bought one for my son and one for my mother so we could all connect and watch my granddaughter grow. It also helped to keep us connected and together while being apart during the CVOID-19 outbreak. Thank you Alexa - Thank you Amazon!- Karry Brennan",5,0,2020-4-17,1,0,0

"Doesn't swivel at all disappointed, it does elevate the show I that I have, but for the price I'd use a book or something. Not worth the price, you go to tilt it, the base comes off, not sure where the magnetic parts come in, I don't see it",2,0,2020-9-2,1,0,0
Do not buy!  I bought it to be able to tilt while on calls with my parents.  Left it tilted and the next day my husband turned on amazon music.  The vibration of the music made echo slide off and it broke.  I’m so upset that something that is made specifically for a product actually breaks the product.,1,0,2020-5-4,1,0,0
Why should I have to buy this to have a $100 echo show NOT point at the ceiling. It should come with the stand TO BEGIN WITH or not be pointing at the ceiling to begin with. Super disappointed in the echo show 8,2,0,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I'm very pleased with the stand! It is not 100% needed with the Echo Show! You can use the Echo Show on a counter and it securely sits there with the rubber bottom, I was hesitant to even get the stand because $25 is a little much just for a little stand",5,0,2020-1-6,1,0,0

So easy to install. Takes more time to get it out of the box than putting it together. It connects with a magnet that rotates to any position. Excellent addition to the Alexa Show.,5,0,2020-1-6,1,0,0

Love it!  Was considering the 10” mainly for better sound quality.  Just couldn’t justify the extra cost.  This one ended up having pretty decent sound.,5,0,2020-5-11,1,0,0

The stand makes the device more versatile.I would welcome the stand as standard equipment for the Echo device.  It would no doubt inflate the cost but hopefully would be less than the combination added separately.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0

"Ease of use and it's just what it needs , should be included",5,0,2020-9-14,1,0,0
The ability to tilt the echo show to the correct viewing angle increases the enjoyment and usability of the device; I longer have to walk across the room to read the screen. This is important when reading the directions for cooking.,5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0

"I like the size for my work area, mainly listen to music & news. Once in awhile a movie. I have all 3 sizes & ea fits the space available in ea location. I also own7 echo dots & 1 Echo 2nd gen which is by far the best sounding of them all, I purchased the battery conversation for it so now I can take it with me anywhere! Hope they do that for the 10"" echo Show! That would be awesome!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
