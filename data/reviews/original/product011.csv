We now have three of these devices in our home to help save on our cable bill. We use them for the spectrum app and they work great! Very easy to set up. A word to the wise - I read a couple of reviews about an activation fee. I set two of these up today and there is no activation fee!! If you are being asked to pay a fee you are in the wrong place!  Do not google the set up website - type in the address as it is when prompted on the screen and you will be fine.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,1,0
"I finally decided to buy one to help keep my TV relevant. Most of the apps from my 2011 model TV don't work anymore and was limited in functionality. I wish I bought one of these years ago though. Now, reading through previous comments, there is someone who gave 2 stars and complained about being single banded WiFi. This guy doesn't pay attention to what hes looking at. Yes, this is clearly stated that it only uses 2.4GHz band. No, they didn't go backwards in any form with this. With a quick search, and all Roku Expresses, which is what this is, have been single band. And 2.4GHz is fine when only going 1080p for HD.Now about using it. Setting everything up doesn't take long, around 10-15 minutes. Once you have it set up, it's eay to use to get on Netflix, or Amazon Prime to watch your favorite shows. You can also download some other apps to get some free TV to you flip through another couple hundred channels and complain about there is nothing to watch, because we all know we do that. When watching something, the picture does take a minute to download, buffer, and catch up, so the first little bit may be a bit blurry, but it evens out. There is also the Roku app for your phone, and this adds some ease of use. Instead of using the remote to attempt to hit the sensor on the device, you can connect to the Roku on your phone as long as they are on the same WiFi network.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,5,0
"I had to return it today though I only had it for 1 day or so. Reason: There's activation fee of $100, which was not specified on the webpage when I made the purchase. Based on the description on the webpage, I was under the impression that I just have to pay for the device & get all the free channels I want. It described that I only have to pay for the channels that were not free. However, when I finally got a chance to install the device on my TV & tried to activate it using the code on the TV screen, it told me that it failed. I called the support phone# & was told by someone with heavy accent who rudely rambled on & on about all kinds of benefits of activating the device WITHOUT giving me a chance to talk. After he was done advertising for his company's product, he finally said it would cost me $100 to create an account in order to activate it. He told me also before I hung up the phone that if I decide to pay to create an account, I'd have to call Monday (it was Saturday when I called). This might have been a good product, but the company should've made buyers aware upfront of the activation fee. In all, I was totally disappointed.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,4,0
"Overall, was I eventually moderately satisfied. The initial setup was a breeze. However, I got a rude shock when the video from a lot of channels wouldn't stream - instead of video, I got only sound and error code 020. (Of note, I was trying to run our Roku through an HDMI signal switch.)As it turns out, a lot of HDMI signal switches/splitters sold on Amazon are NOT HDCP compatible. (HDCP is a form of digital copy protection; I only learned about this when trying to troubleshoot this Roku). A lot of channels available on the Roku use HDCP. So, as a result, content from those channels could not be streamed from the Roku to our TV through our HDMI switch/splitter. It took some Googling to figure this out - the Roku support article regarding HDCP error messages mostly discussed unplugging and replugging things, and turning things on and off again. It did not mention HDMI signal switch/splitter incompatibility. I would have been up and running more quickly, and ultimately more satisfied, if that had been the case.",4,1,2019-10-16,1,3,0
"I bought this Roku to expand into a fourth room, and I was happy to see that it was offered at a fraction of the cost of my other Roku models. Of course, this bare-boned unit asks for you to sacrifice some of the options on the more expensive units, such as a TV on/off button, volume control, and an earphone plug-in on the remote. All of these minor issues are easily solved by using both the Roku and the TV remotes or by employing the free Roku mobile app for iOS or Android.A major issue for some consumers might be the 2.4 GHz wireless connection. After several days of use, we have seen no issues. Streaming has been perfect, no lagging or interruptions, and load time seems no longer than any of the other Roku units we own.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,2,0
Why have they gone backwards from a few years ago and are producing new devices (this is not the first so be  careful) that support only the oldest 2.4 ghz wireless band.  They talk about high speed streaming needing a strong wifi network and internet connection but limit you to the slowest option on your modern router.  My Roku 2 second gen devices from 4 years ago do only support wireless N but they do so on both the 2.4 and 5.0 wireless bands.  This makes a big speed difference on any network but if you happen to live in a populated area it makes a HUGE difference.,2,0,2019-10-11,1,2,0
"Roku Express 2019 does not work if the tv is not connected to your xfinity wifi. You canNOT take this out of town & watch your recorded shows on a tv. You’re stuck with using xfinity app on your phone or tablet & watching on those small screens.Oh, and I read an online corporate statement and it does not even specify that the tv has to be on their wifi in your home. With further searching, I did find the exclusion",1,1,2019-11-11,1,1,1
"Bought to use with Xfinity ""Beta"" app.  This app is little awkward -  you can't switch channels by going Channel up or down, the interface (with 2.4 Ghz  ) is slow and unwieldy.Picture quality was OK, but definitely not better than the latest Comcast box.",3,1,2020-4-19,1,2,0

"This is my 5th Roku and it works just as good as the rest.  Don't be scared off by the 2.4 GHz wireless connection, I'm watching YouTube TV at full 1080p with plenty of speed left over.  Unless your network has a history of problems with 2.4 GHz connections, or you require 4K UHD quality, this is a great device that can be powered by your TV's USB port.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,1,0
"I have been working on overtime, a 2nd job and my damn nerves,  to do what??? Spend all my money on cable and diet water??? Not anymore!!! I decided to invest in a Roku to alleviate half of my stress! I had no idea the number of free channels at my disposal. And they are full of shows that I will actually watch and like!!! I am actually glad to come home to my spinster life of watching tv with my pets and practicing Spam Sculpture Art. I have watched classic tv shows and new and fresh ones now. Grab one while the prices are low!!",5,1,2019-10-28,1,6,0
"Installing this new 2019 version of the Roku streaming ""box,"" it messed up my TV, my cable and my head.  There was no telephone or online support for the problems I was contending with, only a disembodied voice when I called that said there were videos available online.  I looked at them but they did not help.  Fortunately, my friendly local cable company came to the rescue and explained how the system could work, making it a very pesky operation.Had I known there was no support, I would not have purchased this item and will probably look for a product from a different manufacturer given my feelings about Roku.",1,1,2019-10-14,1,6,0
"Great product for $24!  Does everything I need it to do..well hope it will.  I got it so I could watch Disney Plus on it when it is released.  Haven't seen the app for it yet, but it may not have dropped.  I'm sure it will.I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because it can't see my 5ghz signal from my router when the firestick sitting underneath it has no issues.  As of this writing the 2.4ghz hotspot it did find works okay but I'm worried I may not get the great quality I'm expecting.  I'm going to monitor this for a couple of weeks and report back.  But as of now, it's running well and was pretty easy to set up.  Not sure if there is a way to hook a wireless keyboard up to it or not, but that would have made adding all my streaming media accounts so much easier.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,2,0
"So far so good. The install was pretty straightforward,  I purchased two of these so I could stream Disney +. Unfortunately, the Amazon Fire Stick does not support Disney+. The Mandalorian- All of the Disney Classics, All of the Franchise films LucasFilm, Marvel, etc.  Amazon is loosing out here. Too bad. The Roku device, for the price is a very reasonable way to access the Disney+ content without fiddling around with another streaming subscription/ other that the Disney+ subscription of course.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,3,0
"I bought one of these devices for the simple reason of wanting to view Netflix and Amazon Prime on my television rather than being limited to my phone and Ipad.  I barely had it a few days before I was asking myself why I hadn't got one months, or years, earlier.  I had no idea of the existence of 'free' television services (Stirr, Pluto TV and more) that were available on this device in addition to those I had subscribed to.  It wasn't long after my first Roku purchase that I got 3 more Roku's for the other televisions in my home and ditched cable after 25+ years.  Between 'renting' our four cable boxes, paying for service, and paying a 8.95 a month FCC fee, our cable service through Spectrum was costing us about $160.00 a month. We no longer get local channels but can pick up one of our local news station broadcasts through a Stirr channel.  If you are not a big tv watcher at all or are the type who typically doesn't watch the newer shows on the big 3 channels (ABC, NBC, and CBS) then Roku in lieu of cable might be for you.  On another note, I'm the type that doesn't care at all for the Alexis/Google/voice command equipment, so if you can relate Roku is the standard, push button device that doesn't listen to you, though you can buy additional equipment to make it happen if that's the route you prefer.'",5,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"I have a new-ish TV and a subscription to Netflix, but until I got this Roku I could only watch Netflix on my laptop. This Roku was very affordable and I'm happy with the results. The high-def picture quality is very good, and the remote is responsive and easy to use. Set-up was easy too.I have one major complaint, which is that Roku requires you to give them your credit card along with other personal information. It's part of the setup process and as far as I could tell there's no way to get to use it without setting up an account and giving them this info. I don't plan to buy any movies or subscriptions through Roku, just stream Netflix, so I don't expect them to ever charge my card. I hated going through all that registration and being forced to give the company that info. But I'm still giving it 4 stars because I've done some research and it's clear to me that there's no better option -- the alternatives from Google, Amazon, and Apple are as intrusive if not more; all things considered, this Roku is as simple, practical, and user-friendly as you'll get, so I recommend it.",4,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0
"We have one of these in another room (an upgrade from an older model) and installation  was a breeze.  Great picture  quality.  My only complaint is the remote .  It sucks.We just bought a second one for another room, also to replace an older model.  It will connect to our WiFi network, but not to the Internet.  We’ve rebooted our router. We have a WiFi extender in the room. We’ve unplugged the Roku device, plugged it back up repeatedly, and it still won’t connect to the Internet.  The only troubleshooting advice I could find online was “contact your ISP” with nothing on screen to enable us to do that.  This makes no sense.  I may try calling them anyway, but it’s completely illogical.",1,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0
"I was extremely disappointed when after starting up Roku the code didn't go through gave me a number to call the person on the other side I could hardly understand about 20 other people talking in the background, all in all at the end of conversation I was asked to pay $100. for five years or $150. for forever. Roku never ask for any information or payment to them. Please Beware from this product!!!!",1,1,2019-11-19,1,1,0
"Don't know how many people are like me. Finally had to replace my 1st generation Roku 2100X box that just kept chugging away until it stopped loading Amazon Prime. For $30.00 I figured I couldn't go wrong. First impression, I was right. Since I already had a Roku box attached to my TV, it was super easy to unplug the old one and plug in the new one. The ""box"" itself is super small. Luckily they include a double sided sticky strip that holds the device in place. Set up was also very easy. It automatically detected the Wi-Fi and then it walks you through all the steps on your TV screen. Adding channels also really easy. The interface is very different from the old version. But since I'm the last guy on the block to get to the party, this is obviously the new look. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles - just something that will do the job of streaming the channels I actually watch. So far, this is a winner.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,1,0
"The product description says ""Low cost, no extra fees: ... and there’s no monthly equipment fee""  But the activation website requires the user to divulge credit card and personal information and will not activate the device without it.  Scammers may ask for activation fees, but this demand for personal information is not from a scammer, it is on the legitimate Roku activation page.  There is no legitimate reason to demand payment info up front rather than when the user subscribes to paid content, which gives the impression that it being gathered for illegitimate reasons such selling Personally Identifiable Information to other companies.I have two other Roku devices and neither of them required a credit card; I'm returning this one for a refund.",1,1,2019-11-21,1,8,0
"Bought this to stream Amazon prime videos but unfortunately never used it because of the unreasonable (my opinion) set up data requirements.  Connection to my TV and WiFi network was easy. The unit powered up and the ""set up"" menu appeared as expected. The menu directs you to login to the Roku web site with a second device to activate your unit. The Roku site requires you set up a Roku account to activate your unit.This is where I ran into my issue with the device. To set up an account you MUST enter your name, your address, your gender, your date of birth and your credit card information. Gender, address and birthday info is irrelevant and none of their bloody business as far as I'm concerned. Credit card information is also irrelevant if I only use the free streaming videos.",1,1,2020-1-23,1,7,0
"I purchased the Roku Express after hours of research on streaming products. I know streaming is old but it is new to me.

"I cut the cable cord quite some time ago and have used Chromecast to cast movies I have on a two terrabyte external drive to my television via my laptop, but for watching regular shows, I have Youtube TV which has my local stations plus many others including USA, TNT and others so with the Roku, I can watch shows as we ""used to"" many years ago before cable or I can watch the alternate channels like AMC or USA without being tethered to or paying for cable.  I really enjoy Roku for the flexibility it allows - I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to dump cable.  You do need an internet connection, but that's it.  Oh, the title refers to the fact that my order was due one day and it took two days to get to me.  Not a big deal, but hey...I was waiting for it!",5,1,2019-11-1,1,6,0

This is completely useless. I have it directly above my wifi extender. It''s not more than a foot and a half away from it and I can't keep this thing connected. I can't sign into any of my streaming channels because after I am done entering my information it has a network connection error. The wifi card in this thing must be an absolute piece of garbage. This is such a waste of money. I didn't want a stick because a use an HDMI splitter and you can't use a stick and plug in anything else. I have spent  hours trying to get any of my channels connected and You tube is the only one I got connected to and the network disconnects when you select a video. So it is basically a puck.,1,1,2019-11-16,1,3,0

I have been using Roku devices 2013 I remember when I first got Roku 1... I canceled my cable 5 days later. Then I brought another Roku for the second TV in the bedroom. Here it is 2020 and I had to update my Roku. so I bought this one hooked it up to my TV it was so simple and it updates on its own when new content becomes available on Roku. I don't know what else to say that this has everything that I need I no longer need cable TV I do not miss it since I got my Roku back in 2013. I am a huge Roku believer I should be working for them as much as I turn people on to them over the last 7 years. If you are tired of buying DVDs save your money because it's probably here on Roku they all Lotto apps where you can rent movies for under $3 and watch them on your TV. I paid about $24 for this Roku. If you are tired of paying high cable bills get a streaming device from Roku they have several to choose from this one is an entry-level it was enough for me.,5,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
First and last one I buy. First thing is it has no OFF button so the unit stays warm all the time which can’t be good on longevity. Also eats data compared to other devices. It is easy setup but it freezes up a lot and you have to unplug it to start over and it doesn’t save what your watching to the correct spot. I have very fast WiFi for other devices and it still freezes with everything else turned off. I would guess a software problem.,1,1,2020-1-11,1,3,0
"I bought this device to add to an older Sony Bravia TV that's attached to Xfinity. Setup was easy (I'm moderately tech-savvy), but it was all downhill from there. I got the Roku home screen, but it was very dark and colorless. I searched Google for a remedy: I had to go to anything streaming (any Netflix show, Sling, whatever), push the Options button, go to Picture Mode and adjust from there. Simple enough (though the Roku help site didn't tell me this); except it didn't work. Options gave me only two options, neither of which was helpful. I know more options should be available, because I have a Roku TV with lots of options. I called customer service, which told me that, because of the pandemic (it's June 2020), they have no live help. But I see from other reviews that they had no live help before the pandemic (Oct. 2019) either. I am sending this thing back, and am very disappointed in what I expected to be a great product.",1,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
This product gives me more channels than I ever expected. I can even watch sports and the news and many movies  including oldies without cable. It is an excellent device. I have never owned one before or anything comprable. It gives excellent quality picture and sound. My televisions volume was very poor because when I worked out I had to turn it all the way up to the top level. With this roku I have to turn it down very low because the volume is amplified.All I can say is it's an product for the money well-worth the very small investment. I got the brand new one hot off the press. I did not want the Alexa with it. But it does come with one. This is such a great item that I am going to buy one for my entire family.,5,1,2019-10-28,1,2,0

"What I like: Great user interface, easy to setup, and unlike my Fire TV Stick, ROKU Express includes an app-channel for Spectrum which works really well, almost don't need the Spectrum cable box.What I don't like: No support for 5 gHz wifi connections. This should not matter as the 2 gHz connection should provide enough bandpass but evidently it is barely sufficient for HD viewing.  Second, the screen quality is like going back a generation or two. The Fire TV Stick provides a brilliant, clear, incredible display--the ROKU is not even in the ball park. Finally, there is no speech recognition through the remote.

I just bought this product and when I attempted to activate it it came up as an error and informed me to call an 866 number from a company named IDA to activate my Roku. I was informed that there was a one time activation fee of $69.99.  I informed him that nothing on Amazon stated that there are activation fees and I refused to pay it.  This 866 number popped up on my screen during the activation process appearing to be legit. He told me this was an independent company working for Roku. I said BS and hung up. I then contacted Roku's website directly and activated without any further problems.  Please be careful and do not fall for their nonsense. It even states on Roku's screen that they will never charge for activation or updates.  Amazon should look into this since it will create a lot of ill will towards Amazon.

Someone on that site with barely intelligible English told me I did not have a Roku account (I did) and that due to a lawsuit I would need to pay $70 to register my device. Luckily I hung up and went over to my desktop to enter the URL in the top, which took me to the Roku website where registration was free and easy.

"We needed to downsize our monthly cable bill so were returning the rented converter boxes and instead bought Roku Express.  Set up was very easy, the Roku system is very affordable (they have several different models to fit your needs) and the Express was all we really needed.

Now we not only get cable service (through the streaming system) but we get a lot of other free channels/shows/movies/tv that we didn't get before.  Another perk...no more ugly cables exposed as everything is plugged directly into the back of the tv.  Great reception with a reduced monthly cable bill.  We were so impressed that we now have all of our sets hooked up to Roku Express, even a smart tv that had no cable hookup located in our sunroom.

I'm unsure if it's just a faulty remote or if this is a common thing, but because of this, I'll likely just recommend the Amazon FireStick...plus, for the same price, the FireStick allows for volume control and talking to the remote (Alexa) to just pull up whatever it is you want to watch. To get those features on the Roku, I would have had to spend quite a bit more...still, all that aside, since I knew what I was purchasing, it's really frustrating having to reset my Roku every time I use it, so that I have sound.",3,1,2020-4-16,1,2,0

When things calm down I'll get in touch with them and get some advice (or drop the $5 a month for the cloud).  As of now almost everything I watch is on the ""on demand"" feature. I have to wait deal with some commercials, and there's a day lag on shows usually (I can deal with that for what I'm saving!)

I contacted support who was very helpful and sent me a replacement.  They said it is compatible with my TV, but it is not.  I tried it on a newer model Vizio and it immediately connected to my wifi.  Unfortunately, it was not the TV that I wanted Roku on.  The old Roku  that I had is beginning to stop connecting to certain apps like You Tube and Amazon Prime Video, so I thought this would work, now I am at a loss.  I am not sure which one will work with my TV (which is working fine), so wanted to be able to watch movies on Prime Video.  If anyone has suggestions on which stream player that is compatible with this particular TV, I would be grateful.  I tried going into my computer to see if I could find it on the wifi search but it wasn't there.  So beware, it is not compatible with all HDTV's.",1,1,2019-11-14,1,1,0

"This is my third Roku. I was having difficulty with my second device seeming to need to buffer every few seconds and the remote not responding. I found some information online the gave tips on how to determine if it was the device itself or the remote and running through that process determined that the device itself had probably worn out. So I decided to get a new one and this version was just coming out the middle of October so I placed an advanced order and received it around the 15th. It was extremely easy to set up, except for the hassle of having to go online, enter code, verify etcetera. But once that was done I don't want her had problems with thanks I wanted to watch buffering constantly. And this device is so small it fits in the palm of my hand and I've got small hands.I live in a building built out of concrete and surrounded by a bunch of other concrete buildings. So my television reception is iffy. When I try to watch a channel through my antenna I'm just as likely as not to have the program cut off midstream. So I pretty much given up watching regular TV.

"My 60"" Panasonic Plasma TV sits on a nice TV table.  I prefer to have my Roku device sitting on the TV table, not attached to the TV. I am reasonable tech literate. I was VERY surprised at the 2-foot length of the enclosed HDMI/HDMI chord. It  flat out wasn't long enough. Very annoying to have them skimp on the chord. Fortunately, I had a longer cable and used that one. Next issue: when I used my cable TV remote, it would change input from cable TV to Roku. I would have to disconnect the Roku every time. This is not acceptable!  Fortunately, I was able to solve it. On your Roku go to Settings/System/Control Other Devices. Choose One touch Play. Then uncheck that option. When checked, then any other remote will trigger a Roku input. That should really be unchecked by default!! There was also some additional pains to log in to each app (Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Apple-TV for me), but this is to be expected. Once the aforementioned issues  (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), it appears to be working very very well! Oh, and the IOS remote works great too",4,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0

"i needed this only for amazon prime. i have satellite internet (i live in the country) with limited data. setup was easy, though roku will ask you what channels you subscribe to (i said none) what your interests are (i didn't select any) and what channels you want to add (they're free to add! - they don't tell you you'll pay for content). then it ignored all of that and spent fifteen minutes installing 30 channels on my device. between that the and immediate software update, it used 600 MB of my precious data. but wait, it gets worse! the amazon prime app on this device doesn't allow you to select streaming quality, so it was streaming at 1080p burning through 1.5 GB/hour of programming. also, the video and audio were out of sync and the app failed to connect about 75% of the time, telling me my internet connection was bad when every other app on the device could see the internet just fine. and then, of course, there's the constant advertising on the roku home screen. it's going back and i'll just buy dvds for the shows that come 'free' with my amazon prime subscription. cheaper in the long run and i can watch off line. oh, i wasted almost an hour with four different techs on amazon chat trying to fix the issues (they kept handing me off) to no avail. a lot of this may be amazon's fault (they've crossed the line to evil now), but bottom line is it doesn't do what i need.",1,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0

"I ordered 4 of these on a sale. They arrived the very next day. I reviewed a video on line how to set them up. Everything you need is included inside the box. I removed the Comcast TV adapters and installed each of these in the 4 bedrooms. You will need to set up a Roku account on-line using your PC, tablet or laptop. I didn't need to enter a credit card but you will need to if you desire to purchase movies or premium channels. There is a place at the top of the page to activate a device. You will need to enter the code from your TV. In my use I needed to download the Xfinity Streaming app. Then you will need to agree to the terms and name the device (location) and input the code given. I would say it takes about 20-30 minutes for each device; that includes removing the TV adapter, unboxing and connecting the Roku, rebooting and updating the software and TV channels you added. I turned in the TV adapters the next day and started saving $30 a month on my bill. I think the TV picture is even clearer. These are great! I give them ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.

Yes, the higher priced ones are nicer, include things like headphone jacks, better wifi, etc. But for the price, this one performs above expectations, is easy to set up, and is a great value.

The setup is pretty easy and FREE, I have seen some reviews where people are saying they are being asked to pay. Any paid services can be bypassed when setting up. You don't have to pay for any additional features except for services you want like Netflix,Disney Etc. Pro Tip: Check out the App PlutoTv it's basically free cable television.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,4,0
"I use three different levels of Roku devices in the house, this review is for the Express edition. As a Roku, it is fine. As an add on device, it has issues. First, the remote is IR (infrared), which means you have to have line of sight between the remote the receiver to work. If you have a busy TV area, be prepared to re-design it to allow for lack of RF in the remote. Second, the included HDMI cable is very short, maybe 18 inches. So.....Roku first requires you to position the receiver to be visible to the remote but Roku then requires you do so within 18 inches of your HDMI input on the back of your TV. Oh, the fun. If you don't have a 6' HDMI cable, get one (adds another 10 bucks to the cost). Thirdly, the power cable is short. I think most people at this point have TVs mounted on their walls and so route their cables in a raceway or through the wall. If that's you, buy a 3 or 6 foot extension because you'll need it.And the icing on the cake? The ""I heart Roku"" sticker of course. Swap the sticker for a longer HDMI cable when you ship an add on device with an IR remote.",2,1,2019-12-30,1,3,0
"Everything seemed great with the Roku until I went back to watching cable TV. Went to look at the info for a program and the Roku home screen popped up. I tried hiding the Roku receiver behind the DVR but that didn't make a difference. I had to unplug the Roku to stop the problem. This was a situation caused by two problems. Apparently the DVR and the Roku must run on the same frequency and because the HDMI cord provided with the Roku is only 24"" long there wasn't a choice on where else to put the receiver except right next to the DVR. I had to switch out the HDMI cord with a 72"" one so I could place the Roku receiver four feet away from the DVR. Now if I am careful and aim the DVR remote at the DVR it seems to work. I guess for cost reasons Roku has decided to provide an exceedingly short HDMI cable with the unit. Seems a bit cheap on their part to me.",3,1,2019-11-5,1,3,0
"I have read similar reviews here: during the installation, the roku.com website forced me to submit my payment information.

I then repeated the process, this time instead of moving forward with payment, I hit the back button of the browser, then it let me finish the installation.I don't think this is a malware, but it is Roku's intention to force customers into giving them payment information.",2,1,2019-11-3,1,6,0
"Very disappointed with this device. Every week it disconnected from the Wifi and in order to get it connected to the internet again I would have to do a factory reset. No matter how many times I would input the password it would tell me that the password was incorrect. On some occasions it would accept the password only to disconnect from the WiFi a few moments later. I also tried doing the network reset option and that didn’t work either. Unplugging the device or doing a factory reset were the only things that (most of the time) would get me back onto the WiFi. I even doubled checked my password by disconnecting my iPhone from the WiFi and connecting it again using the same password and it connected with no problems. There is no way to turn off the device, so it stays on. I feel like this may be what could be contributing to the issues that I am experiencing. If that wasn’t enough of a pain in the a**, every time I did a factory reset I would need to input the login information for every one of my streaming services. Most of the reviews on this device seem positive so I’ll just end by saying that I may have received a defective device but if you do experience these issues return the device right away and get your money back while you still can.  Unfortunately, I thought the issue was solved when I did the first factory reset and missed the return cut off date. Going to try my luck with FireStick.",2,1,2019-12-25,1,4,1

"The most exciting thing about Roku Express HD Streaming Media Player 2019 is that you can stream xfinity channel line-up for your xfinity package.

Fired it up, added some services and it only displays on the top left 1/4 of screen.  Read ROKU forums and found a large amount of people who have had the same experience.  One of the suggested fixes was simply unplugging the power supply and trying again.

Never ever buy this product. For one the picture quality is absolutely terrible and it also goes in and out to the point that it’s blurrier than tv was before high definition. It also messes up my sound bar about 3-4 times for each show that I watch which means I am constantly resetting my volume. The TV ads are much much louder than the actual shows which can be startling so make sure you mute the volume every time the ads are about to come on. Also every single time I watch Netflix there is no volume and I have to exit out and reset my Roku several times before the volume will work on Netflix. Over a week ago two of my channels stopped working. Anytime I try to watch a show on one of those two channels it takes me back to the home screen. I called customer support and explained to them what was going on and the lady at the Indian call center put me on hold for five minutes and came back and told me that if I just waited it out it would correct itself and then she literally hung up on me. It’s been about eight or nine days since I made that call and I still am unable to watch either of those channels. DO. NOT. BUY. A. ROKU. I’d give negative stars if it were an option.,1,1,2020-1-9,1,5,0

Fast forward to 2019 where only Netflix still works and I've received notifications from Hulu and Amazon that my Smart TV is no longer supported.  Back in 2013 I paid more than +$2000 for it.Enter the Roku Express HD  I bought for $29 on a Cyber Monday deal.  For almost 1/100th of the original TV it brings live back to my TV set.  I already had a Google Chromecast and still have that attached to my Sony.  But the Roku interface +  TV remote makes it much easier to use.

"UPDATE:  Within a short time the screen started turning pink and we lost volume on a repeating basis.  We would unplug the unit which was hot, let it cool and replug, only to have it occur again and again.  Waste of money.  Glad I got product protection, but still ridiculous that this product is so poorly made.I can only compare this to my Amazon Fire Stick and Xfinity remote, and there is absolutely no comparison.  The set up took a long time simply because this Roku would not pick up the router signal.  Firestick, the laptop, smart phone, the tablet and Alexa all pick up the router in the exact same location, but Roku kept missing it and giving out error messages.  I had to plug the Roku into another tv closer to the router/modem to complete set and then move it back to its intended tv to get it to work.  Once set up was completed, Roku somehow found the router signal that it could not find during set up and now I have service.  We use it to stream Xfinity beta on a tv with no tv box.  The remote is clunky and time consuming to use. There is no surfing from channel to channel.  You have to hit return, or often go back to home and start the tv search all over again.  The best you can do is go back to recent channels or plug into favorite channels, and even these steps are time consuming.  I realize that this is an entry level unit at less than $30, and that these streaming devices are one size fits all gaming pieces intended to pick up many different services.  But with the sophistication of today's technology, one would think they could produce something that better emulates a tv remote.  I am not asking for voice activation (available on more expensive models), just the ability to surf through channels without going back and forth, left, right and home.  Channel up, channel down does not seem much to ask for.  But it does pick up tv service.  The picture quality is inferior to Firestick on the same tv,  just fair.  There is no volume control--must use the tv remote for that.",1,1,2019-11-11,1,5,0
What a piece of Junk. So I bought this because my horrible cable supplier in their infinite wisdom has decided that they only want to work on a Roku (Xfinity). Had it a total of a month. Guess what it updated last night. Guess what it doesn’t work anymore. Had to do a factory reset. I’ve been a loyal Apple TV owner for over 5 years. Guess what. This has never happened to me using their product. Never did I have to reset back to factory to actually get the product to work after a reset. If it wasn’t exactly one day over my return this POS would be going back. What junk. Stick with an Apple TV if you can.  Much better product. Yeah you definitely get what you pay for!,1,1,2019-12-17,1,5,1

Will make you fill out a consumer survey just to use this device.

"I have multiple smart devices in my house including bluray players, cable boxes, and TVs. That being said I previously purchased 3 firestick HDs (which I love), and this Roku Express because the smart sticks seems to carry the bulk of all apps available and keep them updated. The only reason I got the Roku device over another firestick was because it supports the Xfinity Stream app and allows me to get live TV on my screened porch without needing to run a coax cable for a box... basically I want live sports out there. It works fine and accomplished what I wanted, but I much prefer the firesticks interface and what seems to be better developed apps and remote control with built in Alexa. The Roku is a little less intuitive and the interface is clumsy. I also can’t get Apple TV to login despite it being a supported device. All my firesticks set up much quicker and are easier to use. The Roku is about $10 cheaper than the firestick HD to be fair and it works perfectly fine, but if you don’t need something specifically only being offered on the Roku, I recommend going with the firestick HD.

As an xfinity (Comcast) cable customer I love my tv but don’t want to pay a recurring $10 fee for all additional tv boxes in my house. Enter this device.This can plug into your tv’s HDMI and has an Xfinity stream app which has all your tv channels as well as DVR recordings. Works like a charm even on wireless. I put mine in my garage for my workout setup in front of my treadmill.,5,1,2019-12-4,1,2,0
"I had a ROKU stick with remote that worked for at least seven years. I recently heard that Netflix would no longer support that version so I upgraded to the new 2019 HDMI ROKU. I don't see any better speed, and the construction of the remote itself feels way cheaper.  As compared to seven years, I wonder how long this new remote will work.",3,1,2019-10-17,1,3,0
"Easy to read instructions. Quick setup. I am so happy to be able to stream my online tutorials on my TV now instead of my small phone screen!!! Perfect for those with perfectly good TVs that aren't smart but want easy access to apps, live streaming & more. My only problem is the remote is just too small. It gets easily lost in the sea of crafting materials so easily. We have an older model with a somewhat larger remote. I might have to go back to double check to compare though. Great device. Highly recommend. Much cheaper than buying a new TV or bluray player.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,2,0
"So, when I first got this, I was really excited. The reasons I gave this 2 stars, though, is because one, you have to be able to point the remote at the little box, which I didn't know, and for me, the Netflix app on here didn't work. i tried everything. I played with the settings on both the Netflix app and the Roku, restarted the Roku, undownloaded and downloaded the app (multiple times), took to the internet. Nothing I tried helped, and it didn't really help that all the articles and videos I watched are from 2-4 years ago. Then, when I tried to return it, on the first day UPS didn't pick it up like they were supposed to. I waited another day until I contacted Amazon. The next day when I contacted them, before I did, UPS knocked and when I went answer the door 30 seconds later, they were gone. They came the next day. It took 3 days when I should have taken 1. Overall, I would recommend than instead getting this, get a Amazon Fire TV Stick. I returned this and today I just got the new one. I am excited for that, as I have the older version and it still works, it just is getting old (we have had it since it came out) and has started freezing a little bit (I am just realizing how long this was, sorry about that...).",2,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"I was upset that I had to upgrade from my older Roku 2 because it was no longer able to stream You tube. Every time I clicked on the You tube icon it would start to load and then bounce back to the Roku home screen. This is apparently a very common problem as there are allot of supposed fixes online  for this problem. I tried all of the suggested fixes without any success. I did finally find that this problem is an issue with You tube and not Roku and decided to take a chance with the Roku Express. It did fix the issue I was having with You tube and it had other positives as well. Using it on You tube it responds much faster than my older Roku 2. It's also many times easier to fast forward and reverse videos on You tube which was always very problematic with the Roku 2. So if you are experiencing the You tube issue I describe, bite the bullet and get the Roku Express. Even though I was a bit upset about having to upgrade because of the You tube issue, the  much better performance I feel now made it worth it. Going to hold onto the Roku 2 and see if possibly a fix might be found for this issue in the future  and use it elsewhere in the house or possibly just give it to someone.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"Ordered a Roku thinking it'd be a cheap alternative to buying a smartTV. I have a number of streaming services that I subscribe to and all of them are supported on the Roku. After receiving the device I begin the setup only to learn that Roku REQUIRES credit card information from you to even make your account and use it. With all the recent data leaks going on online, I try to minimize how many places my card info gets stored when I actually use it, and they're requiring me to provide it before I can even use the roku to stream services I already pay for? I submitted a support ticket on their website asking how to make an account without a credit card. Almost 2 weeks without a reply now.",1,1,2019-12-10,1,3,0
"The newly 'compact' remote is fine - but hard to figure out where things are by 'feel' - buttons too 'flat' can't distinguish between 'arrows' and ok - also, every 10-15 minutes just drops - no reason and you have to go all the way back to where you were - and you lose several minutes of show - have to figure out where you were 'resume' does not go back to when Roku dropped . . . very frustrating - primarily with Amazon Prime Video - maybe why there is no ""Prime Video"" button on the new remotes . . .  I like the 3 version better but I do like being able to 'stick' the Roku onto the TV keeping it in place.  Miss the older versions picking up remote signal from almost anywhere - not this newer one though you have to aim almost exactly . . . hard to do in the dark and the Roku 'light' is way to tiny and dim.

"I bought this for my mother to help her transition with cutting the cord. There was no way she would be able to remember what app had each of her shows etc. & she loves her shows, true to the stereotype of post menopausal women I suppose (p.s. I am female so I can say this...)My issue is it seems like the apps don't get updates enough or something. For some reason hulu has issues constantly. No problems with tubi, netflix, amazon, peacock - all of those work great. But dammit - hulu, I need you to keep her happy & roku always throws an error message every couple of minutes. When I watch hulu on my xbox one - no problems with errors. Idk if it's because this is the least expensive roku or if it is all roku devices.",4,1,2020-8-6,1,1,0
"First of all let me say as far as the device, it's easy to set up, works great and seams a little faster than my older Roku Streaming sticks 3500, BUT IT ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT WORK WITH A 10 YEARSOLD VIZIO TV, THAT WORKED WITH MY ROKU STREAMING STICK.  I bought this Roku Express just to upgrade and to put my older streaming stick in guest bedroom.  But not matter what I did, after plugging in , correctly I might add, it would keep coming up on screen with no support. I researched Roku support community and it turns out many people were having this same problem. I did all of the troubleshooting that was suggested, checking cable tightness, plugged in my old one and changed from auto detect, to 1080  and 720 it made no difference. Since it is older and the TV itself doesn't have a way to manually upgrade firmware,  There was nothing else to do. I took  Roku Express,  in the spare bedroom, plugged it in and in literally seconds the setup screen was on and I had it setup in a couple of minutes.  Then I tried it on my Vizio again , same thing , no support error message on screen.  Then I unplugged it and put in on my Haier TV which is also older model, and it worked perfectly.  So if you have an older Vizio you might want to check and see if it's compatible. I couldn't find this information on the Roku site but it should be out there somewhere.  Anyway the device itself is really nice, quick setup on compatible TV, but did not work on older model Vizio.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,1,0
"I have an older Samsung smart tv and held off ordering any kind of Roku-like device for fear it wouldn't work with my tv. Comments I read suggested the Roku Express for my circumstances. Wow. So easy to set up, even for this 70-year-old woman. Beautiful picture quality. So many channel options. Particularly timely due to the quarantine. Now, with so many viewing options, my fear is that I'll never want to leave the house. Highly recommend for anyone who just wants a simple device that works really well.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,2,0
"This is my 4th or 5 roku so I know what I am doing with them. Bought this one for Moms house and it has major problems. It restarts itself every few hours. The picture freezes every 3 or 4 minutes. Audio is out of sync, statisticy and distorted. I replaced the HDMI cable, restarted, multiple times, changed all the setting as I know some audio problems can be fixed that way but nothing helped. I hooked an older roku up and it worked flawlessly so I know for sure it is the new just bought roku. Contacted Amaaon about getting it replaced and had to spend 30 minutes arguing with support. Finally got them to replace when I said never mind I will just return it and buy 1 at walmart.No need of the lack of customer service and aggravation I had to go though to get a brand new item that is defective replaced.

"Bought this to support Disney+ on our 2015 Samsung smart TV. It honestly didn't occur to me that it wouldn't work before we signed up for Disney+, so this was a much cheaper way to access it than buying a whole new TV. Overall, we all like the Roku and my 7 and 5yos can easily navigate the remote. The interface is clear and simple, and if you use multiple streaming services, they're all in there for you. If you're someone like me who reads all the private policy notices, be sure to allot a solid hour and a half for all that reading upon set up. One thing I haven't figured out yet is if there's a way to add things to the watchlist without actually having to click on it and go into it first. It would save time if you could do that just from the main menu. But overall, we like it. There were no sign up fees, I read other reviews stating there are.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,1,0
"UPDATE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USE: This has been nothing but trouble. We have to reset it (pull power cord) about once a day.  About once a week it says ""not connected to the internet"" - which is funny, because everything else in the house is and works fine.  Sometimes unplugging it for 30"" will work.  Sometimes you have to do it 4-5 times.  Sometimes we give up, come back a few hours later, and miraculously, it somehow ""found the internet"" and works just like it was supposed to all along, la-de-dah.  If it's during the day and that happens, our grandson just finds something else to do.  He now knows the phrase ""The internet isn't working today"" as that's what we tell him.  If, however, this BS occurs in the evening when we'd like to watch a movie, that's another story because ""a few hours later"" means we'll be in bed.Our old unit never had this problem.  Yes, it was slower and didn't have some cool features, BUT IT WORKED RELIABLY.  This new unit is UNRELIABLE.",1,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Bought this for my mom so she could watch Netflix and Prime Video (doesn't have a smart tv).  We were impressed enough that I went and bought a Roku TV for my grandmother (she needed a new tv) and another one of these for myself.  It's been great to have during these stay-at-home orders.  Like some others experienced, mom's started to misbehave, rebooting while she was watching and eventually not working at all (about 2 weeks into owning it).  Amazon sent a replacement which seems to be fine.  I've had no issues with mine.  Set-up was easy enough, make yourself a Roku account online.  Looks like there's no way around providing a credit card these days, I searched and tried!  Unsuccessful.  Ah well.  A charge will only be incurred if you choose to buy something (or there's a data breach!).  There's no set-up or ongoing service charge for the device itself.  Cancelled my Netflix DVD subscription because I can get everything on Roku that I had in my queue (with the help of HBOgo and ShowAnytime apps, as those are part of my cable service).  That alone will have it paying for itself in just a couple months.  Picture quality on my tv is great, a little pale on mom's tv but still very good.  Mine has briefly lost connection a couple of times, but that could be my Spectrum internet.  Can't compare this one to other, fancier models -- we're very pleased with this basic, inexpensive option.  I do wish it could be turned off, seems like it'll eventually burn itself out running 24/7.  Maybe that's the design plan.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"This is the 3rd ROKU  I've purchased through Amazon and up until now I've been thoroughly pleased with the ease of setup and the operation of the device..  This Time, during setup, after I entered the code displayed on the screen an ""error"" message displayed I was told  NOT to request a new code but to call number shown to get new code and assistance with setting up ..... WELL big mistake!!! Do not get scammed like I did...  I was told that after June 3, 2020 ROKU is requiring all Users to signup for an annual plan for $149 or the Lifetime Plan for $199....  Well after 2 hours of back and forth..  my main objective was to set up my new Roku...  I fell for the Scam...  paying the $199...  immediately I received an Invoice and then was redirected to PayPal to pay the fee...  I tried to pay with my Credit Card knowing I had some protection if I was dissatisfied....  Well, that didn't work,  as they wanted you to pay with your Debit card....  Thankfully I was not successful getting the transaction to process with PayPal so the phony scammer processed the transaction with my credit card...  After completing the transaction I did not have a good feeling about the whole experience so I then went to the ROKU website and right away I read that ""ROKU does not charge fees for setup or use of the device,  if you have been charged fees YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED""!....  Long story I know but I immediately disputed the transaction on my credit card..  When I tried to contact the ""Customer Service"" number to cancel the ""Lifetime Membership"", which I was told I could at any time....  no answer..  or they blocked by cell number....  I setup new User ID's and passwords, cleared out the ROKU device to the Factory Settings and was able to go through the normal setup process without any issues.....  Thank You!",5,1,2020-8-15,1,1,0
"If you only care about watching movies and TV shows in 1080p, from well-known sources, this unit will work fine.  The devil is in the details.  While I was not looking for 4K or UHD capability, I failed to consider processing power.  A Roku box is a small computer!  And the Express apparently lacks sufficient power/resources to provide a pleasing experience in all respects.  However, it does provide clear, fully saturated, well color balanced video streams -- most video content looks good while streaming.  It also does a credible job of down-scaling higher resolution content.So, why only three stars?  First and foremost, I finally figured out that Roku is an open platform for amateur content providers, many of which have limited computer programming skills.  This may be a plus for some users, and this platform/community could become much stronger over time.  In early 2020, however, there are literaly 1000s of ""channels"" and no way to determine their quality except to sample them one-by-one.  My biggest frustration is in the area of ""screen savers"".  I bought this Roku Express to replace a 1st gen ChromeCast unit, which now provides stuttering audio on most YouTube clips.  I have been spoiled by the vast collection of Google images available to that unit's screen saver function.  I tend to leave my flat-screen TV on, with the steaming Screen Saver running for long periods of time.  I can no longer do that with a Roku Express because streaming Channels cannot be used as a Screen Saver!",3,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"My roku works fine for streaming content for the most part, but as far as the functionality of certain other advertised features, it fails utterly. For instance, it does NOT work with google home. I have confirmed this through extensive internet research, with endless people complaining about the issue and asking for help, but not a single resolution, or response from roku that I could find. Mine says that it’s connected, but when you actually try a voice command, the google home just says it can’t communicate with the roku. Furthermore, I can’t troubleshoot this with roku because my particular product, although newly purchased, is ineligible for product support, just access to tons of unanswered FAQ’s in their community forum.There are also little issues, like if I try to set a screensaver other than the default options, it doesn’t work and defaults back to the roku logo. Also a heads up, it does not support 5G WiFi, which they don’t claim, but I didn’t realize this prior to purchasing. And lastly, my Apple TV app specifically glitches out every time I try to use it with my living room tv. I have to repeatedly try to play an episode, getting an error message each time, until it finally plays, which could take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes.",2,1,2020-5-18,1,1,0
This roku took my husband all of ten minutes to set up for our sons room. There were NO extra fees to pay or anything weird like some of these reviews said. I am super glad I decided to buy it instead of listening to some of those reviews.I bought it because he didn’t have a smart TV. UNFORTUNATELY a week later a random ghost stranger (according to my three children) must have knocked said TV off dresser because it was magically cracked- so I ended up having to buy a smart TV and am no longer using the roku.,5,1,2020-6-17,1,1,0

"It’s good for the price. Unfortunately, the picture seems to switch from HD on its own because it starts to slightly blur or not appear as focused and sharp. Then, on its own, it’ll switch back to HD pic. It’s not a constant thing but it is enough where you can’t sit through a movie or show without it happening. There is no volume button on the remote, so you still operate it off your own TV or soundbar, which I have. I’ve been having an issue where I’m having to restart it more often now. I never had the issue with my fire stick. It just seems to freeze often and constantly has a lack of internet connection on it. I’ve tried adjusting the position of the device also. It sits right by the WiFi box so it can’t be anymore convenient to obtain a signal. Then when I check the WiFi signal, it’s always at full percent and functions well. I’ll probably upgrade to another device. It took a couple of months for this to start happening. I have 3 of these devices in my home and this happens often yet they’re the only device to be running at the time? The ease of use is great.

The forums on Roku that involve other users with the same problem have no resolution for this from Roku. They keep getting told to check their passwords even though they are in the same situation is me where we can verify that the passwords are completely correct.

When Netflix told me my Sharp TV would no longer support streaming movies ( and its not that old a TV) I had to choose to either get a new smart tv or go to Roku.  So even though I found the reviews confusing and often contradictory I bought the Roku Express HD Streaming Media Player 2019 for about $22.00  I figured if it didn't work out my out of pocket costs were now.Let me say that this was the easiest install, set up and operation I have ever experienced with any electronic device.  My tv had 4 HDMI posts and USB port and I knew my passwords for Netflix and Amazon which I subscribe to, so the it took about 20 minutes to set up and have it working.

There's all kinds of national and world news too. We already had Netflix and Amazon Prime anyway, and with the Roku, we added CBS All Access. We lucked out because pretty much every show we watch is on CBS, and for $9.99/month we can watch any show we want, any time we want, commercial-free. There are so many channels and options!

Based on their community pages, hundreds, if not thousands, are having the same problem.There's also the issue of their date collection practices: basically, according to the policy you must consent to, they will collect every bit of data transmitted over your wife, including from all your devices - phone, computers, anything on wifi - and sort it, track it and sell it.",1,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

Okay so let me start by saying the TV that this is being hooked up to is a 1080p it is an old television that was never used except for gaming in my son's room. I did not feel like spending the extra money for a extra cable box in his room so I decided to buy this and it has turned out as an excellent option with this he now has a working television in his room we use it to stream Netflix Amazon prime and there are various other free options that come with it.

"I had initial problems setting this thing up. When trying to connect to a Frontier FIOS router it refused to connect showing an incorrect password.  I enable guest wi-fi on the router and it did connect using the guest wi-fi password. Subsequently it updated its firmware. After that it did connect to my router in standard mode.  As others have said it is 2.4 GHz only.  I did not like the fact Roku needs a credit card to register online. I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime, both paid services and have no intention of adding more. I don't like having a credit card on file when it is not going to ever be used. That is just a data breach target. No thanks! There are workarounds you can find on the internet that utilize PayPal, so you don't have to use a credit card. It took me a awhile to realize the up arrow means capital letters on the password interface. In Windows that means go up on the file tree. Yet, if you go to other password interfaces for the paid services clicking the ""abc"" button capitalizes the letters.  The unit does work well with quite a bit of free TV options.

still one of the best streaming devices ive ever bought. Best bang for your buck. easy to set up works great and has everything i need for streaming basic services. The only negative and its not really that big of a deal is that if im standing too close to the IR sensor and not aiming directly at it the remote has a hard time making the connection at anything less than 6 feet. luckily ive learned lately that social distancing can make things so much better and by just stepping back a few more feet the problem is solved.,5,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0

If we wanted to switch from channel 4, for example, to channel 68, we picked up the room and entered “68” and we were there.With Roku, turning on the TV now requires two remotes, not one.  And navigating simply to the news is 8 steps.  While we now get 1,000 channels, if we want to watch HBO through our Spectrum subscription, that requires 8 steps and scrolling through 500 channels.  And, for sure, there will be buffering issues.  And if you are watching the same show as someone in the next room, there can be a minute or so difference.",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
I bought this to put on a third TV. I bought a ROKU TV and liked it so much I purchased a ROKU for another TV I had. I liked them both so much I purchased this one for my third. I enjoy the free stations that have a lot of older programs on that I enjoy. It's easy to use. My streaming is very good as well. I am hoping ROKU stays in business. I will purchase ROKU TV's from now on if they are available. Most of their add on devices are very good. I would always want to purchase their later models they are always improving.,5,1,2020-7-30,1,1,0
"This is a very easy to use streaming device. Streaming services can be loaded from the Roku app so you only see what you need (in my case Netflix/Prime video/YouTube) and avoid all unwanted apps usually seen on a smart TV. A great upgrade for a nonsmart TV or an outdated smart TV (I bought 3 already @24.00 each). The only inconvenience is the remote that only has Roku functions, no tv power/channel/volume/source. But there's a 14 dll programmable remote here on Amazon that adds exactly those buttons while keeping the Roku functions untouched. I don't care about picture quality HD 4K 8K and all that crap...",5,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
"I had read in another review that an HDMI splitter would need to be HDCP compatible to work with this Roku.  My splitter is HDCP compatible, but still, it did not work with my splitter.  As a matter of fact, for whatever reason, it would not work in my living room, even when plugged in independently in the HDMI port on the television, possibly because I used the existing HDMI cable (Hi-Def cable, at that).  I finally gave up in exasperation and moved the new unit to the bedroom, and put the older Roku LT unit in the living room.  They both work just fine now.  I guess I'm good until Roku stops supporting the Roku LT, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.  Me mindful of your setup when you order this unit.  The HDMI cable provided, which may be a necessity to get this unit to work as it should,  is extremely short!",4,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"If your ""smart"" TV has WiFi problems like both my Sony and LG TV's do, the Roku Express will likely solve those problems. I'm not saying it's perfect for everyone, as one reviewer who gave it 1 star angrily (albeit correctly) noted, it ""does not offer a native web browser to surf the internet...game over."" But another complaint I read that might be taken seriously (as it could actually be an issue in some instances) is that it only supports WiFi transmission up to 2.4 GHz. To be sure, if all things were equal, something like the Firestick (which also supports 5.0) might be the better choice, but since the Roku Express is currently $10 cheaper, and 2.4 is perfect for my needs, I'm personally happy with the Roku Express.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I was happy that this unit pulled over my selected channels from my old Roku stick that died. I did not like all the pre-loaded channels that Roku put on there automatically.  If I wanted hulu, sling, Netflix, ESPN, or mlb to name a few I could have selected them myself during setup. Unless I subscribe, why would I want them in my channel lineup?  The option to plug into the tv instead of the power outlet is really nice. I will miss the no miss no fuss of the stick.  I had to finagle the little box a bit to wedge it where it would stay pointed frontward. The cords kept trying to pull it off to the side and I refuse to add tape too that will eventually become a dust magnet when this unit dies.  Overall, picture is very clear.  Sound started out alarmingly loud, but I was able to adjust it.  My old stick initiated faster and I'm not crazy about the format.",4,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"I don’t know why anyone would bother trying anything else because ROKU makes a product that works well and works easily and simply right out of the box!  No complicated setup, etc. This is my third ROKU.  I have had the other 2 for several years.  I even take them with me when I travel.  Only problem with them is that I had to buy new remotes because I keep dropping them and the battery cover breaks.  This newer version has a lighter and smaller streaming box (not sure that matters much unless you want to glue it to a wall/TV).  The remote is also slimmer and lighter, but still works basically the same way.  One of my TVs is a smart TV, but since I use all 3, it is easier to have the same interface on all 3 for me.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0

Finally caved and I love the roku. I don’t have to wait for the tv to “warm up” anymore before accessing the apps and it’s so smooth and easy to navigate. Wish I hadn’t bothered with smart TVs and just jumped to this. Well worth $25.Some cons though: There isn’t any volume control on this remote so you still have to use your regular tv remote. Also, the buttons on the remote are for specific apps which I guess is good if you have those, but wish they were customizable. Finally, the sticky thing to attach the little box to your tv doesn’t really work if it’s hanging underneath. It was fine when it was attached to the base and didn’t have gravity working against it.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"It has some nice features. But closed captioning on Prime Video no longer works, and you cannot see star ratings or give them on Netflix. The loss of the Prime button is annoying, but that is Amazon's problem, not ROKU's. But the loss of closed captioning is disgusting. It only works during replay. So if you use the goback button, you get a few seconds of captions, then they shut off again. They work fine on Netflix, so I know I have the setting correct. And the new ""user interface"" for Netflix is awful. Instead of seeing that a movie has 3 stars, it just starts playing the movie for you. YUK. And you can only give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down after watching. All in all, not a pleasant experience. Keep your old ROKU as long as you can.",2,1,2019-11-11,1,2,0

Eventually the picture does sharpen.  Granted, I did buy the cheapest model. The picture quality may be better on the more expensive devices. Overall, I would definitely recommend.

Morons that they are will loss my business as soon as I can replace them too. On another issue while not naming the cable company they Deliberately Interrupt the bandwidth used by my devices such as Firestick, AppleTV, GoogleTV, ROKU and others I use. Which causes delays, freezing and signal loss all the time. But if you use their Cable or online services it never happens.

The most difficult thing was remembering the passwords on the apps we added. Since we kept our main cable box, we simply added the Spectrum app to the Roku menu. You just don't have the convenience of getting around the cable channels easily with the simple Roku remote like you did with the cable remote. That's really nothing, though.

In fact, here I am a couple months after use of my Roku thinking about cancelling the Tube too (but the hubby loves the live sports so I best not).

"Don't get me wrong. For $24, this device can turn any TV into a smart TV. I had to make the switch to Roku because I recently switched to an Internet version of Cable TV and the app didn't work on my fire stick or old AppleTV. I bought the $50 version and the $24 to compare them. On the surface, these appeared to have very similar features, but this one lacks an RF remote which means it requires an IR receiver (included, but clunky). The remote also lacked controls for the TV (power, volume) which means you still need your TV remote. It also lacked the voice control, which I didn't think would be a big deal, but makes the user interface a bit more painful. The Wifi also seems to be not as strong as the 4k. All in all, the interface is the same, but I would go with the more expensive one to get a better remote, better connectivity, and better streaming (4k vs. HD).",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

It never gets bogged down and it never really lags (unless it's for a second, and it's usually an app error, not a Roku error). There are more options available on the Roku and it solidly integrates all of your accounts across the devices. So I never have to log in to every single app. Just once with my login info for DirecTv and then all apps that use that are automatically synced. Excellent usability, and easy interface.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
I bought 2 of these. They work amazing. Saves a lot of money compared to Paying for cable. We use Netflix and youtube... and that has been enough for us. They do have tons of free kids shows and channels which is very nice. I have not had any issues with the signal at all. The only thing I would like to point out is that the remote does not have volume buttons. So you will definitely be using your other remote for that. Does not bother us. Just wanted to point it out just in case. I really enjoy have Roku Tv. And also... there is no such thing as an activation fee. Just make sure to follow the instructions in the box and you should have any issues.,5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Ok, so I have been a fire TV user FOREVER. I still have some in my house, but I'm replacing them with Roku units and TVs. FireTVs are slow, filled with ads, have overheating problems. It's hard to find content, and good luck with getting the Alexa remote stuff working. Roku is AWESOME - they have by far, the best and most fully featured catalog of applications and TV content. It's easy to look up content, and play native content. Did I mention how fast this UI is? Slick as butter, very responsive, and not full of a bunch of ads.

I bought this because I was told that there were not many ads however with my experience watching some shows that were roughly 30 minutes long I got between 25 and 30 ads broken up into ad breaks consisting of anywhere from 3 - 6 ads each break. A HUGE disappointment and not at all what I was expecting. The plus side would be that the device is small and compact so it hides away easily, the setup was fairly simple and the picture quality was fine for me. I don't have a 4k tv though so I can't speak to what it looks like on that kind of screen.",2,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"First of all there is no charge for activating  this device, people that claimed that were either scammed or gave a bogus  review...This looks great on a 1080p monitor, but you have to have a monitor with built in speakers or a headphone output, the speakers on my monitor (Sceptre 24"" 1080p 75 hz) suck so I hooked up a mini soundbar using the headphone output, You also need a HDMI input",4,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0

"For the Roku product line, you certainly can't beat the price. It's a minimum-frills device, perfect for the budget-conscious or persons needing a streamer for an older, smaller 720 or 1080 TV screen. (It does not deliver UHD.) One thing to note: it only connects to WiFi thru the 2.4GHz band. In my house, I have 2.4GHz and 5GHz dual band routers, and the networks have the same SSID/passwords on both bands. If attempting to control the Roku via their iOS app and my phone is connected to the 5GHz band, it can't ""see"" the Roku on the 2.4GHz band and gives a connection error. (What's odd is the individual channel control apps like YouTube, Netflix etc. all seem to find the Roku fine.)

VERY TIME CONSUMING and cumbersome vs. connecting 1 bluetooth keyboard or 1Keyboard on my Mac and just using that to sign up for multiple services.Different models. This model had the cheap remote without the volume control. If I get a roku I'd get the one with the volume control. But the 1st reason I gave is a dealbreaker. Too slow of a setup process and that matters if it breaks and I have to do it all over again.,1,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0

On top of that, there was no way for us to update our player to include streaming for Disney Plus so we decided to take a gamble on the Roku Express. Just had to plug it in, sign up for a free account, and activate it. Super easy to set up. So far, we've been able to stream all the apps we've downloaded without any issues at all.

However, this remote took 2 hours to load the stations and then was too slow to load causing buffering issues--none of which I have with the firesticks.

My very old ROKU player bit the dust a few months ago. I finally decided to get another one. I had no idea how cheap they are now. This little one replaced it for a fraction of the price. It arrived today and was set up in less than ten minutes. Simple. And - it works! I do not understand what fees people are talking about in these reviews. When I hooked it up there was a message clearly stating that ROKU does NOT charge fees. This player is exactly what I needed and I just wish I would have bought it sooner.

Instead of getting advertisements like one does on the Firestick, Roku provides me with the installed apps and quick links to items I need.

I've noticed that sometimes when starting up and opening an app, I get an error stating that I need to turn my tv off and unplug the Roku from the tv and restart.

Been a happy Roku user for many years now.  Got this unit to add to one of my bedrooms.  Everything went fine and I'm overall happy with the purchase and plan on keeping it.There are 2 concerns I do have with it. 1) The remote that comes with it doesn't have an intergrated 3.5mm audio jack like my other Roku 3 units I own.  I really like that option and really wish this one came with it.  2) It's overall speed is much slower than my older Roku 3's.  I noticed when I tested it that it took almost 25 seconds for the screen resolution to sharpen up so the picture was smooth.  Every video I pulled up looked grainy but 25 seconds later looked alot better.,5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
Let me first off start by saying I normally love roku I have used them for years . But this is my second new model and after sending the first one back I am now sending the second one back they both seem to overheat and disconnect from WiFi. Very frustrating if you are watching more than a few hours. I like to have my tv on while working and after a few hours it just stops working. If you shut it off for awhile it works again for a few hours.

Super happy customer! Also it's very small so doesnt take that much space at all . literally fits in the Palm of your hand.

"I spent 6 hours over two days attempting installation on two different Toshiba TV's with my streaming device, including watching available videos and help info.  I never was able to get beyond the Roku logo on my screen with one TV and the other one showed a picture one quarter of the screen size.  After several attempts reinstalling, and unable to contact a live person at Roku for assistance, I finally returned the item to Amazon. I received an email on 5/9/20 from Amazon saying I had been given the credit but it's not showing on my statement.  Now, adding insult to injury, I've wasted an hour with 3 different Amazon Customer Service people, including a so-called Specialist who disconnected my call.  The only consolation is that I chose to sell my Roku stock right after this experience and made 177% profit from it at its 52-week high. I then ordered the Amazon Fire Stick which I easily installed in a few minutes!

There are plenty of YouTube videos that will teach you have to do that. Other than that, this was totally worth the investment, especially when cable companies change the contract after 6 months to a year depending on the company. Not to mention we were paying for hundreds of channels we weren’t using. Now with all types of streaming packages, you’re better of purchasing this to stream all of these. The downside is I wish YouTube not YouTube Tv was accessible and free. It would be nice to watch random YouTube videos on the big screen.",4,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I am writing this review not so much about the product, which so far appears great. But I was very glad I read reviews ahead of time, especially regarding a possible additional fee to activate the Roku account. So I knew ahead of time that  any attempt to collect a fee was fraudulent. Even still I was led down the garden path... until I realized what was happening and shut the conversation down.  The important thing to watch out for is the point at which you have to go to your computer to enter an activation code from your TV screen. Here you can easily end up going to a scammer site that promotes a telephone number: "" Any problem, call us !!"" In your face promotion of a support telephone number. Back out and check the site and look carefully for Roku's genuine site. Much less in your face promotion and quickly you get the right kind of support without a solicitation.Other than that, the set up was super easy and I'm happy so far:).

We installed it on the TV in our office and it works fantastic and lets us stream all our favorite apps and yes that includes the Spectrum app which I wish was included on our FireStick. The only downside of the Roku is that the remote doesn't control the TV like power or volume which we love about the FireStick, but I guess it's the price we have to pay to get the Spectrum app. Other than that, it's a great streaming device and at a really fair price.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0

We have a Roku Ultra 4K  at home and I got this for an older 720p non-smart TV at our weekend cabin.  We don't have the bandwidth at the cabin to stream in 4K so this basic roku works fine but it is bare bones without the same search and configuration options as the higher end model.

Just so everyone knows all of a sudden you have to pay to have the Roku box! As of July 2020 it's $60 for 3 years. Which is fine but it clearly says that there is no activation fee! So they changed the word to update! If you want to turn your Roku box on you have to pay for an update! It will not work without the update so basically you're paying for activation! I would have no problem paying it but I do not like being lied to they should say there is an activation fee that it needs an update for $60!

I'm returning this device for a refund and shopping for a REPLACEMENT FOR MY OTHER ONE FOR WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ""UPDATE"" THAT ONE TO REQUIRE AN ACTIVATION FEE.",1,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"Roku forced me to ""upgrade"" from my old Roku XR model (which was perfect) so I got this for upstairs.  There's two principal irritations with this model.  First the wifi antenna is weak.  Every other wifi device shows perfect signal, but this couldn't get the signal from downstairs.  So I added an upstairs wireless access point, still it says signal ""Fair.""  That's some weak sauce.  It is usable though, with no stuttering.Second, there's a Prime video called ""Rainstorm for sleep - black screen"" and what it's supposed to do is completely blank out the screen while playing only the sound.  The Roku XR did this properly, but the Express leaves the backlight on the screen on (yes, it's the same TV).  So there's a gray glow in the room and it won't get completely dark.",2,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
If you are hoping this simple stick to work with a wireless router of the Linksys type..forget about it...I have tried this with three different Linksys WiFi Routers and even with the Roku HD Express right next to the router it does not stay connected and drops out so we ordered the type with a 10/100 Internet connection and / HDMI connector on the back of the box...this is not an Express model and it solved the problem...we give the Hard Wired Version a 4.75 star rating....we never give full 5 stars...but do not buy the HD express...if you are using wifi...it does not stay connected!,3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"We have been using roku for about 2 years. It was nice to get out of paying for dish.We get the channels we want and pay for that alone. By pay i mean sling, hulu and well we already had orime. So i spent 30.00 bucks or so and thats it. If you are buying this system roku. There is NO activation so any of those comments on here are full of bull. Just bought a 2nd system and a replacement remote for 5 bucks cause my puppy ate the other. Again i love this system.

"My old Roku 1, which I bought in 2013, was not performing well anymore and I knew it was time to upgrade to a new model.  Since I don't have a 4K TV, the Roku Express was my choice.  I love it!  It's lightning fast when loading channels, plus I noticed a slight improvement in picture quality over my old Roku 1.  Its tiny size allowed me to mount it directly to the underside of my TV for a sleek look, and I can power it via my TV's USB port.  Nice!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"This roku worked well for what i wanted to do and was the cheapest solution, but what they don't tell you anywhere that this Roku does not have a power off button or volume control even in the roku phone app volume control with your phone only works with some apps .... However you can turn it on with the remote just not off. Pretty bad design if you ask me. One way i did find a ""hack"" to turn the TV ""off"",  just open up youtube and play a video called 24 hours + of pure black screen. Kind of ridiculous but the only way to have a dark room if you don't want to get out of bed to turn it off if you want to sleep. Super annoying! ! If anyone has a better solution let me know.",3,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Great product, beware of idiots who dont know how to set stuff up! Theres NO activation fee with roku! You simply make a account and add your card information so you can BUY APPS! You dont need to buy apps! Roku works this way! I recommend this roku for kids rooms or dorms, small apartments! No problem with it on my tv screen! It gives you the option how to set it up!

Once I got use to its operation I have added many of the cable programs found on Dish TV minus all their many channels that only sell watches, clothes, and assorted potions, etc  I have the opportunity to get local news from surrounding cities.

I looked at the packaging more closely and realized that the website listed was not roku.com (official site) but for something just a bit off from that.The return process was easy - I brought it to Kohls and was refunded quickly.",1,1,2019-11-19,1,2,0
"We had an old Roku that never worked on my non-Smart flat screen tv, so I thought I’d try a newer version and I am very pleased.  I can now get Netflix and Hulu on my older tv! Easy set up, probably because we still had the old wires from the previous Roku. Remote is easy to navigate. There is also a way to set up without entering your cc number, just google it.......had some buffering issues which seems resolved by moving the Roku to the other side of the cable box so it’s slightly closer to the WiFi",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

This item is not the stick type that you plug on HDMI and that's it, my first mistake, i thought it was and for this you need a sticker (included) else it will hang and it will be hard for the remote to work.

"After being completely satisfied with several streaming stick +'s, we decided to add an express to a project room. The quality is right along with our other devices.

You don’t have to set up unless you want to subscribe to their channels. If you are using it for your own subscriptions like Netflix, Disney+ or Amazon Prime Video. Honestly love it!

So, I ordered a Roku Express, and to my delight, it was much better than my FireTV stick. Picture quality is outstanding, and the ROKU channel has great content. I was also surprised that Amazon din't offer a price reduction for my shipping delay. In this case, it resulted in three soon-to-be discarded Fire TV sticks.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
I purchased the roku device thinking that all I had to do was set it up. Pay for channels that were not free. When I tried to hook it up it keep saying failed. Call customer support. When I called and spoke to customer support someone they informed me of a “NEW ACTIVATION” fee. I had to  pay $89 for them to allow my roku to activate. After paying the fee it worked. Now as I look into roku requiring activation fees. I see all the reviews saying don’t pay the fee. DONT ORDER FROM THIS SCAM COMPANY ON AMAZON!!! I got scammed! Be aware!,1,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"I watched my kids with there Roku and seen how they were able to go from different streaming services and finally got it myself. It works great and I get connected fast. The only down side is that the TV portion goes through the internet and doesn't come in as clear. When I watch regular TV I just switch the HMDI over, no big deal, except my husband can't remember that most of the time. The Roku doesn't have the volume on it, no big deal.

Pushing the astrix button only deletes it from your home screen, not from the channel lists that any kid can easily click on and then inadvertently be exposed to channel icons with nudity, etc.We bought this brand new.

Put up with streaming from a Sony BluRay player for 3 years to our projector in media room. We bought this same Roku for our kitchen TV a few months ago and liked it so much we bought a second one for our main viewing location.

"One of the reasons why I bought the Roku streaming player is to get rid of my expensive cable TV! Most of the time, we’re at work and school and we don’t really watch regular programming on cable except for news. I chose Roku because it had the most selections of streaming channels, plus, it has TFC (The Filipino Channel). The picture quality is great and the remote is easy to use. There are also a lot of free shows without any subscriptions. And even with subscriptions, it’s still cheaper than cable TV.",5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"I honestly really like this product and it works great. What I dislike is that the remote must be pointed directly at the receiver (I mounted it on the side of TV) or it does not pick up signal. I tend to point at TV and most often does not pick up signal. When I aim at side it does. Little issue, but still an issue. The TV remote works if pointed in direction of, does not have to be pointed specifically at an area",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"This is a good device and the price can't be beat. The only minor annoyance, and why I knocked a star off, is that the remote is IR. So it needs line of site to the device. At this price point that is acceptable, but it does take away a bit of convenience, especially considering the included HDMI cable is only around 1 foot long. Overall I would definitely recommend with the caveat that you will need line of sight for the remote or use the Roku app.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
We do have other Rocky devices in our home so we are very familiar with the product and how it functions however we’ve noticed this one is constantly buffering and freezing up and the picture quality is fuzzy even with HDMI wire.

The Roku channel library is a plentiful treasure trove of streaming mediums and other channels that I can watch with the help of my cable tv subscription. The only downside to this product is that some of the more well known and popular Roku  channels require your cable tv account information. Additionally, seldom is live tv available on this product.

"This was my second purchase for bedroom tv which is an older Sharp Aquos HDTV. The major issue is audio, whenever commercials play, the audio becomes distorted and out of sync. After some suggested workarounds by other users having same issue, none fixed the issue permanently.

Awesome little box to centralize your streaming media content. Purchased because our older TVs aren't able to get the Disney+ App via the native TV shop.

My key purpose was to use the Spectrum App to access my local cable channels and not have to pay an additional  $6.99 a month for a cable box. I am already paying for 2 receivers and DVRs from Spectrum and have their  cable service.  The Roku would allow me to receive about half my paid Spectrum channels but not the other half, the half that contained many of the local channels.  Roku provides no customer support except via the Internet and that is poor.  Spectrum was good and tried for half an hour to solve the problem but could not.  An Amazon rep tried to resolve and answer my questions but failed and so now I am returning the Roku.  Very poor service from Roku.

I cannot ad my other services to ROKU without being charged a monthly fee from ROKU.  I am tempted to throw it out.,1,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
The roku express HD streaming media player is so easy  to set up. I was amazed on how user friendly  it is. It came on time and had it up and running  within just a few minutes of it being dropped  off at my home. This is the second one. It just stopped working but we do use it ALOT. I do now think it was problems with the remote I am going to get a new remote and have two working rokus.,5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"We had an old Roku that was in the list of ones they are ending service too, and we just signed up for Disney+, so this was a VERY affordable way to be able to do both at the same time (upgrading and being able to stream Disney Plus).We've really liked our old Roku and imagine this one will be even better.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
Got this Roku player to replace an older model that stopped working. It’s a powerful little gadget and way better than what we had. The remote even offers voice control but I’d rather not. It was easy to set up and we’re back to enjoying streaming our favorite shows. The price was very reasonable too.,5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"I got my first Roku Device 6 months ago and fell in love with them. The buffering you see from smart TV'S or other devices you wont see with Roku Streaming Devices. I plan to out a Roku in every room in my house as nd I highly recommend this product if you like streaming movies from Netflix, Hulu ect...",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"Bought this for our vacation condo, it's flawless with Plex and other local network accessed media. The problem comes when your internet stability maybe isn't the best... the Roku will glitch, stutter, and get stuck requiring a reboot if you don't want to wait 5 or so minutes for a timeout. App and menu surfing seems to drag a bit too,  I wouldn't recommend this unless you're only playing stuff from your local network media server.",2,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Easy to set up.  If you have already subscribed to TV via cable and/or streaming options, this Roku consolidates all your streaming options.  Also, it is a great value and a competitive offer when one compares it to other options available.  Allows Live streaming of major networks.  Pleased. Very Pleased!",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
It doesn't have Volume Control but easy to use and install. I needed something for my small TV to watch while lounging on the porch,5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,1
"I am very disappointed with my Roku Express. Honestly if you can spare a few more buck, go for one of the other pricier options like the Roku Premiere (at least I am assuming that it is better than this) if not just go with an Amazon Product. The Fire TV Sticks that we have are way better than this. Don't waste your money.",1,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
I was a little hesitate to purchase this Roku based on the mixed reviews. I do wish the hdmi and usb cords were longer. Setup was easy enough and I was able to bypass the screen asking for payment info my just going to my account during the signup process on my phone,4,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
Decided to cancel our cable and replace it with Roku. Worst mistake ever. Went through the hassle of setting it all up and it won't link to our account so there is no service. Wasted $30 and an hour of our time (after an exhausting day) for nothing. Oh well …live and learn. Calling the cable company back tomorrow .,1,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
I bought this so my senior parents could hook it up to their tv and watch old TV game shows from my Sling account. They are in their 60’s and not tech savvy at all. They set it up themselves in no time at all! It’s as simple as plug and (add i your account info) and play! My pro tip would be to sign up for a roku account while you’re waiting to get yours in the mail. It’ll speed things up once you get it plugged in 🙂,5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
My daughter got an update on her old Roku on YouTube  and  it shuts down in 5- 20 minutes.I bought this Express and my daughter set it up and it works .She loves Pluto TV and Youtube.She is happy.Good company and works great with my Wi Fi  and I have Comcast for this internet.😀,5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
Allows streaming video content in an easy to use format. You can use your cell phone as a remote (although the keyboard function doesn't work right on my Android phone; everything else works great). Connect to Amazon Prime for free movies and shows as well as Netflix and many other streaming services. Great for the price!,5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

I am so glad I purchased This ROKU Express HD Streaming. I have a Samsung smart TV and  I do Not experience the Buffering anymore. I have not had any Problems . I have a Disclaimer.

"Rokus are awesome. This is the second one I’ve purchased for my home. It made it easy to pull the plug on cable and switch just to streaming platforms. We mostly use it for Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video. There’s SO much you can do with a Roku though, and it is definitely user friendly and easy to figure out.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Set this up and had no CC on Prime Video. All the other channels okay. I can play some of my Prime movies on another channel, with Movies Anywhere, and have CC. I even have CC on my  Prime shows on  my Kindle tablet, just not on my TV on the Roku Prime Video channel. I spent all day with Roku and Amazon customer support and they couldn't fix it either.

"I absolutely adore my Roku and consider it to be one of the best purchases I have ever made! Extremely easy and fast to set up to the TV, add channels and use!

Not much to say other than it was easy to install and does what it's supposed to. Definitely cheaper than having to buy a new smart TV.,5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
Purchasing this Roku was the best thing I have purchased in ages. It was easy to set up and works great. I am amazed at all that we can watch with this. Enabled us to return a cable box and saves us a monthly fee. The Roku paid for itself quickly. We are considering buying more for our other TVs. Great buy!,5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"I am so glad my hairdresser recommended my Roku. It has tons of free sports channels from hunting to fishing and everything in between. I also have a les mills on demand membership and I am able to exercise in front of my TV which is a lot bigger than my tablet. Best product I've purchased so far in 2020. My hairdresser kept saying ""if you get it and don't like it just send it back"". No way I'm keeping my Roku. Set up was a breeze. Note:  You must have internet! Must have an HDMI slot on your TV.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"When my 4th Blu-ray player died I decided since the Fire Stick works so well on my second TV I would get another.  Unfortunately they were not in stock so I went with the Roku.  At less than half price of a cheap blu ray but still giving me access to everything I need I think either one, Roku or Firestick are a great item.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0

"It includes everything you need, the adapter, cables, a remote control with batteries in (note: the control is vary basic, no power nor volume buttons), even some cute stickers! I love the design, even the screen saver is very cute. I connected my roku to an old tv that was lying around my house for years, it works great and it was really easy to set up. It cost me less than $30 and now my tiny old tv plays youtube, hulu, netflix, spotify etc etc etc (including non-susbcription channels), which is a win, 'cause I'm a broke college student, it's an amazing investment and it came very quickly! I highly recommend it, especially if you're tight on money and dont wanna pay for dish or direct tv.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
I have an Apple TV and a fire stick. We then ended up receiving a older flat screen TV from a friend. The Apple TV is nice but expensive and we wanted to try something different so I bought the roku. Both my wife and I really like the user interface. The unit itself works as well as the the other two devices but it is the user interface that convinced us to buy Roku devices in the future.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0

"I bought this Roku for streaming YouTube TV.  I had no problems for the first 2 1/2 months.  In the last couple of weeks there was an update which causes severe problems with the YouTube Tv app, making it very frustrating if not unusable. It hesitates to start, freezes or goes to a black screen.  Nothing that Roku recommends corrects the problem.  The problem is not the You Tube app because there are no issues using it in my phone or tablet.  If you  intend to use this device specifically for streaming YouTube TV, find a different device.",1,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
This little device was a game changer. My cable company took Cinemax out of my package and thought I would pay 20 dollars for it separately. Boy were they wrong. I was able to get Cinemax on Roku for half the price. There is always something to watch and if you subscribe to SiriusXM they have that on the Roku as well. I also have a Hoopla account and even that is on this device. The Roku was a game changer and always gives me something to watch. I can never get bored.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"After experiencing serious buffering issues with a LG DVD player and the Fire Stick, I took one more chance on the ROKU Express. Didn't need the 4K. I haven't had a single buffer in a month. Very easy to use. Set up tip: create your account online as it's easier to bypass the credit card information request. You can add that later to make purchases, if needed.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
You can’t watch Amazon prime video with this device. Audio is waaaay out of sync. No recommended solution works. Don’t buy this if you want to watch Amazon. It works great with all other channels. Just not Amazon.,1,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
"New & smaller slimline, sleek design receiver, about 3”x 1.75” which is nice. It has a self stick base to attach it to your tv stand if you wish, so it doesn’t slide around, looks great.

"When I kept getting a message that my blu-ray would no longer get Netflix, I had to find something that would.

"I should have read the reviews before I bought! Roku Express 2019 has the WORST wifi connection ever!!! I put my 8 year old laptop right next to the Roku Express and did a speed test. Roku- 22mps , laptop 157mps. I even bought a wifi extender to plug in right next to the Roku. Useless, got it up to 32mps, but watched it degrade back down to 22mps after about a hour.  Have 3 Roku's one express, one Roku Premium, and a Roku stick. Only the stick gets 65mps + speeds, and that took me putting a separate wireless router in same room as the stick about 8ft away!!!

When trying to hook it up I entered the code that appeared on my tv screen during setup and it stated that I would have to pay $79.99 fee for use of their product. I called customer service and they said that they are charging a fee, and that this  fee came in to affect May of 2020. There is nothing on the package about a one time fee, nor is there anything in the Amazon description stating that there is an additional fee. as a matter of fact; everything states that there are no hidden fees.

"This streaming stick is one of the best ones out there. I use it all the time, and my friends love it too! It supports Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and now one of the newest streaming service Disney+.  It’s one of the best for the price and flexibility of the product. And I also love the different tiers of the roku stick and how if you want a better experience you can pay more for better features, or if you just want a simple streaming stick, theirs one out there for you too. This is one of the lower end sticks but is still great for viewing, this is better for Apple users than a android tv and chrome cast that are more centric for android devices, amazing overall!!!",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"Bought this for an older TV without smart features. Hooked up the Roku, synced with our account, and waited for the channels to install. Had to delete around a dozen channels that came pre-installed, but didn't have to add any because it brought over all the ones we were using on our other Roku TV and those logins.The strip that comes with the Roku isn't very sticky. Adhered to a flat surface on the side of the TV and fell off under its own weight within 24 hours, and I expect will no longer stick anymore. Device is so small it has to stick somewhere or it won't stay under its own weight.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

This is my first time using it and I LOVE IT! It was so easy to set up. And on the manual it even says you don’t need to subscribe or pay a fee for roku. And I got it set up easily. And hulu works!

"I'm a big fan of roku. I have a roku tv in my living room wanted a roku for the bedroom. I bought this and its perfect. Set up was easy took all of 5 minutes. Some things you should know: 1. You never actually have to point the remote at the box and it comes with an adhesive set up so you can stick it to the wall. 2. If something prompts you too pay, you're doing it wrong. You never have to pay for anything in roku unless of course you are subscribing to something. 3. You do not have to have a specific service (I.e. Netflix, Hulu, etc.) To use roku. You can use all free services. It's just a really great super user friendly streaming box.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"I say its okay device because for 2020 and the device doesnt even have a volume adjuster on it. Its a big letdown. Who wants 2 remotes, one for volume, one for streaming?

Maybe they should now after reading this review :)",3,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0

I bought this to replace my Roku 2. I've been getting messages from Roku about how new features won't work on my Roku 2. I've also been having problems with the Roku 2 locking up and having to reboot.The first thing I noticed while setting up the Roku Express was that the remote has a key bounce problem. Key bounce?

I would strongly suggest using your phone as the remote for a more robust experience.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0

Only thing I don't like is for some reason, when we're using the ROKU, my cable remote can do some of the commands the ROKU remote does.  I have to unplug the ROKU or wait a while just to use my regular remote.",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0

Love it! Purchased it for my daughters room. Didn’t want to spend on a new smart TV so this did the trick. It works well and the picture quality is great. The only down fall is that the remote control does not have a power button to turn the TV on / off and it doesn’t have a volume button either.

Only Netflix works reliably on this thing. Hulu needs to be re-registered every time it starts and fails with network errors 3 to 4 times before it works. Sling shows a black screen for any show you pick until you try starting it a few times. This is on a fiber network where other streaming devices work fine. Although I will say that Hulu is a bad streaming service on any device and fails with the weirdest errors,1,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0

"I purchased a second Roku Express for my bedroom TV.  I had to activate it separately.  When I went on Google the first thing that popped up was to add a Roku device and activation BUT I didn't realize that it was from a site other than Roku proper.  I went through the steps as they asked me to and then they came back with the statement that there is a fee for a second Roku device.  I then knew it was a scam.  I logged out and found the Roku proper site, activated the second device with no payment needed and it works beautifully!",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"Seriously though, this thing is amazing. Purchased to supplement my older model Smart TV whose app store doesn't offer Disney+. Ultimately decided to just use this exclusively in alternative to the TV's interface. It has friggin everything. Every app known to god and man. You really don't even need to use anything else. I synced my HBO, Prime Video, Netflix, Disney, Redbox, Pandora, Hulu and Apple TV accounts and it's basically cable. I love it. My kids enjoy the easy accesss of having a Disney button right on the remote. Really neat device.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0

I bought 2 of these so I could put one in the living room and one in our master. I really liked that I could mount it to the soundbar in the living room with the removable tape.

Love the roku systems. They are used friendly and simple for most people who dont understand streaming devices. They allow access to more channels than other devices like the fire TVs. Easy connection to channel subscription with cable providers (ie HBOGO works on here still with Xfinity but not on fire devices; I believe die to contact issues).Highly recommended for anyone new to streaming devices.,5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
This is probably the Roku you need for most basic setups. I don't believe it gives you the upmost capabilities of video and HD but it was perfect for a bedroom setup. There is no power button and I have found it continues using data at night when it is not being used. That makes me wonder if it is doing that during the day as well making streaming slower on other devices.,4,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
Works well. I use it with my Roku phone app for private listening when others are asleep in house. Better than using other Roku models' remote with headphone adapter....that ate through remote batteries. Like this much better.,5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0

Bought for kids room. Decided to go with this instead of the firestick because it was cheaper. Same apps. I think it is easier to navigate though. And you can customize what & where you want the apps to be. Comes with everything you need to hook it up plus very easy directions. Even has a sticker to have the actual streamer to not get lost and sit to your tv. And had a on-screen tutorial. Loved how I knew what I was doing even though I never had one because of this.

"This is a great product. Easy to install and easy to setup. If your TV has USB ports, get this product for 4K streaming at its finest. You also get access to MANY free shows. Great product, easy installation, easy setup. What could be better.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0

It keeps looping. It will ask to connect to the internet then ask for a software update that will take you so long then it will reset and do the same thing again. I tried connecting it for 5 times took me an hour or more. Buy something else. Waste of time,1,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0

"I found this to be a lower capacity device. If you dont properly exit every app when you’re done, which is not very practical, the device starts lagging. Audio gets out of sync. Only solution is to restart the device (couldn't find a way to close apps running in the background, let me know if there’s a way). I switched to a newer/better model, definitely worth the difference in price.",2,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

"I had a weird and frustrating experience setting up this thing. During initial phase, after choosing language, the HDMI channel keep changing as soon as I press the ok button. Afterwards, it scan for network. Out of the box, this thing is crap!!! It will not allow to give me a chance to enter the Roku device  password and keeps cycling back to scan network. I had Roku for years and my older one crashed few days ago. Bought a new one, and still had a frustrating experience just with set up. I have Xfinity wifi which I connect all my previous Roku. My other device worked with Xfinity wifi, but recently the Roku kept acting up when I connect. Roku customer service is non existent even if you have a Roku account for years. I'm done with these streaming devices. I'm getting by connecting my Chromebook to hdmi and watch on my big screen TV whatever I'm watching on my laptop, old fashion way.",1,0,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Activation should have been easy but I mistakenly tried to use a credit  card I thought I had activated but according to the bank I didn't.  When I used the live chat at the roku activation  site to get help, the rep rapidly sent long litinies pushing 3 kinds of upgrades.  She typed so fast and the screen moved before i had time to read.  After I told her I wasn't interested in any upgrade, she left our chat without giving me any help.  However I was able to activate once I used a valid credit card without any hickuop.Now the product itself.  Roku has lots of chanels and shows.  More than enough for an average TV watcher like me. It's HD quality  is excellent.  My Samsung smart TV never looked this good.  Navigation has been easy.",5,0,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"I have 2 Samsung Smart Tvs that are a few years old.  After a while Samsung stopped supporting alot of the apps and little by little deleted them from their interface.  In addition alot of the new apps don't work well with Samsung's interface.  A Customer Svc Rep for one of the apps that I called for assistance recommended Roku and I ended up buying a kit for each TV.  Very easy to set up, easy to add apps and easy to use.  There is NO SETUP FEE. Whoever wrote that in their review is lying.  In addition to apps that you need to pay a monthly fee for, there are also several apps that offer free programming with commercials.  Ive used streamers before there were smart tvs, and Roku is by far the best Ive ever used.  Highly recommend it to turn your older smart tv into a smarter device.",5,0,2020-6-12,1,0,0

"Before you buy another Roku product please investigate the failure of both their Engineering and Customer Service departments.Roku customers have frequently received faulty software updates and customer service is usually unable or unwilling to help.

"It's easy to just buy the cheapest Roku, figuring who needs lots of extras. In the past I've bought one or two up from the cheapest. Then Roku sent me an email offer, my current device was about to be obsolete, take them now up on a limited time offer of a new device for only $15. No details. Dear reader, I was foolish and took it.The old device had an on-off button to control the TV, and a volume control as well. This cheapo has neither.

"I got this specifically for Disney+ since it isn't on my ""Smart"" TV.  Figured it was a logical move.  It was working great until 5-10 minutes into any show it loses it's Internet connection.

"ROKU worked great until recent firmware update. Now there is a HDCP HDMI incompatiblity error for about 20 seconds before watching content, and when it eventually plays the content there is crackling in the audio. Of course I checked the cable and TV with my BluRay Player, and everything works fine there. I bought different HDMI cable too. There is no solution provided, but unplugging all cables, and restarting. That didn't work. On their website they say that one has to have a HDCP compatible device. Granted my TV is 15 years old, that is probably the issue. If they are pushing people to buy new TVs, that would be a good reason for a bad review. You may have different information, but for now I need to leave a bad review.UPDATE: I have bought HDMI switch, which solved this problem.... I just don't think most people will figure it out, unless they do some research.",1,0,2019-12-31,1,0,0

You never can speak or even have a chat on a chat box with an actually person.  Everything are bots.  I have 3 of these and my TV will not stream Hulu consistently for 5 minutes.

So it's worthless for that purpose and that was all she cared about. Be Aware!

Now we can stream Netflix, Prime, YouTube, Hulu, and Disney+. We ended up signing up for another streaming service (Spectrum TV) and this worked super well with it  - we just had to download the app which took all of 20 seconds. Apparently Fire TV will not allow users to access the Spectrum app, so the Roku was a much better choice for our needs. One thing - this little box must have a direct line to the remote or it won't read it. Be sure to position it where you can get the remote pointed right at the box.",5,0,2020-1-2,1,0,0

"We've had two Rokus in use since 2012, back when we gave up cable. Even though the boxes were a little laggy against 2019 software, they were still solid and I would have kept using them if support wasn't being phased out before the end of the year, per tech sites, and a reminder email from Roku itself. Additionally, the new Disney+ app wouldn't load; another sign to upgrade our heavily used Rokus to something with the latest Roku OS. I purchased two Express boxes, released in September (3930R). They're a perfect resolution match for our TVs, which are both 1080p. It's worth reading through the specs to avoid surprises: single band wireless, not a voice controlled remote, maximum output resolution is 1080p. All fine for our use--in fact, they were very much like the old boxes we were perfectly happy with, but now able to get the latest software updates. These new Rokus feel snappy--in and of themselves, I think, and because we'd been using 7 year old hardware!

It's like the WiFi antenna in it just broke.",1,0,2019-12-30,1,0,0
Disappointed in this device and for one reason only... The remote does not work with TV volume and power on and off... The firestick does and it's at the same price point so roku needs to step their game up because besides that this thing works great even with the subpar hardware I have no issues.

Had to replace the previous method for streaming using my Blueray payer when the NETFLIX software was no longer supported or allowed by Netflix. The installation was easy with everything working the first time around. My main complaint is that the iPad app that I had to install to set up the device only displays in the vertical direction (page view) and not in the horizontal direction (newspaper style) which is extremely annoying since most apps automatically shift back and forth. I use a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad and the horizontal mode is the only way to type and read the text at the same time. Unsatisfactory!,4,0,2019-12-23,1,0,0

"Purchased this updated express model because Apple TV/TV Plus is, for some reason, not available on my 3 y/o 4K TV with Roku and a 3 y/o express device and also because I wanna be able to see the above app's contents on my TV sets without having to plug in my iPhones, iPads or MacBook Pro...and Lord knows I ain't gonna spend on the overpriced Apple TV box. I must say this doesn't disappoint for the above reason and also because this feels a lot snappier and produces better picture than my old express device. Setup is as easy as ever without any hiccups.Definitely highly recommended for cord cutters, future cord cutters and those like me who have all their TV/movie entertainment online.",5,0,2019-11-15,1,4,1
BUYER BEWARE! ROKU as of 9/1/19 (according to the tech guy) now charges $59.99 for a 5 year license fee or $99.99 for a life time license fee. They will not activate your device unless you pay the fee,1,0,2019-10-19,1,7,0
"Personally, the way the world has been coming lately, more of us have been forced to stay at home with creature comforts. We as a country have stopped eating out, going to work because of the coronavirus, and felt more suppressed with self-doubt and hurt. But there are always things to watch on television or the internet, rather than just about depressing news. For that, it is more important now than ever to purchase a streaming device. I have used both Amazon's and Roku's streaming devices for years, but made the decision to go back to Roku, because of the convenience & quality. If you're into streaming online for the first time, you'll find a expressway to your boredom with this.The Roku Express+ Media Player is a simple and straight-forward way to connect you to streaming online, playing music and media for the first time, without problems. It is very easy to connect, small and compact. It is a plug & play device that works flawlessly with my TV while I watch my favorite services online like CBS All Access, popcorn flix and more recent entries like CBS All Access and HBO Now. The interface is easy to hookup, and works with any HDTV. Yet, there are a few faults here. For one, it doesn't work with the RCA audio/video hookup anymore, like the way it used to from the earlier Roku device. Also, you cannot have a way to burn your media onto another media recorder like a DVD recorder or VCR if you still have cassette tapes. So for those problems, you may have to result in purchasing other media players from Roku, or you may have to consider purchasing a converter box if you need to.",4,0,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"This is an inexpensive option for cord-cutters (kind of an oxymoron since it still has cords) i.e., those who are looking to ditch cable or satellite tv. It is basically a box that attaches to your tv via an HDMI cable, and then allows you to download various apps, some free, some paid (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Sling TV, YouTube TV, etc.) through which you can watch TV or movies.The setup is easy. You just plug the Roku box into one of the HDMI ports on your TV, then connect it via a USB cable to a power source, which can be either through a USB port in the TV or connect the USB end of the cable into a power adapter that plugs into a regular wall outlet. Then you just follow the on-screen prompts to set it up, which will include connecting to your home's wireless network, telling it what you like to watch so it can suggest apps to download, and either setting up or logging into your Roku account (if you have an account set up).",5,0,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"I already have an account with Sling and bought one of these devices (not from Amazon) hoping to free up my tablet for other uses. At the end of the quick setup booklet, it says that you have to setup a Roku account and give them a credit card for billing! Sling already bills me directly, so why would Roku demand a credit card from me? For what reason? That is totally stupid !! Roku's website FAQ's dont even address this issue and dont give you an email address to ask this question. 99.9% of FAQ's, and Roku is no exception here, only address lame questions like: Why doesnt the device change channels when I point the remote at my dog, but changes channels when I point it at my cat ?Never, Ever, once in the past 20yrs have I ever been able to find an answer to a question in the FAQ's !",1,0,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"I own 3 of these now.  I first bought one for my TV that I hadn't used in 7 years but I dusted off because of COVID-19 but I didn't like the tinny sound from the speakers so I upgraded to a Roku Sound Bar and gave this one to my mother.It is simple, easy-to-use and has endless options for entertainment.  There are so many channels available it boggles the mind and the entertainment is endless but there simply just isn't enough time in the day to view everything that is available on all the channels you could possibly watch!  Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney, HBO, CBS, Apple TV, man oh man alive it goes on and on and on plus all the specialty channels... I don't know what else to say.  The quality of the picture is top-notch on any modern TV and you only need to upgrade to a better Roku if you have a 4K TV, otherwise this is just fine for most people's needs.",5,0,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"When I first bought the Roku Express it worked great - the remote that comes included was snappy, has convenient shortcut buttons to streaming services I use, and could be programmed to control basic functions of my TV like power and volume.  Similarly, streaming quality was great, the user interface was simple and effective, and all around it was a great product.Fast forward to 3-4 months shy of 2 years later however and the dependability/quality of the Roku has dropped significantly.  Beginning a few months ago the remote began not always registering roku-specfic actions for a short while after powering on the TV/Roku (things like navigation, 'Ok', 'play/pause', etc.) - I would have to wait a minute or two for the remote to begin working. It wasn't a huge deal since Roku also has an accompanying app that serves as a virtual remote control I could fall back on.",2,0,2020-8-4,1,0,0

"The Roku Express is a decent streaming device that might satisfy your needs.  It is cheap (found last year's model on sale for only $17!) and the Roku user interface is great.  Easy to setup.  Some limitations to keep in mind: this is a 1080p device, so not for 4k TV's.  Also, it only operates on the 2.4 ghz wifi network.  If you live in apartments with lots of competing wifi networks good luck getting a steady signal.  The hardware in the express is not great at picking up wifi at a distance in comparison with other wifi devices like iPads or smartphones.  One more limitation that affects all Rokus (not just the express) is that most of the content is not in 5.1 surround sound.  Vudu and Amazon have 5.1 surround, but other popular favorites like Pluto TV, the Roku Channel, and Sony Crackle do not.  Overall, I think Amazon reviewers have overrated the Express.  The average user would be better off with the Streaming Stick Plus.  The latter has 4k and 5 ghz wifi support along with a better remote.  It is about twice the price though.",3,0,2020-1-31,1,0,0

"We love our Roku Express and purchasing it through Amazon has been 💯better than from a box store! We had one before but it burned up in a wild fire along with everything else we all owned. Finally we decided to purchase another one, and it was 10$ cheaper than how much it would have cost us at the store. It came quickly as usual with our Prime! No complaints there! We were just using the Xbox to stream but that becomes a pain after a while. Roku is so much better and all the apps are up to date, so even if your TV is older and NOT SMART you can easily add the ROKU EXPRESS and stream pretty much anything you want! Hulu my personal favorite or Netflix etc. We Also use other apps like WWE Network through our Roku as well. I’m not even sure I even know all of the apps that it comes with. I do know there also is a bunch of free channels it has preloaded on the box too. I don’t watch a ton of TV so I don’t really know all of it’s capabilities, I just know it works well and doesn’t glitch out and the picture is super clear. The remote is tiny, I loose it all the time, but it works so it’s fine. I want to say there is a phone app you can download to use as a remote but then again I’m not completely 💯sure. No issues with buffering or lagging either. It’s really easy to figure out too. Definitely recommend this streaming device to anyone looking for a quality product for a reasonable price, all you need is an internet connection and a TV of course and you will be good to go!",5,1,2020-2-29,1,1,0
"I've seen some people in the reviews saying that they had to pay again once they bought it, and they are wrong, at least according to my experience. This device is literally plug and play. Once you plug it in, you're greeted with a screen that tells you to log in and basically just set everything up. Once that is done, get ready for probably the best tv experience you'll ever have. The remote is quick and snappy, the user interface is fantastic (10/10). Overall, Roku really nailed it on everything from hardware to the user experience.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0

"My old refurbished roku stick crapped out after years of faithful service. Needed a cheap replacement, and this roku came to save the day. I dont notice any difference except the little box that sits or sticks next to your TV.  I dont really care about how an extra box looks, i just wanted something cheaper. Some people might not like the extra little box if they are used to the tiny usb stick that is not noticeable. I couldn't care less.There are probably other differences that i don't care about, so if you really care about that stuff you may want to look up the technical differences.  I do like that the remote has the Disney+ and Hulu buttons in addition to the Netflix button. My wish would be if you could choose your own app buttons, but again, im not picky.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,1
"I bought a new Roku Express through Amazon. I was able to step through all of the initial setup without an issue. The next time I tried to use it, it wouldn't connect. I brought it down to another TV only 16 feet from my Router and it still wouldn't connect. I went painstakingly through the troubleshooting procedures with Amazon and they agreed that it was not connecting due to a malfunction. They shipped me a new one that arrived the next day.The new Express connected immediately to my wifi. It then started to update. The device restarted to the Roku splash screen a couple times. Then, when the device started back up after a very long time, it was back at the first setup screen asking me to select a language, then asking for the WiFi and password, though this time the WiFi password was filled in (though masked). When I clicked through to connect it threw a 014.40 error and failed.",1,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

"this is a great device if you don't want to spend a lot of money on other products BUT it is THE BEST! quality, installation and the amount of app channels you can add .... hulu, crave, netflix, apple tv, disney plus... lots of streaming free cooking channels and sports channels with a subscription. You got everything on this tiny thing. Only thing is the remote doesn't have a volume setup, which my other Roku has because it came with the TV. we are very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2020-7-21,0,1,0
"Me encantó, jamás había usado Roku y es súper fácil, me gusta más incluso que los sistemas que traen las pantallas inteligentes. El control trae accesos directos a servicios de Streaming, pero en Mexico solo podemos usar Netflix, trae uno de Disney Plus y ya espero que llegue para poder usarlo.",5,1,2020-7-20,0,1,0
"Compre este Roku porque mi TV es ya viejita y por el precio te llevas muy buen equipo, no me gusta el control que traer porque sus atajos son malos pero fuera de eso cumple con su función de dar la definición 1080, te aconsejo conectarlo vía USB porque no tiene botón de Power y se apaga y prende cuando enciendes o apagas la TV",4,1,2020-7-27,0,1,0
"Excelente, muy buen dispositivo. Muy intuitivo y fácil de instalar, además me gusta que es un dispositivo totalmente independiente, lo puedes controlar con el celular o sin el.Aunque un detalle importante es que si el control se pierde y cambias tu contraseña o algo parecido no hay manera de configurarlo y los controles no se venden por separado, pero sin duda vale lo que cuesta",4,1,2020-8-7,0,0,1
"A diferencia del first tv este no detecta tu tv por lo tanto tienes que usar forzosamente elControl de tu televisión para apagar y encender así como para subir o bajar volumen  , es muchisimo más lento para adelantar o cambiar de app  tiene problemas de calidad de imagen si estoy ocupando videollamada en otro equipo .

"Excelente precio, la entrega se realizó casi 10 días antes de lo indicado al momento de la compra, los equipos llegaron sin daños, el único detalle es que se dañaron los empaques de los productos, probablemente colocaron algo pesado encima durante su transporte (Estafeta) ya que venían dentro de un sobre de papel, me parece que sería mejor que los enviaran dentro de una caja de cartón para protegerlos mejor de algún daño.",4,1,2020-7-9,0,0,1
"Esta pequeñito jajaNo ocupa prácticamente nada de espacio, tiene una tira para pegarlo donde se te de la gana, de preferencia de frente para que el control remoto ya incluido lo detecte y cerca de la Tv por que el cable HDMI incluido es un poco corto.",5,1,2020-7-6,0,0,0
"Después de varios meses de uso, si me atrevo a recomendarlo, yo creo que no ya que de pronto sin avisar el sistema como que se resetea y se apaga y prende sólo cuando uno está escogiendo un canal o algo para ver o escuchar, la opción de estos aparatos es para tvs que no son smarts por que tampoco funciona también como espejo",3,1,2020-9-2,0,0,0

I have had roku before but now the tell you to call an 888 number cause there's a error and when you call the number they tell you its 100 dollars 💵 to set it up for life I thought roku was free then you pay for the subscription,1,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Ordered a Roku Express, and it worked well initially, but then failed and needed to be replaced.  That happens, so just unlucky, but thats where the real headaches begin.  You can't call Roku support during the pandemic.  Not sure why, but thats how they are operating.  They dont provide a quick and easy way to chat or email them from their support website, and they make it very difficult to contact them and to determine how to deal with a defective product.  Eventually, I logged in on the support site, and there we finally found a way to tell the about our defective unit.  They responded with an email saying they will replace it, shipping out a new one when they receive the defective one, but they dont include a shipping address.  The email contains a link to an article on their website which also doesnt provide a shipping address.  Followed up with another email to Roku, and they said they would forward our email to another department to get us a shipping address.  We are still going through this back and forth with them.  I havent seen such terrible product support in a very long time.  Its almost as if they are trying to make it as difficult as possible for you to deal with a defective product.  So, great product as long as you dont get a defect, then the support really is awful.",2,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"Excelente opción para convertir un tv viejo en smart tv, o para actualizar prime y betflix en televisores que no permiten bajar las nuevas versiones.
