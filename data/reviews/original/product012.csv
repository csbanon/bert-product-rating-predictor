"I'm constantly telling people/family to stop buying cables from the box stores as they're just too expensive, to stop wasting their money.  As a former sales person of stereo equipment we were always told to ""push new cables on new purchases"", and for good reason.  I think the markup on cables and such might surpass jewelry!!  It's just horrible.  So stop buying those overpriced cables and buy them here on Amazon, or at a couple of other online retailers, for much, MUCH less.  They work just as well as the name brand cables, just without the fancy colors, or the fancy labels.  But hey, if you've got one of those unlimited budgets and money is no object, then go ahead and buy that $100+ per foot, 4 gauge speaker cable, or other severely overpriced interconnects.",5,1,2018-1-29,1,5,0
"2017 SepOriginally I put 5 stars, because it worked fine after installation. However about 6 months, I started to observe issue that the video image blacked out intermittently. I was not able to find the root cause, because the issue was intermittent, but recently I completely lost the image, and I identified that root cause is this HDMI cable. After I replaced the cable with another one, the image was recovered and didn't show any intermittent issue.",1,1,2017-1-5,1,4,0
"I am going to keep this review short and sweet. I saw many reviews referencing these cables not being able to handle 4K HDR or support 4:4:4 chroma at 60Hz. While I cannot speak for the configurations of other users, I can confirm the following:Using this cable on a Samsung KS8500, I can confirm that this cable supports:",5,1,2016-9-18,1,1,1
We had bought a new TiVo and a new TV and for the lif of ours we could not pinpoint which one was malfunctioning when the sound would dip during different times of viewing.  Turns out these HDMI cables are the problem!!!! … You have no idea how much time I spent trying to troubleshoot the poor new devices.  For having put through what I have gone thru I would rate these as garbage!!! Grrrrr!!!,1,1,2018-6-30,1,2,0
Amazing cables at an affordable price. Tested with 4K HDR and Dolby Vision. Works with Apple TV too. I have this HDMI cable going from my Denon AV receiver to my LG OLED TV and all my devices hooked to my AV receiver using this HDMI cable as well. Everything works great. Don't listen to the reviews that said Dolby Vision doesn't work on the Apple TV. They probably didn't set up their AV receiver and TV settings properly. The TV and the AV receiver has a setting that is listed as HDMI Deep Color or HDMI Enhanced that you will need to enable for HDR and Dolby Vision. Also it is prefered to set up the match settings under the video settings for the Apple TV.,5,1,2018-3-17,1,1,0
"Updating my review, I bought this 3 pack and while the first cable worked fine on 4K 60fps signals, the second and third cables has major issues.I had bought these to replace my older AmazonBasics high speed cables (10.2Gbps), however after purchasing a XBOX One X, those cables would not allow the XBOX to work in 4K. I had a similar issue with my Roku Ultra which would not work with the 4K 60fps setting. I decided to try these as they are rated at 18Gbps. While the first cable I tried worked flawlessly (no artifacts, flickering or other issues), the other two did not work as well. I tried Twisted Veins HDMI cables as well and had similar issues. I finally picked up Monoprice cables and haven't had any problems. Most people have good luck with these cables in shorter lengths (6ft or less), however at 10ft or longer I recommend looking for something else if you are using these on a 4K display. The two issues I saw with these cables at 4K 60fps were sparkles or repeating signal loss.",3,1,2017-11-23,1,2,0
"Please do not waste your hard earned money on overpriced HDMI cables in the name of picture or sound improvements. I currently am using these AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cables to connect our Yamaha v379 AV receiver to other HDMI enabled devices that link back to our 4K Samsung Smart TV and these have performed flawlessly.HDMI cables come in four types: Standard-speed --> Standard-speed with Ethernet --> High-speed --> High-speed with Ethernet. Since High-speed cables are so cheap (e.g these AmazonBasics cables), there really isn't any point of getting Standard-speed anymore. On the other hand, as most HDMI devices today can't receive Ethernet over HDMI, High-speed HDMI cables are really all you need.",5,1,2016-1-18,1,2,1
"I went through 3 other HDMI cables before finally just deciding to buy this one, All other 3 cables I used previously were all from other highly rated brands here on Amazon, all them claimed to support HDMI 2.0 4K @60Hz. And you can guess those claims fell flat and they did not work whatsoever, Most of those other cables would have no image to the TV when selecting HDMI 2.0 mode and also there was horrendous screen tearing eve though v-sync was enabled in the games I was playing on my PC.Well I am happy to report this is the very first cable I got that finally works as advertised. It can fully transmit a 4K 60Hz image over a 25 foot cable with no signal loss whatsoever. It even fully supports chroma 4:4:4 like a charm. This cable is an absolute beast and I cant believe how cheap it is. The other cables I got that didnt work were all over $60 and this $12 Amazon cable beats it in every way, I am a true believer in the Amazon basics brand for life now.",5,1,2018-12-3,1,8,1
"SO long. I never thought about how long 25 ft really was until I had it laid out in my living room! Great cable though, no issues whatsoever ever! The only concern I really have is that the cable cord is thick, a lot thicker than your standard HDMI cable. So for planning purposes this is important to note. I mounted my TV on my wall and used to cord/cable covers to maintain the wires. I was barely able to fit the TV power cable and the HDMI cord in the cover but I got it eventually. The cable works great just understand 25 ft is A LOT of cable and the cable runs a little thicker than your typical HDMI.",4,1,2017-7-2,1,1,0
"After reading reviews here to confirm that these cables are 4K HDR10 capable, I ordered a set of three to run in the wall between various devices and a new LG 4K tv.  They work fine with regular HD devices, but connected to an Xbox watching 4K Netflix, they fail within a few seconds every time.  It'll show a few seconds of the video, flicker to static for a second, or show noise patterns, then go blank.  Switching back to the HDMI cable that came with the Xbox works flawlessly.  All three cables exhibit this problem, so this doesn't seem to be a one-off issue.The Xbox renders all its menus and other output at 4K all the time, but the only time the cables fail is when Netflix enables HDR10 (the tv shows a little HDR badge in the corner when this happens), so I'm assuming the incompatibility is with HDR10.",1,1,2017-8-28,1,1,0
"When I had this cable stretched to it's 25 foot length in use it performed as described with no issues.  4K HDR @ 60 was achieved with zero issues.  I rearranged my setup and cut the distance to roughly 1/2.  Since the cable proved it's worth I simple made large loops in the cable to take up the slack and not put excessive bend strain onto the cable.  I started to get graphical glitches, cut out, and full signal lose for seconds at a time randomly.Due to the quality external construction, this is a THICK cable, I wonder if even with large loops placed in the cable it create signal interference that messed with the signal.  I usually buy cable longer than I need for changes in room furniture but due to the affordable prices and quality of the Amazon Basic cables I'd recommend trying to have multiple lengths that are the right length for your applications.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"Bottom Line,  These cables do not support HDCP so you will NOT get the dialogue track, only the sound track associated with the video stream, making for some very interesting streaming of movies... LOL.I recently ordered, installed new HDMI cables to support 4K in my home theater system.  The thing about 4K is that all the devices and cables from content provider to display must be 4K compatible or the digital content drops to the least common denominator in the path.",1,1,2018-11-9,1,5,0
"So the video signal from my blu ray player started to occasionally break up and the player is over 6 years old so I worried it might need to be replaced.  But then I quickly though to check the hdmi cable first.  The cable being used was an AmazonBasics High-Speed cable same as this and I checked my orders and it was almost 7 years old!  Boy, that was a good amount of quality use to get from the cable.  I quickly ordered the now of course greatly updated High-Speed HDMI cable and right away blu ray player has been fine and the picture quality also improved.  I am always so thankful to get such amazing quality at such a great price.  Highly recommend this cable.",5,1,2018-8-8,1,3,0
"I bought 4 of these and all of them are bad. Tried using with an Xbox One X and am unable to consistently get video. Screen constantly goes black every few seconds making them basically useless.At first I thought the issue might be the Xbox or the TV (TV is brand new Samsung QLED). Ended up digging up an older (2014) AmazonBasics HDMI cable intended only for 1080p display, and surprisingly am getting 4k just fine without the screen constantly flashing off. Switching back to one of the other cables and the flashes of black immediately return, so I'm confident that these newer cables just suck.",1,1,2019-3-31,1,2,0
Rip off I think the one that I have have a shortage in it maybe even used not brand new I purchase I should get a replacement for this because I have to get up and take the cord  out and place it back  in order to get a picture on the TV might have to go to the store and buy another,1,1,2017-5-22,1,8,0
"Unfortunately this cable did not work as advertised. I purchased the 50’ length to extend from my TV to my AVR. I require the latest tech to support  4K HDR10 signal from an X Box One S. This cable did not support HDMI 2.0 and was unable to transmit any signal from the XBox when set to 4K output. While troubleshooting I tried to hook up a 4K Roku Premium and the Roku said it was not compatible with 4K. The highest output available on the Roku using this cable was 1080.Given the specs listed on the cable, this should have worked for both the Roku and the Xbox. If it was just the Xbox being incapable of HDR10, I wouldn’t fault this cable too much. As yet The only cable I have found capable of pushing an HDR10 signal from the XBox was the one that came with the XBox. But the inability to send a 4K signal at all is inexcusable.",1,1,2018-12-7,1,4,0
"EXTREMELY STURDY CABLEI am pleasantly surprised by the bulk thickness of this cable, it could last longer than the items it connects.",4,1,2017-12-14,1,5,0
"I have an Apple TV 4K that I connected to my Onkyo receiver and then to my Sony 930 TV. The Dolby Vision was not working this route on the HDMI ARC ports (2&3). I went to best buy and got a $30 18 GB per second cable and got the same results. I had to go into the input settings of the TV and turn on the HDR there. Not in the picture settings, but the port themselves. Then, these cables with Dolby Vision and ATMOS work beautifully. See instructions belowIf you connect a device that needs to use the full HDMI bandwidth, like a UHD Blu-ray player, a video game console or a PC set to output at 4k 60p 4:2:0 10 bit, 4:4:4 or 4:2:2, you'll need to connect them via the HDMI port 2 or 3 and set the 'HDMI signal format' to 'Enhanced format', via the 'External inputs' setting pages",5,1,2019-1-29,1,2,0
"This is probably the most disappointed I've been in an Amazon product.  I've bought 11 of these cables, and they were fine for 4K60 HDR 10.  But I've had trouble with dolby HDR, specifically with an Apple TV 4K.  I'd also been unable to enable HDR on a Windows 10 htpc.  I spent hours troubleshooting over the months, when the only problem was these cables.  With the Apple TV I'd get random black screens and a note once, stating that my cable or TV could not support the resolution.On an Audio Video forum, I read about other people's problems similar to mine, and ended up buying monoprice premium cables.  Problem solved.  I dont know if this is a quality control issue, because these cables per their specs, should have no problems with any 4K resolution.",1,1,2018-12-2,1,4,0
"So I always though that HDMI cables were all the same. I was wrong. Although these cables are marked high speed they did not work in my setup. I have a Vizio M65-E0 TV, Onkyo TX-NR575 Receiver, Apple TV 4k and Xbox One S. With these cables hooked up my Xbox One S would not recognize my TV as being 4k HDR  and the Apple TV 4k would not allow Dolby Vision. The receiver can pass HDR and Dolby Vision and my TV is capable of both as well. I also had issues displaying anything from the Xbox that was not 1080p such as DVDs etc. I was very frustrated and spent hours swapping settings and resetting all my gear. I finally decided to try some different cables. I purchased the Monoprice Certified cables also available on Amazon. Voila, everything was perfect. If you are looking to get 4k HDR or Dolby Vision out of your home theater setup passing through a receiver, I would recommend you steer clear of these cables and get the Monoprice Certified. They are only a few dollars more and much higher quality.",1,1,2018-3-14,1,7,0
"I just bought a very nice Sony 4k television from Best Buy in Alpharetta, Ga. I bought a stand, 4k DVD player, Marantz amplifier and two HMDI 2.2 cables from the Magnolia side of the store. When i looked at my receipt later, I was amazed to see that I had paid $130 for an 8 foot HMDI cable and $100 for a 6 footer- plus 7.5% tax. The cables had silver wire in them and were supposed to deliver great sound. I have excellent hearing, and the sound quality of these inexpensive cables is almost the same. Most people would never know the difference. Satisfied? You Betcha! I returned the expensive cables and walked out with the $246 I had paid Best Buy. 3 of these cost about $12.",5,1,2018-9-3,1,4,0
"I've been using Amazon's HDMI cables for several years now. I use them alongside a few other brands. There's a few areas where these shine and others where they fall short.For reference, I do not have 4k so I cannot speak to how these work for 4k content/tvs.",4,1,2018-9-12,1,4,0
"Folks, it's an HDMI cable.  It sends a digital signal to and from the devices you connect with it.  A digital signal is all-or-nothing:  it either works as well as it can, or it doesn't work at all.  Do not be fooled by expensive cables which claim to carry a better signal:  that's just what George Carlin described as ""Advertising Lullaby.""  It's not worth more money from your bank account to pay for benefits that do not exist.  This cable really is every bit as good as cables which cost several times more.  No, it is.  Really.So buy this, save money, and hook up.  You'll get exactly the same image quality, and will have money left over for snacks.  Enjoy!",5,1,2018-3-18,1,5,0
"All three cables did not work with such devices as PS4 or Roku but found no issues with my laptop and second monitor. Will return as the primary reason for the purchase was to replace two of the three cables we have already and keep a third as a spare but since only one works with one device, might as well spend the extra money and purchase three of quality cables that will work among all devices in our household.",1,1,2017-11-12,1,5,0
"Roku's been around for many years making great products so I won't go too deeply into its functionality (it's awesome!) but I do want to share why I bought it and how i use it primarily.I've only owned chromecasts in the past but as part of my job, I travel very often and stay at hotels for the majority of the week. If you're not aware, hotels often require you to log into the wi-fi network typically with your name and room number and chromecasts do not support these types of logins (since it doesn't have a controllable UI - even on it's companion apps!!) so odds are you won't be able to connect chromecasts to the network.",5,1,2018-9-29,1,2,1
"Bought this as an amazon warehouse deal (generally a pretty good buy) and have not been disappointed.  The cable is built sturdy but not too thick that moving it around objects becomes cumbersome.  I use it to stream my Mac to my TV in order watch live streaming games etc.  What i'll say is that the mac allows the user to optimize the ouput for tv or computer, and when put on the tv setting the picture is as clear if not better than the computer. I purchased the 15 foot cable and some have indicated that at lengths over 10 feet there is distortion etc, though i have experienced none of this and there is no perceivable delay in sound or picture or quality from the cable. To note however, i'm also running it from a lightening port in the computer, through a converter to HDMI which, one would think would increase the delay and decrease the quality, though as mentioned, no issue as of yet.Five stars and highly recommended as with all amazon products",5,1,2018-10-10,1,2,0
"Previously I was only using the passthru hdmi on my receiver, as people were saying the tv would do better up scaling on its own. However, I tried recently and the 2160p processing from Receiver is definitely better. I am guess the tv is only doing a basic line doubling algorithm and not as good as the chipset in the Onkyo receiver. I used a thumbnail on the movie menu from Apple TV menu for The Scorch Trials. The upscaled was much less grainy and slightly brighter. After some minutes however, the picture would shake, flash and get progressively worse until I switch back to 1080p or passthru modeI tried 5 cables, all of which said there were high speed and one that said high speed with Ethernet. All failed quickly as soon as I tried 4K processing",5,1,2016-9-28,1,1,0
"Working as intended. ran it around the baseboards across the room. Did this so i can have my tower by me but the t.v. on the other side without having a cable to trip over. More then enough length. Cable was stiff at first from being so thick and wound so tight. it didn't seem to do any damage though and works very well, sound and video is crisp and clear.Post Statement~",5,1,2018-5-26,1,4,0
"I bought these cables to connect my PC (with GTX 980Ti)to my 4K TV (LG UH7700). The only color settings that work with this cable is YCbCr 420 at 8bpc. It doesn't support anything above YCbCr420 at 4k. The moment I change to 422 or 444, I get a flickering black screen with random white dots like static or something. I have confirmed it by connecting my notebook (with GTX 1070) using this cable and the issue is the same. I had another brand new shorter HDMI cable lying around which was never used so I tried that and all color settings worked like a charm. So the fault is with these AmazonBasics cable.",1,1,2016-9-9,1,6,0
"Purchased these to use with the apple lightening adaptor to connect the hubby' iPad to the tv.  He wanted the capability to watch Amazon, Netflix and other videos on his not smart tv and this cord and the adaptor worked perfectly.  Videos loaded immediately -much quicker than through the wifi connected blue ray player.  All we had to do was connect everything, turn o. The tv and select the source and we were up and running.  We connected the iPad to the smart tv in the living room and enjoyed watching a movie on the larger screen.  Can't beat the price for the twin pack.  I have the 2nd one plugged into the living room tv so we can quickly connect the iPad.  The 10' cable ended up being a little too short to be permanently attached to the bedroom tv - the cord was out in the open for the cat to play with.  I remedied that by ordering the 15' cable which I received today.  Hooked it up and it is out of the way!  I highly recommend these cables.  They work perfectly and you can't beat the price.",5,1,2017-6-5,1,6,0
"I ordered a 3 pack of the AmazonBasics “High Speed” HDMI Cables, 10 ft. Upon receiving, I plugged in my Xbox One X with the new cable, but nothing displayed. After troubleshooting, I determined it was the cable. The cable would pass 1080p signal, but when changed to 4K from the Xbox One X, it would no longer display.Of the box of 3, 1 HDMI cable properly displayed the 4K HDR content. I called Amazon and they sent me out a replacement set of 3. When I tested these 3 cables, NONE of them worked.",1,1,2019-2-24,1,1,0
"I purchased this cable primarily to use during a Windows 10 pro upgrade on a Windows 7 Pro Box.  It's a headless client and in day to day ops, I just RDP to it.  RDP will present some issues during the upgrade if a monitor isn't directly attached and that was my goal in getting this cable.  I tried for an hour on a known good HDMI port on my 1080 TV.  Nada.  It wouldn't pick up that anything was connected.  Figuring it might be my Windows 7 box, I updated drivers, etc. to no avail.  I then figured let me use a known good HDMI cable from my Roku, ran that to another working TV and expected it not to work as I thought the problem was my Windows 7 box but bam, instant success.  I know a lot of people have had good luck with this cable but I got a lemon.  By the way, I have purchased many great HDMI Amazon Basic cables over the years with much luck but my hope here was to get the 25 footer and then leave it run in case I ever needed to boot off USB, etc. and use my primary monitor.  Oh well.  I'm skeptical to try another after this.  Very thick and heavy cable, too, by the way.",1,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0

I bought this for my mom actually. She's been wanting to watch videos from her laptop onto our new 4K TV.I bought this for $7.99 on March 29. My dad requested that I buy this using my Student trial since everywhere else sells HDMI cables of equivalent length for at least $20. 10 ft was the perfect length for them. It's long enough to extend from the coffee table to the TV.,5,1,2017-7-26,1,2,1
"Please be aware of how thick these are before buying! They are three times as thick as normal HDMI cords. It is not flexible near the ends and weighs a lot. It puts way too much weight and stress on the HDMI ports on your devices, breaking the port. My ports are now wobbly because of all the stress this put on them. As soon as you plug it in and let go of the cord, you can see the port and end of the cord move down a ton from the weight and stress of the inflexibility, and becomes a loose port leading to issues. Way to thick!",1,1,2018-11-5,1,1,0
"I purchased this cable to connect my laptop to an external monitor while creating a home workstation for the pandemic. Although it worked as advertised initially, I prefer to put my laptop away at the end of each day, which involves disconnecting the HDMI cable. Within a few weeks, I noticed that the display on my monitor was prone to strange color shifts and pixelation, which went away when I pinched or adjusted the HDMI plug at its connection to my laptop. Switching the orientation of the cable (so that I'm unplugging and replugging the other, less worn end of the cable, while leaving the delicate end in place on the monitor) helped initially, but the end with loose connections still sometimes leaves me with a weird display on the monitor. This cable should be perfectly adequate for someone who will plug it in and leave it that way (e.g. for a home entertainment system), but I wish I had spent an extra $5 for a more durable cable.",3,1,2020-7-26,1,5,0
"I ordered this cable because I was having some problems with another one. Well this one wouldn't even display video at 4k60hz. This could be the color depth was too high. I am not really sure why it didn't work. Amazon is vague about what HDMI standard this cable meets. Anyway, I ended up with a Syncwire cable. That was actually able to work at the specifications. This is with an Intel NUC and a Samsung TV.  I have several of these amazon basic HDMI cables. No of them would work, but switching to the Syncwire one solved everything. Syncwire specifies that it is HDMI 2.0. Maybe that is the difference.",1,1,2018-11-27,1,6,0
"I had my new 4k tv's installed recently, and I needed new wires capable of handling the speed and data being transferred for the best picture possible. I've read about the over-priced cable wiring, and I am guilty of purchasing those wires in the past. I have paid up to 600 dollars for an HDMI cable in the past, but it was for a true theater. However, if you aren't running very large distances, 50 or 100 feet or more, then these cables are more than sufficient to give you the highest quality picture you will get out of the tv you purchased. Most of the over-priced cables do nothing for short distance connections, since a quality cable with the required standards will give you the best possible picture, since the quality of the tv and the other equipment is the more important factor. I wouldn't trust some of the HDMI cables that come with the equipment or from the cable company, but the minor price increase you will pay for the Amazon cables is definitely worth the price and more than sufficient.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,4,0
"Review of High-Speed HDMI Cable, 3 Feet Length. -  When I added a new Roku Ultra 4K to our entertainment system I temporarily used my DVD player HDMI cable to test my Roku, I believe it is a 6 foot length. Well, I intermittently ran into a problem you might also encounter with the existing cable that prompted me to purchase the new 3 foot length HDMI. An error message about “HDCP” started appearing when different Roku channels were clicked on. I discovered “HDCP” stands for “High Definition Content Protection”. More than likely this error message was triggered by a loose HDMI connection.Anyway I only needed a 3 foot length HDMI, so I started looking for one on Amazon and came upon this one with highly rated reviews. We own a Samsung 4K Ultra model tv we use with our Roku, so we wanted a HDMI cable that would work in a demanding setup. After two days of use this 3 foot HDMI cable has performed great for us, no more “HDCP” error messages. And the 4K content looks great from our Roku Ultra though to our Samsung 4K tv.",5,1,2018-5-6,1,5,0
"Several weeks after purchase (as in too late to return it) the Wall Street Journal had a big article on counterfeit goods of all kinds and how it has become a big problem for the legitimate manufacturers.  This was one of the websites noted as experiencing a surge of counterfeit products, which I've known about and have reported to them for years.  One of the specific products they described was a cable  like this one that upon first use exploded, trashing the product (don't recall what it was).  So even though it wasn't necessarily this particular cable, I decided it wasn't worth losing my TV and have never used it.  I guess I'll have to get one from Staples.

"Ordered a 25' cable to connect a PC with an NVIDIA GTX 780 to a TCL 65"" 4K TV. Works great, but the plastic shield at the connector is a little on the wide side, so it *almost* didn't fit snugly into my graphics card because the metal slot is just slightly more narrow than the width of the connector. The cable itself is also incredibly thick, even thicker than standard coaxial, which I was not expecting. Not a huge deal because it makes me feel like it's much more durable than competitor's cables and it isn't too stiff so cable management is still a breeze, but the standard sized cable clips I got to run this along the baseboard were much too small so now I have to measure the diameter and get something a bit more specialized to make everything look nice and neat. No complaints on video or sound quality. Functions as expected. Great price. Would buy again.",5,1,2019-1-18,1,3,0
"I purchased this item for a large screen video installation at my church.  The cable was run through a conduit that was just a couple of feet short of the 50 foot length of the cable.  Unfortunately, the gentlemen pulling the cable didn't follow my instructions and had to pull it back out and redo the job to get the proper connector end at the video monitor!  PAY ATTENTION to the markings on the cable end, it could save you from a major headache!This cable (and it's 35 foot mate) is plugged into an HDMI splitter that displays the same image on both monitors which are placed on opposite sides of the front wall of our worship facility.  We have been using the system for several weeks now and we couldn't be more pleased.  The images on the monitors are crisp and true to the video source in color and in clarity.

"5 months old, and already one cable has failed, surely it can't be the cable, they are new, so i checked everything else it could be, nope still no signal coming from cable box to the tv, so just for s**ts and giggles I tried another cable.... well look there, tv is receiving a signal / picture, tried the replaced cable on the dvd player, now no signal from dvd player,(yup, cable is bad) so i have 2 six foot cables and one 10 foot cable ... all Amazon Basics HDMI cables, 10 foot one was ordered to run thru the wall (project that I have not started yet) and now I won't be using the brand, could just be unlucky and I got a pi** poor made cable, but not gonna take the chance with using these on my wall project (running cables hidden) you get what you pay for, so that is my fault, Amazon does and has a lot of good things, maybe they should leave the HDMI cables to other manufacturers, I also replaced my Toslink with the Amazon brand.... fingers crossed that it doesn't die also",2,1,2018-7-27,1,4,0
"I purchased this Amazon Basics HDMI cable to take on vacation so we could watch movies on my MacBook Pro mirrored on the family's television.  I used an HDMI splitter I purchased here on Amazon, so I needed a second, shorter HDMI cable.  This Amazon Basics cable functioned perfectly as an HDMI cable.  It feels durable and thick.  The 3' length was perfect for my needs.Pro tip: there is no such thing as a 4K HDMI cable.  HDMI cables that were manufactured with the first HDMI devices years ago were always capable of through-putting the amount of data that 4K uses.  The devices and televisions are now catching up to the speeds that the cables were always able to do.  Don't pay extra for 4K cables or gold-plated cables.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,2,1
"I was moving and knocked my Wife's 32"" monitor/TV off her desk; one of these cables stopped the TV from hitting a tile floor and almost certainly destroying it. The cable was bent where it connects to the TV but it did not break. It is a Samsung TV and weighs almost nothing so your mileage may vary. This cable works and works well here to replace the broken one and buy a spare; it is much cheaper to buy more than one. Highly recommended, solid 5 stars.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,3,0
"Great cable for the price! I was looking for a new High Speed HDMI cable for my Apple TV 4K for Dolby Vision support and this did it! Glad reports on this were right and I didn't have to spend much more. Great value and super happy it worked for me here. Don't have any hesitation about buying it, it's the real deal!UPDATE 8/27/20: I'm updating my review from a 5/5 to a 4/5. The main reason I noticed on my Apple TV  using the YouTube TV app every so often I'd get flickering. I think it was some HDMI handshake issue cause it'd lose audio when it happened, really only on the YouTube TV app. So I switched it to 50hz and it went away. I then switched the Apple TV HDMI cable I used to have hooked up to it and then set it back to 60hz and it went away. So there's definitely something going on with the Apple TV. I put this cable on my Shield TV 2019 Tube, so far so good there. I put an older version of this cable from my receiver to my TV passing the Apple TV, so good there too. So I think it's def a quirk with the Apple TV and this cable.",4,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"We recently moved, and had a lot of things cleaned out from our old place. Upon moving into our new home and hooking up our TVs, we realized we had only one HDMI cable left for the living room TV.We have a PlayStation, a Roku Premiere, and a ""dumb"" TV, so we had to constantly move the only one HDMI cable between two different consoles, which was inconvenient and bad for the ports. Cables can get expensive, so I looked on Amazon, and found these AmazonBasics ones.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I Exchanged these cables for my ""non-ethernet"" HDMI cables attached to my LG OLED TV and Comcast Box, along with Apple TV, Samsung Blu-ray 4k player, and Xbox X. attached to my Yamaha AV Receiver.  I have only one ethernet cable attached to my AV receiver and these cables were advertised to extend to other devices without needing an ethernet cable on each one.  Well, I got only static on my Blu-ray player and my Apple TV which was working perfectly the night before the exchange suddenly stopped working no matter what I plugged into it (which may be a coincidence, but...who knows?).  And as for ethernet connectivity, well, the devices attached to my AV receiver (which is wired) still only recognized connection via my WiFi network.  In summary, the cables did nothing for network speed or connection, and in at least one case (the Samsung Player) would not even work as a typical HDMI cable.",1,1,2018-7-10,1,2,0
"Listen to other people in the reviews.  The cords do everything all the high end cords can do at a fraction of the cost.  There is no reason to buy the more expensive versions.  They are all rated and tested to certain standards that have to be met.  The other ones are just fancier or have better name recognition.  Will standards change in the future, absolutely.  But that means the other big-brand cords will also be affected.  Do yourself a favor, these work, and work absolutely fine for what you need them to do at todays standards.  Everything seems in order.  The only knock on these is that they could have used better material (such as a braided cord to offer better wire protection), but that is all.  They transmit picture and sound just fine at a great cost.",5,1,2019-3-4,1,2,0
"I have a Roku 3 that flickered a lot. A googled solution suggested setting the Roku's display to 720p, which helped temporarily. For the longest time, I thought the problem was with the Roku. I googled solutions and nothing bothered suggesting something so simple... replacing the HDMI cable. I was tempted to spend a pretty penny on a good HDMI so it works and lasts because every HDMI cable on Amazon has reviews stating that the screen flickered or was black with their new cable - just the problem I'm trying to fix. I'm glad I convinced myself to give this Amazon HDMI cable a try before opting for a pricey HDMI 2.1.This cable has done away with the flickering and now I can watch my Roku in 1080p again - something I wasn't able to do as of 2 or so years ago with my previous cable. The picture and audio are great. I'll be sure to update if this cable starts to fail me.",5,1,2018-10-30,1,1,0
"Since the pandemic started, I've been live-streaming church services. I would hook my laptop up to the flat-screen TV as the monitor. The picture was always out of sync with the sound. It would frequently freeze up. I had to use a wireless Bluetooth speaker for the sound because the sound would not come from the TV. Lots of annoyances. I assumed it was a WiFi issue. WRONG! It was an antiquated technology issue! I was using an old USB-to-VGA cable. My computer is pretty new, and I recently realized both it and the TV had HDMI ports. So, I thought I would try a new HDMI-to-HDMI cable. I was in the middle of watching a YouTube documentary from the computer using the TV as a monitor with jerky, sound/action syncing problems when I got a notice the cable was delivered. I stopped, got the package off the porch, attached the new cable and was blown away!!! It was like watching a high-def TV broadcast show! It was never my WiFi, it was always my antiquated technology! AND, now I could also use my Bose speakers that are connected to the TV! Can't wait to watch live-stream church services now! HDMI-to-HDMI is definitely the way to go, and this cable works great!",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"Before buying this cable, I had to look up what Redmere was... basically its purpose is to boost signal strength over long HDMI cable runs without a secondary signal booster. There is some debate in the A/V world but 50ft is generally considered the limit of unboosted HDMI cable length without signal degradation. So the cable only works 1 way, it's not interchangeable due to the chip on one end. I have a 45' run to make so I figured for the price difference I might as well get the Redmere. Longest run I'd had previously was 25ft.The cable is nice and thick, and feels well built. I used coax staples to run the cable from a Denon home theater receiver to an Acer projector. Plugged the display end into the projector and the source end into the receiver. The projector is 1080p, not 4k, so this cable is up to task and works perfectly. I have noticed no lag or loss of signal so far.",5,1,2018-8-14,1,5,0
"I ordered a 25' rosewill hdmi cable from newegg, on dec 2, it didnt ship from newegg till dec 6 and scheduled to be delivered on the 14th. I was in a bit of a hurry so i turned around and ordered an amazon basic hdmi with 4k /3d, and internet support same as the rosewill cable. I received the amazon cable on dec 8th, having amazon prime helps. lesson learned order amazon whenever possible. After receiving the rosewill hdmi on the 14th i compared the 2 cables side by side for quality and size. The amazon hdmi cable was 3x the size of the rosewill cable, and quality seemed much higher in cable construction. The amazon cable looks identical to one of my expensive over priced monster hdmi cables. If you are looking for a good quality cable I would highly recommend the amazon basics hdmi cables. The price of the rosewill cable was 10.99 for 25' and amazon was 12.00 for 25' well worth the extra dollar.I have a lot of electronics hooked through my receiver 4k tv which is hooked up on the 25' amazon cable and everything works perfect.  A fyi, 25' is the limit for most receivers, I would do hdmi over cat 5, 6, or 7  if any further away.",5,1,2018-12-15,1,3,0
"I ordered the 25-foot cable in order to run it behind our wall and through a two-by-four so I could hook our TV up to the DirecTV box while also hiding the chords. The 25-foot chord is heavy and really thick, almost twice as thick as a standard HDMI cable. The cable also had issues reading the satellite box to the TV, but after unplugging and re-plugging a few times it eventually worked.

"Despite having the TV for several years, I finally decided to get a second HDMI so that I wouldn't have to switch between the different consoles that I have (I don't play that often, so it doesn't come up frequently), so I didn't want anything very expensive.  I was dismayed at the prices of the selection at Brick and Mortars, which were in some cases 5 times the cost of this.

"I've known over the years to just find an HDMI cable and use it. Price doesn't really matter since HDMI has a standard, and all HDMI cables have to adhere to that standard. The only major issue with price is the material quality, which still shouldn't matter, as it's a cable that gets plugged in and sits, mostly without movement unless you're doing a specific thing with the cable.I had been using an Apple TV 4k for some time and after I bought my first 4k TV, I noticed the video quality wasn't the greatest, and I know 4k was supposed to look incredible. The straw that broke the camels back was when I took one of the HDMI cables I owned and plugged my new PC into my 4k TV to play some Bioshock Remastered. Noticed the game only ran at 30 FPS and 4k didn't look so great. I figured this was due to my old cable being HDMI 2.0, and decided to go shopping for new HDMI cables.",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

I have an Invidia GeForce gtx 750 Ti 2gb video card and it does its job.The cable itself is pretty damn thick! (Pic 2) I put the penny there to show you how thick it is. I like it.

"I have bought a number of these, maybe 9 or so. They seem to always fail. I've had to rewire my entertainment system many times to root out which cable is dead, nearly always it's one of these. It has to do with the ""handshake"" that HDMI uses. I get an active signal, but no picture /sound, or an intermittent flash off and on of the signal. I do not advocate buying expensive HDMI cables, just not these. Go to monoprice.com for cheap cables. Luckily, I keep a handful of HDMI on hand for rewiring, I'll never buy these again.

"Three stars due purely to inconsistency in quality. Ordered one pair, and one of the cables works (and the other doesn’t) when hooked up to sources using HDR10. Both cables work fine if hooked up to sources not requiring this much bandwidth. Still super cheap if you don’t mind the potential waste of some being to full spec and some not. The cable that works looks and sounds great. No discernible video or audio issues, though it may take longer to complete initial HDCP handshake than my previous cables (I think... could be mis-remembering and I’m not going to check) even though it will complete the handshake.I will be trying a different brand for my next purchase as I am looking for cables that work with HDR10 sources and I do mind the waste.",3,1,2018-12-20,1,4,0

"This is a fine cable along the lines of all the other mega thick cables out there.  The trouble is, thicker jackets do not equate to higher quality.  Thinner jackets work just as well and are much less aggravating to work with.  The thick jacket and heavy duty plug prevent this cable from fitting into the pocket in the back of my Vizio M Series TV or next to any other HDMI cable in an adjacent socket on my Sony ES receiver.Here is the naked truth about HDMI cables: they either work or they don't, and there is no such thing as a premium passive cable.

"I really dont ever give one star feedback on an item and Amazon basics products have been really great for me in all other circumstances. This HDMI cable might work for some electronics that dont require superior quality cable for HD or 4K monitors and TVs. I bought this one because it was shown as ""frequently purchase with"" add on for an HD monitor I bought to use with my HP laptop as a second screen. It worked for two days and stopped after that. I wish I could have known it was the brand new cable right away...but I looked at reviews on the monitor and saw people blaming the problem on the cheap monitor from Acer....or people thought it wasnt compatible with windows 10. All you get is a message that your computer won't detect the monitor. I tried windows updates...rolling back display drivers, updating drivers, flushing bios,  HP tech help, Acer Tech help....in the end after trying everything else I was about to throw the monitor away and get an HP monitor...expecting that since all my other devices were HP...it would work. Then as I was about to order it I was also going to get the HP HDMI cable. I decided to try just the new cable first.

Recently, I changed my gaming PC setup again, so I needed my 25ft cable back in business. The one I got about a year ago started having a problem with intermittent signal. I'm pretty sure it wasn't either my PC nor my TV since they still work all right with the shorter HDMI cable.That said, I decided to buy another one and just got it today. It turned out the new one got this problem from day-1.  It's even worse than the old one as the intermittent signal occurs more frequently with the new cable.

The picture quality was good and so was the sound.  Overall the cable appeared to be good quality upon visual inspection and I like the gold plated HDMI connectors on either end.The only reason I subtracted one star was because upon initially connecting the laptop to the TV there is a slight pop on the TV speakers and the picture shutters a bit.  Once it connects; however, everything is fine.  Not sure if it is the TV, the laptop or the cable, but the TV is a Samsung and the laptop a Dell, so I'm assuming it the cable.

NOT COMPATIBLE WITH UHD 4K HDR!Do not buy this cable if you’re looking to pass full 60hz 4k video to your tv. The connection will be choppy and will cut in and out.

"I had bought these to replace my older AmazonBasics high speed cables (10.2Gbps), however after purchasing a XBOX One X, those cables would not allow the XBOX to work in 4K. I had a similar issue with my Roku Ultra which would not work with the 4K 60fps setting. I decided to try these as they are rated at 18Gbps. While the first cable I tried worked flawlessly (no artifacts, flickering or other issues), the other two did not work as well. I tried Twisted Veins HDMI cables as well and had similar issues. I finally picked up Monoprice cables and haven't had any problems. Most people have good luck with these cables in shorter lengths (6ft or less), however at 10ft or longer I recommend looking for something else if you are using these on a 4K display. The two issues I saw with these cables at 4K 60fps were sparkles or repeating signal loss.",4,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"I was excited by the reviews on this cable and seen it looked like a good quality cable. I was soon disappointed. First, I didn't pay attention and accidentally bought the 25 ft in stead of the 6 ft, so more cable then i needed, which was my fault. I had a big problem with it. When i hooked it to my Shield TV streaming device i could not get it to work. Just a black screen. A few times i got the home screen for about a minute and then it blacked out again. I even tried different ports on my OLED TV just in case but still got the same black screen. I switched out the monster cable from my JBL soundbar to the Shield TV  and it worked perfectly. I switched the Amazon cable to my sound bar and it worked just fine. I can't figure out why it would work for the soundbar and not the Shield TV. Does anyone have any ideas?

I unplugged the monitor and used the old cable that the monitor came with and it worked fine so it wasn't my monitor... I was unplugging and plugging and changing settings for a good half an hour before i decided it was the cable.

I like the performance - don't like the unwieldy Jacket.The cable itself is good with good secure connectors but the jacket makes getting this to bend around obstacles and lay flat difficult.

So, if you are using an AppleTV 4k or PS4 Pro or pretty much anything that will deliver HDR and/or Dolby Vision.

Didn't even last 3 months run from my projector to my source switch. This cable was run in the ceiling and walls to an HDMI plate in the wall where there is zero movement.

The cable worked great in the eARC HDMI link from recievier to 4K UHD TV.  Picture was excellent and expected controls and audio was there over the eARC interface.  The contacts have a thin gold vaporized surface to aid connectivity.  The strain relief is welded or glued to the cable and cannot be twisted off the cable.

Okay was not expecting this cable to be this thick. Its higher around than my pinkie. That being said. It is a great cable. I've been using it with my gaming systems (ps4/switch) and the video/sound quality is excellent. My bf and I play on tvs sitting right next to each other and my picture quality is 100x better. The colors are more vibrant and the sound it just crazy better. Before the quality was about the same.,5,1,2018-11-30,1,1,0
"When I first got this, i was so excited! I thought it was worth the money and it worked perfectly. Unfortunately after less than a month, it just stopped working. I tried to see if it was just the device I was using but it wasn’t, I tried it with other devices... and still a no go. I didn’t even have it bent or anything. So I’m a bit confused as to why it stopped working...",2,1,2020-1-23,1,1,0
"I've tried pretty much every combination of source/TV I have, but I continue to get no signal through these cables (I'm on my second set) when using any hardware that outputs a 4K signal.My 4K hardware consists of a Sony UHD Blu-Ray player, a Roku Ultra Box, and X-Box One S. When cables are attached to any of these devices and connected to EITHER a 4K television or a 1080P-only set, no signal is transmitted. When the cables are connected to a regular Blu-Ray player (both a Sony and LG) or a non-4K streaming box (WDTV Live), the signal passes through. It also passes through an old Acer Revo Windows PC. But 4K? Not on your life. My previously purchased cables from Monoprice work just fine with all the hardware mentioned above.",1,1,2019-7-3,1,1,0
"So after trying about four or five other 25 feet HDMI cables, including a couple of high quality Monoprice ones and a few from Amazon, this is the only 25 feet HDMI cable that was able to properly carry a 4K signal from my PC to my TV at 60 hz and 4:4:4 chroma as well as 4:2:2 10-bit HDR. Even the active HDMI cable I got from Monoprice had artifact issues and was not able to carry a stable signal at 25 feet.It's kinda funny how a $13 cable was able to outperform cables that cost like 2-3x or more. Though looking at how thick the cable is, I'm not surprised that it was able to perform as well as it has. I just wish I had bought this cable before wasting money on those other cables.",5,1,2017-3-8,1,1,0

"I've replaced my monitor, which had VGA and DVI ports and a DVI-to-HDMI cord connecting it to my computer. My new monitor has HDMI and VGA ports, and I ordered this cable ONLY because it didn't cost significantly more than a VGA-to-HDMI cable or adapter would have. Besides, how MUCH of a difference would it really make? Well, here's my answer: WOW!!!I've read that HDMI enhances the audio as well as video signal, but this is like going from tuna fish to caviar! My monitor's HD resolution now resembles what I'm used to seeing only in electronics departments and sports bars. But it's what I'm hearing that's really blowing me away: the warm, natural, vinyl analog sound I grew up with has been reborn, and my twenty-dollar computer speakers now sound like I paid five times as much!

"After 10 months one screen started goring off (no signal) intermittently the after a week it went off permanently. One month later the second Display to HDMI cable started displaying the same symptoms. I tried them on different monitors and different computers but still receiving 'no signal'. Now, my computer can see there is a monitor connected (even the brand) but the monitors receives no image. The cables are..well were in a permanent position, never moved for the entire year. The issue seems to be in the circuitry in the cable rather than a loose connection. The cable started 'blacking out' then went dark eventually.So if you want a quick fix or for a one-off job buy them but if you want to plug-in and forget it look elsewhere.",1,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"This HDMI cable is like a garden hose. It’s seriously thick. Way bigger than I expected. But it works great for connecting my PS4 up to a monitor 25’ away. Great picture, no lag or signal disruption, and as thick as the cable is, I don’t have to worry about the cable weakening or breaking over time as I roll and unroll the cable often to use when gaming.UPDATE 01/24/2020 - I ultimately had to replace this cable with another brand. I recently purchased a brand new LG UltraGear 4K HDR gaming monitor, and for some reason this cable was not passing along an HDR signal. Switching to other cables I had worked fine, but switching back to this cable did not. My PS4 Pro would indicate that the connected display did not support HDR while this cable was in use. I ended up purchasing another 25' HDMI cable of a different brand, and that cable works without issue, fully supporting HDR.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,1

In fact it wouldn't even run at the 75hz the stock cable could.  60hz was max.  I had to use a display port cable to reach the 144hz.  However, I will keep this cable for any upcoming needs for high resolution as it seems to be a very nice cable for television use with HDR and 4k.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,1,0

We have a 32"" LED TV with a very nice picture... we don't expect to be blown away by the experience or immersed in VR by our video entertainment, so the very nice picture is plenty fine. These cables seem to reliably carry enough information between our devices to give us that nice picture no matter which device we're using. They're flexible, connect solidly and feel like we could plug and unplug them more times than the devices would probably hold up to. The cables and equipment are not on display, not trophies.

"I purchased this to connect a new, very basic 19"" Insignia TV to a cable box. Unbeknownst to me, some TVs require an HDMI/ethernet cable, so this standard HDMI cable did not work. This was also a surprise to the Xfinity installer, who happened to have the right cable on hand. Lesson learned: A standard HDMI cable does not necessarily work for all TVs. Amazon gave me a refund, but it would be nice if the description of this product noted that it may not work for all TVs.",2,1,2019-9-9,1,1,0

Did all the usual things; troubleshoot the monitor, make sure I had the most recent drivers for my GPU, tried tweeking the overclocking on the GPU, etc. It kept getting worse. Finally I unplugged the HDMI cable and plugged it back in and shazzam problem disappeared, mostly. It still comes back and reseating the cable makes it go away. Even the orientation of the cable as in it exits the GPU or the monitor a little to the right or left makes a difference. So I am replacing it with a higher quality cable. So I basically wasted the $7",2,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"These cables do not consistently work with the Apple TV 4K with Dolby Vision enabled on my brand new 55"" LG OLED B8.  I bought three of them to replace an old Insignia HDMI cable that was not rated for HDMI 2.0.  The new cables needed to be routed through my entertainment system which is time consuming.  It wasn't until after I'd routed the cables that I discovered through a great deal of testing that only 1 of the 3 cables functioned with Dolby Vision enabled on my Apple TV 4K.  The funny part is the old Insignia cable that was not rated for Dolby Vision 4K worked flawlessly with the Apple TV 4K in Dolby Vision mode.  I should have never replaced the Insignia cable!  These cables seem fine for regular 4K and I'm leaving them in since it's too much hassle to replace them in the install and send them back.  It's unlikely that I'll need more than 1 Dolby Vision enabled device in the future, thankfully.  Don't buy if you're using an Apple TV 4K in Dolby Vision mode, some of them do work but it's not worth gambling on these.",2,1,2018-11-3,1,1,0

I only needed a short length to connect them, and this cable is actually longer than I need, but it's doing the job beautifully.

"Once upon a time I fell for the cable hype. I overpaid for MONSTER cable (about 15 years ago) and found that ultimately, you don't have to spend a fortune to get good quality performance from your cables. Yes, maybe if you're a serious video-audiophile, you might perceive some fleeting nuance differences... but 95% of us aren't like that. I use this cable primarily for feeding video from my laptop to my old SONY XBR LCD TV. Picture quality looks pretty much 1080p to my eyes. And the cable is thick where it counts. Cheap HDMI cables will eventually cause wire fraying at the plug joints, forcing you to buy more cables. This cable feels robust enough such that this won't happen. I'll report back in a year.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

Great 4K cables but these shouldn’t be called high speed from amazonbasics. They aren’t when it comes to technology now. The ones I received  wouldn’t go over 9gbs. Whenever 18+ is what is necessary for atmos and 4K together.  I would say that these are the best bang for your buck though when it comes to cheap 4K needs like just plugging into a tv with no high end hdr or color pitch. Also- if you have a need for enhanced sound passed 5.1 surround- I would also stay into the 18gb+ range.A small tip...  stay away from Samsung tv’s if you want Dolby Atmos unless you want to buy a decent splitter and three decent $20 cables.,5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

Video from the other components (CD/DVD/BR player, Cable TV box) works equally well over these cables.Tip:  You might need a longer cable than you realize.

They might have better build quality or use nicer materials but their job is to carry a signal and any cable will do that about the same as another. This Amazon Basics cable is a great value and feels like it will last a long time. I've had it connecting my PS4 to my 4K TV for more than a year and have had zero problems to speak of.

That's fine for a lot of streaming devices that output 4k at only 30fps but if you have a home theater PC or want to be future ready, it won't cut it.This cable was the only one that I found capable of extending a full 4k60fps signal without artifacts.

But, very occasional and worked most of the time. Once I ran through the receiver it became far less reliable and I had to switch cables entirely.

I even tried reversing the cable as I remember some longer HDMI cables are unidirectional - same results.  You would think the Apple TV would fall back to 1080p if it couldn't negotiate a 4K signal (but it didn't, not with this cable anyways).  This was very frustrating.

Worked well for a short time but like most things made today is cheaply made inside and I find that it shorts occasionally causing me to mess with the plug-in part. Maybe I just got one that was made by a lazy worker? It happens... maybe a design flaw though. All in all I don't think that throwing more money at another one would necessarily mean that it is made any better as most companies today want to use the cheapest materials put together by the most inexpensive labor that they can possibly find and it shows.,3,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"I literally will never buy another cable other then amazon. Why would you pay four, five, or even six times as much. These cables do the exact same thing as the brand name and last just as long.

I have paid as much as $30 for one cable in the past from a big box store, and the cable failed a short time later.Thus far, these cables have been very reliable but if they should fail I feel much better about replacing the two I spent a few dollars on versus the one I spent considerably more on.",5,1,2017-11-3,1,1,0
Amazing cables at an affordable price. Tested with 4K HDR and Dolby Vision. Works with Apple TV too. I have this HDMI cable going from my Denon AV receiver to my LG OLED TV and all my devices hooked to my AV receiver using this HDMI cable as well. Everything works great. Don't listen to the reviews that said Dolby Vision doesn't work on the Apple TV. They probably didn't set up their AV receiver and TV settings properly. The TV and the AV receiver has a setting that is listed as HDMI Deep Color or HDMI Enhanced that you will need to enable for HDR and Dolby Vision. Also it is prefered to set up the match settings under the video settings for the Apple TV.,5,1,2018-12-4,1,0,0

"Seriously, Amazon basics is amazing. The price of this cable is rock bottom, and yet it's better than (without exception) every HDMI cable I've owned for less than $70. The fittings are tight, durability has been such a non-issue that this is the first time I've thought about it, and I've had one of these and used it daily for years.I'm using this to connect a Chromebook to monitors. That means this cable travels with me a LOT, and gets unplugged and plugged back in at both ends a LOT, into a bunch of different kinds of displays.

I loved the fact that they are high speed cables for such a reasonable price.  Admittedly I have a more technical audio visual setup than most people.  My audio visual rack is about 70 feet away from the living room all run through HDMI baluns.  So this may be contributing to the sensitivity of my set up...I started getting sparkles and lines through the picture only when using the new Apple 4K TV not the cable box or blue ray player.  My old Apple TV didn't do this.  I tried several settings to get these picture defects to go away but the only thing that has worked is to reduce the output resolution down to 720p.  It looks as though the Amazon basic cables don't have the bandwidth for the new Apple 4K TV.,4,1,2018-9-7,1,1,1

"I've bought several previous versions of this cable in the past. The build quality was great, they were thoughtfully designed and lasted me a really long time.This new version is a different story entirely. In their ongoing war on cost-cutting Amazon decided to use a rougher, poorer quality plastic which means the ports on either end of the cable are wider and thicker than normal.

There is no reason to spend big $$$ for cables.  The cables either meet the specs or they don't.  These meet the specs.  I've used them on multiple devices.

"I purchased a 25' cable and at fist it seemed to work well enough.  Then during a certain movie with a dark scene, I could barely see the picture.  At first I thought it was because the room was too bright.  Later on during the same movie the screen would go blank for 1-2 seconds every 20-30 seconds.  I ejected the disc and wiped it off but the screen was still flashing.  I had never observed this before but began to suspect the cable.  So I moved the DVD player next to the TV with a shorter cable and the problem went away.  I replaced the 25' cable with an Audioquest Pearl cable (I know, expensive) and the dark scene I couldn't see before was perfectly clear and visible even in the bright room.When researching on-line, many articles say cables need to achieve a speed of 18 Gbps.  The Amazon basics cables claim a speed of ""up to"" 18 Gbps even for the 25' cable.  I don't think they're getting there.  The Audioquest cables say ""exceeds"" 18 Gbps.

These are used daily by at least one person and they are long enough that if a kid is sitting in the center of the couch, the cable still reaches them to charge. We also have them in our cars and reach the back seat just fine.",5,1,2018-11-17,1,0,0
I'am with Spectrum and my cable box would shut off and reset on it's own constantly  on my new 4k tv.  Spectrum came to my house 4 times and checked my service lines and changed my cable box out to no avail.  I thought because my old tv was just hd that maybe my old hdmi cable was causing it so i pursed this cable and since then (3 months) it has not reset even one time.  The cable works great and the quality is there. I would purchase this cable again and from the same vendor.,5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"Yes it works. I got a 25' cable for occasionally sitting on the couch with a laptop and putting content on the tv. The price and length were good.

I got two of the 10 foot ones because the six-foot one that I had was no longer working for me it was too far away from the TV. These are great they came quick nice sturdy box.You remember when these HDMI cable for $50 at Best Buy I don’t even know they still maybe. You would buy TV and then they would hit you with that HDMI cord that was 3 feet in some instances not even 6 feet for 50 bucks. Well those days are long gone and of course Amazon was always ahead of the curve when it comes to that.  When I first got a flatscreen TV that did not come with HDMI cable it was a smaller one I bought a $50 cable. That’s when my brother in law told me return it and went to Amazon got it for 10 or $12 back then,5,1,2018-3-9,1,0,0

I then swapped back in the old cable, and it worked perfectly.I have no idea what the cause is... whether these cables are incapable of handling HDR datastreams, or there was some incompatibility with one of the components... but one way or another, this cable did not work at all where another cable worked fine.",2,1,2018-1-10,1,1,0

"Amazon Basic products are usually pretty good.  I don't know that I could tell the difference in performance of a basic vs some kind of ""superior"" HDMI cable but there is one thing about this product you might need to know.. the insulation makes these really thick.. maybe about double size of other HDMI cables.  If you need to tuck this into a tight space or the back of your TV/Monitor has a tight space it might be an issue.This product is roughly twice the size of all my other HDMI cables.

"Connections are of good quality and I have had no issues with picture or sound quality. The only issue I have with this cable is that it is ridiculously thick and heavy. In some regards that is a good thing, but when it comes to routing, it is not easy to tuck, bend or hide. The cable that this one is replacing (due to a pet chewing it) was much thinner and I had it tucked between the carpet and base board. Not this beast. It also puts a lot of stress on HDMI ports due to the weight. I had to route it differently and zip tie it because I was worried about damaging ports. I suspect this length is rated to be installed inside of building walls. That would explain the extra thickness and shielding but I do not see it in the listing anywhere. The cable lengths below 15 feet appear to be ""normal"" cable in the pictures.TL;DR",4,1,2018-9-13,1,0,0

I have a large TV, so it was always easy for me to picture Netflix, Hulu, or what ever game I think I have.

I know this is not the TV because the lines only appeared when hdmi was plugged in and casting onto the TV screen.

Where our new components had been working, they had various hiccups like the HTPC display adapter not syncing with the receiver, through to the tv unless we switched inputs away & back. Also the receiver-to-tv (4k) channel seems to have stopped switching frequencies every so often, I expect because throughput was bottlenecked at the cable there. Anyway, it all works great now!",5,1,2018-8-1,1,1,0
"The 25 ft (7.6M)  HDMI cable from amazon basics does what it should and was surprisingly thicker than expected. At first I considered it a drawback but in reality it simply means its well shielded. Because of the extra shielding, it won't have any issues if it rests on or along power cables (even though you should try to keep them from touching).Lastly, I'm  slightly annoyed that amazon bundles all the reviews together for a range of products. The shorter cables and longer cables are very different things.

Although you shouldn't be plugging and unplugging any HDMI device frequently, there's definitely no fear of the cable failing due to normal handling.  Don't save a few pennies by getting a shorter cable-- you'll never regret getting a 3-meter+ length cable!Side Note:  There's a lot of brands out there, some who will give you a sslligghhttlyy lower price.

"For a long time, I thought my TV had issues with HDMI inputs. My screen would go black for a few seconds every so often while the audio would continue playing. I didn't think it could be the HDMI cable - after all, AmazonBasics is a trusted brand and all modern HDMI cables should be able to handle 4K HDR, and the audio wasn't cutting out. But eventually I replaced the cable with the other one from the 2-pack of 10ft cables I had bought. And just like that my glitches stopped happening.Since one cable works but the other glitches out, I'm going to speculate the manufacturing quality is not consistent. Even though the second cable seems okay, I'm replacing it with a certified premium HDMI cable - both MonoPrice and CableMatters have ones that are not much more expensive than this one.",2,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0

The hardware itself is great. Chrome OS on the other hand is mostly terrible... My biggest complaint is the file system because it cannot handle more than 50 folders or 1000 files in a given directory before it crashes. It reminds me of how clunky drive.google.com is when dealing with a directory with 300+ folders.

It's been sitting almost untouched for the entirety of its use, no bends or kinks in the cable.I have HDMI cables from ages ago that still hold up, I've never seen a cable fail like this without being abused in some way.

"Great quality cables. Bought them along with a 2-1 HDMI switch that didn’t include the cables. It’s about time that you can buy inexpensive HDMI cables that are also great quality. I remember a good gold plated HDMI cable would cost $50 from RadioShack and one less than $15 off eBay was complete trash. Get these, you will not be disappointed. Keep in mind HDMI cables are not meant to be continuously plugged and unplugged. For that you should get a heavy duty one but I guarantee the port on the device will stop working before the cable gives out. HMDI ports were also not meant to have cables be continuously plugged and unplugged. This is why I got a switch.",5,1,2018-1-25,1,0,0
"They say all HDMI cables are the same. They say they either carry a signal, or they don't. I disagree. I bought a PlayStation 4 Pro. It came with a high speed HDMI cable. I thought that the picture looked grainy. Text on the screen had harsh edges. I was like ""wth is going on? My old PS4 didn't look like this."" Games looked funny, like a mixture of blurry and pixelated. Then I tried this Amazon Basics cable. Text on the PS4 menu now looks smooth and easy on the eyes. Games are crisp and clear now. So I tested the cable that came with my PS4 Pro on a television with a bluray player...same thing; a blurry, pixelated image. That is a lot of signal denigration to take place over a six foot cable.So I guess all HDMI cables aren't created equal after all.",5,1,2016-12-2,1,0,0

I've tested multiple TV's, multiple devices, everything I can to make sure it actually is the cable that is malfunctioning.

"If you still have anything hooked up to your HDTV with old AV cables, change them if you can.  On a 60"" Sharp Aquos, there was a slight difference in picture.  The real difference was with the audio.  I had an old Bluray player for a long, long time.  So long that it used to be hooked up to a tube TV.  Back then they didn't include HDMI cables with a new purchase.  Sound was always a bit muted, no matter how I adjusted it.  Especially dialogue.  On many movies, the sound effects would cover up what was being said.  Not a problem now.  I did this a while back with my PS3 and the difference was amazing.  That time I bought the Sony cables.

There is no such thing as a better quality signal, so paying more for a brand that claims something like that is pointless. Yes, it's true that you can pay more for a better constructed cable that is more durable, physically robust and resistent to wear, less likely to kink, etc., but if unless you have money to burn, why would you?

Firstly I had to switch out my hdmi to update my drivers. Secondly I've had it for approx 3 months and now it has died. No signal at all. Again I thought my drivers needed updating (which they did) and proceeded to flip hdmi cables, after it updated the cable still didn't work and I tested it with my cable box still to a ""no signal"" message appearing on my TV screen.

Make sure your PC supports HDMI 2.0 too.However, the first one I got had pixel flickering issues especially if there are a few bright pixels along with mostly dark regions. So I got a replacement from Amazon and new one has no such issues. I did not realize that the first time I use it so it maybe because that one was faulty or cable quality is not that high.

With the 15' I could only maintain sync for a few seconds before it  dropped out and started flashing and showing gray noise.  I also tried another one of my older, shorter cables and it worked.  Perhaps either the PS4 or OLED doesn't like longer cables when pushing full data rate, but I'm only finding stability with cables 10' or shorter.",1,1,2018-6-25,1,0,0
"I had a flickering problem with my blue ray player. So, I tried several things, starting with cleaning of the lens, getting it away from other electronics, changing video settings on the player and the TV. Since none of these fixed the problem, I hooked up several other DVD players to the TV, and they had the same flickering problem. So, finally I checked the blue ray player on a different HDMI cable, which worked well for my computer. Presto magic, that fixed the problem.  So I bought the Amazon Basics HDMI cable for the blue ray player and the blue ray works fine now.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0

Worked great, delivering at a full 60hz refresh rate...up until now.I haven't touched anything, but now it's on the fritz, flashing weird colors and sometimes not even displaying.

"The cable does the job well but it's hard to bend at the connector and seems much thicker than necessary to do the job, compared to shorter cables.  If I had to buy over again, I'd pick a different one, maybe cloth-covered.  Also I'd buy a shorter one since this is longer than I thought I needed.

Amazing cables at an affordable price. Tested with 4K HDR and Dolby Vision. Works with Apple TV too. I have this HDMI cable going from my Denon AV receiver to my LG OLED TV and all my devices hooked to my AV receiver using this HDMI cable as well. Everything works great. Don't listen to the reviews that said Dolby Vision doesn't work on the Apple TV. They probably didn't set up their AV receiver and TV settings properly. The TV and the AV receiver has a setting that is listed as HDMI Deep Color or HDMI Enhanced that you will need to enable for HDR and Dolby Vision. Also it is prefered to set up the match settings under the video settings for the Apple TV.,5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0

We needed 25' feet of HDMI cable to run through the wall and into our nearby X1 Cable TV unit. These cords are much thicker than what normally comes with you TV, Cable Box or from a shelf at Walmart.

This cable is really good but there are some flaws. First the ends of it the rubber is really thick so it won't fit in to some HDMI ports.

Other than that I haven't had and problems with picture quality or anything so pretty good overall.,4,1,2017-11-22,1,1,0
Its a basic cable. Long enough that I can seat on the couch with my laptop without stretching out the cable.After using it for 3 months one side of the connecter is bent a little bit.

So if you've just spent $800 for a new surround receiver or large screen TV, just get as many of these as you need in the length you need.

DO NOT BUY THIS CABLE!!!! I have never had an HDMI cable go bad before but this one did. Less then 2 years old and now I have to take it out of my wall and snake another cable in the wall.

I've never been let down by the Amazon Basics cords/cables/chargers and this one is just as good. I got it to hook my laptop to my television so I could use the television screen as the screen instead of trying to look at the small screen on the laptop.

I cant comment on how good their performance is, I am using them to run a monitor at 4k though, frame rate is 30 hz. One of the things I like most about them is that the HDMI connector itself does not have a huge rubberized shroud around it, making it much easier to connect multiple cables next to each other and keep cable management easy.",5,1,2016-6-24,1,0,0
Two for the price of one is an amazing deal! The material is great and it displays a great picture.

My CIO once told me that one of the biggest wastes of money was to buy high end HDMI cable. Digital signals are a string of 1s and 0s. They are either received or they are not.

These cables get the job done at a fraction of what you’d pay for Monster cables.,5,1,2018-1-16,1,0,0
Everything works great. Don't listen to the reviews that said Dolby Vision doesn't work on the Apple TV. They probably didn't set up their AV receiver and TV settings properly.

I started with a media bridge branded cable, as well as another dressed up import cable.  NEITHER of the two worked in 4:4:4 Chroma, or High Range color, as LG described it.  I was crushed.  I ordered this 2 pack of 10 ft Amazon Basics cables, and one worked perfectly with my PC, in 4K 60hz and 4:4:4 chroma.  The other cables were dispatched for use with my 1080p bluray player.  I just received a 4K bluray player for my birthday, and I hooked it up to my TV with one of the 'fancy' cables to HDMI 3 on my TV.  Colors seemed a bit flat (Magnificent 7).  After watching the movie, I got to reading my manual again.  I realized I had it hooked up through a port which did not support the High Range color.  My PC was on port 2, and I had mistaken port 3 for port 1.  I swapped the fancy cable to port 1, and it would NOT sync video.  Despite claims of being HDMI 2.0.  I pulled the 2nd Amazon Basics cable fromt he box, and hooked it up between my 4K player and Port 1, and it worked instantly.  Now I'm miffed at being lured into 'fancy' cables.

If I need a third, fourth, etc. I will most definitely purchase this same cable again.",5,1,2018-3-2,1,0,0

"Every time we move, we mount our TVs and leave our HDMI cables in the wall and thus need new ones. We always buy these because of how inexpensive they are and how quickly they come in with Amazon Prime. They’ve never failed us! We like that they come in many sizes and have the gold plating. No need to buy anything more expensive, these will do the job great!",5,1,2018-8-3,1,0,0
"Excellent product. I was having issues with the ""handshake"" between my TV, Sound Bar, A/V receiver.  My thought process was that my old HDMI cords just were't up to date; with my newer TV/Soundbars.  I was correct. These new cords fixed the audio issues I was running into",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0

Truly amazing what this cable has done for us. We used to just watch on our computers 11 inch screen. Then we head about an HDMI cable and it has taken our viewing to a while new level.

The cord length allows for great flexibility in the arrangement of my setup, too. I highly recommend these cords to anyone looking for them.

Actually their arrive date was 1 day after I had purchased a new TV and blu ray player and I was anxious to get everything hooked up.  With that thought in mind, I ran to Walmart and purchased 1 hdmi cable for literally twice the amount of the 2 pack from Amazon.

"I used this cable to put the Switch on a table behind the couch, connected to a wall mounted TV on the other side of the room. The length made it perfect for this use case, and being rated to go through walls helped keep the routing clean. My only gripe is the cable itself is THICK. It tucked under carpet easily, but having to make a sharp turn behind the TV did require an adapter.",5,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0

Best of all, there is no programming needed.",5,1,2017-8-10,1,0,0
"I use the cable to connect the television to the soundbar. Because the television gets its data either from an antenna or WiFi, I don't send picture information through the cable.

I got the 25ft version. The cable is sturdy and good quality. I had no issues with it except it is unwieldy thick. It’s unusable if you have a tight corner. It reminds me of high wattage extension cords. Unfortunately it wasn’t in the description.,3,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"This cable has been perfect for my use. The measurements advertised are accurate. I am using it between my gaming computer and 4k tv. It handles it at 60Hz just fine. I was and still am really impressed with the build quality of this cable. I am used to dealing with HDMI cables, but this is by far the sturdiest I have come across. Don't expect to be able to turn this cable 180 degrees without a bit of space. The plug itself is very nice and heavy duty, more so than I am used to seeing. I will note that as a result of the build quality, this cable is larger in diameter than I am used to seeing. It is also a bit stiffer which is why I say that you will need a bit of space to make corners of 180 turns with it. I have it running around the periphery of my room so I don't have any issues in this regards, but if your entertainment center has some tight spots it could be problematic. If your tv has a jack coming straight out the back towards the wall instead of to the side, it could also be a problem depending on how close to the wall your tv is mounted. The signal quality seems good and I have never had issues with it in the 6 months I have owned it.This is definitely a 5-star product at a fantastic price point.",5,1,2016-8-19,1,5,0

"Despite being advertised as supporting 4k @ 60Hz, connecting my new Intel 7th gen NUC computer (HDMI 2.0) to my LG OLED TV (HDMI 2.0) caused blank screen/ audio dropouts every few seconds. This occurred for both the cables in the twin pack across all 4 TV HDMI input ports, suggesting a physical design shortcoming rather than an isolated quality problem.  Replacing this cable with the one that came with my PS4 Pro resolved the problem.In summary, works fine for connecting lower resolution/lower refresh rate devices (computer 4k @ 30Hz or 1080p @ 60Hz), but doesn't cut it for ultra high bandwidth HDMI 2.0 connections. Comments such as Oliver T. ""And as the highest resolution any 4K TV currently on the market can produce is 3840 x 2160 at 30fps"" are inaccurate so watch out - this experience has demonstrated that there is indeed a need to buy more expensive HDMI cables if you want to run at 60fps (60Hz).",1,1,2017-4-2,1,6,0

Excellent addition to my bedroom tv setup. One hdmi cable for my new Roku Ultra and 1 for my Blu-ray player. A lot less cable clutter with these 3ft. Cables compared to the 7 ft. Ones I had. Picture and streaming speed is fantastic. Highly recommended!,5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,1

Nice to be able to get a high quality but inexpensive cable with the convenience of 2 day delivery.  This is the latest HDMI standard and will be needed if you wish to transfer 4K HDR content.

The package arrived on time and the package came in its own envelope like it could have been shipped separately. The ends were covered with small plastic covers which I appreciated so that I knew that the cable was protected.

This chord was very affordable so I was concerned about whether or not it would compromise picture quality or functionality. But NO! This chord does exactly what it's meant to and the picture quality is just as the one I was using before. For my purposes I didn't need a fancy chord that costs more than $7, not because I'm being frugal but simply because I didn't need something of the sort. I'm more than satisfied with this purchase.

"Handles 4K HDR from Xbox One S perfectly. Continually flickers in/out with PS4 Pro only when attempting to use the highest video output setting or the auto setting (since that recognizes my tv as capable of handling 4K HDR). Used the cable that came with PS4 Pro instead and it works perfectly. To be fair, it can just be a single defective amazon basics cable or it can be the total run (from PS4 to receiver and then receiver to TV (note: diff brand cable for the 2nd leg of the run that is 15ft and certified for 18gbps)) being shortened by using the shorter cable that came with the PS4 Pro that allows that combined run to be successful. The 4 star rating is because the cable works as advertised with Ultra Blu-ray movies with HDR being output from the Xbox One S at the same run length. It's also a great 4K cable in general as I use it with plenty other devices that don't require as much bandwidth. My current entertainment center setup doesn't lend itself to easy cable swapping and testing of various scenarios so I'm sorry I can't rule more out but I wanted to provide some level of warning for those of you have a similar setup: PS4 Pro to 4K HDR capable receiver to 4K HDR capable TV.",4,1,2016-11-12,1,6,0

A friend of mine (who works in home theater installation) noticed on the back of the television that, unlike my previous television, there wasn't a VGA input (my tower is an older model, which has a VGA output). After doing some research on another computer, he found out that there were converters that would switch VGA to HDMI, allowing older computer models to be used with newer televisions. I purchased both this converter, and this cable, to fix the problem.One thing my friend noted while installing this converter was just how easy it was to set up. All you have to do is connect the VGA plug into the back of your older model computer, connect the box to your TV through an HDMI cable, and off you go! Actually, you also have to connect the 3.5mm jack into the audio output on your computer and power the whole thing through an empty USB slot.

"This is a review for the 10 ft cable.  Although they list this as the latest standard, let me save you the hassle.  This will not do 4k @ 60 Hz. I've seen the Amazon cheerleader with the screenshots saying this cable works with 4k and HDR. My cable did not.  I should've taken some screenshots with my Xbox one X error list (but I didn't).  I freaked out when I hooked this up to my Xbox one X and the system reported it would not do full 4k but only upscale to 4k for games. I added a compatibility option which then said it would do 4k and HDR for movies, but would still not do games in Native 4k with HDR. First problem was my Sony TV was not set to Enhanced HDMI mode.  When I corrected that, the screen had red snow all over the background.  I freaked out thinking my Xbox was broken or my TV was not working properly.  After a couple hours of troubleshooting, I traced it down to the new ""latest standard"" HDMI cable I bought from Amazon.  I also noticed that other people have run into the same issue specifically with the 10 ft cable (see the Q&A section). Amazon refunded my money without question and I was able to purchase a functional cable from another seller on Amazon.  It works great and my Xbox now has no issues with all of the 4k display options.  If you need a 10 ft cable, buy this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRA11IU/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_Q0LeAb0J3AYQWIt's a few bucks more, but it works.",1,1,2017-11-19,1,4,0

Not happy with these HDMI cables. The ends of the cables are SQUARED OFF right before the male HDMI connector. Many HDMI devices have their female HDMI ports recessed slightly. This squaring off of the cable ends blocks the cable from deeply seating in the HDMIi port of the device. An example of recessed HDMI ports is the XBOX One. I am constantly having to push the cable ends into the XBOX One HDMI ports to enable the video connection. The tips should be much flatter (tapered) as many other HDMI cables are. I cannot recommend due to this poor design flaw.,2,1,2017-7-19,1,5,0

The only way to know if a cable has actually been tested for 18 Gbps is if the cable is premium certified, which these aren't.  Monoprice sells premium certified cables for about the same price as these and blue jeans cables sells higher quality premium certified cables at reasonable prices.  I'd recommend BJC if you want to make sure you don't have issues between your high end 4K equipment or Monoprice if you want the lowest cost premium certified cables.",3,1,2017-2-28,1,9,0

Works great. Apparently you can't use older hdmi as your hdmi out on your receiver if you're using newer (presumably higher-speed) hdmi cables for the inputs from your components.

Both my gaming systems would not display HDR, whenever I tried to view something with HDR my TV would lose signal(I have the LG Oled E6 65inch). My PS4 pro would not even display anything after powering up with this cable, my Xbox one S would display at 4K but when playing HDR my TV would lose signal.On a side note if you do have a PS4 pro and a LG Oled E6 65inch TV and you have problems getting HDR to work or you do not get a signal when you power on your PS4 pro system try this it worked for me:",1,1,2017-9-8,1,4,0

"I needed a slightly longer HDMI cable for a client who required a PC tower at one far end of a desk to connect to a TV on the farther, opposite side. I bought a few different AmazonBasics cables all at the same time for this client. In the past, I always purchased name brand (I guess they'd be considered name brand and not generic) cables, such as Nippon Labs and Cable Depot. I never had any issues with these manufacturers, but since I was purchasing from Amazon this time, I decided to give AmazonBasics a shot. Amazon is like King Midas, everything they touch works out and turns to gold. So I imagined their cables would be par for course.I wasn't wrong. These cables are well designed, sturdy and they do their job just as well as the more expensive ones. Since HDMI is digital, there's no need to spend extra money on RocketFish or Monster cables.

"I was using Monster Cables (very expensive) HDMI's for several years. I run all my HDMI's from my computer, Play Station, DirecTV box, Blue Ray DVD player through my Pioneer SC55 Receiver then to the 4K TV.  I know the Pioneer SC55 doesn't have 4K pass through but I'm going to upgrade in soon.  I thought the Pioneer was having problems switching from one component to another and back to the TV.  I decided to test the HDMI's when I upgraded my Samsung 4K TV with a Evolution Kit and called Samsung Support.  After about 40 minutes with support we decided nothing was wrong with the TV or the Evolution Kit.  We then decided to switch the main cable coming from the receiver to the TV.  That was the problem but it still was slow and sometimes got hung up.  I ordered these Amazon Basics High-Speed Cables and what a difference it makes.  Everything works better.  When I turn my TV and DirecTV box on it use to turn off the DirecTV box for some reason.  (you might think it was out of phase but it wasn't) It now works perfectly.  I know you don't have to buy expensive cables and they either work or they don't work.  But, if the pins are not connecting correctly it can cause a number of problems. So, I would highly recommend these cables.  They really solved my problems.",5,1,2016-5-31,1,2,0

"Super deal on these HDMI cords does not mean the quality is any less. I travel a lot and used to have to carry a separate monitor to work since I used two screens.  Now with every hotel having flat screens and most of them are equipped with the HDMI port, and my laptop has an HDMI port.  Now I just take my HDMI cord with me and hook up the hotel TV to my laptop and I have two screens without having to lug around another heavy monitor.  Now with that all being said, this is not my first order of cords!  My kids keep taking my cords for their gaming devices and I could never find one when I need it.  I bought four cords to ensure that I can find one when I need it now!  Also, now that we have Apple TV, Roku, and Fire Stick, I need the HDMI cables to run these and now I can leave the one attached to it is home TV, grab the box and take it where ever I go because I have spare HDMI cords!  I kept the plastic covers that go over the end of the plugs to replace them during travel to ensure the ports do not get disturbed during travel.  I like the 3 foot as it seems to be more than long enough for me and where ever I have had to use them without all the access cording which can hang and is so unsightly.",5,1,2016-8-8,1,2,1

The surprise to me was that this cable is so THICK and RIGID. It is around 3/8"" or 1/2"" thick and so stiff that it can be difficult to route or position the cable where you want/need it to be. At this size and weight, the cable really has a mind of it's own, so know that before you buy. Sheesh. Ready for the future, I guess. This thing is ridonkulous. I would return it if it weren't so reasonably priced. Now I need to find a place to store it. Do I rent a storage unit? I kid, but just barely.I have no idea if the ethernet, 3D or other advanced ""2.0"" features work as advertised. I only bought it to connect my laptop to my TV from across the room, and it did that just great. I admit that If I make this laptop>TV connection setup a habit I will probably purchase a standard (thin and light) HDMI cable for ease of use reasons.",5,1,2016-8-24,1,2,0

"I bet it's a good product, but the advertisements picture was a bit rough on the sizing and I thought that this was an HDMI cord, but one end is actually smaller. No big deal tho, I did order an HDMI cable like I intended.",1,1,2018-4-22,1,0,0
