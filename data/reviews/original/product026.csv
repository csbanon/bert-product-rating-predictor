"There are small annoyances & glitches that need to be ironed out with this auto version of the Amazon Echo(mine shut off unexpectedly this morning, had to be rebooted, and reconnected to my phone for example)",3,1,2019-10-1,1,1,1
"This product is good in theory, but it has a long way to go. It constantly gets unsynced with the Alexa app and you have to forget the device and then rediscover it.The volume is also very quiet and you have to crank up your bluetooth to hear alexa, and when your car disconnects from it, the stereo volume is way too loud.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,9,0
I was offered the chance to try an Echo Auto a few moths ago. It was a horrible experience and I really cannot believe they are releasing the device this soon. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:,1,1,2019-9-30,1,8,0
"When this product first launched I was really excited. I thought it would be a great little gadget that would help make my driving experience a bit easier.However, it serves as nothing but a massive frustration and does not simplify the driving experience at all. If anything it makes it exponentially worse.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,7,0
"I live in a radio wasteland. All I get is an oldies rock station. But they seem to feel that there have been only 36 great oldies because they play the same ones over and over. There is also a country station. Not my cup of tea, but they play a very limited number of songs also. Gets boring since I drive for a living and the CDs get too hot around here in the car.So, on to the review. I have an Android phone and a car that has no Bluetooth nor a screen. I do have an Aux plug. So it was simple to set up. Plugged in the Aux and the power to the cigarette lighter with the included cords. At first, I couldn't answer the phone or make calls without touching the phone, and here in AR you are not even allowed to touch a phone while driving. I was so frustrated and thought I was doing something wrong. But then I noticed something. When I ask Alexa for directions, I saw that she used Google Maps. And I also have Android Auto on my phone and it uses Google Maps also. Now, on the Auto app there is a little phone symbol that you can touch to answer the phone.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,6,0
"I am so happy that this is finally a thing.  I worried it wouldn't work in my older car with an old AUX hook up that doesn't work too well so use one of those bluetooth transmitter things and it works amazing.  I added a photo for the size reference (don't mind my dusty car, I live in the desert) and so you could see the vent clip.  Personally I would like another option for maybe a dash mount or something not covering my vent because like I said I live in the desert.  I have not had any issues with it disconnecting or being slow but  I have a good phone and great cellular service which I believe contributes to how well my Echo Auto is working (even in my old car, I have to say that again because even old cars can have nice things).  It hooks up through the Alexa app, just the same as any of your echos in the house, there was maybe 1 extra step but it was pretty easy.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,5,1
"Feels like a joke.  It doesnt do much of what an Echo does, and it doesnt really connect to the radio.  The phone is doing all the work and this is a just a over priced microphone with connections issues.Not sure that the Alexia app by itself doesnt do all this..",1,1,2019-10-1,1,5,0
"Edit:  2/4/20.  Still doesn't work right.  I try to say ""Play Eugene's playlist"" and it comes up with some opera concert thing I didn't ask for.  Unless I talk to it as you would a 5 year old child very slowly, even then, it works half the time.  And when I get it playing my playlist, I have to always tell it to shuffle the songs (several times until it gets it right) and skip the first song because it always plays the same song first.  I'm going to figure out how to connect my phone to the to play my songs randomly instead.  Will NOT but again.This is the 1st gen I got before it was made public.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,4,0
"I drive a 2014 Honda Accord. The car comes from the manufacturer with Hands free link. My Spotify connects automatically when I turn on the car (phone in pocket). I can make calls no problem. So why did I buy this? Simple. I wanted Alexa. I thought it be neat to be able to turn off my Ring Alarm with my voice as I pulled up. Also it be cool to ask Alexa the weather and other questions. Unfortunately I am so disappointed. This device is not ready for launch. Set up was easy but it’s a pain to use it every day. Sometimes it works and other days it doesn’t. I say “Alexa” and the blue light comes on but nothing happens. I’m talking to myself. It hears me say Alexa but doesn’t do something as simple as tell me the time. Unless u pull over, there’s nothing u can do about it. You’re stuck with this stupid brick until u get home and have time to mess with it. I gave up. I threw it out of my car (literally) after the 10th time it quit. Alexa hears me but she ignores me. I stuck with using my OEM Bluetooth. So much better.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,4,0
"We have several echo devices in our home and I love the hands free ease of it, so trying the echo auto was something I was definitely interested in.  It essentially works the same as every other Alexa device- hands free music, asking questions, adding notes, making calls.  This all works great... when the device actually works.  Which is less than half the time. It is CONSTANTLY disconnecting.  Start the car up, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. If it's working and you get a phone call, the call will go through, but echo will no longer connect after the call is finished.  Get out of the car to get gas? Again we're disconnected.  Drive more than 10 minutes? Disconnected.  Every once in a while it will reconnect on it's own, usually not. Sometimes I can get it to reset by pulling out the power cord and plugging back in. Usually not.  The one new hands free Alexa feature I was looking forward to was navigation. It could never figure out where I wanted to go no matter who extremely precise I was when asking for directions.  Overall, I'd consider keeping it if they can fix the connection issues but if not... back it goes!  Also, although I was able to attach it to my vents, it blocks the entire vent and so the device sits in my cup holder....",2,1,2019-9-30,1,3,0
"Like others I also got mine through the invite. I really wanted to like this but sadly it's awful. It connects through your phone and Bluetooth, if you have an android then all you've done is added a dumber version Google assistant, it can't do everything my echo dot can and it regularly sets itself off when I listen to my new do to their promotional content mentioning Alexa, at least in my dot I can change the name to echo. When trying to navigate to a specific store in the neighboring city it refused to acknowledge me telling it to navigate to the one in that city. When I instead told it to navigate to the shipping mall where it's located it just gave me the old familiar ""sorry I don't know that one"", it doesn't really work with spotify either, it canstay it and play but then it writing stop. Instead the music will play every time Alexa makes a pause in what she's saying.  I would assume even jet using the Alexa app on your phone is better.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,3,0
"The worst amazon product ever made.  I hate that Amazon fooled me into trying this! I wanted to love it! I wanted to love it so hard!  What's with the cords Amazon? Why do you need my cords. I have a bluetooth thing that I use.. why cant you be more like that special plug?First-  I sat in my car for nearly 2 hours trying to get this to connect. I dont have bluetooth, so the obvious appeal is that I can now have a wonderful hands-free option, and Alexa to boot! However- 2 hours, and nothing. Blue lights, zero response. Unplugged, replugged, restarted, nothing. I waited for my husband to come home before going postal.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,3,1
"I've had two of these, because my first one failed at making phone calls. But little did I know it will eventually fail at everything. Even with the replacement the phone calls portion isn't great. It is very explicit with names, and it has a huge delay when it starts ringing. It will also end the call if the unit loses power, which is often. I've tried different plugs in my car power port, but I think it's either down to the auto unit itself or the cable plugging into it, but it resets power super easily. Sometimes on the small speed bumps in my neighborhood. When it does lose power, if I had been playing spotify it will not easily go back to playing. I have to physically turn off bluetooth on my phone and turn it back on to get it to reconnect.The podcast integration does not work. The same app integration works fine on my alexa and echo, but in the auto it will not ever start playing the podcast.",1,1,2019-10-3,1,2,0
"I bought it thinking it would be nice to ask for songs on the go vs having to scramble while stopped or have a passenger do so for me. However after setup, I get no responses from the device. When I say ""Alexa"" it lights up just like an echo would, but my request is ignored. That's only if it remains lit up long enough for me to say even two words. Completely useless device as it stands. Wait for improvements or purchase an alternative that will actually function",1,1,2019-9-30,1,3,0
"1. Setup - convoluted, but it worked fine for me.2. Operation - initially it seemed to function fine when asking Alexa basic Alexa-type things - game scores, news, weather, etc. But it seemed to fight my 2015 Fusion telematics and wouldn't wake up quickly upon starting the car. And then I tried some of the ride-along commands and it just wouldn't.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,2,0
"Absolute nightmare to install. Amazon ""help"" assumes you did something wrong and just repeats incomplete, unhelpful instructions.  I had to figure out how to correct myself. (If you Bluetooth connection is inconsistent, you have to tell your device's Setup to ""forget"" the Echo Auto so you can start over.  Just reinstalling the app and most other measures suggested by Amazon don't work.  Plus other installation instructions don't work as described by Amazon.  Echo Auto seems to hate my iPhone Xs Max.  When I do connect using Bluetooth, music on my phone starts playing and over-rides Alexa.  No idea how to prevent this other than to delete all the music from my phone.  If I am lucky enough to get Alexa working, there are long delays.  My iPhone's Bluetooth connection with the Echo Auto seems very fragile, compared to the same phone's connection to the vehicle for Siri, playing music, etc., which is very reliable.  Once Alexa loses contact, it's not easy to connect her again.You can't use the Echo Show while doing other things, say listening to Sirius XM radio.  You have to disconnect from Sirius XM and connect to Bluetooth.  I can actually do this by pressing the Mode button on my steering wheel, but half the time when I switch from A/V to Bluetooth, the Echo Show doesn't connect and I get music from  my iPhone, instead.",1,1,2019-10-5,1,2,0
"I’m so happy to be one of the few to try Echo Auto before it becomes widely available in the market. I requested an invitation to purchase this last October 16th 2018 and was only granted to buy it last August 29th 2019. Yes, I waited almost 11 months and it was worth it. I already have Echo and Echo Dot, which I used mostly to play music, so I was very excited to have one in the car.I have built in navigation (maps) in my car, but I still use Google Maps on my phone. I find it inconvenient, distracting, and totally not safe to search for music while driving because that means I have to close the maps app and open the Amazon Music. With Echo Auto, I don’t have to touch my screen. I can just command Alexa to search for songs that I like, play my playlist, or even tell me some news.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,2,0
"My original 2-star review is below, but shortly after I posted it, I got a call from Kristina L. in Amazon's tech support team.  She was great -- wanted to hear about my issues with the device.  Turns out that there was an update that had rolled out to the Echo Auto's just a couple of days earlier -- I also did another hard reset of the device -- in any event, I'm happy to report that it is now working well, and I haven't had any Echo Auto to Alexa connection issues since then.  Still not sure I'm sold on the usefulness of this device, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but at least it actually works the way it was intended.Original review:",4,1,2019-9-30,1,2,0
"For people who do not have one, the Alexa Auto is not a full Echo device like the Dot. You could say it's just a smart microphone.After reading up on it and comparing against different Echo devices, I  realized THIS is the device I need in my car.  Not an Echo Dot.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,2,0
"At the time I put in for an invite for this device, I was frustrated with Siri hands-free. It couldn’t summon pandora or amazon music, and simple tasks like checking store hours and getting navigation were hit or miss. Fast forward to a couple weeks back when I finally got my echo auto, and boy does this product make Siri look great.The first issue you’ll notice is that Echo Auto isn’t always ready to go when the car starts, often for the first few minutes she’ll report she’s lost connection with the app and can’t respond right now. Admittedly this is probably because the iPhone paged out the Alexa app, but it would be nice if the echo auto announced when she is ready rather than leaving me to make the same query over and over again until it works.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"This thing doesn't work worth a whit.  IF you can get it connected to your vehicle's system, enjoy while it lasts -- that may be the last time that it will work.  Turn off the engine and you have to go thru the setup process -- over, and over, and over again.  I don't have the wherewithal, patience, or inclination to screw around with this thing for an hour every time I start the car.  Setup seems straight forward, but (for me) has to be repeated many times over before it takes hold and starts to work.  this will be going back to Amazon Mo-Rikki-Tic...",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"I was able to get my Auto as part of an invite. I was super excited to try it out. The first time I connected to my car via Bluetooth, it worked pretty well. But after that, not so much. Alexa kept telling me that she couldn't connect to my phone...over and over and over again. Finally one day I spent about an hour trying to figure this little bugger out. I got it to connect again. *whew* But now Alexa won't answer me. I'm pretty sure she hates me and is going to ignore me for the rest of my life. I chose to mount the Auto with the vent clip, seemed fine to me. But during a road trip on the highway going 65, the Auto fell off and landed under my feet. Probably not the safest thing to happen. I chucked the vent clip into my glove box. Not the Auto sits in a little cubby right near the radio. She still ignores me there too. I wouldn't buy this again, not even for the discounted price.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,8,0
"I am changing my review from 4* to 1* because Amazon just removed the ability to use hands free from my Tap. This is important because that means that they remove support from niche items that they no longer produce. As this item is likely to eventually fall into that category, it will eventually be useless. You are driving when you use this product. Voice activation (hands free) is crucial. So, when amazon removes that option, this will be a useless little box.Original review:",1,1,2019-9-30,1,3,0
"Second time writing review as first seems gone now since I originally reviewed the Auto and the mount as a package that is no longer offered.First off, I was interested in this for things such as turning off my lights or arming the house as I was leaving.  Those little things I sometimes forget in a rush out the door.  It worked, for the most part.  Setup was a pain, took some time but after about an hour.. I got her working.  However, I asked for directions and the dang device told me I needed to open my app.  How does that work for a hands-free environment driving!  Asked her to play some music to amuse the toddlers in the back seat.  Well, that works as I get to hear wheels on the bus go round and round.. Round and round..  If you are hearing that in your head now, please know I have a five year old that hops in the car and when I start to drive, yells ""Alexa, play wheels on the bus""  Anything more then this, she's moody.  I did find it useful to ""announce""  Like coming home from the grocery store and need someone to meet me outside and help unload.  Announce ""Get outside and meet me to take in groceries!""  Gets the big kids attention.",3,1,2019-12-10,1,3,1
"After a few weeks of ownership I've dropped the rating. To be clear, I think that this thing is built well and priced right. When everything works, Alexa response quickly and clearly. I like the idea of bringing some artificial intelligence to my commute.That said, Echo Auto's dependence on the Alexa app severely hamstrings it. On Android (I have a Pixel 2 XL) the app is okay at best because suffers from a few connection and integration issues. Examples:",2,1,2019-9-30,1,3,0
"Update 10/8/2019: For all of those frustrated with Echo Auto, I get it! I updated my phone to the newest IPhone and I lost the Echo Auto connection in my car and couldn't get it back for days! It was quite frustrating. I did fix it, here's how: Turn Bluetooth off on your phone. Turn your phone completely off. Unplug the power cord from Echo Auto. Turn your phone back on. Turn on Bluetooth. Plug back in the Echo Auto. Press the Dot on the Echo Auto for 8 seconds until you see the orange light on the Echo Auto light up and Immediately take your finger off the dot, you may have to do it a couple of times until you see the orange lite because it goes away if you keep pressing the dot. Echo Auto should then begin the pairing process with your phone. Again the voice is low when rebooting so say Alexa volume 10 and turn your car stereo up. The dot is the home button on the Echo Auto or the top button on the right hand side. Remember to quickly take your finger off the button when you see the orange light. I hope this helps some of you out there! It fixed mine and now I'm rollin down the road with Alexa blaring in my speakers LOL!. I was invited to try the Echo Auto, thank you Amazon! Unboxing the echo was simple and straight forward. I received the Echo Auto a usb cord and a 3.5mm audio cable and the vent mount. I am not using the vent mount in my vehicle because I wanted the device hidden from plain view. I have the Echo located in the shift console. After fiddling around for a bit maybe 5 minutes or so I had it connected. When I heard that familiar voice I was overjoyed! What I wasn't expecting is that I had told Alexa to play music everywhere (habit as I have multiple Echos at home) and when I got home ALL my Echos were playing music! I laughed a good one and discovered immediately that hey! I can operate my home from my car! I think the possibilities are endless! I used to not carry my phone in the car always and now I do because Echo Auto works off your cell phone. I don't mind this at all. There have been zero lags or issues while using Echo in the car. I did discover that when you turn the car radio to AUX and say Alexa her voice was low so I said Alexa volume 10 and that fixed that issue. I have a premium stereo system in my car and the music is absolutely flawless while playing, no buffering and crystal clear. My friends have discovered Echo in my car and now when everyone is in the car everyone is always yelling Alexa! do this do that, its a lot of fun! For the price I paid I am VERY happy with Echo Auto and would recommend EVERYONE to get one. I can hardly wait for new skills to come out for the Echo Auto. I researched Automatic and unfortunately there is a subscription to that plus a device that costs a pretty penny, so thats not for me. Buy this you will not be disappointed! Please click the helpful button, I appreciate it.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,3,0
"I had been on the waitlist for over a year and finally it an invitation to purchase this at an intro rate.  It was very buggy. Often cutting out - even when my cell signal was strong (it uses the internet connection on your phone). I listened to Audible on my way to work and it would just stop playing for no reason and when I would tell it to restart, it would start a couple minutes behind. You can’t text or call from it - only drop in on your Alexa devices at home. I ended up returning it / I’ll stick to Siri.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"Horrible product!  It was such a pain to get it connected. Once it was connected, after the first request, it would drop connectivity. I bought this because I have a 2006 BMW so I don’t have a lot of hands free music options.  I thought this would be great. NOT. AT. ALL. Such a huge disappointment.And the clip that comes with it to stick it to your vent is just as bad. The design is ridiculous. Someone didn’t do their research on what the average car vent looks like. If you’re not careful, it will break your vents if you push to hard to get it on. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Waste of your time.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,2,0
"I finally have Alexa in my car! After waiting for the invitation, I finally had the chance to get it! Note that it's available for everyone to buy, our reviews can now be done!This device will access your Alexa on your phone. It basically makes your phone an Echo device and so you can use the wake word ""Alexa"" instead of pressing a button on your Alexa app. It does everything a regular echo does but since it's your phone, the weather varies on where you are. With gps, it also knows where you are. So if you ask Alexa where you are, she can tell you what direction you're headed and what city you're currently on.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,2,1
"This is a great idea that just doesn't work with my setup. I would love to have this active for the whole trip but in order to use it, the radio has to be set to aux and my iphone. Then the volume has to be turned way up in order to hear it, On my car once you are set on aux, you can't listen to the satellite radio.  When you want to go back to the radio, you have to turn the volume way down or else you will be blasted!!!!! Even though the unit is active, you can't hear it because the car is set to radio.In  order to be useful, it has to work like the built in gps. When a verbal instruction is issued from the gps, the volume for the radio is turned down. Maybe with another car this would work much better. With mine it is pretty much useless.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"I like so many others had high hopes for this product.  I am an echo fan and have one in every room of my house so I figured, why not have one in my truck.  After waiting on the wait list for so long, I was like a kid at Christmas when it arrived.  Then I became the Grinch soon after the install.  The first time I installed it, it went smooth but then it would not keep a connection.  I figured it could be my location so I went to town where I had a great signal and had a very hard time getting it to connect.  Once I did get it to connect, I asked a simple question about the time...worked perfect.  Then I asked it to play a song and it started to listen but then went back to sleep.  I asked it again slower thinking I may need to ask slower than what I do at the house and again...no response.  I asked it about the weather and it cut the first part off so I never heard the current temp but did hear what the temp was going to be the rest of the week.  I felt stupid giving it a command 2 or 3 times with no results so I just gave up on it.  I tried multiple times a few weeks later because I refuse to give up and it still let me down.  I do believe that this has to be a BETA version because the Amazon Echo is an amazing product and this Echo Auto is just not quite ready for public sales.  This version is a blemish to the Echo family.",1,1,2019-11-29,1,8,0
"I received one of the invitation only Echo Autos in August 2019 and tried it out for two weeks before it stopped working and potentially damaged my car. I was very excited about this product and I already have multiple Fire Sticks, a Fire Cube, an Echo Dot, and an Echo Show 5. I thought it would be neat to have Alexa in my car as well for voice control, music, info, and directions, but it was anything but. I received the unit and the vent holder and set it up in my car. I have a 2012 Toyota Camry and already have and use Entune on my Iphone. The setup was relatively easy, I walked through the addition of the Echo Auto on my Iphone Alexa App and did an all Bluetooth setup so I did not need the audio jack. I also realized it used the Bluetooth for the Mic in the car so I didn’t need to even have the Echo Auto on the vent mount, I was able to keep it in a compartment in my dashboard that had a USB connection. I was really pleased that it was tucked away and a very clean install and I was excited to try it. Initially it seemed great, I was able to ask to give me the weather report, general info, specific songs, and I was impressed it integrated with my Entune system and displayed song titles and Artists during music playback. Alexa seemed relatively responsive and was consistently doing what I asked. There was however a bit of a lag when switching tracks, much more so then when I used Pandora or Apple Music directly on my phone, but for me it seemed worth the trade off to be able to play anything on demand with voice control.As I used it over the next two weeks I started noticing some serious issues that started to sour me on the device. After a day or so I started getting random drop outs of the Bluetooth connection, sometimes when the car started up and sometimes mid drive. I would call out “Alexa” and just get no response or her voice coming out of the Echo Auto unit itself. I disabled the Entune app on my phone, thinking there may be a conflict, but it did not have any effect on the issue. Alexa would stop responding completely or say “There is a problem connecting with the Bluetooth, please check your Alexa app for more information”. Now when driving this would be dangerous so I would pull over and check the app, it would be running but have a message I had to click to “Confirm I was a Passenger”. Once I clicked that the connection in most cases would be restored, but other times it would not, and I would have to open the Bluetooth settings on my phone and click the Echo Auto device listed to reconnect. In other cases I would have to do all of those steps to no avail and actually restart the car to get it to work again. This could be potentially dangerous if a driver had to fiddled with all this while driving, the whole point of this is to be hands free and provide less of a distraction, but if Alexa gets disabled that seems to go out the window.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,1
"I was able to test the Echo Auto when it was by invitation only and have been using it since April 2019. I love using the Echo Auto, as it is a great assistant while driving. Asking Alexa to search GasBuddy for the cheapest gas nearby takes the frustration out of pulling over to look at the GasBuddy app. It works as it should, like a helpful passenger who can pull up the information you need and help you get there. Once Alexa finds the gas station, she can provide you with further details about the station or provide you with directions to the location. If I ask for directions, she seamlessly opens up my Google Maps and I’m on my way. This hands-free feature is very valuable to me, as I frequently drive in a great deal of traffic and I’m not always able to pull over to locate the information I need. She can help you locate restaurants, stores, and more. Of course, you can stream music and have her tell you jokes, but you can also listen to podcasts and create lists as you drive or wait in traffic. If you have other Echo devices at home, you can drop in on them or send an announcement! You can also make phone calls with the Echo Auto. I have a GPS program in my Jeep, but I refuse to pay to update the maps which are still not current with the new roads and construction. Between Echo Auto and your chosen map application, you can save the money, too. Just remember, you will be using the data plan on your phone for the services you use through Echo Auto. As a tech geek, I was excited to try the new product, but I was hesitant to think it would be as useful as I’ve found it. I’m happy to say that I’m very pleased with my purchase and think that it would be especially useful for anyone who has a long commute or is frequently in traffic.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,1
"I've now had it for a day but I'm kind of wondering what's the point?I am charter user of Echo and Fire products, having bought and used many of them on announcement day including the original echo that I still use, several Echo dot's (My favorite to this point is my echo dot III. ), and Fire TV 4k stick and a Fire Cube. I have also owned several Kindles and Fire tablets but stopped when they went to cheap over performance.  So being a techno-junkie I went for the invite, was accepted and immediately ordered the Echo Auto.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"Amazon Echo Auto is a device that fills a small niche.  It's great for using Alexa on the road for weather, games, podcasts, music etc.  Anything that you can do on your home Echo devices you can now do on the road.  Many people ask, why can't you just use your phone for Alexa or iPhone users just use SIRI.  You absolutely can, but the point of Echo Auto is to really be hands free, and the microphone arrays in the device do a pretty good job of picking up audio commands, even in a moving car with road noise and music.  It's much more receptive then just using the app on your phone.  It's perfect for cars that aren't equipped with Apple play or car play.  I picked up this device on a promotion when it just came out.  I paid $24.99 for it and it included the vent mount.  I think it still comes with the vent mount, but the echo auto sells for about $49.99 now.  I don't know if I'd make this purchase again at this higher price.The car I'm using it in does not have apple play, so I really like have access to Alexa.  I set it up so I can get music from both amazon prime as well as Apple Music, for which I have accounts for.  The only caveat to this device is, that your phone should be on an unlimited data plan.  It doesn't look like it takes much data, but it's always on, so if you budget your phones data, I probably would not use this device.",4,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0
"The Echo Auto has a built in speaker. Yet, there is no option to use the speaker as the audio output. So to use this device, you need to connect it to your car via an AUX cable or to your phone via Bluetooth. Which means each time you want to ask/tell Alexa something, you need to make sure your car’s input is set to either the AUX or Bluetooth.So you cannot be listening to the regular AM/FM radio and ask/tell Alexa something. Because the AUX or Bluetooth is not the selected input while you are on AM/FM.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,1,1
"I enjoyed reading many of the reviews here because I have had basically the same experience and I am glad to know it isn't just me.I can't add to much to what many others have said, but will just summarize my experience.  I signed up for the echo auto pre-release and was excited to get it.  I was able to connect it up with ease and did some quick basic testing while the car was in the garage.  When I returned later the echo auto was not working and could not connect. Jumped through some hoops and was able to get it to connect which took about 10 minutes.  I found this to be a recurring problem.  The eventual consistent fix I found was to enable airplane mode for 15 to 20 seconds then disable airplane mode.  After which the echo could connect to my phone. When listening to Amazon music on the way to work or back I found that it would just randomly quick playing audio then get the error that it cannot connect.  Airplane mode on and off would resolve. I tried two different phones with the same results.",1,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0

"If your cellphone cannot be used as hotspot like some corporate supplied phones, this is not for you. I tried this out and shared it with friend. Neither one of us found it useful. His android phone had to be set for this app to not auto shut it off after a period of inactivity.  Otherwise, the connection to Alexa would drop. Both of us preferred a visual map on a mounted cellphone where a quick glance could tell you how soon before you had to make a turn vs Alexa giving you directions. Think “Turn right in 800 feet” vs a glance at a phone map and you realize you should turn right after passing one street.The connection was easy though and Pandora worked fine. I didn’t try the routines such as “Tell me a joke” or “Look up recipe for potato salad” or other junk I don’t care about.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"The first question many people ask is, how does it work?If you have the Amazon Alexa app on your mobile device (in my case, an iPhone), you already have Alexa on your phone.  What the Echo Auto does is create an extension of that app that is both hands-free and shares a reciprocal Bluetooth connection.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,1
"I bought the Echo Auto primarily, to use my phone's navigation as the navigation in my car is poor. Turns out the Echo Auto is worse. The instructions say...use the wake word and wait for the tone. Sometimes there is a tone, sometimes there is not. There is always a light. Sometimes she ""Gets directions"" sometimes not. The other day I had to go to an address. I asked Alexa to Get directions to 11234 ***** street, my city and state. She opened up my Google maps app and gave me directions. Afterward, I returned home only to have to go back to that same address. ""Sorry...I don't know that"" was the response. I tried every way I could think of to get Alexa to respond and she never did. I have been using navigation for 15 years, so I know the ins and outs of how to request directions. My phone uses Google maps via voice commands flawlessly, but Alexa fails to respond/understand 95% of the time. Maybe once per week will she work properly. I contacted Amazon and after a week or so, they responded saying they believe that Alexa's voice/street etc. library is not as good as it should be and that they might be able to update it in the future. Yikes, talk about a product not ready for release yet. I waited a long time for this product after getting my invitation to buy and boy am I disappointed. The bluetooth takes way too long to connect. Alexa is not ready to use until I am a half mile away from home. I prefer to get my navigation going before I start driving. So far the Echo Auto has been an exercise in frustration. Hopefully an update will cure it's ills. I have seven other Echo devices and the Auto is not in the same class.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,1,0
"Easily the worst Alexa enabled device I own and the worst implementation of the technology.  I want to return this thing so badly it hurts.It started out okay, it took no time to get my Note 8 and 2008 Mazda CX-9 and the Echo Auto all working in sync.  Alexa responded properly and things were pretty good for a short time.  Then it came time for my wife to get her phone connected and everything fell apart.  Both devices cannot be connected to the device at the same time, but the worst part is that I can't stay connected to any of the other devices including the built in bluetooth in the car and my own smart watch unless I am connected to the Echo Auto and media is playing, meaning I have to have music playing at all times for all the devices to get along.",1,1,2019-10-5,1,1,0
"I had high hopes for this. Maybe too high. I was hoping that this would magically integrate Alexa into a newer vehicle that has Android auto and the iPhone equivalent, but alas I was disappointed.While as the voice recognition was arguably better than Android auto, there were major software conflicts when trying to use it. I was trying to charge my phone and use it at the same time and I ended up with a brick instead of a smart device. Android auto automatically launches when an inabled phone is plugged into the vehicle and my car just wasn't sure who was in command of the radio.",1,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"I was excited to finally receive this, but was extremely disappointed when learning how to set it up. You have to have the Alexa app running, change the mode in the car stereo to bluetooth, and have it plugged in to a usb port. My current car radio automatically recognizes my phone so I don't need to change it. But when using the Echo Auto and want to listen to Sirius XM, the connection to the Echo is lost. And when it is connected, it's spotty. I would have returned it, but I reserved it for $25. I'll give Amazon a few months to realize the product in it's current state is seriously flawed and practically useless. If they don't figure out a way it can be used without doing 3 steps prior to using it, in the recycle bin it goes.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"UPDATE: (After 3 weeks).I hated it so much I actually tossed it out the car window in absolute frustration.  I was trying to navigate, Alexa didn't understand anything i said and sent the wrong location to google maps. Then Google maps was trying to say stuff on top of alexa all while music was playing. The whole thing was so frustrating. I would pay a lot more for a device that didn't need a phone to operate. That was such a cheesy way to go. It doesn't do anything you can't do on your phone already.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"I'm actually impressed in this little device. I've tried other car Alexa enabled devices but they've always struggled to pick up my voice over noise such as the radio, a window being down, or other people chatting in the car.I placed this in my older vehicle that does not have Bluetooth but only an Aux port. Amazon says to use this in vehicles similarly that do not have Android Auto or Carplay so my newer vehicles didn't really need it anyway.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
This is the worst Amazon product that I own and I have a lot. I'm almost into a week of messing with this thing and I've pretty much given up.  It's rarely connects and when it finally does and I say 'Alexa' she won't respond to my commands.  You can't ask for directions and expect her to pull up the GPS on your car stereo display or anything cool like that.  I got it for half price from the invite.  I really want it to work but it's just a headache.  Even when it's connected I still have to roll my windows up and turn off my A/C or she can't understand me at all.  Kinda pointless.  The microphones on my Atoto car stereo are so much better.  So I'll probably be returning this device.  I've already wasted enough time fooling with it.,2,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
1. Most of the useful Echo Auto function can be performed by smart phone with data plan. Installing Echo auto on your car will be a duplicate device and takes up one USB power outlet.2. Needs your cellular data connection in order to function properly.,2,1,2019-9-30,1,8,0
"So far I like using the Echo Auto much better than hooking my phone up to the USB port in the car to play music off of Amazon music.You don’t have to worry about unlocking your phone while you’re driving, opening up Amazon music, finding the song you want, opening whatever gps you use, etc. Now you can just say “Alexa” and she can do all that.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,7,0
You don’t know how much you need this until you have it.I was so thrilled about a month ago when I finally got an invite to buy the Auto. I signed for an invite the day the invite opened up and it felt like forever! When it arrived I set it up in the car and it was a breeze. I have a 2008 car so I do not have Bluetooth in the car but I do have an aux in jack so I used that.,5,1,2019-9-30,1,7,0
"I'll start by saying I love Amazon products. I have multiple Alexa gadgets and Fire TVs. The Alexa Auto however is a complete fail for me. At first I thought it was due to the rural area I live in.  I occasionally have spotty cell service where Alexa would lose connection. I was excited to get on the highway for a long road trip where I never have issues with cell service.  I was sadly disappointed. Over 300 miles I lost track of the number of times Alexa stopped working or lost connection. I gave it 3 more trips before finally deciding I needed to write a review.  As my phone is within a foot or so of Alexa, the connection should never be lost. As for it stopping , I have no explanation. It would stop in the middle of a song and nothing I did would get it to continue playing, restart, answer questions etc. Once it stopped it would be completely useless. Powering it down and restarting the app only worked occasionally. Typically it took 2 or 3 times before it would show up as online.When Alexa did work and stayed connected, everything functioned as it should have, making for a pleasant but short lived experience.  I hope Amazon can get the bugs worked out of this. I'd love to be able to have it replace my satellite radio.",1,1,2019-12-1,1,8,0
"Complete transparency I didn't see the point in this and probably would never have spent money on it but received it free because I am a Nationwide customer.  If it hadn't been free it would be going back to Amazon.  This thing is complete garbage.  It should never have been released as it's not ready for prime time and I don't like being a beta tester.First I have no issues with my cellular service including listening to amazon music via bluetooth in my car.  I hook this thing up and every time I get in my car I have to wait for about 5-10 minutes before it stops saying ""cannot connect to network"".  After it finally figures out I have a strong cell phone signal it doesn't resume what it was doing when you shut off the car you have to give it a command.  I will say it does an amazing job at hearing and understanding me, same as my alexa home devices, my praise stops there.  So you give it a command, alexa play xxx music.  If it has finally connected it says playing xxx music on xxx station.  That's great, but it does nothing.  I give it the command again and it repeats my command and does nothing.  Sometimes I have to repeat this several times before it finally starts playing music.",1,1,2019-10-20,1,7,0
"Waited over a year to get this after signing up. Lets start with some background to before this device arrived, I have 2019 Nissan with Bluetooth connections, BT Phone connection,  and Sirius.  I could listen to Sirius OR I could listen to Amazon Music via ""phone app"",  on the other connection using ""Bluetooth"", but you cannot do both and you have to switch connections on the display to go back and forth.  So when the devised arrived I really thought it would connect like the phone does via Bluetooth but it does not. I have to go into connections, choose Bluetooth and let it connect. At this point I have nothing but Alexa at my disposal. Granted many of you would love even if it just worked like that if you didn't have Sirius Radio, as I would have before I got the new car.  I wanted to use Alexa to do other things than listen to music.  I envisioned listening to my Radio or Sirius and also being able to add to shopping list or add a ""to do"". Nope, does not work that way at least on new Nissan. You do one or the other, not both. Why in the world would I want to do that?  It took forever to connect, tried several times, then finally it connected. I tried to ask her a couple things but found I had to yell.... Tore it off and stuck it in the glove box where it will stay till I figure out how to either resell it or return but since I waited like two months to even get around to installing it I am sure it is too late to return.  I love my amazon devices, I love my amazon products but this one they missed the entire boat on, sorry Amazon.Since review a technician called from Amazon to assist. This was a good gesture on the part of the company.  I have changed my rating a tad due to this.",3,1,2019-10-5,1,6,0

I drive a Ford, so I can use Alexa through my factory installed system.  The Echo Autos work just as well as my factory system.  My husband drives an FJ without a Bluetooth radio, so he has to use the auxiliary cable set up. My son drives an older Jeep Grand Cherokee, but we had a new Bluetooth stereo installed when we gave it to him. He just uses the Bluetooth connection through his phone. Neither of them have any complaints about it.  I had no problems connecting the one for my son.  My husband had no problem connecting his.It seems that it only works with the phone it originally connects with.  If I drive one of their cars without their phone with me, Echo Auto doesn’t work.

Plug into car with provided cables, Bluetooth phone to Echo Auto, Echo Auto connects to car, blue light on Echo Auto and go.

I'm left thinking the alexa people absolutely did not take the time to put this device through any sort of pre launch real life testing.  Great concept, not so good execution.  Not that it was a lot of money but clearly given the number of negative reviews they launched way before they should have.  Hopefully firmware upgrades will address the multitude of shortcomings of this device without having to purchase a new echo auto.",1,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0

"10/7 update:I've changed my ""headline"" and added 1 more star to my review. After talking with a few different people at Amazon, I decided to keep the Echo Auto. This is really a test product, not really meant to be ready for public use. That makes these reviews/feedback extremely important. They need to know how people are using it, what vehicles/mobile devices are being used, what works and what doesn't so that they can keep making improvements to it. Therefore, I'm going to add some more information. And, if I have something more to add as time marches on, I'll do so.",2,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"I was hoping this would be like my echos through out my home, very disappointed! First order the a/c mount separate as it indicated no where it is included.

Now after trying to set up 2 times both with Bluetooth and using the AUX cord (to short also)  no success. !!!I was hoping more to use Alexa Auto for other features then the music as it will eat up your data plan to steam music. I was hoping to use it for weather, map directions and reminders. No success set up. Very very limited directions.. I was not able to get any output at all. Hopefully amazon will work out the kinks as I am a hugh amazon fan, put thus disappointed, definitely make the cords longer to hide as newer cars plugs are located in glove box was past center cup holders what a pain with them sitting right there in the way. I will try again after calling amazon for help setting up amber review. Please make longer cords or this will be box bound.

"I'll admit it, I'm an Alexa junkie. We've got 5 various Alexa units in our home (2 dots,1 kids dot, and 2 shows). We also have 2 fire sticks and one fire TV. Yeah, the Russians might be listening, but being thus connected to so much personalized entertainment is great, and really, we're boring. Go ahead Boris, knock yourself out.Anyway, sorry for the tangent, I LOVE THE ECHO AUTO! Yes, I had to up my phone's data plan, but it is great! My navigation gets piped through my cars speakers so I never miss a turn. I can find out the answer to any question my kids ask me in the parent drop off line. Heck, Alexa can even blast fart noises at sufficiently embarrassing volumes when the cool kids walk by my car. So satisfying! Another bonus with the kids, they harass Alexa with 5000 repetitive questions instead of me! Totally worth it.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,9,0
"Oh I love this.  Much better than the third-party product I was using before.  No extra application that must be running all the time.  I can play my briefing, and just about any music I have on prime, just at the sound of my voice.  Took no time to set up—just make sure your phone is connected into your car (Bluetooth works fine).Is it perfect?  No.  It does occasionally drop out on an iPhone (but that may be a function of how iPhone Bluetooth automatically wants to play it’s own music application).  And sometimes it is an issue to get the echo to resume at the point you left off when you last turned off your car for a brief stop. There are also some issues on how Alexa interprets what music you are asking for (for example, I can’t get it to play certain albums and it will find a “station” or “playlist” it thinks is a match), but these are things that can be fixed with upgrades by Amazon in the future.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,9,0

She also said I needed WIFI, as if most cars have WIFI--however I drove and parked outside of Starbucks to get their WIFI.  When our call was disconnected, I got an email saying when I have a friend with me to try tech support again. Shut the front door!!!! Called tech support again, went through 3 people and the line dropped again but the last tech person made no attempt to contact me back. SO--- It still does not work. I lost 2 hours of my life and my blood pressure is through the roof.  I normally get great service at Amazon but the Echo auto techs are atrocious, and the product is atrocious.

Thought that was odd and continued on my trip, asking Alexa to play things, call people, etc.  Seemed to work fine.Next time I got into my car the same thing happened, about 10 seconds into my drive everything dropped and reconnected.

"I have a 2001 SUV with only an AM/FM radio and a CD player. Although I grew up with a radio glued to my ear, and live in a huge radio market area, music on both bands is dismal and schizo these days.  Moreover, it gets tiresome taking CDs out to the SUV and having to bring them in at night.  Hence, I most welcomed this Echo Auto.  It has not let me down one bit, either. I plugged it into the cigarette lighter, although I should have plugged it into one of the other two aux power ports; since the cigarette lighter port is slightly smaller and now the included car charger is stuck in that port.  Oh well, it still works fine.  There is a blue light that shines by the port, and from what I have read online, the charger will not drain my battery, even if the blue light is on all the time.Next, I needed a speaker since I have no aux jack or Bluetooth.  (FM transmitters can cause sensor problems.) I can use my Moto G6 as a speaker, but it’s not that loud and the battery will be drained.  The Sony SRS-XB12 Extra Bass Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Black (SRS-XB12/B) is what I decided to use.  It has an Audio In jack, long battery life, is loud enough and small enough to fit in a drink holder.  The Echo Auto has to be connected by a 3.5 mm cord to the external speaker.  (One is included.) From what Alexa once told me, a Bluetooth connection will not work with an external speaker, while using Echo Auto.  I also tried out a much larger Marshall Tufton Portable Bluetooth Speaker, in the back seat with a much longer cord, and that worked well, but was too loud for me.  I feared getting a ticket.

I don't KNOW that the echo caused that - could be entirely coincidence but you have to wonder.Other problems: In my 2014 Ram 1500 truck, to use the Echo Auto, you have to wait awhile after starting up for everything to sync, I guess.  Then I have to switch the console display from radio over to ""media"" to hear the Echo's responses.  Sometimes, I had to hit the PLAY triangle there to make the Echo's response start playing through the truck speakers.  Then, when it did play, I had to turn the volume up as high as it would go - but then if I wanted to switch back to listening to the radio -  the Ram would not allow me to adjust the volume UNTIL the radio was playing and therefore BLARING.

But I use my iPhone to listen to podcasts, play Apple music, make calls... and once you invoke Alexa (which must connect to your phone) it will not return control back to your phone.  So forget about resuming that podcast, or music or anything else, for that matter.  You're dead out of water (unless you manually go to your phone and this is difficult while you are driving.  In point of fact, you should NOT be mucking about with your phone while you're driving.  I have hands free access to all of those things with voice commands from Siri through my car system... until Alexa takes over and will not give back up control).Again -- if all you want is to stay within the Echo ecosystem you're fine.

"Honestly, you are better off buying the echo input and mount and connecting it with a hotspot. It will do the same thing and this setup is actually cheaper than the echo auto itself and works much better! The echo auto is simply a device that controls your phone by voice with Alexa integration. It constantly disconnects from the Alexa app. Alexa volume is dull until your phone connects and then its too loud. It will only play a few songs before it decides to quit. Whenever you restart you car you have to repair the device 8/10 times. The voice recognition is not very good. Directions don't work properly. If you try to play certain songs it does not work most of the time and if it does, it takes a while.

And it paired perfectly but yet it sez I have no message but to go to my Alexa app for earlier one. Wow thats not helpful. It wont make phone calls cant find the numbers. It will tell you the weather wow big deal. and I dont keep tunes on my phone so even though I have Amazon music it wont play music. So far a total bust. Waste of time and money.Ok update,1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I am a big fan of echo devices and they're fully integrated into my life.  I was super excited when Echo Auto was released, as I missed my window to purchase during the pre-release.  I must say that I am VERY disappointed that Amazon has released this beta product for mass purchase - it's a great concept but not at all ready yet.The installation took me 5 different tries across multiple days.  I followed the directions, but the software is just glitchy and after the sound check, the continue button wouldn't click. I'd have to start all over, only to again have the sound check pass, but not be able to click continue.  I tried a few days later and it went through, and it said I was complete, but then again got an error message that setup had failed.  Not a great start.",1,1,2019-10-4,1,9,0
"I read the bad reviews and was a little worried when I received my Alexa Auto.  But this thing is amazing!  It’s just like having an Echo in your car.  Tell Alexa to play a song, and she plays it  Ask Alexa for the news and weather, and you get it.  My kids are constantly asking her questions and playing games with it in the car.Anyone that says it won’t connect or they’re having other issues, just doesn’t know how to set it up and work it.  The instructions are pretty simply. Plug it into your cigarette lighter to power it up.  Pair it with the Bluetooth on your phone.  And always have the Alexa app open on your phone when you want to use Alexa Aldo.  It’s as simple as that.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,9,0
"Updates Nov 4th 2019This unit can absolutely NOT be used in a car. I received my original unit in June 2019. During testing it was apparent these were not designed to be left in the car and heat, even moderate summer temps would cause many issue with it. Today is a ""blistering"" 70 degrees outside, you can see in the last picture that the echo has a red light this is because the unit is overheated it's a unit intended to be in a car an yet it's overheated in 70F degree weather. Long story short Amazon didn't want to do a return they wanted to troubleshoot the unit. This happened back and forth and eventually the unit still had issues and again I asked for a refund and was told I was outside my 30 day return window? Really I got it on June 18th asked for a return on July 15th. Seriously, just walk away. Now it doesn't even work on aux but will only bluetooth audio to my phone.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,1
"As other people mentioned, this product is just a half-cooked product, to be honest, I would not even call it half-cooked, it is just a raw useless product and it is absolute waste of money for the following three reasons:- Microphone array: I bought this item mainly to be able to do handsfree calling and conversation over the phone as one of the major advertising point of the product was having ""8 microphones and far-field technology."" I called three different people and the quality of the call at their end was terrible, they all complained that it feels like I am talking in a wind tunnel and also, they were all hearing themselves in the phone. In other words, Amazon did not even do a primitive job of feedback cancellation for this device. When I hit the audio trouble-shooting in the Alexa app (not that I expected much), I got a blank screen (see the attached photo)!",1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,1
"Initial review: It was easy to connect and worked great - the first car ride. Even though the the device and it’s two cords reminded me of my old add-on dashboard cassette player from 1988, I enjoyed the overall idea of Echo Auto.  I arrived home after using many Alexa features with success. Of course, I eventually turned the car off.The Alexa Auto never worked after that. The second day, I could not connect and attempted the connection procedure numerous times. I kept getting a message that it could not connect and to use the help section in the Alexa App.... which instructed me to follow the onscreen instructions... which eventually suggested going to the help section in the app and so on: an endless loop! I waited a few days and tried again - And both my teenage sons gave it a whirl at different times. We all agree: it’s a silly device and a waste of money. I suggest this only for people who enjoy sitting in their driveway or parking lot in frustration.",3,1,2019-10-30,1,6,0
"I am a big fan of Amazon and the products they generally put out. I have Amazon Basics all over the house and I love the Echo lineup. I have a Gen 1 Echo in the kitchen (purchased it when it came out) and multiple dots. I have had 7 or 8 Kindles over the years. I use Amazon Music and Prime for years. In general, I love Alexa and think it's the best voice assistant out there. This product sounded great. You mean, I can just use Alexa in my car?? In my brain, I have an image of how that would look, but even simple tasks like, ""Alexa, play *****"", ""Alexa, add milk to my grocery list"", ""Alexa, how do I get to 123 Sesame St?""Pros:",1,1,2020-1-2,1,6,0
"I received an invitation from Amazon to purchase the Echo Auto and took them up on the offer. It was easy to set up using the directions. I've been driving with it for a week in a vehicle that has Apple CarPlay.  I wasn't sure if I would like the Echo because the CarPlay is pretty awesome, but I do because of the ease of switching music.  I wanted Echo Auto purely for music and it hasn't disappointed.  Prior to my Echo Auto I listened mainly to the radio in my car.  I have used Pandora before but find its constant need to switch settings on my car's bluetooth options (we have multiple drivers) annoying.  Also, it used to freeze all the time and I gave up on Pandora.  So I'm moving from a radio listener in the car to an Amazon Prime music listener.  I'm all in for music.Some of these comments are for people interested in buying the Echo Auto and some are for Amazon as I believe they are using these reviews to tweak the product.  Bottomline: if you love your home's Amazon Echo for music, then you will love the Echo Auto.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,5,0
"I thought this was going to be a gimmick that I'd return.  And the first time I got an invitation to buy it at $29, I declined.  Not so, 2nd time around .....  I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about ...... I tried using an Echo Dot (2nd Gen) in my car and I brought it back to the house within a week.  Yes, it's possible to use an Echo Dot in your car but the setup needed every time you get in your car makes it less than useless unless you're about to embark on a long road trip.  I also have the Moto Alexa mod to fit on the back of my phone.  The problem with that is that it then takes the place of the Aux battery mod which I want attached all of the time.  It also does not seem as sensitive as the Echo Auto.  I also tried using the Alexa app on my phone in the car but that was awkward because it requires tapping a button each time you want to speak to Alexa.  Echo Auto has none of these problems.  You just have to have the app running on your phone and your phone with you when you enter the car.  Nothing else.  Echo Auto automatically sets itself up within seconds as soon as I enter my car without my having to do anything and it operates exactly like Echo Dots operate at home.  I have it attached high on my windshield and the micro-USB power cord hardwired in the roof using for power source the map light.  It connects (without anything required after initial setup) to bluetooth.  All I need to if I want to play music or listen to the radio via Alexa is make sure the car audio input is set to ""Aux"".",5,1,2019-10-3,1,5,0
"I was excited to get Alexa in my car... but I'm finding that the Echo Auto frequently disconnects from my phone.  I have a OnePlus 6t and unless I start the Alexa app on my phone every time I get in, the Echo auto doesn't seem to work.  I understand that this may be due to the OnePlus 6t bug where Battery Optimization changes don't necessarily stick, so I won't fault the Echo Auto for that.  I do have two (3 after my edit below) complaints and one (2 now) is a quality complaint.1. Alexa needs to accept some more varied versions of commands.  For example, I repeatedly asked it to ""Play 90's Pop Rock"" and got no response or music playing, but if I asked to ""Play 90's music"" I got 90's Alternative and Grunge, which seems like a specific genre.  If I can't ask for 90's Pop Rock, how is it making the leap from ""Play 90's music"" to playing 90's Alternative and Grunge???  The same goes for many other commands where you have to say the command somewhat specifically or it won't do anything.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,6,1
"After waiting for what seemed like forever to have the Echo Auto launch, I finally got it and immediately ran to the car to set it up. I have so many Alexa devices and couldn't wait for the technology to be mobile.First, the set up was less than easy. It took me about 45 minutes to finally get her working and I'm very familiar and comfortable with technology. I'm sure there are people out there who quit trying long before the connection is successful.",1,1,2019-12-2,1,5,0
"Oof. This product, as it shipped in its first iteration, is a hot mess. I have a  Samsung Galaxy S7 and a 2017 Chevy Cruze LT. I use Alexa all the time at home and frequently make Bluetooth phone calls in the car already, but because for whatever reason my S7 does not have Bluetooth capability for media (only calls), I had to listen to Audible and my streaming services in my car via the auxillary jack. This is annoying, to say the least, especially when there's a passenger. I was really hoping the Echo Auto would at least be some improvement over this. I was sadly very wrong.First, as others have noted, connection to ANY phone (I've tried it with a more recent iPhone as well as my older phone) is spotty at best. Alexa can take minutes to connect to your phone's app, and does not notify you in any way that she's connected - if she connects at all. The only hands-free way to find out is to verbally say ""Alexa"" over and over and see if she listens or if she just tells you again she's not connected. By then you're on the road already and can't easily fix whatever her problem is or plug in alternatives.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,5,0
This is probably the dumbest smart device amazon has ever come out with.  It requires bluetooth connection from your phone at all times to work  Alexa app must ALWAYS be running the the background.  And if you happen to leave the car running and walk too far away and lose connection all of a sudden your phone starts to respond to commands and\or play music you had playing in the car with no way to stop it except yelling at alexa to stop.  This device is nothing but a mic for your phone to control the alexa app.  You can use google assistant or siri through bluetooth in your vehicle with much better results.  Save your $50.  If I didn't get this for free from Nationwide promo it would be going back asap.When you guys actually create a standalone alexa device for the car let me know.,1,1,2019-12-7,1,6,0
"I picked this up on the half price offer before it was released and when it finally arrived I hooked it up without issue.And then I discovered it was actually less than useless because it's gonna get me a ticket for using it... let me explain, when I call it into action it hears me ok, it interacts with my phone that is also bluetoothed into the head unit",1,1,2019-12-26,1,5,0
"My issues were pretty much the same as most other 1 star reviews. The only semi-reliable function of the Echo Auto was streaming music, and I don’t need a separate device for music in my car. I’d rather stick a rechargeable Dot on my dashboard that functioned via Bluetooth. Why can’t they make something like that? I feel like that’s perhaps similar to what the Echo Auto is intended to be, but it’s just not.You have to understand: My family and I *love* Alexa. I have a 1st generation Echo with voice remote, two 2nd generation Echo Dots, and a Fire Stick with voice remote. Dots are super awesome and if I had a bigger house I’d put a Dot in every room. I pre-ordered the new Echo Studio coming out November 7th and today I ordered the Fire Stick 4K for another television in my house. We’re loyal Amazon customers and we love Alexa! She’s like a member of the family! We were so excited at the idea of being able to bring her along with us on car rides.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,5,0

"I got this thru the invitation only program and it's the last time I ever get suckered in.  For starters, the alexa app on my phone, which I never used before was required for setup but not surprisingly, the amazon developers made some changes so it no longer works on my phone and trying to update the app just results in getting the app removed, never to be installed again. Okay, so I go back to amazon to read the reviews to find out if there is a fix or workaround and there's no reviews, no support whatsoever.  I should have sold the git on ebay but I decided to wait since I was buying a new phone anyway.  I used to work as a software developer so I always cringe setting things up because most products are very poorly tested and this echo auto is yet another prime example (no pun intended) because it's obvious they left this up to customers to test for them and they're probably waiting for 3rd gen to fix.  Sheesh.  I won't go into the details.  I don't work for amazon and I'm not testing their products for them.  It's been a miserable experience so far and the git goes back on my todo list. I have echo dot and for what I paid, it's okay but not as useful as amazon makes it out to be.  I mean I use it for a few things every day but a lot of the conversational ai isn't much better than the stuff from the late 70s.  Like that blasted flashing yellow light.  I mean it's great that they notify me when my package has arrived because they usually just toss packages in the front of my yard where anyone walking by can just walk over and steal them but I haven't found the right combination of words to get the blasted light off without having to let alexa tell me about the delivery.  I can't think of anything more annoying to look out in my yard, discover that they threw another package in driveway and then get pinged by alexa so she can tell me my package has arrived in about 50 words. Why can't I just tell alexa to turn off the light.  If I turn off notifications altogether, it will fix the problem but then create other issues because deliveries are sure to come up missing. Classic human factors goof by slow brained developers.  The human is supposed to be in control, not the other way around. Anyway, so far this echo auto is not looking any more promising.",1,1,2019-12-13,1,4,0
"I have mixed feelings about Echo Auto. We have many Alexa devices around the home including Show 1, Show 2, and Echo; with connection to many other devices like Sonos, smart plugs, video devices, and more. Generally they just work.My main gripe is 95% of the time I have to restart the Alex app on the phone, even though its set to be continuous running, wait (30+ sec) for the warning to click on “I’m a passenger” and often the app doesn’t respond when I press the OK button, then after another variable delay its all finally working.",1,1,2020-1-7,1,4,0
"The Amazon Echo Auto, simply put, is just a glorified bluetooth microphone. I really wanted to like this product as I have an Alexa device in every room of the house, including controlling the TVs, but I cannot endorse this one. You need your phone in order to use it at all. It connects to your phone via bluetooth and you need the Alexa app running in order to use it. If you restart your phone at all during the day, you will need to open the Alexa app again or the Echo Auto will tell you it cannot work. 7/10 times when asked to do something, it does nothing. 2/10 times the Echo Auto works but it takes a few seconds. 1/10 times it seems to work like the Alexa devices in your home. I have no idea if these issues are the fault of the Echo Auto or my phone, but I can simply say ""OK Google"" and my phone works perfectly. I imagine my phone's cell phone signal has a lot to do with this as I am a bit out in the sticks.On paper this device seems like a good idea, but it is kind of a waste of money to do something that any modern cell phone can be trained to do anyway using their built in assistant apps (OK Google, Siri, or even the Alexa app if you want!). Save your money and use the free things that come with your phone to do the exact same thing, and seems to do it might better without taking up any additional real estate on your dashboard.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,5,0
"I feel like amazon really misrepresented this product.  It's not a bad product, but it's not ""alexa for your car"" as it's advertised.  It's an extension for the alexa app on your phone - and you actually connect it to your phone.It does pick up your voice pretty well for making hands-free calls where it becomes the microphone and sends sound through your phone to the speakers in your car - which is nice since the inherent bluetooth phone function in my car does not work well.  It's important to remember though, that your phone is doing all the heavy lifting.  You need to have the alexa app installed on your phone - and set to always be listening, and it can only be paired with one phone.",2,1,2019-12-7,1,5,0
"Nothing near Alexa home products. I can see this thing being discontinued in the future. Seldom knows your location, app has to be turned on every time you get in the car. Sometimes doesn’t respond to commands and goes silent, just stops working. Your cars input has to be set to Bluetooth, if you switch to a radio input, you can’t use it. So many things wrong with this. The biggest problem I would say is it has a hard time responding to commands unlike home products. I suspect it’s because it’s trying to establish a connection to the internet in areas where there is low signal, I’m pretty sure this is the reason for some of the failures and why it goes silent. You can’t just get in the car and start using it, you have to go through a series of checks before you can even communicate with it. You can use your phone to do much the same quicker and easier than this product .",1,1,2019-10-18,1,5,0
"I bought this on during the invitation only sale for $25, and I feel that I still overpaid for it. I'm surprised that Amazon is actually selling this for $50 now. The voice recognition is sketchy, and that's really the best thing about it. The device does not integrate well with existing apps on my phone and often conflicts with apps I use to stream music and/or podcasts to my car stereo through the bluetooth connection. I find that although I have linked my preferred streaming apps to the Echo Auto, when I request a podcast or music, the device will opt to use a streaming service that I haven't linked, and don't even have an account with. About 25% of the time I ask the device to do something simple, it simply just doesn't do anything at all. I can see the light strip light up, and I can hear the sound that indicates it's listening to me, and sometimes I'll even see the light pulsing as if it's ""talking"" to me, but no audio comes out. Most of the time this happens, it just listens to the command, then turns back off with no response. Then there's the most positive thing about this device, the voice recognition. It frequently misinterprets what I'm saying. For example, if I'm playing a trivia game, and I give the correct answer in a clear voice, it sometimes will think I said something totally different and count the answer wrong. This kinda ruins the game, and the kind of mental engagement I get from playing trivia while driving helps keep my mind active and it's one of the reasons I bought this device in the first place. I have, on multiple occasions, become so frustrated with this thing that I unplugged it and threw it on the floorboard. I keep hoping it will get better with a firmware upgrade or something.I would not recommend this to anyone unless they dropped the price to $10 which is the price point that this garbage functions at.",1,1,2019-11-11,1,4,0
"It could be useful to have the Alexa voice assistant on the road. Unfortunately, the execution of this product is sub par to the point that it's more of a hassle than it is helpful.I'll admit, it's nice to be able to have Alexa call numbers, play Spotify, tell me about my commute, make sure my lights are off, and set my Echo Dots to ""away"" mode. I'm sure there are many other reasonable use cases. But when you step back and think about it, most of these things are integrated into the average modern vehicle with Bluetooth capability. The rest can be done with Google maps, or it simply isn't urgent and can wait until you reach your destination.",1,1,2019-11-9,1,4,0
"While I have owned an Echo and several echo dots for years and love them, this product is a tremendous disappointment.  I have had nothing but problems since I got it.  My initial experience was pretty good because the setup was easy and seemed to go without a hitch.  The mounting system worked well in my Chevy Volt, which is pretty amazing.  I had been unable to find anyway to mount my phone in there, so I was really impressed with how well designed it was.  Then, things started to go wrong.I was driving through my small town, listening to one of my Amazon Music playlists via Alexa (and my phone and car radio, of course), and a phone call came in.  I have hands-free capability with my car while driving, but I did not recognize the number, thought it was probably a spam call, and dismissed the call.  My music paused when the call began to come through, but it would not resume.  I requested that Alexa play my playlist about a half dozen times, but - though the blue light would turn on, it would turn back off after a few seconds and there was no acknowledgment from Alexa, nor did the music play.  Even when I got home, i could not make Alexa respond.  I  turned the device off and back on...nada.

"I was excited to see what Echo could do on the go in the vehicle. I was left mostly disappointed. I was hoping for a product that will let me hop in my car and use Alexa much in the same way I do at home. Connectivity is clunky and inconsistent and trying to troubleshoot it every time you have a chance to stop the car misses the point of having a hands free device.I finally figured out the Alexa app on your phone must be active, leaving you to having to remember to launch the app each time you get in the car. Furthermore, if you want to use your connected Spotify account, that app must be open too. For music it doesn’t offer much more than connecting your phone directly to the stereo.

When I'm leaving the house, I have to wait until I'm at the end of my street to begin any Echo related tasks.

It does this when I have the iPhone connected for Car Play and when it is not connected for Car Play.  It does it when I have media set to Bluetooth or other.  It seems like it just wants to recognize its name, but not do anything.  VERY disappointing!  I wasted an hour on it and it is completely worthless to me.  I'd give it negative stars if I could.

I finally got it going but it kept saying, ""Having trouble connecting"".  Sooooo......I started over and got it going through the auxiliary again.  I turned off the screen on my iPhone 11 and began to drive and asked Alexa to play music.  ""She"" told me that the Alexa app needs to be open.  What the heck?  I can connect my iPhone to Bluetooth and use Alexa in the Amazon Alexa app and get the same result without added devices and wires in my car.  I was and am pretty disappointed in this product.  I only paid $24.99 for this since I was on the invitation list and I can honestly says it's not worth $10, let alone the $49.99 Amazon is currently selling it at.

I was selected as an early adopter on this product. This was a rare miss for an amazon product in my opinion.

This is not for everyone I'll explain after my daily experiences. But for me it's great.I went ahead and accepted the beta and purchased the Echo Auto.  I do want to preface I did have an echo dot setup in my car previously and this made so much easier to setup. Since the dot wasn't really made for that environment.,5,1,2019-10-8,1,4,0
"I bought this product just to see how good of a BT receiver it can be for my car stereo. It had a very good microphone reception, which was a plus because it is very hard to voice activate Siri with other BT adapters. I can't complain about the audio quality but there is no support for lossless audio codecs such as aptX or AAC.As far as Alexa and whole voice commands functions are concerned, it's very complicated and you have to have the Alexa app running the whole time. Again, Alexa is not that smart and dealing with the unresponsive assistant while driving is dangerous and irritating at the same time.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,5,1
"I own a number of Echo/ Alexa enabled devices for my home and love them.  I was excited to get an early invite for the Echo auto.  Unfortunately it has not lived up to the functionality I have come to love from household Alexa devices.  The big shortcomings:- Connectivity.  It is very spotty... sometimes the Echo works from the get-go, but most of the time I have to open the Alexa app on my iPhone to get it working.  I hope this is a software issue Amazon can correct in an update.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,5,0
"Getting this thing to work consistently is a nightmare. When I first got it, I spend what seemed like 2-3 hours trying to get it to work. After multiple connection errors, the app not recognizing it, and the device turning off on its own. I finally got it to work, but only for the rest of the day. The next day, the app and the device appeared to forget about each other. I had to start over. The same thing the following day. Then it stops connecting altogether. This was 3 months ago and no remedy in sight. Worst product that I ever got from Amazon.",1,1,2019-12-1,1,6,0
"Let me start by saying that generally speaking I love Echo products. I have Alexa integrated into my whole house automation setup including my CCTV system and it all works brilliantly. Echo Auto on the other hand is the most dreadful, ill conceived product in the Amazon family. It’s good when it works but it’s plagued with connectivity issues. Constantly says it can’t connect to my phone yet my vehicle Bluetooth connects to my phone no problem.I wanted to love it but honestly, it’s just awful. I’ll keep it because it was a gift but had I paid for it, I’d have returned it.",3,1,2019-12-10,1,4,0
"My BMW 328i will not allow Alexa integration, for making calls, messaging and things of this nature, if your car is missing certain features like NAV, Bluetooth calling, messaging and want to add Alexa Auto, certain year cars have there own infotainment features that will clash with Alexa auto. How? Once connected to Bluetooth I can play music and ask questions to Alexa to check the weather, the fastest route home, however ask for directions and your phone will not open google maps or Apple Maps or any map. Making phone calls can’t play  through my speakers or sending a message will not prompt the message app to open and send, which I might add is needed when driving,  this is important, so my BMW won’t allow Alexa control, back to the drawing board amazon..",1,1,2019-12-3,1,5,0

"I was fortunate enough to receive an Echo Auto in mid July.  Having many echo devices, I was quite familiar with the ecosystem and what to expect as far as functionality goes.  The Echo Auto functions just as the other echo products and I must admit that more often than not, you are heard when using the wake-word in an automobile with music and conversation occurring.  The Echo Auto does tie in to your phone's network, so keep that in mind as you utilize it in your car. I am still trying to pace the amount of monthly data been used just on the Echo Auto, versus the other streaming and normal usage things that we do.  Music plays very clearly through the bluetooth in my car, a 2015 Infiniti Q50, and I have not noticed any connection issues at all. I have access to pause, play, advance and return for music. News and all of the vocal responses and commands play through clearly as well.Setup was pretty straightforward, particularly if you have previous echo devices and your Amazon app. The size is smaller than I thought it would be and that's a plus for me. The design is unobtrusive and I have attached the mounting piece next to my gear shifter, so it's easily in reach, but not in the way.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,4,1
"I drive a Toyota RAV4 basic model with their basic radio and Bluetooth and CD player. I use the car daily for errands and short outings in an area with good cellphone coverage. The Echo Auto is living up to all of my expectations. It works so much, much better than talking to Google. I hope that Amazon continues to improve the spatial discrimination for Echo Auto. I can get my daily briefings and can connect to any of my music streaming services. The music seems to be of better quality that ""radio music"".  Whenever I leave the car and turn off the ignition, the streaming service will stop and then start right when I get back into the car. I almost never use the radio anymore. Yes, I did upgrade my Verizon account to unlimited data.Echo Auto has some interesting interaction features with my Android phone such as: sending texts, calling friends, asking about what restaurants, gas stations, etc. are near and getting Google Maps to display a route. Sometimes the interactions fail but sometimes it works. I really really hope Amazon can make the Echo Auto interaction process when sending texts, calling friends and getting Google Maps to display a route even more easier.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,4,0
"I wanted Alexa Auto to be able to access everything that I do on our home Echos--with just as much ease. So here is one of my primary problems with this item: It does not play nice with my car's built-in phone/entertainment system. It is all-or-nothing Alexa Auto. I have Alexa throughout our home (lights, security, music, etc.), but I DO NOT let her have access to any of our phone contact lists--she accidentally sent a voice memo to my boss one day and that was the only lesson I needed. So, for this reason, Alexa Auto does not have access to the calling feature in my car--which is a huge hassle. I have to dial from my phone instead of via Bluetooth as I usually did (via my car). I trust Toyota with my contact list, while I'm in the car, but not Alexa. However, with Alexa in the car, my car's call feature is disabled. It's a mess.Plus, every time I get in the car I have to connect my phone to Alexa Auto--it keeps disconnecting...this shouldn't be so complicated.",1,1,2019-11-12,1,4,0
"Happy to see the Echo Auto is available to all!  I requested my invitation on 21-Sept-2018 and was granted to purchase on 4-Sept-2019 to which I received on 6-Sept-2019/installed 7th and been using it ever since with great no complaints whatsoever!Let me preface I'm an Echo enthusiast with 2 Shows (fantastic), 1 Tap (good) and an old Dot (ok) that I've enhanced w/ a speaker base (making it ‘good’).  I feel it's important to mention this as I'm reading relatively bad reviews yet no one has indicated if he/she is familiar or much less owns any Echo merchandise.  I use ALL of the above mentioned and seriously can't be happier with all the various uses towards personalized weekday music alarm, showing or communication of calendar events, setting reminders, asking questions or asking for timers which I use a lot.  Okay, I'm a fan, you got it, enough.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,4,1

"This was the most disappointing purchase I’ve made in a very, very long time. I love Amazon, and I love the other standard Alexa Echo devices (I own 3 echo dots and a couple of Fire tablets). It made so much sense for me to have this in my car (2012 Ford Escape). However, this product did not do anything that it was supposed to do. You literally can’t pair it properly even when following instructions over and over.. it resets every time you turn off the car, and doesn’t work well even in the few moments when it is temporarily paired. I know that my car’s Bluetooth works because I can use Ford Sync to make calls while driving all the time. This ‘Carlexa’ is terrible. Can’t even use for something as simple as driving directions (iPhone forces me to open maps app, so what’s the point?!)..",1,1,2019-10-7,1,5,0
"I have had this for a little over two weeks now and so far I have had average experience with its responsiveness and operation. AS for set up, it was pretty easy and straight forward, just make sure you restart your phone and turn on Bluetooth and see that it has paired with your car already before attempting to plug in the Echo Auto and setting it up with your phone. The package comes with a vent install clip and a dual USB power adapter which is nice for some cars. I have a flat dashboard so did not use the clip and just used a double sided tape to stick the Echo to the dashboard and run the power cord along side to the power source. I think this would be a great addition to my smart devices if functioned as expected and currently  I am not very impressed with it as far as the responsiveness as you have to wait several seconds from the time you call it out to wake and the time you ask your question or give it directions (unlike my other Echo devices) but will definitely try it out more and update my review as time goes by.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,3,0
"When I signed up as one of the early receivers of the Echo Auto I was really excited, but now I keep wondering if I should send it back. My biggest complaint is that you have to keep your radio in aux mode to hear anything it says, which is idiotic because it would be nice to listen to the radio in my car. I changed the maps/directions to Waze and thought that the voice activation would be great, but it requires you to click on your phone screen to get it going, which seems totally stipid because I can do that simply by starting Waze on my own. I guess if you are lonley and want someone to tell you jokes it's nice, but I have zero use for this thing as it is today. Very disappointed. Also don't love the long micro usb cable you have to use. Poor design, little use, don't buy it.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,4,0

"I am having connection issues. It feels dangerous because I am distracted trying to give it commands until it works. It is also a pain that I have to disconnect my iPhone from wifi before getting in my car since my car is close enough to pick up wifi. That will cause a connection problem. Most of the time it doesn’t think it is connected to tell me the weather when it is already playing music. It just feels unsafe to use as a driver. The microphones are incredible! An internal battery to charge would be better than a wire. I am a loyal Alexa person but this is not ready.Set up froze halfway through 3 times. Finally deleted app, disconnected wifi, and reinstalled app. Then echo auto installed. 30 minutes.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,4,0
"I received my Echo Auto in September 2019 and it did not perform as advertised.  Asking Alexa a simple question like ""Alexa, what time is it?"" resulted in a partial response from Alexa with the last second(s) of her response cut off, like ""The time is three twenty t...""  instead of ""The time is three twenty two PM"".  Alexa's longer responses to other questions produced choppy audio with her response cutting in and out.  After taking my car, a 2016 Subaru Forester, to the dealership for a firmware update to the latest version and still experiencing the same symptoms, I contacted Amazon's tech support for the device.  This involved numerous phone calls back and forth between myself and Amazon.  Finally Amazon's Echo tech support told me that the Echo Auto was not compatible with the Bluetooth version in my vehicle.  They told me to return it for a full refund, which I did.  Alexa did play music on my car audio system flawlessly, however.  It was just Alexa's voice responses which were problematic, and it took quite a while for Amazon's Echo tech support to finally identify the real cause of Alexa's failure to perform properly.",2,1,2020-2-12,1,3,0
I have several Echo devices and we really like them around the house but the Echo Auto isn't quite there yet. First off let me tell you what this is. This is not a stand alone Echo device. This is a microphone to control the Alexa app on your phone. If you don't have the app running this doesn't do anything other than act as a bluetooth microphone. I think the most frustrating thing is when you are driving and have bad data Echo Auto is totally useless and to make it worse now the Alexa app on my phone keeps signing off on me. I start the app and start my drive only to find out when I make a request to make a phone call or play some music only to get a bonk sound play through my stereo. This is supposed to be a hands free device but I find myself trying to quick sign in while I'm stopped or just not using it because it would be unsafe to get the app running again. It would be awesome to have a fully functioning Echo in my truck but this misses the mark.,2,1,2019-12-13,1,3,0
"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a hude proponent of smart everything and use Echo products daily. I think the future will hold AI in almost every aspect of life and like it or not I think that's where we are headed. So clearly the next logical step was to have AI in our cars. I see this as a great step and wanted to get in as an early adopter. That said, version one products have always and will always have some problems, the echo auto is no different.So let's start with the good.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,3,0
"As most people, I love my Alexa for our smart home integration. Before getting the invitation to purchase this device I was thinking how useful an Alexa would be for my vehicle(s). I knew it would be just a matter of time for radio manufacturers to start adding Alexa, but no need to wait, it is available now! For the intro price, I really had nothing to lose. I purchased the Amazon Alexa Auto in hopes it would allow me to turn on lights or control our smart house devices when I was in my vehicle. We like the fact that with just our voices, (safer) I can turn on my house lights, unlock my doors, etc. If your smart devices are controlled through your home Alexa, they can now be controlled in your vehicle.I placed mine in my center console, & happy to say it works perfectly.  Currently using in a  2015 Toyota 4-Runner stock head unit and an iPhone.  The device is pretty small and lightweight, which makes it easy to install anywhere your voice can be heard. The device was quick to connect to my vehicle, using the Alexa smart phone app. They come with a vent mount, but was able to use 3M double stick take to mount it. The device require a USB, which comes with a double USB cigarette lighter plug. Really, plug in/power up, add in app, and start using - all in less than five (5) mins.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,3,0
"To summarize, this is basically an extra component that uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. In turn your Bluetooth connects to your radio. Product serves really no purpose, as it has to maintain constant connection to the alexa app on phone. Meaning you get in your car. Put your phone on your mount. Start to drive away, and you say “Alexa”, the first response will be “lost connection to the amazon alexa app”. So now you have to unlock your phone and go to the app for it to connect correctly. Which if you have apple car play or android auto this makes this even more of useless gadget. I wouldn’t recommend till they at least solve the issue of having to connect to your phone and app within your phone. If this were a stand alone device this would be great. Instead it’s more trouble, than usefulness. Would not recommend.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,4,0
"I got this a few months ago and held off on writing a review until I'd used it for a while,  first the good things1-It makes it sooooo much easier to listen to my Audible Audio-books in the car, before I had to add them to a thumb-drive then try to work it though the in car system which was glitchy to say the least.  I had 0 problems listening once I got the echo auto - well maybe one problem now I listened to all the books I'd bought and need to buy more.",4,1,2019-11-29,1,3,0
"We have two full sized Echo, three Dots and a Show - we like this technology. But the Echo Auto is just dumb. It doesn’t work well, it commandeers an air vent, and if you’re an Apple CarPlay user it doesn’t do anything new...and what they do the same, CarPlay does much better.I thought it would be great to be able to ask it to play Pandora stations so I could keep my eyes on the road. That’s worked about 3 out of 15 times I’ve tried. I just get the “Sorry, I can’t connect” message, but I have no issues getting my phone to play it. Also, sometimes it tries to play out of my phone's speakers, which is dumb - it sounds awful and wastes my phone’s battery...and it’s supposed to play thru the car.",1,1,2019-11-2,1,3,0
"Read other 1 star reviews, thought maybe it would integrate better for me. Didn't happen - initially worked well for a day or two, then would continually not connect correctly, either had a bluetooth connection problem or could not connect to the Alexa app on my phone. Using a  Galaxy S7 Android and a new 2019 Toyota C-HR. The frustrating part is that it would work for 2-3 days, then start acting up and wouldn't connect. You could restart the app, unpair bluetooth, unplug echo auto, restart phone, or any other troubleshooting and it would start to work. You would think you had it solved then the next time you started your car it may work for 2- 3 times, but then all of a sudden wouldn't connect again. You could have it working perfectly, stop the car and go into the store, come out  and start-up and have problems. I am very Alexa and echo experienced, have set-up over 15-20 devices in my home and family and not experienced this type of frustration. Returning and waiting for either a second generation or a software/firmware update that will alleviate these issues.Ron",1,1,2019-10-27,1,4,0
"I can't tell you how disappointed I am for the first time in Amazon. When I received this from their opening promotion, I was so excited to get it. How cool it would be to take my trip to the beach this summer and have Alexa next to me riding shotgun. That didn't happen! I've had so many problems connecting this and have contacted Amazon several times. When I try to engage Alexa and ask a question it is almost always misunderstood. Please know that I have an Amazon Echo and two Amazon Dots in my home and I have had zero problems with speech recognition or understanding. I love them! If I could claim them on my taxes, I would because they are like family and roommates combined. (Says a lot about my social life, doesn't it?). The Amazon Auto has given me problems from the first time I connected it and I had tried to find the proper information, but found it so difficult for the consumer and THAT was very frustrating. I have a Master's Degree and still couldn't figure this out? Then I get messages on the screen saying that my Toyota Prius v can't handle the power of the Echo Auto.  Say what?? I called Amazon again to tell them about this new message and they said that there is nothing that they can do. I've had this for a few months so I can't return it, but I am surprised at the unwillingness of customer service to help. I've questioned several people that have this device and three out of the four neighbors I know that have it are experiencing the same problems. I'm so disappointed!",2,1,2019-10-13,1,2,0
"So I have mixed feelings about this and have been pretty disappointed, as I was so excited to try this out.. the not so good: it’s supposed to make your vehicle hands free, but often I feel more frustration just trying to get it to work before I take off that I disconnect it.  Alexa constantly has issues connecting to the apps, although my phone will say it is connected.  At times, this happens while driving down the road which is pretty annoying.  Using it to make calls is rough.  It’s also strange that it doesn’t automatically take over calls.. I have to physically check that I want the device to answer or make a call.  So, definitely defeats the whole ‘handsfree’ part.  There is apparently a lot of road noise on the other end, so I am hardly heard.  The cords.. I hate them. First of all, I get that it’s not compatible with all vehicle vents, but even still I wouldn’t want it in my vent with two cords hanging everywhere.  I ended up having to sit mine in a cubby space built into my car by the gear shift.  Aye!  cords everywhere and it’s annoying And hazardous for passengers. I recognize that my cars limited abilities, no blue tooth, makes this even worse yet even still, the device has to be plugged into my car power constantly or it resets and won’t connect seamlessly.  This device cannot go cordless.  I am really wondering.. is this a beta model?!",2,1,2019-12-5,1,2,0
"Hard pass unless you are a glutton for punishment or just have to have Alexa on the go.Perhaps I’m just spoiled with how easy most Amazon products are to set up and how they just work.  The Echo Auto does not fit this mold at all.  I echo (pun intended) the copious sentiment already expressed in that it’s terribly difficult to make it work.  It took me over two hours, and I have a fully functional, self-installed home security/lighting/camera setup at home.  I love to tinker, but this is just maddening.  When it worked, I couldn't figure out what made it work; then the next time I started the car, it didn’t work again.  So many times!  So much swearing!!

"I am a big fan of Echo products and own more than a dozen. I signed up for the ""invitation only"" email that was supposed to get me this device. After almost one year of waiting, it arrived and immediately I had a problem installing as the promised ""dash mount"" was discontinued. As I have round air vents, I had to shove it in with force to get it to stay. Then the cord had to be buried along a channel to the 12V cigarette lighter. Finally, after a few tries at connecting it worked but only sporadically.I bought this as my wife's car doesn't have Car Play and I though having the navigation with voice and screen where she could see it would be great, but this is the first Echo device that disappoints.

"Easy to install but auto connectivity is a pain sometimes. Sometimes Bluetooth shows EchoAuto connected but Alexa says unable to connect and in this case, the device never connects even though Alexa keeps saying ""still trying to connect and unable to make connection"" reiterative number of time. The only option is to disconnect manually and reopen the Alexa app manually. Even sometimes Alexa ask to restart app when it is safe to do so.2nd issue I saw is sometimes it says can't connect to Spotify and asks to restart the app. But whenever it's connected and the network is there, it works like a charm. Can control all smart devices of the home being in car. Although talking about network, this device completely relies on that and you can never expect a good network while traveling in the US. So basically it leaves device useless. I believe in such cases device should allow offline control to play offline saved songs from the mobile at least. Instead Alexa gives up and says the network is not connected.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,3,0
"I was so excited about this product. I use many different Echo devices in my home, and thought adding one to my car would be amazing. Unfortunately, this device is only passably convenient.First of all, I'll often find that I have to disconnect my phone from WiFi for the thing to work in the first place.

"Ok...  Full disclosure: I really, REALLY wanted this to work.  I'm kind of a psuedo-Echo/Alexa fanatic.  I have various types of Echoes all over my house and I have found soooo much help and fun with the them/her (Alexa). So as soon as they announced that there'd be an Echo for my car and I was invited to get one of the first shipped out, I put my name in on the request list.  Eight to nine months later, I got my chance to order one (much to the chagrin of my wife).If you don't know, Echo-auto works through your Alexa app on your cell phone (ie, it uses 4G/5G streaming data). The Echo-auto module is about the size of a dozen or so business cards stacked together (conveniently small) and connects to your phone via a bluetooth connection. It gets its power from a USB ""cigarette lighter"" adapter and comes with a audio patch cable (male on both ends) to connect to your car stereo, so that Alexa and all your streaming content is palyed through your existing speakers (NOTE: the Echo-auto DOES NOT have any speakers or audio out of itself). The Echo-auto to car stereo connection can also be established via bluetooth, if your vehicle is so equipped.",2,1,2019-12-22,1,2,0
"I've had this since beta and have just been waiting for them to open it up publicly so I could post this review. Echo auto is a terrible product. It would be fine if it worked as it's supposed to - in fact, I loved it for the first few minutes after first unboxing it. It goes downhill from there.It simply doesn't work well. Nearly every time I start up the car it fails to connect automatically to my phone. I've followed any and all recommended solutions such as turning off battery optimization and allowing alexa app to run in background, etc. without luck. I've tried with several mainstream, popular current generation phones. The issue remains - it simply doesn't connect until you manually open the alexa app.",1,1,2019-10-27,1,2,0
"First off, I am glad I got this at the special invitation half-price or at $25.00.  Set-up was easy but that was about the only positive thing about this device.  It has to connect with your cell phone via the Alexa app by bluetooth in order to work.  It connects with my Iphone only half the time.  After you open the app, you have to click on the ""I am a passenger"" link for it to connect.  Sometimes (20% of the time at most) I don't have to open the app when I get in my car and it will connect.  You will know it is not connected if you ask a question and you don't see the blue light on the device stay on like on the regular Echos.  However, this link frequently doesn't pop up when you open the app giving you the feeling the app is connected but then when you ask Alexa a question, it will say, ""I am unable to connect at  this time"".  Or, I will find out it is not connected when I ask a question like what the weather forecast for the day is and Alexa will respond by telling me I need to update my address in settings in order to give me the information (even though my address is set-up already). but will check manually by telling her what city.  Then, when I say my city name, she can't find the city.As other reviewers have stated, you have to turn your volume up very high just to hear Alexa which is a pain because when you switch back over (from bluetooth which you have to be on to use Alexa) to your radio/CD/mp3, you will come close to blowing your speakers if you don't turn down your volume first - it doesn't have an auto-adjust volume.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,2,0
"I was an invitee who received my device last month. The new Echo Auto needs more fine-tuning; however, I recall that the Amazon Echo was also buggy when first released. I am sure that the Amazon engineers will improve this device in time, but you need to realize that it may not initially live up to your expectations. The set-up was simple.  You will need the Amazon Alexa app installed on your iOS or Android phone to do the set-up. Voice recognition is okay, but because you are in a car, outside noise may sometimes interfere, especially if you like to drive with your window(s) down. Connectivity is tricky. Make sure that your phone's Bluetooth is already on before you turn on the car's engine. I have an iPhone 7 Plus. If I do not already have the phone's Bluetooth on, Echo Auto will not find my phone. I then have to unplug the Echo Auto, wait about 5 seconds, and then plug it back into my car's auxiliary USB port.  Volume cannot be controlled by Echo Auto. You have to use your car's volume controls.  For reasons unknown, the Echo Auto will,  for example, be streaming music, news, or an audiobook, and pause. I then have to command Echo Auto to start playing the program again. If an incoming call occurs on my phone, the Echo Auto will stop streaming so that I can respond to the call hands-free through my car's audio system. Still, it must be commanded to resume my program after the call.Furthermore, Echo Auto cannot do some of the things that the Amazon Echo can do. However, it can remotely turn on (or off) your lights and activate or deactivate your home security system.  The big plus for the Echo Auto is that I can stream without taking my eyes off the road. Overall, Echo Auto is a new technology, and it does have some bugs that will need to be worked out.",1,1,2019-10-12,1,2,0
"I really wanted to like it. I waited for what seemed like forever to get this with my special invite... shocker I got it the day before it went on sale to everybody. Thanks I Guess!?!?  I had been wanting to make an Echo dot work in my car forever but saw that Amazon was doing that work for me so no need to try myself.  Finally received the Echo Auto and was pleasantly surprised to see that it appears as though someone already had received it before me.  It looked noticeably used, first strike.  I only kept it because I had waited on it so long and it didn't look to be in terrible shape. Now for all the other issues and annoyances.  The cords... oh the cords... why so much cord.  I was excited to bring my 2008 Prius commuter into the current decade with hands free blue tooth but to do so I needed to use an AUX cord to connect to the car which is fine and to be expected.  I just would have figured they would have decided to make this cleaner. Why have the cords come out the side of the device?  If this will be hooked to a vent the cord hookup needs to be on the bottom or the front.  Now cords shoot out the side for 6 inches then flop down around the ground.  They get in the way of the volume button if placed on the driver vent and get in the way of the passengers footwell if placed on the passenger vent.  Using a dual USB charging cigg lighter hookup will give you huge feedback into your speakers.  awesome so now I cant charge my phone and use the echo at the same time.  (PS this thing absolutely eats your phones battery.) I often end up giving my phone to my daughter in the backseat if she gets on the phone with her mom or plays games and instead of disconnecting the phone from the echo I just opt to unplug it because of how much of a pain in the ass it is. The volume... UGH pray to god your volume stays the same on your phone and or car otherwise you will lose hearing for a couple hours.  Long story short I have an Echo Auto for sale if anyone is interested because its sitting in my center console not being used since its an eye sore, tripping hazard, that has caused hearing loss.",1,1,2019-10-16,1,2,0
"Greetings, after waiting my requisite six +/- months for my Auto Echo lottery number to be drawn, I waited in great anticipation for my order to arrive!  I tore opened the package, grabbed my keys and headed out to my car to install my new 'state of the art' electronic gadget.  My life was good, I would now be able to ask Alexa how to spell chrysanthemum, while driving.  (Among other skills like the Animal Game, with my granddaughter)My anticipatory euphoria quickly evaporated, as I tried for over two hours, to connect my shiny new Auto Echo to my 2015 model car.  As you will read in other reviews, it will not install with conventional ""follow the directions"" wisdom, you will have to try various combinations of pressing source buttons on your car's electronics and Bluetooth pairings with your smart phone, in order to eventually get the unit to work.  Honestly, there HAS to be a better way to install/hook-up this unit, in a more reasonable amount of time.  Several times I was ready to call it quits and chuck the Auto Echo in the trash, but I do not give up easily and I was not going to let the unit's developers beat me!",1,1,2019-10-10,1,2,0

"Im a huge fan of Alexa in the home, I was an early adopter of the original and have added 4 more Dots to different rooms and my vacation home.The Auto version left me with a very poor perception.  It didnt integrate very well with my Bluetooth, in fact, Siri runs circles around it.  It didnt respond to texts and whenever I leave the car, it disconnects from the phone (which is expected) but when I return, it wont auto connect.  This is probably because my outlet has continuous 12v power on it, and doesnt turn off when the engine isnt running so Alexa Auto never power cycles.  It plays my Amazon music and iHeart but doesnt display the song being played on my radio screen like Siri does when I connect my phone directly to the iHeart app.  It frequently cant tell me weather because it cant connect or tells me that it doesnt know my location.  Pretty much useless at this point.",1,1,2019-11-11,1,2,0
I really wanted this product to be good but after 2 months of my use I’ve come to the conclusion that this was a waste of money and years worth of waiting. Here’s why:1. Set up took forever. it gave me no signs of progress so I kept thinking it timed out or something when IT REALLY DOES TAKE OVER TEN MINUTES to setup.,1,1,2019-10-29,1,2,0
"Since Bluetooth is a horrible implementation for reliable connectivity, the Echo auto falls short.  80% of the time I get the check back later message because I'm not connected.  I have an Iphone X and it connects when it wants.  I was hoping for a phone hotspot connection and I was hoping the echo would have its own speaker and microphone.  Its integration with my stereo is poor.  Loud pops and the responses miss the beginning of what Alexa says as there is a delay in switching the audio source from my phone spotify connection and the alexa connection.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Still needs to be perfected.  Maybe I should just try a Echo Dot in my car connected to my hotspot, that's basically what I expected.",2,1,2019-10-3,1,3,0
"I did not purchase this item, but received it free as a result of a Nationwide promotion. If I had to purchase the Echo Auto, I would definitely not and am oh so glad I did not spend money on it!We already own a number of Echo products and was aware that you can only stream the same music through the Echos unless you use Prime Music and Spotify or iHeart Radio etc. However, if you are prepared for premium Amazon music you would not have to worry about this limitation, but I am not prepared to pay extra for that. Nevertheless, I was hoping that they would change the above listed limitation with the Echo Auto. Unfortunately, they have not. This means that I could be listening to Prime Music in my car, but will be disconnected as soon as my child arrives home and plays their Prime Music favorites through their Echo. This limitation is what has impacted my overall rating.",1,1,2019-10-15,1,2,0
"The Echo Auto is a great idea in principle, but it's obviously still under construction. At this time, it's great at frustrating you to the point you want to throw it out the window.I call it my ""Your Echo Auto lost its connection, try again later"" device. Most of the time, it's incapable of establishing a connection automatically with your Alexa app on your phone. You have to open the Alexa app, unplug the Echo Auto and plug it back in, and then tell the Alexa app that you're a passenger cause, sure, Amazon, wink wink, I'm the passenger.",2,1,2019-11-2,1,2,0
"The Echo Auto is an excellent product but still needs a quite a few tweaks.For one the Alexa App needs to always run in the background on your phone, which causes it to draw power from the battery all the time. This also means that once you turn off your car and go into a store the app loses connection with the Echo Auto. When you go back to your car and try to get it to do something you need to open the Alexa app on your phone to get it working again, which one should not need to do.",2,1,2019-11-28,1,2,0
"UPDATE 11/27/2019: Not really sure why I am bothering to update my review since Amazon buried my first review  so deep that no one probably sees it (I am starting to think that reviews on Amazon are a bit of a waste of time). Funny...  before my review went live Amazon contacted me about the review. I responded to the inquiry, but never got a response back. My review was posted shortly thereafter, but as I said was buried so deeply that I doubt it was ever seen by anyone except for myself.My Echo Auto has been dead for over a month and will no longer connect. Resetting doesn't seem to do any good resolving the issue. I guess I will take it apart like I did the now obsolete Dash buttons or see if Amazon will repair.",1,1,2019-10-3,1,2,1
"I have been using the Echo Auto since delivered to me in July. I liked it so much that I requested a 2nd invite, which I received just days prior to the official launching.This device is not perfect, however considering the low cost and overall usefulness, it is a good product IMO. Many negative reviews of which I suspect some of the issues reported here such as ""Alexa constantly losing connection"", has more to do with requiring adjustments to the phone device settings, rather than the Echo device being the culprit. People having this issue can verify their device power saving settings are not putting the Alexa App to sleep upon being idle, etc. Another common complaint is the ""volume being too low"" requiring the the car entertainment system is jacked to 10.  User should check the volume settings on the device of which is running the Alexa App. Most devices have separate volume control settings for: ringtone, media, notifications, system. I have the ""media"" setting st to the highest level and have no issues with the echo auto volume. It is in sync with the radio volume, etc. Also, Alexa hearing you over the music playing, etc., may have to do with where the device is mounted. I was actually amazed she can hear my commands over loudly played music. I can almost whisper her name in the direction toward where I have the device mounted (overhead console) and she answers 99% of the time. I received the 1st order with the magnetic adhesive-backed mount, and the 2nd unit with the vent mount. I opted to secure the device using 3M Dual Lock Strips  (IPASS type Velcro).",4,1,2019-10-10,1,3,1
"Not sure on all the negative reviews, the product works off of your phone service and bluetooth as well.  Not saying the problem is narrowed to JUST that but something to consider.  For me, the device works well; had an issue on connecting for the first time but after a few minutes or so I understood and there was no need to try and connect the car media to the alexa.  The issue is when my service dips or my bluetooth to my car is a pain in the ass and then it just becomes decoration.  For the aux part I did try it. It connected automatically every time I just don't like all the wiring (yes adds one more wire ohhhh big deal but for me less is best).  I haven't used the GPS part of it just call, text, music, questions, audible and reminders.  The product every now and again has to be connected via alexa app so I have to wait a bit before leaving anywhere to see if I need to connect or not.  Not a big deal open the app push on not passenger searches for it and boom connected.  There are times when I call out and she will light up and then nothing or says she is having trouble connecting even though before leaving I know I connected her so with that I think it's my service and not really the device (T-Mobile over here) itself.  All in all the product works fine for my needs.  It does have a dash thing which is in my main car and I place it every time, haven't had issues what so ever it fits snug on the vent and the base is magnetic so falls into place every time.  I don't leave the product in the car (it even states not to) so when I am at work I connect it and use her here via thru my phone which is a bonus for me pocket alexa where ever i go long as I can plug it in.  I love it and feels very convenient for me and my kids since I am so plugged into all the amazon items so far happy customer over here I think it does well for the first of it's kind in the echo family!",5,1,2019-10-3,1,2,1
"Come to find out, you have to go through the effort of having the Alexa app running on your phone each and every time before the hardware device will work.So instead of just turning on your car, waiting for the device to chime and then talking to Alexa, you have to stop and ensure that the app is also running on your phone.  If I'm going to tap into the folder and then tap to launch the Alexa app, what do I need the hardware device for?  Once launched, my phone can simply listen for my ""Hey Alexa"" commands, right?  And even when I launch the app, I've sometimes got an error where the Alexa app cannot communicate with the car.  (But the Bluetooth connection is established!)  ARGH!",2,1,2020-7-12,1,2,0
"I really like the Echo auto when it functions, but it has trouble connecting at the start of a trip. About half the time, I have to pull over and 'open the Alexa app' by hand on my phone to get the Echo Auto to hook into my phone. This is annoying. The Echo Auto takes 2-3 blocks to turn itself on and realize it isn't connected. This is a bit too long to sit idling in my garage.On those occasions when the Echo Auto connects without help, it's great. The response time is a bit slow when I ask it to play a particular artist, but it eventually manages to start playing music. I think the device is better for longer trips. On short, city trips you'll spend a lot of time waiting for it to connect or restarting the app to make it work.",2,1,2020-1-27,1,2,0
"What I liked:1. Good quality construction, small size, lightweight, wake word sensitivity, aux connectivity",2,1,2019-10-1,1,2,0
"First off this is a completely have baked products that Amazon didn’t even bother putting any effort into making. With my eight other echo devices, I can at least change the wake word to four different possibilities, and while that’s limited versus Google home, at least it’s an option. Unfortunately with this device you can’t change the wake word, which is ridiculous because I use a different wake word (“computer“) on the rest of my echo devices, but this one is fixed with the word “Alexa.”  This obviously makes things very confusing. Apparently Amazon made sure you can’t change the wake word because they wanted to keep things simple. How is it simple that every device I own by this company uses a different week word and I can’t change the wake word on this device?  Constantly forgetting that I have to use a different wake word making it more distractive not less distracting!Next thing constantly disconnects on iOS, you have to keep the alexa app open, the screen on, and not go to any other apps on your phone. The moment the Alexa app goes into the background device app disconnects.  The thing never stays connected more than 15 minutes for me, and I constantly get the device is not connected all the time when I try and use it. It’s basically useless.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,1,1
"Within days of posting a negative (2 stars) review of the Echo Auto I received a call from a wonderful Amazon tech rep.  Within about 30 minutes she had me up and running with my major Echo Auto issue resolved.  The Alexa App would not allow me to establish a communications profile so essentially no capability to make telephone calls. Other reps had tried and failed, but this time I really got the A-Team.  Thanks once more for the great service!  Now for the review part.  We use Alexa in pour house pretty extensively, so it seemed like a good step to extend those capabilities to my old Toyota Truck with late 1990's audio technology.  Setup went quickly and the air vent mount holder does a good job of holding the device in place.  I'm not a fan of the cords you have to run to a power source.  A lightweight, more flexible cord would be more desirable, or how bout a rechargeable battery?  The cord is just too easy to snag and is unsightly.  My biggest complaint though is that the Echo will not automatically pair with my iPhone.  I have to open the Alexa App each time I enter the vehicle and manually connect the two devices.  A minor inconvenience, but the old BT-FM transmitter I use to connect my phone to the stereo gets the automatic connection part right every time.  Now, you might be asking why I need Alexa if I already have Siri on an iPhone?  I typically use both ""assistant"" services at home and in the car.  Both offer access to different music streaming services and both can sometimes be as dumb as a rock, though not often at the same time.  Alexa has also seemed to get smarter over time, while Siri seems to have the capabilities it did 3-5 years ago.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0

"Learning curve in setup. HORRIBLE directions. BUT, once setup, works great.I purchased during invite for $25. This is NOT worth $50 until they have solid directions, troubleshooting, and work out the kinks. As of yet, with the many, many, many times we reset it via Amazon troubleshooting of unplugging for 45 seconds then opening Bluetooth and choosing Forget This Device, once plugged back in, Alexa Auto never displayed the Orange Setup Bar on it’s own - we always had to press the Action button for 8 seconds, it lacks appropriate connectivity during Setup only (as of yet).",4,1,2019-10-4,1,1,0
"The Echo Auto is just a Bluetooth Microphone, it does not have any functionality built in. When it works it does everything my home Echo does.It needs to be connected to both your vehicle and smartphone at the same time. You can connected it to your car via Bluetooth or an Aux port, but you can only connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth. You also need the Alexa app installed on your smartphone. The app needs to be running in the background all the time. Both Android and iOS smartphones manage battery usage and will automatically stop the app from running in the background. You will have to change your smartphone settings to remove the app from battery management.

"I've had this for a while now, having been invited to be one of the early buyers. I was super excited about it because our family van doesn't have Bluetooth. It has been okay. The setup wasn't as bad for me as it was for some of the other reviewers, and I don't have trouble with it staying connected. I like the idea of it connecting through my phone; I just wish it worked better. Sometimes Alexa just can't handle the instructions I'm giving her (directions, play podcast, audible, etc.), and then I have to do the thing on my phone, nullifying the handsfree benefit. It's also really irritating that it won't connect to my Spotify through my phone, for some odd reason. When I open Spotify on my phone and play something, it plays through the van's speakers, but she won't do it for me.I don't regret buying this, and I use it all of the time. I wish it worked better. Also, why it doesn't just mount directly into the auxiliary power outlet is a mystery to me. Why the cord? I don't need Alexa on my vents or dashboard--seeing her is way less important than hearing her. Additionally, that vent clip is worthless.",3,1,2019-11-29,1,2,0
"Not quite sure where to start, but how about here? I have an Echo in my kitchen, and Echo Show 5 in my office. I drive a 2018 Toyota Camry with Toyota's Entune suite of apps installed, which has native Bluetooth. So, A) I know how Echo works, and how to talk to Alexa. B) Also very familiar with Bluetooth pairing (which I've do in the car with my iPod touch). I have the latest and greatest Samsung Galaxy android phone.When my Echo Auto arrived, the first order of business was to download the Alexa app. Then, I had to pair the app with Bluetooth on my sound system. From that point on, I spent quite a bit of time with Amazon's tech support. While the Alexa app showed as paired on my phone, so was the Entune app. This seemed to cause some sort of conflict. Entune was bigfooting Alexa, and Alexa was not responding. The Amazon tech had me try to connect Echo to the sound system with the 3.5mm aux cable. Still no luck. After over an hour of back and forth and trying different things, the tech had to go to a meeting, and said they would call back when done.",4,1,2019-10-5,1,1,0

Went to BB store and young fella who was SUPER familiar with Madame Alexa AND FORD Bluetooth systems figured out that my "" sync "" was not active.  He shut the whole thing down -then- turned my cellphone Bluetooth, Sync and mobile data on.  Then Madam Alexa began to cooperate.  It took waaaaaaaayyyyyyy to long to get this echo auto working.

Heck, I was SO excited about this, that I’ve been pinging Amazon regularly, since they first sent out a notification of this, wanting to make sure I got in on the beta program...and bought it the MOMENT I was finally sent the coveted invitation for one.Unfortunately, there are a couple of major issues with it.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,2,0
"The first issue I noticed was that this requires that Alexa be running on your phone at all times.  Rather than just connecting with Bluetooth like most apps, if Alexa isn't running you can't use the device at all, to just play music, books, or handle phone calls.  My Moto G5+ normally will run all day and have at least 60% battery left in the evening, but after setting up Echo Auto I noticed the phone was warm, and Alexa had used 11% of my battery despite not even having been connected to the Echo Auto since setup.  If you allow Android to optimize battery use for Alexa, it won't connect and is a hassle to have to start Alexa and get reconnected.I've been using a Bluetooth adapter for the audio system on my '06 Prius, connected via FM or AUX cable, and it works great...integrates with my Android phone, plays music/podcasts, navigates, finds food or gas, etc, but to communicate with the Google assistant you have to press the button on the Bluetooth device first.  While that's not much of a problem, I thought this Echo may make voice-only operation possible, but it just complicates things, and is very limited in what it can do.  It can't open or use any apps or music/books stored on my device unless it's via Spotify or Audible.  I can't listen to NPR news through the NPR One app, or do much of anything that's not Amazon-related.",2,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"For voice recognition it definitely didn't have any difficulty except it recognized any voice from anyone anywhere in the vehicle. Our six-year-old daughter could yell out a request from the back seat changing whatever it was that was going on with the Alexa currently, annoying the driver and of course myself.This is obviously a device much better suited for a one person car. And since we have an older vehicle that didn't have a Bluetooth connection it was also rather difficult in attempting to get it to play. We had to use a personal speaker it never played through the speakers within the vehicle.",2,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"I’ve wanted an Echo in my car forever, and I was thrilled when I saw Amazon was coming out with exactly that. If you have a newer car, you’re in luck; if you have an older car, not so much. We have one of each. The Echo Auto works great with my husband’s 2015 Toyota Sienna OEM system, letting you change music, and also doing all the usual Echo things, such as telling you the weather, adding items to your grocery list, etc.But I have an older Toyota Camry with an addon-Pioneer Bluetooth stereo, and the Echo works somewhat with that system. I can do the usual add items to my grocery list, asking for weather, etc., but playing music bring up only silence while the stereo acts as if it is playing music. I believe it’s simply that my car and system are too old, so I’m considering upgrading my stereo to one that works better with the Echo Auto.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,2,0

"I missed Alexa when I was driving and thought his would be great, but somehow it's not.  Mostly I wanted Alexa in the car to answer random questions while I listen to other things (or nothing at all) but it's not possible to use the device's built-in speaker.  I either have to use the AUX jack or pair it with my radio (and switch over to the applicable setting each time) OR direct the audio to come out of my iPhone's built-in speaker, which is what I have chosen to do for now.It paired with my phone and my car radio fine although it seems to take a while to get going when I first start up.  Navigation directions still require physical interaction with my iPhone but Alexa will at least tell me where I am when I ask.  Beyond that I haven't asked her to do much more because I don't especially like listening to her out of my iPhone speaker.",2,1,2019-11-2,1,2,0
"I put this in a 2010 Hyundai Accent. No bluetooth, base model car, absolutly nothing fancy about it. With that said, Alexa auto works great! Plays music on demand, brings up google maps, does everything on demand that my Echo Dot does. Everything I do at home, I can now do in my car. Very cool! I also tried it in my sister's 2000 Toyota 4 Runner, so old it doesn't even have an aux input, we used a cassette tape adapter in place of the aux cord and it worked great! Can you believe that?! An old school cassette tape adapter! One thing I noticed about most of the negative reviews: they all have bluetooth already in the vehicle. This device WANTS to connect to your phone. I think having bluetooth in the car creates confusion with the device. It doesn't know what to connect to.  Just my opinion, this device is best in basic older vehicles. People also complained about the cords. The power cord might seem annoying, but it's necessary. Having it's own designated power source means the device WILL fire up and start connecting the minute you start the car. By the time you have your seatbelt on, it's connected to my phone and ready to go. I love that! If it didn't have a designated power source, YOU would have to manually power it up and remember to charge it. Chances are, you would be charging it IN THE CAR! So what difference does it make if there's a power cord? The cords are barely noticable and the device is about the size of a thin pack of Trident gum. The vent clip is very sturdy and holds firmly in place.  People also complained about accessing their other music sources. Alexa wants to automatically default to Amazon music, that's it's job, to get you hooked on Amazon music. So obviously, Alexa is going to be confused when you want music from somewhere else. I only use Amazon music and it works perfect. Bottom line, if you want flawless operation and a sleek appearance... get a 60k vehicle. If you want a fun, cool, inexpensive tech upgrade in an older or basic car, get this device! It's a super fun, safe and convenient upgrade. Try it!",5,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"Even though it was thrown on my porch during delivery and did not initially pair and required a 2 hour service call with all kinds of resets, toggling of airplane mode, uninstall, etc.; when it finally did pair and start working it was a 5 star product. It did everything I asked and easily integrated with my Alexa environment. Was great to be able to play music on demand, add things to my shopping list, or turn on my home lights or air conditioner with my friend Alexa. My home is fully automated and my environment is controlled through 3 echo dots, 5 echo flexes, and 2 echo shows. Does not matter where you are just ask her and you got it. So it made perfect sense to add her to my car. That's why I didn't even care that setup was not as seemless as my other devices and my entire automated house for that matter. I wanted this to work and it did. For a week. During that week it rarely lost connection and nothing that a quick power cycle wouldn't fix. Then the week ended and the trouble started. Now she will say she's ready and she listens for the wake word but she won't play music. Ask her and she won't play it and she then loses her connection. Quick reset. Same thing. Pull over and full power cycling of all devices. Same thing. Works for a second. Said she's listening. Said she listens whenever I say the wake word, then I ask her to play music. And thats that. No more connection. Given how bad I want this to work again. I will perform tons of more things to try and fix connection issues but if I get to aggravated, it's going back. It was cool with the music and all but if I want to add shot to my grocery list or turn on the air, I can do it for free with alexa on my phone. I don't need a dashboard light that does nothing. Thankfully I caught it on sale. If I had this many problems after paying full price, it would have been returned as junk already. I'll update this to 1 star if I can't get issue resolved and send it back.I've decided to keep it with the hope that software improvements eventually iron out all the bugs. When it works it's a 5 star device. Want a radio station, Want to hear a specific song, weather, traffic? Want to add stuff to your grocery list? She does all that well when she's working, it was the raido station thing that made me decide to keep it. I didn't like losing my car radio because my car had to be set to bluetooth to get Alexa to work, but apparently Alexa can get me any radio station I want through various internet radio apps. If you use Alexa you will like this in your car but he prepared. It's quirky and needs occasional resets",2,1,2020-8-27,1,1,0
"There are a number of negative reviews for this device, and most of them seem to be user error or ignorance, not device defects or limitations.First off, be sure to check the compatibility list to ensure your vehicle’s Bluetooth capability is compatible with the device.  If it isn’t compatible, you can still use the device because an auxiliary cable is provided.  The device also has a built in speaker, but the quality is going to be similar to playing audio through your phone speaker in the car.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,3,0

First.  I love Echos and Alexa and have a device in almost every room in my house.  I was hoping to get a Studio for the holidays but will end up buying one if/when they go on sale.  I love everything Alexa can do from playing music to creating and adding to lists to setting alarms and reminders and maintaining my calendar.The auto does all of that but there are tons of quirks.  They include:,3,1,2019-12-26,1,1,0
"1st, it's important to understand what Echo Auto is. It is NOT a real, standalone Echo. It's nothing more than a bluetooth microphone for the Alexa app on your phone. This means, assuming you use bluetooth to connect your phone to your car stereo, you've got a bluetooth 3-way to negotiate every single time you start your car. Even on the best of days, everyone knows bluetooth is a crapshoot. Eventually, you just give up and don't bother with the 2-3 minute process to get it all paired and working.Remember the amazement of your first Echo, when you mumbled ""Alexa"" from across the room, over blaring music, and like magic she heard you? Yeah, The Echo Auto is NOTHING like that. Echo Auto is riding shotgun with your grandpa who hasn't changed the batteries in his hearing aid since the Clinton administration. Unless you're at a stoplight with the AC off and all windows closed, there's basically zero chance she'll hear you.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,1,0
So I am a little torn because I love this product I love the idea about it and when it works it is simply fantastic my issue is that I have to keep resetting it because it’s just stopped recognizing my phone several times a week. It’s sometimes happens while I’m on my drive it sometimes happens when I’m starting to drive So I am a little torn because I love this product I love the idea about it and when it works it is simply fantastic my issue is that I have to keep resetting it because it just stopped recognizing my phone several times a week. It sometimes happens while I’m on my drive it sometimes happens when I’m starting to drive(less annoying since I can set it up again before starting to drive). For example yesterday when I was doing about an hour drive somehow it could not recognize my device during two different occasions and I could not get it to reconnect without restarting the whole system and refindingit on my phone. I’m not sure if I have a glitchy device or if it is just because it is the first edition of these.What I do you love about this is that I can be completely hands-free which is amazing. I love being able to ask Alexa to play certain songs and tell me jokes and tell about the weather it is amazing. It definitely makes driving a bot safer and a lot more entertaining as we sing along to any song we’re thinking of.,3,1,2020-9-20,1,1,0
"Voice is solid, Alexa Integration is a nice upgrade to my car Bluetooth system. Sound is only 2 stars as I'm rating it on its own, as the sound quality will vary car to car based on your speaker quality. Amazon states Alexa auto doesn't work on 2014 Cr-V, but I have a 2014 CR-V and it works perfectly over Bluetooth with my Samsung Galaxy S9.Some key features",4,1,2019-12-12,1,2,0

I've had the Echo Auto since it was in preview and I gotta say I like it a lot. However this is not a full Echo device like a Dot or Echo.This is for all intents and purposes an alexa audio gateway device. I pondered how to configure it while I waited for it and the day of the install it just worked. Here is what I mean. Yes it has an aux output and built in microphones. The aux output however is completely optional. I have never used it once. It was powered on in my car but my phone was not connected to my stereo. I asked it something and the sound cam out of my phone.,5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
"I waited for a while to write this review. Like others, the initial connection was a nightmare, after hours trying to work with it, I stopped and just left it on. At some point (several weeks in) it decides to connect and now is usually connected when I turn the car on.Problem #1 - if your car has a control screen and you set it up for bluetooth to connect to your phone, you're going to have problems connecting the auto echo to your car. I think since they both work off bluetooth the screen doesn't know which to access first.",2,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0

"I'm going to start this review by saying this. This will be from the perspective of someone driving a car from 2010, that only has bluetooth integration with your phone. It has no other smart features other than that. If your car model is 2016 or newer, you probably dont need this device, as your car can already do what this does and probably better. Weather, Maps, GPS, Directions etc. However, if you car doesn't have that many smart features and want more, or are looking for the novelty of Alexa in your car and its compatible, I would still get it, but keep in mind, some features your car can already do, will do better than this device.So, I was initially skeptical of this device, but I thought it would be neat to have as it would essentially make my car a pseudo smart car thats Alexa enabled. Hooking it up inside my car was easy, as was the cable management, what was difficult was setting it up in the Alexa app. Now with my other Echo devices, setup was a piece of cake, getting setup done in just about two minutes. this one however took a few tries to get the setup correct. Just be patient with it, and it will set up easily. After the initial setup, having it connect to my phone everytime i plug it in and start my car was hassle free, and connects within a few seconds.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,2,0
"The Echo Auto just works. As soon as I turn on the car my phone and the Echo Auto connect via Bluetooth. It works like a home version of Alexa using your phone’s internet connection. The Echo Auto comes with a charger that supplies power for both your cell phone and the Alexa unit. I have had my iPhone X in my purse sitting in the backseat. Still, the Echo connects to my phone from the dash.You can have the Echo play music you have on your phone’s music library or from streaming services. This is my favorite feature. I live where it is illegal to text while driving for obvious reasons. But, if you’re choosing music on your phone what’s the difference? The police can’t tell when they see you fiddle with your phone from their vehicle. Hence, I love the the music feature. I can say, “Alexa play me a song by Led Zeppelin”. Or, I can be more specific like, “Alexa play How Would You Feel by Ed Sheeran”. With Amazon Music (the basic package is free with Prime) the possibilities are endless, and it’s all controlled by voice. This is very useful in the car. The car is my time-when I get to listen to my music.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,1,0
"First the setup. I have a 2018 Toyota Highlander, and a Samsung Galaxy Smartphone. At present, before the Echo, I already had Bluetooth Connectivity with Amazon Prime and Spotify thru my phone.  So why do this? It was free thru Nationwide Insurance.The setup was like all other devices, laborious and you wonder why they haven't changed, but I got it done in about 15 minutes.  With my Highlander, I do not need to have it on my AC duct, since the shelf and such is right next to the ""Cigarette"" lighter port.  Takes some getting used to having a ""Cylon"" like device staring at me.  Volume is tricky, but fine, (you must set volume on your phone and your car separately). Music works fine, no different then without it.",2,1,2019-12-27,1,1,0
"I registered for the early release of the amazon echo auto as I am already 6 Echo devices in. I have a semi wired house for smart devices including washer/dryer, lighting, cameras and TV so I was excited to have it in my car. Here is the walkthrough and rating based on my smart home experiences thus far.Setup: Easy. You pretty much plug the cable into a power source (cigarette or USB plug) and it’s ready to go, it comes with the cigarette adapter, you pair the the device with your smart phone (I have an IPhone Max and pairing came easily through the Alexa app. You add in a new device and it marks it as a new echo device). The device does have a mute button and I leave it muted because I hate it when it accidentally hears the activation word or something close to it and interrupts my music or directions. Another Problem with setup is that there is now a lose cable hanging in the middle of my dash. Include some cheap stickies to hold cables or maybe velcro. They are hanging which I do hate as more cables equals more mess.",3,1,2019-10-16,1,1,0
"Basically just a microphone array, the Echo Auto simply extends your phone's Alexa app to your dashboard with a wire. Yes, there is a bit more to it than that, but not much. Voice recognition isn't bad given road noise and music, but on occasion Alexa doesn't hear me correctly. The integration with Alexa is fine, as I mentioned it uses your phone's Alexa app so integration will be as good as the latest app version. Sound quality is only limited by the speakers you have in the car.If you like playing with inexpensive gadgets just to see what's on the cutting edge, for under fifty bucks the Echo Auto will scratch that itch. On the other hand, if you are looking for a well integrated hands free voice assistant for your car - keep looking, and let me know if you ever find one.",2,1,2019-11-3,1,1,0
"I picked one up on a presale, as my car only has weak integration with Siri, and I use a Pixel 3 XL.Setup was pretty simple, and the device is small enough that I quickly ditched the vent holder, and ended up keeping it in my center console.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"I really wanted this to work. Have been using an Echo Dot connected to my car's hot spot, but felt the Echo auto would be better as it had a smaller profile and would connect with my cars audio system.

Often I get the message that my phone has lost its internet internet connection, even though my phone hasn't.I also can not get it to work with the cars hot spot which is a pain as the car has multiple drivers. The Echo Auto needs to connect with the phone to work, which means who ever is using the car has to reprogram the Echo to connect through their phone, a real pain in the ....",3,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"When this worked, I loved it.  However, it didn't work very well.  Installation was difficult.  I spent a couple of hours trying to get it to work (I'm usually really good at things like this.)  got it working briefly, then it dropped and I couldn't get it to start again.  I told a 20 year old man who was doing some work on my house about it, and he gave it a try and got it working using the aux cord.  This left two cords hanging down on my dash, and guess what? It didn't hook up again when I restarted the car.  My car is a 2009 Mercury Hybrid, but it has Ford Sync and Bluetooth and I can hands-free play streaming music from my iPhone, answer and make telephone calls, get directions, find an address from the telephone number, etc.  I wanted the Alexa so I could add items to my ToDo list, set alarms, and add items to my shopping list while I was driving.  Also the ability to call out vocally to call for help without the car running appealed to me. I drive a lot and spend quite a bit of time  stopped in traffic jams.I called customer support for help, and tried everything the technician suggested and still no joy.  At this point I had invested about 10-12 man hours in trying to get it to work.",2,1,2019-10-13,1,1,0

Turns out to be a nice complement to all the Echo devices I have around the house.My car has Car Play so was not sure how they would work together.  While Car Play support could be better for the Alexa App, it does work and fairly well.  The documentation states that you need to connect your phone to your car either via bluetooth or aux port.  Turns out to be not quite true.  I have my iPhone connected to my car via USB port/Car Play and do not even have my iPhone connected via Bluetooth.  And everything works great.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"I've had this Alexa Auto for almost a year now and give it 4 stars. I also drive for a living so this comes in very handy. Alexa Auto could be better but I'm happy enough that I'm still using it. Just so you know my setup. I drive a vehicle with NO bluetooth only a radio that has an auxiliary connection via 2.5 mm audio cable. My particular set up went flawless and was connected to my Pixel 4 XL in minutes. Alexa was able to hear my every command and answer my questions just like my home Alexa. The best part I like is I now have Bluetooth connection between my radio, via Alexa, and my phone where as before I had to use a cable every time I got into my vehicle if i wanted to listen to music or talk on the phone.  The next thing I really like is being able to tell Alex to play music with just my voice and not having to pick up my phone. Another plus is being able to tell Alexa to give me driving directions without picking my phone up. Another plus is I now can charge my phone at the same time while listening to music or podcasts where as before I could not because I only had a choice of an audio plug or charging cable unless I had a dual charging and audio cable adapter.The downside is Alexa will randomly disconnect from my phone for not reason. The weird thing though is when my vehicle is parked in my driveway and I'm listening to my bluetooth speaker that I have in the garage and I unlock my vehicle Alexa will automatically connect to my phone and shut off my bluetooth speaker making me have to unplug Alexa from the power. All in all I'm very satisfied with it and has made my driving much more easier and enjoyable.",4,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"The device rarely connects and provides limited feedback when it cannot. I can stare right at the ""1 device connected"" indicator on my phone and the Echo still won't respond to voice commands. After I unplug and replug 10 times it might connects.When it does work, it's pretty good. Sound quality is excellent and if it does respond to your voice it's pretty useful. That's why it gets 2 stars. Too bad that is probably 5% of the time and the rest of the time I'm yelling at a flashing blue brick in my car. The music will also cut out in any sort of dead zone, unlike Amazon Music which has a buffer. So even though it's the same exact service, if you hit a dead zone even for 5 seconds the Echo Auto will die and you'll have to tell it to play again to get started. Oh and guess what? Since you're in a dead zone, voice recognition doesn't work so it can't even tell you that it can't play music because you're in a dead zone. I used to have my phone and Amazon Music hooked up directly and this was fine.",2,1,2019-11-8,1,1,0
"I was lucky enough to get this early, so I immediately installed it in my car.  I have a 2019 Toyota RAV 4 and I plugged it in, followed the installation instructions and was up and running with Alexa in my vehicle!  Great! Not really!  I listen to most of my music from a thumb drive and to do this I have to be in the audio mode of my car.  The only way that Alexa would respond to my commands is if I would go into the menu and switch to the bluetooth mode of my entertainment system.  After playing with it for about a week, I simply ignored it and left it on audio to listen to my music!  After a while, read days, I made a phone call from my car and when the party I was calling answered, I said hello, started  talking and then the person on the other end could no longer hear me!  They did hear me at first but then, not!  So I called back: The same thing!  I let it go, as I don't make many calls from my car anyways.  Then yesterday I tried to place an order to my favorite eatery, while driving home, and they heard me place the order, but before I could tell them who I was, they could no longer hear me, even though I could hear them fine.  I called back and I could still hear them answer, but they could not hear me!  I ended up stopping, placing my order, apologizing for what happened and waiting for my order to be complete.  I called my friend to let her know I made it home and I could hear her, but after a minute or so she couldn't hear me.  On a stroke of inspiration I opened my center console and noticed Alexa was on and the red band was fading  out.  I disconnected her from the system entirely and recalled my friend.  No problems!  Not sure what was going on except, maybe Alexa was trying to take control of my phone calls!  I haven't returned to trying to use it again, so if I do, I will let you know how it turns out!",3,1,2019-10-27,1,1,0
"This was an easily and seamless setup for my car. Everyone who was complaining about having issues setting it up maybe does not have a good phone, I have an iPhone 11 Pro and it took me less than 5 minutes to get this setup and going. I was able to set my home, and control Apps. I am hoping more App integration occurs in the future, like being able to control my Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV, Disney+, and Amazon Video. Right now I can control my Amazon Music and it does a great job of giving me hands free App control that my Siri simply does not do. It also responded to my request (Tests) for directions, weather, to call people, to add items to my shopping list, to create notes and add events to my Calendar.Overall I am happy and I think it's great.

"I was very excited and cautiously optimistic when I purchased the Echo Auto. I'd waited for years for Amazon to release an Alexa device for my car and thought it was such an obvious thing to do, so when this came out I was all about it. I didn't get it right away though and when I went to get it a couple months after release I noticed mixed reviews.After getting it myself and having it for over 3 weeks now I can say I love this product and while not perfect it is very good.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
"I bought this after seeing it in my friends car. I have noticed that it doesn't always pick up on what you want. It will typically always hear you, but it has trouble either finding what you want to hear or understanding what you want to hear. Sometimes you have to be extra specific for it to play what you want and other times you have to ask it in a roundabout way to get it to play what you want. For example, I had to ask it to play a certain soundtrack and keep verbally skipping to hear the song I wanted because it wouldn't/couldn't find it otherwise. And nearly everytime you ask to put the song to your library it tries to get you to buy it first. Which would defeat the purpose of streaming music to begin with. VERY annoying. Buuuuuut.......I still highly prefer it than doing things the ""old fashioned"" ways and it is useful. Just know that there are some kinks. It doesn't flow as smoothly as your home Alexa.I love that it syncs up fast and easy and is a lot better than doing things through my phone while driving. You can also charge your phone through it so you aren't draining your battery while bluetoothing.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0
"I have choice expletives for people too small-brained to learn how to use this thing, and I can't use those words here.Here's my experience: I paired it with Alexa on my phone, stuck it onto my dashboard, aux'd it to my car's aux and usb power comb, and said ""Alexa play something"" and it works after I open the app - every time since I got it months ago. Anything else and I would have returned it as defective.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,2,0
"I've had the Echo Auto for several months and it appears to be improving. Connecting time is getting better, does a reasonable job hearing your commands, though I've gotten into the habit of turning down the radio. It was a hassle changing my stereo input and interrupting my stations, so I have a separate speaker I put on the console of my 2014 Honda Odyssey.The interface with Google maps still needs refinement. I find it easier to use my smartphone in the traditional manner. Haven't played with it for awhile so I'll have to check it out to see if it improved with an update. If they nail that down I would give it 5 stars.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,2,0
"I was on the early list for his item. Now, having it for months, I have to say I really like it. My car does not have Bluetooth so I use an add on Bluetooth adapter that communicates with my radio via an FM signal. And, even with all of that extra connectivity requirement, I hooked it up with no problem. I should mention that it doesn't really add any functionality that isn't already available via the phone app. BUT, it is soooooo much more convenient than having to fiddle with the phone while you're driving. Each evening, I leave work and ask Alexa to set the thermostat to XX degrees. As I approach my house, I ask Alexa to turn on the front lights and unlock the garage door. After I respond with my lock code, she has the place waiting for me; warm, lit, and open. Also, my wife and I always seem to come up with a question while we're driving along. Hey Alexa, how old is …….  The only down side is, I have it on the side of my car console so that the cord isn't hanging all over the place. That makes Alexa a little hard of hearing. So, sometimes, I have to call her name really loudly. Other than that, I love the product.",4,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0
"Alright, first and fore most let's keep in mind this is a first generation device that allows you to control your smart home, phone, and other devices FROM YOUR CAR. What it is not is a majic wand to fix the worlds problems. Now with that being said it does have some issues I think they could've worked out. The mount is too big, and they should have created a window mount. The voice commands could be easier to use such as dialing from contacts, navigation, and the ability to complete two step processes. However, what they did right was making sure it was able it could seamlessly connect to the account you already have so you can control all your divices without a long process. It listens well and is responsive, I've been able to play my music, turn on lights at home and control devices from my car. The set up was easy and unlike others I have had no issue with it satay connected. Maybe that is an issue with Apple devices. My experience with it is that my music plays when I get in the car and resumes when my phone connects. The only issue I have after about a week is the mount. I did relocate it from the mount to and use double sided tape to attach it to my dash: it's look great and still functions as intended. Overall a great product and I'm glad I got it.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,2,0
well so I have an older car that dont have car play. this definitely is a game changer. after checking the reviews on youtube and this was only an invitation only i was skeptic so i have been using mine for almost a month and DAMN i could not be any happier. the signal is very strong no delay on the response maybe im in the city and practically i have full signal everywhere i go but damn this is the best thing for my car again IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER CAR AND AN IPHONE I SUGGEST TO GET ONE.UPDATE: SO i have been using this for 3 weeks i have not had 1 issues so far. now after reading some comments seems to be blaming Alexa. PLEASE BE ADVISE THAT THIS RELIES ON YOUR SIGNAL so you may have some delay however my area pretty much full signal everywhere i go and when i drove to an area with only 1 bar i get some delay. this is probably why some people having issues when using it saying it works sometimes and yet have no idea how technology works. NO i dont work for AMAZON just wanted to get that out the way. keep that in mind before buying. check out youtube reviews most of them complain about the signal their phone has. not alexa.,5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"Grabbed one of these at the 1/2 price, that price is probably too much, so think twice at full price.At first I loved the voice recognition, and I tried things from my car that I can do from my home echos: Drop in's to my home echos, telling my echo auto to control my smart home like close the garage or turn off all lights. Amazon music stations were cool to do with just my voice and it would then play from my car's speakers instead of my phones speakerphone like I used to have to do. Navigation was also nice, saying ""Alexa, navigate to..."" would confirm my choice and start/display Google maps on my cellphone while providing directions from the car speakers. My son also did his silly things like the read my mind skill and asking random questions that 1/3 of the time you get Alexa to actually be able to answer.",3,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"This thing rocks! I do not understand the set up issues people are having. If you follow the instructions, it works. You have to update the Alexa app - that is a must and it is in the directions. When adding a device, you need you select from the the Brand list: Amazon Echo (that is not in the directions but it was easy to figure out). Then you will need to click on the Echo Auto and there you will find your Echo Auto to connect to. If you click 'Other Device' when adding a device instead, it may not discover your Echo Auto. Your car radio has to be set to BT Audio (or something similar) - it does not just magically connect like it does to your phone. BUT, if it stays set to BT Audio, everything will work seamlessly. I only use one cord, I don't need the auxiliary cord. I have to admit it is glitchy, it can take a few tries before what you want it to do will work, but I imagine through updates the glitches will lessen. Definitely not a deal breaker! Once it is up and running it is wonderful! It plays my music, of course, from any of my apps. It makes calls! If you ask for 'gas stations near me', Alexa says the list of stations and then you can ask for the directions and she pulls up the google map on your phone with the directions started! All hands free! I love my Echo Auto!!!!",5,1,2019-10-11,1,1,0
"I have been using the Echo Auto for several months now, and I have to say I'm not impressed with it. I wanted to get the Echo Auto because my car has a terrible Bluetooth interface, and I thought this would be a replacement for that. Well, it is, but it's also quite pointless.The first issue I had with the Echo Auto was that I couldn't get it to connect for the life of me. I tried both Bluetooth mode and aux mode, and it just didn't want to show up in the app. I had to uninstall the Alexa app on my iPhone and make sure my phone wasn't connected to any other Bluetooth devices. Then my Echo Auto showed up, and I opted to set it up via Bluetooth, and well, let's say I had to reconfigure it to work with the aux cable because Bluetooth mode didn't work as I expected it to. Once I got it set up, I was ready to use it, right? Well, I ran into another issue, I use a hotspot device in my car, so I can always be connected to WiFi when I'm on the road. For some reason, the Echo Auto didn't function when my phone was connected to the hotspot. So I could only use 4G or LTE on my phone.",2,1,2019-11-10,1,1,1
"I like having this device, even though there are a lot of things I don’t like. I do not aim to make this a bash-sesh on the designer, but hope it helps improve future design. I don’t like that she came with an air vent holder. I don’t like my air vents blocked, I don’t like my air vents being incapable of adjustment, and I don’t like hot air heating up my e-devices. She seems to sort of magnet into the holder slot, which is fine, except she falls out of it often. Fortunately, her voice recognition is so good, that when I try to find her, she hears me and answers back (which is tricky because I drive a big truck and she can fall pretty far away from me).I don’t like that I haven’t yet figured out a tidy way to secure all the loose cords that are now dangling around. I don’t like that I have to log in to my phone to open the app to get her to communicate with me. I don’t like that when my Alpine stereo shorted out, she refused to speak through my phone. With the radio out, she was out too. I don’t like the way it connects to maps to give directions, so I HIGHLY recommend you just use your phone or a real GPS of your choice.",3,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0

I was using Apple Maps with Siri for navigation and using Echo Auto with Alexa playing music, listening to a book from Audible, listening to the news and weather on My Stories, etc. They both worked perfectly together! I’m am very happy I purchased the Echo Auto, I have 3 Echo Dot 3rd Gens and 1 Echo Show 8 in my home, so I love being able to “take my Amazon Music and Audible books along for the ride”, and to be able to access everything totally hands free, it was so nice to just ask Alexa to play music or read my book, and then to ask Siri to send a text or make a phone call. This device definitely helped make my 1432 mile journey more enjoyable and safer!  I will definitely recommend this device to everyone!",5,1,2020-6-13,1,1,1
"I have grown to love my Amazon Echo Auto; After having become so accustomed to, and reliant upon, my Echo devices in my (increasingly) smart home, I am thrilled to be able to add this functionality, and Alexa, to my non-smart car. My base-model Kia Rio came without Bluetooth and a very basic audio system. The Echo Auto gives me a Bluetooth connection to my stereo, allowing me to go hands-free in my car; phone calls through the stereo speakers, voice control of music streaming, instant access to my music library, GPS navigation; all so much easier and more convenient.Installation and setup were simple, due to clear instructions and quick walk-through provided by the Alexa app; I was up and running in fewer than ten minutes. As long as I have my phone with me, the Echo Auto establishes a connection within seconds of my starting the car. So far, I have had zero issues with this device's functionality.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"So, Alexa Auto. When it was originally released I was very excited for the possibility of having an Echo in my car. I was an early adopter and got the original echo, and have placed echos all throughout my house. The convienence of the echo was sorely missing in my car.I was excited when I got my email saying I was selected to  be allowed to buy an echo auto. I was excited. I placed my order right away.  It came and I went to set it up.. Only to find out that the bluetooth connectivity was incompatible with my car.  I forged ahead and tried it anyway, and had limited success.  The audio was scratchy, and queries would constantly get cut off. That said, I know that this was an ""off road"" use because for some reason my car was not supported.",2,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0
"I own a older Subaru Forester with no smart technology on it at all.I was invited to purchase an Alexa Auto prior to the release last year.  I opted not to buy one because I kept hearing from the earlier reviews that ""it doesn't do anything that a cellphone couldn't do.""  So I installed Android Auto on my phone and tried that for several months.  It was a complete disaster.  Android Auto would often stop responding to my voice commands which required me to reset my phone while driving.  When Android Auto did work,  most of the time it wouldn't hear me, which required me to sometimes yell the commands in triplicate (I'm not kidding here).  The phone itself was mounted on my dash vent not too far from my face, so it wasn't an issue with distance.  I even tried a new case on my phone, thinking that it might work better (maybe the case was interfering with the microphone?), but to no avail.  This all became very frustrating and I ended up deleting Android Auto from my phone and wishing I had tried the Echo Auto.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"First, let me say that I live in boonies and when driving locally service can be spotty but not enough to make me not love this product, my 9th Alexa. If you live in the city, you should have no disconnects. We have zero problems when we near the big city. Some people complain they can do he same with their phone (play music, etc) but we have Nest and Hue lights so we can turn on lights and adjust the heat with our voices, another thing you can do with Siri but I am not a Siri user. I am a die-hard Amazon fan.Nothing to do with the review but since it is almost Christmas I want to say that Amazon has made my life so much easier. I remember when I used to drive miles, maybe over several days, trying to find something I wanted or needed. Google, Facebook, Apple, Instagram, Twitter (I have finally weened myself off them)  do nothing  except gather my information. They don't do a thing for me. Amazon gathers information but somehow I don't mind because I get back. I love the magic of having something appear on my front doorstep. So Amazon, thank you for making my life easier. And more fun.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,1,0
"First let me same that this Echo Auto was free from my insurance company.  Didn’t take the time to read all of the fine print in the license agreement, etc. but I’m sure that they gave me this so that they can collect information about my driving habits.OK, so how does it work?  Pretty well actually, although I dinged them a star here and there.  Assuming I’ve got everything set properly, there is a very large difference in the volume level to listen to normal radio and that to talk to Alexa.  In fact, at first I didn’t think the device worked - just couldn’t believe that the volume had to be turned up so much to even hear it.  Nearly blew the speakers out before learning that I to push the button to switch the radio to “AUX” within an instant of starting the engine.",4,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0
"While it is a great idea. It’s annoying to use when you start up your car and take off. When your phone is connected to house WiFi and you start rolling , echo has issues connecting to phone again. I takes several tries and sometimes I have to cut power to the echo to get it to connect properly.  Drives me about insane. I’ve yelled profanities at Alexa more than once or a dozen times to get her to play a song.  Sometimes if I think ahead , I unplug the echo until I’m out of range to the house WiFi.I do have WiFi in my car , so it gets pretty decent reception. I have yet to use it on cellular data. Not sure if that works well. Also unsure if you can set the echo to just use certain networks( WiFi or data) that would make it easier maybe.",1,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"I was hesitant to get this device with all of the negative reviews, but I love using Alexa at home, and really wanted the convenience in my car.  I'm always wanting to switch from music, to podcasts to Audible while i'm driving, but I refuse to mess with my phone while driving.  And the Ford Sync voice recognition in my car is now 10 years old and it has no flexibility and is very slow to respond. So I thought I'd give Auto Echo a try (well, i put it on my Amazon wish list and got it as a Christmas gift from my wife).  It took all of 10 minutes to set up with my 2010 Ford Edge and my iPhone XS.  It just simply paired up nicely using the Alexa app on the phone and then, well it just worked.  In my experience it works as well as the echo does in the home.I was able to place the Auto Echo on a small indentation on top of my dash board and didn't have to use the provided vent mount. The cord runs down to the power supply provided with the device, and because it has two USB power ports, I was able to keep my phone charger plugged in as well.  The cord is not as annoying as I feared it would be, and is easily an acceptable compromise for how well the Auto Echo has worked for me. It blends in with the dark grey dashboard and is no more troublesome  than a phone charger cord.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,1,0
"I was very excited to get this device and I was looking forward to being able to do things in my car that I wasn't able to do before. I have Bluetooth in my car, but it is old enough that I still have to use my phone to initiate calls or set up music. We have Amazon Music Unlimited, so I was eager to tell Alexa what I wanted to hear and have her play it. I was looking forward to instructing her to call someone, and not having to get my phone out. However, this isn't what has happened. Unfortunately, she drops connection frequently, she doesn't understand me half the time (despite my speaking very clearly and loudly), she plays the wrong thing, she can't figure out who ""Mom"" is (even though that is how she is listed in my phone's address book)... lots of little problems that make her frustrating to use. If I just pull out my phone and say, ""Hey, Siri...,"" then I get what I need without the crap shoot. I was really hoping for more, so this was rather disappointing. I am hopeful that there will be an update at some point that will make this Echo more user-friendly, but in the meantime, it is a source of frustration.Also, the vent clip is rather large and not very useful. I don't use it.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,1,0
"I am not happy with the overall performance of this product. I have used this for a few months now and it is consistently disconnecting from Bluetooth in my car.

"Our vehicle is only 5 years old (2013) and my phone an S9 (2019) so I was rather surprised that we had such difficulties with it being set up as a go-between, between our phone and our car stereo system. We never had a problem connecting my phone calls through the car speakers until Alexa became the middleman. Set up took about an hour and a half to figure out. It should have been much easier but for whatever reason the configurations just were not connecting. In the few months that I've owned this, I still cannot figure out why sometimes I get in the car and turn on the vehicle and it immediately connects for phone calls and audio like it's supposed to. And other times, only the Alexa audio will go through but I am unable to use the speakers for my phone calls. When this happens I change the configurations and the connections in the Wi-Fi connections between all three devices, but get nowhere. Sometimes it requires turning off the vehicle and turning it back on and it magically connects.. It's a real pain when I get a phone call and I'm driving, and unable to figure out how to get that phone call to connect to the car speakers through the Echo. Obviously I will have to give customer service a call... as far as how the echo works in the vehicle, it's been kind of nice. I could put on any music I want camera and ask questions, can add things to my list, all by voice. The convenience is nice and we use this thing often. Now, I gave sound quality only two stars because we have a problem. When I tell Alexa to play music it puts it on so low that I have to crank up my speakers. If a phone call  or text comes through while this is happening, ouch! Notification sounds blast through the ears of even my daughter in the third row of our minivan - startling everyone. I really don't like how I have to change all of my configurations every time I get in and out of the van, and I don't do it. Which is why I get startled frequently when I'm using Alexa for music and notifications come through... of course in the coming years, disc Works will be worked out and this will be a far more seamless technology.",4,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"Providing an updated review.  Had the echo auto when it first came out, and as many had ALOT of disconnect issues, worst was starting up the car there would be alot of manual intervention to ensure it could connect (pulling my phone out, launching alexa app, etc etc).  Once connected it performed well.After collecting dust for a year, i've finally dug it back out.  the only thing thats changed environment wise is my phone (one plus 5t) has upgraded to android 10, and im sure the alexa app has gone thru updates as well.  So far its MUCH better -- works quickly after firing up my car.  No more having to dig my phone out and mess around to get it to connect.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,2,0
"The Echo Auto is my 3rd bluetooth car adapter. I drive a 2007 Honda CR-V, which is about a decade older than the new cars with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. The only way to access my music, podcasts, map applications and other useful phone functions while driving is through my car's auxiliary input.I first tried an Anker model and it worked well enough for playing music, podcasts or driving directions through my car stereo auxiliary input, but it started disconnecting frequently, so I replaced it. My second bluetooth adapter was called Boltune and it was a well-reviewed model that was in the top 3 bestsellers at the time I purchased it. Like my first model, it worked fine for playing music, podcasts or driving directions. Neither was good (or even useful) for making and receiving phone calls. I was constantly frustrated when calls would come in during my commute. I don't want to have to use my hands to manually receive the call while driving, so I was looking for a solution.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
"We absolutely LOVE our Alexa smart speakers at our house, have 22 in active use (4 Echos, 2 Shows, 1 Spot, 9 Dots, 1 thermostat, 1 Fire TV, 2 Echo Auto, 1 Garmin Speak, 1 smartwatch with Alexa) and even an Echo Connect.  I started with the Garmin Speak (dash-cam that also acts as a mini echo dot in your car) which got the job done, but for some reason was limited in full range of Alexa home integration such as for making calls or controlling things at home.  Now with Echo Auto it is the real deal, that can do everything your Alexa can do at home, and a bit more like trigger navigation on your phone.  But it isn't a perfect experience, with sometimes a hard time hearing you over noise, or limited by your phone's network connection.  I use it every day while driving to and from work.MY USE:",4,1,2019-10-5,1,1,1
"I have Dots in every room in my house.  I have often missed the convenience of having Alexa in my car or at work, where there is no WiFi.  I grabbed this as soon as possible.  Set up was a little confusing. The 2 cords, and not enough outlets for all my ""toys"".  I finally got it to work through my phone speaker in the car.  It will not work through the car speakers.  I realized that it didn't need the car to work, it needed my cell phone.  Armed with this knowledge, I took it into the office with me, and I now have Alexa at work.  Someone above mentioned that you can use a 2nd gen Dot in the same way, which makes sense and I'm surprised I didn't think of it sooner. I just didn't think to work it off my phone.  Anyway.  This whole thing would be a moot point if they would get the Alexa App to work and respond like any Alexa Device.  That would truly be an Alexa on the go, but maybe they wouldn't make as much money as they would be selling the devices.  There is no option to change the wake word.  A minor point but noticeable.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0

Echo Auto works great in my car -- I have it directly connected to the speakers with the included Aux cable, I did not use the Toyota's bluetooth connection.Anyway, this works great with home stereo systems!  I suppose I could just disconnect Echo Auto when I want to use it in the ranch, but a second Amazon Auto at the ranch works for me.  For power it plugs into a USB wall charger at the ranch.  Anyway, if you have a speaker system but no wifi, this might be the solution for you!  Of course you could also just use the Amazon Alexa app on your cell phone and connect your speakers to the cell phone but I like hands free use of Echo Auto.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I think this is a cool little gadget for the car! I received it as a gift for Christmas and I’ve had it for about 5 months now.First, here’s what I’ve got: I drive a 2013 Toyota Sienna XLE with integrated Bluetooth capabilities so the only cord I needed was for power. My iPhone X was already connected to my van. Also, I have a plastic disk attached to my dashboard from an old gps system. I rigged the Echo Auto with some Velcro to stick to that disk because I hate having things on my air vents. I realize this doesn’t work for everyone, but it made my Echo Auto look clean on my dash even with the power cord, which was important to me",5,1,2020-4-25,1,1,0

"I was one of the early adopters of the original Echo--an invitee--so I have a lot of experience with these devices. This version is surprisingly small, and with my Bluetooth car link, impressively responsive. It uses the same Alexa operating system that the other devices do, so what you think of it will depend on how much you like or dislike the Echo. It is small, easy to install, and comes with everything you are likely to need to hook it up. (It works through Bluetooth or 1/8 inch plug.) I used it on my commute home today, making Alexa tell me the weather, how far from home I was, sending a text, sending an announcement home, and phoning my daughter. I also asked some other questions which Alexa typically fumbles (and did in this case). I found that it was exactly as I hoped: Alexa had moved into my car.If you own the home product already, and like it, you will really like this.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0

"I've always wanted Alexa in my car. I have 5 Alexa devices in my house. I have use them for lists, weather and general questions. I drive a lot for work and frequently wanted to ask Alexa a question or add something to my lists, that I think of while driving. Since I do not use my phone while driving, it was great to get the Auto unit for Christmas 2019. It's like having an assistant in the car with me. I do have bluetooth in my car so I only have 1 cord to the unit. I have never had any connection issues and she always recognizes what I am saying. I add to my lists, play music and ask general questions. It has been flawless for me thus far. I've had it 3 months. I will say, it communicates with the Alexa app on your phone. So the connection is only as good as your wireless provider. I have Verizon so I do not have any issues with the connection but if your wireless network is weak in areas, this device will be too. I would highly recommend the auto and at the current price, I need another one for my daughter who will be driving in 5 mths.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
"So glad I added Alexa to my 2019 Audi Q5!  I use her as a personal assistant in my home office & now on the road during my approx. 700 mile a week rt to the Bay Area each week.  She readily accesses my google mail calendar, Audible, wikipedia, podcasts, etc.  No more pulling to the side of the road to start an audible selection thru an aux.  So convenient!  She will also give directions to the nearest gas, coffee or city.  Answers ?s on time, weather, distance.  Reads incoming texts & helps me send new ones.  Her only hiccup is sometimes she cuts off an answer to a ? after a few seconds or loses satellite contact under overpasses but rare enough not to be an ongoing annoyance.  I had no problem connecting...just have to remember I have to be on Media on the menu in order to interact.  Has made my commutes so much more useful/enjoyable.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,1,0
"I got this for my daughter's car.  Her car has navigation and an aux input for connecting a phone for audio.  She previously used blue tooth to connect her phone to the car for calls, but Lexus' interface really was not that stable.  This device works out perfectly for her because she does not need to physically connect the phone to stream music from our Amazon Music Unlimited account, and she can make phone calls or simply use Alexa to ""Notify everyone that I'm on my way home.""  This will send a message to all your Alexa devices including any TV's that are on that she is on her way home.  I imagine you could tell your Alexa device to ""notify your Alexa Auto to stop and pick up milk""  You can also make calls through the Alexa device to your contacts, or drop in on other echo devices.  You can play music through Amazon Music while you have your phone navigate you somewhere.  It fades nicely, and will pause the music when you get a call.  My other DD's car has Apple Carplay, and this is a close second to that, but Carplay does not have the ability to turn on Alexa enabled devices.  FWIW, my daughter uses this with her Android phone.  I have also paired my iPhone with it.  I will probably buy another one of these for my wife's car.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"This is not for everyone, but was what I needed. I have a 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder with an old head unit that has an auxillary input but no Bluetooth. I wanted to get a new head unit with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay but the one I wanted was $700 because there is only one model that the phone connects to the head unit via Bluetooth to access Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. All the others require you to plug in the phone which I did not want because I was afraid of forgetting the phone in the car. I would rather leave it in my pocket. And I did not want to spend $700 for an 18 year old car. So for the intro price of $25 I thought I would try the Alexa Auto. Though it would not give me the features of new head unit, I could at least get access to my XM, Spotify, navigation, phone and other apps on my phone, at a budget price. My other car which has a navigation system and Bluetooth probably would not benefit from this as much.First I tried to set it up with my new iPhone. I tried for over an hour, deleting the app, reinstalling the app, trying to pair it multiple times but I could not get it to work. I was ready to run over the damn thing with my car. Then I noticed that the Alexa app on my iPhone 11 was not working with cell service and required wifi to work. I guess there is a bug, either in iOS 13 or the app right know until the bugs are worked out. Maybe I am wrong but I tried multiple times turning off wifi and noticed that the Alexa app was not working. I reinstalled the app and still not working without wifi. Again, I was ready to run over the damn Alexa Auto.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,1,0
"I loved this Echo right out of the box.  It set up easy in my 2016 Ford Explorer, I read lots of features like purchasing from your car etc, poppycock, the best feature is the “drop in” it works exactly like the echos at home and you can drop in to any echo in your house.  So you’re late for dinner and your family is eating without you (again), so while you’re stuck in traffic you can join in on the conversation.  Traffic and weather checks are also great features. Controlling music unlimited playlists or audible books is also just as when you are home.The holder didn’t work well in my SUV, both in holding onto the vent and the magnet holding the device but I just placed it in one of the cup holders and it works great.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,1,0
"I am 82 and we have a 2018 Honda Odyssey with all the bells and whistles.  The only problem is that the Odyssey recognizes the voice of the driver when asked to call someone but does not recognize the voice of the passenger asking to call someone. IN COMES THE ECHO AUTO~!!  Whether I am the driver or the passenger it picks up my voice and makes a phone call without me having to take my hands from the steering wheel or my eyes from the road.  I also have my special list of Trip music and Christmas music on Amazon which it plays.  The Echo Auto is very responsive to a voice command and the music sounds great.  It also took me some time ~ as it did some other Echo Auto users ~ to get it synced with my smart phone but after spending an hour in the car, motor running and garage door open and wanting to say some four letter words,  I realized that I could synche it using my computer so in the house I went in hooked it up to my computer and voila it worked without having to sit in the hot garage.  I have also used it to DROP IN on my daughter (not call her but drop in) when I was almost to her house.  If we are going to visit any of our children ~ all of whom have an Alexa ~ they can drop in on us in the car through the Echo Auto to see where we are.  When my husband goes to the grocery store for me I can drop in on the Echo Auto and tell him something that I forgot to put on the list.  He does not have to take his eyes from the road or hand from the steering wheel to push any buttons to answer the phone ~~ just listen to the Echo Auto~and be sure to get what I need~!!!  It can also locate the nearest Italian Restaurant, gas station, Home Depot, etc etc.  The Echo Auto needs some adjustments and updates and I feel there are many many other ways to use it.

"The Echo Auto is a great step in the direction of hands free driving. I was invited to test this device(on another account that is a family shared account) and will share my experience below. While I am impressed with it, there are certainly lots of improvements that need to be made for it to truly be a must have device. I cannot compare this to the Anker Roav Viva or Viva Pro, as I have not tested them, but I am sure those work well as devices as Anker is a great company. I am pretty sure its the Software that is the issue. I cannot compare them to Siri also as I have not used it very much in my car so I will speak only about my experience with Alexa Auto.I do not own any Echo devices in my home except for some 4k FireSticks with the Alexa remote, lucky for me that is enough to be able to control my devices in home that work with Alexa. The Echo Auto works great for controlling my in home devices that work with Alexa with my voice in my car while on the move. Its very nice to be able to control this stuff without having to physically open an application and use my device to do so, I can simply tell alexa to turn on whatever device. It is pretty damn seamless and I have had zero issues whatsoever controlling these devices. I will say that these devices were already previously setup in the Alexa app I have installed on my phone previously even though I never really used it prior to owning the Echo Auto. Another great feature is being able to tell Alexa what music to play. This has been seamless, with little to no problems aside from Alexa occasionally misunderstanding the song I am asking for it to play(this is rare). Keep in mind the default app for playing music should be set within the Alexa application.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,1,1
"I bought the Echo Auto when it first came out, but I did not install it until about 4 months later. first thing I said after installing it was ""why did I wait so long?"" I was amazed! I can only describe it as if I had just hired a secretary/copilot named Alexa that can do everything that I tell her to do short of controlling the car for me. the Echo Auto can look for an address and then navigate me to it, turn on to an app like Pandora, YouTube, Spottily, etc., it can read my text, or write one for me, etc. in short it makes my driving time easy. A couple of things I don't like: one is where the power wire is located, it should be located on the back of the Echo and not on the side as it is currently, second thing I don't like is the mounting pad does not adhere to all surfaces, I bought an universal magnetic car mount holder to mount to the windshield, that fit perfectly since the Echo Auto adheres to a magnetized surface.",4,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0

Can't imagine this offers much utility to a modern car, although the voice response and features are as good as those found on all of the other Echo's out there, perhaps better as you are always going to be barking directly into this thing's grill from about 2 feet away, so it comes off as very responsive.

My phone is a Samsung S10+.  My carrier is Verizon.  I have tried the Android Auto app, but didn't like it.  Below are the pros and cons of this product based on my equipment.Pros:  My device came with a stick on the dash magnetic mount only--no vent mount.  It works.  It wasn't too hard to set up, but I do wish that I had noticed and read the 'Welcome to Amazon Auto'  email before attempting.  The music sounds good through the car speakers.  It's wonderful to be able to communicate with Alexa while driving.  Making a phone call using Alexa is easier than communicating with my car.  Alexa remembers where we leave off on our music playlist.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"Works great in my 2007 Chevy Avalanche to integrate my phone into the sound system with a bluetooth connection to the Echo Auto. The Echo Auto is plugged into the car stereo AUX (minijack) port.My only gripe is that the Amazon Prime Music when played by voice command always plays the same songs in the same shuffle order. I find it to be better to open the Amazon Music App and pick music from there. I usually play my music by genre and shuffle it, so it gets real annoying when the Echo Auto plays the same songs in the same order every time.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"After being on the waiting list for...like EVER, it has arrived! Overall this works as my home echo does. Although it is small, great things do come in small packages. I installed this in our RV. Simple setup just as the home version is. It walks you through the setup very well. Just a reminder, It uses your cellphones personal hotspot for it's internet connection, so remember to turn it on before the setup process. Unlimited data with your phone service may be needed unless you only use this device for short spurts. With the RV running, a/c blowing, radio playing at a level that rivals a rock concert plus all the normal noise of an RV going on, voice recognition was Great. My wife was able to have it respond to her about 20 feet away with all of the said noises going. Sound quality was good for our use, but I imagine if you are using a set of Kraco speakers from the 80's it may fall short of good. I.E. quality is dependent on YOUR system. I have read that some people are using the regular Echo as a replacement (money savings) for this, but I'm not sure it is made for car use. Can't imagine the home type will hold up as well and sound as good with it only using the regular Echo's speaker. Get the auto version instead. It was made for auto use (heat/cold etc.). Also, the auto version sounds great through your vehicles stereo if listening to your Amazon music is important.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0
"I really wanted to love the Echo Auto.  It does work, and actually has a few nice features.  It has a enough issues though to take at least a few starsPros:",3,1,2019-10-28,1,1,1
"I'm really pleased with my Echo Auto - it's everything I had hoped it would be. Alexa is right there with me during my commute and my weekend errands. On my work days, Alexa on Echo Auto keeps me up-to-date with the news, entertained with my music, and broadens my mind with books on Audible. All this while keeping me organized and reminding me of meetings and other commitments - both for work and for my family.Alexa on Echo Auto is easy to set up and connects to your phone with bluetooth and your car either through your phone or via an aux cable. If you don't have bluetooth in your car, Echo Auto will give your phone bluetooth connectivity to your car stereo for calls right along with all of Alexa's capabilities.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"I received an invite to buy this and was so excited to try it. I have an older car and it does not have any of the fancy bells and whistles that new cars do. I was excited to get rid of my bluetooth am/fm transmitter. Turns out that you still have to use the transmitter in older vehicles.  Be aware of this if you have a car from the early 2000's that may not have an aux input.After figuring out how to set it up, I must say that it works nicely. I have unlimited data on my phone so I am not sure how much data it will take up from your cell plan. The sound quality is good and the Echo can hear my kids yelling songs from the backseat (or asking for jokes).  The vent holder is useless. The minute the weight of the echo is place on it, it flops down from the weigh and the echo falls to the floor.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
My insurance company gave this to me for free. It was pretty simple to setup. Having an older vehicle I was excited to have it.However I have noticed the following:,2,1,2019-12-26,1,1,0
"After receiving my ""invite toy,"" I went out to the car and started to mess with it.  I had to back inside the house to retrieve things for it.  I brought my Samsung tablet with me because it already had the Alexa app on it.  I got it plugged in and set in the dash air vents, of which seemed a little hard to push in the vent grills, trying to take the time to make sure I did not break the grill or the movement direction. The device has a cutout for the usb cord to wrap around it so as not to be in the way, but not all the much friendly of a device to accomplish that.  I started the car and pushed the on button for AUTO Alexa.  There is a short course on how to set it up, and how to proceed.  The same thing happened here, as it does in your house.  The lights came on and  after running my Bluetooth on the tablet, it was a go.  My one draw back is that you have to have your car stereo set up for AUTO Alexa as soon as you get in the car, preferably before driving.  So that in itself, is like having a second car stereo without having your OEM stereo running.  I hope you understand that.  I have yet to figure out how to have one without the other.  If you like to listen to local radio stations, or have that favorite 60's station, then you will have to listen to it via Amazon Music or I heart radio.  I have Tango running via my tablet and that is good enough for me.  The sound comes through via your phone app, which is what it does via my tablet, so not having to worry about the data usage.  I guess what I am trying to say is what is the big deal, other than not having to reach out and touch something, (Voice control,,)  If you have a dedicated power source, then all should be good to go.  It's just that every time you have to make sure your car radio and your smart phone is set for Bluetooth, and your ""system"" is volume ready.  At least that is what the ECHO App is telling me to do...Other than that, oh yeah, don't forget to put it out of sight when out of the car.  The vent attachment has a magnetic spot where the little toy sets in.  So it will come off rather easy..",3,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"When my son got his license, my husband and I purchased him a new car-but no frills! No GPS or satellite radio.  We felt that these things are a distraction, especially for a new driver.  When I first heard about Echo Auto, I thought it sounded interesting, because it would allow my son to use voice commands instead of touching a screen and pressing buttons.  I thought it would be a great idea, because it would keep his eyes on the road.  There is no screen on the Echo Auto, it is strictly a box that you plug into your USB port.  Very simple set up! My son absolutely loves it! He can ask Echo to play his Amazon music playlists.  The music plays through his car stereo.  The other day, he was driving to a friends house, and there was road construction that forced him onto an unfamiliar path.  He asked Echo to give him directions to the address he was trying to reach, and just by using his voice he was able to safely follow the navigation provided by Echo through his car speakers.  He didn't have to pull over and try to enter the address into his phone mapping app, he just asked Echo! It gives me great peace of mind to know that he has the Echo Auto in his car! This purchase was worth every penny and I highly recommend it, especially for new drivers!",5,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"This is my first Alexa device.  I thought I would use it for tons of things, since I tend to spend a fair amount of time in my car.  Sadly, with the exception of having Alexa select my Audible audiobook (not something Siri will do) I didn't find  Alexa very useful.  In fact, when I would want to use it for on-the-fly directions (or whatever), most of the time it woudln't respond.  I'm content to call it user error, but Siri responds with no problem.  So....I was more frustrated by it than satisfied.  Plus, I'm not a fusser - meaning - I don't want to spend time figuring out why it wasn't working when I already have a device that does work.  I know many people that use Alexa in their homes and love it, but I wasn't able to find much use for Alexa in my car and when I did I usually wasn't able to get it to work the way I needed it to.  Aorry Alexa, I'll stick with Siri.",3,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0
So let me start out by saying that I was so happy to order this because I felt that the phone app using Siri To open Amazon Music was a little glitchy to start Plus it was an extra step to have to get Siri to open Amazon Music which then you could talk to Alexa there after.  It didn’t always register when And it would get me frustrated.So I decided to take a crack at it and Buy this device due to its $35 price point. I had no problem spending the money to directly talk to Alexa In my car without having to touch my phone. I have a 2012 G 37 just so you all know the features I have. This car has the USB in the center console box which directly connects and Apple iPod or phone to it to play music directly as a MP3 player. I have the echo auto hooked up to the lighter power supply under the stereo. The reason I have the phone directly hooked up to the USB iPod port is because the Bluetooth with the Amazon auto for some reason is not very responsive unless you have the phone hooked up directly. When you give Alexa commands in the car it is a delayed reaction at best. Most times it will not resume playing music once you leave the car and get back in even if you say Alexa resume music. Most times you have to really command Alexa to start planning a certain artist Or playlist. Which sucks because then everything starts over again and you end up listening to the same song down the road shortly afterwards. When do you leave a Wi-Fi area such as outside of your house or in your garage there is a gap of time where it will not play music because it Has to disconnect and connect to cellular. I have found once in a while that it does not disconnect but most times it disconnects until it finds the cellular signal. I also have an Amazon watch which seems to help when the music stops out of nowhere. Since the watch will list the tracklist you can press play or pause from that. I find success pressing play on my Apple Watch when I leave the car and get back in. Like I said for some reason it does not like when you leave the car for any amount of time. It tends to disconnect And sometimes just stutter random parts of songs when you get back in after leaving the vehicle. This is probably the most annoying part which makes me start yelling at Alexa.,3,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"I was SO excited to be able to be one of the first to try out this new product.  I LOVE my Echo Dots at home and thought it was genius to have the same technology in my car.  The product arrived in a box that reminded me of an Apple package.  It came with easy to follow and thorough instructions as well as a couple of different ways to mount it, a cord, and a plug.  I found it simple to connect for the first time.  I primarily use this to listen to my Amazon unlimited music.  I love being able to ask for whatever song, genre, or artist I am in the mood for.  I also love that I can ask Alexa anything while driving and my five-year-old son has enjoyed playing the different games it can do.After having used this now for a few months I am extremely frustrated.  I have had to totally reset and reconnect this device multiple times.  It's very aggravating to be in the car and try to ask Alexa to get some music on and get no response or get a response that Alexa is having trouble connecting with my phone when my phone is having no problem connecting to my car's Bluetooth.  Also, because I live in SW Florida my device has been overheated on multiple occasions and has had to take some time to cool down before it would function.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,1,1
"I received an invitation to purchase this and was very excited when it arrived.  We have SiriusXM in both cars and if this continues to work as well as it has, I will most likely cancel our subscriptions and save a lot of $.  I can't see paying hundreds of $$ a year for my 80's on 8 when I can listen to my own playlists or Amazon music.Set up was very simple, taking less than 5 minutes. Vent mount is included.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,1,0
"Roughly 90% of when I use Alexa is in the car. In the past I'd used either a Dot or an Input tethered to my phone's hotspot, which worked okay but was still slightly awkward. When the Auto was announced I was immediately interested, figuring it would give me the same functionality but more tailored to the car. So far, I can't say I'm very impressed. Disappointed, really.First, yes, it does work a bit better for certain car-specific uses. Getting directions, for example: that works fine, mostly, though ultimately it relies on your phone's map program rather than anything specific to Alexa. I could see how it would be a nice feature if you were frequently heading places you weren't familiar with, but for my weekday commute it isn't very handy, especially since there's no easy way (at least that I've found) to have it tell you more specific information, e.g. ""what's the traffic like between home and work?"" You can always look at your phone of course, but if I could look at my phone I wouldn't need a voice activated system now would I?",3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Since my earlier, original review, things have changed. As it happens, Amazon has reached out to me to help me with the setup process. It turns out that there is more to understand about ongoing updates to this application of the echo auto. In fact, the very process to do so is vital to the success of using the echo auto at all. You wind up updating the echo auto , the Alexa App on your smartphone to ensure the firmware is including patches for your install of the device to your cell and your car's Bluetooth (or Aux port). I would suggest, if you have any problem like I had, please contact Amazon fore this issue and they should be able to explain how to proceed with the updating procedure. It involves your need to have your echo auto device with power usb cable and AC transformer in your home and your cell/smartphone nearby. The updating procedure involves a few steps (first, then repeated one more time) and that may take about 20 to 30 minutes before finished updating. At least this explains what the brief notes in the booklet implies but doesn't go into detail. Good luck, I went through it twice before success. Good luck, I'm happy now. As for my second Echo Auto - I'm thinking a friend of mine will receive a gift of it. Hope she likes it.Original Review: Ah, you can ignore the rest here..... There's only one reason I give such a poor rating. This was a second purchase for the same device to see why the first one wouldn't set-up correctly. After doing more research, I found (buried in documentation elsewhere) that it will not work in my Honda Accord Sport model year 2015. This information should have been front and center on the product description page and in the cart page - instead of somewhere else in the Amazon Echo Auto pages. The only reason I am not returning the second, unopened, device is that I anticipate a new car in the coming several years. But for anyone considering this, you better look through the website pages for this product to see a list of vehicles that are incompatible FIRST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"Update 2: Shortly after Update 1, Alexa began to randomly ignore my call/ end call/ SMS commands. I know she heard me, as the blue light went out, but got no voice response or action on the phone.But today, much progress! Not sure which of these are necessary, but the Echo Auto seems to work reliably now that I have: 1) switched to the Google Dialer (Phone) app, 2) switched to the Google Messages app and 3) added Echo Auto to Trusted Devices in the Smart Lock settings (causes the phone to stay unlocked whenever it recognizes a bluetooth connection with Auto. I'll do some road testing for consistency, then post update 3.",4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"While driving I had frequently thought, ""I wish I could add that to my Alexa TO-DO list,"" so when I got the invitation to buy Alexa Auto I didn't think too long about it. Still, I wasn't completely sold until a couple of months after I got it, I got on the freeway to go to an appointment and an accident brought traffic to a stop. As it got later I realized I wasn't going to make my appointment, and it was one of those where you get charged if you don't cancel in advance, plus it was kind of important! I didn't have the phone number to call ahead, but Alexa WAS able to find the phone number for me AND place the call!  As a result, I was able to explain the situation and arrive 30 minutes late without charge, AND without sitting in traffic fretting about being late!  Alexa paid for herself that day.PROS:  I LOVE the fact that Alexa makes my phone completely hands free, as opposed to having to tap the touch screen on my dash. I also LOVE that with my phone and auto on Bluetooth I can go from listening to music on my phone to listening to my favorite station on Radio.com or asking Alexa to play from something from Prime Music -- No need to subscribe to satellite radio.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I read a *lot* of reviews before and after making my purchase, and was a little worried. I've gotten devices before that promised hands free talking in my car and they were garbage. No one could hear me over the road noise no matter where I placed it, and it just made more sense to use my phone on speaker which... wasn't ideal or very good. I made sure to set up my alexa when I wasn't in a hurry, just in case there were any issues, and really the only one I have is that the auxiliary cord is too short based on how my car is designed. An easy fix and not worth taking stars for. I had to turn up the volume on my phone to hear the sounds alexa made and then I called my mom with the air turned up, and was able to carry on a perfectly good conversation with her. She was able to hear me as if I was simply talking with the phone to my ear, and that's the best experience I've had with any device promising hands free talking in my car. I'm driving a 2010 Honda CRV, and while it still works I refuse to replace it, so the echo auto is wonderful to have when I'm traveling. I have more features to test out, but so far it's perfect for my needs and I'm thrilled with it. This is what I've been looking for for years now, and I'm really happy with the device. Hopefully it keeps working as I need it to, and if anything changes I'll update my review. If you're looking for a device that gives you the hands free experience you can't get in an older car, but you're not looking to get one of the newer cars that supplies it already, then this is for you. I'm afraid I'm not using it in a newer car so I can't talk to that experience. Hope this review helps! This really is a nice piece of tech, and definitely worth the money I paid for it.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I was lucky enough to get ONE of these during the pre-release period, for testing and review.  I’m glad I had the chance to really put this through real-world testing without paying full-price, and glad I didn’t go gung-ho and buy one for every vehicle (after their general release to the public).  First of all, If you have a vehicle with an AUX-IN or enhanced BT functionality, this will work well for you, but if you already have a vehicle with Microsoft SYNC, Android Auto, or Apple Car-play, you may find this unit disappointing or redundant.Pros:",3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I give the device solid marks for what it is and what it’s designed to do. Kudos to Amazon for making the smallest echo yet and getting it to work through a cellular data connection. I realize that I’m a pretty ideal user of this device for several reasons. If your setup doesn’t look like mine I can understand why you might run into some issues.My situation is a little bit better than most I think. I drive a 2017 Ford escape titanium which has CarPlay and a couple of “always on” 12v sockets right up front. I point out that the always on nature of the sockets seems to make echo auto work better. There’s never any boot up time to wait for, just a Bluetooth reconnection when your phone gets close.

I got invited to try this with the trial run. I have had it for just shy of a month. I would never pay full price for this device. The following are my areas of struggle/concern:1. It did not come with clear instructions; I have mine both plugged into the auxiliary port in my 2014 GMC Acadia and connected through Bluetooth. It will not work on the auxiliary port.

"In reading the reviews, I feel like some folks are either technically challenged or they have a phone/car that is contributing to the connection issues. On a Samsung 9+ in a Tacoma and Honda Fit my Echo Auto works effortlessly and sounds like a dream. Unlike my home Echo's, I have never had it misunderstand my commands. Navigation directions work like a charm and now I can truly drive hands free. Like other reviewers say, the mount is a little funky but serves its purpose. My only beef with the unit is the Aux out. I used the Echo Auto in a rental car with no Bluetooth and it was a real pain to use. The unit didn't seem to know to output to the aux jack instead of Bluetooth; and I had to turn off/on my phone's bluetooth to finally get it to connect. When I told my friends about it, a lot of them also said ""my phone/Siri/etc. already does that, why do you need Echo Auto?"" They said that until they actually experienced it, and the all got themselves on the waitlist that day.

Yes it would be nice to not have use two plugs but I don't have a blue tooth car.  But hey, now I have my own music! Definitely a win for me and I really appreciate the Beta price I got it at.  Another thing that I like is the tiny foot print.  It's smaller than a smart phone and I just put it in a side purse pocket when I go in a store (don't want to leave it in the car).  And also since it is a echo device you can ask Alexa anything you normally would at home.  Temperature, sports stats, what time does a restaurant open, make a call etc.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0

"(First, check out the Echo Input -- it *might* work similarly to the Echo Auto, and be cheaper. I only discovered it after getting my Echo Auto.) That said, I am very pleased with my Echo Auto, with only a few quibbles. I VERY MUCH like being able to use voice commands in my car, to play certain playlists or audio books without having to look down at all.  I like being able to ask my usual style Alexa questions: How is my commute?  What's today's date?  Like that. I appreciated that the power plug (that goes into what used to be the cigarette lighter, back in the day) has TWO USB plugs, one for my Echo and one for anything else I might need.My QUIBBLES:  1) The way to mount the Echo Auto to the air vents is just awful, at least in my Kia Soul. It kept falling off. Also, I live in Texas, where I don't want *any* of my air conditioning blocked by anything, even a small device like this. I ended up just leaving l'il Alexa in the tray in front of my gear shift, where it hears me fine, though I need to wrap up the extra cord.  2) I had really hoped I might be able to send hands-free text messages, or read text messages while driving, but all Echo Auto can do is RECORD my message and send it as an attachment. That's not especially convenient for the recipients. 3) Is it my imagination, or does Alexa take longer to respond to my voice commands than at home? In the car, my commands often go like this:",4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"and so far, so good.  I have to say that I had reservations about this purchase because I felt that I really did not need another Alexa product.  However, I did not think that being able to do a lot of the same things that I do at home would be that big of a deal.  But it has with one of the biggest being reminders and adding things to my shopping list. I don’t know how many times I have been driving and I would remember something that I knew I would forget before I arrived home; or I thought about something I needed to buy at the store that I also knew I would forget by the time I got there. Now, I can just ask “Alexa” to “remind me” or “add to my shopping list.”  Not to mention, there are so many more hands-free task that I can complete such as turning on the lights before I get home; changing the temperature before I arrive home; checking in via echo spot before I get home. These are things I would have had to have pulled over for and pulled out my phone to use the apps.  It’s just been great. Also, I can easily navigate between radio stations; request podcasts; ask for specific songs.  It’s almost like being at home. The only thing I cannot do is view anything for obvious reasons.As for the set up, I didn’t even set it up in my car. I set it up in my home and then when I left for the day, I plugged it into the 9 volt outlet, turned my car radio to the specific setting and it worked like a charm.

Only thing I can't quite get used to is when you talk to Alexa, it takes 1-2 seconds to respond allowing me to make a command (unlike the indoor version what responds immediately on the wake up word.  Really cool is that it knows where you are, so you can ask for the weather and it reports on where you are (not your home location).

Driving an RV is a two handed and often white knuckled adventure, so voice commands certainly help alleviate stress...and this delivers perfectly, it can even hear me over the engine at my feet (lots of in cabin vehicle noise).Certainly not for every situation, but for the right use case it's a perfect companion to drive with!",5,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0
Set up has issues.  When you first get into the car the unit has issues sometimes connecting to the phone.  Sometimes it disconnects and you dont even know it until you try to talk to her.The ac/ vent clip is totally useless. I ended up using velcro to attach it to my dashboard which seemed to make the disconnect issue even worse.  This was a fantastic idea in thought but poorly implemented and not beta tested long enough.  I love echo products and have more of them then I would like to admit and was so excited when I was selected to be part of the trial.,3,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
Pros: You can access Alexa via voice-control on a car that doesn't have Alexa access pre-installed (like I've noticed some of the newer cars are advertising that they do).Cons: It really doesn't add that much value to the Alexa experience - even in the car.,3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
Pros:-Great to use hands free to start music and  answer calls. We don’t have Bluetooth in our car so this is amazing to have!,5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"Good idea, extremely poor execution. The issues are:1) Every time I get into my car, I MUST unplug an replug it back into power for the echo auto to connect to my phone. If I do not, the light just stays red.",1,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"Seems to be a great ideal but needs some improvement. I love the size of it its perfect and easy to hide. I received mine in November and have been using it in the past few (cold) months and I have a lot of connection issues. The connection issues cold be due to the cold weather or my truck 2015 Colorado. Its not like the echo because its only powered on when your car is on and takes a few minutes to connect to your phone. sometimes it doesn't connect then i find myself turning Bluetooth off and back on or fiddling with my phone to get it to connect. this is why i don't like it. don't expect it to perform like the echo, you walk into the room and say Alexa ""what time is it"" and she responds instantly. when it connects properly and actually hears you yes it'll work just like the echo however you have to keep in mind that its being powered by your car which once powered on it needs to find and successfully connect to your phone. Newer cars are coming with it built into the car and i'm sure that is much smoother and similar experience like echos. Overall i would give it 3 stars because it either doesn't understand what im saying at times or hear me, and it could take afew mins to connect to your car. I do like it when im listening to music and can just say alxea play .... or skip song, and not remove my hands from the steeling wheel! Overall i would pay $25-30 but i personally think $50 is a lot. I got to participate in an insurance thing and it was free for me so i gave it a shot. Amazon customer service is great and if you have any issues they can assist you don't be shy to reach out after all we all pay $150 a year to be a member of prime.",3,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"So I got the invitation and purchased Echo Auto and a vent mount.  I really didn't want another cord on my dash, so I plugged it into the cigarette lighter plug inside my center console and I just leave it in there and shut the lid.  It doesn't seem to have any difficulty hearing me in there.  Echo Auto works like any other Alexa product  with its good and bad points, except this one has a button to turn the mics off for privacy.  No need for satelite subscriptions, I have Amazon Music Unlimited and so I can have any music I want play through my speakers. You can also listen to podcasts, news, talk radio, just about anything. And if you like a particular over the air station, you can use her skills to listen live.  For example I tell her to get me Nash FM 103.7 and viola, I am listening to my morning radio show.  you can also ask for directions and she will activate your phones GPS progrom.  She will also tell you nearest gas stations or restaurants, etc. I My truck has hands free for phone calls but Alexa works much better.  I just ask her to call whomever.  I can even have her send a message, read a message or reply to a message just by verbal commands. A small problem I have run into is that sometimes I will be using WAZE or GOOGLE Maps for directions and I will ask Alexa something and the GPS will speak up giving me directions at the same time and Alexa gets confused trying to listen to me and the GPS at the same time, lol. You just need to make sure that the GPS isn't about to speak before you start speaking to Alexa. Overall I find it very convienient having Echo Auto.  Even though my cell phone has a built in Alexa, this is just easier and more convient.  I just hop in my truck and my phone, stereo and Alexa just work together. It is easier if I wait until I am down the road a few minutes to give my phone time to switch from my WIFI to my Data if not you will likely get Alexa saying that you do not have a internet connection. If this happens, just wait a little and give the command again.",4,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"I was so excited to get this! I kept trying to buy it and it would tell me I couldn't, so when I finally got the email that I was invited to purchase it, I jumped at it.Of course I understood that when I was purchasing it, I was also buying a product that may not be fully formed and was probably paying to do some late in the game beta testing.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"Voice texting will no longer be supported come March 2020? Why did I buy it then? To have a glorified mp3 player?! I stopped using Google Assitant/Android auto because it did not ""play nice"" with echo auto. When I switched, I lost the ability to have navigation show up on my car screen. I dealt with that so I could have the voice call & text along with my music. If I continued using Android Auto I would have to ask ""Alexa"" 3 to 5 times to play a song. Now voice text will no longer be supported unless others in my contacts are signed up for Alexa communications? There was a time when tech companies were innovators. They would get you to buy their stuff because it was great gear, now it seems you are forcing the end user and anyone connected to them to use your ""service"" or else. Bad move. May have to unregister my devices and sale them on FB Marketplace or Craigslist. Very bad customer service Amazon. Update: just received a call from customer service and the gentleman was very pleasant. He seemed genuinely concerned about the complaints I have about the device. He stated that the lack of support for SMS was supposedly only for other devices and hopefully was going to stay active on the echo Auto. He told me that his department is in contact with the Department that handles that portion of things and they are trying to resolve the issue, or at least get a definitive on what the final outcome will be. All in all I do enjoy the device and its capabilities. I will say that I still have reservations due to its inability to display my map on screen in my vehicle. I hope they get the SMS issue resolved. Because I do enjoy using my echo Auto, I do like it more so than Google Assistant.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I waited a good long time before posting this review. I wanted to be sure I knew and understood the Echo Auto (""EA"")  before commenting.  First, it's just awesome to ride around with Alexa.  She does everything in my car she does at home . .and more.  EA fits neatly in my center console out of site and her mike is sensitive enough that she hears me in there even over my music!  Like most cars today, there's a USB outlet in my console, so she is powered up as soon as I get in the car.  EA does not operate on batteries so you will need to plug it in to your USB or other auto power source. EA works with Alexa on your phone . .  so be aware that you are always using data with this device when on the road. But that said, if you have an unlimited data program, then who cares right! EA makes phone calls from my contact list on my phone  . . . she tells me my schedule . .  finds great restaurants . .  tells me movie locations and showtimes . . . l give me directions and navigate using your phone's screen . . tells me jokes when I am board . . plays my music from Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify . . literally everything you can do with Alexa at home you can now do in your car.  The EA is small, rectangular and sharp looking, and she has cool LED lights that come on when she's talking to you.  The only two negatives I can say is that it takes EA a long minute to connect to the internet via cellular after its been connected via WiFi. So if you're at home and your phone is on WiFi, when you get in the car it takes a while for the Alexa app to shift to a cellular network and so a little patience is required . . . the other negative is unlke the Echo devices for the home, it does take EA a little bit longer to respond to the wake word ""Alexa"" so there'a a bit of dead silence for about 15-20 seconds . .  if I were an Amazon engineer, I'd fill that silence by having Alexa say, ""what can I help you with?"" instead of the ding and 20 seconds of silence.  Other than those two things I absolutely love my EA and will buy one for my girlfriend for Christmas as she love it too. Go for it, if you love your Alexa devices, you'll love this one even more . . .  Never drive alone again!!!!",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"I now have two Echo Auto units, one in each car. Prior to this, I tried the Anker Roav VIVA for in-car Alexa use, which was decent but (a) did not do a great job of voice capture in a loud car and (b) lacked access to certain services, notably Spotify (apparently due to some licensing issues). I was able to get the Echo Auto with the half-price early adopter deal. I have unlimited data on my phone, so I wasn't concerned with needing my phone's Internet connection to make Echo Auto function.As a product, Echo Auto works very well: setup is as easy (or not) as for any other Echo device, although as it connects to your phone via Bluetooth rather than WiFi for setup, you don't need to do things like disable mobile data to make the initial connection. The form factor (the flat unit attached either to the dashboard in my first Echo Auto, or on the vent mount for the second) is good, and the voice recognition/discrimination much improved over the Roav VIVA.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"UPDATED 12/4/19: Almost immediately after posting this review and stating that Amazon never got back to me on the issue with Alexa interrupting my calls I received a call from Amazon support. They apologized for not getting back sooner, and informed me that a recent update had resolved this issue, and how to update the Echo Auto device. Since the update I have not had the issue with Alexa interrupting my calls. I do appreciate them reaching out so quickly to resolve the issue. I've changed my rating now to 4 stars since that issue has been resolved.Overall, I still think in its current state the device is lacking a bit. As stated previously, I oftentimes don't hear Alexa responding to my questions/requests because there is no internal speaker response option. I would also really love to see more app integration that would be helpful during driving, like being able to place a mobile Starbucks order.",4,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"I have a 2010 Charger that has an awesome sound system but the radio stations in Florida don't play my kind of music like they did on Long Island(WBAB & others). So I was looking at the different ways to improve my mobile music. I had XM once before but is expensive for what I listen to. I have Amazon music & Echos at home so I figured I should give Echo auto a try. I enjoy shouting out songs or music suggestions to  Alexa at home so why not in the car. I heard from a family member that it's no good because it keeps losing the signal & returned it. Long Island cell service stinks so I wanted to give it a try. I got it in 1 day and it took a couple of minutes to connect it to my iPhone. The vent holder works great because the unit is so light. So I went for a ride and asked Alexa to play some songs and boy did she deliver! Not as fast as at home but still quick. The quality was fantastic! Crisp loud music, just the way I like it. It never disconnected and had no static. I was so good my wife wanted on for her car so that day I ordered another one. Now Alexa goes with us everywhere.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
I waited a year for this after I got on the wait list. The day I received it I was excited to try it out but my excitement soon turned to disappointment and frustration. I own multiple echo devices in my home so I am well experienced with echo/alexa and even use it for home automation tasks. I  realized that the Echo Auto was designed to fill a role/usage that doesn't need to filled and it is unnecessary adding complexity to the driving experience. Coupled with the fact that it never worked properly and wouldn't respond to voice commands it ended up in my glove box and has been sitting there unused. Fortunately I only paid 24.99 for it. I blame myself for getting suckered into buying it. I would put this at or near the top of worst Amazon products.,1,1,2020-9-23,1,1,0
"I really like it....when it works.  As some reviewers have said, it takes a while once you get in the car.  I've taken to asking Alexa to tell me a joke to see if she's working yet.  If she does, well, we're good to go.  If not, I pull over, open the Alexa app, tap the blue ring, and for some stupid reason beyond my comprehension, she connects.  I can't explain it.  It seems to be improving with time.Set up was a nightmare.  I have a Bluetooth enabled car, but for some reason it wanted to use the AUX cable.  I didn't care at that point.  I just wanted it to work.  After many, many, many restarts and attempts, I finally got it to work, only to disconnect after a few seconds.  Then the sound didn't work.  Then, for about a week, I had to manually connect it when I got in the car.  Then....suddenly she connected magically every time I got in.  Don't ask me how.  I didn't change anything.  I'm using an iPhone 11, a 2012 Chevy Sonic LTZ, and the Echo Auto.  Technically, it should all work.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"I wanted this when it first came out but no ""invitation.""  Just saw the ad and bought it.  The instructions don't apply too well to my somewhat ""automatic"" MB ML400 sound/nav system.  I had no problem connected the Alexa device with my phone, but it took a few tries to pair it to the car.  Once paired, however, Alexa works reasonably well.  She does use my car's speaker system, but her music doesn't sound as good as the car's music.  It's worth it, though, to have her non-music functions. Much better sound than trying to use the Alexa app on my phone. And I can just shut her off if I want the car's music.  Wasn't sure she'd be there when I restarted the car, but she was.  Wasn't sure the nav system would work with her attached, but it does.  The only problem I've had, after one day with her along for the ride, is the Jeopardy skill.  It can't process my answers. Consistently tells me I'm wrong then gives me the same answer I just gave it.  Alexa does work with my calendar, shopping list, and reminders and can tell me about traffic and commute time.  She probably can find gas stations and other businesses.  And when I'm driving alone, it's just fun to have someone to talk to who at least attempts conversation.  I haven't tried the social convos. That should be fun.  I have her connected through my car's USB port.  She seemed to work also when plugged into the cigarette lighter, although at that point, I didn't have the car's radio tuned to the right place to pair.  I don't have Alexa attached to my car's vent. Do not want to break a vent. The USB port is inside the center console, so I have her in there with the lid open.  I think it's a great device.  And nice that they included a button to turn off her eaves dropping feature.  I have an older car with no hands-free capability.  If she can call people or drop in, she'd be great for that.  Good job. Thanks to the Amazon workers who made this device.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I was pumped for this, stalled on installing because I just had a feeling it was going to be tough, because #beta. Straight talk: it was WAY harder than I thought. It just hit 50 glitches along the way, I had to restart the set up over and OVER and OVER because it wouldn't find the device, then would but wouldn't do the sound check, then would but would lock up, etc. Then bluetooth dropped off and I had to repair my phone all together, it felt like a never ending cycle. Then, the sound wasn't pairing and it ALLLLLLL finally aligned and worked (just keep restarting the setup and the device, that's really the answer), I almost cried happy tears....but then it wouldn't do anything. It would respond and then just immediately beep and shut down without even letting me speak to it. I turned up the volume on everything, extended the talk time (in the settings), updated the Alexa app, reinstalled/restarted everything and BOOM, it was the magic combo. CRAZY THING IS: it's pretty darn GREAT, DARE I say SO GREAT (once it's actually working!) that it was actually worth all of that madness! Playing whatever I want, anytime....checking my calendar/adding/changing it on the go has been FAB....making lists while I drive, playing books on Audible & listening to podcasts, playing my playlists and fav pandora stations, etc. It's just DIFFERENT in the car than when at home in SUCH a great way because (at least for me), the car is where you are in GO mode, thinking through schedules and lists and to dos, kid stuff/work stuff and such while you drive so to have Alexa right there for you the whole time!? Game changer!! Crazy enough, it was worth the setup headache because I finally GOT IT and I LOVE IT! (ps you have to have your phone connected to bluetooth the whole time ((unless you use the aux cable)) and you have to have the Alexa app up and running the whole time so moral of the story, keep your phone on the charger in your car or else:  battery dead!)",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I generally use this to change music on my phone in the car, and it is helpful with getting GPS going.  It works well for that, I haven't had any issues where it can't hear me even with music going.  It's so great to be able to change music completely hands free.  My Yukon has voice control, but it doesn't work as well and just ends up causing more frustration than it's worth.I've also seen people mention that their phone's google/siri can do everything that the Echo Auto can do, which is true, but for my phone at least I would have to unlock the screen or open it before it would do some commands like GPS.

But, the sound quality is awful.  My previous bluetooth adapter had crisp and clear sound with no distortion.  Not this thing.  At moderate volume, there is a ton of audio distortion.

"I finally received my invitation after about a 1.5 year wait. I think it's important to note the types of vehicles I use them in, as I have 2 of these Echo Autos and know some will function differently based on vehicle types and options packages. I have one im my Infiniti QX80, and another in my Q70. Both vehicles have Bluetooth, so no conversion is needed. I was super excited, though knew from the start I would have some hurdles to overcome. However, I'll start with the basic functions of the Echo Auto:1. Ease of use: This operates identically to your home Echo, Dot, or Tap. You start with the wake up word, and ask your question or give your command. Alexa will feedback to let you know you were (or weren't) understood, and execute your command as appropriate. I have no problem with the integration, and have really enjoyed using it to play music, check the weather, or make phone calls.",4,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"First, after reading a lot of reviews, it's obvious there's a lot of people that are not basic tech savvy.  There's no place to begin because there are issues all over the map in those reviews.The common 2 connections are you phone/device connection to your vehicle, typically via bluetooth, but can be direct connection in vehicles that have that, or older vehicles that have 3rd party connectivity.  That's me, I have an '04 Ford Excursion and I added a 3rd party bluetooth connection device which is wired to my sound system.  My phone just connects to that via bluetooth rather than plugging it in as it was for years.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"This was exactly what I needed for my car which has limited voice activation/recognition features.  The many microphones pick up your voice commands no matter how loud you have the music playing.  You can ask Alexa for help with anything while you are driving.  If someone calls you on hands free and makes an appointment, after your call you can tell Alexa to add it to your calendar.  I also receive my reminders while I am driving and I frequently use it to find out store hours since some retail locations are closed altogether because of COVID.  It's compact and mounted easily and quickly on my air vent in my Toyota Prius. It works perfectly with my Garmin NAV device ( though i play music and take phone calls through my cars own hands free and radio).  My only wish is that Alexa would offer more choices in voices; (I'd like my Alexa to sound like the Hal 9000 Computer from ""2001"" A Space Odyssey""), but wouldn't it be great if Alexa had different voices and personalities such as the depressed robot from ""Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy"" or the Bender Robot from ""Futurama"", or even Rosie from the Jetsons, or the ""Lost in Space"" B-9 Robot  ""Danger Will Robinson!"".  Alexa could stay way ahead of the crowd if you could adjust her personality and voice, and have more options to her name.  Instead of ""Alexa:, I would like my own Alexa units to respond to the name ""Hal"".  But so far you only have about 4 options for how you address Alexa.  And the Echo could come in Corresponding Devices that matched a users chosen personality; The interface to the Hal 9000 computer, The B-9 robot from ""Lost in Space"", Bender from ""Futurama"", ""Rosie"" from the Jetsons, etc. There should be far more options for personalities, the sound of Alexa's voice, What name Alexa responds to, and the look of the Amazon Echo units.

"Well, After all the hype, you could just hook up the one from your house in your car and you’ll get the same product. When I got the echo auto, I expected something more. It’s pretty simple to set up. It is exactly like the home echos. Operationally, it pretty simple, “Ask Alexa”.I was thrilled about using it, but was disappointed when it only worked by using a car charger to power it. The charger’s cord is cumbersome as well as not having the ability to place it on the sun visor. It would be great if it was wireless. The separate holder that it attaches to, was also a poor design. It only fit on my air vent which blocked my air. I ended up not using it and the echo auto now sits in my cup holder. The other issue is that it only works when you have it connected to your cell phone. It use bluetooth connectivity from your phone. So if you leave your car and take your phone, it won’t work for passengers left waiting in your vehicle. I’m going to now wait till it gets improved. I’m unsure if it works with your vehicle’s Internet access directly. I like the size and the simple design. I suggest to wait to buy one after some modifications. Especially, if you don’t like cords hanging everywhere. I suggest Amazon needs to consider changing its design to use rechargeable batteries, this way you don’t have to have it plugged in all the time just to use it. The sound come through your car speakers and it’s great to play Amazon music. It’s okay, but for the price, Id wait. One more thing, there is no touch screen, so why is it asked on the review??

I found that if you have a smart phone and the car system has BT streaming, the EA would be somewhat redundant.  What made me give up is that I have SiriusXM on my car and apparently to use the EA to work with Sirius, I have to purchase a smart phone subscription for Sirius.  This essentially adds the ability to control Sirius via voice command inside the car.  This plus the fact that I have to find a location for the device somewhere in/on the dash and wire it up for power, etc. made me take a pass.I would assume other people with different requirements can make it work better than I could and would be more satisfied.",2,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0

I spent the greater part of a Sunday afternoon trying to get it to work, but it would not answer. I'd say ""Alexa"" and it would recognize it was called but immediately shut off so I was not able to get any commands in.

I was sooooooooooo frustrated and I am pretty sure the tech support dudes were as well.  We just couldn't get her to connect.  I swore I hated her and would never use her again.

But as others have said, this thing can cause road rage when you think it's supposed to be  working while you're driving...and it's not working.So...fast forward.  I get a new phone a couple weeks ago, same brand, Samsung,  but updated Galaxy S10E model.  I've spend a couple hours at least, over a few days, and I cannot get the Auto Echo to connect to my car.  I can Bluetooth my amazon music to my car radio directly just fine, easy peasy,  but I absolutely cannot get the echo to connect.",2,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I love this little gadget.  Like many, I had some ""growing pains"" with it when I got it, but unlike many I tried working with it instead of hating it because it didn't work as seamlessly as my beloved house Echos.  I have an aux. input in my 2011  car, so I use it.  Sound is fantastic.  Response time is great.  It behaves exactly like an indoor Echo when asked to perform tasks, answer questions, set timers or reminders, add to lists, play games, play music, etc.  I had difficulty with it losing connection to my phone, often when a call comes in it will do this, I'm sure it's a setting somewhere I may need to adjust, very probably because my car has aux. audio input but bluetooth for phone, so the Echo and my car's phone feature seem to fight. I have found if I unplug it from the power source when I get a call, then plug it back in when the call is finished, it ""finds"" my phone again with no trouble.  That's really my biggest - ONLY, actually - real complaint against this fun and functional little gadget, and that's a pretty easy workaround to basically have a personal assistant who plays music, games, keeps me organized and on the right path to my destination, and reads me books on long trips.  I think the tradeoff of an ""unplug-plug in"" is more than well worth the price.  And again, there's probably a workaround the ""dueling bluetooth"" issue, but my workaround is quite satisfactory.  Only thing I would ask Amazon to add is perhaps a light when Alexa IS completely ready to go?  I live in an area of spotty phone/internet reception.  Goes with the territory, I'm used to and expecting it.  But when I'm not sure, I do wish it would have an indicator that it's available or not so I don't have to ask out loud and hear nothing to know I'm not in range at the moment.  That would maybe be helpful?  Otherwise, I'm really really happy with yet another Alexa in my life, and am very pleased with the price I paid.  Nothing's perfect, but this is more than close enough to be very useful and enjoyable.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I recently had to ""upgrade"" to a used mini van for family life, causing me to sell my smaller car that had integrated bluetooth. I tried 5 different adapters in varying price ranges to get bluetooth to work as I wanted it to in the van until I finally decided to give the Alexa Auto a go. I can say for the price it is absolutely the best option for this purpose. Every other adapter I tried had issues reconnecting with my phone upon starting my vehicle. They almost all had batteries that concerned me with a hot car in the summer, and varying other little problems that were frustrating. The only problem with the Alexa Auto is placement. It is a little bigger than other adapters and because it has all those mics that you want to be able to hear you clearly you kind of want it to be front-and-center (instead of being hidden from prying eyes). Aside from that, usability wise it has been great! Leaving my car stereo is Aux mode all the time feels effortless, because with Alexa I can do navigation, play radio stations (through Radio.com or iHeartRadio) by voice, any music I want from Amazon or Apple Music, podcasts, etc. Phone calls sound just as good as any modern built in vehicle bluetooth as long as you have the unit placed where it can hear you clearly. Being able to voice dial people from my iPhone's contacts is wonderful. The only issue I can say is sometimes when my phone has a wonky connection to my wifi while still in my driveway it causes me to not be able to do things with Alexa until I take off driving out of wifi range completely.",4,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"The grain of salt here for anyone reading is that I really enjoy my ""Smart"" products (Amazon's in particular). Additionally, I have a car with zero features aside from my Aux input. The Echo Auto is absolutely an improvement from what I had before (which is basically nothing). At the very least, it works very well as a bluetooth receiver. Meaning, even if you do not like the Alexa interface, you can still initiate all of the playlists, podcasts, etc from your phone and never have to say a thing.A few criticisms:",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I will say one positive thing about this product that some people have not figured out.  You do not have to dash mount this for it to work.  I took off the magnet piece and used sticky tape to mount the magnet to the outside of my center console and used the USB plug in my center console and the whole thing was tucked away nicely and could hear my speech without any problem. If you have this as an option, its the nicest way to hide it.And now for the bad.",1,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"I do have an older car, and that probably is partly why I like this devise so much.  First, I don't understand why people are having trouble connecting.  This was one of the easiest things I've ever set up- it took me all of 30 seconds.  I use bluetooth to connect to my radio, but Alexa just connected to my phone via bluetooth,  and suddenly it was working through my speakers.  If you see the devise is blue in response to your commands and you aren't getting sound, make sure your radio is on and switched to aux or bluetooth, or whatever.What I like about it- you truly have hand free driving.  I can access Amazon Music, Sirius Xm, Apple Podcasts, literally everything available on my Alexa at home (or my phone), through this auto alexa, and all hands free.  This is especially good for Sirius/XM, so I can switch channels by voice.  That's an improvement for a service that has so many channels.  You do have hands free calling as well, although most have said the audio on calls isn't perfect.  I suspect that is true for most hand free calling however.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"I've had an Echo Auto in my car (a 2015 Nissan Sentra) for a few months now and it's painfully obvious that this is a first-generation product. First of all, for some reason Echo Auto refuses to connect to the network properly when I'm near my house, so I have to wait until I'm a few streets away before it'll respond to any commands. There's a similar blackout area later in my daily commute where Echo Auto will continue playing any media that's already running but won't accept any new commands. And before you ask, this has nothing to do with my iPhone's network connectivity, which has no problems whatsoever doing anything that *isn't* related to Echo Auto in those areas—it's this device and this device only that's flaky.In addition, the main reason I wanted this device is so that I could call up my daily news report with Flash Briefing while I drive to work. I get Flash Briefing reports from CNN, NPR, BBC, and Fox, but for whatever reason CNN ""isn't available right now"" about 90% of the time I try to access it from Echo Auto. The other news outlets have no problems, and CNN has no problem when I access it from a normal Echo Dot—but it refuses to play nicely with Echo Auto.",2,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"This generally works well for streaming music (the primary task I use it for).  I was using a 3rd party product that brought Alexa on the road and was glad to replace it when the Echo Auto finally started shipping.  I used it heavily in the beginning because my satellite radio receiver died, so being able to stream SiriusXM through the Echo Auto was awesome.  There are two problems that occur frequently, most likely related to the fact that my 12-volt plug in the car is always-on and my factory stereo doesn't have bluetooth so I use the Aux cord.  The first happens with each of the bluetooth audio devices I have tried in the vehicle, I'll be on a phone call with my airpods and then the Echo Auto will switch/take over the call while I am in the house.  When this happens I notice because the line goes quiet and I'll see on the phone that the audio has switched.  I can switch it back but it disruptive, especially since I use my phone a lot for business.  The workaround is to unplug from the 12-volt (aka cigarette lighter) whenever I get home.  I usually forget, so when my call is interupped I run out and unplug it.  The second problem is that whenever I leave the bluetooth range of the device and return, for example when I run in to a store and come back out, I get an error message that the Echo Auto can't connect to my iPhone.  Unplugging and plugging back in sometimes fixes this, often I need to also force-close the app.  Sometime both of these items several times and it is not uncommon to be more than a mile down the road before I can get the Echo Auto connected to my phone and functional.  Comparing the two devices, the Amazon Echo Auto works better than the 3rd party device I used but only marginally.  At least it is cheaper.  I suspect if my 12-volt plug turned off with the key AND the radio was bluetooth, it might work pretty good.  I use it 90% for music, 5% for tuning on light and music when I get home, and 5% for random questions when I am driving.",4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Why use this product? Mainly because you can leave your smartphone in your purse, backpack, briefcase, etc. and use the multiple mics on Alexa Auto to pick up your voice to interact with the Alexa App. The mics on Echo Auto work better than my smartphone when my smartphone is in it's cradle on my dash.  In my experience, this has been hit and miss because yor car's entertainment center (""radio"") will not connect to the Echo Auto reliably. It's pretty reliable if you get your phone out and open the Alexa app (put the Alexa app the foreground) before you put away your smartphone. But, if the Alexa's app is in the background on your smartphone it will connect to the Do Auto VERY unreliability. A real PIA. Directions are a real disappointment. If you ask Echo Auto, for directions I hoped it would provide audio directions...turn left at the light, stay on this road for the next 15 miles, things like that. Nope. It makes you take out your phone to get directions like normal. Non advantages the. Also, and this is a pet peeve off mine, there are Amazon sponsored ads during brakes in shows on Evho Auto. I get it, ads are part of life. But these AMAZON ads use the wake with word """"ALEXA!"" which does the Echo Auto dead in it's tracks. Come on Amazon, stop that! With improved connectivity and enhanced functionality, this will be a great device. Right now, it's just ok. Sometimes really frustrating. Having said that, I'm glad I have it and look forward to Amazon improving the product through software updates.",3,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"I was an early adopter of this Echo and got on the invite only list. I was super excited to try it out as I have 6 Echos at home, 2 Shows, 2 Dots and 2 Echo 3s. I love them all so I thought I would love this too but I was left only with frustration and disappointment. I wanted to return it after the first 2 weeks but figured I should use it longer to give it a fair review. It's been about 6 months now so here it goes. I did not experience the connection problems that others were having but my audio lags or chops up, fine, whatever, the issue could be with my car's bluetooth and I can still understand her. Main problem was she couldnt understand me. I don't have a pronounced accent of any kind and I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to repeat myself to my Echos back home. I dont know if it is a different voice software or what but this Alexa is dumber and slower than a drunk Koala. She either misinterprets my requests, gives me useless answers or downright doesn't understand me and ""sorry, I didn't get that"".  The vent mount does not hold it in place at all and the slightest movement or jerk in the car will send Alexa flying and usually landing in an inconvenient spot WHILE you're driving, super safe. I'm hoping Amazon will step it up with a Gen 2 of this product and I gave it 2 stars because it is really convenient when it works but it has a long way to go before I can recommend it. As of now she sits in my glovebox collecting dust because I'm way past the return period.",2,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"Echo Auto is a great tool in the car as it is easy to ask for a weather report.  The Echo Auto also works great with Amazon Music and other streaming services such as Tunein.  Unfortunately, it is not reliable as to connecting, through Bluetooth, with my cars speakers.  Sometimes it works immediately while other times I have to play with the Bluetooth connectivity settings in my car, a 2014 Honda Accord.  I have tried various options such as plugging my iPhone SE into the recharger before turning on the car, resetting the Bluetooth settings once the car is on, etc.  Eventually, I can get Echo Auto to work if I play with the settings in a parking lot.  I suspect that the car's Bluetooth system and Echo Auto have some connection problems.  I expect newer cars to do better.Another challenge is that Echo Auto does not directly provide directs while driving.  I have to stop the car and set up Waze or Google Maps without regard to Echo Auto.  Echo Auto does help me find places of interest, by giving me the distance and address but not providing directions until I stop somewhere and manually set up Waze.",3,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

"I waited so long to receive this and was disappointed. Installed in 2018 Subaru Outback using Apple iPhone XS Max. The Subaru system which has its own disappointing voice system used with my phone doesn’t work well so I chose this as an option. I also have apple CarPlay baked into my Harmon Kardon head unit. I wanted this to work more seamlessly with my Spotify account, contacts and Sirus XM, as well as managing text messages better. It sadly failed at it all, Alexa was consistently offline, unable to use my phones data to answer simple questions about the weather or even where the nearest gas station is which always sent me miles and miles away. Pairing would occur once the car started but then the Alexa would consistently go into a loop of unending loop backs of confusion trying to connect or answer that’s if it even responded to the cue of waking up. I would restart the Alexa app and that would only make more problems, and when everything seemed to work fine it then would quickly loose that especially when turning the car off. I would go to the grocery store, then when returning to the car it wouldn’t pair I would open the app and need to confirm that I was a passenger as I sat in the parking lot waiting to connect. I don’t have time to deal with that every single time when I go on errands. Overall there needs to be substantial improvements in firmware and software updates to even consider using this again. Sad when my homes Alexa devices work so well. I think amazon has great innovations but they fail to connect and make a device that meets the real world needs of those intended to use it.",2,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

"My user experience was a little iffy the first few weeks, but it seems Amazon has worked hard to get this product ready for primetime. I'm glad I waited a while to review it. As of the past several weeks, it connects instantly, and if bluetooth is set as the default audio on my car stereo, it even picks up where I left off with what I was listening to on Amazon Music during my previous trip. Every once in a while it will say it's lost connection with the Alexa App on my device. When this happens, I simply open the app, scroll to Echo Auto and open it up, and suddenly it begins working. I'm hoping that will happen less and less as time goes on.I do a lot of driving for my work, and it's really nice being able to use my voice to control what I'm listening to, and I'm happy it integrates well with Google Maps, pausing the music briefly for Google Maps to chime in with pertinent driving instructions to get me where I need to be.",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

The only issue I’ve noticed is sometimes when playing games such as Jeopardy or Song Quiz it misses my answers even if they are correct.  However, I have also ran into this problem occasionally with my indoor Echos so I think it’s more of a global Amazon issue than just being isolated to the Echo Auto.

"We actually have 2 Alexa for Autos. One for the 2011 Honda Pilot that has aftermarket Bluetooth phone -that one is plugged into the auxiliary port. The other is connected to my 2017 Chrysler 300 through CarPlay. Both work great, although there is a learning curve  that I need to remember to plug the charger cable into my iPhone or the Alexa doesn’t connect to the car!  But after that, it’s great!  I can turn my home lights on and off using Alexa for auto as I pull up the drive. I also have a Smart Things hub connected to my Schlage Smart Lock, so I can have my front door unlocked without having to fumble for key by simply asking Alexa for Auto to unlock the door. You need the hub if you intend to have Alexa ( Echo, dot or auto) lock and unlock the door remotely. You don’t need the hub if you will manually open the door by just pressing the keypad. I would mention that in the Honda, the auxiliary mode must be selected on the car but you can ask for podcasts, SiriusXM, and your playlists that are on your phone. On the 300, Alexa works on any display screen. So I can be listening to a podcast and ask Alexa a question and get the answer. Alexa for auto goes through your phone, so if there’s a dead zone for your phone, Alexa will not work until you get service again. I admit having it is a bit over the top, but it’s handy. I use both Siri and Alexa for different functions, so for me, it makes a basic no frills Honda more modern and a newer 300 more up to date without having to buy a new car!",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I am a huge lover of the whole Echo line and I have pretty much all of the products in my house but I'm a little disappointed in the Auto.  1) if you are listening to the radio, Alexa hears you, but I can't hear her because she is responding via the ""media"" system in my car.  In other words, she won't interrupt the radio and come through the speakers.  Instead, I have to manually switch the car audio system from radio to ""media"" the way I would if I was streaming through my phone.  It doesn't automatically happen, which is annoying.  2)  When I am using my phone to control the streaming, Alexa doesn't like it.  Example, if I want to continue an audio book that i was listening to via my phone, and then I get into the car and continue to listen to the book using my phone as the controlling device for the streaming, and then I ask Alexa for something, she will pause my audio book and respond, but when she's done assisting me, my audio book doesn't continue to play.  I have to go back to my phone to control the audio book (or the music or whatever).  So what I think the main problem is, that the Alexa system needs a software improvement that will allow Alexa to take control of the audio system, and then release control of the audio system, if the user wants to control through the phone.  I gave it 3 stars, because I think the potential for the Auto is fantastic, and I am hopeful that there will be updates that will help with these problems.",3,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0

One minor glitch during set up, but that might have been my car's bluetooth as much as the device's. Setup was painless other than that, and the device worked really well.The one thing I did not like was that the device would cut its sound during Google Maps announcements. That ordinarily isn't a big problem, but this device allows the content to continue while it's silenced, so we would miss a sentence or two of the content.

"This is a device that could be an app. It's an extra bridge and an unnecessary bluetooth connection to get Alexa to work in your car. It would be far more simple to just have an option within the Alexa app for an ""Alexa Auto"" mode where she listens like a regular alexa device. It would also be easier just to bring a echo dot into your car and plug it right into your head unit and then use the hot spot function on your phone. This device in short is not needed and it's repetitive. The only reason I don't chuck it in the garbage is because it plays my amazon unlimited music almost perfectly when it does connect which is about 65% of the time. Otherwise its useless. You can't reach the buttons on it if you position it on my dashboard in ANY of my vehicles. I warned Amazon that this was a device that needed a use. They didn't listen and here it is.**UPDATE** Revised to ONE STAR but I would give it ZERO stars if possible. Amazon actually called me regarding my review because they were concerned with my connectivity issues. I told them how to fix this issue with a very simple software patch that would fix the same issue with thousands of people who are apparently having the same issue. They apparently didn't think my advice valuable after they paid someone to get it so the problem persists. Actually it's gotten worse. Now, with that being said, this is product is dangerous. I say that because it's EXTRAORDINARILY BUGGY given it's mainstream distribution. If this was a toy or a baby seat the FDA would have recalled it because it is DANGEROUS. The device asks you to unlock your phone or you have to touch your phone to check whether it got your destination correct when using it for navigation (which it usually gets wrong.) This makes you have to pull over or try to make you make the adjustments while driving which is not only ILLEGAL in many states but could put you unnecessarily in a life threatening situation.",1,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"Revised...Following the review below Amazon contacted me with instructions on how to force an update to new software.  Once Alexa's software was updated it used the phone's Bluetooth connection and speaker to talk.and this was perfect.  At most I only had to lower the car's radio volume so Alexa would hear me and I could hear it.  What I really wanted to do was use Alexa Auto in my camper and now was able to do so.  The app picked up my location so weather reports were on spot and all other responses were as you'd expect from Alexa.  I did notice some latency going through the phon'e cellular connection but again, that can be expected. There was also some latency in Alexa connecting to the phone which seemed to be helped by opening the Alexa app.  I do miss the audio quality of my bigger Alexas as compared to the phone's speaker.

"There are things I like, and some major disappointments with my Alexa Auto.  I have a non-bluetooth enabled car (I use the AUX cable for Alexa) and live in a hands-free state, so I had really high hopes. Connectivity to my speaker is great - I can play Spotify and use Apple/Google Maps for directions and calls, but the Alexa function is AWFUL.  Since install, it hasn’t once been able to successfully connect to my phone.  I've gotten use to using Siri for making calls or directions and so I continue to do that (or manually do it before driving) and the speaker system works as advertised .... just don't count on ""Alexa, call Mom"" to work while you’re driving (...which is kind of the point, right?) And then there are the cords! I understand cords are needed to function, but it's a MESS.  I've placed Alexa on the second row vent (using the vent stand) so that all of the wires are tucked behind my console and out of the way. The speaker still works fine when I’m talking on the phone, but designers should have spent a little more time on this aspect.Side note (if you’re paranoid about privacy) Alexa always needs access to your location to be able to give directions or use any ""smart"" programs (like routines).",2,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I have two of these. Both bought at the invitation price. One is in the car. And it works as advertised. I had zero issues hooking it up with the car and my phone. I'm not sure where others have had issues and why they thought it was hard. It hears you with the windows down and music blaring. Both of mine came with the dash mount, but I'm not using either. (Using a double stick foam tape from 3m, which i also recommend).Now, the second one isn't in a car. As this goes off my phone's data, I thought maybe it could work with any other speaker system. I don't have wifi at work, so and Alexa wouldn't work there...until now. I have it plugged in to a 3.5mm aux jack on a shelf speaker system. It works great. Automatically connects to my phone whenever I come and go from the office. This is what the failed Echo Tap needed in to be able to do successful, since it had to be connected to wifi each time (even using a hot spot on your phone).",4,1,2019-10-3,1,2,0

"We’ve been on the Alexa bandwagon since the original Echos were released. When we signed up last year to be notified when the Echo Auto would be released I was ecstatic. At the time Amazon Music and Alexa wasn’t as integrated as it is now and it was annoying to try and use the Amazon Music app via my Bluetooth. I relied upon Sirius XM or Pandora while driving. Amazon Music has since become extremely awesome and Alexa was introduced to the app, so long as the app is open you can talk to her like you normally do.Fast forward to last month when we were able to purchase the Echo Auto early. I’m thinking this is great, no more making sure my app is open when I need to change songs, playlists, or stations. It worked great....... for the first day only. Every time I have attempted to use it since then the device connects to my phone, which connects to my Bluetooth in my Jeep but it constantly tells me there is a connection error or I’ll try and talk to her and she immediately stops listening. My husband has reconnected the device three time, same thing each time. It works great for the first day and then the next day it doesn’t reconnect. It’s now in a drawer in my office. Apparently if you can set it up via the enclosed aux cord and not Bluetooth it works much better but that defies the point of it being Bluetooth.",3,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"Honestly this is the most useful amazon echo device I own. I don't use the ones in my house terribly much - but in the car, a handsfree option is MUCH more useful, and much safer.I love the echo auto. I got it early via invite last year. I have a 2009 Pontiac, and I've never had problems with connectivity. My car doesn't have bluetooth, doesn't have any kind of voice on its own, so alexa is plugged into the jack and she's my only voice control. I LOVE that I now have my phone's audio on the speakers, which yes I can also do by just plugging my phone in, but now I just slide into the car with my phone in my purse and it's connected to alexa automatically without me doing anything. No hassle, no even digging my phone out of my pocket.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

"I have several Echo products through my house and I really wanted to like Echo Auto as much as I like the others but I’m not there yet. My biggest point of contention is the integration. Echo Auto relies on your phone for its data connection, which makes sense. However, I expected Echo Auto to have a direct bluetooth connection to my car’s radio but that is not the case. It ONLY connects to the phone over Bluetooth. Then, the phone connects to the radio sort of like a middle man. This results in more of an Echo Mobile than an Echo Auto. Why do I care about this? Because with multiple drivers, the phone pairing between both Echo Auto and the car’s radio isn’t seamless and often requires some manual connections to make it work. This results in me using Echo Auto less than I might otherwise use it since I don’t always feel like going through the hassle of making sure it is connected properly.That said, once it is connected, it works pretty well. The sound quality is quite good and the Echo functionality is similar to what you would get with any other Echo product.",3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"20200413 -- I've had this in the car several months now. I really thought I would use it more. I have carplay, so mostly I use Siri. It turns out that Alexa is handy for talking to the rest of the gadgets in the house, but in the car, I'm usually interested in getting information.Unfortunately, Alexa is pretty much useless for getting any information that isn't the most cursory level of detail. To be fair, Siri isn't a lot better, but in the car, to be useful, Alexa has to be completely hands-free, and a lot smarter.",2,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"I've got the Echo Auto in my 2018 Honda Fit EX, which is already outfitted for in-dash Android Auto (which I use) and Apple Car Play (which my wife rarely uses). Either usually fits the needs for everything, however, Android Auto and Amazon Music Unlimited don't really play well together. That lead me to the grand idea of adding an Echo Auto to my car.As far as the features go, there's nothing really to complain about, since they work as expected for any Alexa-enabled device. However, while running in the car, it does jeopardize the car's screen, so using it for directions, not so friendly. Also having built-in SiriusXM means either turning off the bluetooth to get it from the satellite, but also enabling things like channel art, or utilize it via the LTE/Bluetooth connection, and having a crippled feature set, even with the added internet only channels.",3,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"I have a love hate relationship with this item. At first it was mostly love. I love the convenience of voice control for my music in the car. The only issue at first was in the truck Alexa has a hard time hearing us on the highway so we have to speak too loud for the sleeping kids in the back seat. In my car there was no issue with the voice control. I'm assuming that had to do with the placement of the item and the noise around us. Then I started to realize she doesn't have much knowledge... When I ask for an address... She just doesn't have a clue. So the navigation idea is not good. When I used my GPS through my phone she does quiet down the music when the phone wants to talk. So that's a plus.***** MOST IMPORTANTLY the biggest issue now is that the app is CONSTANTLY losing connection. I'm not sure how many months I've been using the echo auto, but the past couple of weeks the app isn't working. I know it isn't my phone, because my phone shows it is connected to alexa, but she can't connect to the app. She says to open the app to reconnect, but that doesn't nothing. I have to unplug her, restart my phone, and plug her back in to refresh everything. SUCH A PAIN!! Sometimes it isn't even worth it. And the worst part is it only happens in the afternoon. When i leave for work she has no problem connecting. But when I try to go home, after a long day, and i just want music, I have to listen to the radio because she won't connect. I don't love her anymore. She is more of a bad distraction than a good device. Maybe the app needs an update, or maybe it was updated and Alexa just doesn't work with it anymore, I'm not sure, but I do know I don't recommend this anymore.",2,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"It seems to be a bit random whether Echo Auto will work or not on any given trip.  At least I can't figure out what's changed when it stops working, and it typically starts working again on a subsequent trip, without any intervention.  (When it doesn't work, Alexa just responds with a beep, whatever I say.)  However, when it works, which is probably 80% of the time, it's very nice. Even before Echo Auto I had at least two ways to talk to (or ""through"") my car -- I could ask Siri, and the car's entertainment/navigation system itself comes with some kind of voice control capability.  I have to admit that I hardly ever used either one, except occasionally to make phone calls.  The whole family is used to talking to Alexa at home, though, so it's been easy to adapt to talking to her in the car as well.  I find that asking for even slightly obscure music etc. is an exercise in frustration (whether in the car or at home, but the car might be a somewhat more challenging environment for speech recognition to begin with) but, since everything's happening in the cloud, there's some hope that it might get better in the future.  In any case, I try not to get annoyed when Alexa fails for the fifth time to understand what I'm asking for - I remind myself that *I am commanding a computer assistant -- that I bought for $25! -- to do things for me from the comfort of my driver's seat while driving down the highway at 65 miles an hour and she is actually understanding me at least some of the time"" to avoid EIAANIHS (Everything Is Amazing And Nobody Is Happy Syndrome, pace Louis CK).[Yes, I understand that this $25 widget is basically just a bluetooth microphone, and it's my phone, which cost more than $25, and, really, the cloud servers, which cost someone, but not e, *a lot more* than $25, that are doing the heavy lifting, but it's still pretty amazing.]",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"This is a bluetooth microphone that listens for the Alexa wake word, and directs everything to the Echo app on your phone.  There is no actual intelligence nor app-installing ability in this device.There is an audio out port, but it only works if the Echo Auto has no bluetooth connection, which the only thing it can do is tell you there is no bluetooth connection.",2,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"I had been curious about this fairly recent addition to the Echo line of products and was happy to receive Echo Auto as a Christmas present.  My grandson and I set it up initially and that process was relatively trouble-free.  However, later I was in my car to run an errand and the previously working Echo Auto was no longer working.  I tried to restore it but nothing I did worked.  So I googled the problem and there was the solution near the top of the list (power down the device and restart the Alexa app).  Since I performed that fix it has worked flawlessly.  One of the things I immediately liked was that I could ask for a podcast to play and quickly I was listening to it...no searching for it, just request it from Alexa.  Music was the same experience, the difference in the car being that I didn't have to search for an XM channel on my car radio for a type of music.  BTW the sound quality through my car audio system is awesome!  Of course being able to control lights, thermostats, etc in the house was a welcome add to my in-car experience.  I am preparing for an extended road trip and I will be trying out the voice-initiated navigation app which appears to be so easy to use based on a limited trial I did here in town.  The Echo Auto voice recognition has worked beyond my expectation.  I have just laid the device in a tray in my car (USB attached, of course) and voice recognition has worked flawlessly...so I didn't need to mount the device with the air vent mount.  Overall, a very positive experience!",4,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"When it works, it only halfway does what you want and it's very frustrating. But it doesn't always work and it's inconsistent. It stopped functioning so I tried saying ""Alexa reboot"" which worked. The next time it broke down I said the same thing and nothing. So I said ""Alexa restart"" and that worked. Stopped working again and neither of those worked so I had to unplug it to restart it instead.Tried to send a text message to a friend and it could not recognize the name and told me it had no contact information for a completely different name.",3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Overall, highly recommended. You have to do what needs to be done BEFORE you turn on the ignition: open Alexa on your smartphone, turn on your car speaker, plug in Alexa to power, plug in your smartphone to your car's speakers. After that you can use your music streaming service, audio book service, news service, or play a game. You can ask questions as you would of Google. Installation took me about 10 minutes. Bluetooth was seamless. The only problem I  have had is that after I make a call without Alexa (using the keypad on the phone), I need to reconnect with the EchoAuto. I am enjoying this device because by interacting with Alexa, long drives are less boring and I can interact with my music streaming and audio book services. Sound quality gets 3 stars UNLESS you connect to your car's speakers, in which case it's a 5 star experience. Voice recognition is terrific. I don't use Echo that often at home, but having one in the car is quickly becoming indispensable.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"I was excited to try this because it is so handy to have Alexa do your bidding while you are driving. Most of the time it works really well, but I have a few problems with it. Set up was problematic. I have a 2016 Mazda CX5 with the Infotainment system. Following the provided instructions the Echo Auto didn't immediately work upon hook up. Via troubleshooting I found I had to manually switch the sound source from FM radio to my phone so that Alexa could come out of the car speakers. Once I figured this out she works well. But be warned...if you the source to listen to your radio or XM or another phone, you have to manually select the bluetooth connection to your phone to get back to the Echo. It's not really very safe to do the switching if you are driving.Also, you have to pause your command to the Echo Auto. At home you just say, ""Alexa...."" but with this car model you have to pause after saying ""Alexa"" until you hear a tone that lets you know she is listening and ready to hear the rest of your command. Takes a while to get used to.",3,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

"I've been eagerly awaiting this device since I first heard of it and it was invite only. I'll start by talking about the actual device. It's small, lightweight and fairly attractive. It has a multicolored bar led at the bottom to act as the ring on most alexa devices. Only 2 buttons, one to activate it instead of the wake word, and one to mute it ( to stop your kids from messing with it from the backseat!).The mount attaches to a vent in a way that I haven't seen before. It creates a much more solid mount than I am used to, but apparently is incompatible with some vents. There is documentation showing the types of vents it works with, it worked fine for mine (2016 Lexus RX350).",3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"I have Alexa control much of my house so I was very happy to receive this device. I installed it in my 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe that has Sirius and Android connectivity. I was excited to show it to other people, but it constantly disappointed me. This device never worked properly. I called customer support and they recommended a few things I should do to improve performance, but it just won't maintain internet connection, which it constantly drops. When it does connect it works perfectly, but that's more NOT than often. I live in a suburban Florida community, so maybe that's the problem, or maybe it's my T-Mobile network, which I usually don't have a problem with. I'm thinking it may be my Android Auto app, which I'm not willing to give up because I use it's nav constantly. Regardless, I do not recommend this product until it's improved. I've regretfully given it up.UPDATE Nov 23rd: I was almost immediately contacted by Amazon customer service regarding this review. They say that the problem is not with the Echo device (although indirectly, it is). It appears that Echo Auto is completely dependent on my phone to operate correctly, which I knew, and since I presently have a Samsung J7 they are not compatible. So now I need to decide if I want to upgrade to a more expensive phone to get this to work. At this time, I'm keeping the 1-star rating",1,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"The only reason I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1 is if you own an older vehicle that has no interface with your smartphone. In that case, the phone calls work fine and if you want to listen to amazon music.However, if you own a newer vehicle that already interfaces with your smartphone, this device has very little use. The phone calling and receiving works fine, but your newer vehicle already does that. Text messaging is another story. After installing I sent a text. Person didn'g get it. Text to myself, didn'nt get it. Then disovered the message was received in my alexa app. Called amazon and they text messaging only works from one Alexa user to another Alexa user. So don't plan on using this for normal texting. Even worse whey you receive an ""alexa"" message from another Alexa user it does speak to you telling you have a message. It doesn't even beep. I asked amazon tech how I know I got a message. He said tiny light bar on this tiny device will turn green as opposed to blue. Green and blue on this tiny device hard to distinguish.

There's nothing better than getting close to home and telling your car to open the garage and turn on the lights. Not to mention driving directions, whatever music you want and make calls  all hands free.  This is basically just a voice controller for your cell phone ( and uses your cell data, so don't bother if you don't have unlimited data!)My stereo has bluetooth and aux so connecting was all of 10 mins and super simple!

"I was excited to get one of the Echo Auto devices and it was pretty easy to setup in my Leaf. After the initial configuration, I was able to use it to ask for directions and play music, which was neat, but I also have the G-assistant built in to my phone and car via the Android Auto, which could already do everything I wanted. The only upside would be if this included Amazon Music Unlimited or something that I didn't already have available. The thing about new technology is that there should be a use case for it that fills a need (perhaps one that consumers didn't even know that they had), but this falls a little short in that department. I have several other Echo devices around my house and like the home automation aspects of what Amazon is able to do there, but nothing in my car that feels like a new piece of functionality. I also have some connection issues from time to time that basically ruin the experience. On occasion, the Echo Auto will just stop responding or say that it has no connectivity, but the app on my phone works without issue. I find that I (at least semi regularly) have to unplug power to the Echo Auto and then restore power to get it to work properly again. I'm sure that this could or might be fixed with a firmware update or future release, but again there are so few reasons to use it over the app that I can't in good faith recommend it to someone else. On top of that, the lack of a good cable management system means that I often have one or both cables for the device blocking my car's main display screen from the need to use the vent holder located directly above the screen. I'm an early adopter of a lot of new technology and didn't have any real expectations for this device, so I can't really say that I am disappointed, but I am also not really thrilled with it either. Of course with anything, YMMV. Best of luck!",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0

Your phone bluetooths to your car and Alexa is synced to your phone. You can do all your alexa skills -music, games, questions etc. If you use your phone apps simultaneously e.g. google maps or calls, alexa will automatically pause and resume music while these apps interrupt the audio seamlessly. I can use other voice activated apps on my phone while alexa auto is connected.I have to say the obvious perk is for 2nd and 3rd row passengers (friends, family, uber riders) being able to also control the music and participate in games.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"This product was released to the public before all the bugs have been worked out. The unit hardly ever connects to your vehicle or cellphone and constantly asks you to open the application on your cellphone to allow it to connect. This doesn't solve the connection problems most of the time either. A very good idea but it appears that the product was pushed out the door without being refined. Numerous friends have the same issues and have returned or asked for a replacement unit to have the same issue. If you care to read further ill tell you why i'm giving it such a harsh review.The first Echo Auto that arrived did not connect nor did it work from day one. I contacted Amazon support, they had me do a factory reset which made the unit completely dead. They also requested that I set my phone setting to two different setting in hope of correcting the errors. Neither worked. Amazon sent me a replacement unit. The second or replacement unit must have been a return or a open box unit as the cords were just mushed into the box and were not neatly wound as new products come. The replacement unit works occasionally when it feels like it. When you give Alexa the wake command she constantly says,""sorry, Im having problems connecting to your mobile device"", then asks you to open the Alexa application on your cellphone to connect. This defeats the purpose of just not using the Android Auto Connect application that came with my vehicle. I constantly have to open the Alexa application or restart my cellphone to have the device connect. It is ridiculous to think you have to do this every time you restart your vehicle. Customer support is aware of the issue  ( check other reviews or google the connection issue ) and has received numerous complaints of the same nature .I was told that hopefully a future update will correct and resolve the connectivity issue. So with that said, my vehicle is brand new and is not the problem. It connects to EVERYTHING else I paired it with. Bottom line is that if the unit had cost over $30 dollars I would have taken the time to repackage it up and send it back for a refund. I would not recommend this item until they do a software update or correct the connectivity issues. I have numerous other Echo items and absolutely love them, but this one is a complete flop. Good luck if you decide to try it for yourself.",1,1,2020-2-12,1,1,0
"I have 6 echo dots in my home that I absolutely love, so I thought I'd give the auto a try. The setup was simple and straight forward. The connectivity is about what I'd expect, because my cell phone service isn't always the best. The sound comes clearly through my car speakers via bluetooth. My 2 issues are...1. I dislike the airvent mount. It's awkward stringing the power cord from the air vent to the power port. It manages to come loose and fall off at least once a week. Since the bottom is magnetic, I'd much prefer some sort of magnetic mount that I could stick on my dash or closer to the power port.

"MECHANICALLY IT WORKS WELL BUT HOW WELL IT FUNCTIONS DEPENDS FIRST, ON YOUR SMARTPHONE, SECOND, ON YOUR VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY UPON ALEXA.

"**Update: Amazon customer service reached out to me within a day of posting my review, to discuss the issues I mentioned.  It is obvious that the software development team is listening to people's concerns and working to make the product better.

Sometimes disconnects from the Alexa app (most likely due to phone's battery saver, so I can't blame the Echo for this). Sometimes doesn't respond at all until you unplug it and plug it back in, even when pushing the Alexa button. Often will correctly interpret something (get directions, for example) but then nothing happens. Can't skip songs without cell service. Can't skip songs if you start playing music manually (on the phone rather than using Alexa, I was told this wouldn't be an issue if you start music (i.e. Spotify) from the Alexa app). Sometimes will say ""sorry, I can't do that right now"" repeatedly when trying to skip a song. Had to do a factory reset to pair with new phone.

I was one of the customers that got to try it before releasing. It’s a good idea but it’s not there yet.1. Set-up: if your car does not have Bluetooth capabilities then you are stuck with 2 cables. At first it was fine but then realize cables get tangle and at weight to the magnet and it falls off. Then setting up with the app was easily until the device wasn’t found. It took 30 minutes and turn off and on the device until it finally was pair to the phone.,1,1,2019-10-6,1,1,0

"Response to Hollister - The biggest issue is Amazon sometimes calls this an echo and some times an auto accessory. Once I understood this set up was EASY. Add the device as an echo then auto echo.  Obviously to be so small it needs a power cord which I prefer over a battery I have to change or recharge. My car does not have bluetooth so I bought a simple aux bluetooth receiver from Walmart. Paired it with my phone and voila, no audio cord needed. I also went to the dollar store and bought some 2 sided sticky velcro to mount on my dashboard so it's not in the way of my air vent.  Tucked the power cord in and now I've tested voice navigation, phone calls, audible books, music, my shopping list, Alexa games like Jepardy etc. all without hiccup. I now have Alexa in my car.

"I love Echo devices. I have 5 in different parts of the house, and I bought two more for my parents for their house.

Even if I stutter, the thing still usually knows what I meant.I have no trouble getting Echo Auto to connect to phone and car. The hardware is tiny and easy to mount. My problem with this device is that it's got cruddy voice recognition. It does alright with engine noise, but its generally flummoxed by the sounds of my climate control system (AC/heat). It also struggles to hear me if music is playing, even pretty quietly. This, combined with the generally less-effective voice controls, means I spend a lot of time screaming at the thing to shut up, then reaching for fan and volume controls, trying to make her stop playing a song I never asked for, have never heard of, and don't like.",2,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"I wanted to like this so much. I use Echos in our house frequently, adding items to the shopping list, asking for the weather, setting alarms, turning on/off lights. I also use Siri a lot on my phone and laptop to add items to the calendar, get directions, etc. I hoped to have the same level of handiness in the car, as I use Siri a lot, but I'd love to be able, for instance, to add groceries to the shopping list as I think of them while driving, or tell Alexa to play a particular song from my Amazon music library.When I hooked it up, the process of getting started was uncomplicated.

"I have the original echo tower and several later generations in different rooms. My elderly mother has one. My husband jokes that he moved down one ranking of wherehe is in my favorite people list after she first arrived. I use her every  day for many useful tasks (weather, news, traffic, intercom with kids in other rooms) and also fun tasks, as do my other family members. I was delighted to get the Alexa auto invitation and especially at such a great price. All that said, I was so disappointed that I had to send her back due to such slow, unreliable performance and poor design. For $24.99, I should have been telling everyone I know how great she was, as I do with the echo and dot. Instead she was an annoyance and a failure for us. Total shame.",2,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"I received my Echo Auto through an invite Amazon sent out during its initial release.  I have Bluetooth phone calls in my car but it's not able to play music through Bluetooth.  The Echo Auto seemed like a promising way to finally be able to have both.  Getting everything connected and turned on was relatively easy.  I had wires everywhere (to power and aux port) but was able to get them cleaned up with zip ties to make it somewhat presentable.  At first, music and ""Alexa"" commands worked great.  During phone calls I could hear the person on the other end fine but everyone told me it sounded like I was in a tin can and there was way too much road noise (I drive a Malibu, a fairly quiet vehicle).  I settled by making phone calls through my car's Bluetooth and playing music through the Echo although it did require manually switching things when I wanted to go from one to the other, not ideal.  After a couple weeks I started having connection issues.  I called into Amazon and they walked me through factory resetting it several times before it finally started working properly again.  Not long after I got it fixed the same connectivity issues popped back up and that on top of having to switch back and forth from car to Echo depending on if I was making phone calls or playing music was was enough to make me finally disconnect it from my fine and unplug it from the outlet.  It was a great idea and still sits on my dash in case I ever decide to give it another try but for now I'll just be listening to the radio and using Google Assistant on my phone for any voice commands.",1,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
Voice recognition - I never had an issue with speaking to the echo while driving and music on. Alexa was always able to understand my query or command.Sound Quality - This will only be as good as the sound system already installed in your vehicle. The echo integrates with a standard 3.5mm headphone cable to an Aux port on your radio.,3,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I love this! Very easy to install and setup. I did not use the provided vent mount, though I did use it initially. I decided to mount my unit upside down with double sided tape to a center console I have above the rearview mirror and I think it works better in that position because the microphones work better without ac blowing across it. Not sure why Amazon went with a vent type of mount because I believe the air blowing across it affects the microphones. Alexa's voice response is lower than the music volume and I find myself turning the volume up to hear what she's saying. That's the only CON I have. IMO the voice volume should not be lower than the volume I'm playing Amazon music at. Possibly another CON is there is a slight delay, longer than I would like, when you say Alexa and the system responds with a ""ding"" for you to speak. Definitely recommend this. Love it despite the CONS. Hopefully Amazon reads this and it can possibly be tweaked a little via a firmware or software update.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,1,0

"Received a few weeks ago. I have an aftermarket Pioneer deck in my car which connects to my iPhone 7 Plus via bluetooth.Set up  was quick and simple. Connection to the phone was fairly simple once I downloaded the Alexa app. By default, the device uses Amazon Music for playing music in your car but you can switch it to Apple Music in the app preferences. It can then control your music via voice.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I love the idea this and really wanted it to work. I've had it for months and it often won't connect my phone, skills rarely work, occasionally interferes with my phone connection, and sometimes just won't work at all. I have a 2016 RAV4 which is too old for apple car play and I'd hoped this would fill the gap by providing additional voice integration but it's just not ready for prime time, at least not in a rural area.UPDATE: I've updated this from one to 3 stars solely because of the excellent customer service after my first review. We did some troubleshooting and while we can't find a suitable answer, at least they tried. I think this is a product that would be amazing for older cars without bluetooth. Newer cars may fight for priority between your car's installed bluetooth options.",3,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"So at first I was so disappointed with this product, I was ready to just throw it in the trash. But since the latest iPhone update, it seems to be working much better. I had all kinds of connection issues at first: the device would not be recognized by the app, which caused me to have to de-authorize it through my account twice, remove it from bluetooth, etc. etc. After upgrading my phone to iOs13, I finally gave it one more shot. It finally connected and has now worked flawlessly. You have to leave the app open all the time, but the issue with that is it drains your phone battery too quickly. So now I just shut the app down each time I leave the vehicle and fire it back up when I get in and want to use the device. It works pretty good now. I can control my lights and Nest from inside the vehicle, I can stream my music, and  the sound quality is very good. Only reason I gave it four stars is you can't stream music on this device while someone at home is streaming music. If they can fix that issue and allow streaming across multiple devices in the same account, it would be ideal. But I am glad it appears to be working better now than it was initially. Oh, and one other thing. Every time you get in your car and it fires up, you need to verify you’re a passenger in the vehicle through the app in order for the device to work—what a pain. I get that they need some kind of disclaimer in there so they aren’t held liable for any accidents, but come on. This is a hands free device, which is the same thing as your Bluetooth phone- and you don’t need to be a passenger in the car in order to make phone calls! This is redundant and a bit ridiculous.",3,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0

"Now I know why my insurance company gave me this for free.  It is not worth the money Amazon charges.  It is not a useful tool in the car, but just a distraction.  First of all, it is useless for navigation because it can not access addresses in my contacts.  So, I can't ask it to take me to someone's house.  I checked with my Echo at home and saw that it has phone nrs and email addresses, but no street addresses.  I never knew this before because I don't try to navigate my home anywhere.  Secondly, at home I can use Alexa to play music from several services I subscribe to.  Not the Auto one.  It plays crap that is not even close.  It is more of a distraction from my driving duties, than anything else.  I will take it out of the car so it doesn't cause an accident from cussing it out.Well, I decided it was worth another try when I realized I can control things like thermostat and lights from my car, but when I tried using it again, I saw that I have to make a choice of listening to the car radio or to Alexa.  That entails repeatedly changing the source on my stereo from one to the other.  Just another distraction from my driving.",3,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0

"EDIT: I updated my review from 1 star to 4 stars.  Everything I write below is still true about the installation being very buggy, including that the test audio that the app uses is somehow handled differently than all other streaming.  Where I thought the Echo/app wasn't working, it was really just that the test audio refuses to play through the Bluetooth adapter.  But then I tried using the Echo, anyway, and it worked just fine.  So the moral of the story is, if the test audio in the Alexa app doesn't work, maybe the Echo will still work.My car is a 2013 and Bluetooth is reserved for making/receiving calls, but it has iPod integration so I bought a Bluetooth adapter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R2HZ1XU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) so I could connect through that.",4,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"If your looking to give your car a Bluetooth interface this is a reasonable way to do this but probably a little bit pricey compared to other options. My biggest complaints are essentially two problems. 1) Does not buffer or has a very small one. Any drop in connection from your cell phone or its cell service will terminate what your listening to either briefly or all together. This is super annoying. Any of your music service apps will buffer the songs so brief interruptions do not effect your listening experience. The Echo will allow you to play these from your phone through the Echo to your car stereo. 2) Connects to the Internet through BT requiring Alexa app to be running in the background. This also requires you to hit a button to insist you are a passenger in the car if you are trying to do anything with the app while on the road. Probably the worst part of this is that it doesn't always, in fact for me rarely, sync back up to the app correctly rendering it useless unless you muck with it to correct the problem (of course not wise to do while driving.)Prior to buying this I just used one of the puck sized Echos connected through my hotspot. This was a little annoying to set up initially but reliable once completed and its easy to find them on sale for about half the price of the Echo Auto.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"So, my husband got one of these bad girls for himself. He is the ""payer"" for the Amazon accounts, but like, I have my own account under his, so we don't see each other's carts and all but he is the ""main"" person, idk, anywho... I got one for myself, however, I could not use most the Alexa features unless I was logged in to his account on my phone. The device works via the phone, and the phone has to be logged in to the main person's account. If I logged in to his account on the Alexa app, it would log me out of my account on the Amazon app, and into his. This wouldn't be such a bother, however, his parents use his account and CLUTTER up his ""saved for later"" cart, and the payment methods, and addresses, and I cannot handle it. The features I could access on my own Alexa account were more annoying than the radio. I could only play the very most free stations (could not get to his Amazon music either), and I would say like ""Alexa play Chris Stapelton songs"" and she would give me 1 Stapelton song, 2 other songs I did not ask for, and then 4 minutes of commercials. I couldn't ask her to look anything up either. She also sucked at sending texts for me, but that could be the service out here in BFE, she also would lose signal with my phone cause of our address, which was just the last straw. I just had to send her back.",3,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"UPDATE: took away one star, maybe should have taken more, for poor general implementation. I purchased a second unit for my wife. In her case, she uses Sirius built in to her car. Since the Echo Auto requires to be played through Bluetooth audio, she had to take her hands off the wheel and switch the source to Bluetooth. POOR POOR implementation. Amazon engineers should have made it work as though Echo Auto was making an incoming call, because in that case the switch is automatic. Another alternative is to install a separate Bluetooth speaker, but again the engineers failed to make such a switch easy... There is no easy way to turn on Auxilary audio, as is widely reported. And why not just be allowed to use the built in speaker. Failed engineering! But good for those who listen via nothing other than Bluetooth, for which the rest of my review is valid.Here's an excellent device every driver should have. It's not apparent until you install it, how useful it is. I listen to a lot of audio books while driving and sometimes want a word definition, just as Alexa. Need to know traffic conditions to a destination, just ask. Integration with Waze, yes. How about as a learning tool, for when the kids are in the car, Perfect.

"When this thing works, I can't say enough good things about it. I have one in both my cars, a 2015 Explorer Limited and a 2003 Explorer XLT.  They both work well when either connected by blutooth in the newer car or by an auxiliary input and cassette adapter in the older Explorer. Easy to set up, but the main issue is that they seem to randomly lose their connections with the Alexa app, and I have to start all over again to set them up.  I have even had to uninstall, then reinstall the app on my phone several times. Because it seems to happen randomly, and it happens to both of them at the same time, I suspect updates are causing the issue. I'll knock on wood as I am writing this, because I haven't had to reinstall or reconnect for several weeks. If it weren't for these issues, I'd give these little gizmos 10 stars if I could! They do everything as advertised! I love my customized morning flash briefing and playing Jeopardy in the car.  I do have a bit of a beef with the support for these, however. I still have not found out how I can ANSWER an incoming call through Alexa. (not a problem with the new Explorer, which automatically reverts to Sync to handle the calls, but I am at a loss with the older car.

"I was excited to add this to my car so I could have hands free calling, navigation and music. Boy was I very disappointed!!  My car is equipped with some hand free functions but I have to go through Siri on my iPhone and I have to have my phone unlocked and I still need to navigate through my phone. Unfortunately the Alexa Auto needs to be connected to wi-fi or cellular data at all times. That’s fine except when you’re in a dead zone or you are connecting to various hotspots while you’re driving. If there is any disconnect it has to reconnect to your Alexa app and then you have to restart the music you were playing because it doesn’t just resume. Very frustrating!!  I tried turning off my wi-fi and using only my cellular data for more consistency but there are still dead spots causing my music to once again stop. I spent more time trying to reconnect than I did keeping my eyes on the road, which is the point of getting this device in the first place isn’t it?  Further, your apps need to be open to use them as well. Mainly the Alexa APP. I’m done being frustrated so back to just using Amazon Music through my car’s system. And the Music APP has hands free Alexa capability anyway. Way less hassle.

2003 Honda Pilot. Has no auxiliary hookup and of course no Bluetooth however the pilot has a cassette deck.  Using a cassette adapter which has an auxiliary adapter cord built in you can hook it into your Echo Auto and have full functionality. This is where the Echo Auto is at its best. I also have a 2018 Chrysler 300 with navigations and unlimited data Wi-Fi hotspot but using the Echo Auto in that vehicle it's not intuitive and redundant. And it doesn't function correctly at times. Living in Florida they just activated a new law. It is unlawful to use your phone while you drive and instead of having a headset I can use the Echo Auto hands-free in an older vehicle and all the little perks that come with the Echo device.,5,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0
I was really excited to get my Echo Auto!  but disappointment soon arrived.  It was hard to set up. I spent a lot of time sitting in my driveway trying to get Alexa to talk to me.  I followed the directions over and over.  Don't do that - call customer service.  Customer service was helpful and then put an update on it for me that addressed some of the issues I was having setting it up.  Would have been nice if I had received an email telling me to call customer service to get the update before I spent hours working with the thing.I don't particularly like the air vent mount because my Echo Auto periodically falls off in the floor.

"Echo auto has been great to make my vehicle into a hands-free device while I am on the road.  I am able to ask her to play music stations, pod casts, find trivial information, important information, joke of the day, add items to my grocery or to do list, all of the benefits of a typical Echo/Alexa device.  However,  I find the device often has trouble connecting to my phone, or becomes ""disconnected"" from the Alexa app.  The only thing I find that ""fixes"" this, is to unplug it and plug it back in.  I have to do this at least once a day.The other thing I don't like (though not a big deal) is that your streamed music doesn't pick up where it leaves up.  If I am listening to a station and I turn off my car, to run in somewhere real quick, when I come back, I have to ask Alexa to play the station again (and then I've lost the song I was listening to.

"So we are one of those crazy houses that has an Echo in every room and a fully automated smart home, so my review is skewed towards the positive being fortunate to have these devices well integrated in our household, and this does make a difference in how well Echos work and are utilized.  We both drive Teslas, so again, I may have a skewed review of the new Echo Auto due to our cars being very tech current. I have had zero issues with this Echo device, and my kids are obsessed with it. Yes, the vent clip is absurd, clunky, and an embarrassment for the Echo design team, but like others, I’ve found that ditching the vent clip and  just setting the device in my center console cubby works perfectly fine with zero voice recognition issues. I had zero issues setting up this device, but again, Tesla has a very high tech interface on its tablet console, and the vehicle was designed to work seamlessly with an iPhone, so Echo Auto has worked flawlessly for me every time. I don’t leave the device in my vehicle due to extreme temps where I live, and while others have gripes about reconnection issues every time they put it back in their car, I’ve had zero issues and my car recognizes the device via my iPhone right away.

"I was one of those who waited 4 months for their invite to come through.  Footprint wise it is a lot smaller than it appears online.  The device is hit or miss and has random connection problems with popular apps like Spotify.  Lately, when I tell it to ""play xyx on Spotify"", it just doesn't work at all.  Very frustrating.  The only ""fix"" for me is to open Spotify, then it starts playing.  That's dangerous if you're driving!  There should be some way for this to get auto updates; maybe it does, I don't know.  I find that I only use it for navigation, and playing music.  Amazon needs to iron out the kinks and make a 2.0 version like they do with all of their other products.  Number one request that I would have would be to somehow make it power wirelessly.  I guess that would require some type of rechargeable battery, which would add to the price and probably the overall size.  This has potential, but it seems Amazon is not too concerned about making it right.  I do not recommend this product.",3,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
"I thought getting an Alexa Auto would be like having a Dot/Echo for the car.  Turns out it works entirely differently.  From what I can tell the Alexa Auto is a fancy bluetooth-connected controller for your PHONE.  In order for the Auto to work, your phone needs to be on, AND you need to have the Alexa app open on your phone.  This means that you need to check your phone to ensure the app is open before you get going.  If you forgot, you're out of luck (unless you can hand your phone to a passenger to open it for you).  Want to listen to something on Spotify?  You'd better open that app ahead of time, too.Is your phone in a language other than English?  The Auto pulls the language to use from your phone.  As of right now, there's no way to select the language you want to use independently of your phone.  For most, this isn't a problem, however I had my phone in Spanish, which prompted the auto to only respond to Spanish, which really does not work when many bands or song titles' names are in English.  The only way to ""switch"" the Auto to English was to switch my phone language to English.  I should not have to change my phone settings, especially when  other Amazon devices (Dot and Echo) let you pick your language in their setup.",3,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I've been using it for over a year now and there's too many errors.For example, I'll say the name of someone I want it to call and Alexa will acknowledge the request and say it's calling, but it doesn't actually place the call. Happens often.",2,1,2020-9-1,1,2,0

The holder is a joke. The one you see on TV, well, it must be custom made or an additional accessory. The one it comes with clips onto to your vent, and we all know how well those work.The biggest complaint I have is that it uses all my data. I have a limited plan; I just don't use my phone for things that need a lot of data -- why pay for it! But all gadgets from Amazon (and maybe everywhere, I don't know), are always in a scan mode, just waiting for you to say its name. That eats up a lot of time on my plan, about 1.5 GB in a week. My inside Alexas work on my unlimited wifi data. Of course, I could leave it unplugged but then what's the point? It was ""handy"" to play Amazon music but my house ain't that smart so I never used it to adjust temperatures or lights. I guess you have to be like Matthew McConaughey to fully appreciate all its features. For me, a middle class grandma, it just wasn't useful.

"Let me start by saying that I purchased Echo Auto by using Amazon's invitation before selling to the general public.  I use it daily as my total commute time is anywhere from 3 to 4 hours (depending on traffic).  My car has Apple Play so when I connect my Iphone I can use some of the apps on the built in screen.  The first time I tried to connect I had some initial issue trying to find Echo Auto on the Alexa App.  Anyhow after the initial setup, I started using Echo Auto to listen to my music.  Your Echo Auto uses your cell phone's connection to connect to Amazon Music so depending that your cell phone is connected to the internet or not.  I lose connection when I travel through a mountain pass that I generally travel through every single day.  It is not a game changer but it reconnects when it finds a signal once again (through my cell phone).  I feel that the Echo Auto hears my commands at all times even when I have the air conditioner set on high.  Again, I only use Echo Auto for music which was my main interest in acquiring this device.  It works as if I was at home which is what I stated in my feedback to Amazon.  I do not use Echo Auto for directions as I would rather see where I was going on my car's screen instead of listening to verbal directions.  My navigation app instead provides directions for traffic and not the Echo Auto.  I did have some issues of it connecting to my Iphone but it does not happen often.  An example would be that the Echo Auto seems to freeze (for whatever reason), but all I do is disconnect the power usb cable and plug it back into the socket.  You cannot use the usb to plug it directly into the car port (where I plug in my iphone) as it will not work correctly.  It uses your cell phone for its connection and so it is connected via bluetooth (initial setup procedure).I gave the Echo Auto 5 stars, because it works for music and that is all I use it for.  It works great in the car, and it makes easier and safe to get the music you want to listen to. I believe that it works great (even with the occasional hiccup), so I would recommend it to anyone interested in listening to music in their auto.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I was not very impressed with the Echo Auto.  I super excited to get it.  We are 100 percent an Amazon family and have the tablets, firesticks, dots, echo, etc.  I thought this would be a great addition.  Here are the problems I found.  One it has too many wires that get in the way.  Really eats the battery on my phone by using Bluetooth. Offers 8 speakers and find myself either shouting or picking up unit to talk to it for Alexa to  hear me.  Interfers with my GPS / phone.  I used it on a long trip for continuous music but unplugged when I needed to do something else.  Forget trying to connect while driving through Amazon App you MUST pull over to be safe and manage your way through the various connection screens.  It does prompt you not to setup while driving, just letting you know it's not possible and be focused on road.  That part is good but gets annoying if it disconnects which is does from time to time.  I think this has the potential to be amazing but needs some tweaks.  The Echo Auto adapter easily fits in vent and no problem staying, has nice magnetic hold to keep it in place.  As of now I find it too aggravating to use unless I am driving longer distances and I carry back up power source for phone from Bluetooth draining it. Has potential but just not yet in my humble opinion.",2,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"I guess it’s telling (about the product and/or the expectations) when the annoyances are what you find yourself focusing on when writing a review.  So here we go . . . firstly, it really didn’t work at all in the vehicle I intended it for: a 2018 Ford F-150.  That truck already has CarPlay and Siri and Alexa were always fighting and Siri won because she’s built into that car.  Next I tried it in a 2008 Jeep Wrangler with no smart tech in it.  It works okay but (and this could be as much if not more the Jeep’s fault) the sound isn’t great through the auxiliary jack and getting the volume right is elusive.This device also has a very long Bluetooth range so that I can’t walk anywhere near the Jeep when I’m on the phone or it will pickup, with no warning or indication of any kind, and the person I’m on the call with can’t hear me.  Again this isn’t exactly a flaw in the product.",3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"This drained our car's battery and killed it! Don't risk killing your battery... it's not worth it!ETA - After leaving our review, a representative from Amazon contacted us and was nice enough to refund our money (even though it was past the return period), plus give some compensation for our battery due to our experience.  While we still wouldn't be able to trust an Echo Auto in our car, we appreciate Amazon's good customer service.",1,1,2020-3-8,1,2,0
"While I haven’t tried to use everything that echo auto can supposedly do, it does work very well selecting between all audio services. I think the biggest positive is this keeps my phone out of my hands because I no longer have to select what I want to listen to on the road, I just tell Alexa.The biggest pitfall I’ve found, that I also saw someone else mention, is the echo autos ability to connect quickly after the vehicle is started. Sometimes it’s a minute, sometimes it’s 5 minutes but it hasn’t yet completely failed me. I can just chop this up into teaching human beings some delayed gratification.",4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"( Note: I'm not connected to vehicle. I Use Samsung Note 10 + and auxiliary port)I got the Echo Auto a little earlier than release and it is now a must have in all of my family's vehicles. I love being able to play music and get directions on demand just by talking. I'm able to make announcements to the family through Echo system at home. Phone conversations are clear on both ends of calls.  Another bonus for me is that it's completely integrated in to my Echo, Alexa and Samsung SmartThings home Automation systems. I was shocked that it appeared in my SmartThings hub. It also connects to the home wifi quicker than my phone does when I pull in to the driveway so my Smart Home Automations now trigger faster.(lights on, security off, or announcement to the family im home. Quite notification to the family its me coming in the house in the middle of the night)",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"I was one of the people that tried this item, on initial release.  I had off and on difficulty with getting it to connect with my Samsung Galaxy S5.  I switched recently to the Samsung Galaxy S10+, and after numerous attempts, still cannot get the Alexa Auto to connect and operate with the Alexa app on my new phone.  I had applied for another invitation, to get one for usage in my 2nd car.  I did not do this, as I now cannot get the blasted thing to connect to the Alexa app on my phone--period.  It essentially was finicky with my Galaxy S5, and now does not seem to want to work at all with my Galaxy S10+, so basically, for me, it is dead and useless.With the wiring needed for the device, and the issues with keeping connected to the Alexa app, I consider the device to be some what of a pain.  The modern auto, with blue tooth, and the modern smart phone, which has blue tooth, makes the Alexa Auto look antique.  You do not need wires, and you have a multitude of ways to stream music from your phone, to your in car radio.  The market niche for Alexa Auto, is just about none existent, for proven connection capabilities of existing items, like Pandora, or Google Play.  Alexa Auto is unique, only in the capability of voice commands, if you can get it to work, and stay working, for which it currently has serious difficulties.",1,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
Love my Auto Echo.  Easy set up. Can check time & traffic while traveling & Alexia navigates my trip.  Love that it pairs with my Amazon prime music so I can listen to my play lists.Small & easy to pop out and slip into your pocket or purse when leaving your vehicle.,5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"I am a big fan of the Echo Dot. I've got a couple of them and they do a pretty good job of figuring out what I am asking for, most of the time. I got on the list for the Echo Auto as soon as it came out, and was pretty excited by the prospect of being able to access Amazon Music from the car, along with using Alexa to get directions, answer questions, and so on.Sadly, I've been disappointed by the Auto. My experience with it has been frustrating, starting with the first day I turned it on. Pairing with my phone was problematic, although it eventually worked for some reason. (I've seen similar comments from other people, too.) Once that was working, I found that the microphone array doesn't work as well as the Dot, by a long shot. Most of the time, I have to repeat things multiple times, getting louder and louder, to the entertainment of the other people sitting at traffic lights with me. After eventually getting music to play, it is difficult to change or stop the music that's playing. It's quite frustrating to ask for songs by one artist and, instead, get a continuation of the last artist that played. In some cases, you can fix things by fiddling with the phone, but that defeats the purpose of a hands-free device. Overall, it's been a disappointment. Perhaps a future software upgrade will make it more fun to use, but for now I rarely bother with it when I'm driving. The radio doesn't answer questions or give directions, but I can change stations without any problems.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I've had this thing since the 'beta' and as a whole I'm deeply underwhelmed.  It ostensibly has all the features of Alexa in general (so it's not entirely useless) but it's marred by several issues that do make it rather pointless.- The voice recognition in a noisy car often forces you to yell at the device to make it understand a command.  Half the time it still gets it entirely wrong.  It's almost as bad as the ""voice recognition"" in my 2011 car.",2,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I tested the Echo Auto and I have very conflicting feelings about it. I love all the echo devices in my house, and i hope to love echo in my truck. I have found that i can't use it all the time in my car. I have a 2015 Ford F150 Platinum. So my car is not too old. But I am not able to have my Note 9 and Note 10 connected bluetooth to the truck at the same time as the Echo. For some reason the Echo Auto cause our phones to not have any audio sound if they are both connected at the same time At first I thought it was my truck so we tried it in my husband's 2018 Infiniti and got the same results. So I was very disappointed that about this because I use my phone to take hand free calls in the truck when driving. And I use my phone for Google maps when I need directions. Also, when I want to play my music on my phone instead of the Prime Music. So I have to choose which device I want connected. I choose the Note 10 because I am able to still do everything I use to hands free, which I am used to doing. Don't get me wrong I love using the Echo Auto but I hardly ever use the it. I hope they fix this soon because I wanted to have the auto garage door and lights option. And I wanted to use so many other options but until this is fixed I will continue to use my phone.",3,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I’ve had the Alexa Auto in my car (2019 Mazda CX-5) for about 2 or 3 weeks now.I find that since I’m used to talking to Alexa at home, it’s easy to give commands in the car as well. I like that I don’t have to use the touch screen to select my XM Channels, because my car has to be stopped for me to do that. Giving the command as I was driving was much easier.  I also like listening to audio books through it, asking about the weather, and having her play amazon music.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"If so this isn't for you.Dunno about those others but everything about this was/is awesome.  Control do just about anything you can already echo.  Playing ""the magic door"" on road trips is about as much fun as you have a right to have driving for hours. I dunno how long I've had the device now... A year? Almost? I can't remember cars without it.  With the echo being Bluetoothed to the phone and the phone to the car all you need do is grab the power cable to switch cars.  Vent clip works well and doesn't appear to age and weaken.  Um  dunno what else to say.  I was a requester before they were offered to public and I still find it to be the best echo product yet.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
"Lo adquirí por invitación hace dos semanas aproximadamente. Si tienes Echos previamente en la casa encontrarás el uso perfecto. Lo uso como entretenimiento en el carro con los juegos, es ideal para viajes largos con la familia y la función de usarlo para comunicarme con los echos de mi casa es excelente. No lo valoro con 5 estrellas porque le falta la función de cambiar el idioma en el app. Me costó un 50% menos, aunque la espera fue de unos 7 meses.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,3,0
"Once setup, which is easy, this has the best sounding bluetooth on both end, your caller can hear you perfectly and you can hear them perfectly without having to touch your phone at all when you get in the car, this automatically connects and you can ask Alexa to play an artist mix, playlist, radio station, and you can use the Sirius XM app.  So if you don't have satellite radio built in or activated in the car you put Alexa you can still listen.  Want movie times, weather, traffic, news and any other skill just ask.  This has enabled me to drive safer and auto respond to texts incoming texts and it can read you the text messages.  Never take your eye off the road again to fiddle with your phone.  This connects every time and all you need is a smart phone.  I have had this since it's release and this is worth every penny.  I just got the new iPhone 11 Pro Max and I simply deleted my old phone in the app and added my new phone by holding the action button down for 8 seconds to put into pairing mode and the app guides you through the rest.  After that you never need to fiddle with any settings and you can use almost all your Alexa skills.  Excellent mount and cable management tool included.  Couldn't be happier.  If you are a gadget person or know one this is the perfect purchase for yourself or as a gift.  I have one in my new Mercedes too and I use it all the time because it is totally hands free.  The kids can even play games.  5 Stars ++++",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I love the Echo Auto!  I didn't have any expectations, couldn't even think of how it would be useful over my current vehicle Bluetooth.  I had pre-ordered it because Amazon offered me a great deal before they were released.  It took forever to receive it, I didn't get around to using it until recently.  So glad I did!Example:  with the Echo, I can jump into my car and listen to Spotify or other skills, get weather task or calendar or business addresses or numbers,  place phone calls, control my lights and temp at home,  etc. and have it play through my car speakers WITHOUT plugging my phone in.  The Echo connects to my car better to do things than my phone alone.  Which makes no sense.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I love the Echo Auto!  I have an older vehicle and there is no blue tooth available on it, so the Echo Auto basically put Alexa in my vehicle.  It also connected all my phone's capabilities through the stereo, which is awesome.  We went on a trip and I used Waze to navigate while listening to an Audible book and taking hands-free calls all through the stereo, thanks to Echo Auto.  I realize for newer vehicles this is ""old news"", but when you don't have the capability it's great to be able to get it with such an inexpensive purchase.  Plus, Alexa can do so much that it's a pity not to be able to use things like Audible and Amazon Music in the car without having to connect a dying iPhone to the auxiliary jack and have it flying all over the place every time you make a sharp turn!I have read a lot of the negative reviews on it and I do understand most of the points.  I think if you already have blue tooth in your vehicle and all of the other capabilities that comes with, Echo Auto could potentially be more frustration than it's worth, because it has to remain plugged in for power, so there's wires and an air vent mount to contend with.  My car had an auxiliary input plug, only, which is what I had to use.  I have an iPhone and it did have multiple issues connecting to the Auto, initially.  I completely shut down and re-booted my phone and had no more problems - it connected immediately and stayed connected.  My vehicle is also set up with a charger and the auxiliary jack inside the console (2006 Toyota), so I was able to sit my Auto in a little cubby in the console with no wires running across my dash or my air vents, just the two wires going into the console right above the cubby hole.  I have found that when I get in the car and start it up, once Alexa ""chimes"" through the stereo, I generally have to go into the app and press the ""I am a passenger"" button.  After that, she works great.  It's a little inconvenient, but it's something I know needs to be done, and is a quick task I complete before I put my phone away and put the car in drive.  There have also been times when I lost connectivity while driving, but I found these were normally portions of the trip when my cell phone also loses communication (no or low cell service).  She does occasionally lose connectivity at random times, but I can almost always ask her the same question a few seconds later and she will pick right back up.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"I really wanted like this product and I expected it to be useful in my car that doesn't have Bluetooth, but in the end, there were too many quirks to make this a really useful product.It may sound petty, but one of my biggest gripes is that you can't use any of the standard Echo wake up words except Alexa. My son's best friend's name is Alexa and it makes things very confusing. I have five other Echo products in my house and they all use the word Echo to wake up. I found it very annoying to use Alexa in the car but Echo everywhere else. Also annoying to explain to my 5 year old son that it was the same AI, just had to use a different name.",2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I enjoy this product generally and when it works, it is nice. As others have said, though, every once in a while it resets or something and won't connect to my phone, my bluetooth stereo or both. Getting that resolved is always a hassle as I have to try a raft of different things to get it to work again. Of course, the time I discover that there is a problem is when I am getting in the car to go somewhere, and since it doesn't get connected instantly when it does work, I will have already starting driving before I get the news that it cannot connect. If I was hoping it would get me directions somewhere it is extra frustrating. I could use my phone with the Alexa app and connect to the stereo with Bluetooth, but there is much less you can do that way, so I thought it was a good find at the initial price. As long as it maintains it's connected status, I really do like it. I don't know if the problem is software, hardware, firmware, whateverware, but I hope it is something that gets resolved. It happens just infrequently enough that I don't remember how I fixed it the time before. This last time I unplugged the Auto and replugged it, restarted my phone and had to ""forget"" the Auto on the Alexa app and then re-pair with it. All the messing around took quite a while but in essence, that seems to be what it takes to make sure you have covered all the bases.",4,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
"I have an Echo product in every room of my house.  I really like them and have purchased several for gift giving.  With that said, I found Echo for the auto to be a disappointment.  It’s difficult to connect. With a good iPhone, Apple CarPlay and Audi connect, the Echo doesn’t provide anything that I don’t currently have access to.

"I'll start by saying both my home and office are wired with Alexa and I'm a big fan. I was so excited to get my invite for the auto one and have used it for several months. And I WANT to love it. But......it's the most frustrating, barely working, hit or miss electronic device I've ever wanted to toss out a window at 65 mph. You have to connect it all the time. Every time you get in the car (open app, wait FOREVER, finally connects), if you turn the car off, if you breathe in the wrong direction.......Which I would totally deal with if it then worked. And 50% of the time, it does. I get weather, my flash briefing, any songs I want (I also have music unlimited). The other half the time, I cannot even fathom what it is doing. It gives me random playlists that aren't mine. It doesn't respond at all. It keeps saying connection lost. Ask it to shuffle....it gives you a whole new playlist of songs you've never heard of, never asked for, and don't want to listen to. Tell it to stop.....nope, it doesn't know stop today. You have to stop it via the app. It's an exercise in frustration, so if you have other alternatives through your car's own system or an app - DEFINITELY do that over this. I'm hoping someday it gets better, but I'll probably have run over mine long before that happens.",2,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"Works just like at home...EXCEPT the end of ALL Alexa's responses cut off before she finishes her sentences.  So guess what? If you ask her a question, her answer gets cut off at the very end. If she is giving you a reminder, the reminder is cut off at the very end so you may not know what the reminder is about. If you ask her to do simple math, you're not going to hear what the answer is. Apparently this is something that they have known about since beta testing and they've still not fixed it. It's very annoying and it's not helpful when you need answers from her. Don't buy this until they get it fixed. I wished I'd done my research and knew about this. I would have waited until they fixed this issue. I will be happy to edit my review when they fix this. REVIEW EDIT: 03/05/2020... so the most amazing thing happened, about a few hours after I left my original review, Mitch from Amazon called.  He worked with me over a period of 2 days, accommodating my schedule, and the issue is now resolved. I have a Samsung S7 Android phone. It's system was not fully updated.  As soon as I was updated to Android 8.0, tada!  Alexa now speaks in complete sentences and properly finishes all of her thoughts, stories, and responses.  I really love having Alexa Auto in my car. My vehicle's system does have certain hands-free capabilities, but not able to send voice to text as I am driving, and it certainly doesn't interact with me the way Alexa does.  However, Alexa can send voice to text! Yesterday she sent a voice to text, then I had her go right back to reading the book I'm listening to.  If I get bored with that I then have her stream in the latest episodes of the Dave Ramsey Show. For after school pick up I listen to music from our playlists.  I love that I can ask her for the forecasts in the morning as I'm driving, or have her tell me what time it is, or if I'm bored at a red light I have her tell me one of her cute little stories... and all these things done without having to take my eyes off the road.  I can now drive off happily into the sunset while Alexa tells me everything she knows about sunsets. Thank you so much Mitch from Amazon tech support!  Mitch is the best Amazon support in the whole entire universe and world!",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0

"I picked up the Echo Auto for a vehicle that doesn't have bluetooth.  I've had other bluetooth devices in the car before and I have to say, this is hands-down the best I've had.  Easy to setup, hassle free & excellent call quality.  The vent mount didn't work well but the sticky pad it came with is fantastic.  If you don't already have bluetooth in your car (or the mic isn't the best) I highly recommend Echo Auto for that reason alone.The Echo software though... it's not well designed for in-car use.  It was originally designed for a stand-alone device on a WiFi connection and it shows.  Answering the phone or making calls are fine.  Playing music or books is OK but, as near as I can tell, it will always stream the data, even if you have it downloaded to your phone.  It also won't understand any commands (even stop/pause) if it doesn't have a network connection.  Asking for directions or anything else is an exercise in frustration.  It will find crazy locations, it won't launch an app to display a map... the list goes on. Fortunately, OK Google and Hey, Siri both work fine through the microphone on this.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"My 2012 Equinox didn't quite have all the Smartphone features that I wanted like hands-free song selections. I tried another device that linked my phone to the 1/8"" Audio Jack of my car, it was never completely hands-free. I gave the Echo Auto a try and loved it at 1st. I instantly overcame my frustration with the endless repetition of songs heard on my car radio with anything I felt like listening to. Now I simply could say ""Alexa: Play Machine Gun by Jimi Hendrix on Spotify"" AND it would play immediately. Here comes my reason for giving it 4 stars. Alexa stopped working seamlessly with Spotify. It would work with Pandora and other Alexa features like Weather etc but not Spotify. This was totally frustrating because I saw MANY others having the same problem. I saw many suggestions like relinking my account and none of them worked - argggh! BUT I finally figured it out!!! It's a Spotify problem. At home my Spotify links to my Wifi and uses that for a preferred connection. When I leave the house and drive away, Spotify still tries to use my Wifi connection. Alexa would acknowledge the song I asked for but nothing would play. Here's the fix! Before leaving the house I turn OFF my Wifi on my phone. Before starting Alexa, I go down the road about 1/2 mile which allows things to wake up and get connected. After that, everything works even without a delay! I'd give the Echo Auto 5 stars, if there was better support and fixes for anything that may come up but overall I'm very happy with it.",4,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"I love this and use it constantly in my car. I have the latest iPhone and a car with all the integration bells and whistles, but I don’t use anything but Alexa. I move between iPhone and Android every couple years and have settled on Amazon Music as my preferred music service. I consume Audible books and Alexa reading Kindle as well. I like my podcasts from Stitcher. Before Alexa Auto, I constantly found myself driving down the road with thousands of dollars of bells and whistles, but I couldn’t get my car or my phone to play what I wanted to hear without picking up my phone. Now, I can use anything with an Alexa skill, which is pretty much everything. I can play Jeopardy on my way to work. I get Alexa to read me the news and weather. I can make a list while I’m on the way. There is just so much more I can do with Alexa than I can with Siri or Google play given I don’t want to uproot my entire life just to switch phones.One thing I can imagine some people having a problem with is that this has to be connected to a powered usb. I happen to have the perfect little spot in my console with a usb in it, so no cables are exposed in my car. I could not deal with that. If you don’t have a spot like I do, it could get messy.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"I have been using this device for a while now. Getting it set up I had no issues like so many that I have read about.  Overall, it works fine.  Hears my voice and recognizes what I am saying regardless of car noise or even my daughter having a meltdown in the back seat.  I have never had an issue with command response.  I like that I have 2 mounting options.  One rubber mounting pad with adhesive and a vent mount.  The adhesive has been solid for 4 months now but Illinois is not known for sunny warm winter months so we will see come summertime.  The cord doesn't bother me because I have a usb port on my front dash so it keeps the cord out of the way.  I would be frustrated if my only power option was a center console.  I have had no connection issues after starting my car.  It connects perfect every time.  Most of the issues I have regarding blue tooth or connectivity are the fault of Mazda.  Overall I am very happy with it.  A few issues that do irritate me A LOT.  1. I'm not sure if this is phone related or Alexa app related, but if I turn my car off, say Alexa Stop or any other means of interrupting the song it will start over from the beginning as soon as Alexa powers back on.  I can turn my car off in the middle of a song, come back a few hours later, start my car and the song just automatically starts playing again from the beginning.  After a few hours I tend to forget that I might have had the volume up and there is nothing like getting blasted by an unexpected song while sitting in the quiet after starting my car.  Auto play needs to go away or allow me to disable it Fully.  My iphone auto play could be disabled but it never failed that in my car it would always play so it must be part of the Alexa app.  2. Direction integrations are terrible.  Hands free means free from using hands...I shouldn't have to do anything with the Alexa app.  Driving along and I say Alexa get me directions to Whatever...She says getting directions but they are never displayed on my phone because the app doesn't auto wake my phone. So I thought maybe she will just give me turn by turn voice guidance....nope nothing.  So I have to grab my phone unlock it, open the Alexa app, tell the app I am a passenger and then ask for direction again.  Alexa says again...getting directions, opens maps and then I am greeted with the ""It looks like you're not navigating right now"" response and nothing happens.  I am just looking at a map.  I ask again for directions, she says getting directions and nothing loads on the map.  I can go to the Alexa app and go to my list of recent input and then select it from there.  Or I can just ask my phone for directions and its done.  If either of these can be corrected on my end I would like that information.",3,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

"After a few months of use I decided that I’d had enough of Alexa Auto and removed it from my car. Here is what I found during my trial test:Pros: Alexa auto is very convenient for a hands free device for the car. Having all the power of Alexa you can ask for directions, play a specific song, turn on any smart plug in the house, set/disarm integrated alarm systems ( I have Ring ) and much more with just your verbal commands. Alexa Auto will pair via AUX and car lighter socket or Bluetooth. I unfortunately do not have Bluetooth so I opted for the first option so I did have some unsightly wires in the car. There are I believe at least 4 microphones, possibly more, so picking up your voice commands over the sound or wind or air conditioning usually isn’t a problem. The unit is small and looks pretty cool, the stand (sold separate) is magnetized so holding it in place is usually a sure thing. Getting directions was always as easy as, “Alexa, get directions to..”. My phone would then get a notification from Alexa to open and there you go, directions to your requested destination.",3,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I ran into an issue with the echo car and wrote a review that I am am taking off. I stated that it did not display the lights and smaller than advertise.

She is very knowledgeable and very patient and helpful. She is one person that knows her product along with Smartphones. She listen and walked me through all the steps.

About the Size, The commercial with Tom Brady in his truck asking Alexa echo car things was very large in size on the dasboard. But this is the not the size you will get, they must used a prototype or resized image for their ads. Therefore, the size is small and can be mounted several ways, Air Vent, but this one did not really work for my 2001 Chevy Suburban.

"In my car, if I use my phone for navigation (Google Maps), to make or answer a phone call, or use any other voice-search enabled app on the phone, the Bluetooth API integration for my radio will SUPERIMPOSE the phone's voice responses OVER my radio selection.  The radio volume is automatically dimmed and I am able to hear my phone's responses and interact using the built-in mics in my car.  My phone is a standard iPhone with the current version of IOS.  The car's phone integration is 'smart' enough to know how to properly interact directly.However for Alexa Auto, I must first manually change my audio system setting to disengage my AM/FM/XM radio and select 'Phone Music'.  In fact, the instructions specifically say that this manual switch away from on-air radio must be made.  This should not be needed.  The phone is already smart enough that when it's time to send audio to the car, it uses the embedded APIs to provide the interaction.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"This has to be the most annoying thing I have used in a long time. Since I have an iPhone I find Siri to be a A LOT more user friendly and I don’t know why, but once I connect the Echo—I lose Siri! Just can’t use both. But if you ask Alexa for directions, to make a call, or anything else you’re met with silence-instructions to enable a skill or add contacts! So, there is no integration between your iPhone and Echo. The other thing I find annoying is the delay between waking the device and the chime to let you know you can ask Alexa what you want. On a recent trip I found it took 3-5 seconds for the device to wake up. That’s annoying. Often times it doesn’t even understand what you said. I thought it was due to background noise so I moved the vent mount lower and closer to me——didn’t help. I’ve also found this Echo drops connections easily. I thought MAYBE I lost cell service but that doesn’t seem to be right. It’s so annoying to be listening to something then have it go away and you have to start over. During a few trips I got so frustrated I unplugged it and used Siri: which is why I am considering returning it and getting my money back. The only rationale for not doing that is the price I paid as an introductory offer. For $25 I can probably live with it but I know if I had paid full price I would have already returned it.",1,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Amazon Echo Auto is certainly a first generation product, including limited startup information that, if included, could have kept installation frustration to a lesser level.First undisclosed need to know: the volume level is so suprisingly low that you cannot recognize a successful bluetooth handshake and operation.  The fix is to tell Echo to set volume to 8 or above,  then turn your auto sound system to a similarly high level.  This actually changes your phone's media volume level to 80% or higher.  End result, everything that worked audibly well before may now be painfully loud and possibly damaging to your sound system!",2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like this, but it looks like it's going to end up in my junk drawer of early adopter purchases that didn't work out. I've had the same connection issues as others have reported. You can't listen to the radio and have it on Aux at the same time to hear Alexa. I can't for the life of me find a consistent way to get navigation to work. Sometimes I can use the Auto to start Spotify but not stop it. I've found that my phone stays connected to the Auto even after turning my vehicle off (I guess the cigarette lighter socket stays hot), so if I forget to unplug it (which is finicky) I will answer calls on my phone but can't hear them talking because audio is going to the Auto in the garage. I've also started having a strange behaviour where a kid will ask Alexa somewhere else in the house to play music and instead it will start playing on my phone... During calls I'm on for work. After apologizing to clients about Fortnite themesongs and princess soundtracks multiple times I'm about to lose my mind. I don't know for sure it's Auto related, but it started doing it right after setting up the device and I've had lots of other Echo devises before with no problem. This is the first one that's so closely linked to my phone so it's certainly suspicious. (And if anyone else has experienced this and has a solution, if love to hear it.) Two stars for a neat idea, but there are too many problems to recommend it to others.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"I've had this device via my husband's account, since it was the one that got the invitation, for a while... Must say that looking at some pictures people just complicate the installation... First off, it has 6 microphones that can hear you from almost anywhere so no need to install it on your dash,I have it next to the cupholder so all cables are nicely hidden and she can still listen to me very well... You NEED data unlimited if you want to use this because EVERYTHING it does is via internet and Keep in mind that just like your phone will loose connection or signal while driving same will happen to device.. In my case I have a Samsung S10+ which allows for multiple Bluetooth connections so I just need the phone connected to the car and this device can run through the phone connection without needing the aux cable. Most of the times it doesn't provide me with the correct addresses that I speak to it but google assistant and my fingers still get me through just fine. If you don't have a vehicle with android or IOS auto, it's a solution for totally going hands free, still glitchy and it's being worked on just like the first echos so just be patient....

"I have been using the Echo Auto for about 3 months and it is all that! First, the Echo Auto is easy to set up with Bluetooth and your connected smart phone (check the list for compatibility, I’ve used Samsung Galaxy S8 and 10). You plug it in, pair it to your phone through the Alexa app (add a device), and turn your Bluetooth audio on. It has not missed any commands unlike some of the older Echos. I am on the phone a lot in my car and Alexa has made it easy to book appointments to my calendar without touching anything or looking away from the road. I can listen to my Audible books, and on the way home I can have the temperature changed in my house, exterior lights turned on, lights in the house changed to a color to suit my mood, etc. “She” makes calls for me, gives me directions when my navigation is a little outdated, tells me the forecast, plays my favorite playlists, and a plethora of activities that are important to have hands-free when you are driving. I honestly have not found any negatives. At first I wasn’t sure if I needed Alexa in my car but it has definitely made my travels more safe, more fun, and more productive. I know that I haven’t even skimmed the surface as to things the Echo Auto will do hands-free for me. In the future I hope the Echo Auto will be able to respond to contact’s text messaging outside of Alexa to Alexa messaging. That and maybe feed my pets when I’m gone.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I love this device as my vehicles doesn't have bluetooth.  We got it through the invitation from my husband account as I kept submitting under mine and could never get one.  It uses your phone and the installed alexa app.  Music sounds much better on this device than my previous version of using my phone with an aux cord. I've learned to always open my alexa app first thing when I get in the car.  If I don't, she will keep saying that ""I've lost connection to the app"" and won't work.  This device is also great for handsfree calling.  Ill tell her the number or person and she'll call.  She'll also answer and hangup upon command. I haven't don't much with gps, but she's still the same alexa when it comes to weather and questions.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,1,0

"It appears as if many reviews are already capturing the problems with this device, but I am going to keep my list as succinct and to the point as possible.1. Connecting to this via Bluetooth worked great for me when I first followed the steps, but each time I left the car and came back it wouldn't connect again... until of course I was not even in my car and somehow it would connect to my car in the garage.",1,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"SO I put in for the invite. I got the product. I had connection problems right off the start but realized I needed to uninstall and reinstall my alexa app on my iphone. After that, the paring process went quite well.  Now it connects to my phone every time I apply power to it.  I can command my lights at home as I drive up. I can ask it any questions I can ask my Alexa devices at home. It intterupts the phone's current playing media to answer or respond.  The thing I'm not really enjoying is that if i'm playing amazon music and I use the voice to text feature on the phone,  it inturrupts the music.  Yea, that's not really the bad part. Even IPHONE apps do this.  NOW the issue is that to get the amazon music to resume, you first tell alexa to PAUSE the music, then you tell alexa to RESUME the music, and it'll pick right back up where it left off.  SO I would hope they add some more software and firmware tweaks, but it's just a echo in the car.  Nothing else.  OH!  Yea!  FORGOT!...  I was worried I would have to unplug my phone's home made connection to my car to play stuff from the Echo auto..... NOPE, once it's paired with the phone, if you played stuff into your car through your phone, then alexa is right there in the phone.  SO no unplugging and plugging in stuff.

"I love Alexa and the devices I have in my home, but this auto version is absolutely not ready for prime time.  At first, I really liked it.  I've always wanted to add things to my shopping list or play Amazon music or ask about the weather via voice control while I'm driving.  Initial set-up was easy, but things went downhill once I wanted to use the other features in my Camry Hybrid.  It doesn't seem to be able to remotely control the devices in my home, even though I can do that directly through the iPhone app.If I'm listening to Sirius/XM radio, I cannot wake up Alexa via voice control, but instead have to toggle through my audio to Bluetooth, then wake up the Echo Auto.  That's far too distracting if I'm driving.  Next, even when my car is off or the Echo Auto is disconnected, the iPhone app requires me to say that I'm not driving in order to use it, adding yet another annoying step.  Last, in order to work, the Echo Auto needs to be plugged into the car's power outlet.  It does not have a rechargeable battery inside, which means I have to have a cable snaking down from my car vent, across the navigation screen and controls, to the power outlet.  I have no idea why, in this age of wireless devices, Amazon didn't include a rechargeable battery so that this could be used with or without the power outlet.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I finally got my amazon auto almost a year after the invite. So far it works great, and the really cool part is that both Google and Amazon work perfect with each other, which I thought at first they conflict. The only thing Amazon can’t seem to do, or I have not figured out how is when I try to play music from my phone it does not recognize my phone as a source of music. But for now google does and works. Amazon auto will open apps that are on my phone so that is cool. The sound is fricken amazing in my car and when playing music it will let my built in Android EQ handle tone so wow, I was in awe with the sound. Another great thing is that when I turn on my car, I don’t have to do anything, it automatically turns on and says welcome. Love that! Personal touches like that is something I appreciate. Even she opens most of the same apps Google opens for me, oh and another cool thing is that I can say OK Google or Alexa, and they both work together.  Thank you Amazon for a kick-booty hardware.My only problem with the unit is the mount. The magnet works really good, but it will not work in my ac vents and I am trying to search for other mounting products for the auto. For now I have to place it on my shelf where the speedometer is located. Thankfully it’s flat so I can see my gauges .  Other then that I love it.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"For the most part, it worked well.  I used it for directions so I wasn't trying to look at my phone in strange (to me) cities with traffic all around, also to play my music (on Prime) when I didn't want to spend time trying to tune in a station, and more important, to take phone calls while driving.  I moved to be near a very ill sister (who has since passed away) and drove straight through, 16 hours, in my car.  I can say that I relied heavily on Echo Auto for directions and that part worked great.  I should say that since then, the city that I moved to (which is huge), I have had some odd connection issues like Alexa telling me my phone has lost internet connection when I'm out on the road and using it for directions.  Very disconcerting to hear that when you are in rush hour traffic and have no idea where you will be getting off the freeway.  Music works great - shuffling all my music, playing certain artists and other ways of hearing music, Echo Auto works great.  Phone - my sister was so happy that I was coming to be with her that she called me twice while I was on my way, in the car, driving in areas I was not familiar with - I was glad I was able to speak to her, able to tell her I was literally on my way and where I was in relation to her, all by just saying, ""Alexa, pick up the phone.""  I know others have been using different methods for hands-free calling and talking in the car, but this is my first experience with it and it worked quite well.  I gave 4 stars for the odd dropping when Alexa said my phone lost internet connection...it isn't a cheapo phone, nor am I with a cut-rate provider so I'm not sure what that was about.  All in all, I like my Echo Auto.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"Give us a wake word choice! I cringe every time I have to say ""Alexa"" instead of ""Computer""...you have the technology! Please give us a choice! That said...Echo Auto works! Echo Auto > Muse. Had a Muse that promised what the Echo Auto does but was disappointed with the Muse for multiple reasons and stopped using it. However, the Echo Auto is great so far. Echo Auto connects to phone, phone connects to car. I make sure to keep the Alexa app running on my phone and everything just connects whenever I hop in the car. Microphone seems sensitive, doesn't seem to get tripped up with fan noise or music, took a while to realize optimal volume setting for phone calls in the car but everything works the way it should. I was weary of the warning on the instructions about the operating temperature window since cars get quite hot and cold in Wisconsin (+>100 to -<20) but seems to be doing fine in 90 degree outside temp the past couple weeks. The cord clip was glued to the vent mount and fell off, but it isn't critical and doesn't look bad without it, so I'm fine without it. Would love to see a visor clip mount, but so far I'm just happy the device works.

"After a year-long wait, I received my Echo Auto yesterday. While it's not quite perfect, it's pretty close. Until now, I had a Roav Viva to use Alexa in the car. It worked, but the Echo far surpasses it. In the past, whenever, I wanted to give Alexa a command, I had to turn down the radio, close the windows on my car.. even turn off the AC. The 8 microphones on the Echo leave the Roav in the dust. The Echo works when the music is blasting at full power. But what amazed me is that I have a convertible. Tonight, I drove home with the top down in Houston rush hour traffic AND the music at max. Alexa STILL heard me and responded. I could barely hear my own voice!Now nothing is perfect. A lot of people have complained about the Bluetooth connectivity. I had the same problem. I set it up an it worked fine. When I turned the car off... nothing. In short, it only worked once. I was frustrated. Finally, I just plugged it into my aux. jack and everything worked fine. It's a bit annoying to have 2 cables hanging down but I think I'll get used to it.",4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"The issue I haven't been able to overcome with Alexa Auto is that in order to have Alexa speak through the car speakers, I have to connect it as the Audio input and then can't listen to music using my Sirius XM subscription--I can only listen to audio from the phone, which means I have to stream the music and use up data.I might be misunderstanding the way it works.

I had no problem connecting it to my phone or using the app and for the first week everything was great - I started my car, Alexa automatically connected and off we'd go. Then, out of the blue, the issues began. Alexa would connect and disconnect randomly-and no my bluetooth (Samsung Galaxy s8) was working fine staying connected to my car (2012 Honda Civic) and watch- it was just Alexa. Other times, I'd think it was connected and wasn't and if I hoped to use it, I'd have to sit and work to reconnect it over and over. Occasionally, it isn't connected when I think is and just say screw it, only to have my previous music start playing 5, 10 or 30 min later when it connects mysteriously on its own.",3,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"I want to give this a 5-star review, I really do.  It's a great addition to my vehicle and would be to most.  You do need either Bluetooth or an aux jack to make this work and it ties up your phone to use it.My complaint is actually more with the Alexa app required to use this.  It's buggy, it sometimes won't connect quite right or drops at inopportune times.  Also, using this eats data, a lot of it at that.  Using it only sparingly it consumed over 2 Gb over about 2 weeks.  For someone with unlimited data this might be fine but if you're on a regular data plan, it can quickly surprise you with how much it uses.  Also, the app can be infuriating with it's insistence to tell you what it was doing even when not connected to the echo auto.  A reboot clears this, but that's the only way I've found to make it shut up.  Anyway, I'm getting off topic here.",4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"When it works, which is about 33% of the time I ask it something, on a good day, it works great. Most often I get ""sorry I'm having trouble connecting to the network right now, try again later"" this occurs while in my driveway in range of wifi, also while on rural roads, and also on top of high bridges, driving down broad street in Philadelphia and with a direct line of sight of 4+ cell towers with phone showing 5 bars of service. My carrier is Verizon, it's coupled to a 256 Gb IPhone 8S+ with unlimited service and I'm nowhere near my bandwidth cap. Its also fun while listening to Pandora, sometimes the music just stops and goes silent, then its a fight to get it to play anything until you're in a better service area (while phone shows 5 bars cellular and 3 bars of WiFi.Connection issues aside, Alexa has great difficulty making a call (which is main reason why I got it.) I'll ask it ""Alexa, call John Smith"" it beeps, then does nothing, I try again ""Alexa Call John Smith"" heard me this time, now it'll respond ""Do you want to call James Smythson?""  repeat repeat repeat... I created a shortcut in the Alexa App for my friend ""Michele"" Alexa can't understand that, wants to tell me about books by Shel Silverstein or whatever. When she finally understands I'm about ready to throw it out the window, it responds and badly mispronounces the last name for confirmation and makes the call. I've tried helping Alexa understand me clearer by turning off the AC/Heat and speaking loudly, slowly and clearly and moving the mounting location, it doesn't matter.  The Alexa Auto is mounted on the supplied vent clip, in the center of the vehicle, diagonally down to the right and less than 4' from my mouth if I had a ruler.

"I really like the idea, but there are a lot of bugs that need to be worked out.  The two most significant are: 1) Alexa keeps thinking that she hears her name.  The car is a lot more ""active"" place then the home.  The radio is always on, people are talking, and I (for example) listen to a lot of audio books.  I would say that once every other drive she thinks she hears her voice.  2)  There needs to be better integration between the car device and the phone app.  For example, when I ask Alexa to play music using the car device, it is a completely separate process/device than my phone.  It uses the Alexa music app, but if I look at my app, the information is not displayed or accessible (e..g, ability to scroll through songs in an album).  I am sure the developers know what I am talking about.I did like the ability to use my phone hands free and I also tried out a lot of games during road trips, which actually was quite fun and reminded me of how car rides use to be before iPads (sorry Amazon Fire Tablets) were a thing.  Great idea... just needs more refinement.  Oh and last thing, don't even think of buying this unless you have an unlimited data plan on your phone service.",3,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"I will admit I am a tech geek  I have multiple Alexa units in my home and all have met my expectations. I think they are a valuable product when employed effectively. The automotive Alexa to me was not expensive. I drive a 2018 Volvo V60 XC. The car is a mobile wi-fi device as I have an AT&T internet plan that integrates with the Volvo. In my case, the Alexa connects with the car's wi-fi like an Alexa connects with wi-fi at home. In addition to Alexa, my iPhone is mounted in the car. In reality, this makes the systems redundant. One device could do nearly everything if not all that the other can do.  That is something to consider before purchasing. The car you will use the Alexa with must also be a consideration. My Alexa pairs with the Volvo's bluetooth and is integrated with many of the Volvo's onboard internet applications, Sirius, Pandora etc. Alexa voice will start a navigation calculation on the iPhone. It does not integrate with the Volvo onboard navigation system on my 2018.

"Let me start by saying that I am not the smarter when it comes to technology, and not application savvy.  This is the first gadget I buy that I had to do the set up myself, 'cause me daughter was not around to do it for me.  I went thru the set up with very little trouble, not because the echo was not doing what should have, but because I was not following the instructions.  Once I did, walaaaaa, this little thing started working flawlessly.  I set it up thru my Pacifica bluetooth and without failing, every time I start my vehicle and PRESS the MEDIA button, its ready to roll.  Of course, if I don't put the system on the right setting, it will not automatically work, and it might take 10-15 seconds to react, but that is no different than any other gadget I plug in on my USB anyways.  I don't use it as a navigation system, it was not sold for that purpose, but I have been able to get EVERYTHING I get out of my home Alexa and Echo devices.  If you follow the instructions, and check the compatibility prongs before you purchase, you shouldn't have any issues.

"Well, I’m just so sad. Really was looking forward to a great experience. For starters the pictures shown of the air vents aren’t accurate. I have one that was a ‘yes’ but the angle of the car mount is incorrect-would’ve had to look up from the bottom of the driver’s seat to see it. Second not that easy to connect  as even though my car uses Bluetooth to connect I still had to use the aux cord AND every time I got a call that I would answer hands free from my steering wheel the Echo Auto prevented my ability to do so, so I had to use the phone speaker and then the phone would override the Echo Auto and I could re-link on the touchscreen of the sound center. Finally, not to crazy about having 2 cords dangling in front of my radio and A/C controls, could have included some 3M clips for ‘routing’ the cords or I could have bought some separately.

The connectivity issues are horrid. Periodically, even when connected to power, echo auto will stop working altogether...the only way to resolve it is to disconnect its power supply and reboot it.

"Disappointed. I have several Echo devices so felt like I could feel safe in ordering the Echo Auto. When I first hooked it up it took a little figuring out to get it to work and I did. Now it works off & on. When it works, it is awesome. Just like home I can tell Alex to play music I like and it is the music I listen to at home. I haven’t had much luck with adding to a list or asking what is on my calendar though. The sound, when it works, is very impressive; Alexa’s voice is clear and loud even over road noise. I have a soft voice so I was concerned with my voice being heard clearly but doesn’t appear to be a problem at all. Yesterday I could not get Echo Auto to work. I could see the light, but never got any type of voice response, that was a first other than when I was first hooking it up. I know that some companies when they have a new device or software, the first release can be like you are a beta tester, don’t know if that is true but it is troublesome when you learn to trust products only to be disappointed when you learn the quality isn’t there yet.

"I had an invite to buy one of these and did, so I've tested it in two cars for a couple months. Yet, I'm still trying to figure out why this product exists. At the end of the day, it's just a microphone that works with your Alexa app. Because it relies on your phone's Alexa App being active, it ultimately keeps you tethered to your phone despite its seeming intent to free you from your phone. SIRI already has a hands-dree mode that works quite well. And, my iPhone doesn't require me to have any particular app active to use it. Thus, the dependence upon a smartphone running the Alexa app is the downfall of the device. It just seems to have no purpose.",1,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
"I received an invitation to buy and try this item at a reduced cost and went for it.  I have mixed reviews on it.  I had a really difficult time getting it to connect via bluetooth and had to call the amazon hotline.  After a few dozen tries I did get it to connect but not thru the car entertainment system (speakers) just through the device itself.  I was told I would have to call a car dealership (I own a 2016 Ford) to see if they could assist!  Well I went after a few  trial & errors I finally got it to work through my speakers.......I did, as others, got the ""lost connection"" a few times and had to go through the set up procedures a few times after re-starting my car.  But I think I finally got it to work with only a one button on my entertainment system (bluetooth connection to my phone) each time.  It will not auto connect but I think Amazon will improve on this for the second version.  So after all of that I think it works pretty well albeit I do not use it for navigation.  The best think about this is that I can play my music on it and do not have to worry about finding local stations when traveling.....that is huge to me!!!  Overall I think it is worth it but would wait until a second versions comes out!!",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

I started with some simple things like asking Alexa to play a radio station or some music in my amazon music library. Worked great. I could tell her to add something to my shopping list and such. I Asked it for directions and it connected to google maps on my phone and gave me directions. I loved that I did not need to take out my phone and open the maps ap, enter address etc. I also loved that I could tell Alexa to send a text message and I could just speak the message and it would send that message as a text with a link to an audio recording of my voice speaking the message. It really made so many more things hands free and that was great.....WHEN IT WORKS! The reason for my 3 stars is I have been able to do all of these things so I know it can do them but it doesn't always work and I find that so frustrating. Way too often I say Alexa and it lights up and I speak and then nothing... eventually it dings and the light goes out. It would be nice if it at least said. I didn't understand you or please repeat or something to tell you why it simply is not working. I am not asking it to do anything I have not already seen it do. I have also found when it comes to music I can tell my Alexa at home to play a song and it plays right away but in the car it doesn't seem to find the song. So this would and could be a great little device if it worked all the time. When using a hands free assistant you want it to be reliable. I hope there will be updates and improvements to the device making it better in the future. One other warning..... I have to Max out my car stereo volume to hear anything Alexa says and that means remembering to turn it back down when you are not using Alexa. I am surprised I didn't blow my speakers the one time I forgot and switched to FM radio!!!",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"Honestly I wanted this product to be amazing, I'm heavily invested in Amazon products and I wanted this to be an addition for my car, when I installed it and I figured out that you can't change the Wake word, I was a little disheartened but that didn't break the deal for me. What breaks the deal for me is that this thing barely ever picks up my voice, I find myself shouting at it more often than not which is very frustrating since I don't normally raise my voice. It has 8 microphones I don't understand why the sensitivity set so low. With the vent mount that it comes with it puts it right in the way of the AC which makes even more noise to confuse the microphones. So my first thought was to turn the AC basically off, and it still can't hear you. I checked to online to see if anyone else is having issues and everyone else is having the same exact issue, the thing can't hear you. You have to resort to macgyvering it somewhere else on your car that's closer to your face like the visor for it to even kind of work without shouting. (And I say kind of because it still doesn't work sometimes). it has a lot of potential and I really like the fact that you can set location-based routines, but I can already do that on my phone. this needs a firmware update to increase the sensitivity if not it's a paperweight that I'm going to be taking out of my car soon.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I've had my echo auto for about 2-3 weeks now.  When I first set up the echo auto, I had a ton of issues getting the device properly connected. I'm tech-savvy, but this thing did not want to work. Running through the set-up process probably 4-5 times, I finally got it all set-up. Then... I had issues getting the device to work whenever I left my house.  Frustrated with it not working after I left the house, I decided to delete the echo auto from my Alexa app and re-setup the device but disconnecting my wifi on my phone. (My phone was on wifi when I ran through the set-up the first time, thinking that the echo auto wanted to use wifi all the time instead of my cellular connection).  Not entirely sure if that was the cause of everything or not, but I have not had an issue since.  (I do have to wait for my phone to disconnect from wifi, and reconnect to cellular after I leave my house).  I love everything about the Echo devices I use at home, and now I have all those capabilities in my car.  This is the first release of the product, and I'm glad Amazon is working on this product, they'll work out the bugs that are left.  My recommendations - Fix the set-up process, have Alexa give feedback when she's ready to go.  So stupid to hear her say she's lost connection with the Alexa app, and to please fix it by going to the app.  We don't need the same feedback every time. Just let us know when it's ready. Long story short. Still love this product, great job.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"I've had a few problem with the Echo Auto, but overall the experience has been positive.The main issues I've encountered is that sometimes it takes me asking twice before the Echo will do as told.  For example, ""Play NPR"" always takes a second try every morning during my commute.  I'm sure this is something they will work out.",3,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"It worked as advertised for the devices I have set up at home.  However, I do not have an unlimited data plan on my phone and it used a lot of data in the 12 or so hours I had it installed (not in use just installed).  I quickly turned it off on my phone when I got a data usage warning from my cell phone carrier.  I can do everything with the Alexa App that I can do with this item just with an extra step or two.  It is not worth amount of data it will use to leave it on and if I have to turn it on on my phone, then it is no different than the Alexa app.  I will be selling my device as soon as I make sure that I have all of my personal information off of it.",2,1,2019-12-20,1,1,0

"I was skeptical after reading the reviews on purchasing this product but I figured Amazon customer service is pretty good and worst case scenario I could return it. I purchased this for my husband as his Jeep could use a hands free option. Given the reviews saying the set-up was challenging I did it myself. It only took me 5 minutes. For those struggling to set it up I would suggest installing the app ahead of time. Then when you are ready to set up the device drive about a block away from your home so your phone does not struggle with a connection from your home WiFi and you are just using your phones wifi. For myself I know my phone is still connected to my wifi in the garage but the connection is not strong so my phone will stay connected but struggle with even pulling up a Google search. Since this device is dependent on the WiFi connection on your phone you need to make sure where you are setting it up you have enough bars. So far any connections lost it was due to my phone signal not the device itself. After being in my husband's car I wish the features in my car were as easy. This device is not good for you if you have bad service or are in an area where the cell service is bad. I feel some of these bad reviews are not a device issue rather an issue with their phone or cell carrier.As stated, it took 5 minutes to set up, has great sound quality, and has worked for us as advertised. I would highly recommend!",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I love this product. The echo auto is amazing! It does have some key flaws. Firstly, my gf and I share our car, but theres no way to actually connect both of our phones to the one echo auto. If i disconnect, she can reset it to work for her, but that's work we dont want to have to do everytime we get in and out of the car. We would be switching a few times everyday! Supposedly, theres a way to make this work through managing your household settings, but we both have student prime accounts so we cant add each other to our households and share any devices. So this is only great for someone who does not share their car. Secondly, it does take 30 seconds or so to connect to my phone and start working smoothly. It isnt a long time, but its annoying everytime i get in the car and ask for a song it tells me to wait. Lastly, its kind of bulky and annoying. The wires have a tendency to be annoyingly in my way, no matter how i cinch them. Amazon engineers do indeed try to curb this problem by including several sliders that keep the wires together and a place on the mount where the wires can be fed through, but it isnt quite enough to alleviate the problem. These few things aside, the echo auto is amazing. Its just as quick and effective as my home echos. Also, it allows me to control things in my home and use the intercom and announcement features while out on the go. I could feasibly do all these things with my phone, but not with my voice and certainly not while driving. If you can overlook the issues I listed above, this product will satisfy your smart car desires.",4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I waited eagerly for the release of this device. I hoped it would represent an improvement over the ROAV Viva from Anker which was released more than a year before this was announced, much less released.Unfortunately, it is not materially better.",1,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"Update 11/1/19:Still getting use to it, but love it despite some quirks due to my Jeeps UConnect Bluetooth and iPhone interaction. I'm not sure if I should disable the native Bluetooth connection between my iPhone and the Jeeps UConnect or not. It seems my config doesn't play nice with the Echo in this scenario. Still experimenting. I do love the convenience of having Alexa in the car and really can't see doing without it now.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"Why do I have to go through so many steps to connect it to my phone every time? I can play music through my car just by connecting bluetooth and switching to that channel. If I want the Echo to connect, I have to do that and then open the Alexa app, wait for it to recognize I want to connect, and acknowledge that I'm the passenger. The other two frustrations I have is there is no playback progress bar when I listen to Amazon Music via Echo Auto, but if I listen to Amazon Music via Chevy MyLink I have a progress bar along with song information and I also lose timely skipping functionality. When attempting to skip a song through my steering wheel buttons there is a huge response delay and occasional non-response that isn't present without the presence of the Echo Auto.I had a ton of complaints during Beta, but never anything, just realized I could finally review it publicly. Unsurprisingly on a hot summer day you also have to remove the device from your dashboard as the storage heat recommendations would be exceeded, so just one more step.",2,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"I used to have another device which integrated Alexa in my car, but the experience was not great because it did not always hear me or had to turn down all the way down the volume so it could listen to me, or even press the ""Listen"" button to activate it. Plus it required an extra app to work and did not have all the functions an Echo device have, for example, Spotify.That's why I decided to get the Echo Auto, if the problems persisted probably Alexa was not meant to be in my car, but I was surprised to discover it works amazingly. I only needed to connect it to the power, the audio AUX, and to my phone via Bluetooth and done. The microphones work great even if my music is loud, or if there's a lot of noise because of road conditions. I don't need any extra apps, just the Alexa app I already use with the rest of my Echo devices.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"This Alexa device saved me from having to buy a generic bluetooth connection device for my car, as my car only has bluetooth for handsfree phone operation, and not for music. Having the Echo Auto is a great bonus, being able to use it like a normal Alexa, minus one or two small features (which I wish they could update. i.e. she will not allow the feature to open my garage door from my car, which she does on Alexa devices in my home). It operates a little bit slower than typical Alexa devices, so requires a bit of patience at times, and you have to make sure you connect it to power point in your car that turns off when you shut off your car. I made that mistake in the beginning, and had it connected to a power point that is directly connected to the car battery, and my iPhone was still connected to the Echo Auto while I was walking around the house, and could not figure out why my phone was not working properly. User error in this situation. It powers up and connects fast to your phone. Great device for the price I paid for it. Everyone should buy a device like this for hands free driving, and stop trying to use your damn phones while you are driving!!!",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I've had Echo Auto for about 3 months now. Overall I'm more impressed than expected. Based on prior experiences with different Bluetooth auto devices and reviews of a non- Amazon device for Alexa I expected responsiveness and usefulness to be variable at best. My actual experience has been very positive. There was a short-term glitch with installation (didn't sync with app) but disconnecting, resetting and starting over fixed that. No problems since. It connects automatically with Alexa app on my phone each time I get in the vehicle. There's a slight delay in responding to verbal commands but comprehension and success rates are high. It's also improved the overall Bluetooth connectivity when using other apps in the vehicle (including that other Android assistant, music streaming, audio books). I find it very handy for weather and news updates, looking up information, accessing Amazon music unlimited, and hands-free phone use. If you haven't used Alexa before it's probably a somewhat steep learning curve, but if you use her at home, office etc then the commands are natural. Good job Amazon! A gteat value product that's a very useful mobile technology tool!",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"I commute every day to work 40-50 minutes. So I can pick any music I want and, ""Alexa, play Maroon 5"" or whatever. I can also listen to my Audible books in the car. If I want to use the GPS I can but I prefer it on my phone because I like to see the turns and route. If I am doing math in my head (not my strongest skill) I have Alexa do it. I can ask simple questions when I am driving. If I am lost, I can ask what town I am in. I don't know why all the negative reviews here. I can send an email or text to someone. (Ok, it takes a while to get that right the first few times.) I can have Alexa call someone on my contact list. (Same as last skill, need to play with it a few times at first.) The only thing is the cord. I have a camera and now my Alexa so I have cords that sometimes get in the way. But I don't know how else Amazon could do it. The bottom pad is sticky (like rubber) but not stick on. So you can move it easily. There are a few times when the Echo lost connection and says the device hasn't been used for a while so you have to ask it to do something again. But this has really made such a big change in my driving experience to work or wherever. I have had an Echo since they first came out and I was one of the first to buy this Auto Echo. It may not be to everyone's taste but I LOVE it!",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"Was easy to install and works pretty good. The sound quality is much better than my Sirius XM car radio. In fact I would listen to a song on the satellite, then ask Alexa to play the same song and the difference was impressive. Now I am thinking do I really need  to pay for Sirius each month? I'll give it a month or two before I decide.Update: It has exceeded  my expectations so I bought another one and installed it in the wife's car.  Her Toyota Avalon Limited has a real nice sound system but the Sat radio (Sirius XM) never did sound that great in spite of all my tweaking. Well now with Echo Auto it will blow you away. Lots of bass and clear treble. Plus she loves it to update her shopping lists while driving. So a few days ago I called Sirius  and cancelled my subscription which I have had for many many years (they tried their best to keep me on). It was kind of sad but I have not used it for months. As a child of the fifties and sixties I was happy when Sirius started the Beatles channel a few year back but annoyed by all the later Beatles crap they played. Now I tell Alexa ""Play Beatles songs from 1963 or 1964"" and I get the songs I like best. So now I save 35 bucks a month and get the music I like.  Too bad I am retired now and don't drive like when I was commuting. This would have been great!",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"** Updated 8 December, 2019 **Amazon Support read my original review, and called me to discuss my issues and offer some potential resolution. I spoke at length with a very friendly, knowledgeable technician. Some of the suggestions offered were a bit onerous to carry out, but at the end of it all, there was some noticeable improvement in the Echo Auto's performance. The condition I described where playback speed varied wildly (Barry White to the Chipmunks) ceased and has not come back. The very annoying non-responsiveness issue has been mostly eliminated, as well as the choppy, clipped device voice responses. For the most part, the Echo's responses sound exactly like those of my home devices. Now I notice it only sporadically, mostly when I'm in areas with a very poor cellular signal.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"This device isn't bad.  I've had it in my car for a couple of months now.  The only problem is that it doesn't always work seamlessly with the bluetooth connection.  I do not have bluetooth in my car currently so I'm running it through my phone's data.  It doesn't seem to eat the data or kill my battery exceptionally faster than normal.  When it is connected appropriately (which is probably 80% of the time) it does work really well.  I've never had it drop a call.  Everyone says that they can hear me fine when I use it for calls.  My biggest complaints with the call quality is that I have to turn my radio all the way up to actually hear the caller on my end even though they can hear me fine.  I'm mainly using the device to make and answer calls, play music, and listen to podcasts and Audible.  I've used it for directions once and wasn't impressed at all.  It's just easier to set up navigation on my phone.  Plus I usually get an error notification when I ask Alexa to do it.  Now, that could be because I have a Google phone vs something like an Apple or Samsung.  I'm sure that this was designed in mind for one of those brands.  My only other observation has to do with Audible.  For whatever reason, when you ask Alexa to play Audible she doesn't always save your place or sync it across devices.  I'm in the car for 1-2 hours at a time so that's a little annoying when I have to go back and figure out where I was in the book on another device.  I haven't tried other devices of this type, so I can't compare it to anything else on the market.  If you're like me and have a car without any hands free capability, this is probably a good option for you especially at the price point.  I would just be aware that it's not perfect.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"On the one hand, this gadget does nothing you can't already do with your cell phone if you have voice activation turned on (e.g., ""hey siri""), the Alexa app, and your preferred streaming sources.  So the value added is very small.  On the other hand, it does have the Echo-standard microphone array that does a great job of speech recognition (except when road noise is high).  The device connects immediately to my iPhone 10s when the car starts, so all I have to do is switch the radio to aux/bluetooth input.  Everything you have set up in the Alexa app is accessible via this device.  In a long road trip, I found it to be useful for streaming music, podcasts and news using the skills I had already set up for home use.  Eliminates the need for satellite radio, but service depends on coverage of your cell phone network.Note that the device connects to your cell phone via bluetooth, not your personal hotspot.  Depending on your plan, this might make a difference in operating cost.",3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"We have 6+ Echo devices. The Echo Auto misses the mark. The concept of Alexa in a vehicle is great, especially with more states adopting a hands-free law. The design of the Echo Auto is awful.1) Your vehicle input *must* be on Bluetooth for Echo Auto to work. This is advertised and was understood prior to purchasing but in practice it’s poor design. You can’t listen to the radio or a CD if you want Echo Auto listening for the “Alexa” wake word. You could listen to radio over an Internet app but it’s an extra step to setup. CDs aren’t as popular now but it’s nice to have that option.",1,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"I really wanted this product.  I was on the waitlist for an invitation to the Echo Auto for almost a year.  I have a 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan that has an aux in port, and bluetooth for calls only, but no way to stream music.  I would have just replaced the radio with one that supports bluetooth, but the built-in one has a hard drive to store music and is an unusual size, encouraging me to keep it.  Enter the Echo Auto - based on the description, it solves all my problems.  Mount it in the car, connect to the aux port, and I can voice control music, maps and more. I was SO excited.Except it can't do those things.  At least, not well.  By far, my biggest complaint is the 8 ""far field"" microphones in the unit.  They hear nothing.  I mounted the unit on my car vent per the instructions, and the flow of air out of the vent and over the device (even on the lowest setting) confuses the device to the point it can no longer understand instructions. ""Alexa..."" goes unanswered, as the assistant is unable to hear me even sitting at a standstill if any air is flowing through the vents.  In addition, the mount isn't adjustable, nor is the unit, meaning it will be in the positive Amazon decided regardless of how your car is built.  If I could tilt mine to face me, I bet that would solve the voice recognition issues- but I can't.  Finally, the wire management is poor and can be annoying.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"I have an older car with an AUX port and no other phone integration of any kind. So I figured this would be a helpful device. I don't regret purchasing it (but I'm glad I got it for a $25 beta price). It's not really hands free because half the time I'm searching for a playlist on the Amazon music app. But I do occasionally make requests that Alexa can accommodate like ""play 90s music"" or ""play Johnny Cash."" I do like being able to play games while I'm sitting in the car line waiting to pick up my son from school. My favorite being Song Quiz. I also like when I play a game on my phone (parked) like Pokemon Go, all my battle sounds from raiding can be played through the car's speakers lol.But it loses connection a lot. That's partly my cell phone carrier's problem. But it also doesn't connect automatically via bluetooth when I get in the car. I have to open my Alexa app and touch the ""i'm a passenger button"" before it will connect most of the time. Sometimes it gets confused and won't play my music even though the correct device has been chosen I have to turn it off (pull it out of the cigarette lighter) to restart it.

"I’m not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I LOVE the Echo Auto. We are an Alexa family, with a show, a couple of dots, anEcho, and an old Tap (my first;). I had no trouble getting it to work. I already had an adapter for my  IPhone since they no longer have audio jacks. But I ended up plugging my auxiliary cable into the Echo (so the sound goes through my speakers) leaving my phone plugged into the adapter and both my phone and echo power/charger cords plugged into the dual 12v plug (thanks for the dual plug Amazon!). I open the Alexa app on my phone and tap the “I’m a passenger” bar (Amazon, it should recognize when I’m not moving and not require me to say I’m a passenger). Then the echo connects to my phone via my phone’s blue tooth and the sound goes through the auxiliary jack to my speakers. I can play music off of prime music, ask her to play iHeartRadio or pandora (I haven’t tried Spotify yet), ask for directions (works most of the time), add to my shopping list, call someone in my my contacts, etc.  Even when I use Waze (haven’t figured out how to get her to use waze rather than iPhone maps), as long as I don’t exit out of the Alexa app, the waze directions still go through my speakers.

"IMPORTANT TIP For those those cannot hear audio thorugh car speakers even though they have bluetooth.I just installed my Echo Auto yesterday and I spent a huge amount of time trying to get the map directions and audio to come from my Car Speakers.  The phone worked fine but nothing else, like Google Maps directions or any other service offerced by Alexa. So I went back to Google and searched and low and behold found a cure. Apparently some new phone for some years also had this problem like my new Samsung S10+ did. If you go to the Google Play store and download Audio BT plus, costs $1.99, that will make the fix you need. They also have a free version but since this was important to me, what is a couple bucks to get the better version. Anyway, it worked withing seconds and now Audio is on my car bose stereo speakers.  I am pretty jazzed as you might guess.  So far I like my Echo Auto especially since I am a big Alexa fan at home owning an Echo tower, Echo Show5 and and the big Echo Show.

"I got this hoping that it would be the fix for pitiful Bluetooth phone function in my car and it is.  I carefully followed the directions and it paired right away with my phone and connected to my car Bluetooth.  It (she) works perfectly.

I'm sure people in other cars around me thought there was something wrong with me.  I have to say that I have 6 Alexas in my home and am so glad to have her in my car too.  She knows my voice and calls who I ask her to call without any problems or having to raise my voice.  The only problem was I had to figure out why she was failing to send text messages.  What I discovered is that my Samsung has ""MMS"" as a text message system and I needed a ""SMS"" app.  I found a nice one that does both MMS and SMS and problem solved.  I can now ask her to send a message to one of my contacts while I'm driving.  I tell her what I want to send and she does it.....  No problem.

"I really wanted to love this, but it needs some work. The voice activation is just sub-par and is too delayed to work correctly. We don’t even use ‘Alexa’ voice commands anymore because it does not work. Maybe it’s noise from driving, or the road, etc., but it doesn’t hear the correct commands. Also, the response time is DELAYEDDDDD. We adjusted the response time in the Alexa app and it didn’t fix the problem. Imagine talking to someone and 20 seconds in, they go “Whattttt?” every time. So, then we started using the button instead of voice activation, but it’s still delayed and we have to repeat ourselves about 70% of the time (I enunciate very clearly so we know that’s not the problem). I WISHHH it worked like all of our home devices, but alas, it does not.Oh, and another thing, it doesn’t call the right people. I don’t know if other people have had this issue, but if I say “Call so-and-so”, it sometimes calls their number from a decade ago, that’s no longer saved in my phone, instead of their current number.

"I bought this after requesting for the invite for a loooong time. I was surprised when I finally could buy it. The original invite price was around $24.99 but I had some in-store credit so it was just $16! The device itself is easy to integrate into your vehicle software-wise, but I just wish the physical integrations were better. The little air-vent attachment is nice, but it renders your A/C vent unadjustable. It also blocks some of the A/C which isn't good if you park your car in the sun. I guess you could just not use the air vent attachment but then you'd have to find some place to put it where it won't fly off when you hit a speed bump or make high velocity turns. Hopefully there will be more attachments for sale on Amazon Basics or by third-party dealers here.What we have here is somewhat of a limited version of Alexa. I'm not sure if this is true or if it's just me, but my experience with a regular Alexa device vs Echo Auto is that the Alexa in the Auto is less responsive. Like, she doesn't say as many things? Hopefully a software patch will upgrade her. The settings on the Alexa app for the Auto is also a little different. On the Echo Dot or whatever, you get to turn on Follow-Up Mode, but on the Auto you don't. So if you say someone and it doesn't follow up, you have to keep re-calling her name over and over so it can be annoying. Additionally, I wish this version of Alexa would have a GPS function. Like have Alexa tell you when to turn or what street to go to. I don't even need a visual GPS, an audio based one would be awesome.",4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I wanted to love this Alexa Auto. I love my Alexa integrated gadgets in my house and I wanted to love this Alexa Auto just as much, but sadly, it has too many kinks as of right now. I drive for Uber, Uber Eats, and Lyft. Needless to say, I spend a lot of time in my car.I have a 2014 Kia Soul. I hooked up the Alexa Auto using the wireless setting because I have blue-tooth capabilities in my car. Essentially the only wire I have connected to it is the power cord. I keep the Amazon Alexa app open and running the whole time I use Alexa Auto. Many times I ask it to play my music and it says ok, but then nothing happens. I repeat the request and again, nothing happens. It does work on occasion, but I would say less than 50% of the time.",2,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
Note: I am using this device with the audio jack into a cassette adapter for my 2002 Buick Century for reference. I cannot vouch for it using bluetooth to the car sound system.Ordered this by invitation early on for about $25 which I think is a good price for this device. Note that in order to use this you must bluetooth to a phone with a data connection or it doesn't work. Alexa doesn't work without internet.,3,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"You will have a much better experience just putting an Echo Dot in your car. This thing is a complete joke and the person at Amazon responsible for this mess should be fired. I should also be given a credit in my account for the pain and suffering I have experienced with this purchase. Do not be fooled by the name of this product.  A better name would be the Discount Car Microphone, because this is NOT an amazon product. There is no way any executive at Amazon is utilizing this product in any meaningful way.

First one that came earlier this year came with an air vent mount and a dash mount. The second one (this review) came with air vent mount only. No 3rd party dash mounts that fit the recessed square on the bottom exist.My car has auto stop/start to conserve fuel. When starting back up the power to charging port is interrupted and causes Echo Auto to restart. Annoying when listening to music. I have a dedicated USB outlet for iPod/iPhone playback that doesn't lose power when starting that I used instead. Beware if your vehicle has auto start/stop.,2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"So when I first received Alexa for my car I was really not all that impressed.  It seemed like there were many issues but since this was a new product I figured they had to work out the kinks.  I would like if Alexa Echo Auto had a little carrying case with it.  I really don't want to leave her in the car because of the likelyhood of someone trying to break in when they see something that looks interesting, so a case in the future would be great.I have sync in my car so it was easy to get use to connecting alexa.  I just have to switch to bluetooth audio and usually she is ready to do.  Once in a while there is a glitch where she will not connect but we simply unplug her and plug her back in and all is good.  I have not used all of the different features because there are so many but if there is a specific song I want to hear she finds it (I am signed up for unlimited music) she plays my music that I have already purchased on alexa, she tells my jokes.. I actually have fun with her at times lol.  I really Enjoy having an alexa in the car just as much has having her in the house.  So yes I recommend purchasing Alexa Auto.",4,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I purchased this product on invitation from Amazon as I felt it might be nice to let my voice do the work of playing music, making calls etc. Alexa Auto has been a very big disappointment. I was using this in a 2019 Toyota Highlander.It took 45 minutes to get Alexa Auto setup. It did not wan to connect to the Alexa App. After getting the setup resolved it decided to lose the connection to the Alexa App and I could not get it to reconnect until the next day after recieving a half page of things to try from Amazon Support. I used the product in my ar for 30 days with many issues.To use Alexa Auto you are supposed to say ""Alexa"" then wait for the chime to issue a command. I did this everytime I wanted to give Alexa instruction. About 50% of the time Alexa just plain acted dumb and did not perform the requested action without multiple attempts. Many times Alexa performed the requested task wrong or performed a copmpletely unrelated task. Alexa no longer resides in my car. And soon Alexa will no longer reside, in my home. I have tested Google extensively and the aggrevation level is much lower. Amazon may have been the first to come out with this type of product but just adding capability that performs poorly a lot of the time does not make me want the product.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!",2,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"11/09/19:  Spent over two hours trying to set it up.  When I was finally successful, I couldn't pull up my playlists from Amazon Music Unlimited, even though I was signed in.

"The ONE reason I wanted this thing was to be able to ask Alexa to open my garage as I drove into my neighborhood.  I can already start music with my phone.  I can already use other voice services to get weather and directions etc....the home automation integration here was my number one thing I wanted.  Got it all hooked up and said ""Alexa unlock the garage""...it tells me it doesn't support it.  EVERY other Alexa device I own asks me for a voice code and then opens the garage.  Not the one in my car?!?!  Come on...that's dumb.Aside from that...the connection to my iPhone is flaky, even when the Alexa app is open it yells at me that it lost connection.  When it works...it works well.  I can check the weather, add shopping items, ask it to find me a gas station or restaurant (the maps integration is a little weak since I don't have a touch screen in my 2013 vehicle).  But all in all...it works MOSTLY.",3,1,2019-10-29,1,1,0
"We love the Echo units we have in our house.  As a result, I was super-excited about the Echo for my car.  Unfortunately, this tech is not quite ready for prime time.  With my echo-auto unit, I would say that Alexa successfully executes about 1 out of every 4 commands I send her way.  The rest are met with a host of responses, such as ""I am having trouble connecting to the Internet"" {even though my phone indicates plenty of signal strength], ""I am having trouble connecting to Audible,"" ""I can't find. . . ""  Or, at times Alexa just seems to ignore my commands altogether (I get no response at all).  I have also noticed that when I connect to one of my Audible books through the Alexa auto unit, that Audible often fails to correctly log the time on the book (i.e. when I go back into the book, it starts at the wrong spot).  Anyway, I am hoping that at some point this tech will get much better, so that my relationship with Alexa in my car will be much healthier (at present, our relationships is very strained--as I spend way too much time being cross with her and far too many of our interactions end in anger and animosity :).",1,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0

This was not to be.The first time I set it up I followed the directions to a T but it would not show up in my app on my iPhone. I went through the setup a few times and it finally worked, even though I didn’t do anything different. So don’t give up, it will finally connect sooner or later. That is, until you turn off the car to get gas or something. Then you have to go through the whole connection process again. Maybe once. Maybe 5 times. But it never would connect on its own.

"I have used this for two months.I really wanted to love this device. I wanted the same experience I have in my home with this in my auto. I was even willing to understand the limitations of the device needing to be connected through my phone for connectivity.

This is a joke.  The device is not compatible with my vehicle.  I received this as a gift so it was well intentioned.  On the flip side my 2018 Dodge Ram 2500 is not compatible and the only option available for connecting this device to my truck is a audio cable through the line in input.  Good thing! (I’m being sarcastic) I Absolutely think the device is ugly as well. Who wants to mount and unmount this device as they enter and exit their vehicle.  The one cord requirement is awful and was not thought out at all.  You must use a USB port to power it. Which means you will have at least that cord running from console to vent which is severely limiting.  You can’t hardwire it in or have any attempt at professional installation.But then again that’s only if you don’t have one of the few cars with which these clever engineers can’t figure out how to connect with.  Save the money. Install the Alexa app on your phone and connect your phone to your car.  Same thing.,1,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
"Just as others (many others) have mentioned, I purchased my Alexa Auto with high expectations, hoping for the same kind of experience we have with Echo Dots in the house.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.I spent hours, I mean HOURS, at least five different times to set this up.  Three months later it's finally hooked up - after several sessions with tech support - but it has to have both the USB and Auxiliary plugs to work, and I have to put my radio on Auxiliary in order to receive any sound.  (It's in a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe.)  We have Sirius XM radio in this car and I use it for my music, not Amazon.",1,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"Not for use in rural areas lacking civilized internet connectivity as the connection will fail, and when it drops Alexa won't shut up about it, adding stress to any drive. Huge areas where I travel in NC (though w/in 40 miles of the capital, Raleigh) are embarrassingly unable to support even 3G, so it's just as well I got my device at a lower, early adopter price, and with gift cards,as it's basically useless. I would never depend on this for travel info even in 21st century areas, too much could go wrong. I stick to travel apps on my phone, which is much more reliable than the Alexa in near-dead zones.Setting it up was easy, but having to add an mp3 connection and a power cord to my existing snaking cords is messy in my tiny Honda Fit. So between that and the lack of internet viability when traveling, my device and its necessary cables remain in a glove compartment.",2,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I was excited to install the Echo Auto, but it was trouble form the start. The echo was slow to respond, and the sound quality was so poor I could barely hear it, despite turning up the volume. So, you keep the volume way UP to hear distorted Echo Auto, so when the normal radio is on, or you receive a call through the Bluetooth, you have blasted ear drums. Strike 1. Next problem, inconsistent connections.  It is going off your cell service of course, but if you live in areas with sketchy cell service, it's a no go.  However, I was right next to a cell tower and it still would not connect (poor receiver?, I was able to use my cell browser with no problem) I don't know but strike 2. Finally, many cars, mine included (a 2019), do not allow more than one blue tooth connection at the same time. Imagine if both you and your SO have phones connected through the stereo at the same time, both talking on the phone, etc.- it doesn't work.  So to make Echo work I have to disconnect my phone and music. Unless you use Echo non-stop in the car, it doesn't interface very well. Turn it on, turn it off. I tried using the AUX cord, but with the cell phone charger cord, the Echo charging cord and now the AUX cord, it was a pile of junk swinging all over the dash. A distracting hazard and an open invitation to thieves that you have easy to steal electronics on board. No thanks, strike 3. I wanted something simple so I could say, Echo, add...to my shopping list, I didn't expect full functionality like at home, but I expected more than this. So, I sent it back. Hopefully they work some of the kinks out.",1,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"After my wife bought me one for Christmas, I bought one for her as a gift.  After fighting with setup (if you specify Bluetooth, you can NOT change it easily back to aux in), and then after fighting the setup for the one for my wife (if you want to use Bluetooth, make SURE you set it up while in the car and connected from your phone), we thought everything was golden.  The Echo Auto works well if mainly what you want to do is play music.  However, the one in my wife's car cuts out in the middle of speaking, before it plays the song.  If you want it to do anything else, well, this makes it pretty useless.  For example, ""Alexa, tell us a joke"" led to: ""How do you remove a shark's teeth?""  And then silence.  I then turned to the trusty Internet and found this is apparently a known issue that Amazon has not addressed, and that for others, who may want to use this device for reminders for example, it's completely useless because it cuts out before the time of the event.I'd switch her device to aux in, but she does not have the port in her car for it, but it works fine in my car set up that way., other than I have to unplug and restart it about once per trip (after which it works just fine).",3,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"I had signed up for Alexa auto and after a long wait I finally got it. Setup was easy and it paired and worked with 2019 Audi. However, it loses connection after turning off the car. I've been using it now for close to a month and in short, it's not ready for prime time - just like what others have said. Fast forward to 1 month later, the device seems t to be connecting automatically even after turning off the car but still has issues with feedback to command. For instance, after 5-10 minutes of turning on the car Alexa Auto would only respond to playing music and flash news.  It doesn't respond to commands such as 'what time is it?' Or ' what's the weather?' until after 30 minutes or so. Very strange. Hoping Amazon would release system updates to fix these issues...PLEASE.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I've had the device since August and wanted to wait before I reviewed it. I have about 5 echo devices including the show several dots and that mini show. So Alexa and I have a love hate relationship.  I've called her out her name on many occasions.  She barely gets any of my requests. The other day an Alexa commercial was playing through her and every time it said her babe it would stop and make that sound she makes when she is listening.  I laughed. She is good for me to play music, get my daily news briefing and the weather.  Sucks at directions.  If you ask me product is cool for $25-$30 anything over $50 is not worth it. But I love her so we are going to stay together. I expect her to get better and eventually come to life sho she can cook and clean for me, so I'll be patient.So if Alexa is in your life already you need to get this.  Yes it has some issues: uses your one car plug (Comes with a double charger), the little holder doesn't work for all cars (mine is cool), she doesn't hear you when you play music loud unless you yell, and she barely gets your request right.  Even with all that -it is great for me because I am already entrenched in the Amazon Alexa cult kind of like those Apple people :)",4,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
I was excited to get the Echo Auto. I have an older car. Echo Auto adds new technology to the mix to make my life easier when driving.There are 3 major issues that I experience:,2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I’ve been using Alexa devices since they were released. I still use the original Echo and Echo Tap all the time. I also have the Spot and 7 Dots(original and new generation). The echo auto reminds me of the original devices with it’s difficulty connecting to devices. Amazon has done a great job simplifying this process tremendously on newer echo devices for home. But the Echo Auto reminds me somewhat of the more difficult process they used to involve, except that it loses its connection easier than those first gen. devices did. I’ve only been able to use it about 60% of the time that I’ve had it because it loses connection and refuses to reconnect regardless of how many times I try. (And through the years and many devices I’ve gotten very good at troubleshooting echos).When it is working it’s a little slow to respond but it’s very handy. If not for the connection issues I’d be happy with it for the most part. Although it is disappointing that when my drive ends and I put in headphones and get out of the car I can’t continue the song from my phone. For some reason the Echo Auto streams from the phone but the Alexa app can’t continue the same audio that was being streamed.",3,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I believe this product could be better. I understand this product depends on your phone but it has a hard time connecting and I'm constantly on my phone trying to connect and get music to play through this device. Kinda defeats the purpose especially in the car. Unless I turn my music on through the show alexa on at home before I leave - then it will pick up right away.I have used it once or twice for future weather but I just don't find Alexa to be that useful in the car especially with depending on connecting with apps on your phone. I've gotten frustrated with connection and just turned on the radio several times. I would love to say ""Turn on/off my ADT"" when I leave/arrive, but that has never worked. The volume always is super low when I actually do connect to alexa for music which then causes me to play with my phone to adjust volume.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I have several Alexa enabled devices, but this is absolute garbage, and completely useless. Threw it it the trash and completely disgusted I spent the intro price of 25 bucks. Glad it wasn't more. As I mention, I have several devices, and have no problems setting up and operating. But this auto echo has been an exercise in blood pressure control trying to connect and maintain connection. I have bluetooth enabled, location enabled, go thru the proper setup, etc...more often than not I need to forget the device, and start from scratch to setup and pair with vehicle. Then, when you finally do manage a connection, Alexa states that your commands and music will play thru another device (your phone, which is how you manage the connection in the first place) rather than thru your car audio system. Then on even more rare occassions, it will work properly thru your car audio system - BUT, only as long as your car is running. Turn off your car, run into a store, come back, start up the car - and you will NOT get that connection again. You start back at square one all over.

"I have only had it for about a week, but wanted to get this review out there before holiday's in case someone is on the fence.  So I have an older car that doesn't have Bluetooth.  With a hands free driving law in my state I needed something help me with audio functions.  The Echo auto is perfect.  I have an aux port so I use that for audio. Set up was pretty straight forward.  Took about 5 minutes and so far I haven't had any issues connecting through my phone.  I get in my car, start the car, plug in the power into the cigarette lighter and so far by the time I am heading out of the driveway I am connected.  I have received and made calls, received and sent texts, listen to radio and used navigation.  I have to work out the correct commands because sometimes Alexa doesn't respond as I expected but I think sometimes I need to make sure I wait for the ding to show it is listening.  I have actually started to just listen to the regular radio, rather than using Alexa and radio app.  The front of the Echo lights up so I just press the AUX input and ask Alexa to answer the call or read the text.  The color of the front light bar is different depending on the type of message you receive.  I have a few smart items in my house, I am hoping to try out remote control (turn on lights, turn up heat etc) soon.  But so far I couldn't be happier!",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

"I just love my Alexa Auto! I never drive anywhere without Alexa now, and to me, she's perfect. The key to her working, once she's connected properly the first time is to wait about a minute for her to start up and connect to your phone (if using bluetooth as I do---otherwise, you use the cable it comes with). With Amazon Music Unlimited, you're virtually able to play anything!j And when I'm using my car's navigation, Alexa automatically lowers in volume whenever the navigation speaks. I have Sirius XM in my car, and if you have streaming with Sirius, Alexa works with that as well. I just say, ""Alexa, play 60's on SiriusXM, and there you go!While it comes with a vent clip, you really don't even need that if you have a place to set it. I have a little holder at the bottom of my dashboard, and I just sit it there. It picks up your voice so easily, it really doesn't matter where I place it. And it's wonderful to not even fuss with any buttons when I want to make a phone call, as I just say, ""Alexa, call home,"" and the call is placed. Virtually, anything you can do with an Echo, you can do with Echo Auto, even having it ready your books from Audible.

"This product has changed my commute to school for the better. I hate driving, like absolutely detest it. Unfortunately in Texas, it's pretty difficult to avoid driving, especially when you live in a different city than your university. I usually try to make driving less monotonous by listening to podcasts, the radio, Spotify, or audiobooks, and I still do. The difference now is that instead of having to pause and choose what to listen to with the expectation that I will have to listen to it for my entire commute with no breaks to use my phone to change from music to an audiobook or to skip songs or go back, I now have a very easy voice control to accommodate my fickle auditory tastes without risking ending up in a ditch or smashed against the back of an eighteen-wheeler.Occasionally there are connection issues with getting it to connect to the app or to Spotify but they usually resolve themselves with a quick reboot of the app or a quick unplug and replug. This only affects the voice control. Otherwise, I love that I can just get in my car and my phone automatically connects via Bluetooth directly and I can play audio through my phone rather than through the Alexa app, if I so choose, guaranteed.

"I just set this up yesterday, but here are my first impressions....It's great having an Echo in the car, and it's definitely worth that I paid (I bought the 2 pack over Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale time, so they were only $25 each). However, my gripes begin with the naming....Unlike other Echo devices, you can neither change the wake word (from Alexa to Echo, as I've done with all other Echos), nor can you change the device's name in the Alexa app, to make it easily distinguishable between multiple Echo Autos. I guess the developers live in NYC and don't realize that the majority of homes in the US have at least 2 vehicles. Apparently they also just wanted to screw over families who have a member named Alexa. I mean really...what are they supposed to do in the car, where everyone is all within a 10ft radius of the Echo Auto? Every time one kid says his/her sister's name, the Echo Auto will wake up. That's lame! I set most of my Echo's to wake up to ""Echo"" rather than ""Alexa"" just in case my daughter winds up with a friend named Alexa (it would just be my luck). I didn't wanna get used to saying that and then have to change it. So now here I am all used to saying ""Echo"" and now I find out I can't in the car. Ugh.

I thought it would be easier to play Pandora music mainly and other simple things, but it was more of a hassle than anything else, particularly due to all the wires.Maps/GPS was really a failure for me because I am a visual person and I want to SEE the map.

There is a Micro-USB power cable running down my dash from the device to the cigarette lighter plug outlet and another cable from the device to the Aux port of my car stereo -- two cables for one device is not elegant. The device's vent mount blocks my AC vent almost entirely, plus I already had a vent mount for my phone and now my whole dashboard looks crowded and covered in cables. It's also angled weirdly, and the Echo device does not sit flat because of the curve in my AC vent.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
I absolutely love this device.  I use it everyday since the day I got it.  3 weeks approximately.  The set up was very simple.  The Alexa app tells you step by step how to set up.  I think with my 2016 Nissan Altima and my Samsung Galaxy note 10 plus it took me 10 seconds to have it completely hooked up and ready to go.  Every morning/evening I get in my car Alexa automatically connects and plays last thing I listened to.  I then ask “Alexa fastest way home.” She then navigates my way home any accidents along way and she asks if I want to change route to save time.  She even warns me of reported speed traps along the way.This is the exact device I needed but had no idea I needed.  I love that when I am anywhere in my car I can turn on and off different things just like when I am home.

Can’t there be a way to connect to my phone/phone’s data without opening the app?

"My car is a 2010 Honda CRV.  It has a usb connection to integrate a phone or iPod to the car's audio system, but it has no Bluetooth and no audio jack.  These are the  two ways the directions say to add Echo Auto to a car - connect with Bluetooth or via an audio cable into the car's audio jack.  The set up should be simple, since the Echo tells you what to do and asks questions about your progress, but it didn't like my answers.  Finally, I just did as I was told and inserted a stereo cable into the audio jack of the Echo with the other end going nowhere.  That satisfied the Echo's requirements and got me out of the setup loop.  The echo then it linked to my phone via Bluetooth, bypassing the car's audio system entirely.  So how does that work?  Well, the sound output is very weak, but I can ask Alexa questions (what time is it, what's the weather, what's on my to do list and have her add items to my lists.)  I cannot play music from my phone through the echo to the car's sound system, but if I wanted to do that, I would just hook up my phone to the usb (the Echo uses that for charging).  I am sure, with a newer car, I would enjoy the better sound level, but I am happy to have Alexa on board to take notes when I need her to.",2,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0

"I was skeptical at first, but love my Echos in the house. Setup was a breeze and form factor is not as annoying as I was expecting. It sits nicely on a vent. With car power on, it connects quickly and is ready to respond within about 15 seconds. Which on that note, Alexa has about a 85% response rate. Meaning, I say ‘Alexa, what’s the weather?” and actually get a response. Sometimes the light blinks, it makes the appropriate sound,  but then nothing. I ask again and about half the time it will work. This could be the iphone as well, the cellular connection, or the Bluetooth so I don’t entirely blame E Auto.I do commend Amazon as I’ve noticed over time progressive improvement to the response and connection issues I first had.

"One of my biggest issues is that I cannot change the wake word for this device, and my daughter's name is Alexa, so every time I say my daughter's name (which is constantly), Echo Auto listens and responds.  It is so annoying, that I disconnect it often.  I am assuming (and hoping) that this changes very soon, and I will have the option of changing the wake word to Echo, like every other Alexa device we own.  The device is frequently offline, and I usually have to ask a question or say a command over and over again in different ways until it understands what I am saying.  It misunderstood the person's name I asked it to call, and ended up calling someone else, and it was really difficult to hang up (it took so long that the person answered--it was NOT someone I wanted to talk to and was pretty embarrassed by the situation).  It would be nice if I the Echo had a ""Cancel"" wake work so will automatically cancel whatever the Echo is doing when you say ""cancel"".  Having to say ""Alexa"", and then wait for it light up, then say ""cancel"" is too long.  I do like to listen to my books while I drive, so that aspect is better than my car's regular bluetooth.  All in all, I think the device is just OK.  I think I need more training to learn exactly which words I need to say to get the response I am looking for.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0

Well... I'm glad it was a gift and not something I spent my money on.  Picture this.  You and your friend go for a drive.  You want to talk to your friend but instead you bring along one of your kids that you actually talk towho then relays what you said to your friend even though your friend is right there and can easily hear everything you're saying.

"Not really sure what all the complaints are about.  Following instructions isn't difficult. I got this product after I asked to be invited so I've had it since then beginning of summer.  Set up was seamless and simple. Plug in and open Alexa on my phone and add the device.  No problems.  I have a 2010 Ford Edge with Bluetooth.  Echo Auto can tell me where I am when I ask, ""Alexa, where am I?"" Integration with the app is fine. I have it set up to use WAZE navigation so that when I ask for directions, it opens up WAZE directions on my phone.  Playing music from Spotify is also easy. Asking questions like I do from my Echo Dot is the same.  It attaches well to my dashboard and stays put. I like that I can remove it to ""hide"" it when I leave the vehicle.What I would love to ditch is the USB cord but it needs power so there's no fix for that unless Amazon designs one that is more portable and can charge like a phone. Occasionally, Echo Auto will lose connection but it doesn't take long to get back online.  Playing games on this is fun for road trips too. Just load up the Skills and Games from the app. I'm satisfied with my purchase overall.",4,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
Small size. The included stand for it is really nice. Microphones really do hear you through pretty much anything. I play music with it via Apple Music and it works flawlessly as well as iHeart Radio.At least half the time I have to unplug it and redo it just to get it to tell me the news.

I had issues with the purchase because Amazon was charging me $25 for the useless vent holder and the website wouldn't allow me to purchase w/o the vent holder.

Plus it regularly lost the Bluetooth connection. I was having to unplug and then replug it several times per drive to reset it. I was so disappointed with the whole thing and ended up sending it back. It doesn't seem like it was entirely ready to be released and they still have a lot of tweaking to do on it.

"We’ve had the Echo Auto a few weeks now and it’s been a mostly positive experience. It makes it easy to play podcasts and music or stream audio while driving and it also integrated seamlessly with our “smart” garage opener.Complaints are minor but worth noting for others to make an educated decision on buying. Volume is still easier and sometimes necessary to adjust using the car controls, so don’t think the Echo will make things completely hands free. Occasionally Alexa doesn’t understand what you’re saying, sometimes due to engine/road noise and sometimes because you need to word things a very particular way. The latter is more generally true but we’ve found we want to do new things with the Echo Auto that we don’t ordinarily so there’s a learning curve, which can be particularly awkward/frustrating when driving. Probably the biggest issue in terms of inconvenience we’ve run into is when multiple phones are in the car that run with Alexa the Echo somewhat arbitrarily connects with one, which can lead to some frustration/ fiddling if particular music or other files are on the other phone.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0

I have a speech impairment where I only speak about 80 words a minute, and the average person speaks between 120 and 180 per minute.

It plays the tone at both ends of a request and cannot be changed.

"I use Alexa for everything in my home, especially music. So when they made one for the car, I was excited. It is easy to set up. It's small, and has a nice design to it. You can tell when it's accepting a command by the blue line / light that turns on. It comes with a sticky surface pad to keep it in place, but the glue on this pad isn't great and didn't work on my vehicle for long. Now keep in mind, I live in south Texas, and it is super hot most of the time. When I started to use this device it was in excess of 110 degrees over here. Imagine how hot the inside of my vehicle was. So, that being said, the glue didn't stand a chance. While on the topic of temperature, the manual clearly says not to leave it in your vehicle. This is definitely something I didn't like, so I didn't listen and would leave it in my vehicle. Some days, it was so hot in there that the device wouldn't even turn on. Other days, it worked like a charm. After all those days in the heat though, to this day it still works. Usually if it is unresponsive one day, it will usually start working in a few hours. Now, for the main issue. It doesn't always seem to work. I would estimate that it does work for me about 75% of the time. More so recently now that the days are cooler, it is working fine. Thing is there are far too many variables to determine what the main issue really is. It works more like the middle man and not as a single unit. It connects to your phone and your vehicle at the same time. So when it doesn't work, is it your phone? Is it your vehicle? Is it the temperature inside the vehicle? Is it a recent update on any one of those devices? Maybe it's because my phone is also connected to my smartwatch, or my sons tablet. Maybe it's because I was just in my wifi zone outside of my house, and now I am not. Way too many variables for me to wrack my brain with. All I know is that when it is working, I love it. I love Alexa in my house and use it all the time. So this is definitely a win for me. If they can just make it to work it works 100% of the time it would be perfect. With the new voices coming out too, like Samuel Jackson, this would be so awesome. Imagine if they do the voice of ""Kit"" (William Daniels) from Knight Rider and let you change the color of the light (red). Your welcome for the idea Amazon. I did get this product in the testing period when it was half the price (24.99) I think, which made the value great. Right now at the current price, I don't think I would buy it. $35 tops is what I would pay for it currently. Either way, not considering price, I do recommend this product.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"After waiting for a very long time to finally get my hands on an echo Auto, I was very excited waiting for it to arrived. I unboxed it and took it out to my 96 Suburban 2 try and install it. A vehicle that old does not have Bluetooth and I had to use a cassette adapter I already owned to plug into the earphone jack on the auto. Getting it set up was a bit tricky because some things in the guided setup weren't quite clear. eventually I got it to connect to both my phone and also play music out of the stereo the phone calls would go to another Bluetooth device connected to my phone to keep the calls private. Once it was installed it made listening to Spotify or Amazon music very easy.  navigation is a breeze, it actually opens up Google maps on your phone and shows you how to navigate to your destination.The skills it comes with, still need work though. Playing 20 questions you can always win if you pick a penguin. The escape room program is tedious, it would never let us actually use any of our inventory items. We tried playing mad libs, it kept asking us for all the planks, and as soon as we finished the list it would start another madlibs but never read us the story we started.

"First, let me say this is the first time I have given an Amazon Echo device such a low rating. There are three reasons for this. Reason number one is that the vent mount does not work. I checked the compatibility with the vents in my 2015 Honda and it was OK by the list provided before purchase. However I found every time I hit a speed bump or pot hole it would slide out. The second problem is that the part that allows you to wind up loose cord falls off. I discovered it is glued to the main piece (see photo). I should note that the temperature in the car was probably about 90 degrees in the late summer sun but I can only imagine what would have happened if I had turned on the heater during the winter months. Not good since it is mounted on the vent.So on to reason number three...The Echo Auto. I should point out that it is very important to establish your home and other destinations in your Alexa app. These are important steps for navigation. Setting up was really easy using the Alexa app. You should also do the voice profile. I would recommend this with the engine of your vehicle running to account for background noise.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,0,1
"I really wanted to love Echo Auto and I played around with it for a few weeks but in the end, I don't even like it. I made sure it was installed in the vent, I made sure my iPhone xs max was updated, and I made sure my Alexa app was updated. Tried connected to via bluetooth and 3.5 aux but the responsiveness is TOO SLOW. Echo Auto is much slower and clunkier than Echo in my home. When saying, ""Alexa"", there is a huge delay where the blue light lights up but I don't hear the chime for at least 5-7 seconds after. This is frustrating since i'm used to just talking to any of my Echos in the house without delay. Most of the time Echo Auto is inaccurate and I find myself raising my voice much louder to communicate. In case you're wondering, yes, I have the windows up and the AC off or on low when using it. I've been wondering if others are having these problems as well. I hope with time these issues are resolved. I really like the idea of Alexa in my car but for now it's not working like I'd like it to so I stopped using it.***UPDATE***",1,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"My insurance company thought this thing would be helpful so they made it available at no charge. That said, it's worth a bit less than I paid for it. Seriously, a Cinnabon gift card would have done more for me. So it has a speaker but refuses to talk unless I'm plugged into the audio input of my car. Really? You gave it a speaker then told it only to communicate via a cable. Oh and just one of two cables strewn through my car. I remember crap from Radio Shack that was this way.So connect it to power and then to audio input then begin downloading and training the thing so that after time it will be a half-vast version of my phone which can do a lot more and I can use it anywhere. No, I don't think so. This really reminds me of the new electronic license plates which are an expensive solution looking for a problem. Sorry, Amazon.

"Bottom Line:  Why do we need this product?  First of all; this product relies primarily on a high speed data connection.  If you are traveling on an Interstate Highway, and your phone doesn’t have a substantial data connection, it is useless.  You get a “sorry, I can’t do that right now”.  Or maybe no response at all, which is even more frustrating.  Secondly; you are solely relying on your Alexa Skills.  If this device could control Android/IPhone apps, it would be somewhat useful.  I tried listening to my phone’s music or preloaded podcasts.  There was no way for the Alexa Auto device to do this.  It tried getting music off of prime or podcasts from Tunein.  Without high speed data this failed to work and I was met with silence.  Lastly, the Google Assistant or even the Alexa phone apps works better without adding another piece of hardware to my car.  I can control apps on the phone and Google allows me not to have to pay attention to the phone.I am all in on the Alexa environment.  I think it is very useful.

I called Amazon and they stayed on the phone with me for over an hour until it was working. Once it was set up it worked just fine and has continued to do so to this day. It goes thru your phone so the response times aren’t as crisp as the in-home devices. Otherwise, it works just like the in-home echos. I use it primarily for music, but I also use it to answer random questions, get the weather, add reminders that I think of while driving, add items to lists, etc. One feature I like is being able to use is to turn lights on or off when I’m close to home. I can also have it start playing music in the house as I’m driving up. In short, it integrates with my in-home devices and does everything other echo devices do. I have it mounted on an air conditioning vent and I leave it plugged into a cigarette lighter outlet. My phone and car stereo automatically connect when I get in the car. I’m very happy with it and highly recommend it.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0

While driving through different cities radio signals get crossed and all of a sudden Taylor Swift turns into a mix of pop and talk radio with some and a hint of static to make it completely unbearable.

Why why why would I want my phone to be the dependent item every time I get in the car. And why would anyone want it forcing a switchover to steal my phone conversations, whenever I start the engine, from my Bluetooth earpiece or airpods. I know I can solve this with the AirPods by just removing and replacing them in the ear. But I get in and out a lot and sometimes it’s hung up the Bluetooth connection to my phone. Hence why we need like a power switcher to reset it right on top of the unit or a work around may be in the power cord that feeds it. Why not design a lithium battery backup case and these would be the bomb! Rechargeable directly while attached to the mounting station.

It's been a disappointing experience and today, I finally unplugged it from my car tossed it into my center console!  Firstly, it requires the presence of my smartphone in the car to even function because it uses the Alexa app on my phone.  If I don't happen to have my cell phone in the car, well, the unit is useless.  It also loses connection with my phone on a regular basis forcing me to unplug it from my charger and and replug it to ""restart"" it.  There is often a delay in response and in carrying out a command so my kids keep repeating a command and it just causes irritation all the way around.

However it constantly loses connection and tells you to reopen your Alexa app while you are driving.  it's been sitting in my armrest compartment for about six months. I don't consider even trying to get it to work anymore. Plus the vent holder they are including now i had to buy separately at the time because they wanted you to mount it with a sticky magnet on your dash, just brilliant. Since I go out of town and use rentals i knew that was a poor idea. So i bought the mount and just like one of the photos show, the cord holder came unglued and I lost it. I saw a few weeks ago that an insurance company is giving them away. Wonder how many accidents the echo will cause by people driving and trying to reopen the app?

Aside for the obvious reliance on your cell phones connection to the internet and the cars connection to the cell phone there really isn't much use for this.So you need cell phone with the alexa app.  OK let's just say I have a iPhone (Which I do) and the app is on it.  If I am using this thing and it is eating up my data one would assume that I have unlimited data.  So I have unlimited data (If not you're going to be sorry). That means that my phone already does everything this thing does and more.  I guess if you REALLY need to order something while driving then maybe?  Of crap I forgot the turn the lights off on the front porch.  Tell Alexa to turn off the lights OR when you stop use the app on the phone that Alexa has to be connected to.  Need directions and don't have a GPS.  Then use Waze, Apple Maps, or Google Maps to name the freebies and buy a dash mount for your phone.",1,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
Big fail on not letting us use the internal speaker to talk back and forth with Alexa.Why put a speaker in it and the only thing it does is tell you to hook it up through your car radio.,1,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
It has been a bit of a roller coaster for me.  My car has navigation and hands free and I had it set up to play pod casts with my iPhone.  It took several tries for my Bluetooth to be connected to the correct input.  I'm sure it was user error.  I walked away a few times but finally got it working.  I lost the connection once when my nav system was running along with Alexa navigation but most people won't be running both at the same time.  I just wanted to compare the two.  We had some difficulty getting Alexa to hear while running - i.e. playing music and you say STOP but it can't hear you.  We had to turn volume down and say STOP then turn volume back up.  We also got into a loop trying to play a game which was frustrating.  It seemed it wasn't hearing our answer appropriately if at all.  Maybe with practice we will work out the rhythm and fix that.  But on a longer trip it did provide a good source of entertainment and I love being able to ask for the closest gas station or fast food and get directions.  It works better if 2 people are in the car as you sometimes need to push response on your smart phone.  So it's not perfect but good enough that now my husband wants me to get another one for his car.,4,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I was so excited to get an Echo Auto, but overall I have been disappointed by it.-Even when I'm in the house and my car is off, when I open the Alexa app on my phone, it thinks I'm in the car and makes me tap a button that says ""I'm a passenger"" before I can use the app.",2,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
"The echo auto is pretty much a nice way of taking alexa on the go. What is great about it is that I am able to connect it to my account and basically all the stuff I need to remember on the drive home will be available for me when I get home. The installation is pretty simple and the stand is a definite must for me when you using this device. The stand fits into your air vent and does have cable management features to make it easier to feed your cables in a line down. The stand holds echo auto into place via magnets. It also uses a micro USB cable to power the device. It does come with a car charger as well but I normally just use my fast charging car charger because I also plug the other USB port into my phone. Connect the device to your phone was a bit of challenge as you will need to have your car on and sometimes it does not connect the first one or two tries. Once I was able to connect to alexa it is pretty much less than two to three second reconnecting on my note 10. When changing phones, it can be a bit of a headache and from what I can tell you can only connect to one phone at a time. This also does come with an auxiliary cable and you must plug this into your car in order to get sound at least for me. The reason being my car does not come with bluetooth capability. The sound quality on the aux port varies based on the car. This pretty much can turn your older cars into a bit of a smart car where you are able to make calls through alexa and the best part for me is being able to ask it to note things down. If I happen to need to remind myself to get something when I am at home, I can easily add a reminder and it will sync it to my other alexa devices. This does take up data however as it utilizes your phone to connect to the net. From what I can tell, it does not take up a ton of data. I saw maybe an additional 100 MB a month of usage on my data plan when I got the echo auto but again it depends on how much you use the echo auto. It allows you to transmit sounds through it so if you want to play your music you do not have to unplug the auxilary cable from it to plug into your phone. This works out great because i recently upgraded my phone to a phone that does not have a 3.5 headphone jack. Overall the echo auto is great. It give you all the notification from amazon as well as the ability to ask simple questions on your drive such as traffic and weather. It is a great way to give your car a bit of life and more hands free ability with your phone.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I love Amazon products and services.  I buy a lot from Amazon and have multiple Fire and Echo products.  I really wanted to love this product but I just couldn't.  Alexa on Echo works great at home, but Auto is just awful.  First, it can't control the phone as well as Google or Siri.  It caused all kinds of havoc with my phone which seems odd since it's an Amazon-branded phone (LG V35, bought from Amazon) preloaded with Amazon apps.  The first thing that happened when I played music, the music player appears in the notification list.  OK, they all do that.  BUT when you stop playing, you can't swipe it off the Notification list or close it at all.  Even killing Amazon Music won't get rid of the Amazon Music notification entry.  It's badly ""stuck"".  After a lot of process-killing, and trial-and-error, I found only 2 choices: reboot the phone or uninstall Alexa entirely from the phone and de-couple Auto.  Once I eliminated Auto, Amazon Music went back to its normal behavior and worked fine again.Alexa on the phone isn't too bad without the Auto, but I was hoping the Auto would improve Alexa's voice recognition because of the Auto's microphone ""array"".  Unfortunately, I never could really test it adequately because of all the other issues with this device.  It caused way more problems that it solved.  I returned to Google because it integrates with the phone better than Alexa (with or without Auto).",1,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I just wanted to be able to add things to my grocery or To Do lists hands free. I also liked the thought of accessing my Audible account hands free. I foolishly thought because I have had no problem pairing my phone in any car and never had  major set up issues with Alexa that I could have achieved this. WRONG!After an hour of not connecting, in which time Amazon had asked me to grant total access all the time to Alexa on my phone-it was still not working.  It was still  not working when a little animated video appeared and told me that every time I got in the car I would have to set my radio to the AUX, adjust the sound,  and wake Alexa etc (what?? - don't even want to think about Alexa when I get in my car).  On top of never achieving a true connection, I realized I didn't want to reset-everything in the car. Somehow I thought I could use it with my Sirius Radio and Uconnect.  Not working and I now don't like how it would operate when it does work.  I have a little notebook in my car for reminders and my phone does everything else really well-back it goes.

"I received this through my car insurance company. I was excited to try it and see if it made any major difference in my commute. About 4 hours every weekday is my commute time to and from work....needless to add obviously I listen to alot of music, do audibles and etc. I already had bluetooth in my car so I didn't think this Alexa device was really going to make my commute that much better. Overall its been somewhat better. I enjoy the games....yes I play games because I am usually in bumper to bumper traffic not moving on the freeway. Song Quiz is fun, Alexa plays a part of a song and I have to guess the title and artist. You can have multiple players in the game or just play with random other players around the globe. If a song is in my head I just have Alexa play the song. There will be occasional times you are misheard or your connection is lossed so heads up to that headache. I also dislike when I ask for a specific song to be played she keeps sending me to ""stations"" that are similar to the song I asked for.....I JUST WANT THE SONG DAMN IT!! Whooo....yeah that drives me nuts.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"Works well. Has minor issues like any other device. They are acceptable though and easily remedied. The issues could be on either my phone’s end or radio not necessarily the echo itself. This device though is nothing more than a translator of sort that hooks up your phone to your car stereo unit. It basically allows you to use your Alexa app hands free with its built in microphones. When the echo hears the wake word it sends a signal to the app to wake Alexa. Echo auto works best when your phone is plugged into your stereo unit via USB.All that being said, the unit works very well for what it is and the microphones used in the echo auto are very good. If I use the echo auto to make or receive phone calls, I am told my sound quality is way better than when I either answer or make a call through the radio. I love the fact that I can control my smart home devices by talking to Alexa in my car just like I would sitting at home. I can drop in only any device in my home from my car.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

"After having read so many reviews, I was anxious about how the auto would connect to my car specifically.  I have bluetooth through my car for my phone, but not for audio.  I didn't need to be worried though.  I was so impressed at how easily everything set up.  I plugged the chord into the aux cable and the cigarette lighter for power.  The app asked if my car had bluetooth for my audio.  I said no.  Then it asked if my car had bluetooth for phone use.  I said yes.  Now, when I get in the car, I just plug in the cigarette lighter and it works great.  My phone calls come through just fine.  Now, I can access my Amazon Unlimited Music so easily (previously I couldn't use it because it required me to manipulate my phone while driving, which I didn't do).  My only complaint is that  throughout my commute, Alexa sometimes loses connection.  This may be because of gaps in my data coverage, but it isn't always consistent where it  happens.  Also, sometimes I'll get crackling in the audio.  This may also be a data coverage issue.  The vent-magnetic holder works great.  I like that much better than the stick-on version used previously.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"Okay. So I have had this for a few months. Overall, with a solid internet connection and a quiet car, Alexa works pretty well playing music, from Amazon. And the flash briefing. And it can add things to my grocery lists while I am driving- big plus. But it is abysmal for getting itself started and connected. I think it is connected to the home WiFi in the driveway when I start the car and hiccups attempting to change connection to my cell providers network. I am at least a half mile to mile on my journey before it will connect. But you have to keep asking and hearing sorry I can’t connect right now until it will finally answer as there is no way to know that it has. Also, for the smart home stuff that I really want it to do - open and close garage door and unlock front door - it will not do that. Even if I am sitting in my driveway and connected to my home WiFi. I understand security concerns but you have to use a code in the house so why won’t that work with this device- especially when I am on my home WiFi. I would never use this to navigate to anywhere - although it is pretty good at reporting business hours IF I know the exact name of the business. The whole “open app” thing to get things accomplished - you have to unlock your phone, etc... that really needs improvement if this is going to be a truly hands free device. Of course I understand Amazon must work with a million different cell phone manufacturers and cell service providers to deliver a truly seamless experience - but with each offering its over version of “hands-free” services, I am sure they are in no rush to help improve Amazon’s product. So I get the whole Alexa app having to handle the majority of the heavy lifting. But it does make for a less than ideal Alexa experience.",3,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
Here's a list of random issues I've experienced (they happen a few times a week):- The audio cuts out for a split second every few minutes.,2,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"I love using Alexa at home and have Echo's in most rooms, so I was eager to try it in my car.  It is certainly okay, but I'm not as thrilled for app-related reasons.  First, to use my phone's data plan it needs to activate the Alexa app in my phone, but it currently isn't doing that without my pressing a button claiming I'm a Passenger rather than the driver, even if the car is parked.  Secondly, when I ask for weather it can't figure out where it is, insisting I should set my phone to allow the Alexa app access to my location data at all times rather than my preference of allowing that only when the Amazon Alexa app is running.  When it backpedals to asking me for a city to look up instead it seems unable to recognize anything but a large city rather than suburban towns.Also, the mounting hardware obstructs my heating vent.  I allow my phone to do that but I don't want more than one out front like that, and Alexa's hearing is so good it really doesn't need to be there, too.  They should have provided some way to apply it elsewhere with, say, double-sided sticky tape or something.",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
Its more pain than its worth. You have to open the app every time you get in the car in order for it to connect. It cant hear you over the softest music. I have gone back to android auto...basically a glorified dashboard ornament at this point.*Update*,3,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"I jumped on the waiting list for this as soon as I heard about it.  Then, I waited and waited some more.  It finally arrived.  I love having Echo in my car.  The echo auto is pretty tiny and very lightweight.  It has opened up a whole new avenue for hands free entertainment.  It isn't perfect though.The setup process could work better.  I had to factory reset the device before it would work the first time, and then had to do the same after getting a new phone in order to get it to reconnect.  Take it from me...that line about ""It may take a few minutes to locate your device"" is a load of crap.  Somewhere in Amazon's tech department is a guy giggling over all the people sitting and waiting.  If your device doesn't immediately show up when you hit that part of the process, cancel the setup, factory reset, and do it again.  The first thing that got me was the fact that you can't change the name it goes by.  I don't call my home units ""Alexa"" so I usually have to repeat myself after remembering the auto unit only goes by that name.  The other two things I don't care for are the fact that it doesn't hear me when the air conditioner is on high.  It is a lot of loud wind noise, so I get that.  Still, I wish it heard me.  Lastly, I wish there where other mounting options.  I don't like having it on my vent.  That position leaves it directly in the sun all day, and right in the middle of that wind storm when the car first turns on.  It also leaves it right there in plan view just screaming, ""Look...a new toy for you to steal.""  I'd much rather have a cup holder mount or a way to mount it on the visor.  For now, it just hangs out in my cup holder.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I think that it is a good idea to make Alexa available in the car.  As in the house, Alexa outperforms Siri for responsiveness and ease in getting my point across.This early implementation is a little buggy, and some features still need to be built out.  In terms of bugs, it never responds to the first voice command, for example.  Before asking it to do something that I need, the first command of the day is always lost, so I allow for that by asking for something innocuous.  I usually start by asking for the time of day.  This flushed out another bug: Although Alexa knew what city we are in and what time zone, it consistently reported the time as being two hours later than it really was.  Happily, that bug was fixed this week and it now reports the correct time.  I’ve asked it to listen to messages and send them, which it appears to do, but the messages are never delivered anywhere.",3,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"I was able to purchase this on the pre-sale $25 promotion, and I'm a fan! It took a little while to get it (I was waiting on the invitation awhile), but once I did it was a pretty easy set up and I was on my way. My jeep has bluetooth for calling, but not music. So this allows me to charge my phone and also stream whatever I want through my speakers handsfree. Honestly, that's enough for me. To everyone that's saying it's ""bulky"" I say, ""where?"" Seriously, if you ever lived when you had to mount a GPS to your dashboard, you'll appreciate how small this actually is. I have mine mounted to the defroster vents and it keeps it even more out of my way. If you're ever nervous that she's ""listening"" to you, all you have to do is mute her. I also love the ease of telling her to turn on smart-home objects. My one complaint is that it took her a minute to update when I first got it, but once I muted her for 30 minutes and un-muted she updated and worked fine. I also wish I didn't have to open the prompt on my phone to get directions, but it still beats googling them myself. Overall, worth the purchase.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"I have two Echo Dots at home which I love and make a lot of use of and loved the idea of having Alexa in my car.  The problem is with the Echo Auto's ability, or lack thereof, to connect with my iPhone.  It usually requires at least one disconnect/reconnect from the power adapter before it establishes a solid connection with my phone.  Having the Alexa app open beforehand speeds the process up somewhat.  Once it connects it can then access the internet and for the most part remains connected at which point I can stop screaming at Alexa and all is good.My other complaint is that I have to switch over to my Bluetooth connection on my car's stereo in order to interact with Alexa despite the fact that I can wake Alexa while in FM mode (I see the blue light come on as if waiting for a command) but it isn't possible to get a response without switching over to the Bluetooth input via the selector on my car's stereo system.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"I like the Echo Auto. It worked fine in my 2015 Ford truck, but my wife had a number of issues with it staying connected to her Samsung S9 cell phone and her 2016 Jeep. I mainly got it for her as a the Jeep internal system did not work the well when trying to make cell calls. The Ford truck's internal system works good and never had a problem. So, I really did not need it for that. I thought using this would work instead of her Jeep internal system for cell calls, but it would not stay connected. Also the volume of the Echo Auto is very low, even in my truck I had to turn it up a lot to hear it. I also do not like that fact that you can not listen to another music source like XM Radio, CD, or USB drive while wanting to also use the Echo Auto. The Echo Auto has to be set up to be you current audio source. If not, you can not hear any calls though your speaker system. It is a good idea, but I can not see that it would be as good as a current vehicle internal system. I can see it being used it you do not have a Bluetooth hook up in your vehicle, but you will have to have a 3.5mm audio jack input for your audio system. In older vehicles, before the integrated nav systems, it would be good, but any newer vehicle with the internal system, this would be more of a step back.",3,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

"I think I am in the minority on this product. I was so honored to be able to get to preview this item, and I could not wait to write a review. I had a little difficulty setting it up, but it was because I had never been able to do it before so it was a new experience. At times Alexa has difficulty understanding my Southern accent, and my one criticism is the fact that I have to find out how to connect each program like Sticher or Spotify, but I am sure I can get that after a phone call. At first I had difficulty getting it to play over the car speakers, but suddenly it started playing, and yesterday it would not connect for no reason at all, but then did but did not play over the stereo. But, why am I giving it such a high review? I may take it down a star from a five star review due to the reasons I just said, but overall this is an amazing product! I can keep my eyes on the road and not have to touch my phone on my hour long commute to work and hour long back. That is amazing. I was listening to a podcast and paused it to ask who they were talking about, she told me, and then I was able to get back to the podcast. I am blown away. Yes, there are bugs, and when it improves I would love to be able to preview that one as well. I am honored to have this opportunity, and trust me, this is an honest review.

"Twenty years ago I was a busy working mom with two little kids, and boy, did I need this Echo Auto.  About the only quiet time I had (as long as the kids were sleeping) was in the car.  I would go through my list of things I needed to do, call about, buy, etc.  And would often think, ""If only I had a tape recorder in my car that would start up when I started driving.  I could tell it what I needed to remember.""  (Tape recorder, for those too young to remember, was a little cassette device you could record sounds with and then play them back.  But I digress.)  The Echo Auto does everything I wish I had 20 years ago.  I tell her what needs to go on my shopping list, what needs to go on my To Do list, and anything else I need to remember.  She also plays anything I want to hear, and whenever I need to find something nearby, she tells me where to go.  This is a MUST for every busy mom.  All you need to do is talk and she is there to listen and help.  I've already bought a couple more of these as gifts for my two, busy working mom daughters.

So in essence if I ever get into my car and ask Alexa to do something such as continue my book or play music It always says it's having trouble connecting. So I've gotten used to driving from about a minute or so before I ask Alexa for anything because I know it wouldn't work anyway. It's not deal breaking but it's really annoying.

I can really understand this, since I've given a bad review on my original echo because of how much of a hard time set up was for it.

I don’t have a half hour to configure, setup and troubleshoot every time I get in the vehicle. If it’s plugged in and Bluetooth connected it should work. Don’t throw it in the woods because later you’ll want to find it and drive over it repeatedly. Update: I finally got it working, after about three hours of effort. But the next morning I get in the car and Alexa tells me she “can’t connect to the Alexa app.” The photo is the Alexa app screen I get. No “continue”, “back”, “close” or any other button I can use to get out of this screen. JUST A FROZEN SCREEN. I’m not sure what all I did but I have both working in two vehicles and we like them very much. Once you get it installed properly and use the same routine with it, it works consistently and reliably.Update after two weeks: I now have two Echoes working, in a 2020 Jeep Gladiator and a 2013 Fiat Barth. I simplified the install by connecting iPhone via AUX, so my only challenge is establishing, maintaining and re-establishing Bluetooth betw phone and Echo. This works, although if I simply turn off and exit the vehicle, then try to open Alexa (to work with shopping lists, etc) I get the frozen screen shown in the attached pic and have to restart phone to get rid of it. Then when I re-enter vehicle Bluetooth does not re-establish automatically, I have to go thru “Add A Device” routine, with all the dumbed-down steps (“Have you attached Echo To The Air Vent?”) to restart it. 4-5 minutes. There is no problem as long as I shut down before turning off the car, it restarts fine, but it’s hard to remember, as this is the only input that requires this procedure. I will learn, but my wife will never do this, she will toss it. Two minor, non-Alexa problems are that my AUX connection (vs 12V ) doesn’t fully charge my phone, on a long Drive it discharges. Also, the Input default is SAT radio, so I have to remember to change to AUX. I’m getting there, but this is a caution to those who would buy assuming it’s Plug & Play. It ain’t.",4,1,2019-10-19,1,0,1
"I was truly looking forward to getting the Echo Auto, and was like a kid at Christmas time when it finally arrived. But all the excitement ended when I plugged it into my car and tried to use it.I have had it for many months now, and it is nothing more than a sad novelty. The overwhelming majority of the times I try to use it, it lets me know it is having difficulty connecting to my device, and that I should try again later.",2,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0

"Pretty underwhelmed by this product. I really wanted to love it, but I can’t. Initially, I was excited to be able to play music or navigate somewhere hands free by just asking Alexa.. but it doesn’t quite work that way. Often times, a simple, “play (insert artist name here)” or “navigate to gas station” would just offer a confused ding afterward instead of actually following through. It also would randomly detect that I wanted its attention when I didn’t, and would chime in out of nowhere.Despite the fact that this device just doesn’t deliver technologically, it also has an extremely cumbersome CORD that has to be plugged into your car somewhere. I’m not a fan of exposed wires or cords of any kind; and what’s worse, is the little crosshair piece on the mount that’s meant to sort of control the cord fell off the first day!",2,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"We have a lot of things that Alexa can control in our house.  Cameras, water heater, garage door, all door locks, lights, fans, alarms, thermostats, etc.  Now I can adjust the AC, open the garage door, turn on the lights, and listen to all my stations while still in the car.  Set reminders, drop in to ask the spousal unit what she sent me to the store for in the first place.  I really use this much more than I ever thought I would.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,2,0
"Since my car has Bluetooth, a GPS/directions, hands-free calling and other apps to find weather, gas, dining, etc, I wondered what Alexa could bring to the party. But, for $25, I gave it a try. Installing the hardware was straight forward, although the device that attaches to the vent leaves the Alexa somewhat wobbly. The vent in my car has vertical louvers that are slanted just a tad. Therefore, Alexa sits on the holder at an angle. When I move the vent to direct the a/c or heat in a different direction, Alexa turns with it. Not a problem, but not well thought out either. There is a small rubber device that sticks to the mounting plate to hold the wires, but after one day in the sun, the glue melted and the darn thing doesn't stick anymore.The instructions for setting up Alexa and connecting to my smart phone are weak. Not much there and it took me several tries to get it working. But work it did and streaming from my playlists in my driveway on Amazon Prime Music was good. Until the next day. Alexa kept telling me that she couldn't connect to the network. Very frustrating. After uninstalling and reinstalling several times, and with absolutely no help from the help/support at Alexa, I got it to work, until about a half hour into my trip when Alexa informed me that the network connection was lost. No music from Alexa for the next two hours, so I just streamed from my phone. Again wondering just what the benefit of Alexa is.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"There must have been a contest at Amazon for different teams to develop Alexa gadgets. Then the  ""Alexa Auto"" team must have gone golfing until the day before it was due and this is the result.  The vent mount is literal garbage and cost $10…really? I sent it back. It is made of thin plastic and is a poor design in general (clearly the minimal amount of effort put into it).I don’t get the 3’ power cord and I don’t get why it had to stick out the side…apparently the electronics industry has not developed any better plug, like a 90 degree  or maybe even a 180 (oh, wait..they have).  I have a fairly new car with bluetooth and it has serious struggles staying connected.  I’m not clear on why, but the connectivity has improved since I first setting it up.  I’m hoping that the ignorant notification tones will soon be stopped with a firmware update, as I don’t need all the notification chimes while sitting in my car…just do as I ask and that will be the notification.",2,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
I bought this on sale at Best Buy thinking this would be nice to use when I drive on a trip or the drive to our lake home etc. It is really slow at intergrating with cellphone and the cellphone must be in a spot where it can get a good signal from it. Also when you ask Alexa something it seems to really lag and only about half of what she says comes over the car speaker. Plays music just fine and sounds great running through my car radio and speakers.The mount for it that comes in the box is absolute junk. It is supposed to mount on your vent well it doesn't hold worth a darn. I put velcro on my dash and on the echo bottom and that way I can just pop it off when I want to store it.Would I buy another one.....nope. I have 2 echo dots and there are great and recognize my voice from 6 feet away. I am constantly yelling at this thing to do something and it just seems to sit there. I am tech savy and almost 74 but I know what I am doing.  Amazon better beef this up and nobody is going to buy anymore. I would not recommend it to anyone due to nature of the interaction of it not working well.,2,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
"I bought the Echo Auto about 10 days ago (as of Oct. 30, 2019.) I mainly purchased it to use as a hands free device. I already have several Alexa enabled devices in my home so I was excited when the opportunity came up to purchase one for the car. I have not been too disappointed. Many people have said they either can't make calls or receive calls. I haven't had trouble doing either, and i am running it from an I phone 6. Plus I can use many of the features as with a regular Echo device for the home. I have also learned to stream music from Amazon Music, which I have learned to get used to, but I would love it if Amazon would create a skill for Alexa to play your own music from your phone. The other drawback I have found is that it sometimes takes the Echo Auto a little bit to connect to my phone once I'm in my vehicle, but I have found if you open the Alexa app before your Echo Auto turns on, it does connect a little faster.  Also the Cords seem a little bit cumbersome as the Echo Auto needs a constant source of power to operate as well as an Aux cable if your car isn't equipped with bluetooth.  I also think an issue some people were having (including me.) with not being able to get the Echo Auto to work is when you first get it, you need to update your Alexa app, as well as make sure your Echo Auto is updated as well. I did a Google search on how to update the Echo Auto and once I updated both, I had no issues with it working. I hope this review helps I know it's long, but I wanted to be honest about my experience with it. Most of all, just be patient with Amazon, This is a new product and there are still some bugs to work out and improvements to be made in time. So overall I'm not disappointed.",4,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

"First some background: I love tech and gadgets. Also, my car has an infotainment system with navigation, Bluetooth, and an auxiliary input. I mention this because in order to use the Echo Auto, you need to have either Bluetooth or auxiliary input already as there is no speaker with the Echo Auto. There is also no display either - and this is a problem.Echo Auto works through your cell phone - you need to have Alexa installed and set up on your phone. You may want to keep your phone charging as well - I tend to whether I need to or not. Echo Auto uses your phone's connection to the network to provide requested information.",3,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0

"I have several Alexa devices in my house so I was excited to try the Echo Auto in my car. Unfortunately my car doesn't have Bluetooth, so I had to buy a separate speaker that I could hard-wire to Alexa with the available analog/aux port. I ended up with USB power and analog audio cords everywhere; hardly the simple or discreet installation I expected. I also did not expect to have to start the Alexa app when I got in the car, though I guess that makes sense. Alexa herself worked fine; the voice recognition was accurate and as good as it is at home. Also, I could hear Alexa through the Echo Auto device speaker during setup. Why can't I just use that speaker?If it were possible to pair Echo Auto with ANY Bluetooth speaker I chose, instead of requiring that the car have Bluetooth or providing a speaker with a manual connection, I would try to use it. As it is, I have packed it back up, returned the external speaker, and I am considering selling my Alexa Auto on Ebay since I've missed my 30-day window to return it.

"The headline is what I get most of the time.  I can literally sit in my car for several minutes, asking Alexa to turn on a lamp's smart plug and she keeps saying she can't connect to the network.  What's worse is connecting to something like NPR News  and not being able to turn it off because Alexa can't connect to TURN IT OFF!  On the other hand, if I try listening to an Audible book, it will play for about a minute then just cut off.  I've got an Apple 7 and don't have problems with disconnects, so I don't think it's the phone.  I haven't contacted Amazon about it yet, but if they can't fix it, I'm not going to mess with it anymore.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"I've been excited about the Echo Auto since it was first announced, so I jumped on it as soon as I received the invitation. Because I was looking forward to it, I was worried that it would not meet my expectations, but I really love having it. It's a little cumbersome to set up at first, but once it is set up, it has worked nearly seamlessly (once early on, when my wife drove the car, it caused some connectivity issues that took some effort to resolve, but she has now connected her phone to it as well, so we have had no issues since). It works exactly as you'd expect it to work if you have any Alexa devices at home. I don't have an exceptionally quiet car, but the device has had no issue hearing me at any point, even when I'm driving on the freeway in the pouring rain. There's nothing really fancy about it, it's just a way to port an always-listening device to your phone to connect to your car's Bluetooth device (or reversed if you are using it to connect your phone via Bluetooth to your car's auxiliary port). There's not much more to say about it. If you prefer to use your phone's ""Hey Siri"" or ""OK Google"" capabilities, then you might not need this device. If you prefer to use Alexa (or, as in my case, you find that Siri often doesn't hear you unless you shout at it), then this is worth the cost. It's all about preferences, but this is one device that relatively flawlessly lets you integrate what might be your preferred voice assistant to your car's audio system.",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

This is a preliminary review as I'm still trying different ways to connect but so far.....I'm disappointed in myself for not reading the fine print when I pre-ordered Echo Auto.

"I see that there are a lot of bad reviews or so-so reviews of the Echo Auto but here's my personal take.  I got it from the invitation and it was half-price, so that was a plus from the start.  I wanted it mainly for two reasons--first, so I could arm and disarm my Ring alarm with my voice from the car, and second, so I could summon up Pandora and use my voice to skip or thumbs-up/thumbs-down a particular song.  It works perfectly for both.  As a gigantic bonus, I am able to keep it in a closed part of my center console that is made to hold a cell phone.  It actually has a lid on this area so the Echo is completely invisibe---yes it still hears me perfectly!  Not too shabby and much better than I ever expected.  Only con I have experienced is that sometimes it takes a few minutes to conncect you my phone....but that only happens once in a while.  And you also cannot change the wake word like you can with every other Echo device...I don't really understand why that is the case. But otherwise  I really do reccomend the Echo Auto, at least for the uses mentioned above.",4,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"I have been trying to figure out a way for Alexa to somehow work in my car. I kept thinking ""if only I had an Alexa in my car, it would  make my life so much easier'. I am always thinking of things to add to my shopping list, reminders, etc.  while I am driving. Now that I can do those things I am so much more organized. I can call my friends and family hands-free and can even do a drop in call from my Amazon Alexa auto echo to echo dots which are set up in different rooms in my house. I absolutely love it! I highly recommend it, especially to people who already think they cannot  live without their Amazon Alexa(s). Easy to install and use. Check your cars' compatability with the Amazon Auto Echo before you purchase just to make sure that it will work with your car. I have a 2012 Honda CRV.  I have to use an auxillary cord since my car is not currently set up for that. But it has not caused any problems with functionality of the product.

"Let me start by saying I love Alexa!  She has been such a great asset for me and my family.  Deciding to put her in the car was an easy one.  Yes, I could have just bluetoothed my phone and used the Alexa app, but when my phone goes to screen saver, it turns off the music.  It's much smaller than I imagined, only about 4"" long approximately, but this too is a good thing.  With the phone holder and dash cam already taking up space, it was nice to not have a bulky item added to it.  She sounds clear and strong when coming through the speakers in the car with a kind of tunnel sound at first, but that quickly disappears for the Alexa voice we all know.  I also like the magnetic hold that it has to the vent holder instead of a sticky pad.  The only draw back is the way the vent holder works.  It doesn't clip on, it pushes in.  The vent holder does fall off every once in a while which is a nuisance even tho it's all the way in. I wish they had found a better way to secure it to the vent, but that is the only thing I could possibly find wrong.  It is a great Alexa in a little package!

When I was selected to pick up this Echo, to replace the one I had in my truck already, I was thrilled! I went through the setup process, and immediately started listening to different music (Amazon based, as well as Sirius XM). It went really well! Then, I parked my truck and went inside the house. The next time I got in the truck the Echo wasn’t connected to my phone - So - unplug it and plug it back in. Solved. Then, the app was disconnected from the echo. Open the app, re-register, etc - Solved. Then, It couldn’t reach Sirius XM.... You can see where this is going....I have to do the power process almost every time I get in my truck. I have to reconnect Sirius to the Echo app about once a month. And, frankly, asking Alexa to play Sirius XM only works about half the time.",3,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I now have two of these, and most of my gripes have more to do with spotty cellular coverage than anything wrong with Alexa or the Echo Auto device. The first one of these I got didn't have much in the way of mounting or cable management, and this one is much better in that regard, which helps it to be a cleaner install in your car. The fidelity is surprisingly good, but some of that may be that I have a new car with a newer stereo setup. The only real issues I've had could be improved with more buffering on the back end to store the data longer inside the device so that when the cell signal cuts out the audio stream isn't interrupted. I figure implementing that would seriously add to the cost despite how cheap RAM is these days. Yes, you can use Alexa just through your phone without buying one of these, but the convenience and simplicity of operation make it worth the price to add one of these to your commute rather than fighting with your phone everyday / every time you want to utilize the Amazon voice assistant.",4,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"I got one of these super cheap and use it in the bedroom. You have to plug its sound output into a speaker system, which makes it limited for use in a car as your vehicle stereo has to have a signal input jack.

When you come back in range, there is a pop-up screen where you have to tell it you're a passenger!

She loses connection often (I have wifi and bluetooth in my 2015 vehicle and I'm using a Note 8)  it seems that the app on my phone must get ""tangled"" or confused by other apps using my stereo system and I will often have to unplug my Alexa and restart my phone to get them back in sync. I can't figure out what's causing it. But, when I use my car to make a phone call (pushing buttons on steering wheel) and then later ask Alexa to call someone, she just flashes and then nothing untill I restart everything again. Often while driving she'll just say that she lost connection. Because of how confident she loses connection, I don't feel confident enough to trust her for navigation purposes.

I do not have car play only Bluetooth. For a lack of better terms it piggybacks through my phone for service. I have had no issues with it connecting or losing connection. I have an iPhone but I would rather use Alexa instead of Siri. I can ask Alexa to play music, turn my lights on or off with my smart plugs which are already set up, tell her to add something to my shopping list or even tell me the weather.

"I'm generally enthusiastic about Amazon's hardware and the Alexa speakers. I bought this while it was on limited trial/beta and.... it is really bad. It's an unwieldy extra appliance to plug in and have knocking about your vehicle, and it requires a bluetooth connection to your phone, which in turn needs a bluetooth connection to your car. When it works, it's almost as convenient as merely enabling the Alexa voice assistance on your phone -- which means it's a step down from not having this product. There is absolutely no added value here. And that is the best case.Other problems are 1) it is not very good at hearing commands, 2) it seems slower than Alexa directly on the phone, which is already limited by the speed of a cell data connection, 3) if you've already got phone chargers in your car you may be running out of USB connections or have an abundance of wires, 4) occasionally it has trouble connecting to your cell phone.",1,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0

The installation was relatively easy, but I did have to install the latest IOS first, which is never headache-free.  I do not use  Amazon music, so the device would be limited to use for my various lists in Alexa, but valuable nonetheless, as thoughts pop into my  head while I'm driving.  I did try out some other skills that might be useful in the car, but came up with nothing noteworthy.This would be enough for me to keep the device, however it's just too glitchy.  As some other reviewers mentioned, the device frequently unsyncs with the app on my phone.  Sometimes it just doesn't work for some unknown reason.  The volume is definitely problematic, and really the main reason I will be sending mine back, as I cannot ""communicate"" with Alexa unless the volume is basically maxed out, but then everything else is way to loud.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0

Sometimes, Alexa has trouble understanding what you ask and, even though there is a strong phone signal, it simply says it has trouble connecting to the phone. The phone connection shows that Echo is actually connected. Could it be a fault of my Samsung S9 Plus?Then, when I manipulate the Alexa app as a passenger (and I am the passenger) I try to switch the songs or find the song or album I want to play in playlist, it simply won't do that, while when at home, when I want to direct my Echo dot from my phone, it works. I assume this option is locked when the Echo Car is connected, for maybe safety issues, but definitely, there should be a better way to allow the passenger to control this, instead of asking Alexa ""play .... "" and then it will do nothing or will play something else.",3,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
I wanted to like this device. My auto insurance company gave it to me. I linked it to my iPhone and set up with my car’s Bluetooth. The set up was simple and as directed. (At first)The echo auto was virtually useless. It did manage to play music from Spotify. It could  not read a text message or an email to me. It could not navigate me to a business or an address or home even!  It could not reliably place a phone call to people in my contact list.,1,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"I waited a couple of weeks to give a review because I wanted to use the Echo Auto as much as I could. I think this is a great idea and before I got this, my kids were so used to having an echo in the house that I’ve heard them call out “Alexa, play Top Pop” in my car only to realize they were in my car. We all got a kick out of that. Needless to say, I was excited to get the echo auto for my car. It is relatively easy to set up and only took a few minutes. I would say one of the first things you have used to is after you give the wake word, you have to wait for the audible beep. If you were used to the one in your house you do not have to wait for the audible beep. sometimes that can take a few seconds. I found myself saying the wake word and then immediately giving my request like I do with the in-home echos. I would hear the beep and realize I had to start over. I ended up having to do it over because I was so used to having an echo in my house and how those work. It’s been hard to get used to. The other issue I had with it is that it sometimes does not understand your request and it does not give an indication that you need to repeat what you said. The blue light comes on and turns off and then nothing happens. This is frustrating because you’re not sure if it’s processing your request or not. It also takes longer for your request to process. I don’t know if this is a factor of your cell phone coverage or its connection to Bluetooth. Another issue that I found was that when I would get into the car it wouldn’t recognize my device about 50% of the time. So I had to unplug it from the outlet and plug it back in for it to recognize my device. I love the concept but it doesn’t work nearly as well as the in-home echos.",3,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"For many with late-model cars that already support Bluetooth streaming and handsfree controls, much of what this offers is redundant. With certain older cars, this may be a lifesaver.I have a 2006 Volvo S40, which has no bluetooth integration. Despite having steering wheel controls for the radio, the skip forward/back and play/pause controls work only with the radio, not whatever may be on your phone. For my car and similar ones, this device offers a good way to control playback and have the convenience of Bluetooth in your car, with a few cool extras from Alexa. I have tried ""bluetooth remote"" type devices, but they generally are battery powered and auto-shutoff, making the delay between pressing pause and your media actually pausing incredibly long, as the device has to reconnect via bluetooth.",4,1,2020-6-11,1,0,1
"This is fun to have in the car, but it is pretty glitchy. We tried it out on a 2500 mile road trip and found its best for playing music. It’s super easy to ask it to play any song or genre you are in the mood to hear. Unfortunately sometimes it just stops playing a song in the middle or can’t figure out how to restart after am interrupting phone call or something similar.We tried playing games on it, but it seemed to have trouble hearing us or processing what we were saying. I even tried pulling it off the mount and holding it directly in front of my face while speaking very clearly. We couldn’t get through a game without it glitching and either starting over or doing the wrong thing which made 20 questions impossible. We had a good laugh, but we’re grateful we didn’t pay full price for our device.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0

"I waited for MONTHS for my invitation to be sent to me and when it was I was so excited. However, once received set up was a nightmare. I ended up giving up after awhile and going back to it the next day when I finally got it to connect. More often than not I get ""unable to connect"" and half the time when I ask it to play something, it plays something completely different than what I asked it and I can't help but wonder where in the world it came up with that from what I said. It disconnects a lot too. The part where the wires go on the stand has already separated from it- within days actually. I really, REALLY wanted to love this product because I love all my other Echo's for my house however this just doesn't make the mark.  Here's hoping they can improve this product for future buyers. When it does work, it plays well through my bluetooth set up on my car. But, as of right now....... my Echo Auto is just floating around my car somewhere because it hasn't been worth the headache. I won't give it one star because it really does have potential, but two is my limit.",2,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0

"Doesn't work nearly as well as Roav Viva. We had to wait on our invitation for this for so long we ended up getting a Roav Viva. It is great. We got a second for another car. Still super. Finally got this. More difficult to install and get set up, but got it working. But every time I try to use it, it isn't connected to Alexa and I have to open the app on my phone every time. I never have to do that with Roav. If I have to open the app every time I get in the car, I'm not going to use it much. Get a Roav.UPDATE 1",1,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"I wanted to have some real world usage before writing my review.  So after six months, I can say I am pretty happy with Echo Auto, especially since Apple Music is now included.  There were some growing pains initially, mainly with unstable connection with my iPhone at times and requiring repeating the set up twice.  However, after some automatic firmware updates, it is very stable now and connection is just about rock solid for the past several months.  I got this mainly because Tesla does not have Apple CarPlay, so having Echo Auto is the next best thing.  It's so nice to be able to use voice command to bring up SiriusXM, Apple Music, Deezer, etc and be able to turn on lights in the house as I'm getting home.  And the sound quality is excellent, just as good as streaming from my phone directly or by the car natively.  I also haven't experienced any cut out's whatsoever.  So after more than 6 months of use, I would definitely recommend it if your car has good Bluetooth and your wireless connection is strong.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0

"Overall I love this little device. I have used it in both a Ford Fiesta with Sync and a Dodge Grand Caravan with an aux cable. The initial setup was fairly easy and and I only had an issue where I needed to uninstall the Alexa app on my iphone when it was replaced. As it was not recognizing the device, even though it was listed as connected.After a week of testing it out with the Ford and Dodge without my wife aware I set it up one morning that we were all heading out. I turned on 91X and she was blown away.  After that moment it was clear that we will need two of these devices from now on.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"While it does say streaming and use of your phone plan, what I didn't get is that it won't work without using your data.  I don't have unlimited data...  I sincerely thought it would at least play the music downloaded to my phone or use downloaded google maps for navigation.  But, no!  It was a waste of money and time for me to try to use this.  I still had to use my phone for everything.  I have bluetooth connection in my car, so this did absolutely nothing for me.  Sad...  I had high hopes because I don't like using my phone while driving--I always pull off the road if I need to use it.  Maybe some day they will make this practical for those of us who don't have unlimited data!",2,1,2019-10-12,1,1,0
"I waited for months to be invited to purchase the Echo Auto.  I mean, who wouldn't want Alexa in your car doing all sorts of Alexa-related activities?  But, at least with this current version, there are some significant limitations that proved to be a deal-breaker for me.First off, you have to connect to the Echo Auto each time you get in your car...and that means that you car's sound system is held hostage by the Echo Auto.  In my case, I had to connect via Bluetooth to my Honda Accord's sound system, which means I could not listen to the radio (satellite or otherwise) without first disconnecting the Echo Auto.  My primary entertainment in the car is the SiriusXM radio, so now I had to choose between them...and flipping back and forth was a pain.  Sure, you can connect to SiriusXM through the Echo Auto, but that delivers noticeably inferior audio quality...and it eats up your cellular data.  Even if you have unlimited data available, you're burning through the data and getting an inferior experience in the process.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,1,0
"I got Alexa Auto by invite and at first I was ready to toss this thing out the window. There were connectivity issues in the beginning. I believe a lot of the issues were conflicts with the bluetooth connection between my phone and truck / Alexa. To give it a fair shake, I've been using this for months and now time for a review. The voice recognition is spot on for the most part even with a hillbilly accent like mine. Sound quality is great and making phone calls are a breeze. I like the fact that all I have to do is say ""Alexa"" call (whoever is in my contacts) and it will dial. True hands free.To run Alexa Auto, I have my phone plugged into the USB of the truck so the audio runs through it instead of bluetooth. This keeps my phone charged while streaming Alexa and is a lot louder than bluetooth. This solves 92.67% of the problems. Also, make sure you are using the latest build of the Alexa app. With a lot of patients, you can tweak the bugs out of Alexa Auto and have a real enjoyable experience.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"Well, hard to really write one. Got this in great time, was looking forward to it. Tried setting up with my phone, there was no 'echo auto' on my Alexa app, which was up to date. Tried my Ipad, yep that worked and had the Echo Auto selection. I dug deeper and found my Android had to be at 5.1, and I am at 5.0 and can't update to higher version. OMG, I have over 30 Alexa devices with my Echo Dots which all work fine. What was someone thinking not making these compatible like most other devices? Think of the investment people make on phone and tablets, then make everything you just did obsolete because of firmware?? I work in technology, I get 'change'. But really...",3,1,2019-11-30,1,2,0
"I came to write a review and saw so many negative opinions... ?  Then I scrolled through the customer images and that helped me understand and see what I thought.

I have not idea why people would have trouble, unless it's not connected properly and the directons weren't followed... Alexa answers my daughters questions on the way to school, shuffles my playlists... What were you expecting?!  Yes, it uses the internet on your phone!  You don't have unlimited data?  This probably isn't for you then....",5,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0

If your phone is connected to your car's bluetooth, the echo is connected as well. I have yet to have any issues there.A few things I'd change:",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"After all the integration of the Alexa features at home I had high expectations for the Alexa Auto.  First it really is a clumsy interface to you Alexa app on your phone, nothing more than a ugly external microphone for your phone.  The Alexa Auto must be paired to a phone to access the Bluetooth in your vehicle, then you must be running the Alexa app on your phone continuously for the Alexa Auto to be able to listen for your commands.  The one feature I was really hoping to use was the geo fencing to turn on routines as I approached home but as I sat in my living room the lights kept switching on and off as it apparently couldn't tell where we were.  This may work better when actually in the auto driving but it got so annoying during setup that I ended up disabling it before I ever made it to the vehicle.  One hint: set up in the vehicle, not in your home.  Ended up having to delete setup and redo in the vehicle because it couldn't connect to the vehicles Bluetooth.  The power cord for the Alexa Auto is another disappointment.  Despite the little cord grip on the vent mount it still weaves all over my dash and is just ugly.  The Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 7S is very sporadic and glitchy.  Heaven forbid if you finally get everything working and then stop for gas or something and have to go through the whole pairing battle again.  The best I have been able to do is:1) Start Alexa app on phone",1,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"Tried it in my car. Not that impressed. It can control streaming over my car's Bluetooth, which may be helpful if I was listening exclusivly to something from my phone, but I'm, not. I have a radio and a SiriusXM receiver in my car to listen to.  The Alexa can't change the channels or control the radio, etc. so you have to burn bandwith on your mobile service if you want to listen to something Alexa controlled. And that's if you are even receiving data service. And my car already has some on demand, voice activated features. So I took it out of my car. I have used it to stream and control volume etc. on my boat and that has been useful, although you are still burning bandwith if streaming. Why I really like this little device, is for what it can do and that it is little. That makes it a great TRAVEL accessory! I take it to hotels or Airbnbs or wherever I'm staying on the road. The device is synced to my phone. At my room I access the venue's wifi and plug the travel alexa in right next to my portable phone charging stand. At home, an Alexa device uses the home's wifi router to stream, etc. If you brought an Alexa Dot with you, you would have to sync it to the local router each time. As the auto/travel Alexa is synced through your phone, it works whenever your phone works. (by wifi in room or over the air data). I bring along a small bluetooth speaker (mine are either an Anker SoundCore Nano or a Bose SoundLink Micro), which is also syced to the phone. Then I can stream music, news, whatever through the bluetooth speaker from the phone, all controlled by the travel alexa. And since the bluetooth speakes have microphones built in, you can talk directly to them to control content and volume, which it relays to the travel Alexa. What I mean by that is that you can pick up the speaker and take it into the bathroom with you and still listen and control everything while leaving your phone on the charger with the travel alexa sitting next to it. Love to take my ""Daily Briefing"" (see Alexa features to set this up) and listen to my custom news briefings while I get ready! ( I set mine for my local tv station's news brief, followed by the BBC news, the weather and then the brief on last night's Daily Show!) When it's over, if I'm still in there, I can change the program to play a Prime Station, or Pandora, iHeart, Tune In radio or even SiriusXM channel, right from the speaker itself. The only feature the travel Alexa doesn't support as of now (that I've found) is a sleep timer. Hopefully no need in a car, but nice for a travel feature next to your hotel room bed. (Hey Amazon, add this feature!) It will set alarms, so it can be used to set a wake up alarm or wake to music. In addition, if you use a wifi hub to control your in-room wifi, then you have a synced router in the room which can also be used to control other smart control dexices like a smart plug or bulb. When I use a hub, I take along a smart plug to control a bedroom light. Very handy when in an unfamiliar room to be able to say ""Alexa, turn on travel light"" and have a light come on. But that's probably getting too ultra geek for most. Usully it's just the travel Alexa and the speaker.",4,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"I don't have a car that has the ability to play requested songs. So having echo auto linked to my amazon account, and playing through my bluetooth has been fun.  You do have to have amazon app on your phone, unlimited data and a car that that can play through bluetooth.  I love to just say ""Alexa play some country music"" or ""alexa what is the weather going to be today?""  I can ask ""Alexa, how long will it take for me to get to ___"" And alexa will say with current traffic how long it will take to get somewhere.  Or  I can ask "" Where is the nearest gas station"" and she will tell me.  However, I have not been able to get her to give me directions.  I still have to stop, open up the maps app, and load in the address and hit begin.  Which is kinda a bummer. I was hoping alexa would be able to give directions.  I have been able to say ""Alexa send a message to ___""  and she does send a text message to one of my contacts.  So that is a cool feature.  To be able to do this hands free makes it somewhat safer while driving. :)  I tried to have her make phone calls, but that seems to glitch up the system, as the call goes thru alexa, and caused some issues, so I don't use her for making calls anymore.  I received the echo auto  with an invitation, so only paid $24.95.  I feel it was worth that, I don't know that I would be happy if I had paid more.  I do love the vent holder tho, it works great on both my VW's and I have never had any issue with it falling off.",3,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I got this to replace a Chinese bluetooth aux adapter I had in my truck that was great for music but bad for phone calls.  This having the multiple microphones to do noise cancelling sounded awesome.  Well it's not.  Nobody can still hear me, if I take repeat calls, I have to reboot the device after the 3rd call, and randomly it will either pick up or create itself a high pitched frequency that gets played over the speakers.  The only way to stop it is to restart it.  It doesn't always connect to my phone, so I have to restart it.  I ask Alexa to play music and half the time she doesn't play the music she says.  Last night I asked to play Halloween music and rock music started playing.  I ask for Caribbean music and Who Let the Dogs Out plays.  When this happens, I restart the device.  If you can't tell, there's a whole lot of restarting going on.  I'm sorry I have this and I don't recommend it.

"I like several others, continue to have issues with getting the EA to work properly.  Hopefully eventually, I will get it to do what I want it to, and then I will revise this.  The issue that I have is that it continues to attempt to use BT when making calls, even though I have tried repeatedly to get it to do everything via the AUX connection.  I still have a few other ideas to get  this resolved but so far nothing has worked.I purchased the Echo Auto,(EA)  to use with my 2015 Mini Cooper Conv.  The mini-cooper is BT phone capable, (more  on this later), but does not have BT audio support.  In Massachusetts where I am live, they just passed a hands free law, making it illegal to use your phone while driving.  My friend who I talk to regularly told me he couldn't hear me via the Mini's standard BT, so I thought adding the Echo Auto that has 6 mics might improve the situation.",3,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0

For me, that was not enough to justify the price for how I use it in my car.I listen to Audible frequently in the car.  Using Alexa auto worked through the Alexa app and played the audiobook from the cloud instead of my phone - using data unnecessarily.  The voice commands to back up or go to a chapter were clunky.  So, just starting the Audible app on my phone and playing a downloaded audiobook proved a better solution.",3,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"I've had the Echo Auto since it first came out and use it daily.  While it has had a few issues along the way overall it has worked much better for me it seems than some other reviewers have experienced. When I first set it up it only took me maybe 5 or 10 minutes and was completed while sitting in my driveway. It entered setup mode, connected to my phone's internet and then the app walked me through the rest of the steps just as it has done when I've set up other Echo products. I've had very few issues with voice recognition, in fact 95% of the time even with lots of road noise in the background the Echo Auto easily understands my son who rides in the backseat. The main problems I've had is we can't seem to play games, such as 20 questions, on the Echo Auto as everytime we've tried it glitches out after a couple rounds and shuts off. We've also had a few times where it randomly restarted or couldn't connect but overall these have been minor inconveniences.I currently have mine connected through the auxiliary jack since my car doesn't have bluetooth so I cant speak on it's bluetooth capabilities. In fact one of the reasons I got it was so I would be able to do things hands free while driving despite not having bluetooth. I've used other similar devices in my car for the same reason so I'm used to the cords and they don't bother me at all but for someone whose car already has bluetooth I can see how the Echo Auto may seem redundant and like more of a hassle. For me being able to ask Alexa to make a phone call, read me my texts, tell me the weather, play my favorites playlists, turn on my lights at home, etc. all while driving is worth it and so far I've been very happy with my purchase.",4,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"My problems?  1. it doesn't always connect to my phone.  I have to have the app open, which I do not do by default.  Even if the app is open, it works about 75% of the time.  2. I have to use the AUX cable.  On my car, a GTI, that is in the center arm rest (stupid place for it).  So, I have cables draping down the dash for power, and over to my arm rest for sound...  3. With the AUX cable, I need it on volume 10 to match my other radio stations.  It doesn't seem to hold this setting, so I seem to be constantly working the volume on the stereo to see if it is connected and I cannot hear it, or if it isn't connected.  4. It was a nightmare to pair with my phone.  Once that was done, it is fine.So, if your car has bluetooth, you may be in luck.  If you do longer commutes, it may be worth it too - what is 2 minutes of setup for 2 hours of driving?  When it is working, it is awesome to have the news, all the songs of Amazon Music, to have your shopping lists right there.  For my car, for my situation?  It is a miss...",2,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

The other problem is with the routines I set up. I have Alexa tell me a message when I get to my work and another one when I get to my home. Unfortunately, Alexa tells me the one for work when I’m about a mile away and tells me the one for home even when I’m not in my car.

The device has to have a direct connection to your vehicle sound system through the auxiliary input and to power (USB), and your phone has to have the Amazon app. That's it. I admit the directions are not the best but this is perhaps the best answer to Sirius, Xfinity, etc, because one, you get it through Amazon Prime and are not paying a monthly subscription fee, and two, you do not have to listen to anything but what strikes your fancy 24 x 7 x 365 when you drive.

"Edited Review.After spending alot more time getting used to this,I've gotten to understand it more.The main issue is finding a location in the car to have the echo auto respond.The vent mount is helpful but be creative and find YOUR own spot.Once i did,The Echo Auto had become alot more fun and useful to have.The best part now is I'm not yelling at it,looking like a guy talking(Yelling)At himself.I finally got my invite to order this and was excited to try it out.First things first,Three claim is 8 mics and it can hear you over music wind etc.But i find myself screaming most of the time to wake it and that's with my music very low,I don't listen to loud music at all.That's my biggest complaint.The vent mount is a good idea but i don't like it covering most of the vent and with having to scream to wake it i close the vent to limit any extra noise..I tried this connected with a Bluetooth adaptor and in my Dodge Caliber i have an Aux input on my radio hands free calling isn't so hand free no matter how much i try and according to Amazon i should be able to say Alexa hand up, it doesn't with the Bluetooth adaptor i have to hit the function button and Aux i have to grab the phone and hang up.That's for unanswered calls,if i was on a call i just let the other end hand up and wait for it to disconnect..Now making calls isn't as easy as saying""Alexa call home"" i often get  ""I don't know that"" .Same goes with trying to send a text message.The included wires could be longer so we had more options to place this out of sight,Due to me not liking the vent mount I use velcro to mount it,Longer wires would help.I have several echo devices at home,And the drop in feature works fine,Especially when i can't call home,I drop in or make an announcement.I see potential but it still needs work and paying the invite price of $25 makes it not so much a disappointment,But I'd be a little more disappointed if i paid $49.I Hoped for a better hands free experience,and with having to yell to get it to wake I'm still 50/50 with it.One other thing your stuck with Alexa as your wake word as of this review.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,1
"**edit** stopped working completely, don’t botherAs a very frequent Alexa user I decided to try this out. The one thing I couldn’t stand was getting in my car and having to Bluetooth my phone and tap around to mess with a streaming music services to find what I wanted to listen to. Now, I can get in my car as ask Alexa to play what I want or anything that I wish to know on the go. It’s perfect for me and actually may be a good safety feature for some drivers as they no longer will need to be on their phone to do a lot of things. I had one issue with the device which turned out not to be an issue but just ...a thing. Not sure if it’s just me or my car or if it’s how you need to do it but here goes....I don’t really want anyone breaking into my car so I unplug my device and put it, and the cable, out of sight. After hooking this all up it worked fine but when I went out to my car the next time and connected it, no power. I tried it another time or two and it was just dead...I thought. The device does not work for me unless it is plugged in PRIOR to me starting my vehicle. When it do it that way it works like a charm! Again, not sure if that’s just my car but if anyone thinks theirs isn’t working, try it that way. I guess maybe the device is set up for a more perfect world than we have that objects can remain plugged in and in plain sight, so possibly down the line, if it is a universal thing that it needs to be plugged in before starting the vehicle, that they change that. It just stinks if you forget to plug it in and then start the car. I won’t turn the car off and on again so I’m back to tapping on my phone for that drive.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I really want to like it, but there are just too many annoyances with it.1) The volume control is just awful. I have to have this input at an audio level of about 25-30 to get the volume and sound I want. My normal radio input is at about 12-15. So, what this does is that if I forget to turn down the volume when switching inputs I blow out my eardrums. I've done it twice, and it's very annoying.",3,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"I received this Echo Auto very quickly after it came out, having asked to be among the first round of users. I wrote a 1-star review after a few days. ""Connectivity problems, both Bluetooth and USB, so off and on, with no rhyme or reason, I just unplugged it and stuck it in the glove box. I own 7 Echo products, so I doubt it is user error."" I got a call from customer support in response to my review. I was traveling and couldn't call back. In the meantime, I read somewhere that Amazon had pushed out an update. I did a hard reset, set it up again and have been running it again for about a week. It is much improved. In order to function, Echo Auto has to connect to the Internet, of course, and this happens by connecting to your smartphone via the Alexa App. The Alexa app has to be running. My device is now reconnecting when I get back in the car and turn on the engine, although the time it takes to connect can vary from just a few seconds to a minute or 2. During this process, unfortunately, the device says ""I'm having trouble connecting through the Alexa app. When safe to do so, open the app."" Or words to that effect. Unfortunately, that's the prompt you get even during the normal reconnection process. Anyway, I suppose by way of an update, the connectivity problems that plagued many early users seems to be considerably improved.  I also note that, perhaps not surprisingly since this device is for use in a running car, I sometimes I have yell at it to get it to respond. It may not help that Amazon has designed it to clip to an air vent, which may add to the signal-noise problem. Overall, I'm finding the device useful. It will improve, I suspect, with subsequent software upgrades and the inevitable future new versions with hardware revisions.",3,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0

"let me start off by saying that I don't write many reviews. That being said I believe that this product is aimed at two groups of people. the first group of people are the ones that have to have everything Alexa. This product brings the function of Alexa to your car. It allows you to have full access to all of your Amazon services and be able to do things like turn lights on when you are pulling into your drive way.The second group of people that will love it, I am in this group, are the ones that have slightly older vehicles that do not support Bluetooth or only support calling over Bluetooth. I have a 2012 Nissan which only allows me to use Bluetooth to talk on the phone. That's great an all but for listening to music, pod casts or Audible I have to use an auxiliary cable. This is where the Echo Auto hits it out of the park. I am able to stream everything from my phone to my truck through Bluetooth now. The Echo Auto plugs into my truck's auxiliary port, so if you want to listen to over the air radio you will not have access to Alexa. This has not proven to be a big deal for me since I've been streaming most of my audio through my phone including asking Alexa to go to my local radio station on the I-Heart-Radio app. If you car doesn't have any type of Bluetooth but does have an auxiliary port then you can use it to make phone calls too and hear the audio through your radio.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"My car has no bluetooth, so for me this was a game changer and with the Alexa functionalities i was just ecstatic! i was really loving it and using it daily until... one day, it just died...  It wasnt turning on, not charging, no nothing! I contacted amazon help to which they replied that there was a known issue hence they could not send me a replacement - I still havent received any news on why did it die.  However, since I really love the product I bought another one which is working amazingly - I'm still worried about the new one dying on me like the previous one but until now I love it!",3,1,2019-10-31,1,1,0

"Honestly, this is my absolute BEST purchase of 2019, hands down!!Before continuing to disclose my experience with this product, let me outline my vehicle situation for those of you with compatibility questions:",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"I got my Echo auto by invite. I was excited to try it out because the car I had at the time I received the invitation did not have Bluetooth, so I was eager to have Alexa and some BT functions via AUX port. Sadly, it took several months to get the product after the invitation and in the meantime I sold the car and bought one with BT capabilities. I decided to go ahead and buy my Echo auto anyway just to answer the question why would I need this if I already have BT in the car.Initially, the setup was a bit bumpy because I wanted to try connecting via AUX port for audio output. It was quite a mess because while the Echo worked through the AUX input on my radio, it would not play anything through that port (the BT input would also go dead). Each time I wanted to hear music or radio, Echo would go mute (still responding correctly to ""pause"" or ""stop"" commands thought). In the end, I just decided to use BT exclusively. It worked much better. Echo connects via BT to the phone (not the car), so it acts as a voice interface between you and your phone with audio output on the car's BT via phone audio BT out. Not bad. I cannot say I am completely satisfied, however, for a couple of reasons. One is I cannot tell Alexa to call into conferences because it somehow recognizes the fact that the number I am calling is a conference number (stored in my phone as (number),,# type of entry) and wants me to use some calendar function, which I am not willing to do. The second is sometimes the connection between Echo and my phone (more likely, Echo gets dropped by the Alexa app) just does not function and I have to resort to eliminating Echo auto in the Alexa app and adding it again later. This morning the app just kept crashing (even after resetting cache etc.). It did not crash once I was away from the car (and Echo auto). Finally, the vent mount is worthless (good thing I did not have to pay for it), but the sticky rubber pad with built-in magnet included is quite nice. Let us just hope it will not leave a stain from the glue once it is removed. Note that all things Alexa can do, such as controlling your smart appliances, work as well as in any other Alexa device.",3,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I was really excited about this. I have a 2013 Ford C-Max. The Ford Sync system is terrible and the voice recognition is so useless I did a master reset and made sure my phone was not connected in any way. I was hoping and hoping that Echo Auto would provide a better experience while driving as I have long commutes. Anyway, Echo Auto doesn't work at all for me. First, the included mount is nearly useless due to the shape and movement of the vents in my vehicle. Second, it does not connect to my vehicle in any way. Bluetooth? Nope. Aux audio in? Nope (no audio jack in the C-Max). So, this means that any audio just comes out of my phone or the Auto device, it does not use my car's audio. That is really unhelpful...if that's all I can do, I will just use my phone like I do now and call it good. AS my other vehicle is even older, I doubt it will work there, either though I haven't tried it. I am an Amazon fan and have been a customer for over 20 yrs (not that they care), and have both an Echo and Amazon ""smart"" plugs. I was really expecting this Auto device to be amazing. It isn't. Not even close. Purchase it if you like and want to try it out, but my recommendation is to save your money. Why any company, including automotive companies, is trying to beat out the smartphone companies is anyone's guess. The smart move IMHO would be for a car company to make it so it didn't matter what you brought, phone, iPod, whatever, they all just worked. This will come into play with autonomous and more ride-sharing...are you going to enter your username and password for every service you want whenever you use someone else's car? Of course not...it should just work. Here's hoping someone will figure it out...it just isn't Amazon (yet). Just keep using your phone.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"I bought this via an invite.  It was easy to install in my Mazda 3.  I’m using my car’s Bluetooth with it.  At first, I couldn’t get verbal directions via my iPhone when playing Amazon Music via the Echo Auto.  Just got tones — no speech.  But, that glitch has been fixed.Asking for directions via Echo Auto directly is currently a waste of time.  Even if it finds what you want, you have to access your phone.  Not something I want to do while driving!  So, I find myself manually accessing the maps via the phone before leaving & using Siri for directions while driving (flaws there too, but at least it’s touch free).",1,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Ive been glad to have this on long road trips in the wee hours. That last hour drive to get home is brutal, but it for sure helps to have alexa to play games with. The bad part is that a lot of these skills seem like they arent fully baked in the first place, but it works as good in my car as it does in my house.. which is sometimes kind of iffy.  anyway i use my tablet in my car generally to play music or podcasts w an aux cable... so i dont leave alexa plugged in all the time, just put her on when i want her. I like to get the live news on the way home from work through it. but its not like in my house where its just on and if think of somethign i ask it. I plug it in deliberately when i want to use it and thats fine for my purposes. to leave it on all the time i can only use my phone and not my tablet since it works through the phone.  i got a used one on a sale and only paid $20 for mine. absoultely worth $20. not sure id pay the full retail price for it, but it is nice to have as a luxury item.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0

"I have been looking at these since last year and finally decided to try it out. Set up was not difficult, the instructions were basically plug it in, open your Alexa app and follow the directions. It didn't work right away and the troubleshooting was of little help. I fiddled with it for a few minutes and got it connected. It works decently well; it plays Amazon Music and I can add things to my lists. It works as expected most of the time. It does occasionally (at least once per day) act as if it has lost connection with my phone, even though my phone shows it as connected. It is a simple fix: open the app and click a button. When you are using this device to not have to interact with your phone while driving, it defeats the purpose of having it. Perhaps having a one-touch refresh button on the home screen of the phone or better yet, on the Echo device itself would be a significant improvement.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase but am looking forward to seeing what improvements are made in the future.",3,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"I have just about every Alexa product made and have never had a problem setting up anything--lights, thermostat, etc., are all controlled by Alexa, so I was excited to purchase the Echo Auto.  Our house and garage lights are set up to come on at a certain time, but it would have been great to have the ability to tell Alexa to turn them on if I came home early.  And I love listening to Amazon Music in the house and was hoping I could ask Alexa for music in the car instead of playing songs off my iPhone.  What a disappointment!  First of all, connecting is very difficult.  I finally got it to work sporadically after much experimentation (the quick start instructions are not particularly helpful) but I had to have both the auto charger and audio cord connected, which meant cords were everywhere.  Yes, there is a clip for the cords but it doesn't work well and it is still in a very awkward position.  When it does connect, it is only for a few minutes.  It works off my iPhone, not independently, so if you are not in a city with a constantly strong signal, using it is just a frustrating experience.  My iPhone plays through my car speakers even with a weak signal but not the Alexa Auto.  It constantly wants you to reconnect, which means that, while driving (unless you keep pulling over) you have to open Alexa on your iPhone and go through the connection process multiple times.  I think the flaw is that it doesn't work independently and anything less than a full signal on your phone causes it to malfunction.  After about a week, I pulled it out of the car because it is pretty useless.  It would be annoying enough to have to connect to Alexa each time if it actually worked more than a few minutes, not to mention the cords interfering with everything, but when it can't connect to my phone, which works fine, even with less than four bars, it's not worth the frustration and trouble.  Both the car and phone are both fairly new and work flawlessly so it's not like I'm using outdated equipment with it that is incompatible.  It's just a bad product.  I think people would be willing to pay more for a self-contained unit that functions better but Amazon has a long way to go before Echo Auto works as it should.",1,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0
"I have 6 different Echo products in my house and many other devices with Alexa integration so an Echo Auto was ideal to have in the car.  I pre-ordered when I still had my 12 year old truck and it came just after I got rid of that vehicle and got a new 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited X with CarPlay and Android Auto; I use CarPlay with my iPhone 11 which is awesome.  The only issue with CarPlay though is that Apple Home doesn't integrate with many of my home devices that are currently using Alexa so I can't control them from CarPlay.  However, by using Echo Auto, I can control those devices while in my vehicle.  Unfortunately though I can't use CarPlay and Echo Auto (bluetooth) at the same time but it's easy for me to switch to bluetooth while driving since Jeep has an excellent Uconnect system.  With all of that being said, here are my thoughts on Echo Auto.Some of the issues that I have with it are that in order for Echo Auto to work, you not only have to have the Alexa app open on your phone, but you will also have to click on a Warning message telling you not to interact with the Alexa app while driving; this has to be done each time that you get in the car.  Having so my Echos in my house and not having to deal with that, I'm a bit spoiled and annoyed with having to do that each time.",4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"I was one of the people who waited many months for this product to come out.  I have all of my lights, my thermostat, a petcube treat dispenser, my front door and a vacuum all on alexa.  Adding this to my car has been great!  We were already used to using the amazon app in the car to allow us to verbally change to the next song on road trips.  The echo auto does everything I hoped it would.  The speakers are so good that was able to place the device out of site in the car.  It picks up our request even over the sound of highway traffic while speaking at a normal tone.  It automatically makes a ""ding"" sound when you turn your car on to alert you it has connected to your phone.I love that I can be driving and randomly ask ""what's the weather supposed to be throughout the day today""  or  ""how far away is Costco?"".  When we arrive home from activities in the evening, I can tell it to ""unlock the front door""  or ""turn on kitchen light""  or ""set temperature to 71"".  It definitely is an upgraded alexa experience to be able to say these commands before existing the car.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"I really like this, as my car is older (2012) and doesn't have built-in ""smart"" features. It makes using services like Audible easier and it is a lot easier to listen through the car speakers instead of the phone.It's also a great way to get Alexa in your car.",4,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"It does not have a touch screen,  Why do they ask how I like it?  In order to use this thing, you must, every time:  connect Alexa to phone Bluetooth, connect phone to auto entertainment blue tooth, run Alexa app in foreground (not background). Then go to Bluetooth Audio on car entertainment system.  This replaces the satellite radio.  You cannot have both at the same time.  So, if I rely on Alexa Auto, my satellite radio subscription  is wasted.  Then, I can get the Serius XM stuff I’ve already paid for on Alexa with Amazon Prime, that I have also paid for.  Of course, I can send commands from the car to everything in my house.  But, I can do that with the Alexa app on my phone using the cellular data network.  Similarly for everything...  I can even ask questions using my phone and the Alexa app.  The Auto Alexa also has frustrating latency.  The same things can be accomplished on the phone immediately.  Bottom line:  I can do anything that Alexa Auto does with just my smartphone on Bluetooth....and I can use my Serius subscription simultaneously.  What a bad idea!",2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

"So I have a love/hate (more hate) relationship with my Echo Auto.  When it connects and works, I love it, but this is the problem, it constantly loses connection.  Sometimes it is as easy as just closing and opening the app, but many times it takes deleting the app, downloading the Alexa app and reconnecting like setting up a new device.  This is very inconvenient.  I had it working great on a long trip, but then input in Waze for my trip directions and it lost connection and took me days of trying to get it reconnected.  I mean days!!  I since figured out how to get Waze as my default thru Alexa, so that helped on the next long trip, but halfway thru we lost connection and it would not reconnect until we were at our destination and I could physically sit and play with it for ten minutes.  If this worked as it should, it would be fabulous.  I just think there are a lot of bugs in it that need to be worked out.  I want to love it, but now I rarely use it because having to reconnect it every time I get into my car is too much of a pain in the a$$.",3,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0

I don't care about that, but I know many folks will.  4) It is a bit awkward to pair/unpair, but that's more a quibble about my phone, I think.I suspect most will like the newer vent-mount better, but I liked the older dash-mount.

I haven't tried to connect in a few weeks because I don't have time to devote to repeatedly to try and get it to connect. Two times did I get everything to connect at once on the first try (Echo auto, iPhone, and car).  One of those times, Alexa was saying gibberish, so I quit using.  The last time I tried, I got the Echo connected to my phone, but then not to my car's Bluetooth. Get connected to my car's Bluetooth, then I'd lose connectivity to Echo.

"After being on the wait list in eager anticipation for nearly a year, I can't believe how disappointed I am in this item. I've had an Echo Dot wired into my car since the first week the Dot began shipping, and with the exception of it's over sensitivity to the windows being open, or the AC being on full blast, it responds incredibly well to voice commands, even when it is playing music at incredible decibel levels. It stays connected to my phone's WiFi hotspot reliably, and transitions immediately and reliably from my home WiFi router (preferred connection) when in the driveway, to the Galaxy smart phone as I pull away from home.The Echo Auto, has incredible (and unresolvable) problems transferring WiFi connections mid-song or mid-conversation, and when the phone switches cell towers, the Echo Auto goes brain dead all too often.

"A while back, I had this bright idea to put an Echo dot in my car.  Utilizing the car wifi and a good attitude, I assumed that this would provide me with the same experience that I gave with Alexa at home.  I was very sadly mistaken.  So after abandoning the idea, I was skeptical of Echo Auto.  When I recieved it, i set it up and started on my way with a little apprehension thinking that I would have the same experience and struggles that my previous attempt brought me.  I was very surprised when the Echo Auto was able to pick up, and easily fulfil my requests.  The fact that it works through the phone makes it very awesome and the fact that its able to be positioned almost anywhere is even better.  Luckily I have a USB port on the front of my radio and so I was able to place the Echo Auto just under my stereo which keeps it in view but out of the normal line of sight so you almost forget about it.  Having it work through my phone and bluetooth is outstanding and I have yet to run into any issues after around a month and a half of use.  I use it every single time i'm in the car and it just works.  I highly recommend getting one of these for your car.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Its hard to tell if its the Alex Auto or the Bluetooth or my radio.  I like the device, though at first I thought it really wasn't needed with a car that already had a radio system that integrated your phone already.  I have an iPhone, so I could ask Siri for some of the same information or use Apple Apps to keep notes, ask directions, etc.  But after awhile of using it in the car, I found the integration much easier than using those others with the following caveats:  1) Alexa had a hard time with car noise sometimes picking up my voice.  Found it easier to mute the radio, then ask. 2) Sound would cut out at the beginning of what Alexa was telling me.  We had a laugh when I asked for the scores of the Sunday Football games.  So the first score would be dropped, but then we'd hear the 2nd score.  It really was funny.  So, I like the device, but it needs some work.  With some tweaks it would be a great addition to either cars w/ bluetooth connectivity already, or invaluable to those that don't.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I got an invitation to try the Echo Auto for half price and decided to go for it as my car does not have navigation and I wanted to have hands free control over music,  navigation,  phone calls,  etc. I have a 2015 VW Golf that has a robust Bluetooth system of its own that works well for calls that are incoming,  but is not hands free for placing calls.When this arrived,  I got it set up and running in about ten minutes.  I was very dissapointed that I cannot change the wake word and am stuck with Alexa,  and hope that changes in the future. My husband wants to call her Sweet Cheeks which would be hilarious,  but I would be content with computer as the wake word.

"An excellent way to put Alexa in your car and access the Amazon ecosystem.  It pairs quickly and reliably. Anything I can do on my Echo at home, I can do on the road. No complaints.  Suggestion: Measure the distance from the vent you intend to mount the unit to the power outlet. Add your estimate for routing the wire unobtrusively. That's the length of USB cord you'll need. It may be more or less than the length supplied. I needed a cord about three inches shorter than the one in the box to run it neatly and unobtrusively from the dash to my console. I also put a double 2.4A outlet adapter in the socket to power it. Neat installation. I could probably use one or two tiny wire clip command strip thingees to run the wire even more securely, but I'm ok with it as it is.  Or I guess I could pull apart the dash to wire it up completely, but the beauty of this is it's easy. I'm not OCD about it. The unit itself works like a champ.

"If you have an older vehicle without bluetooth, this an almost a must buy. I looked into two other options before settling on the Alexa auto.A bluetooth fm transmitter, and an anker bolt.

"Bottom Line: This is exactly like any other Echo/Alexa device that does not have a screen.  It does everything that any other Echo/Alexa device does, only this one relies on your smart phone for wireless/data connection, and also connects via Bluetooth to your car stereo for quality sound.  The Echo Auto does have a built-speaker, but the sound quality is roughly equal to (perhaps slightly poorer than) that of a first-generation Echo Dot.  The Echo Auto comes with a mount that attaches to an air conditioning vent.  It is powered via USB.  Alexa is a solid voice assistant; while Alexa is accessible via the Alexa app on a smart phone, it is far more convenient and safer to use an Echo Auto.  The Echo Auto is small, slim and responsive.Use: I have been using the Echo Auto for about three weeks.  Rather than using the included mount, I have attached the Echo Auto to the underside of my stereo using a Command strip (a pair of Velcro strips with adhesive on one side).  The Echo Auto has been able to respond to commands even with music playing at a respectable volume.",5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"I have a 2013 Nissan Altima which doesn't have Apple Play nor Android Auto.  Since my vehicle doesn't have either of these two, setup was very easy and I actually prefer Echo Auto over the setup that my Nissan came equipped with.Some of the downfalls that I've noticed is that sometimes Google Maps doesn't open when I ask for directions to a certain places, trying to skip songs isn't always recognized, Alexa doesn't understand certain tasks that I've asked her to do.",3,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0

FINALLY! Alexa in my car! So excited to get an invite after waiting absolutely forever. I'd read that the invite timing might be related to the autos you had saved in your Amazon garage and my vehicle is ancient so Amazon might have figured I'd be a bad fit and put me at the bottom of the list. My 2002 Ford Explorer - with no bluetooth or aux - works perfectly with Alexa using an old cassette tape adapter I'd bought years ago to use for hands free phone calls. Hadn't used the thing in years but it still worked when I tested it so I was all set when Alexa arrived the next day.Alexa was easy to set up and as long as I remember to turn on the power to my radio (which I'm now leaving at the cassette setting) she's up and running within a minute. When I've forgotten to hit the radio power button I can see her light up as she hears me and I assume is trying to answer me as I keep asking her if she's there?  After a couple rounds of this my aging brain kicks into gear and I remember she needs the radio powered on for me to transmit through the speakers.,5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"Amazon has done it again, we ask and they deliver, this has been a long wait for me, so as soon as Echo Auto was available I jumped on it. And it did not disappoint! So what is it actually? So it’s simply a device that gives you Bluetooth in your car with Alexa built in, simple but for those of us who prefer Alexa over Siri it has been a long time waiting but worth the wait. The Bluetooth works  and works really well, as soon as you power on the device, for me it's simply  starting the car, your phone will automatically connect to echo auto and is ready for your command, you can use your voice or just play music or books from your phone and the sound comes out of your car speakers from the auxiliary connected to the echo auto. The eight microphones on echo make Alexa able to hear you no matter how loud the car is, with the AC blasting and two small kids screaming the device is able to hear my commands. It's nice having Alexa ready to go whether you want to continue your book, play music for driving, open the garage, drop in on the kitchen or just ask Alexa if those clouds overhead are just overcast or should you reschedule the back yard camping trip.Now I am just waiting for an echo bike mount and I'll be set.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"Oh where do I start?I got on the invitation list over a year ago. Then one day they sent me an email that said that I may buy this product now, and to use the link provided with the coupon code.

"Our family has integrated  several different Amazon devices into our daily lives (several Fire tablets, 4 Echo Dots, Fire TV, etc.) which has been a pleasant and useful addition, until now. This latest device has great potential, however, it unfortunately is not ready for the masses. The device constantly and randomly disconnects, which requires going into the Alexa app (Dear Amazon, this is for a vehicle...most of us, if not all, will be using this while driving) to once again connect. Also, in order to use this device you must keep your vehicle's audio source on Bluetooth, negating the effective use of the radio or other audio devices. If you are listening to a radio station and want to query Alexa, you have to switch to Bluetooth, awake Alexa (hoping the device didn't disconnect), pose your query (keeping your fingers crossed that the device recognized your request) and then wait. The results are scattered. More often than not, Alexa doesn't recognize the request or pulls random, unrelated information.We had high hopes and wanted to love this, but it fell astonishingly short. Waste of money. I advise avoiding this OR waiting for a better version.",1,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"I bought this primarily to add Bluetooth connectivity to my vehicle's audio system. My factory radio has an auxiliary-in port and I was previously plugging in my phone with each drive. This device benefits from being mounted at dash top level and in the center for optimal microphone pickup of the driver and passenger commands. With a little knowledge and creativity, the cabling and the power source can be hidden to give it more of an integrated appearance. Initial setup is performed through the Alexa app. I had some difficult days early on where the phone didn't want to pair with Alexa, don't know if it was the phone or Alexa, but they behave nicely now. Every once in a while, it doesn't respond, but resets with the power disconnected and reconnected. Now, having Bluetooth with Alexa in my vehicle, making/taking phone calls while driving is hands-free. I can request music from Pandora, Amazon Music, and others by voice command, request weather reports, adjust my home thermostat as I'm leaving work, turn on the lights at home as I enter my neighborhood... all the stuff you already use Alexa for, but from your vehicle. I was on the fence about this product initially, but I'm happy with it now.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
When it works it worksWhen it Doesn't it friggin makes you want to throw it out the window. I have an iphone and with this Alexa it has to and wants to know your location every moment. It's tracking your location so much to the point where my phone tells me hey this things tracking you when you're not using it. In order for this thing to actually give you weather and directions through waze you have to let it track your location at all times. Also I have spotify linked up to my Alexa devices at home with little issues. In the car however it will totally have syncing issues with the spotify app and then go to amazon music or say sorry and not play anything. I don't hate it but if I pad 50 dollars for this then I would've returned it already.,2,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"I drive a car over 10 years old, just before blu-tooth and way before Alexa ever entered a car manufacturer's dreams. I was a life long Sirius XM subscriber, paying a chunk of change annually just to listen to a handful (or less) of stations. And honestly, lack of control of the music with Sirius made it a worse money pit.  Constantly pushing the radio buttons, or looking at the phone for various reasons was going to get me in a serious accident at some point, and I'm old enough to know that my luck was going to run out sometime. This device has worked perfectly and always connects, adds Alexa integration to my car, brings Amazon Prime's million song library to my car and I dropped Sirius like a hot potato. This truly has allowed me to keep my eyes on the road where they belong and lets me do my surfing, messaging, and listening all by my voice instead.  It is too bad that others seem to have problems with the device, but there has never been an issue that wasn't resolved by a quick disconnect of the A/C charger plug, or switching my phone's blu-tooth off and then on. It has given my car the upgrade I need, and others should thank the Auto for making the highway a little safer.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"In theory this would be a great little companion to have in the car for long or commuter trips.  But unfortunately it doesn't work about the half the time.  When asked simple requests like the weather or directions I get ""I'm having trouble with the connection; please try again later"".  I get these responses even when my phone displays all 5 signal bars. When it actually has a good connection it usually replies about the same as my in-home units.  One reason I got this was to control my garage door.  Even that it only works about half the time as well.  First, the audio will only work via Bluetooth so if I am playing music through Apple Car play the Auto Echo does not override the existing audio playing.  I have to manually select ""Bluetooth"" in my audio controls and repeat the question. Very cumbersome.  The most annoying part is I can ask the same exact questions and half the time it gives a ""I am unable to do that"" then the next time says ""ok"".  Do not understand how the same questions only works 50% of the time.  Very frustrating.  For $20 it may be worth to have as secondary device in your car to assist with music or weather but any more than that you're wasting your money and will just frustrate you.",2,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"This device is a pain in the neck. I really wanted this to work for road trips, but it doesn't even do the most basic things that are expected, like giving directions and playing music. Music streaming is very staticy and interrupted. When I stream music from the phone through my car's Bluetooth, there is never an issue with that. Also, this device seems to mess with my phone's Bluetooth connectivity. It is as if I had to unpair the echo manually every time I try to connect another device. Calls also won't go through the echo, and since the echo will prevent my phone from connecting to other Bluetooth devices, I can't accept ANY calls while my phone is connected to the echo, not even through my car's Bluetooth and speakers. Trying to connect echo via the AUX cable to the car's speakers to avoid the Bluetooth connection issue was unsuccessful also. The echo device will automatically try to connect to the Bluetooth system no matter how hard you try to avoid that. Then there is the issue that you will need the Alexa app on your phone. It sucks too much power out of your phone, so the battery levels go down way faster when you run that app. Also, the Alexa app will practically intercept most of anything on your phone and try to channel other apps' activities through the Alexa app. *Except* for the Google Maps app, where you would really like to have hands free access while driving, even only through the Alexa app without the Echo device in your car. But it's not working. The whole idea is just not really well thought through yet. I really wanted this to work, but so far every time I tried, it has not just made things harder while driving, it makes them even impossible. Very disappointing. Hope they come up with a better device.(I use a BLU G9 Pro for a phone, in case that matters.)",1,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"I have really been impressed by this little device. It really is ""Alexa in your car."" It offers all the advantages of my Echo and Echo Dot devices in my car. Voice recognition is better, quicker and easier than the Navigation/infotainment system built into my 2013 Toyota Prius C. I am able to make calls, listen to music and other Alexa skills via voice recognition. There is a slight delay in the voice recognition but not a big problem. It can be adjusted in settings. This device is smaller and lighter than I thought it would be.  That is great because I was concerned about using the vent mount. Generally I don't like mounting anything on a vent because it disrupts the air flow or falls off. Neither has happened with this device. Both my car and cell phone are bluetooth capable so I did not try to connect it via the included AUX USB cable. Bluetooth setup via the Alexa app on my Samsung Galaxy S7 phone was easy. Just follow the instructions. I like the rolling blue light indicator as it reacts to my Alexa commands. Note that bluetooth in both your car and phone must be on if you connect it via Bluetooth. The Alexa app must be running on your phone and the USB power cable must be connected to your Alexa auto device and the included power adapter that plugs into your car's power input to make this device work. Having the Alexa app running in the background on my phone is the only disadvantage I can see in using this device. I bought 2 retractable USB to Micro USB cords for connecting this device and charging my phone that make capable management a little easier (2 pack for about $8 on Amazon). I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,1
"I received this item for Christmas and honestly, after reading reviews my expectations weren’t high. This thing has been amazing! So amazing I had to go out of my way to write a review. I drive a 2012 Acura MDX. I think having Bluetooth capability is a key with this item. It connects right away every time I start up my car and I say “Alexa, play _____” it works every single time. I do not use this for navigation because my car has that built in, but I have tested it with Alexa a few times with no issues. My primary use for Alexa is to play any music I want hands free and ask Alexa all the random things I wonder about on my commute. We have Amazon Unlimited music which really enhances the awesomeness of this device. I highly recommend giving this a fair chance. Anyone who says they are having issues either has poor phone connectivity/an older phone,  a car that it just isn’t compatible due to age or whatever, or set up was not done properly. This Alexa Auto literally works the exact same as any other Alexa Echo device we own. It is everything I hoped it would be.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I got my Echo auto several months ago. At first, I was very frustrated trying to get it hooked up. I might be able to get the music to play, but then my phone calls weren't coming in through my car speakers. If I got my phone calls to work again, then the Echo wouldn't respond to my requests.  Finally, after several days of trying and trying and reading both my car manual and the Echo manual, I got it to work! Now I can't imagine not having it. The music sound amazing through my car speakers; the music stops if I receive a call and it switches over to the phone mode. I like just asking Alexa for driving directions while I am driving somewhere..I have often had the Echo auto add appointments to my calendar while driving...whatever Alexa does on my home Echo I can do in my car...all while not taking my eyes off the road...my phone stays in my purse and I can just talk to Alexa and request whatever it is I need. I usually listen to Pandora while in my car, but I can listen to any Amazon music also, or any of the plethora of stations available.

"I won't go into the details about the invite a year ago but only to say that having waited a long time and relying on Amazon's amazing use of technology, I'm somewhat disappointed with this launch. Firstly, the instructions are a level or two above the average user's knowledge of hi-tech. An example is the connection process.  It should spell out the fact that the Echo Auto FOAD Bluetooth is embedded in the Echo list in the app.Another problem is the common dropping of the connection from the automatic mode in the car. I've also tried to speed up the interaction between the unit and my verbal commands but it still lags. Finally, my connection only works when the car is in the Bluetooth connection screen. I'd recommend a fix that would allow he 'Alexa' command from anywhere (like 'OK Google' on Android phones). This would be a sure winner!",3,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Supposed to be hands free, but has to have connectivity to the Alexa app, which it cannot seem to maintain,so the app has to be reconnected manually on your phone. Tried using it as navigation aid going someplace I already knew. She tried to take me to a totally bogus address after reading back the correct address to me. Doesn't seem to understand commands for Blink systems, even though I use the same commands successfully in the house. I don't think it was worth the half price I paid for it as part of the test, and I know it's not worth the current price. Just connect your phone to your car and forget this thing altogether.",2,1,2019-10-14,1,1,0
"Let me start by saying we're no strangers to Alexa.  We have an Echo or dot in almost every room in our house, so we use Alexas a lot and know what to expect.  I was so excited to get my invitation for the Echo Auto and couldn't wait to have Alexa in my car as well.  And that's pretty much where the excitement stopped.First, it took about 45 minutes on the phone with tech support to get the Echo Auto paired to my phone.  But finally, we got it connected.  Tech support was super helpful and patient, and probably the highlight of my Echo Auto experience.",2,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like this, but this Alexa is more of a hassle than its worth. If I want to use Alexa, I need to check to make sure she’s functional before I leave, I need to make sure the app for Alexa is open and any app that I want to use, because she can’t start apps herself. If I suddenly realized I need to go somewhere and ask Alexa for directions, she won’t start navigating until I confirm it on the app. What a useless ‘co-pilot’. Why couldn’t a verbal confirmation be enough? If I wanted to pull over to okay it, I would have just pulled over and set up the directions myself. Spotify sometimes doesn’t work, when it does, if I’m not already streaming on my phone through the car on an aux/phone cable, Alexa with stream it through her Bluetooth connection which kills the base and makes it sound like it’s planing though a tin can. I’m not sure what exactly causes this because I connected my phone with Bluetooth to the car to test that and it didn’t have the same problem Alexa was having. Overall, I’ve wasted so much time having to work around all the little problems and nuances that it’s counter acted any time I could have saved with it. It has potential, but needs some serious work to reach it.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"This product should destroy satellite radio by giving the user total control over their streamed content, but presently it is a frustrating device. Without solving some key problems, users will find that shouting at Siri or Google is more convenient than interacting with Auto Alexa.First: Network Connectivity.

This disrupts the active streaming content, causes Alexa to fail to understand or comply with commands, and lasts for periods of time from seconds to minutes.",2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Overall, this is a good Bluetooth adapter for a car without that connectivity.  I can't say how well it works for devices that already have Bluetooth, but I imagine it works well enough.  It uses Alexa commands through the Alexa App, and for the most part I have had no issues there.  I am sure I could use it more, but I was already using an adapter and am still learning the tricks with Alexa in my car.One thing I will say, I do not like to use this device for texting.  For some reason Amazon thought it would be a good idea to create an audio recording and also send a text transcript.  I would rather just have a normal text sent.  There may be a setting to change this, but I have not been able to easily find it.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I've had spent more time running device setup under Alexa, than enjoying the music. Once it's setup and running, it works well and the music quality is excellent. But it could work well today and the next time I get in the car it runs into connection issues. I've  had ran setup so many times that I finally got tired of the waste of time and gave up on it. Bought two of these and it has been a complete waste of money.Update 02/07/2020: Since I posted this review, an Amazon customer service rep tried to contact me, but I wasn't available. He did sent me an email later on apologizing for the issues I listed and made recommendations on how to try to solve them. I took me a while to get over the frustrations I felt previously, and day before yesterday, I decided to give this gadget another try. So far, it's working as it should or as described.

It took me over 3 hours and calling amazon to get it paired with my phone and when I finally did it paired using the aux cord setting and not blue tooth. So I had to go thru the maze and mess of set up all over again. Also unless you have Apple Maps don’t bother asking it for directions cause that feature I have yet to see function correctly. Traffic sucks. Basically right now all I use it for is for music control using amazon music. Oh and I can’t forget the most important part. Make sure you have the app open in the background or else or won’t work at all. Honestly if I had not been chosen for the pre release I more then likely would have never bought it after seeing the reviews. I’m honestly thinking about hooking my echo dot back up in the car.

Loved the fact that it allowed me to integrate the Bluetooth iPhone X to my old SUV which had none however the device connects via cable to my current car stereo and for some reason as I drive there is a bad hum that gets worse it’s almost as if the stereo now picks up driving noises. As I accelerate or decelerate or press on the gas peddle you can literally hear it. Weird. I’ll be calling to complain this device wasn’t cheap and I really want it to work smoothly. Adding Alexa functions to the car is great but it’s also problematic for another reason: the Bluetooth stays on when I turn off the car. So I go inside and no calls come in. When ppl say why didn’t you answer me I realized the car is still connected and Bluetooth takes the calls to the car. I’m surprised there’s not a way to fix all this. Hopefully it will be ironed out soon,3,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0
"QUICK TAKE:Like many others, I was on the ""beta"" list for what seemed like a year or more.  In that time the world changed - literally - leaving very little that Echo Auto can do that could not be done as well or better by a modern smartphone and/or your car itself.  On top of that, for a product that was in beta for such an extended period, some really obvious usability issues that could have been fixed were left unfixed.  That is just hard to forgive.  Had they left the product a beta and come out with a new and improved Echo Auto, I would have understood (that is the point to the beta after all) ... but no one ever asked for my feedback as a beta user, and there was in fact no way to submit reviews or feedback - what is the point of the 1 year beta then?",3,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0

"I got this free from my insurance company (Nationwide) as a complete surprise and was a bit ambivalent about it.  I hadn't intended to purchase one, but it did fix an issue we'd been dealing with rather nicely.  We installed bluetooth after factory in a 2019 Town and Country.  It does have an Aux input, but didn't come with Bluetooth.  Unfortunately a few years later, the BT has stopped working reliably, disconnects at unpredictable intervals and as the volume is inconsistent between radio and BT, it is crazy loud and starting, which is not ideal while driving.  Installing the Echo and using the aux port allows seamless syncing again, and the audio is clearer than the after market BT was.  I don't use a lot of the Echo functions but I do occasionally ask it the weather or some bit of trivia which does keep my hands on the wheel more than they might have been.

"Echo Auto is a great idea. I have an older car (2013) that does not have CarPlay or Android Auto built in. The OEM voice commands are terrible, so I was super excited try Alexa in my car, and ultimately reduce the need to use my device to make music and podcast changes while on the road. I am an Amazon Music Unlimited subscriber, so choosing music is pretty easy. There have been issues where Alexa won’t play the right song because I didn’t phrase it correctly (for example try to get Alexa to play the song Breakthrough by The Belonging Co. I actually had to say the word “Co” and not “Company” to get the song to play correctly). I typically use the app Pocket Casts for my podcasts, and the voice commands for Alexa are not intuitive. If you want to replay an episode you’ve already listened to, it required that I go back into the app and put the episode in my Next Up queue.

"I had an Alexa capable product from Indiegogo prior to getting my Amazon Echo Auto but after a system update to my iPhone, it was caput (Plus it never worked as well as this Alexa product... ever!). The install was easy but I had to do some research since my car is 1. older and 2. no with the vents of most family cars. So, after getting my Echo Auto, I purchased two other products: a magnetic stand (on Amazon) and a blue-tooth adapter for my car to work with Alexa through y FM stereo. Once this was done, I had my Alexa!The product works very well with nice recognition and the ability to control my products remotely for home (lights, alarm, etc.) is excellent. I don't like how it takes a little time to reconnect with the network when I leave home but that's the only time I seem to get any hiccup.

"I am kind of an Alexa junkie so I have a lot of different devices.  I think it's pretty cool and helpful, but there are a few quirks I hope Amazon will change.  First, you can't change the wake word like on other devices.  There are frequent radio commercials and discussions where someone says ""Alexa"" and my device responds.  Also, the Alexa sound doesn't come through like a phone call does on the car speakers unless I physically set the sound source in the car to Blue Tooth.  This means if I want to listen to music and be able to talk to my Alexa, I can only do so connected to Blue Tooth sound on an AP on my phone such as iHeartRadio.  So, when a commercial says something like ""just say 'Alexa' tun to Newsradio 610 WIOD on iHeartRadio"", the Echo auto changes to what they said, or tries to perform the action.  Mostly it just results in a pause to my listening, but sometimes if the person speaks too fast it takes me to an odd station and I have to ask Alexa to go back to where I was.  If we could change the wake word, this would go away.  I have 9 Alexa Echo devices in my house but having different wake words on each prevents them from talking back and forth to each other instead of me.  This change would make me give it 5 stars.  Lastly, there should also be a way to change the name of the device.  I have unique names for all my devices to aid in drop ins and such.  Now that my wife wants to carry her Alexa arguments into the car with her own echo auto, I wish I could edit the name to tell them apart easier.  Not a big deal, but would be nice.  Otherwise the device works far better than I thought it would.",4,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"As an early user (I got the invitation) I can confidently state that this device, when combined with a cell company with very good data coverage, an unlimited data plan, and Amazon music unlimited, is pretty amazing. Any song, genre, album, era (i.e. play music from 1969), etc. - any time - almost instantly - hands free.  Send and receive texts, make calls, get directions, and much more - all hands free and almost instantly. I had to switch cell carriers from Sprint to Verizon to get good data coverage in my area. Without good data coverage I encountered numerous dead spots. With good data coverage I have had none. The best carrier depends on where you live, but some have very good data coverage in most areas. A few bugs connecting to the phone, but they are becoming much less frequent. This can be caused by certain phone settings (like data saver mode). It is a data hog so you will want unlimited data or, at least, a high data limit. Good data coverage is essential to enjoy this device, but if you have (or get) that taken care of - you will love it. It is worth changing carriers if necessary to use and enjoy this device. If you enjoy listening to music in your car as much as I do, do yourself a favor and get one of these. It is very cool!",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"I was really looking forward to receiving this--especially after waiting nearly 2(?) years. I probably should have returned this, but I'd like to think an update will come out to make this work better. It seems to connect to my phone fine, I can't really tell how it is connecting to my car via my phone, but I've never had an issue with my phone working in my car before. Now, my amazon music and audible play, then pause every time I start a new play session (device unplayable displays on my car). I can speak to Alexa, but 9 out of 10 times, I can't hear her response. I can't figure out a rhyme or reason for when she works, but she seems to work better when I have music or audible playing (which she will speak over without pausing). This device is very frustrating and I'm really sad, because I like Alexa and have several devices. I rarely give a 1 star review, but after all this time of waiting, I am shocked this thing is so buggy and unusable. I'm grateful I didn't spend more (or I probably would have returned it).",1,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"I was so excited for this product to come out - I was on the waiting list for almost a year. When I received my invite, I got one coming. I had visions of commanding my world while I drove. What I discovered was that this device over-complicated what my smartphone + the Alexa app already did. My car (2014 VW Touareg) did not do well with the latency between the wake word and the car stereo even after adjusting the settings - it made using the device very frustrating.  The cable configuration for the USB and optional AUX audio jack is cumbersome and I never found a good place to locate the device. I already had a vent clip for my phone so I couldn't use the provided mount. It just kind of sat on my dash and slid around when I turned abruptly. It booted up quickly though (when the car would start) and the microphone was in fact very accurate, but at the end of the day it didn't enhance my experience of having an Echo in my car.I once used an Echo Dot + hot spotted to my phone and it actually worked better. The Echo Auto is a ""middle"" device that you don't necessarily need. It's basically a BT microphone and ""wake-word"" listener. If my Alexa app worked with the wake word, it would do everything this device does.",2,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Having an echo in the car is undoubtedly useful. I am now able to ensure that all the house lights are turned off, alarms are set. I can set reminders for myself in the car, which is great, because it's always frustrating to think of something in the car only to forget it after. I have not used it for navigation or music.However, the echo is unbelievably dependent on your car's functionality. Makes sense, because bluetooth can only go so far. But if I'm connected to my car's bluetooth for music, and then to the echo auto, it has a lag. A long lag. In fact, I often get a 3-5 second lag. I drive a Toyota RAV4 2015 model, so not exactly an old car either. It's very annoying to have to wait a bit every single time you use it.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"For 25$ it’s worth a shot for $50, I’d wait for the kinks to be worked out. I spent $25 and overall I like it , I am okay dealing with the quirks, and it’s helpful for my situation. I think Alexa integration will improve (eg: adding sms support), but not sure all of the quirks are fixable.I have an older car, so no CarPlay and voice control seemed like a good workaround. The use cases that I am interested in: play music (Spotify), ask for directions (Waze), call mom, text mom (iMessage). When it works, music and directions work well. Calling sometimes works (the contact linkage to Apple contacts is wonky) and texting via sms is non existent on iPhone (the message indicates sms not currently available).",3,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

Echo Auto has taught me that “Hey Siri” works REALLY well.Update:  There just have been a software update because this thing is now working perfectly 99% of the time and when it does, it’s a Bluetooth issue with the phone and just requires turning the Bluetooth off and then on.

"First off - full disclosure:  I received this item for free.  My Auto Insurance company offered to give me one for free and I took them up on it.  I had looked at these before and decided against buying one because I didn't see a real use for it - for me personally...That said - for free - why not.

"It does what a home Echo Dot does, but the sound fades out often in the middle of playing games and it often has trouble reconnecting to my phone. I don't know if it's losing connection, but it's annoying when the sound goes mute in the middle of a trivia question or whatever. It plays music fine, but I think it's because you are basically streaming from your phone at that point. It will load maps and directions to phone with voice commands.Update 12/23/19 - It's gotten worse...I don't even try anymore. It helped the time pass when traveling, but now I can't play any games because it keeps fading out (buffering I'm assuming). If you tell it to repeat, it will repeat, but who wants to keep doing that repeatedly? It's not my phone, because it streams music & phone calls fine to car's bluetooth. The Echo just can't keep up...maybe it needs more bandwidth that just isn't available when you are not connected to a good source like a home device is.? I was great when it worked, but it's pretty much garbage now. All I use it for now is to pick a station to stream music from using voice instead of having to look at my phone. Once it selects, it's just streaming directly from the phone, so I usually don't have any connection issues.",2,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0

"It’s a cool item to have in the car but didn’t create any major ‘wow’ moments for me. Car already had Bluetooth but Echo Auto couldn’t connect to it the 4-5 times I tried it, may have been the cars’ fault, who knows. Just plugged the supplied cable in the auxiliary port and it works. Every time I turn the car on the phone recognizes and instantly connects to Echo Auto, but once the car Bluetooth becomes enabled, it overrides it, making me need to reselect the Echo Auto (like when selecting wireless headphones/earbuds) in the phone to hear any sound. When streaming YouTube music it can have some millisecond glitches/stutters, but that may be down to YouTube buffering. I was able to set up a routine between my nest and echo auto which was cool, and also drop into my kitchen echo when I was driving, pretty cool also. I would definitely recommend it to someone who has an aux port in their car but no Bluetooth, it’s way better than those cigarette lighter Bluetooth adapter things. Once my house becomes more of a smart house and once Alexa ads some additional functionality, I see this device as being a pretty integral key to the system.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

I really didn’t need anything additionally hanging on my dash!As an update it’s very sluggish and constantly loses its connection along with the correct time and location. Otherwise f you want to use it for music it’s nice WHEN the connection staty active. Using the Alexa app gives you the same thing and you have to open that app anyway.

"Stupid thing won’t connect right. It connected just fine when I first plugged it in via the Bluetooth but my iPhone somehow cancels it out when I sync with my Ford C-Max. So I tried using the USB port which powers it but won’t connect it, which is a major fail on Amazon. I don’t have an aux jack so that didn’t help. I really only got this thing for voice activated directions since I can do that already with the Ford sync, but don’t feel like paying $14.99 a month. My phone can also turn on my Phillips hue lights but the hands free option was also looking appealing but worked only once and stopped. What I don’t understand is that it should be for updating dated cars without the current technology. But you need the current Ford technology to properly work it yet the new tech can just run the Alexa app. Depending on the layout of your car the cords can be a nuisance nuisance. It has a magnetic clip so I’m also wondering if I can get a square sticker so I can stick it on the side of my dash so it’s somewhat organized. I’m really just waiting for a software update.",1,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
I had always wanted Alexa in my car and using the Alexa app wasn't cutting it.  This was exactly what I wanted. You can do almost everything you can do with a normal echo. It uses the internet from your phone.Some drawbacks are that there's a very noticeable delay from the wake word and when she chimes. Also would be nice if it consistently picks up the song or playlist from when you last used it. Right now that feature us little spotty.,5,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"Overall, I have been satisfied to a certain extent with the Echo Auto. Considering, however, that i had waited almost a year for this device i must say that it was underwhelming, the AUX and MICRO USB ports should have been placed on the back of the device and not on the side; this would have prevented the inability to place and hide the chords aas needed dependent upon vehicle..... especially when taking into consideration the fact that the device is intended and directed to be placed upon the center one ones dashboard.As the device is designed for the consumers vehicle, especially a consumer located in the Los Angeles, CA area,  that seamless integration be a must. A deal breaker per say.  Multiple times a day required utilization of my mobile alexa app was needed. often, i would lose connection and while driving or while being stuck in traffic more like it, i would have to log back into my account, wait for pairing and confirmation of my 'BEING A PASSENGER' within my own vehicle. it was often quite frustrating.",3,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0

"I actually like the idea the problem is that it just really doesn't play nicely with the audio system in my car.  It connects just fine to the phone and works perfectly for that but the problem is getting the audio from the car stereo while listening to something like Sirius XM or radio.  Technically it would work perfectly if I wanted to waste my data and stream music from the phone instead of using the cars system.  The problem is that it requires you to have your audio source set to bluetooth or AUX.  This means I can't use it while the car stereo is playing without switching sources which means If I want to listen to music I have to use my phones battery and data up.That said functionally it works fairly well, calling, asking a question, etc work great most of the time but it isn't perfect but still works 99% of the time.  It can easily hear you and never really had any issues even sitting on the dash in the Arizona sun for over a year now.  I was actually surprised how well it held up to the heat.  I stuck it right on the top of my dash in the sun with the velcro tape it came with, sadly mine never came with the vent clip.  Even with the stereo cranked and going 80 down the highway it rarely had any trouble with voice recognition for me.  That said sound quality itself was a bit hit and miss in my experience, the Bluetooth audio quality just isn't that good.",3,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I got this with the purpose of being able to use maps and music even more hands free. However, neither of those two things are possible. I’m not sure what IS possible with this piece of plastic. I continuously try asking Alexa for things while driving, hoping that one day an update might have been done to make it better... no such luck. I ask her to play pandora and she usually “can’t at this time”. When she is successful, she only recognizes playing my very last station. It/she’s too dumb to know any other verbiage than an exact transcript which is nothing like how I or any normal person speaks. I have tried having her play iHeartRadio and she fails to do that. She’s a little better at playing amazon music, but only when she’s actually working/connected? I don’t really know what or why she can’t connect to whatever she needs to connect to to work. You would think that if you ask “Alexa, give me directions to...” that she could pull up your maps app or any maps app and give you directions to an address or nearest gas station, etc. she can’t. She doesn’t know the phrase. What I thought was going to be an awesome car piece is just a waste of money. Makes me glad I never bought into the dot or echo for my home.

"Pros: I got mine as an introductory for $25. Instructions said it would probably not work with my Android Auto, but it does work with it. Super easy to set up.

Just today I took a road trip and was able to listen to my Prime music and get directions at the same time. It told me of upcoming accidents/vehicles on side of road and police speed traps. Several times it will say where and when to turn with names/numbers of roads/highways. It hears and recognizes my voice always.Cons: You have to make sure it is working before you get on the road. Sometimes it will not connect to the phone. Once connected you have to make sure the phone volume is turned up or you can't hear it (turning the volume on your radio will adjust it later).

At first I had some connection challenges and after reading some of the reviews, I was on the verge of returning the device tomorrow, but decided to give it another try.  I followed the instructions to the tee, but made sure my vehicle's radio was connected to the Bluetooth of my cellphone; while using the Alexa app I added a new device under Echo device and selected Echo Auto, once it was connected I made sure I could hear the test sound through my truck's speakers.  Once the sound was confirmed, I was ready to give Alexa commands!  Good luck all.Update, 26 Dec 2019.  I went to use the Alexa Echo Auto device and it's saying unable to connect to my cellphone.

"I use the Echos in my home all day long, to check weather, time, set timers/alarms, and control my smart phone devices.  I thought it would be awesome to add an Echo to my car for the same functionality.  It wasn't.  First, to use the Echo Auto you MUST set your car radio to BlueTooth - this is how the Echo responds to commands.  But this means you can't use your radio for ANYTHING else - for instance, listen to satellite radio, or just your local station.  This is just a huge limitation.  Also, since I must turn the radio volume pretty much all the way up to hear anything over BlueTooth, every time I switch away from BlueTooth I have the frightening experience of being blasted by volume well above comfortable limits.  Perhaps the environment in my car is noisy, but the Echo always had a hard time understanding my requests.  Then, after a couple of weeks, it started having trouble connecting, and somehow got my phone into a state where it was just stuck.  After that I was done.

"So I am baffled by the bad reviews. I think a lot of them were from the testers that tried the early release. they may have had some bugs back then.  I ordered my echo on black friday. I was very hesitant because of the bad reviews but I decided to take a chance. I opened the box plugged my echo device into my wall socket (in my house) connected it to my phone using the Alexa app. I thought that process was easier then my echo and show to be honest. It took less than 3 minutes, including me watching the dorky video. I set it aside then unhooked it to to plug into my car on the way to work.  I plugged it in my car socket, (my phone is already connected to my bluetooth in my car.) And it immediately came on. no problems. I asked it the weather and the time then had it play music from spotify. Then I called a friend. It all worked seamlessly. No hassle no fuss. I didn't try maps or gas stations but I have my work set in my google maps and I just use the GPS for traffic updates. At work I unplugged from the car, just in case of battery issues. After work I hooked it back in.  Alexa connected in seconds. I say if you like Alexa and you already have a phone that connects to bluetooth in your car go for it. It's a great buy. I'll update after a week or 2 to note any changes or after I check a few features. I have a galaxy s10 and a 2009 sonata. Not sure if that matters.

With the iPhone, if the Alexa app keeps searching for the Echo Auto, quit the app and restart the Echo Auto. That worked for me.The Echo Auto works through the bluetooth on your phone so we basically have one for my wife and one for myself. I don't use it for directions, just answering questions and for playing my music. With that, it excels for the most part. I've had issues where I'll be playing some music, get to my location, and turn off the car. When I get back in and start the car, the music is showing that it's playing but I can't hear anything. When that happens, I just tell it to play something else and the new music starts playing again just fine. There were a few times yesterday on a long ride that it would just stop playing after a song (usually after a phone call) but telling it to play again worked.

The only issue is the put a rubber wire holder on the front side of the mount which would be a nice way to help tuck the wires but when I ran my wires through the holder within an hour the glue that holds the rubber to the mount came off so the wires went back to dangling. The back side of the mount has threaded rod going through to hold it in place.

NOT like having a stand alone echo dot. If you want to listen to Amazon content for an extended time, Audible on a long trip for instance, this would be useful, otherwise its a novelty.  I could get similar functionalty by hooking up my smartphone via auxillary or bluetooth to my car speakers.  It also has to be plugged in at all times, another cord muddling up the dash. Not sure its worth it.",4,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"Letting the Alexa app run in the background appears to murder my phone's battery (Android). Asking for things nearby doesn't really provide the desired results in most cases.  Other Alexa functions seem fine, such as playing stuff from Spotify, although it behaves differently than an Echo.  Echo Auto will use the spotify account on the phone to stream, not the one connected in the Alexa app.  This is probably a benefit if you've sacrificed one account of a family plan as a designated Alexa account, as you will not interrupt the stream of a person playing music at home.The 12v socket on my car, without rewiring things, is always on.  The Echo Auto is unlikely to quickly drain the car battery, but my phone remains paired with it in the office and at home, so I must manually unplug the device when I reach my destination.  This isn't the Echo Auto's fault, but is definitely something that you should be mindful of.",2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Had this since the invite release.  I use the AUX jack because I do not have Bluetooth in my car.  My system during release did not get an air vent holder, it came with a sticker magnet for the dashboard.  Sometimes it will speed up or slow down the song based on internet connectivity.  It will also skip and pick back up when the internet connection drops.  Really good for long car rides as long as you did not use up all your 4g.  Went on a nice road trip to New Orleans and it worked all the way down and back for music and pretty good for navigation.  Also worked well with Google Maps.  My child love it too and we listen to Disney music on short rides and Alexa can hear her from the back seat.  Alexa Auto can be just as persnickety as its sister Home Devices.  If it's not an internet issue it's her not listening when she is supposed to.The Auto power cord is also really good too when not using for the AlexaAuto, it can charge your phone pretty fast in a short 15 min ride.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I'm not sure why people are giving the echo auto such bad reviews. I found it to be easy to set up and easy to use. I already had the alexa app which made things a bit easier I suppose. I plugged it in and alexa walked me through the setup. I dont have any issues with losing connection. Each time I get in the car it's just a few simple and all my amazon music is available. Now if you are an audiophile the sound reproduction may not meet your standards but it satisfies my needs. I listen to alot of acoustic music and I find it to be bright and clear. I would give it an 8 out of 10. My single biggest complaint is how my echo was shipped. You would think that a semi delicate electronic device would be worth shipping in a box but no, amazon saw fit to send it in a jiffy mailer. The device's box which is a flimsy sort of cardboard was totally crushed. Looked like it had been through hell. Not the type of quality presentation I've become accustomed to with amazon. Luckily everything inside was unharmed and worked well. Amazon please reconsider some of your shipping standards. It doesn't instill confidence in you customers to receive a new release product like this so carelessly packaged.",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I really love Alexa, I have one in each room, I use it for reminders, alarms, music, phone calls, tv, and now car.What I think it needs to improve on: You have to almost shout for it to hear you.

"Edit: Echo Auto, you just lost your second star. Total garbage. There is no way to make Alexa stop playing whatever she is playing i.e. ""Alexa, stop playback"" or fill in the last word with anything you think makes sense. Again, it's pathetic. Amazon owes anyone a discount on the 2nd gen whenever that comes out. Better yet, a free trade in.Where to begin... I'll  keep it short and simple. You'd think after the 5 month delay for the general public to purchase they would've sorted out some obvious glitches  but alas they didn't. I can't imagine it being any worse unless it just didn't work at all",1,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"When it works it's great. But unfortunately it doesn't work most of the time. Constantly receiving echo has disconnected from the Alexa app error message at least 7 out of 10 times.

"I travel for work every week - and get a new full-featured car every week.  The problem is when I get back home, I have a 15 year old vehicle that barely has an AM/FM radio.  (Shocker, it does have an AUX Audio Jack.)  I was excited about being able to listen to my Amazon Music in my Car - and also accessing apps like TuneIn.  I have a late model iPhone.When I finally got the Echo Auto, I paired it with my device in my office in just a minute.  When I went out to my car, it re-paired instantly (and the vent clip worked well for me).  It's not perfect, but it can hear me even with the windows rolled down.  The connection is generally good - but it has dropped out on me a few times - and occasionally I need to open my Alexa app to get it to re-pair.  (That said, I have never had to re-program it.)  I don't talk on the phone much from the car - but the hands-free calling worked well (and helps me keep my hands off the phone while in the car).",5,1,2019-10-16,1,1,0
"I managed to snag one through an invite to buy. Easy to setup, not a bad looking device, a little big. The voice recognition is very hit or miss. The audio output is good but nothing but negative feedback from people on the other end of a voice call. The lack of physical buttons for answering and ending a call are a deal breaker. Way to awkward to have to say “ Alexa, answer the phone” when I could just tap a button without taking my eyes from the road. Same button should be used for pausing and starting audio. Again puling up to a drive through and saying “Alexa, pause music” is too awkward. I don’t see what this offers over smaller, Bluetooth devices and Siri. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not an Alexa hater, I have an echo is just about every room of the house. This just isn’t a good product. Oh, and it can’t stand up to the Texas summer temps inside the car. It won’t work until the inside cools off. I went back to using a generic bt + audio out device that’s been in my car for a couple of years.",2,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"First, I have issues with the sound in my car.  Maybe it is just my car (2012 Honda Pilot).  I knew it wouldn't be compatible with bluetooth, but I wired it to the sound system, which usually works (it works with my mp3 players, USB drives, etc).  But this doesn't work that way.  If your car cannot bluetooth to anything besides a phone, then it is useless. I waited too long to send it back.  Guess I'll give it away or something. It is annoying, too, because even if you have it wired, you have to bluetooth it to your phone.  Then, if you get a call, you can't answer on Alexa and you can't call out on Alexa either - I tried speakerphone and that didn't work.  All around annoying.  Too many workarounds and I couldn't figure out how else it could help me.  Maybe I could tell it to turn on my lights at home before I got there but that's about it.  I have navigation on both my phone and car so don't need any Alexa help for that.  Nope, I am not a happy camper.",1,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"This is a great option for people with older model vehicles that don’t have Bluetooth connections by default. We put this in my husbands truck and it’s been a nice hands free addition for him. I like that it came in box is minimal for less waste. It’s also small so it doesn’t take up a lot of space which is nice but the plug wiring probably could’ve been designed better. Only a few complaints. First being is that there’s a lot of feedback when using the Bluetooth feature for phone calls because the air vent clip puts the Alexa right next to the speaker on his truck. Personally, I think a windshield mount option would make all the difference to make it perfect! Second, the USB Charger feels really cheap, just like the $3 ones you buy at the gas station that only last a few months. Third, the design of the Alexa itself sitting on the mount isn’t very secure and falls off quite often because as we all know, gravity is irrelevant inside of a vehicle lol. Fourth, after connecting my phone to it, every time he pulled into the driveway my phone would automatically connect to it. I would ask Alexa to disconnect my phone to prevent it and she would respond “i can’t do that” so i would have to ask her to forget my phone entirely in order to prevent losing my audio any tome my husband came home, and reconnect to Alexa on the weekends when we drive together. All-in-all, we like it and would buy again. Just A needs to iron out a few wrinkles.",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,1
"First of all, I like it. Connecting it was easy and once paired with my phone I have been able to jump from car to car without having to set it up over and over.  If you are the type of person who uses their phone connected to the car all the time then Echo Auto will be perfect for you.  If you tend to switch back and forth between radio and other options just know Echo Auto only works when your phone is connected to the car or the car unit is set to AUX if you are using the audio jack.  Sound quality is great and it really can hear you over the noise.  I have tried it in three vehicles now and even in my very loud old 4x4 Alexa responded each and every time.  There have been a few times when she did not quite understand me but overall impressive.  I did not try the navigation feature but being able to switch from SIRUSXM to Amazon music to anything else supported by Alexa was very simple. I'm still playing with it,  wish there was a way to access it when I listen to regular radio but I am probably one of the few who actually listen to FM in my car these days.  My only real issue was mounting the unit.  One of the vehicles I used has vents that are not compatible with the mount and the other vehicle had issues as it is older and the vents can't really support the weight of the unit.  I would hope Amazon is coming up with other ways to mount it, as I find that to be one of the more frustrating issues (first world problems).",4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Have had an echo dot in my vehicles for over a year - connected to mobile hotspot.

Have had to cycle power to device before it will operate correctly, 2)  Struggled with BT connection to phone and vehicle (2011 MDX) - my other vehicles all require use of AUX input, so I end up always connecting with aux input and have had no issues, 3) have experienced engine noise coming through audio in at least one vehicle - a ground loop isolator (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HJ35F2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) solved the issue.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0

"I submitted for an invitation as soon as it was announced. It took a solid year before my invitation came, and then it was only about two weeks before general release. So they really didn't want feedback. I believe in the Alexa-verse with an echo dot, echo spot, fire tv devices, echo buttons and an echo plus controlling my music, doors, television and cams. I've never had a problem with installation, set up or functionality. Until the echo auto. As other reviews have mentioned, it's reliance on the Alexa app being open hinders its functionality and ease of use. It got to the point where I was having to delete the device and reconnect it for almost every car trip if I wanted to use it. I could see it's usefulness on a longer car trip or commute, but for a short to average commute, directions or other information,it was easier and safer to use either the in-car navigation system or my phone. I'm hopeful the connectivity and functionality improve greatly, then it may be a useful tool. For now, it's a dashboard ornament with a pretty LED light.",2,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I was thinking I would love this thing so much. I am super into tech stuff and I love my echos in my house. I just don't totally see the point of this. I already have blue tooth in my car to make calls and get texts and listen to music. I do have to select music on my phone, but then again this Alexa won't even play music if your not in service. Also, I believe it uses a lot of data, I have limited data so I am not really into using this a bunch. The chords are obnoxious, they run right down the middle of my dashboard. At the end of the day, I am not sure that even at the discounted price that this is worth it. I am sending both of mine back. Maybe if they really improve it, but I doubt it, because the data thing is a real deal breaker. When I listen to amazon music in my car, I listen to my offline music, and I have even had issues with that, I don't know that I need another item that will just have issues. I do love the plus and regular echo I have in my house though.",2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"If you are used with Alexa system and has used multiple smart devices, then this device is a no brainer. You can control your house from your car as well now. Tell Alexa to start turning on devices at home as you are getting close by, it can do that. Telling Alexa to open/close your locks/door, it can do that. So it really feels like taking your personal assistant into your car.But.... The connectivity is quite pathetic. Alexa is connected to your phone using Bluetooth, and you have an option to either connect the sound of Alexa auto through your phone using Bluetooth to your car, or directly from Alexa to an aux port in your car. BUT!!! if you use the aux port, sometimes Alexa will think that the Alexa itself is another Bluetooth device connected to your phone, and it will try to send out the audio to that device. But because Alexa auto can't receive audio signal, the phone ended up playing the audio using its speaker. This is dumb, stupid and utterly unacceptable. Alexa auto should be smart enough to not be recognized as potential audio Bluetooth device",2,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0

"I was excited when I got notified that I could purchase this for a cheaper price through an invitation to buy as I have a few Amazon products at home (2 Echo Dots, Echo Show).  It was easy to install and connect.  I subscribe to Spotify and I really wanted a way to play my music without fidgeting with my phone while driving, as I am on the road a lot.  This is perfect.  I also have used it to let me know where the nearest gas stations were.  It has been a little glitchy at times--not being able to hear with windows down, ignoring me for a couple minutes, but nothing that super annoyed me.  My biggest complaint would be the mounting clip that came with it.  It fell apart (the silicone cord holder came completely off/unglued).  It's fine, as that made it more bulky in my car anyway.  I mounted it under the drivers side dash/near where my knees are when driving.  I have a little netted pocket there so it worked out perfect.

"I've been a big fan of all the different Echo devices and the usefulness of Alexa on those variety of devices, but almost every review I read prior to buying this was scathing at worst and mixed at best. But I knew a friend who had one so I asked her how it worked and if she liked it and her positive experience with months of active use was enough for me to go ahead and order one of these for my niece for Christmas since earlier in the year we were talking and she mentioned that her car didn't have bluetooth or any sort of smart features, but with this all you need is your phone and an aux port in your car along with a place to plug in the usb power from the echo auto(it comes with everything you need). Fired it up after mounting it and it worked perfectly, connected it to a variety of her accounts (Apple music, etc) and she's used it without any issues since Christmas day. As a side note, I also enabled the skill ""Damn girl"" which gives some great compliments whenever you say ""Damn Girl"" which works great for both women and men as well.Overall I give this my highest recommendation but with the caveat that you actually need to do some proper research to make sure it will be compatible with your specific vehicle as that seems to be the main hurdle to get everything working optimally.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

The power cord comes with little clips that allows you to clip the audio cable with it to allow for a clean integration.

Regardless, the Echo allowed me 1 command then disconnected & required a restart of the app/car to use again. Needless to say, this makes it effectively useless.I have Bluetooth in my car, but it only works for using the phone, not for audio. I bought another Bluetooth receiver that bypassed that issue & I figured this had the same style of bypass.

"So I have many Echo devices in my house that I am happy with and I enjoy using Alexa. I was excited to see Echo Auto, a product that would make Alexa easier to use from the car, and make it so I didn't need to rely on Siri on my phone anymore. Sadly, this product ain't it. Or not yet anyway - it needs a lot more work. The product uses the Alexa app on your phone to do the heavy lifting - this thing doesn't actually do much more than provide a glorified microphone for the mobile Alexa app. Yes it can wake up the app on your phone for you (when it works), but it fails so often that it's not worth it.It's flaky and fails frequently to hear me. Here I am inches from the mike and I'm yelling trying to get Alexa to respond. Not good. I think sometimes it can't wake up the Alexa app on the phone. Even worse, however, is that Alexa seems to lose her connection to the internet frequently - even when other  apps on my phone continue to function. This is likely a problem with the Alexa app rather than Echo Auto, but it doesn't matter, as Echo Auto requires the Alexa app to work. If I go through a patch of bad cell coverage, Alexa is awful at finding the signal again once it's strong - sometimes I have to force-quit the Alexa app on the phone and relaunch it to get it to connect again.",1,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Before I purchased the Echo Auto, I had another Alexa device in my car that worked pretty well.

"Not really worth even the discounted price if you own a smartphone, which I assume you do because you need to to use it. Using Google assistant (and I'd imagine Siri) is way simpler than teaching this thing every skill it needs to function even half as well. It has a hard time giving me directions to anything, simply telling me it can't find directions to where I'm asking to go, and even when it acts like it's about to it never seems to open Google Maps. A simple ""Ok Google, directions to _____"" on the other hand, works every single time. Despite all the mics, it has a hard time understanding simple commands to play certain bands like ""Play songs by Pulp on Spotify"" that Google Assistant has no issue carrying out for me. Also, when I'm already playing music through Spotify it just straight up ignores any command I give to change what I'm listening to on Spotify. There's simply no reason to use this thing if you have google assistant on your phone (and I imagine Siri as it has always worked flawlessly any time I've used it) especially if your car supports Bluetooth. The only reason I could see bothering with this device over is not wanting an Aux chord plugged into your phone if you don't have Bluetooth in your vehicle. Amazon hasn't even bothered trying to match the bar set by Google and Apple with this hunk of plastic. The only thing I liked about this device that my phone couldn't already do without it is hands-free dropping in on my other Alexa-enabled devices.TL;DR: Before wasting your time with this device, connect your phone to bluetooth (or to an AUX cable) and try using your google assistant (""Ok Google"") or Siri out the same way first. Unless you're so wrapped up in the world of Amazon that conectivity between your car and your Amazon devices matters to you, your phone already does everything this thing does, hands-free, better.",2,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0

And I can ask for any song and it hasn’t let me down yet, it’s plays right through my car stereo.Now one reason I might be having better luck with this than others could be the way my car is set up.

But if for instance you had a nice party speaker, you could totally use this and a phone to turn it into an alexa enabled device. All it needs is usb power. And since the music is actually playing through your phone,  not the device itself, anything your phone can connect to, it can connect to. It even has an aux out built in just in case you want the device plugged into the aux instead of your phone. It works so seamlessly and perfectly.

Set up is simple and if you've ever set up an Echo in your home or just have moderate instruction following capabilities, Alexa will be granting your wishes in 5 minutes, tops!  Major plus - I can tell Alexa to remind me that I need coffee creamer so I don't get all the way home after work, ready for my 6 o'clock coffee and decompress, only to find it'll be a bitter black cuppa this evening. I can tell Alexa to find the most random Irish girl band pop song from 1998 (C'est La Vie by B*Witched, FYI) and she is on it. I can tell her to call my husband, send that text message I've forgotten to respond to for 2 days, and tell me a really good joke... all while never taking my eyes off the road or hands off the wheel. I admit I thought Alexa in cars was silly, but this is a game changer.

Having the cords hanging across your dash is kind of unsightly. If there were a few different mounting options I think it'd be easier to live with for a lot of people.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,1
"First, I have an older SUV so was really excited to get my invite to buy Echo Auto for hands free navigation and all the Alexa capabilities. I didn't have any trouble setting it up out of the box and was impressed with how it worked; quizzing her, asking for specific songs, and starting navigation. I love checking the forecast on my way to work or just being able to ask random questions that pop into my mind.I could use the vent clip, but don't like how visible that makes it in my car, so I keep it more hidden below my dashboard. After some experimenting have found a good location where it hears me best.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I have an 04 Mini Cooper that is the car I wanted when I was younger, but there was no way I could afford it at the time. Because it was something I wanted back in the day, I wanted to keep this car as close to how it would have looked/been back in the day. I wanted to keep the factory radio to maintain the look and feel so I can pretend it's 2004 and I'm still in my early 20's. I also didn't want to give up the CD changer. The car doesn't see a lot of use, but I wanted to add handsfree functionality to the car for when I take it out and need to make a call or want to listen to music that's on my phone.The Echo Auto seemed like the perfect solution - it doesn't take up much space and plugs into the aux jack of the car while providing me with hands free capabilities for my cell phone, navigation, and audio streaming. When I added it to the car, I was still living in Florida where you always have cellular data. It was fantastic.",3,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Updated, I’m now able to play Amazon  music or any source on my phone and have it automatically resume. I still can’t use radio sources such as SeriusXM, CD, FM while using Alexa. As there are apps, this pretty much resolves my primary concern.The biggest issue is to have Alexa available, you can’t use any other source (CD, Radio, iPod, phone, USB). When you start the car, Alexa takes a while to work, and doesn’t resume what was playing. So every time you start the car, you spend several minutes before you can listen to music again and have to ask again to play something. If you don’t connect Alexa to your car stereo via Bluetooth, you really can’t hear her. I enjoy having access to Alexa, information, orders, Amazon music,etc, just not sure it’s worth the trade off day to day. Alexa needs to work like my cell phone does for phone calls, and be able to mute the radio source to answer, but not be the primary audio source unless playing music. If you are playing music, it needs to resume where you left off when you start the car, and quickly.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,1
"I have 3 Echos in my house and I love them. I wanted to love this but it's just pointless. It only works if your phone is nearby and unlocked and on the Alexa app. I wanted to use this to listen to music and do other stuff while still using my phone but I can't. The Echo Auto takes over your phone and uses it for everything. So at that point I have to ask, why? Why wouldn't I just use my phone then? If I have to have my phone unlocked and turn off my auto lock with the Alexa app open, why do I even need this? I'll just use the app and get literally the exact same experience minus the extra cords and awkward mounting device. Why not just include adhesive so I can put it wherever I want if I don't want it right in my face on the dash? Oh I know why, because it can't hear you if its not right in front of your face. So AGAIN, why wouldn't I just use my phone that's already mounted in front of my face? It makes no sense at all no matter how you look at it. Returning mine.",1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"Okay, Here's a device that I did not buy for myself, I received it as a gift. I really wasn't going to spend my own money, as I didn't think it was much more than having Alexa on my phone, and I was pretty much right.

"I thought it was a good idea to be able to listen to various genres in my vehicle with just a voice command. No more searching through CDs trying to find something to listen to. So far, it hasn’t worked as well as I hoped.I set this up in my home instead of sitting in a hot car (just use a USB plug and a speaker using AUX), then I went & plugged it in my car and it came right on. Which means the Echo Auto can also be used in the house; not just in a vehicle.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,1
"This device has allowed me to play music via bluetooth in my 2013 automobile. However, there are a few issues:- my car has handsfree bluetooth already, so sometimes using google maps or calls makes the whole system wonky and needs a reset from my phone or something similar. It doesnt always do this, but sometimes it freaks out.",3,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"We love our Alexa in the house - we have a main unit in the living room and dots scattered throughout the house, and absolutely love the way it allows us to access all of our Prime features from anywhere. The ability to add the car to that collection has been a fantastic thing, allowing us to maximize  the ability to listen to music, check the news,  access reference information, and add things to list on the go as well as at home. The ability to make announcements, letting everyone know when someone is coming home, is very helpful at dinner time. And there are so many new skills and games added, that it gives the kids something to do in the car as well as the adults on long road trips.The only negative ties in to the connectivity to the phone. Since Alexa in the car realize on phone cell service for connection, if you live in rural areas - as we do - where there are occasional dead zones or flat spots, sometimes the service is not available or will cut out. These areas are few and far between, but it is an interruption in service - sometimes with funny return results, as the voice will be drawn-out or a song slowed until it sounds silly upon the return of connectivity. It's a minor issue, and when we deal with in all areas that rely on wireless connection, so it is not a big deal. But it is literally the only issue we have had so far, and since it is a manageable one, we cannot say enough good things about Alexa Auto!",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I was worried about the connection issues others had spoken of but it really was simple and worked flawlessly on my Motorola Z2 Force.Right after placing the order for the Echo Auto, I downloaded the Alexa and music apps and connected them to my account.  When I got the device I made one mistake and that was powering it up first which really wasn't a problem its just that it kept telling me to connect it to the Alexa app.  I opened the Alexa app, went to devices, clicked the PLUS in the top right corner, scrolled down to Amazon Echo Auto and pressed it.  It said searching.  I powered up the Echo Auto and in a split second I was connected.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,1
"I had often dreamed of having a voice assistant in the car, mostly to answer questions that arise, as I often use my home Amazon Alexa for doing.  I am finding this Alexa less useful and here is why:  I also pay for satellite radio because I enjoy much of the programming I can hear while driving.  But for my car's audio system I can either choose to listen to satellite radio at my figure tips OR choose to have this Alexa active because to use Alexa my car tuner must be tuned into Bluetooth and not satellite radio.So, if I only want to stream audio or play of my playlist, then I can tune into Alexa.  But if I want to listen to satellite programming, I cannot get help from Alexa.  I did not consider this before buying, not that it would have stopped me.  There are times when I don't listen to satellite radio and make use of my car's Alexa.  But even then, there is the issue of connecting Alexa to my phone's Bluetooth, sometimes fiddling with the Alexa app or Amazon Music app I use, and currently Alexa for the car seems determined to only play my daughters Alexa playlist and plays it whether I want it or not.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"This was very easy to setup and install. It takes slightly longer for a response than my indoor devices but does almost everything the other devices can except set alarms.It usually connects instantly and automatically, but it sometimes has trouble connecting, and occasionally never connects during my 5-20 minute drive. Then it’ll prompt me to open the app on my phone. This happens sporadically, so I haven’t figured out what triggers it, but I suspect it’s my phone. I’m using an iPhone and there have been a few updates over the past few weeks, and I had issues with bluetooth auto connecting for other apps after each update. I also have an older iPhone (7+), so there may be issues with its outdated bluetooth technology itself and being connected to multiple devices at the same time (this plus my car, fitbit, and a headset), but it does work the majority of the time.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,1
"The actual Alexa voice functionality is fine. However the Bluetooth connectivity and the reliability of the Echo Auto leave much to be desired.Ideally, it should work in such a way that you get in your car, turn the car on, then tell it what you want and it just works.

"Really like to use the ECHO AUTO #2 for receiving/ending hands-free calls, requesting music, directions, answering trivia, and checking my schedule. Integrates great with my car stereo. I have a 2012 Ford Taurus SLE (base model car) with a separate FM and aux-input buttons. This makes it easy to switch inputs.  I recommend it to everyone with an Amazon prime account.There are some quirks that the next iteration could address. Not having internal bass or treble controls. At max volume, the Echo Auto, is a hair quieter than the factory stereo sound.  It means when switching from the cars stereo to the aux input (ECHO), you have to raise the volume 1 'click'.  The opposite is true; when switching from ECHO AUTO to FM, I have to lower the volume to compensate.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,1
"It took a while for me to get it (they don't ship this directly to Guam) and I must say that this is a good start but I do hope that some major upgrades are coming.  For now, it's more of a glorified version of a new car's bluetooth system.  Despite that, it's still cool to have Alexa on the go.Here are a also few things that I noticed:",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,1
"Set up for this device is really easy,  so that’s a good thing because by the third and fourth time you have to do it you’ll be a pro.I was excited to get the invitation for this product what seems like a year ago. When the unit arrived, it was much smaller than I expected, which is a good thing because you will want to be able to tuck it somewhere rather than use the vent clip. The vent clip however is rather large and makes a nice looking, little device, look awful.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,1
"So I wanted to use it a few times before giving a review. I am a fan. Biggest reason is because I am not a fan of the radio. In the car I listen to playlists or XM. At home I tend to listen to Amazon music most. I have long commutes sometimes and countless times I had a song pop into my head I would have liked to play, but obviously while driving that’s not an option. (Not for me anyways, not worth taking my eyes off the expressway at high speed) The first time I used it I had directions on my phone going and music playing through the Echo Auto, then a phone call came in. I don’t remember exactly what happened, but it was chaos. I turned off the Echo and was trying to figure out how they all work together.  Well, I have used it again without directions, or a phone call and it works great without interruptions. I have had echos around my house since they came out, and I always wished to be able to have that access when it’s most important to be hands free. I will try it a bit longer and if I feel this review needs an update I will be back. My only complaint are the wires... I know it’s not an option right now for wireless, but I’m a clean cut look kinda girl, when my charger isn’t in use it’s tucked away, so having this wire string down the front of my car drives me nuts.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,1
"Meh.  Wait til a few generations have been made.  All relies on the quality of your car speakers.  Relies on your smart phone and any apps you have on it, which must be turned on and plugged in to car when in use.  Relies on Alexa app. Which also must be on.  Internet? Have your phone with you.  Clip for attachment is poorly constructed, but on its own it’s a small and unobtrusive unit.  Don’t move your hand too quickly or you’ll pop the (magnetic) Alexa device off the (poorly constructed, see above) clip. At least it comes off easy for the glove compartment (as if anyone would steal it).  Must be plugged in to car’s WiFi/adaptor.  All in all, I’m talking to my phone. That just adds to the Cord Situation in a car.  ITS JUST A MICROPHONE PROPLE.  It may or may not use your Spotify/pandora/etc streaming service even if you tell it to.  Won’t work in. In-urban areas if you rely on WiFi for info (“Alexa, give me directions to...”...wel you better confirm on your own app first).

"What a great device! I purchased as early as I could when Amazon announced they were releasing it. I use it in my 07 Tacoma that has the original ""Old School"" factory audio system. The Echo Auto plugs into the Aux Input on the Toyota's radio and connects to my iPhone via Bluetooth and that is it. Most of the time I leave my phone in my pocket and do nothing other than starting my truck and driving away. I say"" Alexa play 70's Rock and it plays. (I do subscribe to Amazon Unlimited Music so I can listen to anything I want and create playlists etc) If a song comes on that I don't like I simply tell Alexa and it is not played again. If a song plays that I like I ask Alexa to save it to my liked list.  ""Alexa play my likes""  I love it!  If my phone rings I say""Alexa answer the phone"" and all I do is speak and listen through the trucks speakers.

"Initially I had a ton of trouble keeping it connected. In fact, it would cause my phone to disconnect from my car's bluetooth so I couldn't even use non-Alexa stuff (like my audiobook). I had to delete and reinstall the Alexa app and redo the sync and the connection issues are gone.The biggest problem, though, is the voice recognition. If you play any games that require answers, like the Jeopardy one, be prepared for her to miss an answer often, even when you say the exact correct answer.",2,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Loving this thing so far.  Besides the Alexa integration, it also makes any dumb-simple car Bluetooth-enabled.  I have a 2010 odyssey with a CD player and Aux input and an iPhone 8.  When I have a call or music streaming on my Bluetooth headset getting in the car, the audio automatically switches to the car audio.  If I make a call, I’m basically already on hands-free speakerphone.I have tested the sound recognition with the windows open and closed, and with the Echo located in different positions, and I’m generally happy with the results.  Yes, if you have the windows down and/or you’re on a concrete surface, you may have to speak up and enunciate.  It still seems pretty impressive to me.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,1
"I mostly bought this to help with hand-free music, among other things. Unfortunately, I am underwhelmed. It does hear you over music and it does do several of the classic Amazon apps, such as reminders, but it doesn't recognize some of the other apps - stating you need to add them on your Alexa app (again). It's not very useful when asking to search for places, it seems to only be able to tell you where the nearest gas station or grocery store is. Good luck asking for something specific, it wouldn't hear you correctly anyway.Additionally, the very long cord from the Alexa to a USB port is messy and isn't aesthetically pleasing. It comes with a little knob that 'holds' the cord to make it less manageable and less messy, however, it fell off about two-weeks in. As far as staying in your air vent, which I immediately hated because hot air coming out of the vent will surely degrade the device and will have to replace sooner (so if you buy, I strongly recommend buying an extended warranty/protection plan), I would say it's secure unless the slightest bump on it will dislodge it.",3,1,2019-12-4,1,0,1

In fact, every time my iPhone updates, Echo Auto then has to get integrated again.  So frustrating.Echo Auto can only find the nearest X (fast food chain) but if you ask her for a major store, she finds you one way further than the closest.

"I am not sure why people rate this so low. My car is before market, no Bluetooth or aux just a CD player. The biggest asset is the ability to play music without fumbling with my phone. Pandora, prime, and virtually every other Amazon connected app. Navigation is terrible because it will not take you anywhere without confirmation on your phone but that is minor for me. Voice recognition is horrible, it does not hear you in wind or loud background noises. I find myself screaming more times than I want to. And if the volume is high you likely will have to turn down for the echo to hear you. Again, minor as I have adapted. It relies solely on Bluetooth connection from your phone good luck in areas with no internet connection. Again, minor for me as I have adapted.To sum, this device is not for you if you have a car that is after market. Especially cars within the last 2 years. But, for older model cars, it's nice inexpensive upgrade. For record, I have a 2009 mitsubishi galant.",4,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"Waited over a year for this, and I am not disappointed.  This echo auto came with a vent holder for the car, and it works great with my 2016 KIA Soul Plus.  The navigation integration isn't exactly perfect yet, and I have had enough trouble that I don't count on it for that for at least right now.  The Amazon Music, podcasts, News, response to Alexa questions, phone calls, etc is just awesome.  I really love it and use it every day.  The calendar function works after it is enabled on Alexa, but it seems to quit working and needs to be enabled repeatedly.  The device also claims to lose connection to my Alexa app somewhat frequently, which is the main reason I quit using the Navigation!  It will attempt to start WAZE on my phone, but I need to go to my phone to press START to get the Navigation to begin.

"As far as I can tell, the only benefit of this device is that you don't have to take your phone out of your pocket.

This is by far the worst, the hardest to set up, and the advertising is a little deceiving.  Pretty technically apt, and have never had any real issues setting up any Amazon Device, or any of the other vast selection of Smart devices I own.First off, while my 2013 Pilot will accept a connection from my phone Bluetooth, and play music bluetooth, this device only works Auxiliary.  Which I knew this when I bought it, as my vehicle was listed as one that only does auxiliary.  2nd, if you follow the prompts and answer the question correctly about whether you use Bluetooth for phone calls, it wont even set up and recognize the device and complete the installation.

I have a 2011 Hyundai and currently use a Samsung Galaxy 7 (albeit with extensive security). Every time, I leave the car, the system does not reconnect upon re-entering. I have to unplug the device from the car, restart alexa, and reconnect the device. The car bluetooth system does not recognize the Echo Auto so I have to use the auxiliary input yet the car says that bluetooth integration is available. I have tried enabling streaming from the phone to no avail. Geez, I even looked at the car owners manual!The Echo Auto sound is only as good as your car system and I think it is pretty good. The voice recognition is about as good as alexa devices.",2,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0

One thing I was certain about was that I did NOT want to use the air vent mount.  So, I decided to try it out with it sitting in my cup holder.After setting it up, I tested it while driving.  Alexa recognized me speaking and the voice recognition worked very well.  I've always loved streaming music and how it handles different playlists.  But, the kicker was when I decided to see if Alexa could call people on my phone.  It was a blind test and I was super-excited to find that it worked perfectly.  Additionally, I can ask how long it will take me to get home (or any destination) by simply asking while I'm driving!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"I’ve been using this product for about a month. Setting it up was a bit confusing. I followed the instructions but it didn’t work the first time. I followed the instructions to start over and they didn’t work. When I went to the step where you open the app, all I had was a message that said “do not use while driving” and would not let me do anything. Even though I was parked in my driveway. So I gave up for the day. When leaving work the 2nd day, I asked it a question and it actually just worked! I don’t know what I did but perhaps it was set up before and I just couldn’t hear? I also had a hard time seeing the colors of the lights in the Florida sunlight.I think I found the culprit tho. Leaving work, I’m not connected to WiFi but leaving home I am, so I believe it has some issue with switching from WiFi. If I remember to turn WiFi off in my phone before getting in the car, it works fine. Hopefully they can fix this.

I bought this device to try for a wireless connection and to have the additional functionality of Alexa.When it works, it is wonderful.  It allows you use the device as if it were an Echo device in your home.  It allows you to play music, have it read books and control all the Caseta light switches and other IoT items running in your home.  When driving in remote areas with abysmal radio choices, your music preference is met and in that way it is superior to satellite radio, CD's or USB drives.

"Mounted and functioned generally as billed.  I have mine set up with audio cable to aux input on car stereo.  It later occurred to me that unless I am missing something I am not really getting much of anything by having the Echo Auto.  I have the Amazon Music app on my iPhone and I can enable Alexa to work with that app so simply mounting my phone on the vent with the MPow magnetic phone mount, which I have, and which the Auto also uses a version of, then o can use Alexa commands, at least for music and streaming already.  You have to have the Alexa app itself open (in background is fine) for Auto to function anyway (Auto just connects to phone via Bluetooth) so really, “What’s the point?”  And despite having setting such that Auto is not supposed to handle my calls on my iPhone Auto still seems to cause Bluetooth to always pick up my calls.

It will switch my audio books on demand, read my Kindle books aloud while I'm driving, and it gives me the news whenever I want it.

"I got this as part of a select few who were invited to try it out before being released to everyone. Before this, I tried putting an Echo Dot in my car and using it with my phone which was a headache since it had to connect to my phone's mobile data. With this, it connects automatically through bluetooth when you start your car so essentially you are using your phone, but this product is the microphone and speaker.The sound quality isn't that great so you definitely need to use your vehicle's radio as the output. As for how well it works, it works the same as any other Echo device in your house. The main problem is that the microphones can't hear you too well over road noise which is a problem for even my car's built in voice recognition. If you are a loud talker then it should be fine, otherwise you can only really use it when you are stopped. I have it on my instrument cluster so it's pretty close to me. Having a wire constantly plugged in for power is a bit messy, but I suppose it's better than having to change batteries all the time.",4,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"I was lucky enough to be able to purchase one of these pursuant to an invitation.  I am very happy.  The device is shipped with a separate vent mount and alternatively a adhesive label type mount.  I used the latter in my old Mercedes which has very few dash surfaces where adhesive will stick.  I was fortunate that the small form factor allowed me to mount it very conveniently.  The device comes with a 3.5mm cord for auxiliary sound input which is unnecessary if your phone can connect to your car stereo by way of bluetooth.The Echo Auto seems to be very different from other Echo products in one major respect.  It's basic functionality is by way of the Alexa app on your phone.  It is your phone which provides both the internet connection and the bluetooth connection to your car stereo.  This has the advantage of preserving all of your existing telephone functionality, including hands free calls.

"I’ve thought forever that the most logical place for Alexa would be in the car—and now hands-free DJing while driving a reality. Setup seemed straightforward, but it took a few tries because it wouldn’t allow me to hit Continue on one of the screens. When it works, it’s great and hears me well even through I mounted the device below the radio controls, rather than on the vent. Other times, the Alexa light turns on (indicating that it heard me say “Alexa”) but then it ignores what I’ve asked for.And…there are the times it says Alexa has lost contact with the app and “when it’s safe” I should pull over and re-launch the app. Overall, it works about 85% of the time, which is a bit frustrating. But the plusses outweigh the negatives: Beyond just music, it’s great to add items to my lists while driving—and it’s downright miraculous to pull into the driveway and say “Alexa, turn on the living room lights” and my house comes to life. Assuming Amazon works out the bugs quickly, it’s worth every penny. It’s a blast to just call out a song while driving and hear it play.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I recently took a road trip on Route 66 with my brother-in-law in New Mexico and Arizona.  We had a lot of fun asking for jokes, how far to the next town, directions to wherever, and calling up odd songs from our past from Amazon Music Unlimited.  We also discovered that comedy routines are also available.  A great way to pass the miles.Like any internet connected device, it only works while your mobile has internet access which we didn't on some stretches, but I expected that out in the middle of nowhere.  One unexpected bonus feature happened while I had the Echo Auto connected to the car's stereo via a patch cable and not through a Bluetooth connect between my mobile and the stereo.  A phone call to my mobile routed via the Bluetooth connection to the Echo Auto and then through the patch cable to the car stereo.  That was an nice unexpected surprise.",4,1,2019-10-25,1,1,0

I have an Alexa and an Echo Dot, as well as several Kindles. The Echo Auto seemed to be a good choice for listening to my music while driving. Wrong!! This thing has been a source of never-ending frustration. Even when I'm in the middle of downtown and practically sitting on a cellphone tower, it will stop playing and tell me that my mobile device has lost connection. Nine times out of ten it won't reconnect. It never seems to understand a command and I have to repeat myself over and over and over again. Sometimes when attempting to skip a song I will keep getting the annoying lost connection message, even though I haven't lost connection and the song I don't want to hear keeps playing. Every time, and I do mean EVERY time, that I've tried using it I end angry. annoyed, and yelling at the stupid device. Thinking I'll just throw this in the trash and never waste anymore time on it. It is the only thing from Amazon that I've ever totally hated.",1,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Google it, lots of issues still. Have to stay in Bluetooth mode all the time, drains your phone battery, sends audio clips when you text someone (it's a link to an audio file of what you say, no actual text). Hardwire kit sold separately; my cig lighter and USB plugs are in arm rest and I can't have the cable dripping across due to driving a MT.Looks cool, good idea and some of the skills are neat sounding. However that doesn't make up for Amazon's poor execution and lack of focus for what the customer actually needs in this product. Feels like a cheap money grab on Amazon's part, attempting to follow the Apple business model of increasing consumer switching costs through mass product integration into our lives.",1,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"When first announced , this was an invitation to buy product to start and early adopters got $25 off the retail price. I got my invite late and by the time they shipped mines it also included the air vent mount in the box (earlier units did not include it). It requires the app on iOS or Android to setup and it was fairly easy to do. It took me no more than 10 mins to get everything up and running. Your internet connection is shared from your phone via Bluetooth and it’s at times shaky. There’s so many variables involved: your phone, cellular connection and Bluetooth. It’s hard to pinpoint what causes certain disconnects and it would be ideal if the Echo Auto had its own independent connection but we also don’t want another payment to a wireless carrier so I’ll make due with Bluetooth from the phone for the time being. It supports both Bluetooth or Aux in to your car’s existing stereo system, which is nice for people like me who have an older car with no Bluetooth. When setup properly, it connects and reconnects to your phone via the Alexa app when your car is on. In my experience it works the majority of the time. I was also pleasantly surprised it’s mics we’re able to hear my commands in the nosiest of conditions. For $25 or even at full price ($50) I think it’s worth trying if you are heavily invested in the Alexa echo-system.",4,1,2019-10-6,1,0,1
"Purchased this through the invitation process. The Echo has issues staying on the vent mount at the magnetic spot, magnet needs to be stronger. At first there was several issues where it would not connect to the phone or recognize the bluetooth enabled phone was attached. Seems to have gotten better. I don't like things mounted to my air vents in the front dashboard, so because we use the back seat hardly ever, I mounted it to the air vents in the backseat area in the console. Still works fine with the recognition of my voice but does come off the mount vent more frequently that I would like.  Overall not a bad product, I like that if I am driving and I think of something that I need added to the grocery list, or reminder to pick up something along the drive home, I can set it with my voice and not have to stop the car to add a note to my phone. Def would help folks who continue to drive while using their phone.....",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"It's a nice addition to the car, but I can't make it work just right. I admit, it might be because I usually use my Bluetooth earpiece during driving that couses confusion in the settings.It plays only on the speakers or on my earpiece. I was only a few times able to play the music for my kids on the speakers through Alexa, while listening to my Kindle audiobook on my earpiece. This is my preferred setting, when the kiddos can listen to their favorite song (for the 100th time) and I'm enjoying my audiobook and everyone is happy.",4,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"I really love having this device in my car to arm/disarm my security system, change the AC at home, turn on lights, have directions sent to my phone, updates on my commute, listening to music, and being able to ask random questions.One disadvantage, which might have more to do with my car than the smart device, but there is about a 5 second delay from the smart device through my Bluetooth in my car. This makes some things tricky, if the device requires a response it will often pick up the delayed audio from the smart device before I have a chance to respond. I wish there was a way the device could register the delay, and not listen for an answer until the audio has stopped.",4,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"I have Echo devices all over my home, the echo devices are fantastic and I use them daily.  The Echo Auto isn't wonderful or even acceptable in my opinion.  I have Echo Auto in 2 vehicles and don't even bother plugging them in anymore, they're completely useless.  I've had connectivity issues since the day I received them and wish I would have sent them both back.  I've been in touch with customer service at least twice about the issues, they'll get them connected and the next time I use the vehicle they won't connect at all, won't even pair with the app now at all.  I've even tried two different cell phones with no luck.  The day or two they worked they were awesome but now they're not worth the work involved getting them to work.  I recommend getting the Echo devices for your home but I'd say stay far away from Echo Auto unless you have lots of spare time getting issues resolved only to have to get them resolved again and again.",1,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"We have two of these; one in an older car without BT or an Aux input and one in a newer car with BT and Aux.  On the older car, it's somewhat useful.  Being a 14 yo car it needs a cassette tape adapter to plug in to the Aux output on the Echo but once connected, it's can play music and can give you hands free voice control for pulling up navigation and making phone calls.  However, sound quality is relatively good for music, but terrible for everything else.  For whatever reason, no combination of volume on the head unit or the phone improves the sound quality on calls or nav; the best adjustment I’ve been able to find just makes it tolerable.  Generally speaking, it's a relatively inexpensive way to add this capability to an older car but the constant volume adjustments going from music to calls sort of defeat the purpose of “hands free”.  I had previously used a compact, rechargeable BT adapter in a similar fashion in this car that only costs $14; with an Android phone running the Alexa app, it makes the Echo Auto largely redundant.  The overall sound quality was better in all modes as well.  But, I do use multiple voice assistants, so the Echo Auto is still preferable to setting Alexa VA as the primary on my phone.  The only real advantage here is the voice response is much better with the Echo Auto since, without one, you can find yourself occasionally screaming at your phone repeatedly to do the same things.  So it’s not a universal solution for an older car and I’ve just learned not to do certain things with the Echo Auto; I’ve basically relegated it to being a BT adapter to the phone to play music.  In the newer car, it’s basically useless.  We unplugged it after about a week and haven’t missed it.  You can skip the Echo Auto and pretty much use your phone with the Alexa app.  Also, I use the vent mount on one and the dash mount on the other.  One set of vent slots is too big for the vent, and the other is too small.  I wound up breaking the vane I was trying to attach it to using the smaller slots because the bigger set was too loose.  The vent mount also has a cable guide that popped off after a few days; it appears that it’s just sticky taped on.  I’d skip that accessory if you’re thinking of buying it as an add on; it’s low quality as well as useless and not any better than just using the included dash mount.",2,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"If it were possible to leave a negative review, I would. I am so disappointed with this item that it borderlines on offensive. How Amazon can offer something for sale that is so ineffective is beyond me. It simply didn't do what it said it was going to do. Setup was odd, and when using the item, the Alexa app on my Iphone seems to want to do all the work. It did play music from Amazon but I couldn't get it to find my playlists. There were some helpful items available but the Bluetooth didn't work well with my car system. The beginning of all audio was clipped. In short, this is more trouble than it's worth. More cables to plug in and just a nuisance. I wanted to make it work, it didn't. Fortunately, Amazon is very good with returns so I am happy about that. As a result of this experience I have decided to cancel my Amazon unlimited music subscription and install  Sirius/XM in my car. I don't want my entertainment audio part of my phone.",1,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"I've been using this Alexa Auto for about a month now, so still learning. It took a couple of times to sync to the bluetooth in my car, once I got it working and turned it off, the next time I had to go through the same steps. But that resolved itself. I have used it with Pandora but it struggles with changing my Pandora stations. Now I am using just the Amazon Prime music and it's doing really well, although the library isn't as extensive. For example, when I ask for 80's New Wave Rock, it repeats the playlist after about 25 songs. But it's really easy to switch music, ask for Ozzy Osbourne or INXS, it is zippy with response. Now for Waze, it's a little touchy. You have to have the Waze app open on your phone and of course make sure that's your primary navigation choice, when I ask Alexa for directions to work, it will use the Waze app. But I don't know yet if it alerts you when there is a hazard on the road or police for example. What would be awesome is to have Alexa report on the Waze app when you encounter a road hazard or spot a police trap. Overall, I like this better than using my phone to do all of the above. I hope to try out more of Alexa's features as I get used to it.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,1
"I drive an older car with no Bluetooth, just an AUX port, so the Echo Auto's main function is actually just as a Bluetooth receiver - a job it does perfectly. Beyond that, the Alexa integration is a really nice way to simplify the process of starting music, making calls, etc... The 8 microphones work well to pick up my voice, provided there isn't air coming out of the specific vent the Auto is attached to. However, there are significant bugs, at least when paired with iOS, that keep this from being an amazing product:- you cannot send text messages or iMessages with iOS",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"I have 2 of these, each installed in cars with Apple Car Play. I’ve had no issues as yet. Basically I use it to request a station on Radio.com, play music, drop-ins on home, make announcements, etc. I have used it for directions but this is an area in need of improvement. On my iPhone I have to tap the notification on my phone for the directions to pop up on the screen. I have also been able to connect a second phone to it so if my wife takes the car she has access to it as well. This took some time figuring out as there were no set directions in the packaging and on the Amazon website. Found out it was as simple as settling up a new device on her phone as well even though she is signed in on the Alexa app with my credentials. All in all, great product. It adds to the hands free experience but I will stick with Siri when it comes to directions for the moment.",4,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"I received my Echo Auto mid July. Installation went well, small hitch because I was not paying attention. Alexa is very intuitive. I get help with finding directions, adding items to my shopping list, reading emails, making phone calls, I ""drop-in"" on my home Echos, as well as playing music and podcast. I have an info/nav system in my car which I have basically abandoned. Echo Auto plays nicely with Amazon Music and Pandora (I am guessing it works with other streaming services just as well). I have dropped SiriusXM, no longer needed. (Note: If you have not figured it out, your phone drives everything. Unlimited data is the only way to go to get the full benefit.) So, why not 5 stars? I have experienced a recurring problem connecting to the phone. It has been a bit of a crap shoot making the connection on a regular basis. I have learned to wait until everything fires up before leaving the driveway. It is not difficult to manually make the connection, just a bit time consuming. Only other issue is voice recognition is not always spot on, particularly if there is a lot of road noise or the audio is up. But is it worth the money? I would say yes.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"I use this in my 2007 Jeep Wrangler that doesn't have Bluetooth capability and run it through the AUX port on the radio. It looks decent, has a small footprint and blends in with the gray dash on my car. Sound quality is good, as good as anything else coming through the cars speakers. I use it primarily to stream music through Spotify and it works fairly well but has some flaws. In a Jeep with the top down at highway speeds, it cannot hear me, which means I have to handle the phone to select my music and Alexa Auto is just a 'dumb' transmitter. The windows and top are mostly off my Jeep from late April until October, so that makes this useless for half the year. Even in my other cars, I tend to drive with the windows down if the weather is decent. If you crank the A/C and keep the windows up all year, you won't have this problem.  The maps feature needs improvement. One time I kept asking for directions to Home Depot and it kept telling me how to get to my home. I ended up having to pick up my phone and enter what I was looking for manually. I'm not sure what else you would use this for besides music/audiobook streaming and getting directions. If your car has Bluetooth, Android Auto, Apple Carplay, a built-in navigation system, etc., I can't see what the use of this would be except for being able to launch apps by voice. But if it doesn't work with the windows down, what's the point? My other car has Bluetooth built-in and steering-wheel controls then let me skip tracks, adjust volume, etc, so I don't use it at all in that vehicle.",3,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I never write negative reviews, but this is the worst amazon product ever. I love Alexa. I was so excited for this. My kids were too. It is horrible. “When” it decides to work, it is nice. But you never know when that will be - it causes more frustration that anything else. Never even tried using it for directions because my phone gives me directions just fine and doesn’t lose connection constantly. And the cords all over are super annoying - I feel like they could do better there. Additionally it does something wonky with my phone where my calls will be connected to the echo in my car while I am inside my house and I can’t hear anyone until I disconnect the Bluetooth manually every single time (it automatically connects though again)... this also happens with Marco Poloor watching a video on my phone etc - anything with audio. It is just a really annoying product that is super finicky and testy. Love the idea in theory, but the theory didn’t transfer to product. Back to the drawing board on this one amazon - total fail. I kept giving it chances and watching YouTube videos to hopefully figure out how to make it work better so now return window is closed.

"In theory I thought this would be so cool, an item just like the 4 Amazon Echos that we have in our house. An item that I could ask any questions that I wanted while driving and get answers....however, the set up and connecting to it was spotty, it worked for a little bit and then didn't work, then I realized the ""buzz kill"" of this whole thing for me....the fact that you have to be hooked up to blu-tooth for this to work. I have Sirius Satellite radio in my car which I listen to almost 99% of the time, so the fact that I would have to switch it over to ask whatever questions I had was just not going to happen and i knew I probably wouldn't use it very often...I might have kept it in my Jeep if it wasn't for the fact that it would look very sloppy with wires going everywhere....after a small amount of thought (maybe 10 minutes tops) I figured out that my phone can pretty much do the same thing....so I got rid of this item.",2,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"Absolutely useless if you don't leave your radio set to bluetooth or Aux.

This device is taking forever to set up. One minute the app finds the echo auto and the next I'm sitting around for long periods of time waiting for the app to find the device again.

I'm not a fan of the wires all over my car either. I was hoping to secure it to a visor to keep it out of the way. The power cord makes that impossible. I had to keep it in my console where the outlets are. This thing only works with my car system through the AUX plug. Why is that?I'm sending it back. Can you let me know when you get a wireless version that doesn't require a cell phone with an active SIM card in it to make it work? I'm not buying a new phone just to have this thing.

"First, this is like any of the other echo product in that it connects pretty seamlessly and operates like all my other Echo products. I can easily move it between cars and it gets itself going without any issue. One car is Bluetooth the other is wired, more about that later. So the good is that it works.The problem is that I feel as though this was a hurried release and wasn’t completely thought through. The vent mount works but it is sort of half baked. As soon as you attach something to a vent it looses its adjustments and is now being blocked. I was able to mount it in one car without the vent using one of those anti slip pads and because it is blue tooth that installation is a hell of a lot cleaner than the wired.  A Velcro system would be better. car number two has to use the vent mount and the aux cord has to go from the dash to the center console it is really sloppy and the aux cord is far to short.

It is a solid device and definitely happy with the functionality of Echo Auto.My only complaint is that sometimes you have to repeat yourself two and three times for the initial connection in the car.  I have played around with this in a few ways, by trying it once car is on, waiting a couple minutes and the waiting several minutes, before getting Alexa to do anything.  It doesn't change anything.

I like the idea but it doesnt work well.Put the Alexa app onto your phone, bluetooth your phone to your car stereo system so that the stereo system provides microphone input and speaker output and you will have pretty much exactly the same thing as echo auto provides.  Well, echo auto probably surely picks up what you say much better than your car stereo/phone microphone would but that's pretty much the primary difference.  And I suppose that's a significant difference-especially in a noisy environment or if music is playing simultaneously.  So yeah, echo auto is fun and picks up your voice commands well.

I use her to find different types of businesses or restaurants near me and then have her give me directions. The Echo Auto can do everything an Echo Spot in your home can do. I also use it to make hands free calls and text messages both sending and receiving all hands free, and that is priceless in heavy traffic. I highly recommend you put this in your car it hooks up easy and is not in the way once you get it set up. There is also no noticable lag time when using the Echo Auto.

But, sometimes, even when playing music that you told it to play and it has been playing for a very long time...if you decide to listen to something else, Alexa will not recognize anything or answer back. Many newer vehicles have voice recognition already in them where you have to press a button and say a command. The plus side to Echo Auto is that you are completely hands free until the frustration of Alexa not answering throws you into a fit of road rage with your own sound system. I will say , on a positive note, that you have an old beater car....this is like having a gold bar on your dashboard.

"When I got my Echo Auto (EA) I was really excited and tbh, I still am. The sound quality is better than a Bluetooth (BT) dongle (add-on via the aux port) and integration is just as easy as plugging it in and mounting it where you want. Now, one or two issues I have. First, I have a Google Pixel 3XL and the EA pair up seamlessly and fast, but when I make a voice call (ie. ""Alexa, call my wife"") after the call disconnects the EA just sits there. You have to tell it to do what every you had her doing before, in my case listening to Sirius/XM and there have been more times than not where she is confused and starts complaining that BT is being used by another device (false). There was one time where after about 3 minutes the EA got itself sorted and started working again. Also, it seems to happen more on an inbound call than an outbound call. Second, the skill catalog is very limited and it doesn't have all the brains that say an Echo Dot or an Echo. Third, I have run into problems where if the Alexa app is running on my phone and I'm in the car with my EA, Alexa gets confused on where to play the music and more times than not Alexa plays it on my phone and won't transfer the audio to the EA. This is REALLY annoying because I have to either reboot my phone or turn off/on the BT and let the EA get itself sorted. All of these little things aside, I really like it and I want to love it.

If someone called on the telephone and no-one was home, they got no answer.  Voicemail had not yet been invented.

If reminders work I can't understand why timers or alarms don't work.  Oh well.

"Clearly not ready for prime time release. I bought 2, one for me and one for my wife. First both required an incredible amount of time/trys to get them to pair. They worked sort of.

Mine at first would send texts, but then quit, saying it wasn’t supported. My wife’s texts worked sporadically. Mine then refused to stop playing music, even when I left the car and hitting pause lasted about 2 seconds. On the other hand my wife’s would randomly start playing music-both in and out of the car.

So, if you activate Alexa via voice, this thing hears you, then sends the data to your phone which relays to the Amazon servers and then back to the phone, then to your car bluetooth from the phone.  This thing is just an ugly dash microphone that has flashing blue lights on it.The ONLY cool thing it does is the light on the Echo Auto scans back and forth like Knight Rider.  But this only happens when connecting or during setup.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I waited a long time to finally be able to get that unit through invite. Initial install was easy and all seemed to work fine... except it wouldn’t connect to Spotify. Restarted the app, reset the unit, and this time connecting to Spotify worked. Went on to do do a few errands- got back in my car and now it wouldn’t connect to Alexa app. Reset, go to setup again... nothing, still can’t connect to app. I give up, figure I’ll start over again when I get home. Now that I have more time, I do full reset - re-install again - the unit doesn’t wake up anymore. I’m sure that if contacting support and so on, it might ultimately have worked, but reading so many comments about the connectivity issues, i simply figured it really wasn’t worth the trouble  as it really doesn’t do much more than I can already do with Siri on my iPhone.If Amazon makes connectivity reliable, adds more functionality in future releases, I may reconsider.",1,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"I travel a lot for work. 25,000+ miles per year. I need to be productive during the time I am driving. Even though my 2018 Nissan has hands free calling, the Echo Auto has improved that functionality a ton and made using it safer. I can do everything verbally without fussing through all the commands or opening my phone. I also love that sending a text message also sends a voice file of my recorded message as well as the written text...just in case voice recognition changes some of my intended verbiage. Can also send my honey a little I LOVE YOU message from the road and she can hear me actually saying it. Call me old fashioned but I think that's cool.  I also like the easy access to voice memo skills on Alexa. For those worried about cords, I spent a couple minutes in the car hiding the power cord and it looks pretty clean. I could also take some double sided tape. Lower the unit and all but eliminate the cord from site but it really doesn't bother me. The added advantages of not having to open my phone while driving to do most functions is worth a single cord. I am lucky to be able to use the bluetooth connection which helps eliminate one of the potential cords. I could see some of the visual concern for those who cannot connect via bluetooth. I also have Amazon Mysic Ultimate which eliminates having to fumble for any CDs while driving down the road as well. It integrates perfectly with my Navigation system and doesn't audibly interfere with any directions. Both work well simultaneously. For me, this was a great purchase. It adds the features I wish my car had when I bought it. Great item!",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,1
"My car doesn't have Bluetooth, so I have always used a third party Bluetooth adapter. They generally work as well as you would expect when you hear the words ""Third Party"" on Amazon. So when my last one started getting static-y, I thought I would try the new Alexa that had just launched.Right away, the sound quality is INFINITELY better than any third party Bluetooth adapter, so I would have been satisfied with just that aspect for the price. But being able to listen to Audible and stream my playlists without having to look at the phone is a tremendous bonus.  In addition, I can use it to make phone calls, ask for directions (you can even set it to utilize Waze for directions instead of your native maps app), and drop in on your other Alexas to check on your family.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

"I'd always thought this was just a gimmick and that I could pretty much use Siri or Google on my phone while in my car. My wife's car is just 1 year shy of the Bluetooth update that was released for her make/model and was not able to connect her phone to it to play music. That's the only reason I got this, until we started using it of course.The setup is pretty easy if you've set up other smart devices around your home or phone. The sound quality or sound in general has to be a right mix between your phone's volume and your car's stereo volume. Too much on your phone and your bass and sound levels will sound like crap in the car. Overall the ability to instantly connect to our phones via Bluetooth without having to manually connect it is a huge plus over competitor Bluetooth receivers.",4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"OK so I got this before it hit the market as one of those 'selected few' to test it out at a lower price.  I am a SMART technology fan, so I was excited to try them out.  NOW< I can honestly review this because my car was broken into and it was stolen and I was considering buying another one - then I thought about it.  WHAT did the ECHO AUTO do that my phone couldn't?? ANYTHING? lNo - because you had to have your ALEXA APP open for this to work - so in essence it was extra wires and tech stuff in your car hanging out and in the way.  Considering most cars now are BLUETOOTH enabled there was nothing the ECHO AUTO DID that I couldn't do with my phone, handsfree even.  SO I opted not to buy.  Did I hate it? Not at all - I loved the conversations it sparked in my car. But wasn't worth the value to buy another one.  (But now I have the ECHO FRAMES which are similar BUT the reason I like these is Alexa can answer you and no one can hear it but you!)",3,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"I do like Alexa in my home, I have the original and a Show so I'm fully onboard with big Brother living in my house.  In the car however I haven't found a compelling reason yet.  I bought the Auto version because it was half price and I'm an early adopter.First, all the damn cables.  I have a 2006 Acura TL, great car, old car.  My Bluetooth works well with my iPhone 11 but with Alexa I need to use a tape player adapter to get it to work with my older car's sound system.  that means a power cable and cassette cable hanging down my dashboard.  Add to that my dash-cam and radar detector and that's just too many damn cables.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"Not sure why people have so many problems. Got two for two different types of cars. Both connected pretty seamlessly (using an android, so maybe apple is the problem, as usual). Love getting the news every morning on my way to work (top stories, quick and easy, not some long talk radio that goes 5 minutes on every story). Games are fun. Makes long drives more fun. The power cord is a bit annoying but the air vent mount helps with that. I got the beta version first and it doesnt have the mount, would be nice to be able to buy it separately. Nav kinda sucks because it just opens my phone's Google nav which I can do anyway. Would be nice if Alexa just told me where to go. She has thousands of apps so there are tons of things she can do. I wouldn't start complaining unless you've tried them all. Love that I can add stuff to my shopping list on a whim when it pops in my head, or drop in on the house quick and easy without having to call. Let's of good features.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"I was super excited to get this after signing up for the invite to try it out before released.  Setup and connection were very easy. But then the issues started.  It takes a few minutes for Alexa to actually get connected and working.  You cannot use it as soon as starting up the car, it takes a good 5 minutes or so before which can be annoying.  Second the stand for the unit has an adhesive rubber piece that holds the cord in place, every time I come out to my car it has fallen off, the adhesive does not stick.  You have an option to use an aux cord or USB for connection to the car, but you must select Bluetooth for it to work through the speakers. This means I cannot use my ipod while in my car for audio which really sucks!!  Alexa has a mind of her own when she wants to work, sometimes it takes at least 10 ""Alexas"" to make it work.  My favorite feature however on the good side is being able to tell Alexa ""resume audible"" and she picks right up and plays where I left off which I really like. I also like my kids being able to play games on it while in the car or ask a quick question, but realistically, the Alexa app on the phone can do all this too so not quite sure what the advantage here is.  Really wish it was less complicated and I may have rated this higher but the difficulties and cons exceed the benefits at this point.",3,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"So far so good in my 2014 F150. I'm using it through the Audio port vs bluetooth since Fords Sync is terrible auto connection after in and out of the vehicle with my phone.The device picks up my voice great and it's nice to be able to pick a song, listen to weather or hear any info needed without having to pull out my phone.",4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I have Alexa on all 4 of my Echo Dot devices all over my house and I have Alexa on my iPhone with the Amazon app. I was excited to get Echo Auto but found that my IPhone can only connect through my Aux. line in my car unless I want to keep the cables so tight that I cannot steer my car or risk hanging my passenger. So, I am forced to use the Aux line which is standard 1.5 cabling and it picks up the high hiss of the engine electronics in my car. The sound is terrible! Sounds like an AM radio with more static and the sound is very thin. I have decided to ultimately just plug my IPhone in directly to my car (I do not have Apple Play, my car is older than that technology) which makes the Echo Auto completely worthless to me. I will be selling it on Facebook Marketplace. I would think if you can plug directly into the unit and not use Aux you would have better sound with this device, for me, it is garbage.",1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto was easy to set up.  I commute a ways, and I love being able to listen to my news briefing along the route, not to mention other Alexa app skills, like what’s the question of the day.  The only gotcha is that it sometimes doesn’t hear me over the road noise or when my windshield defroster is on high. On a few occasions it responds, you say the command, and it doesn’t answer. Just stays silent. Mind you, this is more the exception, but surprising. I do like the ability to do drop ins without having to touch the phone. I had waited for the release for months. It’s been a good addition to my Alexa family.  One more thing...  While they did include a vent mount.  It works with a magnet that fits a square inset on the back of the device.  I wish that they had the option of a mounting that could attach flush on the dashboard and the device magnetically connect.  You could easily detach the Echo and hide to remove the temptation of a break in if someone were so inclined.  I added Command Hook tape to the back, which works fine, but can’t detach to hide the Echo.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"Ehhh. I mean, not really what I expected. I can’t use it for many things I would like. You can have Alexa send a text message unless the other user also has the Alexa app. Just seems silly. You also can’t have Alexa access podcasts though Apple. It’s just sort of annoying. The wires are pretty annoying, too. I know some of this is maybe to be expected for the kind of product it is but I’m really just pretty eh about it. I will say, the main reason I wanted it was because my car Bluetooth is god awful so I absolutely hate using it. This does allow me to play stuff from my iPhone- I use the aux cable to my car from the Alexa. I then connected the Bluetooth and it allows me to get onto my phone and press play on Apple podcasts or to play music from other apps. I still have to manually start and stop stuff, though. I dunno, it was free through my insurance company and allows me to play music in my car.  Just ok. Not worth much to most.",3,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I've had this for over six months, and I have to say that it works really well. It is nice to be able to just ask Alexa to play my playlist or read an audio book I have. However, there are somethings that annoy me. If I ask Alexa to play my playlist ""Road Trip"" for instance, it streams it, even if I have the music downloaded to my phone. Same thing with Audio books. This is kind of annoying, especially if I'm traveling through an area that doesn't have good cell service. I can just play from my phone, but that is not quite as continent. My car is a 2010 model, and only has an audio in jack, but it works really well. I do have some problems if my phone is on WiFi while I pull out of the driveway, I'll spend a few minutes before it will start to work. Additionally, sometimes it just doesn't work on the road and I'll need to reset it, but after that it works fine. The only other weird thing I've noticed, which may be an Amazon thing, or a Samsung thing, sometimes when I'm wearing my Samsung watch, and I ask Alexa to read or play music, it will connect through my watch as if it is a phone call, which means awful quality, and I need to go to my watch to hang up the call, to get better quality audio. But over all, it is well worth the price, especially on sale.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"Oh man, I'm not sure where to start.  I really wanted to to enjoy the Echo Auto but to be honest, it falls sooooo short.  Every time I try to give it another shot, I end up just giving up because there is always something that starts acting buggy.  This product in my opinion is far from being released to the public.  Even me being an Engineer, struggle to make it usable.Things that drive me nuts : 1) Alexa voice keeps cutting off when she starts talking  2) Doesn't work with Spotify (randomly I will hear the song I requested minutes ago)  3) Going between AUX and Bluetooth mode is a total headache  4) At times Alexa is totally unresponsive, she just keeps thinking  5) I've probably had to uniinstall and reinstall Echo Auto like 10 times thinking this would fix it.",2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

Even though my car has Bluetooth capability, it was still very confusing to get it to work. I did finally manage it, but it took several days. Also, every time I get in the car, I have to sync it.  Which is annoying!Alexa does a great job of hearing me, but she has a slightly longer pause than my Echos at home.  Before I forget to mention it, it’s important to note that the Echo Auto runs through your cell phone.

"Let me first start off by saying I have multiple Echo Devices and I absolutely love them.  When I heard that Amazon was developing Echo Auto I was thrilled and requested an invitation as soon as I was able to.  Well after receiving and using the Echo Auto for the last few weeks I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed.  I was expecting a completely hands free experience, however that is not the case.  In fact I'm more distracted than if I just used my phone with Bluetooth.  Almost every time I get into my vehicle Alexa tells me that she's having trouble connecting to the network, or that Alexa can't connect to the Alexa App.  And I have to pull out my phone and connect Alexa to the App.  And on the rare occasion she doesn't ask me to open the app, she takes a full minute or longer to connect.  About half the time I tell her to play some sort of music she just beeps at me and doesn't do anything.  Forget making a call or sending a text message hands free (at least with iOS) because you have to confirm everything by pressing a button on the phone.  Amazon missed the mark on Alexa Auto!",1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I'm still trying to make it work--I haven't given up yet. I almost had it and actually got a response, but that's as far as it went. I'm trying to get it to work via my iPhone and Alexa app through Bluetooth in my 2016 Rogue. Actually this device seems extraneous since we might be able to do what this is intended to do with only the app. In other words, most of what Echo Auto is supposed to do, my iPhone could also do with the right app. Of course, Alexa might then usurp Siri, which she would not like.UPDATE: From three stars to one. I gave up! I really wanted this thing to work but returned it after numerous attempts (both following the directions and being creative). In the end, it wouldn't work. My brother had the same experience. I could get a single Alexa response after setup, and then it would make a few dying sounds and become unresponsive. The problem might be me, my phone, or car, but if so I'm certainly not alone. Mind you, I have several other Echo devices and use Fire TV regularly and love them all.",1,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"I have a house full of echo devices and now multiple automation devices. I was reluctant to buy the Echo Auto as the benefit was not fully clear to me. I have to say though that this is a well designed device, with superb voice recognition under the adverse conditions of car noise. The connection with my Iphone is instantaneous and reliable, without need for any intervention. I simply enter the car and Echo is available to me. The sound quality is excellent through the car speakers either via Bluetooth or via the Aux port (I tried both). Overall, what many do not understand and question the need for, the Microphone array is absolutely essential for this kind of applications. In the past I had a very long trip in which I installed an old echo on the top of the Dash. It was an attempt to have the same functionality, worked relatively well but as well as Echo Auto that is designed for this precise purpose.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"I am a huge Amazon/Alexa/Echo fan. I have 14 various devices between work and home. I have fully bought into the devices and connected services. For this Echo Auto I was on a waiting list for somewhere near 9 months. I thought it was either never going to come out or they had major issues with it. I think it was the latter.First issue. It’s not 1997 and people don’t want 10 dangling cables in the car to use basic services. The way Amazon recommends mounting and connecting this is the first deal breaker for me. You need a power cable and possibly auxiliary cable to reach the included vent mount. They mention several places about dash mounting, but with no apparent included choice or available accessory to dash mount. I’m lucky in that I have an Acadia that has a compartment built into the dash with a USB port. Then what I did is bought a $3 magnet from Home Depot and mounted it to my dash. Since all the vent mount is is a magnet, I did the same job in a homemade dash mount and only about an inch of cable shows where it’s ran into the storage compartment. It looks very nice and streamlined compared to most people’s unfortunate “recommended” setup.",1,1,2019-10-15,1,0,1
"My car has bluetooth but isn't smart, so I thought I'd give this a try. Getting power to it is the biggest challenge, because who wants ugly cables draped everywhere? I ended up running a very long micro USB cable behind my dashboard, under the A-pillar cover, behind the headliner, to right above my rear view mirror. The other end of the USB cable is plugged into a socket I ran off of a switched 12V line under the dash. I mounted the Echo Auto to the windshield with heavy duty velcro (the included magnetic mount couldn't hold the device at that angle). The result is a clean installation with no visible wires. The location of the Echo hasn't had any effect on the voice recognition or sensitivity. You can barely even see it when you're sitting in the front seat unless the blue ""I'm listening"" light is on.I use the Echo Auto mostly for music, and it does a fantastic job of streaming from Prime Music. I've been a little less successful with asking Alexa to pull up directions or opening apps on my phone. It's finicky. In that department, Google wins, hands down. For the pre-order price, though, I'm pretty happy with what the Echo Auto does for me. It's one of my most frequently used Echo devices (out of about a dozen).",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

I would not pay full price for it - I was one of the people who got invited to try it so I only paid about half price for mine and 25 bucks was definitely worth it. I mainly use mine for music. Instead of risking my life and the lives of those around me as I search for a specific song on my phone, I simply say ""Alexa, play ____ by ____"" and it beeps and plays the song. It's incredible for someone who listens to a ton of music (and doesn't have a passenger to DJ).

Asking her for directions anywhere is also a pain, as she cannot recognize any names of locations, unless it's extremely simple. This is nowhere near worth $50. I wouldn't even recommend it at $25.

It might work better if the Echo Auto was a low power WiFi hotspot so communications between the phone and the Echo could be done using WiFi leaving Bluetooth just for car/Echo communication.The software works well but some things could do with improvement.

"If you are an echo fan (we have one in some form in almost all rooms) and are used to using Alexa in your daily life, this is a great addition to the car.I seriously didn't think it would be beneficial to have this, particularly since I have the Alexa App installed on my phone already, and although you can certainly be without one, it is convenient to use it on the go. I enjoy being able to utilize my music as I do at home, asking for directions and also having the ability to get new radio recordings and podcasts with ease on the road. We also like using it to play games when in traffic.",4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"1. Does not respond to commands such as ""alexa, cancel"" or ""alexa, silence"". Plays (tunein radio, for instance, unceasingly, despite all attempts to silence it).2. Takes a VERY LONG TIME to re-establish functionality after encountering even the most-minor drop in cellular data coverage. In an area with spotty reception, this is a 100% functionality-killer, especially since the device does not resume what it was doing following a momentary interruption in its data connection (similar to a problem that plagues all Echo devices).",1,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"What I love about other Alexa products are their convenience for playing music, asking questions about the weather, setting alarms, etc. I got echo auto thinking it would function similarly: I'd be able to navigate to gas stations, unfamiliar locations, play music, all hands-free and by extension do these things safely while driving.Instead echo auto is inconvenient and unreliable. In order to do anything you have to open the alexa app on your phone before driving - it won't open it itself so if you forget its usless. In order to play music on spotify you have to have already opened the app before you start driving (although this problem does not also occur with amazon music which I find suspicious). Same to navigate with google maps you have to open it before driving. Which means you have to know what apps you are going to use when you start driving. Additionally, in order to get navigation instructions you have to let the Alexa app ALWAYS use your location instead of just when using the app (which makes no sense of course). This is all further aggravated by the inaccuracies of the device which unlike other echo products is slow to respond, and frequently misunderstands me.",2,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"Well I think I found out that if you Bluetooth it directly into a system that's the best connection to have. I have two of these 1 in a 2019 traverse where can I exchange works great the other in a 2010 Tundra or I have to use a cable to connect the audio. I tend to have a lot of connection issues when I get into my truck for the auto echo to connect to the Alexa app. We don't have this issue jumping into the newer vehicle. well it doesn't take much to connect it something I'd rather not do every time I get in. Try to troubleshoot contact customer service look online at YouTube unfortunately can't seem to get the issue to go away. Now when it's working it's great, I love the interaction and the ability to use the services offered. It's amazing.

"I guess I was expecting this to transform the mediocre U-Connect sound/media system which came standard in my car into a supercharged GPS voice-command navigation and media system.I can say that it works, but at least for my car's feeble U-Connect system, it's underwhelming.

"After trying a different voice assistance device (a popular brand that will go un-named), I found that it was too faulty and the microphone was too small, therefore requiring me to be pretty loud when needing to access it. To start, the Echo Auto is right in size, and I found that I was able to access the device fairly easy. With it being mounted up top, I think it makes it easier for the voice recognition to work properly.I installed my Echo Auto in my 2001 Camaro, which also has a Bluetooth enabled aftermarket stereo. For those of you without Bluetooth, if you have an audio auxiliary port in your vehicle, a cable is included for a hardwired setup. My car is very loud, but I was still able to use the Echo.

Integrates not only with Alexa in your phone, but your entire Alexa web - I can turn the same lights at home on and off (including the front porch lights when I get home late in the dark, or as I'm leaving to save money) that I can from home. (Also plays great poltergeist-like tricks on your kids from afar!) :) It also gives me full voice control and access to my Amazon music library, which I didn't fully have (at least to this extent) before.Overall, it's a gadget.

"Nice and compact little device, and puts Alexa in your car which can be helpful if you want to remember something, add something to a list, or remotely turn some lights on or off at home.  BUT!  you have to have your car radio always on bluetooth in order to interact with it.  Sometimes I like to listen to the radio, and when I am, I have to switch back to BT in order to hear Alexa's responses.  I can do that with just the app on my phone and that right there negates any need for this extra little device.  On top of that, some newer car stereos are coming with Alexa built in, so this device is niche market at best and won't be long before it's obsolete.  I used mine for about a week, realized that it was more trouble than it was worth and sold it to a co-worker.

One for an older Miata convertible with no Bluetooth and the second one for a Honda Ridgeline with both Bluetooth and Apple Car Play. I connect with both gadgets using the Bluetooth on my iPhone. The one in the Miata works beautifully even with the convertible top down. It picks up all Alexa commands through the wind noise. Amazing.Even though I already have CarPlay in the Honda I find that I prefer using the Echo Auto for phone calls and music. Alexa seems to be a bit smarter than Siri, which gets confused at times.  The Echo can also control things like lighting in my home and make announcements.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"So I finally tested out the Echo Auto on a road trip from Virginia to upstate New York and back. I connected it to a new-model Jeep Compass rental. The hope was that it would provide a much-needed distraction during the long road trip with its games and music. What I discovered was that it was not ready for its prime time debut. The long-and-short of it: it's inconsistent. We attempted to play 3-player games... there were three of us in the car... it could not consistently decipher voices from the back seat. I would give it commands... sometimes it would work... sometimes it would not.Now before Amazon blames the phone's service (the Echo Auto depends on the Alexa app on your phone) please realize these are the same hurdles Hey Google, Siri, and Cortana face every day with far better results.",2,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"My only issue is that I turn my truck on, wait a minute or two and then when I say Alexa, it always says it lost the connection to my phone. Ok, no problem, reconnect. I’ve had a few instances where I’m sitting in the parking lot for 10 or 15 minutes pushing buttons and messing with the Bluetooth on my phone trying to get the thing to connect. In that time I could have made it home already. Not sure if other people have an issue getting it connected every day or not but for something that’s supposed to be convenient, it’s been a bit annoying so far. Especially when I have the USB cable hanging out of my stereo already. Never had a problem with that $4 cord.Also, the cords ALWAYS seem to hang out in my cup holder when I try to put my coffee down. Am I too lazy to do a little cord management?  Yes. But again, it’s supposed to be about convenience. Walking ALL the way up to the second floor to get a hair tie out of my daughters’ room isn’t convenient, especially since I’m already 15 minutes late to work everyday thanks to the snooze button.",3,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"This does the job although it's slower and clunkier to use than a home Echo.  You have to wait for the acknowledgement tone after the wake word, which takes noticeably longer to respond than in the home.  Voice recognition is about as good as the home units. I have occasionally had trouble with it crashing; not excessive, but more than a home unit.  It is nice for getting traffic, news, and weather reports when driving, as well as playing music and audiobooks.  It seems to have trouble getting a good connection when voice dialing, but if I use the built-in voice dialer in my car, there is no problem and the Echo will pause or mute while I'm on the phone. I have also used it to get directions and it integrates well with Google Maps. I recently injured my right shoulder and having voice control over things like maps, phone, and music/news has been extremely helpful.  I also set up a GPS-based routine which reminds me to take out the trash when I pull into the driveway on Tuesdays :-)",4,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"After almost a year of waiting for the invitation to be redeemed, my Echo Auto finally arrived. I couldn't wait to set it up in my Subaru Crosstrek so I went outside immediately and ... and ... Wait ... Almost ... Nope ... There it goes... Nope, lost it again. Tried for about 45 minutes and it would work, not work, not work, work again. I tried calling support. They were pleasant, but had no idea why the Bluetooth did not seem to stay connected. When I tried using the Aux cable, it was a collosal fail. Finally, an update to the app came out and iOS 13 was installed. Seems to have made the connection more consistent, but still not responsive. At times music is still playing on the speakers while Alexa is trying to give me more information. I truly enjoy the Alexa products, but this makes me VERY weary to spend money on the loop or the big bucks on the frames. At least I only paid the $25 invite only price.",1,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0

"Connectivity for me was easy. Better if done in the car. This does need to be able to connect to your phone which is great because it some what keeps me hands free but I did experience a glitch or 2 with Losing connection to my phone. It has this safety feature which is good but I always have to press that I’m a passenger to bypass it. The more I use it the more connectivity gets better  when plugging it up in the car. It generally connects automatically. The mics are amazing. Phones calls are clear on both ends. Better than my bluetooth. The mount is ok. It’s sturdy but I’m not a fan of it. Playing music on it is great. This device basically amplified my phone for a hands free drive. It’s like having a dot in the car. The only feature I wish they add would be texting capabilities. It would be nice to be able to voice text and have text read.

"If you have a bluetooth audio in your car this is a complete waste of money! The Alexa App on your phone will do ""all"" the same things Echo Auto will do... in fact the app on my phone recognizes and exacutes commands better that the Echo Auto. The ""only difference"" is on the app you have to push ""one"" button on your phone for it to start listening for a command. I guess if you have a older car (with no Bluetooth audio) or a broken finger it may be worth the $50...but for the most part it really adds nothing you don't already have via the app. Playlists can be pulled up through the app with just ""one"" button push and a voice command, after the playlist is playing it can be controlled with your steering wheel controls ie...volume, fast forward, rewind etc...

Amazon needs to do better testing on firmware updates.  I was unable to make calls for a few days.  I think there was an update that stopped it from working.I can get driving directions, find out how long it will take me to get home, turn on the lights at home from the car and many other things.

"I got this on the introductory half-off invitation. I use it primarily for playing music, and it is great for that, in my 10-year-old car with no Bluetooth. Alexa understands my voice requests reasonably well with the stereo and A/C on, but when I take calls on it, callers complain of background noise and sometimes echo. (Pun intended.) Perhaps the A/C vent isn’t the best place to mount a device with microphones.I’m looking for a dash mount so I can put it in front of the instrument cluster, behind the steering wheel, also making the buttons easier to reach in my car. That might also give me a better chance to hide the mess of cords that necessarily go with this type of retrofit. Incidentally, the adhesive on the cord keeper is no match for Florida heat, even in the fall; mine fell off within a week.",3,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0

All you need is a vehicle with an aux port or bluetooth (or a Bluetooth radio transmitter which can be easily added to car that dont have these capabilities) and the alexa app. I use mine primarily for hands free calling and spotify. I personally use the wake word echo on my home device so its a bit of a bummer that they dont have the functionality to change that in the app yet. Can’t wait to see where this product goes in the future. Would definitely recommend for the hands free calling alone, though it should be noted that the person to whom you are speaking may be able to hear an echo of themselves on their end.Pros:",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

"My feelings on the Echo Auto are mixed.  When it works, it's a dream to have in the car.  In the mood to hear a song?  Ask Alexa for it.  Want to hear random 80's rock music?  She'll play an 80's rock station for you.  It's looking stormy, should I worry?  Alexa will look up the local weather for me.  The the price, that kind of voice control is great.That's when it works.  I've had several times where Alexa will lose access to the Amazon Music and/or Alexa applications.  I'm using an iPhone 8 with iOS 13 version.  Alexa and Apple can't seem to get along consistently.  When the loss of access happens, I need to open the Amazon Music app manually and click the ""OK"" button on the error message to fix the issue.  A couple of days later, it will happen again.  There doesn't seem to be a specific trigger, it just happens randomly.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

Then when I tried again in the car it failed to connect a few times. After a few try I finally realized that my phone is on a very weak WiFi signal of my house as my car is on the driveway.

If we only had one or two available, I would probably be unplugging it all the time.I pointed the cord towards the steering wheel which doesn’t impact anything since we have a push button start.

Other times (after reset, disconnecting/forgetting BT) it showed up on the accessory list and then couldn't connect.  In BT settings it showed as connected.  Besides not working, the power cord is huge and sticks out of the side about 1-2"" because it's just a microusb cord stuck in the side of it.  All in all, a bad experience with a questionable product at best.

After getting the device connected and working with the Bluetooth function on my Toyota Prius, it worked great for two trips. But that’s when things took a turn for the worse. The Echo would no longer connect to my phone and just kept saying it couldn’t connect. I had to uninstall the device from my phone and account, restart my phone, and then repair the device. Things went well for about a week, but then the same thing happened again! Ugh! So I went through the entire uninstall and reinstall again. I found that if you try to use the echo auto device before it’s connected to your car’s Bluetooth function that this occurs. Ultimately, if you already have Bluetooth voice commands built into your car, avoid this device.

However, if there’s a specific song in my library I want to listen to, I have to pick up my phone and search for it. I drive on a lot of high speed two lane roads, so if I move the wheel an inch people are gonna die, especially me because my truck is pretty bare bones with safety. With that, this echo got my attention. All I really do with it so far is control music. Although I’d like to set it up for calling and texting, which is actually a pretty confusing process. My first negative, and I’m sure will be resolved soon, is that every now and again I’ll get in and say “Alexa,” and I get a loud ”DIIING, your echo auto has lost connection with your phone.” When I unplug it and plug it back in it usually just comes right back though. My guess is that this could be because my truck’s outlets always have power running through them, as opposed to a lot of other cars where they are only powered when the car turns on. The other thing is that mine came in an envelope, which is usually fine, but my other echo devices have always come in a small box to protect it. My device was fine, but the box for the mount had a pretty good size dent in it. Especially in the debut of a product, I feel like it should be better packaged.

Right now, it can play music and look things up, but it could not tell me any navigation directions. It says it's not able to do that.

It does things well that I have never asked of my home echo like making phone calls, sending/reading texts, etc.Pairing was pretty simple, and I've gotten a new phone, so I've paired it again to a new phone which was painless.  The only minor weirdness I had was when it was running through the into videos, it would give an example ""Say Alexa to ....."" and it would trigger itself, pause the video to wait for instructions, then resume.

"Got this when it first came out, have loved it every day since.  Install took about an hour, just to hide the wires on a 2008 highlander.  Hooked up to the phone right away.  Works great to play music and answer random questions.  Microphone could be a little better, it’s not bad just could clearer.  Only thing I would like changed is the ability to sync multiple phones.  One trick to get it setup faster is turn off your WiFi on your phone.  In my driveway I have intermittent WiFi so it won’t work.  Same with leaving the house I have to wait for my phone to be completely disconnected from my WiFi before it starts to work.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,1,1
"I’m loving Echo Auto. Have used it for the past few weeks on my hour long drive to work and back home. Alexia reads me the news every morning, reads my audiobooks from Audible, and easily plays music and jokes. Echo Auto allowed me to actually go hands free with my audiobooks and taking work calls while commuting. Absolutely recommend.The only issues I’m having is that Echo Auto takes about a minute to connect to my phone each day. I’ve had one incident where it failed to connect but a simple unplug and replug with power solved the issue. One other tweak that Amazon can make is that my phone stays connected, or auto connects to Echo Auto when I’m in my house. This poses problems as I’m taking work calls from inside the house while it auto connects to Echo Auto, thus losing audio until I switch input back to the phone.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"I was one of the beta testers for this and I've had it since pretty much since it's inception. I wanted to love this, I really really wanted to love this. I wanted this so bad and couldn't wait to get it. Sadly it has been nothing but a disappointment. It is so glitchy all the time. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't and that's just what you get used to.The most annoying aspect for me was that it literally works through your phone. The Bluetooth connects to your phone your phone connects to your car. I cannot for the life of me understand why they just don't have an app for your phone and cut out the middleman. Oh that's right they want to sell you a useless device.",2,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"In all honesty I just don't see the point. My car has a stereo with bluetooth. I thought the echo auto would be easier so I could change the song or make phone calls without having to wait for a red light or glance away from the road. I had high hopes and was really optimistic, but this just didn't do it for me.First, there are a lot of cords. With all of the smart plugs and such, I thought it would be bluetooth connected and not making my dashboard look crowded.",3,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"I love Alexa.  I wanted to love Alexa Auto.  The price is sure right.  Unfortunately this device isn't well thought out and won't work for most people.  It doesn't have it's own speaker.  Think about that for a moment.  For it to work it has to use your cars speakers for output.  Which means, at least in my car, that I have to tune the audio system to a Bluetooth connection or an AUX connection.  Which means I can't listen to regular radio or XM radio. I guess I could stream Amazon music, pandora, Tune-in - even XM radio via my cell phone data plan - but those options all chew through my data and cost me $$$.  So I have to choose - either Alexa or Radio.  I can't listen to XM Radio and have Alexa mute the audio when she talks like I can when I get an incoming phone call.  Honestly I just can't see this thing catching on.  What this device needs is a nice loud speaker.",1,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
I had this in my car it worked good for 3 months. I took it in when my car was being stored. I put it back in my car two months ago and it has stopped working.

"I have a 2018 Toyota Prius Prime Advanced Plug-In. The Echo Auto I bought was intended for the aforementioned car. The first problem I had was that the air vent mount had only four positions and a horribly designed rubber ball with slots in it. After much frustration I finally was able to get it installed into an air vent.When I set up the Echo Auto, I had trouble connecting to my iPhone and the car via Bluetooth, but it finally ""worked itself out"".",1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0

(8/2020.. not yet!)Glitchy would be a compliment.. I expected that, but figured they’d fix it. GPS integration has issues. How do I get to use Waze? Why does it go to some radio service, with ads, when I ask to play news from a specific source, like CNN, MSNBC? My Echos at home connect directly. When I connect to some music channels, it plays the same selections each time. Oh.. and volume control isn’t consistent. The surprise of full volume from my VERY powerful system, when switching between Alexa and car system, needs to be fixed. Connectivity? Not so good. I can drive for several minutes, still getting a “Not Connected” message. And finally, it’s kind of a shame to have to drape a cable over the dash.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,1
"This is the worst Amazon Echo line of products I have ever tried to utilize.  I say ""tried"" because I still can't get the Echo Auto to consistently reconnect to my vehicle, after shutting the vehicle down, and restarting it later.  The initial setup went just fine and I thought I had everything working as it should.  I was able to stream music from my Amazon account, via my Samsung S9+, and even ask Alexa questions, with no problem.However, the nightmare happens after you shut the vehicle down and restart it later, hoping the Echo Auto would reconnect automatically.  I followed the instructions and made sure my vehicle was set to Bluetooth input.  My phone was connected via Bluetooth to my vehicle correctly.  However, I noticed that my Echo Auto was producing a beeping / chiming sound when I started to drive.  If I asked Alexa anything, it would say that it was trying to connect and the beeping / chiming would persist.  Once it gets to this point, the only way I can get the Echo Auto to work again, is to unpair it, have my phone forget it and perform the entire setup again.  I've tried the ""workarounds"" offered from other comments and from Googling for tips, but with no success.  It did succeed to elevate my frustration levels.  I'd like to think I'm tech savvy, but this thing truly humbled me.  I'm glad there are some people that can get this to work seamlessly, but I feel for those who can't.  I have wasted much time trying to get this garbage to work again.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Echo line of products, except the Echo Auto.  I personally have two Echo Shows, two Echo Dots and an Echo Spot that work flawlessly at my home.  Amazon needs to perform a major overhaul with integrating the Echo Auto with a vehicle.  It seems that the Echo Auto gets confused, because my phone needs to be connected to my vehicle's Bluetooth and the my phone via Bluetooth, simultaneously.",1,1,2019-12-10,1,1,0
"I know a lot of people are thinking Siri can do all of the same things what's the point? But Siri still won't do anything with Spotify, which is just one example of a huge problem with Siri, Apple doesn't integrate support for any competing services. With Alexa I can finally do everything I want with Spotify hands free in my car. When my friend is riding shotgun and in charge of music he can just ask Alexa to play whatever comes to mind.I like that I can get in the car and have Alexa announce that I'm on my way home through the Alexa devices in my house, or turn on my smart thermostat if I am coming home at an irregular time. Siri annoyingly can't control anything useful. Is it a bit extra? Yea, but its cool.

"Setup for this was pretty frustrating. I don't know how I got it to work. I'm an Uber driver and I use a 4G Ipad for navigation instead of a phone. I wanted this to connect to the Ipad. Well I followed the setup at least 10 times to no avail. For some reason the test sound was playing on an Echo Dot in my house according to my kid. I eventually gave up on the Ipad and decided to try my Iphone. It wouldn't work either but after I tried the phone, like some kind of magic, it worked on my tablet without redoing the setup. I have no idea how that happened but it did.My main plan for this was as a bluetooth adapter that I would plug in the Auxiliary port on my minivan. The built in Bluetooth is terrible. This thing does well. You might want smaller cables becasue they ones included are long. The long cables are to allow you to route them behind stuff though so you don't have cables flying all over. My setup is reasonable. You just have to be creative. It need power and if you don't have bluetooth in you car it need the audio cable. Don't know why people are complaining about that?",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I wanted Alexa Auto so that Alexa would read my Kindle books for me in the car.  I can.  Alexa Auto doesn't recognize titles as well as the normal Alexa, not sure why, but I only have trouble with tricky names.  For example: there's a book named Treyah: An Origin Story.  Alexa Auto (AA) can not find that title for me and its guesses are pretty bad.I have a Chevy Volt so there's an excellent place for Alexa Auto to reside (nice and hidden).  I would never use the attachment that came with it.  But that's just me.",4,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"I have an older car that doesnt have bluetooth or an aux input. I do have a tape player so I connected the Echo Auto with a cassette adapter that has a 3.5mm connection. With the Alexa app on my phone I can now ask Alexa questions while I'm driving. I initially bought it as a ""fun to have"" toy since we would sometimes be driving around and joke that ""where's Alexa when you need her"". What I did not realize is that through Echo Auto I would now be able to use all the features of my phone hands free. I can now make/receive calls and stream music from my phone without having to add a new stereo. I also like that you can mute the Echo Auto very easily.What I dont like is that the volume control isnt great. I have to have Alexa set to volume 1 or 2 and the radio set to low volume for Alexa to sound normal. At default settings it blows my speakers up even if the radio volume is turned down.",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
I had an invitation to try the alexa Auto.My impressions are:,3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"What I did not like was signing up for the invite over a year ago. Being told I would get the $25 promo invite eventually, but never receiving. Suddenly they were available for black friday - after being told the reason for slow invites was production. At least they were on sale similar to the ""launch"" pricing. The blue tooth is a little wonky. It pauses at times. This could be my car, but Alexa seems to disengage and you have to start whatever you were using auto for all over. Volume comes in a lot lower for me, so I need to be careful when I switch back to the radio because it is deafening. Overall, auto connects easily with my Alexa account and is discreet (smaller than I expected, which I consider a plus). It's great to have access to my audible, music, and news on the go. I'd give 5 stars for the product, but really would love to give Amazon 0 stars for the way this rolled out last year and the time waiting for my ""special"" invitation.",4,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"Not impressed.  This thing found a new home in my garbage can.  It frequently acknowledges a call out of ""Alexa"" by lighting up and then just closing out.  When it does acknowledge I am usually trying to play music (all it really does at a level worth reporting on).  It will play music relatively well through the car speakers, except that it refuses to stop.  If you close the music app it reopens it.  The only way I have found to get it to quit is to ""force close"" the Alexa app and then close Amazon Music.  This thing is not ready for prime time (pun intended).  Save your money or make better use of it by burning it to stay warm rather than wasting it here.",2,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"I've loved every Amazon product I've tried so when I saw his I jumped on it immediately. Since then I've regretted it. I'm very tech savvy, particularly with Android and I've done everything imaginable to fix it but the phone app constantly closes without warning so when I want the Echo to do something it is not available.During the brief times it does work, it often activates itself when advertising it's own services. That's to say it'll say something like ""If you want more of this, just say the phrase Alexa..."" Then it stops before finishing the sentence because it woke itself up. I have multiple Echos in my house and I've never seen this happen. Maybe off of a TV but not itself.",2,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"Anything you can do with your echo, you can do with Siri and possibly a better job. However, I bought this because it was on sale for $35 and I love my echo dot and my echo show that are strategically placed around my house for constant access to music, alarms and the like. The wake word I prefer is computer, it makes my Star Trek themed bedroom even more awe inspiring. What sucks about echo auto is that you cannot change the wake word to computer and Alexa keeps saying stuff like I don’t have a play list for some artists but then plays other artists. This doesn’t happen with my dot or my show and for reference I don’t have any playlists nor do I intend on making a playlist I just listen to random songs from my favorite artists.  Sound quality is fine it plays through your speakers. I might return it because I could just keep using Siri.",2,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"- Couldn't connect to my 4G tablet to use a larger screen for GPS.  Seems to allow phone devices only.- Voice recognition was sluggish compared to WiFi version.

"Ok, so it will do pretty much your dot will do. HOWEVER you're in your car and find yourself needing directions. You would THINK that you could ask Alexa for directions. NO, NO you CAN NOT.  Now,  I have a truck with a $ 1500 pioneer system in my car. With using Alexa on, I have to turn Alexa off/switch to map mode on my system GPS to get directions. During which.. you CAN NOT USE ALEXA!! What??? Thinking this had to be wrong, I researched today, ironically before I get the email to rate this, and found out that Alexa does not give directions. There are work arounds, but it involves pulling over and going into phone then into google or waze and getting directions. SO.. what is the point of Alexa in the car?  Also, ask for a gas  station near you.. Alexa will name some, but fail to be able to tell you how to get there. SO why ask name some gas stations near me? What good does that do you if you are in an unfamiliar area?? As far as the other things it can do, messages and emails, with a newer vehicle, the systems come with that function already, not to mention social media. Ok, you can listen to what music you want, tell it to make a schedule or a list, ask it stupid stuff.. just what ever you do.. don't ask it for directions..",2,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"This is a difficult review for me to make.

"These types of things tend to get a lot of negative reviews because it does sometimes take a bit of thought and effort to get them to work (and make them look pretty) with each individual's setup.  Yes, it can technically be plug and play but if you want to get the most out of it hardwire it in.  For my setup, I wired in a new power receptacle because the ones in the car do not turn off when the car does.  I hid the wires behind the stereo and now it looks really neat and I never have to worry about draining the battery if I don't unplug it.  It also leaves the existing receptacles open for other things as needed.  Again, I don't know if people buying these things want to do all that but for me $25.00 and a little work breathed some life into an old car.  I use mine for smart home devices, Amazon music and Sirius all in the car.  Couldn't ask for better.  Only gripe is when I first installed it the thing was hit or miss with automatically connecting and if it didn't I couldn't seem to do it manually without turning the device off and then on again.  I don't know if there was a software update or something along those lines but it seems to be working well and reconnecting on its own when needed.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift to myself to replace my non-working bluetooth in my 2013 BMW X1. I thought this will be perfect. It does in fact replace my broken bluetooth pretty well (although I must be on the correct ""Aux"" input on the stereo system) and adds some cool Alexa features too. I also use it when on the road traveling (especially through the mountains in the PNW) where I lose radio stations, I can play Iheart radio, or Pandora, etc. crystal clear! Awesome..The drawback however, is in the lack of clear audio for calls while driving (since my bluetooth is out, I use a 3.5mm audio cable going into my stereo system and use the bluetooth of the Echo, which should be fine). The road noise apparently over weighs the microphone (or microphones according to amazon) and comes out choppy and static-y on the other end. Works great when parked, or quiet in the car.. If this was fixed it'd be a home run! There's a few bugs here and there but overall works pretty well and can be fun on a long drive!",3,1,2020-1-8,1,0,1
"For transparency sake, I received this device as a freebie from my insurance company.  The device is integrated through your smart phone, so be sure to have your Alexa app installed on your phone.  The downside is that if you don't have cell coverage, your car Alexa won't work.  It took a good bit of time for the device to run through it's updates and integration, but after that works much like my home smart speakers.  Overall, it's great to have a smart speaker in the car.  It gives me added flexibility to listen to the car radio and still have the use of my bluetooth navigation (courtesy of Alexa).  It does, however, need to be atrached to a vent ... heat and electronics don't play well together so I'm careful to adjust airflow away from electronics - unless I'm running the AC.

I have an iPhone 7 Plus. Maybe it works better with android. Echo auto can’t send texts.

This seems to be a hardware limitation and a massive lack of planning on Amazon's part. You are unable to also set timers, something we use a ton of so that was a let down as well.As for the rest it works great, I got two and connect to both my vehicles. One Vehicle has bluetooth and it integrates somewhat well overall.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
Not impressed with this device. Every time I get into the car I have to pull of the app and hope it decides to connect and push a button in the app (emphasis on hope). If I spend more than 5 to 10 minutes out of the car I have to reconnect it and it will also regularly disconnect as I drive. Its a neat idea but it fails to be successful at recognizing my voice in the car. Better have the windows all the way up (even when not moving) and all music turned way down or it will not hear you. When it does it about 50% of the time it does not understand the command I gave it. I requested an invite before it was officially released so I have had it for some time and it just went down hill quickly. My google assistant on my phone is much better and I have been using that instead. The outdated ford sync system that I have in my car is a lot better as well.,1,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"While the Echo Auto has some nice features it is seriously lacking in volume intensity and navigation.  The cars stereo volume has to be set very high to hear music played through the Echo, and then if you switch to another music source you practically blow your eardrums out if you do not remember to lower the stereo volume first.The navigation leaves a lot to be desired also.  You cannot ask the Echo for a destination and expect to get verbal instructions, you have to activate the app in your cell phone after asking for directions, also 95% of the time when I ask for directions she cannot figure out where I want to go and 95% of the time a voice says, words to the effect,  ""it appears you are not navigating at this time"", and this is when I am on the move.  This thing needs some serious updates.  I use a Samsung s10e phone.",3,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"Product is stylish and should go with any car interior.  I have a couple of older vehicles, one does not have bluetooth.  Using the AUX input the sound quality is terrible and the volume is way low compared to my regular volume for the radio.  If I use bluetooth to connect the volume is also very low but each time Alexa kicks in to announce a turn while navigating I hear a pop before she speaks, could be my dated bluetooth connection on my radio.

"I typically do not write reviews but I know that this is a much anticipated release (including myself) and we were so excited to be able to purchase one HOWEVER, within two weeks of use we more than doubled our data usage (5.1GB) and ran over our data limit since we do not have an unlimited data plan, costing us at least another $20 per month to operate and the only thing we use that vehicle for is to commute 6 miles to work and back.  Unfortunately we were planning on purchasing 2 Echo Autos for each of our 5 adult children and spouses as upcoming holiday gifts but won't now since the data usage is so outrageous.  In fact, we'll be sadly returning ours for that reason.  In the meantime for those with unlimited data or do not care about usage....the Echo Auto was awesome to immediately connect to music streaming such as Sirius and the auto connect feature worked great for us however within a few days Alexa quit taking voice commands for phone calls and would only generate a confused response.  Ultimately,  not worth the price of data, will continue to stream music and make calls direct from phone to vehicle via bluetooth and will look at watch and GPS for other information.

It was not easy to configure even though I did not use any bluetooth to connect to the auto sound system, only an auxiliary cable.

This one brings two more with it, and mounting on a vent means they are running everywhere.  Would suggest a magnet or double-sided tape option where you could place the unit in an inconspicuous place and possibly increase the microphone performance so it fully integrates.

About every 5th time I get in the car, it refuses to connect or it indicates it is connected, but will not respond to verbal questions/commands. Sometimes turning it off, waiting a few seconds and turning it back on will get it to work, but often, I have to unplug it, wait a minute and plug it back in. It then connects right up and works flawlessly for the next several times. Every now and then, it will refuse to do anything except to repeat 3 times, ""to play music, connect via bluetooth,"" but bluetooth is on and connected and works for my phone and other blue-tooth-connected items. Again, have to turn Alexa off or unplug it to restart. When it works, it works great and I like it, but too often there are connection issues. My car is a top-of-the-line 2019 model which works great with other items connecting so it has nothing to do with the car. If I had it to do over, I'd just use Alexa on my smart-phone and save my money by not buying this. Maybe a 2nd or 3rd generation version will be better.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

I got the Amazon auto couple month ago as a early invite promotion. Since I do love most Amazon Alexa items thought I would try it. I have a 2016 ltz Silverado which already had bluetooth and voice commands but felt this my offer even more. After the first day I kept having problems with it staying connected for some reason I had to keep adding it as if it's the first time I installed it. I finally thought I got that all worked out however less then a week later it wouldnt connect I kept holding down the button so the alexa auto would reboot and the orange light just kept moving and moving after 10 to 15 min still same thing it's like it frozen...I've tried several times since then with no luck.  My son drives a 2014 nissan maxima I'm gonna install it in his car tomorrow see if I can at least get it to work... so far it's not a favorite amazon echo product I wanted to love it I was excited to try it so far it just is a little bit of a let down..,2,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0

"Having been an early adopter of the Alexa-on-the-road concept, I was excited to see that Amazon had chosen to jump into the market.  I had previously purchased a Roav VIVA which plugs into the 12v power (cigarette lighter) outlet and performs the similar function of bridging your smart phone to your car's bluetooth.The Auto was announced back in December of 2018 and was slowly rolled out in beta to select Amazon shoppers.  After waiting for what seemed an eternity since I requested the invitation, I received my invitation to buy the Auto about a month ago and made the switch.",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I was one of the folks who got the chance to buy the Echo Auto early, so I did. Little did I know that the transaction also forced an “air vent clip” on me at additional cost. I also didn’t realize that this thing requires multiple extra wires and cables, including power and USB in to car audio (my car has BT, but this would never connect to it), and then of course the cables run all over the driver’s cockpit. THEN of course, you have to have your phone magically connected to some triad of phone-device-car in order for it to work. THEN it will do things for you that most more recent cars will do anyway, like “Alexa, play XM radio channel 23” (or, I could just press the XM button on my dash and tune in to 23). “Alexa, get the weather” (or I could use XM Weather OR just check my phone’s widget screen when I’m stopped at a red light or at my destination). Basically, I found it to be an awful lot of gobbledygook and frustration for something that’s too fragile a mixture of devices, too stringy a physical connection and offers too little of actual value while driving along on the road.I can see where some people who are SOOOO into the “Echo lifestyle” just could not live their precious little lives without it, and so I won’t say “don’t get this.” Those are also the people from whom I generally flee at cocktail parties, but it’s a free country (for now). If you NEED Alexa... if you have separation anxiety every time you’re without her reassuring voice... maybe this makes sense. It doesn’t exactly break the bank, so if it makes you happy to have one, go crazy with it. But wireless voice-controlled auto devices have been around for a while as have car speaker phones, and you don’t have to find special radio frequencies on your car dial to use them as such, either. I find so little value in the limited things you can do with this device and so much hassle in setting up, connecting and using, it didn’t take me long to decide to send it back and declare the experiment in my car to be a failure. It is just not revolutionary the way the home Echo was when it first came out and probably needs some major rethinking along the lines of paradigm-disrupting if it’s ever going to go anywhere. This doesn’t even ask the paradigm for a cigarette and compliment its dress.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Let's face it. Alexa is kinda dumb.  She is good at turning on lights and talking to your fancy doorbell, but she doesn't know much.  If you want answers to questions get a Google or a Siri to talk to.  HOWEVER, I bought the Auto-Echo specifically because Tennessee passed a new law about phone usage while driving and I had no idea they wouldn't enforce it.  Alexa is actually quite good at making phone calls through my car stereo system.  And when I bored in the car, she can be fun to talk to. Try saying: ""Alexa, Simon Says..."" She will repeat short phrases in her happy voice, which can be quite entertaining.Note of caution though, the Auto-Echo works off your phone's data plan, so if you aren't unlimited you can find yourself going over if you aren't careful.  Of course the phone calls don't use data, they are just phone calls.",4,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"Set-up was easy although initially it regularly lost its Bluetooth connection.  Much better now.  This may have been an IOS 13 beta issue rather than Echo Auto.  It seems to be fine now.My is, and why I say not ready for prime time, is that the device is little more than something to ensure you keep your phone hands-free when driving. Yes it will do regular Alexa chores but the use currently seems a bit limited in the car.  If you have a car with Google or Apple car play, the Echo Auto doesn't offer much.  It offers a bit more value if your car doesn't have these features.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I really wanted to love this, however it is flawed.First off I have to disconnect my phone from my U Connect in my Jeep otherwise it will not play through my speakers. This bummed me out because I was really hoping to get rid of the big ol' cords coming out of this thing. No such luck, I disconnected my phone from U Connect and it worked fine but now I have the cords hanging off my dash.",2,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Really disappointed with this so far. Basically, the only thing I can use it for is playing music, and I have a car radio for that! I was excited to have the ability to ask Alexa for the weather or add things to my grocery shopping list while driving, but those features have not worked at all. Anytime ""alexa"" tries to ""talk,"" her voice is just cut out and I never hear a complete sentence. When asking her to play a song, she ends up talking over herself and again, cutting out then until the actual song starts. When I say ""talking over herself,"" it's like she's trying to say two things at once, such as ""Playing [song] from your library"" and also ""playing [song] from Amazon Music,"" but neither of those sentences are complete, because the second starts before the first is finished. If i ask for the weather, she will start to answer, but after about 4 words, she is cut off and I hear no more. I use bluetooth on my car regularly with my phone and have never had any issues talking to Siri, so this cannot be simply a bluetooth connection issue. It's something more, and so far, it's very disappointing. Certainly does not live up to the Alexa I have come to expect from our other devices at home.",1,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"To me it was basically just a hands-free device. To work, it needs the Alexa app, through which it can be configured. What disappointed me was finding out that all the work is done through the phone. The phone plays the audio through the car's Bluetooth, it runs the alexa skill/app through the phone. The echo works as a microphone to pick up the command, then relays that back to the phone to do all the work.I thought this would be something like an alexa speaker for your car minus the speaker part and the phone would serve only as a the data connection. Nope. It's just a hands-free device with a few alexa extras. Ask alexa for directions and you still have to confirm the information on your phone.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
This device is the same as a echo dot minus the speaker or ability to connect to WiFi. There is one big difference and that is that you can't change the wake word. This is terrible for me because my niece's name is Alexa.The device setup was not that easy since I had to unplug it for 30 seconds then plug it back in to get the voice recognition to work. It doesn't tell you this anywhere in the app that this needs to be done.,1,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"Clearly the only drawback for this device is you MUST have cell data in order for it to work.  Other than that, it is a really useful device.  You can ask it how far you are from a business or attraction and it will give you a reasonable estimate of how far away you are.  It will provide some turn by turn directions and those directions have been reliable so far, but given the fact that you can loose cell data in rural areas, a standalone GPS is probably best for that task.  For Amazon Music and Alexa commands, you can't beat it.  I have noticed, however, that pretty much anytime I ask for the current temp, the audio drops off and often you have to ask Alexa to repeat the forecast or local temp.  This may be a Blue Tooth thing, but might be something Amazon could look into to improve an already good product.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"My experience with the Auto is ""The Auto with a curl"".  When it works, it works good.  When it's bad....1. If your car has a Bluetooth connection, the sound uses your car stereo .

"I have an old work car that doesn’t have Bluetooth or any fancy equipment. I like to listen to a few sports talk radio stations that don’t always come in clear in the mornings and Alexa allows me to use Radio.com from my phone and the static is gone. It’s nice to have access to my amazon music library. It’s also nice to be able to turn lights on at night in the house from the driveway with Alexa and the smart plugs.My wife drives a newer Ford Flex Limited with all the bells and whistles, it has its own system to connect to smart phones. I don’t feel this set up would be worth buying for it as I feel it would be redundant.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0

I've had my auto for a while now and I do like it. It is not perfect but it has some nice features that come in handy. I have used it to play iheart radio and siriusxm. It works pretty good. On occasion the connection can get flaky and the music will stop. Not sure if that is a carrier network issue or a problem. On the highway it is pretty reliable for me. A key feature for me keeping it was being able to pop up directions on the fly using waze by just asking how do I get to wherever. I used to have to pull over. It can send and receive voice texts and make calls hands free. Hanging up is tricky though and not hands free. One feature it lacks is not playing music stored on your phone. I think it is supposed to be able to stream from plex but I have not figured how to get it to work. I liked it enough to buy one for my wife.,4,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"Love this device. Game changer for me. My vehicle and other general motor vehicles 2013 and older have Bluetooth that allows for calls but not playing media through car speakers. I used a 5ft aux cord for years. I had to replace scratchy sounding cords and it was ugly since plug goes into armrest. The echo auto allows me to talk on phone through Bluetooth, and send media through aux at same time. Playing music and my audio books on my car is so simple now. No cords and Cables hanging around. I can have the echo next to the armrest.  Just start car, start media (radio stays on aux now😁) and drive. Sound is better than old way. Plus I can access Amazon music and play verbal games with Alexa. She is a bit cranky, wanting specific commands in order.

When on long car rides, the kids enjoy playing trivia games, and I like being able to add things to my list as I am thinking of them without having to access my phone which is wonderful, and lawful while driving.Overall, I am quite happy with the device.

"The voice recognition while driving is excellent. The build quality is pretty good, but I feel that it is too large and having the cable routing be attached by an adhesive is a poor choice (in my car the adhesive melted and does not stay properly on).I do not see the purpose of this product when you can just use the phone to do the same thing (it does require a phone connection to the Alexa app on the phone). Granted, it does pickup the wake up word really well, but it seems like a bloated product if all it does is have a good mic (ie a dedicated hardware button that could be attached to a steering wheel or dash that would trigger Alexa on the phone would be a better option).",3,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0

"I absolutely LOVE my Echo products in my home. They've made life exactly how my 10-year-old self imagined life in the 21st century would be: I can ask Alexa what foods and plants are toxic to my animals, convert measurements, play music in every room, turn on lights, etc., etc. Why I thought adding Echo Auto to my 2019 vehicle was a good idea, I have no clue. I guess I was so blinded by its usefulness around the home that I wanted to take that convenience with me everywhere.But I didn't stop to think... I already have the Alexa app on my phone and bluetooth in my car. There is absolutely no need for an additional product to do what my phone and car already do. Not only that, but Echo Auto is technologically cumbersome. I had to yell commands even though the device was literally right in front of me (I drive a Honda Fit, so it's not a huge car). After I started using the Echo, my car quit recognizing voice commands; I had to turn off the device and re-record names to their corresponding phone numbers. When I did make a call through the Echo, the sound quality was so horrible that I had to turn up my speakers nearly full volume. Another thing that I just found really annoying was that I had to re-start the app every single time I got in my car. When I just connect through bluetooth, I don't have to do that. To summarize, there is just really no point at all in having this device in a newer model car.",2,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

Only thing I can't quite get used to is when you talk to Alexa, it takes 1-2 seconds to respond allowing me to make a command (unlike the indoor version what responds immediately on the wake up word. Really cool is that it knows where you are, so you can ask for the weather and it reports on where you are (not your home location). Not to mention all the Alexa Skills you have loaded which works as well. I use it to have communications with my wife through Alexa using the ""Call"" feature or ""Announce"" feature.

I may be able to have my hotspot on my phone running and have the FileHub connect to that so that internet remains Available to alexa. I’m listening to my favorite authors and radio hosts as well as making hands free calls, getting timely weather, getting directions, checking delivery status, adding to lists. Overall far more useful than expected. Only complaint is that it infrequently doesn’t establish a connection as quick as expected, I’m left to resolve the issue at the side of of the road.

"While I have had the Echo Auto for awhile now, I wanted to wait and see what others were saying before stating my opinion.  I have enjoyed having Alexa within the confines of my truck.  I have enjoyed the ease of access within the setup instructions, but I can see where some individuals have found the setup a little difficult if one is not used to Bluetooth devices sometimes not finding one another.  I have asked Alexa tremendous amounts of questions, i.e. directions, business hours, weather, playlists, dad jokes, news updates etc. She has been spot on with all of my requests.  The only downsides that I have noticed are the lack of space available to get air out of my truck vent from the mount, my OEM truck radio wanting to have issues with the Bluetooth connection, and Alexa seeming to take a break randomly while answering a question.

"This works most of the time on my Google Pixel XL 2 phone and my Alpine aftermarket car stereo. It generally can recognize speech pretty well, and can follow most commands just like my echo at home. The only issue, and it is a fairly significant one, is sometimes it does not respond through the car stereo. I can see the blue light noting it is responding, and I'm sure it's giving an answer, it just doesn't come through on my car stereo. When I open the Alexa app and do the sound test then it works fine. And many other times it also works fine. But randomly, it doesn't. With so many different car stereos, car stereo models, and phones, admittedly it will be tough to make a product that works with all of them.

It would have made a nice handsfree calling device except that the microphones picks up the audio from the speakers and callers get to hear themselves as an echo. That's probably the biggest mark against it at $25.

Second the Auto bluetooth interface kept dropping if it connected at all. Last its dash holder design only works with square /oblong vents. Really?  I asked for a return but unfortunately forgot to mail it back in time so I am stuck with it. I’ve taken a few different shots at getting it working properly but its just a mess.

The install was a breeze however placing on air vent did leave that vent stuck in fixed position. No biggie however initially was very impressed but whenever I had someone in Car it was in need to it to work, it will force to connect. Another big set back, with several microphones, simple phone call quality at the reviver end is not good enough. Alexa sometime will just give up and won’t respond.

"At first I was super excited.  Set up was simple and it seemed to work great.  I was able to mount it where it is all but unnoticeable.  The problem is 97% or more of the time, it does not reconnect when I start the car.  The 3% or less of the time that it does reconnect automatically, I cannot touch, move, or breath on my phone between stopping and starting the car; AND the time between can't be more than like 7 minutes.  Even then it still isn't likely to reconnect.  So I usually end up having to open the app, unplug the devise, restart the phone, etc. etc. etc. until it finally connects--not very safe while trying to drive.  Very often I give up and move on to satellite or something else.That said, when it is up and running I really like the convenience of being able to control music and ask Alexa questions.  My only real complaint (when it's up and running), is relatively minor--you can't see the album art on your car stereo screen like you can when going directly through Pandora or other Apps.

After a while it may start working with no extra effort from my side. That means poor connectivity.,1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"For an Amazon Device, this certainly wasn't an easy set up. Days later, I still haven't got all of the functions down. Playback through my stereo is random. And there are various other oddities, such as the time Siri and Alexa somehow decided they both needed to give me directions from different navigation apps. That was weird.Right now, the Car Echo is better than the Roav Viva, but mostly because it sits up high where it can hear me. Unlike most of my Echos, this one did not come pre-configured with my account info, and there was no warning, from the device, the instructions, or my app, that the app would need to be updated for me to set up the new device.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"If you have a car that supports Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, you should use those products instead. However, this is a great device to add to an older car with an audio aux input.I have an old clunker of a car, without built-in bluetooth for phone connectivity or in-dash display, and any of that fancy stuff. But the Echo Auto finally brings my car into the 21st Century. I can finally stream music from my favorite services, or take a hands-free phone call that actually sounds good, or ask Alexa questions, or even interact with my connected smart-home.",4,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"Disclaimer: My entire house is hooked up to Alexa.. I love having motion and voice controlled lights, tv's, timers, clocks you name it! When I saw that Alexa was coming to an Automobile application, I signed up for the Beta immediately..Performance wise, even the Beta version has worked perfectly since day 1! It takes a few seconds to connect when I get in and start my car, only because I don't keep the device in my ""Always On"" plug in my car. I plug it into the one that comes on once I turn my car on.",5,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
"This little device works pretty well!  Picks up on voice command key words fairly reliably... Alexa ""herself"" seems to need a bit of AI expansion juice, though. Her capabilities are somewhat limited compared to other voice assistants.Picked up sound is a bit noisy folks report (from phone calls), but the playback through the car audio is very clear and easy to adjust.  I'm using the analog cable in my old car's AUX jack instead of a bluetooth connection.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I was part of the pre purchase program. I am an Alexa guy, and own every possible device in my home. I thought it would be terrific to have Alexa in my car. First the mount is awful, the glue gave out after 1 day on the cord keeper. The vent mount is clumsy and does not take into account that most vents are recessed, and the plug is not long enough, plus it's difficult to see the light on the device. It was difficult to get it set up, and when you do it's not that responsive. I carry 2 phones with me, and I started it on my personal phone, but it got confused with the 2 phones, so I changed it to my work phone. When it does respond, it will not let the radio return to it's last function so you have to change your input back to what you were listening to before you asked Alexa a question. It's a great idea, but needs a lot of work. I hope Amazon will heed the reviews and go back to the drawing board. Great idea, poor execution.",3,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"Was able to get this product one week early thanks to Amazon. My car is not equipped with Bluetooth audio so this seemed like a good way to not only cut the cord on my phone to my auxiliary input, but also have Alexa integration to truly have a hands-free experience. So my initial impressions were very positive. It's small and thin which is nice because where I put it, it won't block my vision of my clock or radio screen. The adhesive pad that it comes with is magnetic on one side for the device to sit on which means that it can be easily moved in case you leave your windows down in a parking lot or a shady neighborhood. The USB cord and aux cord that it comes with has more than enough length to put it anywhere you want on your dash or vent area. Now here's where I'm a bit disappointed. The Bluetooth connection is....fine. On my particular unit I have noticed that every so often there are quick little glitches that happen where it almost sounds like the Echo is refreshing the connection. It's short and quick but it's still rather annoying because the audio will cut out for about half a second. The microphone is pretty decent as it has EIGHT of them to make sure that it can pick up your voice from any angle you might have it at, and it's decent quality so people on the other end if you make phone calls with it can easily understand you. The Alexa app is the most frustrating part of it though due to the fact that it doesn't recognize any of my playlists in Apple Music or the fact that you have to go through ONE by ONE in your contacts to get it to recognize any call-outs you make. So the device itself, is great. I find that it helps me check my physical phone less, and can keep all my attention on the road where it should be. Once Alexa has the bugs figured out on a cleaner, better phone experience, I'll be much happier. Right now, I'd say I'm content.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"Owning every Amazon device the Amazon Echo doesn’t disappoint. The set up was easily paired. If there is anything that I found difficult was anchoring the Amazon Auto on the mount that attaches to the air vents on the dash. It took a little time but finally figured it out. In my opinion, they need to figure out a better device. The Echo Auto works flawlessly. Using my Amazon music I can play all of my downloaded Amazon music. I have Sirius XM but with this device I really don’t need it. What ever you like on your Echoes at home your going to love what you can do on your Amazon Auto. When I arrive home I tell Alexa to turn on the lights in my home, then tell Alexa to open my garage door. I look forward to seeing what improvements Amazon comes up with. Would I recommend this device? Yes I would. Is there room for improvement? Of course which is exciting because any and all improvements will be available to you.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto is definitely a Beta device. It is very glitchy and I find I have to unplug it when I am not using it because it undermines my car's built in Bluetooth functionality. When it can find a signal, which is also an issue, it plays Internet Radio really well but if I happen to get a phone call while the Echo Auto is active, I can't hear the call and they can't hear me. As soon as the phone rings, I need to unplug the Echo before answering the call. I have to assume Amazon offered the Echo Auto to Alexa Super Users (I have more than 10 other Echo devices) so we could use them and they could track our usage to work out the glitches. If this is true, they haven't given us any extra support to help deal with these issues. So, by going under the mindset that I am Beta-testing this device, I am able to put up with all of its issues.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I can't stress enough how much I love this device. It was a pain having to actually open the app to change a song or do simple things. With this, I don't have to anymore. It was an easy connection with bluetooth. The only time it disconnects is if by some weird reason I don't have service in an area. The device turns on as soon as I turn on my truck. It connects about 2 seconds afterwards. She recognizes my voice and responds quickly. One thing that I figured out was if you have the device in direct sunlight, the device WILL get hot and it won't work. When this had happened, I took it off the charger and put it in front of the ac to cool it off. Once cooled, I plugged it back in and it worked like new. I sometimes keep a microfiber cloth on top of it when I know it'll be in the sun as a precautionary measure. Hasn't ""heated up"" since. I will be buying a couple others for my son and husband.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
Didn’t come with explicit installation instructions. I was very frustrated trying to get it to work. Almost sent it back however by luck I got it to work. I am older close to 70. Most of us are not technical.I don’t like the fact that you have to turn your cell phone volume down every time you want to use Alexa. I am thinking that Amazon will improve on this flaw with newer versions.,3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

"Update: I have grown tired of using this in my car and plan to get rid of it before the week ends. My data for my phone is costing me too much because of the required data that the echo auto uses.This was the one thing I waited so badly for. I submitted an invitation over two years ago to get this for my car. Every day, I would hope that I could get this for my trips. I got so tired of waiting and then finally got my echo auto in my hands. The first thing I thought was “I love this idea” but then started to hate this. My phone can do what Alexa can so much better. I ended up just putting her in my glove box, until the release to the public was made. Connection sucks, the music with Spotify needs to change (Spotify app has to be open and running to work right), and GPS needs to be more than asking to open my phone GPS. Amazon, I have so many Alexa products and love them so much! But echo auto, I’m not impressed and might just get rid of it.",1,1,2019-10-10,1,1,0
"I have an Echo Dot & a Show5 at home and I'm am very impressed with all that I can do with those devices.  I love using them!!  But the Echo Auto just sits on my dash.  When I say ""next song"" (while using Spotify), it replies ""I cannot do that"". (it can on my home devices!)  I have not figured out if I can connect the alexa to the Car Navigation system.  (although phone Nav works)  So I have found that I use it rarely while driving.  I suppose I will occasionally ask a question, but it's hardly worth the loss of use of the air vent that it's attached to.  The little wire manager on the lower air vent mount pulled off of the mount the 1st day of use.  Glue is all that holds it there.  It would have been nice to have a permanent attachment.  My car already had Android Auto, listens to voice commands and has Navigation.  I think the Echo Auto would be a BIG WIN if your car does not have Bluetooth.  In that case you would gain voice commands, have Navigation and take/make phone calls hands free.  So I think it's a good product, but it's just not very beneficial for me.  Hope this helps if you're considering buying one.",3,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"I have been using the Echo Auto for a week now. My 2003 Honda Element doesn't have a bluetooth radio, so I have it plugged into the Aux port. It is awesome, though I have only used it to play music (from YouTube and streaming app radios) and made phone calls thus far. There is NO engine noise and it is able to cancel out a lot of the car noise, though I'm not sure how much since I'm the one on the noisy end (Elements are pretty loud with road and wind noise). I'll have to let someone else call me while driving my car to test it fully. This is the most ideal item out there! Great build and awesome technology inside of it.For those that have put your name in the list, I put my name in the list when it first became available and of course 8 months later...when I was out of the country (and not checking my personal email...only business emails), I missed my invitation. So, instead of saying anything, complaining, or whatever...I just put my name back into the list. The 2nd time I only had to wait a 4 months to be able to buy it. Just be patient.

Great, thought it was now all set up & couldn’t wait to try it out, later I went out to the car & it wouldn’t connect so I started the process all over again, only took 15 minutes this time.  Then while driving it kept stopping in the middle of a song & I kept having to say “Alexa resume” and it would start again.  Found out I cannot use the Waze’s app while I’m also using it, every time Waze’s say something Alexa disconnects.  Multiple times she will say trying to connect or can’t find Bluetooth.

"I have always preferred Alexa to other assistant devices. I live in TN where we have hands free laws. Trying to find a good hands free system has been frustrating. I believe echo auto will be our answer. We do not have a Bluetooth radio, so we are using the aux cord. Not had any problem with it. We have my phone and my husband's phone linked with it and it is working just fine unless one of our phones run too low on battery. Then it gets frustrating to switch to the other phone. Basically it is whomever gets to the car first. A few things that could be improved would be call quality. 1. Making calls through the echo auto still has a slight echo effect to the sound quality like two kids talking through a drainage tube. 2. It would be nice if it was chargeable rather than corded only. 3. I would love to mount it over my rearview mirror like the old speed detectors. I am pretty sure the back seat passengers would have an easier time playing the games as Alexa has a hard time hearing them. All in all we are quite pleased for a first gen device.",4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
I kinda wish I got the Bluetooth Alexa device for stereo speakers. Echo auto doesn’t always respond when we give a command. And she doesn’t always do what we ask of her.

I love being able to listen to my AUDIBLE account anywhere in my house, I use it for my notifications and alarms and in my car it's great to be able to make calls hands free and get directions and such, I just wish Alexa had more knowledge than she does.

"Ordered the echo auto. Setting up was easy and I have not experienced any proble with reconnecting afterwards lime previous reviews.

Voice quality is good, I have some hearing loss and do not always have my hearing aid but no problem hearing and understanding response.The vent mount in my opinion is not very good, engineers could have put some thought into improving the way to mount this, I personally plan to cut the piece that alexa sits on (magnet) off and then get the 3 M velcro sticky to monut it on the dash in front of me.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I was very excited to see that Amazon came out with this product, since the hands-free system in my car is difficult to use. I received it as a birthday present through the invitation, but I agree with the other reviews that this device is definitely not worth more than $25. I've had it for about 4 months now and there are a few things I like, but it still has a lot of problems.1. First off, it's important to know that you cannot change the wake word on this device, which means you must call her Alexa. My name is Alexa so I was very frustrated to discover this. All of the Echo devices can be changed to respond to either Echo or Amazon so there's absolutely no reason why this shouldn't be an option on the Echo Auto as well. This is a simple thing that should have been added in the first place!",3,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I found this device a little unneeded. I was expecting to have a full Alexa device in my car, but encountered that it is just a mic to the iPhone app. It needs to have the phone in reach and the Alexa app running. In fact, if it is paired to one person phone, and someone else is driving, this device is useless unless it is paired again to the person that is now in the car cellphone. It is a petty that it wasn’t take to the level where this device is a full echo device (no need for speakers like the big brothers or anything similar, it just needs to be a stand alone independed device). Was disappointed to understand that this is actually useless in my case (and others i presume(.

"The device sometimes does not connect to the phone immediately. Some of that due to my phone switching from WiFi to cellular data when my car gets away from the house. That handoff is clunky.

Center top of dash is best.Basically the box is a microphone, Bluetooth connection and a cardboard speaker that uses the phone to do all the heavy lifting.

"Overall this is an ok product, but it doesn’t excel at anything. Asking Alexa for the weather and other tasks that she performs outside the car usually works fine. The Bluetooth functionality is good and Alexa sounds clear in my speakers.Navigating is lacking. It can’t give me a simple answer to “how long will it take to get home?”  I need to ask to navigate home, tap the notification on my iPhone, and then look at my phone for the estimate from google maps. I wonder if Android phones let you skip any of these steps (although they probably want you to use Android Auto).",3,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"This worked great...for about about 4 days.  I thought it was going to be a keeper, so I threw away the box, the paperwork, everything that came with it.  The echo must have known as soon as the trash truck came and took the trash, because shortly after that, it started giving me all sorts of problems. At times, I could be sitting in the car with no music and the air barely blowing and I would say ""Alexa"" several times and it would never respond.  When it finally would respond, it would start to do what I told it to do, then would just stop, and do nothing.  Other times, it could not connect to my phone, via Bluetooth, when it was less than 2 inches away from it.  Then, when I am on the phone, getting out of the truck holding the phone in my hand, it would suddenly connect and the phone call would start going through the truck as I am walking away.  Several times I would ask it to play the Audible book I am listening to, and instead of it picking up where I last left off, it would start the book over again.  When I have the phone connected via a cable doing Apple carplay, this never happens.  It only worked for a few days, then it was a horrible waste of money.  Its a good thing I only paid $25 for it because now it is in the trash, soon to join the box and everything else that came with it.  This is a great idea, but a poor poor execution.  Avoid buying this, dont waste your money.",1,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"My auto insurance company paid for this, so I can't complain about the price. But I can say this product is not ready for prime time. The volume level is inconsistent. For example, your normal conversing with Alexa is at a good volume, then she plays music or gives directions at a lower barely audible volume. So you have to constantly adjust things just to hear. I was impressed with her microphones and ability to hear. But messy cables all over the place, a lame air vent holder... and or what? Music? We already have ways to play music and get directions in our cars. This adds nothing. This may be a good product one day BUILT-IN, but as an accessory, it provides no good benefit and is frustrating to use.

It looks so cheap and straight out of the 90s. I wouldn’t mind the connection issues if it was better looking and did a little more. I’d rather have my phone open I’m the amazon music app and let Alexa stream through my phone’s Bluetooth connection. I’m shocked they even released this device.

I subscribe to Amazon music and audio book services, and thought that it would be a great solution for rush hour commutes.  When this works, it is great.  The problem is that it fails more than it works, and i cant figure out why.  If you hit a dead zone, it disconnects, then you have to start over from where you originally began.  Seems like something easily fixed, but they havent.  Worst still, is that it often disconnects for no reason at all.  Full bars for cell coverage, sunny day etc.  I can use every other app on my phone and car apple play, but not alexa.  For what i paid for two of these devices, i feel cheated.

When it works it's great makes pulling up maps or playing music very fast and easy and is super nice when pulling up to my house to ask her to turn in lights. The issue comes down to connectivity I would say on a given day it auto connects 50% of the time with the other 50% i have to take some other action to actually get it to connect. This has happened with my Android phone and my wife's iPhone so it's not an issue of phone as far as I can tell. Therein lies the problem this is supposed to be a convience and not a hassel which it is when it connects up automatically but when it doesn't it's not worth the fuss. With full disclosure I didn't purchase this myself I received it as a gift from work so if your in my shoes and you didn't pay for it or pay close to full price it's worth it.

Instead, I tell Alexa to play a song and it's about 50/50 if it actually works and if it does its 50/50 if it will play the whole song without pausing because ""I lost signal"" . It seems if as if my strength of signal weakens by 1 bar it considers that a loss of internet and cannot play.  Better to use the app via my phone.

Well...I turned that thing over, and under, around and around...There ain't no icon like that anywhere on there...Just that off button...and that other button that has that white dot on it...whatever the thunder that is. So...I mashed that off button and yelled ""HEY ALEXA!!!ARE YOU WORKING NOW!"" And she confirmed to me in her soft kind voice that she was and that if I needed any technical...bla, bla, bla.

"When I got my Toyota Sienna, I paired my android phone with it.  It worked ok, but when playing videos, there was a significant lag in the audio.  So I put an Echo Dot in the Sienna and connected it to the radio AUX input. Then connected the Dot to my phones hotspot and my phones bluetooth to the Dot.  This worked much better.  The lag was gone and Alexa was available to answer questions and play music.  The downside was that I had to remember to turn on my hotspot and the boot up/connection time for the Dot was a little slow.  Also, the Dot produced a pretty loud audio ""pop"" as it was booting up everytime.Enter the Echo Auto!  I replaced the Dot with the Echo auto, also wired to the cars AUX input and powered by the cars USB port.  The Echo Auto came with a handy air vent mount with wire management which was much better than the Echo Dot sitting in a cup holder.  The echo dot is paired with the phone via bluetooth and accesses the internet through this connection as well.  No need for a hotspot.

"Okay, brass tacks right? It’s cool has lots of potential and once you discover how to get the most out of it, could really be nice to have in the car, especially if you’re a fan of your home Echo’s and use them quite a bit. If you simply ask your Echo for weather and the time, or to play the occasional tune this would be something that’s going to collect dust in your car. I find when I get in the car and plug it in it takes far too long to sync and get going, once it is though you can get a lot out of it especially if you have a lot of your devices, lights, music, SiriusXM, etc., running through your Echo devices.

"Echo Auto had the potential to be cool, but it's not. It only works if you have your car audio system setup to listen to your cel. phone's audio via bluetooth. I don't use my cel. phone to listen to music (in my car or elsewhere). I listen to the XM radio in my car, so Alexa's responses to commands/requests cannot be heard. I suppose you can set it up to play through the car's hard-wired audio jack, but I'd need to have the car radio setup to listen to that audio jack, and again, I don't do that! If I did want to listen to bluetooth or audio jack, it'd require constant data usage. I have unlimited data, but I don't choose to use it that way. I'm sad that the Echo Auto can't (or doesn't) use its own internal speaker. I can't get it to do navigation at all. Siri's better in many ways for in-car operations. The other problem is the mounting clip that ONLY works on the A/C vent! Come on! I live in Arizona! I cannot afford to block the cool air coming out of my car's air conditioning system in summertime! There simply MUST be some better way to deal with this problem!",2,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I love this Echo Auto!  I placed it in my pick up truck and I use it daily!  I didn't care for the vent mount, so I cut it down and used two sided tape and placed it on my steering column.  I decided to use the auxiliary cable and use an extra speaker I had sitting around.  I didn't want to use Bluetooth or the auxiliary cable to connect to my radio because when I am listening to music, it is too hard to switch inputs to aux or bt, the buttons on my radio are too tiny!  Works perfectly!  I love being able to add to our shopping list, getting weather updates, and sports updates.  One of the best features is being able to make phone calls via the Echo Auto!  Works great, crystal clear!  I can also send text messages via Auto too!  Set up was pretty easy.  Overall I really appreciate this unit!",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"I am used to Alexa and have some sort of device in just about every room in the house, so the car was a no brainer.  It was easy to insall and my car a 2012 Mini Cooper has icon for external bluetooth device so no problems getting it into my radio speakers.  It is nice because as a Sirius XM subscriber I can stream on the Alexa and get the bonus channels, I also have the Amazon music subscitption so I can pull up songs no problems.  Getting directions was a tad tedious and to cancel them took several tries.  Also some serious lags in music at times which is the 4 stars.  Sound wise I am better off tuning into the Sirus XM than using Alexa but the ease of calling up music and switching stations was pretty easy.My Alexa was not sticky enough to attach to the dash board so for an xtra $5 I paid for double sided 3M tape and it does well.  It blends into my black dash so thats its not very noticeable.",4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"I’ve owned many amazon products Over the past few years and although I never loved them, the sound quality was decent enough to keep me using them to listen to music or catch up on the weather and news. I was really excited for the Echo Auto to come out so I could update my car with it. It was such a huge disappointment that it has completely turned me off of all amazon products and Alexa altogether. Alexa was horrible with it. I would give it the same command over and over and it never got anything right. When I told it to play a specific radio station, it never played the same station twice, it always picked a different one not matter how specific I was to it. It is such a disaster of a product, and such a frustrating piece of crap, that it got thrown out the window while at the dump. That’s where it belongs.....in a pile of decomposing crap like all of the other rushed to market pieces of crap that amazon brings to market.",1,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"I love the Echo Dot and when the Auto came out I couldnt have been happier. Sadly the happiness left me once I used it. Like others the Alexa App has to be open to use Alexa and if it stays connected it works very well, WHEN it stays connected...BUT it is nice to have Bluetooth in my non Bluetooth car and it would be nice if the Auto had a stand alone Alexa built OR pause/play and skip froward buttons so if your not connected to the app you could still skip music or pause or any other kinda simple task but sadly this left me wanting much more. If asked to buy again I wouldnt unless some major changes/updates came into it. If you dont mind playing music with your devise and just use the Bluetooth its great to not have to plug your phone in which is how I use it. Easy to install nice and slim so it can go just about anywhere.",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"I received this free from my nationwide insurance company for being a loyal supporter... so I did not have to buy this... good thing I didn't because I myself had a hard time figuring this out... the directions are useless, there are steps missing when telling you how to connect... I did lose connections often... make sure you do have internet access.I have not tested how accurate it is talking to the echo auto yet, because I spend too much time trying to set up... but I finally have it connected, only thing now is when I turn off car to go in house or store and return later, I have to set up again... So cannot recommend this... maybe there will be some updates to correct this in future, I think amazon released this to soon, compared to the original Alexa & echo, they work just great.",2,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"I have had two of these.  I kept the older one for the truck, but the mounting system on that one was fine.  The newer ones have a vent mounting kit  has limited compatibility and is likely incompatible with your vents.  Even if it fits, it could do damage to your vents and repairs will be expensive.  Not only that, but do you really want to block a vent for this?  Beyond that, he functionality is poor.  Using the phone function, people tell me the microphone is bad and the call quality poor.  So the final thing would be asking questions, but anyone with one of these devices will tell you it gets ""confused"" a lot and answers question with completely different topics.  ""Alexa, turn on computer""  Response, I can't find heater.  Or the dreaded, I did not find any skill  would you like to try...  And it is hard to get the echo to shut up when it goes off track like this for about 30 some seconds...  Echo does not respond to shut up.",1,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I put this in my 2013 Hyundai Accent using Bluetooth connection and my Samsung Galaxy A20. It connects the same as my phone did before it, about a minute after my car is turned on. It stays connected, it took less than five minutes to set up. It works a lot like a Dot with the added ability to give directions and such using your phone apps. It now allows me to use both my Google Assistant and Alexa hands-free in my car. I had used the hands-free option with the music app before this but this has more features and the microphone array works so much better than my handsfree setup on my phone and car. Just for the heck of it I also hardwired using the input on my stereo and that took less than 2 minutes. Not sure what system you could have on most cars made in the last 20 years this doesn't easily work with.",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
I'm not one to early adopt products but I've been using Echo devices at home for a while so I went in for the invite on the Echo Auto. I'm glad I did. I have a basic Bluetooth car stereo so I was hoping for something to replace the lousy mic on that but unfortunately it still relies on the stereo Bluetooth for calling. Otherwise I really like being able to use Alexa for accessing Prime Music and Pandora and getting news and weather. I still have to work out some kinks regarding getting directions but I'm sure there's a tutorial somewhere. I've seen other reviews complaining about the long connection time but I'm not having that issue with my Galaxy S8. The best I can say is that I'd buy it again.One other note: The rubber wire guide on the vent mount came off after a couple days. I called Amazon to complain and they provided a $5 credit to make up for it. I'm very pleased with Amazon customer service.,4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I was an early adopter and got mine as soon as Amazon released them.  I checked their list of compatible autos and my 2017 Chevy Volt was not on the list.  When I got the device, the installation was easy and it seemed to connect right away  via my phone bluetooth.  It responded to my voice right away, but the response back was choppy and Alexa's voice was sometimes coherent, sometimes not.  It would play music and news fine, as long as the connection was stable.  The real problem was that when the Echo was powered on, my car would constantly drop and reconnect the bluetooth connection to my phone.  That was not a problem until I intalled the Auto Echo.  When I would disconnect the power to the Echo, the problem went away.  I have since uninstalled the Auto Echo and I do not have that problem any longer.  Bottom line, if this device would not interfere with the bluetooth connection to your car, it would work great. I'm past the return window, so Im stuck with it.",2,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"Sound quality, voice recognition, and integration is excellent. But only 2 stars because of major shortcoming. The device cannot be turned off unless unplugged or Bluetooth on phone turned off. This is not acceptable. The ability to power off device should be integrated. The vehicle unit is placed only has 12 volt always on sockets. Constantly unplugging device will prematurely wear out the USB socket. Turning off Bluetooth disables ability to use other devices in home. The Bluetooth range on this device is incredible. We have 2 story home and the device remains connected (if not unplugged). Even though we love the integration in the vehicle the simple fact the unit cannot be powered down will result in us returning the device.We spoke to Alexa device customer service. They are receiving constant complaints on this same issue. We have a return window and will give this time for a possible firmware fix. Tech said this issue has absolutely been escalated to engineers. Once fixed I have no issue changing the overall rating.

"I finally received the Echo Auto after waiting for an invite for over a year. I had been using a Muse Auto device which provided Alexa functionality in my car but didn't work very well and lacked Spotify integration. The Echo Auto is responsive even with loud music or the top down in my Miata. She performs all of the functions as my home devices. Due to limitations with bluetooth in my car, I had to use the aux cable but I found a short one on Amazon to minimize the appearance of extra cords in my car. The device starts up automatically each time I start my car without intervention.  I wish the lights were on top of the device as my device faces ""backwards"" to minimize wiring. It would also be great if it had buttons on top to skip songs (a feature I used a lot on the Muse device). I would highly recommend the echo Auto. I didn't use the vent arm due to the small vents in my car but it has a minimal appearance and should work well in most cars.I'd also love to be able to use location based routines to have certain actions triggered when I arrive / leave home.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

It's stylish, the mount is some and moves without leaving residue, then stays put again.Once I mounted it up on the dash, I no longer had to look down at it to get it to respond.

"I like being able to have Alexa in the car with me. I had the Alexa app on my phone before, but in order to use it, I would have to unlock my phone, open the app, etc. With Echo Auto, it's a completely hands free system. I have noticed sometimes that the connection gets messed up between my phone and the Echo Auto; my bluetooth is on, everything is connected, but if I give a command, the blue light comes on, but then just goes off without following the command. When that happens, I usually have to go through a process of unplugging the Echo Auto, turning off the bluetooth on my phone, then turning the bluetooth back on and plugging the Echo Auto back in. So this isn't the best thing to have happen when I'm driving. Fortunately, it doesn't happen very often.Other than that, I haven't had any issues.",4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0

If you have a terrible cell phone carrier or if you live in an area where your phone signal is glitchy, then this device may not be right for you. The only time that my Echo auto glitches is during severe storms (again, because my phone signal is poor) or when there are updates to my phone that causes me to have to resync the echo to my phone or my phone to the car.  I also used the Roav Viva before this came out and it was an awful experience. The Roav Viva would work about 50% of the time and would need to resync constantly.

"I was excited at the idea of having another Alexa device to play with, and since I got an invitation, It was a reasonable price. I have to admit that for the first time I am somewhat disappointed in an Alexa product. The device takes several minutes to connect to my car by Bluetooth (my phone is instant). When finally connected, I have to sometimes ask several times for the same command to get it to respond. It has a tendency to disconnect randomly from the Bluetooth as well. There are what I would consider, long pauses in between the music songs where it displays a (Amazon Alexa) phrase on the screen. Very strange. I'm hoping that they can do firmware or software updates to these things and fix the bugs over wifi or Bluetooth.

"How does Echo Auto work? NOT WELL! I am a big fan of Alexa in the home, but man, this tech was released well before it was ready for prime time (har har). First, the two wires that must always be plugged in to the car are messy... and then, your car audio must always be set to Bluetooth, meaning there is no seamless transition to radio or SiriusXM or any other choice... But the worst is the delay in Alexa hearing your command... where you are constantly tripping over your request and her response... You say ""Alexa,"" then must stop for a tone, then try to state your request... chances are 2 in 5 that Alexa actually ""hears you."" Such a bummer, because Alexa is the car is definitely the next logical step for voice command... but as it is now, this gizmo is frustrating and simply a FAIL more often than a success.",2,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"I have two. One for both my car and my wife's car. I love using it for listening to my local radio stations while traveling. It's great for my commute to work. I ask how my drive is going to be and it opens Google maps (S9+) and sets my destination for work. I listen to spotify and other audio apps. As far as connections, it uses your phones bluetooth to connect to the internet. Setup is very easy. My 2017 Altima uses the bluetooth for audio and my wife's 2007 Range Rover uses the aux cord. Both has great sound.  Making phone calls is much easier than using my cars built in voice recognition. Same goes for the Range Rover. Messaging is good too but it adds an audio clip as well. Sounds kind of dumb when I'm enunciating my words and my wife hears it all. My only gripe is when you lose service....it just stops. No audio at all. For us when we leave our house we have a slight deadzone until we get into town. All in all I love my echo auto.

I will give the wake-word and although the blue light comes on, nothing else happens.  While this is frustrating, it also has a ""bad habit"" of doing something else.  You can be listening to it, playing a game, etc., when it will suddenly announce ""I am having trouble connecting to the network.  Please try again later.""  Typically, it will work immediately upon requesting the action you were either in the process of, or trying to do.  Either way, it is annoying to have it suddenly stop mid-sentence.  Finally, the there are too many times your will say the wake-word, the blue light comes on, and following your request, nothing happens.With all  that said, when it does work, it is great!

I am an Alexa fanboy.  I have lots of Alexa devices and use them every day.  I was elated to be given a invitation to buy this.I had hoped this would be a fun device for the car we would use frequently.  It is not.  It is a frustrating device I likely won't use again.  Initial set up took two tries.  Since then I have had to set it up again.  Yesterday I tried to get it to connect 7 times on a short 10 mile trip while someone else drove.  It failed to connect over and over again.  It never connected and I imagine if I want to use it today I'll have to set it up again or it won't connect.  If I had to set up my home Alexa devices everyday when I wanted to use them they would already be in the trash.  Until I can set up this device once and it work at least 90% of the time when I get in the car it will remain at the bottom of my glove box unused.

There’s also no indicator of when it’s Bluetooth vs cell service problems, so if I drive through a spotty service area it’s easy to get annoyed at the device without knowing why.The lag between me saying alexa and it listening also seems slower than with regular echos.

I have both my phone and my wife's phone set up with it and it works for both.  But if both phones are present, before starting the automobile the Bluetooth needs to be turned off for the phone that you don't want to use or it confuses things.  We are using it to hands free change between streaming apps.  For example, going between iheart radio app and siriusxm app hands free.  If you use another type of echo, it is similar in the voice operation commands and usually works 75 to 80% on the first voice request.

I have alexas throughout my house so when amazon gave me the opportunity to try the echo auto before it went to the public I went for it. First of all let me tell you that if you have kids set some ground rules before hand bc if not they will every 5 seconds telling Alexa to change songs before the current song is done. Now as far as Alexa auto itself it’s ok. Half the time its not connecting even though my phone will say it is connected. She isn’t always able to understand what you’re saying  which is kind of annoying. It took a little to set up bc for whatever reason it wasn’t at first wanting to connect to my phone. I had to keep trouble shooting until if finally decided to work. Honestly if you have Siri it’s not really useful bc Siri (if you have it voice activated) does the exact same thing. The design of echo auto is cute BUT the cord is annoying. It just lays across the screen of my radio bc it’s so long. It would be nice if it somehow it was battery operated so you don’t have to deal with the cord.

I connect to the echo using the mobile hot spot on my phone and this works great until I change functions (phone call back to music) of get in and out of my car.  Echo claims it has lost connection with my phone and then tells me to go to my Alexa app to reconnect.  Since I am already connected through the app this advise is useless.  The only solution I have found is to unplug the charger, wait at least 10 seconds and then hope it reconnects when I plug the changer back in.

I hate my phone having to be connected to the car no matter what.  If it only worked through the cars WiFi it would be a great item.  Also, it took three calls and hours on the phone just to get it connected the first time and then it disconnected and had to be reconnected every time I get out of the car.

Half the things I have said she doesn’t know (unless music related). Also if streaming amazon music on Alexa at home she makes you choose to turn that one off in order to play in the car. So for the car I use pandora. I’ve noticed that if I leave my house with Alexa playing music for the dog then when I get home it’s off. This only seemed to start after adding the Alexa auto..so not sure if she interferes with the echo dot at home regardless of using pandora. I also added destinations for work into my Alexa app but when i request directions there she never understands even if I say exactly what I have labeled them as. When stating an exact address for her to give directions too she has also stated she can’t find it (even though Apple Maps and waze have no issue).My Bluetooth in my car disconnects more frequently on its own than before.,2,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0

If she was playing music, and I wanted to stop or skip the song, she would pause to listen, Then go right back to playing the song or whatever task she was previously doing, Annoying? Yes but this next big was the dealbreaker. I came out of a long day at work, ready for my 30 minute commute, listening to music or hearing my news etc, and my car battery was dead. The only difference was Alexa being plugged in all day to the USB, I had gotten comfortable leaving Alexa out and plugged in while in a secure location.

"Meh. Big fat meh. I bought this thinking it would be cool but not really knowing what to expect. I’m pretty disappointed and after the first week I didn’t even use it anymore. It needs to utilize my car speakers via aux cord since my car isn’t new enough for Bluetooth connection but it also needs you to keep your Alexa app open in order to use. I guess that’s to be expected. It’s not magic. I get it. But the biggest turn off for me was that when I said “hey Alexa get me directions to moms house” it would then need me to unlock my phone and select to open my maps app. I was hoping it wouldn’t need me to still use my “hands” to operate the phone since it defeats the purpose.Could it be cool? I guess. Would I buy it again? No. Does it do anything my phone doesn’t already do?

I love being able to drop in on my kids while I'm out on the road.  I have a 2012 Equinox without Bluetooth streaming so I installed an aftermarket device to give my Equinox that ability.  After all set up, when I jump in the car, everything connects automatically and just works.  My son and I just made a 13 hour trip to Florida and the Echo Auto worked seamless with Waze navigation while we were listening to Audible and music.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants Alexa in the car.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"Clearly the future.Got my Alexa Auto just before a 21-day, 4,400 mile road trip acros the Western US, Alberta an British Columbia.  Also bought a Pioneer 300EXL stero to add Bluetooth to my 20-year-old truck.  Have a Galaxy S8+ Android.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"I have a 2018 Honda with bluetooth. It also came with Android Auto which tries to compete with the Alexa app. It is real hit and miss if Alexa is going to work or not. We were in traffic on vacation, they closed the highway, Alexa is USELESS trying to use the road map feature. It directed us through St Louis... in the wrong direction. This unit is soo disappointing to me as I was hoping to have a true hands off experience. There are cables running all over my dash which is awful to look at. This needs a lot more work before being available to the public. When I shut off the car, on the occasion it's working, the music will continue to play on my phone and can be a real pain to get shut off. This is just a very cumbersome device. Save your money and wait a few more generations.",1,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
This is way better than a bluetooth FM transmitter. The sound quality is spot on. This is what I’ve been waiting for a very long time.Since my car doesn’t have bluetooth and I really don’t want wires this device solved all of my problems.,5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"OMG this is SO fabulous! I had absolutely NO issues. It connected to my Alexa app immediately and the bluetooth connections were instant between the echo, the phone and the car. I do need to set the audio source to Phone whenever I start the car, but that's fast as I have a touch screen. No biggie. I love being able to ask her where the nearest store or restaurant is that I'm thinking of, or what time such-and-such place closes (or opens), the weather forecast, etc. AND I can add items to my shopping list on the fly, as well as notes, reminders, etc., just like I do at home. I am LOVING this! I've used Alexa to call people on my contact list, and the sound quality was excellent, just the same as when I  use my car's bluetooth to make calls. I have NO issues with this at all!",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
I like other reviewers wanted to love this echo as we love the echo automation all over our home. Well long story short this is a complete mess. I have a pretty good working knowledge of technology so set up was not difficult. Connecting your Bluetooth on your phone to your auto and to Alexa has many conflicting faults. It will connect but the least little thing that causes the echo auto to loose connection with your phone and your done. Getting the echo auto to reconnect especially if you happen to be driving is next to impossible. When the echo auto connects to your phone it only half ( if that ) uploads your contacts from your phones contact list thus you can forget telling Alexa to call anyone let alone text. Alexa echo auto cannot multi task. By this I mean if you happen to be on the phone and pulling up to your house and ask Alexa to turn on your lights ( FORGET IT ). you can either be on a phone call or use her skills feature one thing at a time but not both at once. Many many many bugs in this echo auto and not well thought out. Shame on your research and development team for putting out such a bad quality product and soiling the echo name and reputation.. I am now going to extend my invitation to Amazon to take this product back and refund my money.,1,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"But the other 90% of the time, it doesn't work at all.This is the worst Alexa device so far. It works out of the box, but the Alexa app doesn't, so it's frustrating. It'll disconnect mid drive with no indication that you've lost connection. It will randomly disconnect and play or say random things. At one point, it was playing music through the Alexa app and through Amazon music and trying to tell me something from my pocket and something else through the speakers and Google maps was giving directions at the same time. It was the most schizophrenic robot shouting match and I couldn't control it, so I unplugged it.",1,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"Update: I've had this for a few weeks and it can be annoying at times. They took this out of the lab too quick. I have to unplug it at least once after starting my truck up and I close and reopen the Alexa app on my phone before cranking as well, that usually allows the echo to start, however when it doesn't start you sit there repeatedly saying ""Alexa"" every few minutes and have to listen to her excuses why she isn't ready. All they have to do is program the unit to make a sound or say something when it is ready for use, and fix the app/Bluetooth connection issues. Don't get me wrong, I still like it and use it every day but they could've made this a lot better with just a little more thought and effort.Sometimes it takes a little while to connect, I usually unplug it and plug it back in. Other than that, its great. I love being able to decide what song gets played next just by telling her to play a song I haven't heard in 20 years.",3,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"Not ready for consumers, and honestly has given me pause on purchasing other Amazon devices given they thought this was acceptable to release as is. If there had been ANY testing done, this would have never seen the light of day unless someone higher up decided to ignore the quality and approve it anyway.It may connect easily on initial setup, but after that you'll be screwing around with it for 30 minutes every time before you start driving either trying to get it to connect, or to stay connected. You'll get it to a point where it seems fine, and 3 minutes down the street it will start having seizures, not responding, or making awful sounds as it craps itself.",1,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"I like the idea, but there's too many glitches. Sure, maybe it's got better microphones but what good are they if in the end the commands are not executed? For example, it'd recognize the command about the news and It'll say ""here's what's new"" then...silence, then again and more silence (sometimes it just works), It'd recognize the command for playing a specific song then, just silence, until requested again. Sometimes it just fails to connect altogether, repeated instances of ""sorry...I lost connection with your device"" etc. So frustrating when you just want to hit the road and go and request songs, info etc, which is what this is supposed to facilitate. Instead you may find yourself struggling, disconnecting and reconnecting the power cable, sometimes that works, or you could try opening the app in your phone but that kind of distraction is very dangerous.In reality, perhaps this concept was DOA, the device is not really needed, you could just use your phone instead, but I thought I'd give it a try. I will reach out for support, maybe another unit will perform better, my return window has passed otherwise I'd send it back for refund.",2,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

"I purchased this while it was by invitation only. I was excited as I'd recently purchased another car for my commute that lacked bluetooth integration. Day one was simple. I plugged it in, set it up through the app and it was quite charming. Day two, it won't connect to my phone. I have to open the Alexa app to get it to connect and wait several minutes but it does finally connect. This continues for a few more days. By the second week I have to unplug alexa, toggle bluetooth on my phone and open the app repeatedly to get them to pair. The connection is consistently dropped and it takes minutes before beginning my commute to even get the thing working if I can. It's now attached to my vent and unhooked almost constantly. I've been hoping for an update so it's just waiting.",1,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0

"This product is really cool in concept... Take your Alexa device and just put it in your car. I was ecstatic to be a Beta tester for this product and I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, it fails on 2 basic user issues that have nothing to do with the efficacy of Alexa.1) It sucks your car battery like a life hog. I had 2 dead batteries the first week I used it. Both due to sitting in a parking lot waiting for my kids, but leaving the keys in the ignition. Plugging this in and unplugging it is a pain in my car, and I like to listen to music while waiting in park.",2,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

I use it on a daily basis for weather info, commute times, general random questions and, most importantly, playing music without having to touch my phone.  I also use it to control my smart home.  If I forget to turn my living room lights off in the morning, for instance, I can tell Alexa to turn them off before I pull out of my driveway.  It works exactly the same as the six Echo devices I have in my house.  I like this device so much that I started looking at upgrading my cellular plan to unlimited data and actually switched carriers to get the best unlimited deal I could.

"I was one of the lucky ones on the early list to get an echo auto when they first came out.  It has been installed in my vehicle now for quite a few months, but the truth is that most of the time I have the microphone turned off.  They either need to find a far better way of having the device integrate with your android phone, or they need to make something like the echo show for auto.  The number one thing you want to do when you're in the car, okay, maybe listen to music, but other than that, you want to navigate!  This doesn't do that.  It also does not integrate to your phone to do that.  Let's just say, I have been using this thing for several months, and I'm not impressed at all.  And this is coming from a guy that has three dots, one show, and one regular echo.",2,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I bought this through the invite only promotion and it finally arrived many months later.  I normally listen to music on my iphone through bluetooth or my ipod through usb, but they frequently lose the automatic connection.I also wanted a way to listen to amazon music. Installation requires an internet connection, which made it a little difficult for me because I dont have wi-fi or cell service in my garage.  Once installed, you need to have your phone's volume turned up all the way, silent mode turned off, and the Alexa app turned on.  Once you start your car, you need to wait a few seconds for a message to pop up asking you to push a button that says you are a passenger.  This is an obvious design flaw that makes the product nearly worthless.  I have also had problems getting it to work consistently.  Many times it has told me it has become disconnected from the app.  It also cannot play music from the music library on my iphone.",2,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I was happy to get the invite and the discount. It was a little confusing for me to hook it up, maybe I'm not so plugged in to new technology--or the instructions were (probably) lacking. Mainly I needed to go to the SOURCE on my car touchscreen, which is Bluetooth, not AM, FM, Sirius XM or other. (I suppose I thought it would auto-connect.) Eventually I connected. I really don't use it very much except for when I want to hear a particular song. Otherwise I'm usually on Sirius XM for music or comedy. I have navigation in my 2018 Ford Explorer with voice activation, not to mention my Galaxy S10+ so I haven't used it for directions yet. When my 12 year old daughter is with me I use it for jokes. I haven't asked it for trivia or general knowledge yet. I also haven't used it for other Alexa things like adding to shopping lists but it seems like regular Alexa to me. It does tend to take a little extra time to respond or even to understand me, and not necessarily due to road noise because that was not a factor the few times this happened.I use Bluetooth for my phone while driving. I just press the button on my steering wheel, the voice asks for an instruction, I tell it to call someone on my cell phone with is already wirelessly connected to the car, and I just speak to the microphone right above my head on the ceiling. The problem that I have experienced and my major negative is that several times a voice message interrupted the call I was on. Only I could hear it, not the person on the other end. I think it said something about turning down the volume but honestly I don't remember. It was definitely annoying and disruptive though. Also, whenever I make a call using Bluetooth in my car, the Echo Auto lights up. Why? With all of the stories about Alexa listening to conversations, it actually makes me a little unsure if not uncomfortable, and I am not one to feel like that. I'm no conspiracy guy. I get that it's connected to the car via USB but still, it seems strange, I don't see why a Bluetooth phone call should activate Echo Auto or that Alexa would get involved with my call. So when I'm on a call I just unplug it. Yes, because it has a cord. Also kind of annoying, because I have to plug it back in when I'm off the call.",4,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"I purchased  mine some time into the invite period. Had zero issues with connecting it to my phone and car the first time, but the connection is spotty, like maybe a third of the time it will not work due to a lost connection. Biggest issue I had was shouting commands at it over road noise. If you have a window open, forget it, she's not gonna understand you. Ironically, she often wakes up at random noise or words that are not the wake word. Needs some fine tuning. *edited to correct some embarrassing grammatical errors*",3,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
I was super excited when I first got this product.  It was really easy to setup and the quality of voice and music was what I was expecting.  My excitement slowly dwindled with each trip because it kept loosing connection to the phone and I began to loath the lack of connection tone.  I even switched from an iPhone  7 plus to an iPhone 11 pro max with no improvement. Granted cell reception is spotty in some of the areas I travel however  not being able to play through a song is frustrating.  My suggestion to Amazon is put a memory buffer (or larger buffer) to get through connection losses as well as a faster reconnect algorithm.  My music streaming from my phone directly never misses a beat and I can stream Netflix on my phone without interruptions as well.  I have several Amazon products and this is my least favorite.,2,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I really like the convenience of having Alexa so was excited to have it in my car.  I do not live in an area with very good cell service so cannot use it when driving locally and when I get to service area I haven't got it plugged in.  ☹️.  I like it on trips but most of my travels are in and out of service areas.  So when in service area I like it!  I can listen to music I want and add items to my lists!  I do have troubles at times, that it seems I need to set it up every time I start my vehicle.  But that may be due to service areas and service strength.  And I wish It didn’t have to have so many wires.  I purchased the vent clip as I didn’t want to glue the mount to my dashboard, and it doesn't fit my vent very sturdily.  But makes it simple to tuck away when I am not able to use it or don’t want it visible to all.  All in all it is a fun gadget, but I don't get to use it as much as I had hoped.",3,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0

Additionally, for those times when local stations are too weak as I travel to the fringe areas, I can simply tell Alexa to stream that local station and I get crystal clear reception!

As an add on after reading the one star reviews I had no problems setting it up and have not had to set it up again even though I have used it in 2 vehicles.  One I set up with bluetooth and one I plugged in the included wire to AUX.  I don't know why some people are having problems but it seems like a lot of the problems are maybe related to IPhones.  I'm using an Android.I wanted this primarily to read books to me as I travel in my motorhome.

This is a really great device for anyone who is a prime member and drives an older car without Bluetooth and a factory built in voice activated system. PROS  #1. It allows you to have hands free phone dialing and talking.  #2. It allows you hands free to play a huge selection of Music.  #3. It allows you ask Alexa general questions and other Alexa functions .  Cons #1.  Your PHONE ! and Phone's cell service.  #2. If you demand instant gratification. #3. It depends on cell tower connection via your PHONE not WIFI not Satellite !  People this is a $50 device for older cars or Budget models and can save you life by not having to look at your phone and hold it talking while driving. The on command Music library is the Big bonus.  It is not perfect but fine if you Keep It Simple. But its more than just plugging your phone in with an AUX cord.,4,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"I wanted to love this.. I had waited almost a year to get in on the beta and purchased it as sooner as I got my invite to. Initial setup was as straightforward as other echo devices however I've had nothing but problems since then. The device isn't always ready or connected to my car's audio system even though my phone (iphone 8) is connected via bluetooth. I've reset the bluetooth connection and still no luck. I had to force it to work using the alexa app. The voice recognition seems really poor compared to other devices and I've had a hard time making the same requests. I tried to get weather for Gatlinburg, TN while on vacation and Alexa couldn't find the location. I've asked Alexa to play certain stations and I have an active amazon music subscription and yet it's opened up stations on Pandora where I can't skip and have ads.. again frustrating. I had really high hopes for the device but it's caused more frustration because it works less than half the time and when it does work the voice recognition is poor. Amazon needs to go back to the drawing board with this device.",1,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

I have tried, with mixed results, to ask Alexa various questions while I am driving. When using it with Audible, I have to go to my phone to approve it to start at the new spot in the book if I've last listened to it in the car. That was a problem, so now I just wait until my phone and Echo sync, then start the book on my phone. That way it plays through the car speakers and sounds a lot better than when I was using the drink holders to increase the volume when playing the books straight from my phone's speaker.For me, it does what I need and when I feel like it or have more time, I'll challenge myself to see if I can get it to do more.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0

"I would give it minus one stars if I could.  It is a waste of money. I was hoping for a true Echo in my car but this is nothing more than a microphone and speaker for Alexa on my phone.

So, when I get in my car I have to be sure the Alexa app is opened and the Echo Car is connected via Bluetooth to my phone. It's a pain. And, most of the time the Echo Auto is non-responsive. I quit using it after a few drives with it. It is far from being ready for prime time. I mean I can talk to Alexa on my phone just as easily without the Auto device.  There should be a device that hooks to the network in the car and acts just like an Echo Dot when the car is on. It shouldn't need me to make sure Alexa is open on my phone and the Bluetooth is working. Ideally, new cars should have Alexa built into them.

What's the deal with that?Although not as useful as you might think on a day-to-day basis, it does work as a sort of satellite radio since you can use it to stream internet radio stations. I suppose Echo Auto is a bit of a weak spot for Amazon, since Apple has CarPlay and Android Auto is also almost a standard now. Amazon needs to find a way to have Alexa integrate with that smartphone use, but I suppose the others don't want to play along.

"I really like this echo and am glad I was chosen for the beta. It usually connects quickly and for the most part is pretty accurate in doing what I need it to do. I don't use it for directions or the like so can't comment on that aspect. But we use it for news, weather, music, games, routines, etc. There's only been a time or two when she hasn't done as asked and I had to reboot the app.It makes driving with a 2 year old much easier. Instead of digging out my phone to pull up baby shark for the millionth time I can just tell alexa to play it (again and again and again). We have routines set up for nap/bedtime so and when he falls asleep in the car it's great to be able to start them before we're in the house. This way his music is playing, the lights are off, and I can seamlessly dump him into bed.",4,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"Not exactly a turnkey solution like the other Echo devices with Alexa.  In this case, you need it monopolizing your AUX input at all times, so you cannot listen to anything else, or if you do, you need to switch to AUX to interact with Alexa.  Each time you get in the car, you need to tune to AUX, and connect your bluetooth.  It just takes too much effort, and yes, I know that makes me sound lazy, but voice assistants are good because you do not have to do anything with them after the initial setup.  I like that I can play audio over the car speakers, but sometimes I want to be able to listen to the radio and just ask Alexa a question without having to make a bunch of changes to my car's audio system.  Also, the interface is slow, and it takes longer to recognize that you are talking to it.",2,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"I had high hopes and figured it would work at least as well as the Dots and Echoes. Nope. The thing I wanted it most for was for voice-activated navigation.  But unless it's something in your phone's address book, it really doesn't work. If Alexa has to search externally for an address, most of the time it doesn't work. It either can't find the business in its search or if it does, can't figure out which location is closest...that kind of thing. As for playing music or audiobooks, it's actually easier to just do it from your phone because then you still have efficient control over forward and back, etc. I also hate that you can't change the wake word away from ""Alexa"", so you get a lot of false activations. So annoying! Overall, I'd say this is a bust.",2,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I like the idea of Alexa in the car...however, for my particular situation, I have to do a lot every time I get in my car (2013 Ford Explorer) to get it working...and 8 times out of 10 it has trouble connecting.

"I have had this for about 2 months now from the time I am writing this review. I was very excited to use this in the car because of my love for my Alexa's in the house, but this version needs a lot of work. Voice recognition works about 80% of the time. If you have your windows down or heat on full blast, forget it. Sometimes, I will tell her do something and she says she will do it, and then nothing happens. I usually have to ask her to do things at least 3 times. Sometimes she says she is not connected to the internet, even when my phone clearly is and I can get online and use spotify easily. I definitely will not be gifting this as it is poor quality and not what I expect from Amazon. Hopefully, their second and third gens are able to function and behave like an echo based in the house.",3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

"My car doesn’t have Bluetooth, so I was super excited to get this so I could listen to my Apple Music playlist through my car, plus ask the normal Alexa questions and answer calls through it, etc. upon first using it, it took forever to figure out how to get it to do a command. I would say play “shuffle Apple Music” and it wouldn’t work, so finally I tried saying it differently and it worked. It doesn’t always pick up my commands either, sometimes I have to say it two or three times. It is convenient and does let me listen to my music, but I think Alexa needs to be more adapt to different ways of saying a command and pick up my voice without me raising my voice so much. Also, it keeps cutting out while playing and I have to recommend to play my music. TBD how it works with directions, calls, etc.",2,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"So my phone must have been listening and lo and behold here’s Echo Auto! I was soooo excited when it arrived BUT don’t think you’re going to take it out of the box, pop it in the car and be on your way. Nope. Set up isn’t really complicated it just doesn’t work! After being frustrated sitting in the car I finally brought it in the house and plugged it into a charging block and sat right next to it with my phone. This worked right away! I then took it back to the car, crossed my fingers, plugged it up with the life support looking amount of cords and it worked! It seems to need to reconnect every time you get back in the car but I’ve found the best way to do this is make sure your app is closed, then turn on your Echo, then reopen your app. If you get the “I’m a passenger pop up” it will connect. I’m impressed that Alexa hears my commands even with the windows open. I absolutely LOVE being able to request/skip songs as much as I please (which is mostly what I use it for). I’ve tried asking Alexa directly for directions somewhere and it’s worked like once. I have noticed though when I pull up google maps the directions will come through Alexa in her voice (?) I really just wanted Alexa in my car to manage my music hands free and so I can obsessively ask her what time it is and for this she works!",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"I really wanted to use this. Dozens of times I had the impulse to ask something to Alexa while I was in my car and when I saw the product I thought ""I got to have this"". Setup is quite easy, indeed I set it up at home connecting it to a power bank.However, when I started using it in the car I experienced a lot fo problems. I realized that I had to use the iPhone as the audio mode to actually listen what Alexa is answering, which I hate. For example, I can listen to the radio or music from a USB and use Waze on the phone and every instruction stops the music for a while, says it on the speakers and then the music continues automatically. With Alexa it is nothing like that. I have to choose between not listening anything at all but changing the audio mode of the car to iPhone or listen something from the phone like Deezer, Spotify or something to be able to listen what Alexa has to say. Also, from time to time, Alexa stops the music, says whatever has to say and I have to press play in the car or in the phone to let the music continue.",2,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"Very difficult to set up. Once set up I could not get the device to work if I used Google Maps. It requires me to look closely at the phone screen, click the multi menu hotspot on the phone, click the Alexa app, talk and then reverse the process to continue to use maps. What good is that? This could cause an accident. I use Google Maps for many reasons and had thought by the description that it worked just by talking to it like the ones I have at home.If I have not set it up properly, I strongly urge that the company provide better setup instructions. As of now, I would not recommend buying the unit.",3,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0

"I have a rather old Toyota Camry and the connection to car audio was realized using the auxiliary cable. Overall it's a nice addition to the car because not only does it provide a hands-free link to the car audio, but also an in-car phone function that only those bluetooth-enabled newer vehicles have, i.e., you can talk on the phone while driving w/o having to hold the phone (except you'd still need to answer the phone with hand or dial a number, still a bit inconvenient I know). And if you have music saved on the phone, this device provides an excellent receiver as well so there is no more direct auxilary cable connection with the phone.The bit of downside is with Alexa. I don't keep Alexa running all the time but do often run into the issue that the app isn't started while I wake up Echo with voice. Then from time to time when a program is started Echo would stop after a few seconds for no reason, until it is commanded the second time.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I was very disappointed with this product. I expected more from this Amazon product than what I previously had with the Roav adapter. I can use my iPhone and Alexa app to stream music and get directions via Bluetooth in my Jeep so this product provides no advantage. Furthermore the volume must be turned so loud that it causes your car speakers to be distorted. As a prime member I feel privileged to get access to products in advance but not if we’re merely used to beta test products. In my humble opinion this product should not have been released without having been tested more thoroughly and some of these issues addressed. Another feature where the Roav is superior is the plug-in adapter. The one provided with Echo Auto forces the cord to be plugged in from the front causing it to be in the way, while the USB ports for the Roav are facing downward so the cords are less bothersome. I’m really disappointed that Amazon released this product with so many major issues.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0

"Works nicely for the car.  It does exclusively rely on your phone. I knew that it needed data, but if you are sitting in carline, listening to music on the echo, and an ad pops up, your music will stop. Anything that would play sound over Bluetooth will also mess up the echo. When you think about it, it makes sense, but I just didn’t expect it. I figured that the phone and the echo would be much more independent.I am also disappointed by how often you have to disconnect the power to get it to work properly. It seems to happen about every other day (on average). Some days it will not work more often than it works.",3,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"The one quibble I have with the Echo Auto is fairly minor.  Transcribed voice to text on my phone turns into complete nonsense.  When driving, this is the only way I can safely input text into my phone, so you can see how that would be problematic.  I've got an iPhone, and if I'm just using Siri, the text is roughly 95% accurate; there's one wrong word every once in a while.  But with Echo Auto, it's more like 30-40%, and that's negative value, because correcting typos while driving is suicide.That aside, everything else is amazing.  Installation is a breeze.  It's synced to both my iPhone and my wife's Pixel, and works flawlessly.  The ability to access my Amazon Unlimited catalog 10 seconds after I've entered the car is dreamy.  And beyond the unfortunate speech-to-text functionality, it's excellent with hands-free calling.",4,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
Hmmmm seems no stars is not an option.  First off let me start by saying my dad was begging for this for his birthday.  Since he’s normally difficult to shop for I was excited to give this to him.From the get go there were issues.  After 20 minutes of futilely trying to set it up he asked me to give it a go.  It took me another 15 minutes to get her to connect and integrate with cars Bluetooth and the Alexa app on his phone.  While she claimed to be connected she couldn’t complete any tasks and always followed with some apology.

Updated !I received this Alexa Auto through the invitation.  I was so excited to receive it.  It worked so wonderfully.  After Applr updated the IOS 13.1.2 for some reason Alexa isn't recognizing my phone. ☹️.  I went through the steps to reconnect and not even the Alexa app won't recognize the Alexa Auto as an added Alexa.  It works and then when I turn my car off and go back in I lose it.

"Wasn’t really sure if this would work in my car but gave it a shot. I have an older car with a newer Bluetooth stereo. It does work sometimes, not always, but like other reviews said, when it does work, it takes a while to power on. Sometimes it says it is having trouble connecting with the app, but I never do anything differently so I’ve yet to figure out why it works on some drives and not on others.The vent clip is kinda dumb, the rubber part that holds the cord broke off from the plastic part within a couple days.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Got this for free from my insurance company - thank you! I didn’t set up Bluetooth because my car is too old, but set up was simple, and it worked well out of the box. It does take a moment, usually about 20 seconds after starting, before it hooks into the phone and works. Sounds quality is remarkably good, much better than the Bluetooth receivers I had been using. It does use data, but not a huge amount. Right now, after two weeks of streaming on a few long trips, it seems to have used about 1.5 gigs. I don’t know that I would’ve bought it, but I am glad to have it. Alexa is good for making calls and doing other Alexa things. I like Siri as well, but I’d hate to see the price tag if Apple gets into this game. If you don’t already have a device like this, I highly recommend.",4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I want to like this, I really do, but it has quite a few bugs to work out.For example, my biggest issue is that the Echo will continue to do whatever it was doing once the car is shut off and bluetooth connection is cut.  For example, when listening to Audible - if I shut the car off without turning off the Alexa app, the Audible will continue to play (somewhere) and when I come back to it, the book will have advanced to however long I was gone.",2,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"If you want to infuriate yourself every morning on the way to work, this is the product for you.  I usually make it about 10-15 minutes before I find myself yelling ""Alexa stop!  Alexa!  Alexa!!!""  It will usually start off ok, but by the third or fourth command it will start ignoring every other command.  Sometimes it will acknowledge the command and say it is going to do something, like play a song, and then never do it.  Then it will start ignoring commands altogether and just continue doing whatever it was doing forever.  The only way to break out of this is to restart the Alexa app on the phone, which is obviously not safe while driving.  It's also very slow.  If you're scrolling through a playlist and have to say: Alexa - pause - Next - long pause - song starts eventually, it's all much slower than simply clicking next a few times at the next stoplight, which I'm back to doing a lot of and was the whole reason I bought this.  I guess I'll keep trying and maybe a software update will improve it, since it seems to be app integration issues more than the physical product itself.  But I would not buy it again.",1,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I never would have considered echo auto except my insurance company had a deal through Amazon and there was no cost to me. I found it difficult to set up.  I am still not sure I did it, although Alexa talked to me letting me know my phone wasn't near. It will answer questions like my dot BUT it will use up data.  How much, I don't know.  There is no information on whether it is always using data, uses data when you ask something or uses data for music. Apparently it will read messages.  But I don't necessarily want messages read.Maybe I am just too old for this.  If it wasn't free, I would have returned it.  I like Alexa, just not this particular hard to figure out gadget.  Definitely not something for those of us not using or paying for unlimited data.",2,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0

You speak, she'll light up, and then never awnser. Once in a while she'll say she can't connect but most of the time it's just silence. Eventually she'll start ignoring you entirely even when you get a strong connection back. They need to fix this for the product to ever be viable. I know Amazon can't do much about your internet connection but there's got to be a better way for it to respond than just timing out.It also has a hard time hearing you over music, I think it's a little bit worse than the regular Echo.",2,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0

I love what the devices enable me to do with routines, voice commands, recipes, setting my thermostat, and the list keeps growing. I was so excited when I received an early Echo auto before it was available for retail.

"So I got this for 25 dollars because I was invited to buy this at a cheaper price, now I will be honest, setting it up is really a hassle, I had to call Amazon customer service while in my car to try and set this up. I had to set it up through my aux cord because I don't have Bluetooth in my car so that was a struggle in itself. I also found myself not using the part that attaches to your ac. the holder, because I found for it to be too many wires in my drivers read and intertwining with the PRNDL and it was gonna be a safety issue. Also you have to open the Alexa app every single time you need to interact with the echo auto every time you turn the car on, which can again, be annoying after sometime, but once you get the hang of it, its actually really nice to have a fun little copilot giving you directions and listening to music and Alexa matches. my energy of when I need to change a song right in the middle of it and does it no problem, overall I'm glad I bought it and I cant wait to see what new echo items are coming along, to quote one of my favorite Simpsons quotes ""and I for one welcome our new robot overlords.""",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"My car is loud as it is old. Siri can’t hear me at all, my aux bluetooth sucked, and I’ve gone through three Belkin aux lightning charger adaptors. The echo auto works surprisingly well and leaves my iPhone XS Max lightning port available for charging. If I speak clearly, at a volume I would for someone else in the car to hear me over the noise from the hole in my exhaust, Alexa responds instantly. I mostly use the echo auto to control Spotify. When I approach my car the echo connects automatically and when I start up the engine my phone recognizes it’s in car mode and apps like Spotify alter their interfaces, google maps marks parked car location, etc. The vent mount doesn’t work on the 2006 Saturn Ion but the echo auto rests in a little divot above the clock. Occasionally the echo auto struggles to connect, but cycling the Bluetooth on my phone on and off fixes it instantly. Using echo auto to control maps is also a bit challenging, but I usually enter my destination before I leave anyways. It’s a new product, relies on other vendors’ phones for visual and app interface, and has to adapt to a ton of different background noise environments. 4/5 for sure.

"First, the frustration with many on the reviews is that it won't connect or they spend more time trying to get it to work than they should. My problem was that it wouldn't work or connect after the initial set up. A problem that could have easily been remedied with a few more instructions on the enclosed brochure. What it doesn't tell you is that you have to keep the Alexa app open the entire time you're using the Echo Auto. When I say ""open"" I mean that the app is opened, not that you have it pulled up and on your phone screen. It'll work as long as you don't swipe the app closed so it can run in the background.The Echo Auto works great for what it is. My car doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities but it does have an auxiliary input. It connects my phone through Bluetooth so I don't have to have all the wires connecting to my phone.

"Echo auto is a great idea for older cars that do not have blue tooth / handsfree controls. Or even for newer cars that just don't have a serviceable voice interface. However there is quite a difference between a great idea and one that actual works! Take voice activation..there are two main problems...1. the echo has a hard time hearing speech when something is playing, even at low volumes. 2. the echo has a hard time hearing you during the first 5 to 10 minutes you are in the car, even when nothing is playing. In the same vein the echo appears to hear the ""wake"" word but just doesn't execute the command. Sometimes when you start the car and give a command the echo states that it is not connected to the network, though I think this is just until you get a distant away from your wifi. That kind of makes sense. All in all it's okay for cars that have no voice control available because some is better than none.

I can add items to the grocery list when I think of it, add to my to do list without having to wait until I get home (which I usually forget by the time I get home), and I can access my Alexa apps. No need to wait to find info anymore. The gizmo they give to hook Alexa to the air vents is great!  It's a nice design, at least for my car.",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"After waiting months to receive an “invitation” to buy the Echo Auto U was quite disappointed in it. After installing it in the car I chatted with Customer Service and talked with someone on the phone because the vent mount included does not provide a very secure attachment to the vehicle. The instructions mentioned a dashboard mount, implying that there is one. According to Customer Service there was a dashboard mount used in the development (testing process?) but a decision was made not to have one. (I thought about trying to improvise something with Velcro but the instructions indicate not to use anything that isn’t made to use with it.) I was concerned that the Echo would fall off the mount and the whole contraption did indeed fall off. I think it’s reasonable to expect that the product could be safely and securely installed in most vehicles but that is not the case. It just isn’t going to work for me in the current incarnation but I have no doubt that Amazon can come up with a better way of attaching it more securely.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I bought one of these through the invitation-only program. I am not impressed. The Echo continually loses the Bluetooth connection, doesn't respond well to voice commands, and is generally more of an exercise in frustration than anything else. I have satellite radio in my Jeep, so Echo was never going to be my go-to music choice while driving, but I'd hoped it would be an upgrade over my iPhone for maps and directions. But no joy there, not with it constantly losing the connection to said iPhone. Until Amazon seriously upgrades and improves this Echo don't waste your money. It's a real shame, too. (I, by the way, have an Echo Show in my kitchen, an original Echo in my living room, and three Echo dots scattered around the house, so I'm obviously an Echo fan)",1,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"Once I had the Alexa app updated on my Samsung S8 Active, it connected. Before the update, Alexa Auto doesn't show up or connect through 'other devices'. Once you go through the setup and watch a short video, you're done.A side note: Yes, you really don't need this to run Alexa, but you will have to look/touch your phone to activate her. With Auto, you just talk. Do you walk around your house touching your phone to activate Alexa to turn off/on lights, etc? I can have one hand on the wheel and the other holding my wife's hand while saying ""Alexa, play Your My Home by Billy Joel"". That makes it sooo worth it!",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I excitedly waited to add this device to my Alexa family. Until its arrival I would use the Amazon Music App to play music through my bluetooth  in my car. I was extremely happy listening to music that way but the promises presented by the Echo Auto made me think that once connected, I would not have to fuss with the phone anymore or at least not as much. Not so.In order to use the Echo Auto I still have to open the Alexa App and assure it that I can drive & listen to music. If I ask it to play music by any particular artist it might play one or two and then go silent. It is irritatingly GLITCHY. I will keep it in the eternal hope that there will be software improvements, but honestly, I was better off using my phone with the Amazon music app. Sorry Alexa.",3,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I have numerous Amazon Echo devices around the house and find it very convenient to have the Echo Auto in the car when I need to drop into the house. It's easy to set up and to integrate into my existing Alexa profile. I didn't use the vent mount because I didn't want to block air flow, although the vent mount was very nicely constructed. Instead, I used some sticky mount and mounted it to my center console.I like how there are still the mute and action buttons. It's nice to use them when it gets noisy in the car. While the Echo is supposed to easily pick up voices around the car cabin, it doesn't always get triggered when it gets noisy. We still have to speak up more than our normal voice to trigger it.  When it's quiet, it's great in picking up the trigger word without a problem.  We do wish that the Echo Auto allows me to change the trigger word like the other Echo devices. I prefer to use ""Echo"" instead of Alexa. I hope they add that functionality later.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"The echo auto is very cool, and I'm in no way sorry I purchased it. However, it needs some work imho. My primary complaint is that Alexa in general needs more development in regards to her indexing talents. It's irritating to say something like ""Shuffle NF from my library"" just to have her tell you she can't find any songs by ""En Eff.""That said, the echo auto works better than my Ford Sync system ever did. It's faster, with another voice recognition and call function. I do wish it was just built into my car, as ambient noises stick as the air conditioner on high, or the window defrost/defog can really screw her up. Again, though, to be fair, for what it is, which is a small microphone platform, the echo auto is really pretty fantastic.",4,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"Adding Alexa to my car is so fantastic. For starters, my car doesn't have builtin bluetooth and I have to connect everything via the auxiliary input.  It's a massive upgrade to get into my car, turn it on and say ""Alexa play my soundtrack"" and music starts playing. I don't have to plugin anything or open my phone and find a playlist or anything. Start car, say what I need and I'm done. Obviously while driving it's just as fantastic to switch songs or playlists or whatever without having to look at my phone or mess with anything. Having the ability to control my smart devices is also a nice addition. I can turn on some lights in the house as I'm pulling into the garage or whatever else.As for setup, I was done in a couple of minutes. I followed the directions that came with the device and was good to go with no hiccups or confusion. The only thing I dislike is that I can't rename the device name in the Alexa app. All the other echo's in the house are named by their location so having a ""Echo72826"" isn't great. It'd be nice to name it after whatever car it's in.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"Great idea. So great it has me saying “Alexa, volume down” in my mom’s car, which doesn’t have echo auto.  Haha. I’m serious, you’ll wonder how you used to survive without Alexa in your car.  Some weird issues:  somehow ever since adding this to my Alexa family (which is rather large, I admit, with 8 echo devices and 3 Alexa enabled fire tablets, managing a horde of smart plugs, smart switches, smart tv, oh yeah I forgot my fire tv cube! Etc), Spotify seems to think I have two iPhones that are identical (maybe because echo auto works through the phone?) and has been having major issues playing from the correct device.  Sometimes playing from my home when I am trying to play from my office and vice versa.  All this started the day i added echo auto.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
Update: this thing is absolutely worthless. I removed my Garmin Speak and replaced it with Echo auto. The constant Bluetooth interference and disconnects made me switch back to my Speak. So glad I switched back. I want to smash it now. Worthless. Save your moneyI’m in the car a lot so I have gotten to use this Alexa for several days now. It’s awesome.

"A big waste of money. Uses phone as speaker and cannot get it to work via radio speakers in my 2011 Prius with Bluetooth. No way as useful as other echos.Revised 13Nov2019: was 2 strs, revised to 4 stars:",4,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"Not sure of what the actual issue is but it appears that the auto version continually runs in the background of my cell phone. This ties up the operating system. During phone conversation you are unable to communicate with the person you are speaking to as Alexa is doing something else in the background. After a few annoying moments the call is restored but this happens repeatedly. This version also has other limitations that my Echo Show does not. You are unable to connect to radio stations and Alexa simply say "" I don't know what went wrong"". After several attempts and some research I have found that the mobile version does not support popular apps like link in and I heart radio. These annoying problems make the unit cumbersome and I will not use it very often or at all until corrected.",3,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"When I first set it up, it required the Alexa app to be running before you can ask anything. That was annoying and defeated the purpose of going hands free. They have since corrected that and are no longer required to bring up the app. Good job! The biggest fault I have seen is it regularly drops bluetooth sync with my iPhone 8; music might start coming out of the Echo instead vice the car radio, and it regularly stops playing after one song in a series. Very frustrating to ask, ""Play 80s Rock,"" and get only one song. Also believe integration with WAZE is not figured out yet since running the WAZE app causes the audio to drop from the Echo. Cycling through the apps on my iPhone is the only way to get audio fed back through the bluetooth. I love all things about Amazon and their Echos. I'm hoping with firmware and software updates, this too will be any amazing device to use on the road.",3,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

"So far, I am not thrilled with the Echo Auto. I seem to spend a lot of time with the help desk with issues. I sent one back and they sent me a new one but we still had connection issues that needed the help desk to walk me through with. First it was setting up the Echo and then once it was setup we continued to struggle for it to work. It would make the initial connection when I opened the app and asked Alexa a question, but any subsequent inquiries the blue light just keeps flashing, with no response. It has been more frustrating than anything. Maybe these are Apple issues as they did state that they do not have ""license"" rights to a few of the Apple services, like mapping. This is a first gen product, so hopefully it will get better, but honestly, I am not sure it is necessary with all our phones and cars can do these days. My husband is going to try it in his vehicle on his Android to see if he has a better response.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Finally get to write my review. I got my Echo Auto several months ago and I've been enjoying it ever since. The cords are too short and the plugs should be at the back or angled so they're not sticking out of the side, but I found a way to hide it.Functions are great. I can drop in and ask for music which is great. I can run routines which is really useful. As for navigation and other personal assistant stuff, not so good. It has a tough time sending SMS or even navigating. But, a side effect of the unit is that it improves Google Assistant response as well. So I've got both Google and Alexa thanks to this unit.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I got the echo auto for my partner - he has many Alexa devices, but his car doesn't have Bluetooth, so I thought this would be perfect for him! Set up was easy, if you have experience setting up smart home devices. We like that it gives us access to Alexa while in the car - so we can ask it to do things at home, like turn on our driveway lights, or listen to music through the car speakers. Sound quality is always excellent. Some issues: we live in a pretty rural county, so we go through patches when we're driving where Alexa loses internet connection and the music cuts out. We also had to fiddle a little to find the best place in the car for the device so that it can hear all passengers. Other than that though, great little device, and very reasonably priced!",4,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
cons:1. There are no good mounting options. It 's only a vent mount. your basic velcro is thick and the adhesive is poor and turns to syrup in a hot car. There is no clean mounting installation of this thing.,2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this device.  Amazon missed the mark on this one.I found it to be very clitchy. Connection to your phone was hit and miss. To distracting while driving.

"This device worked as intended for me, and the voice recognition and quick response are pretty impressive. However, I could achieve most/all of this functionality with my iPhone, so half the fun of this is the cool parlor trick of having an Alexa device in your car ... but the decidedly uncool power cord protrudes from the right side so that it's hard to place the device in a way that doesn't look horsey, with a cord draped across your dashboard and the sole method of mounting being a ginormous bracket that blocks off an AC vent.The flaws for me were cosmetic but obvious. I bet Gen2 is much better. I'd recommend more bracket options and less obtrusive power port(s), maybe off the back. And make it smaller. Or a puck-style device that fits in a cup holder ...",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I was so excited when I got invited to purchase the echo auto for half price and so excited to try it out. But it failed me already during the setup process.

My car has car play so I connected it with Bluetooth with my phone.The listening and response is great. It can hear my command. The echo auto is very not useful when it comes to calling. I use Chinese characters for my contacts, so I have to add in the English name before the characters in order for echo to pick it up from commands. And it does not work all the time.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
this works pretty well some minor glitches here and there with it not wanting to connect to the phone. That's doesn't happen often. Make sure you turn Bluetooth on your phone and you open the Alexa app for it to work properly.with all the microphones in it it listens to you better than the ones that are in your house where you have to constantly yell at them. I have an older louder car. And it works pretty well on a factory system with a Bluetooth adapter and my cigarette lighter. That model adapter I used was bt36. There are two plugs on it one that has like a music note on it and one that's like 3.1 amps. Make sure you put it in the 3.1 amps one putting it into the music one the low amperage does not allow it to work properly. and it may be the same way for a lot of the adapters out there. But it works pretty well. just remember you do need to have internet on your phone or tablet or whatever device you're using to use the product because that's how it works.,5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,1
Seems to continually require me to reconnect via Alexa on my phone every time I get in my vehicle. Supports bluetooth but you'll have to use a cable connection else the radio won't default back to Echo every time I start the vehicle. I can play my Amazon playlist (eat bandwidth) but it won't support my Amazon offline music like CarPlay. Alexa can tell me directions but cannot show it on a map like CarPlay. I can tell Siri to adjust my a/c temp but Alexa doesn't understand. The pros of Echo would be very good mics and the ability to ask Alexa anything versus Siri. But that's a short list compared to the other features CarPlay can provide. Maybe Echo would be good for an older car that doesn't support CarPlay but it's a disappointment in my 2019 Jeep.,1,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0

"I really should set the record straight about this item. It's not ""truly"" an Alexa per say. It's an augmented microphone relay that my phone's Alexa answers and plays music through. Hence, it's something of a sham. Sure, it talks during the setup but, once it's hooked in, it does all the relay through the phone (at least mine does) and who wants a ""phone"" speaker taking the place of an Alexa.Now, if you were to hook it in through an Android stereo, the case might be different as that would be amplified sound and the experience would be better. The only true difference between having the Alexa app (on the phone) and this item is: It listens (constantly) for the ""Alexa"" word.",3,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"Limited in what it does, it can be a mildly handy little tool. It's helped me avoid checking text messages while driving, and using my phone for all sorts of things while it's in my pocket.  But it doesn't limit cords in my car, as it needs two cables plugged in.  For many cars that have bluetooth, that is only one cord needed, but then most of the functions of this are built into your car already.  I like it, and it does what it says, but I'm not sure who it's for.  I don't feel like it solved any problem for me that could not have been solved by other products already on the market, some of which might do it in a better way.I think if it had been marketed as Alexa for auto, and focused on how it adds alexa functions to your car, it might have been better understood by its customers.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
I received my Amazon Auto as a free gift from Nationwide insurance yesterday.

Often when I ask Alexa for the weather report, it tells me it can't find my location. Even when it asks me for the local and I give it my city and state, it says it doesn't know my location or recognize it.

It probably works best for folks who live in the city, but I live in a rural area and don't always have the best service. That's why I download media. I got this device to make allow hands free use while driving, but if you're offline, you need to use your to complete these tasks, which defeats the purpose (it's also frustrating when you're offline).

"Gonna be honest. Your iPhone and Siri can do a much better job than this device (Hey Google for Android, and Cortana for MS phones).  Having that said- you can stop reading- all that follows are my reasons to back up my statement.  Here's my official review.  I own A LOT of Alexa devices.  I have the Original Echo 1st Gen (That I still use) a few Dots (1st Gen) and several Dots (2nd Gen)  I have a Show (2nd Gen) and a Show 5.  So i'm a fanboy of Alexa.  I was REALLY looking forward to this device.  I will hand it to Amazon for how they marketed this.  They created such a pseudo-demand for it by ""selecting"" a number of invitees to purchase before the main release.  I was one of the unfortunate ones- so I had to wait.  It finally dropped- I bought it.  Installed it.  And was disappointed.  First off.  Aesthetics.  While the device itself looks very nice and cool.  The cords are a nuisance and a serious eyesore.  There is almost no clean way to install this.  I'm a geek.  I have an Acura with a Tech package.  Everything looks sleek and clean.  I even have a dash Cam that looks virtually invisible.  This thing- my god.  It's just a plain eyesore. Ask it to navigate to somewhere- it's horrible.  I got this to be more ""Hand free"".  This thing tells me to unlock my phone, go to the Alexa app, and then go from there.  I can just ask Siri to navigate to the nearest Dunkin Doughnuts and siri does it with almost a Ninja like reflex.  So I won't be using this for navigation.  SO then, I thought- Maybe with the Mic array I would get clearer hands free call.  Nope.  Doesn't even use them.  It uses the vehicle's mic.  Save your money....Just use Siri or Google (Or Cortana)  The only thing this thing does WELL is play my Amazon music.

The voice recognition is downright unusable at times (and not because of ambient noise.). The integration with your Alexa app is very glitchy.  First of all, you have to ""train"" yourself to turn on your Alexa app every time you get in your car.  And, you'll need to ""train"" yourself to not get annoyed every other time when you're not driving and you use your Alexa app and have to attest that ""I am a passenger"" before checking your grocery list!  While driving is worst place to be frustrated - very distracting and very dangerous.  So, I've been forced to not use my voice activated assistant which defeats the whole reason for having it in the first place!",3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I waited in great anticipation for the release of Amazon’s Echo Auto. The ability to use Alexa in the car and execute tasks hands-free while driving was more than worth the price. I enjoy using Echo Auto, especially to play music in the car or ask for weather reports, but it’s not without issues. My main complaint is with the driving directions. Rather than giving you turn-by-turn voice directions, it simply opens a map on your phone. You still have to use Google Maos or some other service for GPS. The other problem I’ve experienced is difficulty getting the Echo Auto to connect in the car and stay connected. Some days it works, other days it won’t connect. Overall, Echo Auto is a promising new product that does bring some added convenience and enjoyment to driving. This is Version 1, and it’s still a work in progress. I’m sure future versions will be better.",3,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
I was looking SO forward to the Echo Auto when I requested it over a year ago.  I was even MORE excited when I was selected last month to finally purchase one!  Sigh that's where it ends.Fairly easy to set up.  Device showed up in list quickly but I received a call during the installation (after I tapped on the device in the list to continue setup) which I think confused it because I had to try several times after finishing the call to actually complete the setup.,1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"We just picked one up at BestBuy today. Same price on Amazon. We have our entire home set up with Alexa’s pretty much in every major room in our home linked to Philip Hue Lights and Arlo cameras. So I decided to give it a try.Set up was easy as pie. I had it set up and connected in my Range Rover while we were still in the parking lot. We were off and on our way home in less than 10 minutes (including unboxing). Started trying out several things right away. Checked the weather, nearest gas station, news, and then music. As we arrived home, I shut off our security cameras and turned on our living room lights. We didn’t have a single issue with anything. Worked as expected.",4,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"After waiting almost a year to get my Echo Auto, it is finally here!  There are a lot of rough reviews out there, but I'm not sure what everyone was expecting.  As an Alexa device for your car, it works exactly as expected.  Sound quality is great, it hears my voice with no issues, and responds exactly like my Echo devices at home.  It is limited by your phone's wireless connectivity, and I'd probably like it to buffer music longer.  That being said, Amazon Music allows you to download songs, so I'm pretty sure I can work around that for songs I know I want to listen to.  Install was easy, and fortunately I found a nice spot to run the cable out of sight.  My Echo Auto came with the vent mount only; it looks like there were problems with the sticky mount and they stopped including it (good choice).  Echo Auto isn't always going to be perfect for your application, but I'm really impressed with what Amazon was able to provide at this price point.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,1
"It’s great for getting music from Amazon music without having to find it in your phone. However, I mostly listen to audible in the car and I found that it did not keep the place Of my book from the car to my phone. So I stopped using it and gave it to my husband.The other thing that bothered me was the delay between asking ‘Alexa’ and the time you could talk. I don’t believe that’s an Alexa problem but just jot Bluetooth works. Either way it made it less desirable .",3,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"If you are like me your heart sank when either got your Echo Auto, or read the description, and saw it required your car to either have its own built-in Bluetooth or that your radio have an auxiliary jack. The good news is with a good Bluetooth Car Phone  Speaker, like  the VeoPulse B-PRO 2B, it will work just fine. I am not vouching for other brands or models of Car Phone Speaker, just the VeoPulse B-PRO 2B.If you are thinking, ""well of course,"" then I ask you to please keep in my that the literally minded people like me, who drives a 2002 Toyota with neither built in Bluetooth or an auxiliary jack.

"My one major complaint is that it will not override my stereo when I ask it a question, like my cellphone will when a call comes in.  If I am listening to my radio and a cellphone call comes in it automatically switches to Bluetooth and when the call is complete it will switch back to the radio.  I do not have to mess with any controls and can just watch the road.  I want auto alexa to do that.  Now I have manually switch to Bluetooth and then I can ask alexa a question then switch back to radio.  This may require me to look away from the road or pull to the side of the road, which is not ideal.  Another newer trick is you have restart the app and acknowledge you are a passenger, which is about dumbest thing any one thought of.  The purpose of this is to be hands free.  Does Amazon really want to be responsible for people fiddling with the phone while driving.",3,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
I have a 2007 car that won’t connect to my phone other than for phone calls.  I previously bought a taotronics Bluetooth receiver to allow me to play music/podcasts wirelessly but I still had to turn the taotronics everytime I got in my car (among other annoyances).Echo auto makes my car fully Bluetooth and adds always-on Alexa.  HUGE BONUS - I can still use Siri instead of Alexa to play podcasts through Apple podcast app and it plays through the Bluetooth!  I didn’t figure that out for a while - I thought you had to start everything using Alexa for it to play through the Echo Auto.,4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Generally, it feels like Amazon released a half-baked product to test the market. I know it's common practice, but I did expect an Amazon product to come out in better shape than this.

"I was lucky enough to be a beta tester for this product so I have seen continuous improvements.  All in all, I am VERY pleased with this product.  It works ALMOST as well as an Echo Dot but sometimes it struggles with connecting to the phone app and sometimes it just refuses to do what you ask.  I have 2 of them and they both work the same.  Usually a quick reset of power and it starts working properly again.  They still have some bugs to work out but I rarely use my radio stations anymore, as you can say ""play whatever station you want"" and almost any station will play through Tune-in or iHeartRadio.  It is automatic so you just say what station you want and it figures out how to find it.  It also has all of the features of the Echo Dot.",4,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"First things first; if you have an iPhone, this isn't the device for you.

You also have to have the app open on your phone in order for it to sync. When she is connected, she works really well. I'm just disappointed at how long it takes for her to connect in the car and the problems I've had getting her to connect at times. I've even had to close my app and reopen for her to connect at times. I've also had to delete the device altogether and reinstall. I'm sure as time goes on, it will get better.

"*Updated*After months of it being in my car, my car was broken in to even though this was well hidden.  Why would they break into a car without being able to see anything?

So... now my Echo auto device has cost me an additional $500 in glass repairs... yay.",1,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
I love it when it works. However it disconnects frequently from the car Bluetooth. It is annoying when it stops functioning because it is describing an app and then it hears itself say “Alexa” and then stops doing what it is doing. It really needs to be able to change the wake work.I do not like that I can’t give authorization to make purchases and for some functions it will tell me to go to the app to do something. I don’t have access to the app while driving so that is annoying.,2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
I was so excited when Amazon announced this thing for your car but it's basically worthless if you already have Android Auto and Car Play in your car.  My car's Android Auto does more than the Echo Auto.  I say Hey Google play a song on Spotify and it does.  I ask Alexa and it can't find the song or wants to play in on Amazon Music.  Get driving directions to a store and it comes right up on my AA dashboard.  I ask Alexa and it comes up on my phone but not on Waze and my phone is put away in the cupholder.  How can I read directions on my phone when it's not in front of me.It was a really nice attempt by Amazon to try and put Alexa in the car but there is just a place where Alexa is not needed and it's in the car.,1,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"if I had a new car, I would love this Echo Auto and use it all the time.  It connected pretty easily, and worked great when I tested it.  But because I have an older car, and have to connect it to the auxiliary Line In on my car stereo, I just won't use it very often.  I had anticipated being able to use it often, especially for reminders etc as I was driving, but it's just not worth the effort to plug everything in for a 15 minute drive to and from work.  And I hadn't really thought it through so didn't realize until I tested it that I wouldn't be able to just talk over the radio etc to use it.  I have to switch to Line In to speak or listen, so it's just not that convenient.  I am keeping it, hopefully I'll get a newer car soon and can utilize it more.",4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"The idea is good. Execution, no so much. It is VERY glitchy. If you just use it for music it's not too bad. But for anything else it gets more annoying than anything. My daughter likes to play 20 questions with Alexa while we are in the car, good idea, keeps her occupied, BUT it gets stuck in game mode. To get it back to where you can play music you have to unplug it and the plug it back in and reconnect. Total pain! Each time you get in the car, it has to reconnect with your phone. Sometimes it happens quick, 90% of the time it has issues and you don't have time to mess with trying to get it reconnected while you are driving. And all the cords associated with it are a terrible eye sore right on the dash of your car. Needs a lot more thought put into it. This seems more like the makers were like 'hey let's make Alexa for the car' and 1 day later they did. Seems like little to no thought or effort was put into this. Hopefully it will get better over time. Glad I got this free through my insurance. If I would have paid for this I would have returned it.",1,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"After using the Echo Auto for a couple of weeks, I am struggling with whether or not I am going to continue to use the device.  I honestly don't know if it adds incremental value.  Do I really need to ask Alexa to play music from Spotify or Pandora for me when I can simply set it up before I hit the road?  I still need to go through the process of changing my radio setting to select bluetooth as the preferred source so i am not really saving any time.  is it worth the price of the Echo Auto for the novelty of being able to ask Alexa to play my music rather than doing it myself?  I am just not sure.  Beyond that, I am frustrated by the way I interact with Alexa through the Echo Auto.  I am accustomed to calling to Alexa and asking a question or making a request immediately.  With the Echo Auto, I need to wait for the device to respond to the callout to Alexa before i can make my request.  it is not a long delay - maybe 1-2 seconds - but it is not how I have been interacting with Alexa-enabed devices for the past few years.  I am still willing to give the Echo Auto a chance and I will continue to use it while i am on the road for longer distances as I may chance my tune but, right now, I am on the fence.",3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
Apparently there have been a lot of negative reviews of this product. And while everybody is entitled to their own opinion I just don't get it because this thing is freaking awesome!Yes it's a little sluggish when you first get in your car. It has to pair with your smart phone and it's the same for any blue tooth device I've ever used.

Great addition to a car without Bluetooth without spending a ton! Easy to use and set up for sure! I bought two and put one in my truck and car. I do like that it pairs with my current Bluetooth in my truck. The two complaints I have is the calling quality. Everyone I've talked to when using the Bluetooth has complained about the sound and I usually have to disconnect it. The second issue is the voice recognition. Love the speech to text when sending a message but I usually have to repeat myself 3 or 4 times. Also when asking Alexa to play my play lists seem to be a struggle. I don't like that it goes to Pandora. I'll ask to play my play list from Amazon music and it plays some channel off Pandora and I don't use Pandora. Overall I'm happy and the features are cool!,4,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"I've been happy with my Alexa dots ever since I got them for my home. So when I signed up to test out the Alexa auto I was excited. And even more excited when I was picked to purchase it at a lower cost to test it out. It has been nice to have it in my car. I can play the amazon music that I play in my home. I can add something to my calendar and more. I only have one issue with the gps - it will only gps to your phone and not the car. I have a gps in my car and I use that screen when I need to use the gps. I don't see the point in using my small phone screen to gps when I have the nice big screen in my car.

I usually end up having to put the phone on speaker.  I bought this hoping it would work as a hands-free option for my older vehicle which does not have blue tooth.  There are many times I say Alexa and get no response. Then I turn it off and turn it back on and still no response.  Other times, it works perfectly.

"EDIT: I hate to say this because I loved this product when my husband first installed it in the car, but it stopped working within three months. No joke, it just stopped working. Note, I used to remove it after I turned off my car so that someone wouldn't get any ideas and try to break into my car and rip it off. I live in a not-so-nice apartment complex, so leaving it in there was not an option. That said, this Echo product shouldn't have just died like that so quickly, especially considering the coldest it ever got was about 60 F degrees in the car. So sad though.

I want to start off saying that I have multiple echo devices in my home.  I love them. A lot. But after all these months I've come to the conclusion that my Echo Auto has to go.  It doesn't connect to other Bluetooth devices unless you have an Alexa app and that is a major pain in the butt.  It is pretty large for my Honda Civic and the wires are a bit messy.  Another  problem is that I cannot use the Bluetooth to make or receive  phone calls.  I just can't figure it out.  I can use it to play music but when I get a call I have to use the speaker on my phone.  It's frustrating to want to love something that just doesn't  love me back.

I have a newer car and phone so I am pretty sure neither of those are the problem.  So I don't recommend buying one just yet.

It's pretty responsive and only has problems when I'm driving away from my driveway and my phone is switching from wifi to data. I've had it drop connectivity to my phone once but I've had it for over a month now and haven't had it happen since day 3 of having it.I had been debating spending lots of money on a bluetooth capable system but this does everything I could have wanted from a new system and more!",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"I bought one of these in the summer when my slot on the beta list finally came up. I was so excited! I'd been waiting for months for it. I was on the beta list for the original Echo and now have two plus a dot. I loved the Echos. However, this one is hard to connect and then when it does connect, it will work for a bit then just stop for no reason.I also just read about the data it uses. That explains why we were going over our plan. I unplugged mine after a month of trying to make it work. When it did work, it was nice as I could send voice texts to people on my contact list, but it became too much of a distraction trying to make it work. I went back to my voice calling and hoping the person actually answers their phone.",1,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
Given the right situation I think this can be a very useful product. For me it has been really nice to get my phone audio to my car stereo without having to unplug and plug in an audio cable (my car doesn't have bluetooth connection).Most of the time the bluetooth connection works without any issue. The exception seems to be if I take my phone away briefly. For example if I run into a store for 5 minutes and then come back to the car the connection isn't always reestablished.,3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Not sure what is causing others connectivity issues. Mine worked fine out of the box. I do not need to reset it each time, or ever for that matter. It starts about 2-3sec after starting my car each and every time. Voice recognition is on par with other echo devices. For reference, I have bluetooth, it's a 2017 Honda and I use it alongside android auto without any issues. Love being too add reminders, calendar events and work home lights from the car, even from far away in another state (messed with my son while I was gone). Not sure if it's an iPhone issue others are having or what could be the issue. Would like it to be cordless but I do get better sound ot if pandora since it isn't. Overall I've been pleased with its performance.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
EXCELLENT CONCEPT! THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE INVITE!! I LOVE THAT I AM NOW HANDS FREE I CAN TELL ALEXA TO CALL SOMEONE AND SHE RETRIEVES THE INFO FROM MY PHONE AND MAKES THE CALL. MY MAIN USE FOR ALEXA IS MUSIC I NOW GET THAT EXPERIENCE IN MY TRUCK JUST AS I DO AT HOME.I TRIED TO CONNECT MY ECHO DOT IN MY VEHICLE PREVIOUSLY WITH SUCCESS BUT DEFINITELY NOT AS EASY AND ALEXA DID NOT HEAR AS WELL.,4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"The unit is small and compact and easily attaches to the AC/Heater vent (except in certain cars which Amazon lists on the spec page). You need a smartphone with Bluetooth as the unit works via the phone. Set-up was a breeze and basically it works just like your Amazon Echo at home (i.e. news, weather, audible, music etc.). The one thing I was not able to use it for was making phone calls which Amazon claims it can do, but maybe it is a set up issue. That was the only hiccup in an otherwise very simple set up and use. You can also use it to turn on the lights as you are arriving at your home if Echo is set up for that already , and basically anything you use the Echo for at home. That is very convenient. Price is a really good deal at 24.95",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I own almost a dozen Echos, spread throughout my home, and have loved them...This Echo Auto.....this is the biggest pile of crap that I have yet seen Amazon launch. I have yet to experience ONE, yes ONE single flawless connection between my phone and the Echo. I have an iPhone 6s, I allow background data, I have no restrictions against Echo, and yes I CANNOT, EVER, actually get this to just freaking connect and work without fudging w/ the app for a minute, or restarting the Echo.",1,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
Edit: In the 12 hours since I have written this I have received a call and email from Amazon support to troubleshoot the issues I have been having. In the hopes that they will be able to help I have modified my review from 1 to 3 stars.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"This product is well made and seems very durable.  The device is most useful for streaming music from the phone and turning the car into bluetooth if you don't have it.  But the quality and dependability are very lax...  I ask alexa to do things and many times I just get the little blue light and ding noise but nothing happens.  I can open my music app or xm app etc on my phone and stream to it pretty well most of the time, but when I actually ask the echo to play music from those apps somehow it is very less responsive or doesn't connect to the network very well?The car audio from phone is apparently awful by what my wife tells me.  She says it picks up way to much noise and I'm not sure if the mount being in a car vent makes part of that problem worse by picking up the AC noise, but she can here me better just using speakerphone on the phone then over this thing.",2,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"Got the early bird offer so figured I would give it a try for the price. Quality is solid, my only hardware complaint is the clip on the holder which holds the usb cable is attached by a sticker. It only took a couple of days for that to no longer work. My guess is they will change the design or glue. I’m going to use some gorilla glue to hopefully resolve the issue.It works as you would expect Alexa to work. It hears your questions and provides the same quality as my home units. I have 2 things that Personally frustrate me and make it less useful for me and my family. First, I was hoping it would be able to use the microphone in the echo during a phone call because the mic in my wife’s car is horrible. When she calls me it’s normally hard to hear her and I thought this may be a solution. Nope. Second, I want to say “Alexa call ...” unless there’s a trick I don’t know I wasn’t able to get this to work. I could manually find the number in the app and tap to call but that defeats the purpose.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Wanted this since my son had it one.  The one he had had a flush mount for the dash.  MIne came with a mount to the vents which I do not like. It caused the wire to be in the way while driving.  I tried to see if there was a flush mount but it isn't available.Other than that it works fine.  It has most of the capabilities of the Alexa at home.  I think I tried to set a reminder while on an extended car trip and she said she wasn't capable of that right now. She did sinc to my calendar which was convenient.  Also, my BF still has a flip phone so streaming Amazon music from state to state kept me from having to find new radio stations . That is a big plus.  Made it easy to get rid of the expense of satellite radio.  All in all, I am happy with it!",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"I got this prior to full release and was so excited. Unfortunately it has been a disappointment.  It often (50% of the time) tells me it can’t do what I ask at the time or doesn’t hear me. It was a pain to mount.  The cables are annoying.  It basically just acts as a remote for you phone.  I have ford sync which isn’t the best, but it doesn’t really do much more that that.  Since I paid $25 I’m ok, but if I spent $50 I would have returned it.  I thought it was a stand alone device that used your phone for connectivity, it’s not.  It just connects to your phone and acts as a mic and speaker for Alexa in your phone, then it screws up your request.  I love every other Alexa device I have, this one just isn’t good.",2,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
Using with Iphone 11 Pro. I actually really enjoy the concept of this. It basically lets you control your phone through alexa. You can do this anyways with the alexa app but it needs to be open and you need to trigger it by pushing a button.My echo auto experience has been less than spectacular. I am a heavy user of alexa at home with full home automation integration everything from doors and windows to my television. The echo auto was easy to set up but unfortunately it only works for a few seconds after power up. Then i need to reboot it to ask it another question. It becomes totally unresponsive. It is basically useless. You would be better of to put an alexa dot into your car and connect it via Aux.,1,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0

"The Echo Auto does everything the one in your family room will do, but only when it connects.  Since it basically works through a phone, it loses the connection regularly.  I often start it in the garage, when the phone is on my home wifi.  When I get out of range and switch to LTE, the connection drops.  Once on LTE, it seems to work fine, though Drop-ins seem to be difficult for it to handle.  The device apparently can't break the phone connection, even when I say ""stop.""  The only other major nuisance is the fact that every time the device connects to the phone, the Alexa App must be opened so that I can confirm that I'm a passenger, not the driver (which is not true, of course).  Why would that be required to use the device in the car?  Wouldn't it stand to reason that the person using the device in the car is the driver?  Isn't it more of a distraction and therefore more dangerous to require this extra step?  Some common sense is in order.  Something that I've been accustomed to Amazon using before such devices are released.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"This product overall is just a 3/5. I was very hyped for the echo auto as you would imagine, but there is always connection issues, in my opinion, because of beta, and other new features. Thus causing me to keep unplugging and plugging back in the power cord until the device actually responded to my phone- it showed connected through the app and Bluetooth, but alexa wasn't having any of it. When it works, its awesome for people who have Amazon Music Unlimited, because you can play any song or ask any general question. When it doesn't work, it is quite a pain to fix, and sometimes I just let it go for the day because I do not feel like dealing with it. Great though for the original price I paid of 26.99 while it was in invitation only.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"It was a Christmas present and I love it. With all of the Alexas in our home, it’s so much easier to drop in and talk to my children and remind them of little things. It plays music that isn’t on my phone and easier to make phone calls with my husband. I have a USB port and Bluetooth in my car so the aux cord wasn’t needed for me. Reading the reviews I was skeptical about getting it, but the when I received it as a present, I’m so glad I got it. It really does make life a little easier with how busy our schedules are.I do want to explain that I work for my City, my husband is enlisted, we have 3 kids and one on the way. Our oldest is in horseback riding, our second is in baseball, football, basketball and MMA, and our third is in baseball, football, and MMA.

"I started with my 2016 Lexus RX 300.  The unfortunate discovery I made is that, through my smartphone and my vehicle's nav system, I already have almost all the features offered by Echo Auto.  About the only missing link is access to my Amazon music play lists.  Sooo….I figured not all is lost!  I can install it in my hobby car (1988 Mercedes 560 SEL) that doesn't have all the features that my Lexus has.  Unfortunately, one of the missing features in the 1988 is Bluetooth, so, unless I purchase a bluetooth to FM adapter, I can't use the Echo Auto.Anyhow, my assessment is that the Echo Auto is redundant to the features already offered in recent-model cars, so there's really no need to make the investment.",2,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I have a bunch of fire tv and echo devices and had high hopes that I would experience similar Alexa convenience but in my car. Echo Auto has been very disappointing from the janky mount and cord holder to the miserable integration and reliance on the Alexa app. The Alexa app cannot play my iTunes music locally stored on my phone. The voice control is intermittent at best and the most common response to my requests is something along the line of “I’m having trouble connecting; when it is safe to do so, please open the Alexa app”. Now I have to tell the app I’m a passenger every time I open it to set my alarms or manage devices—even when I’m not connected to the Echo Auto. I was going to return it but opted to keep it purely as a $25 Bluetooth adapter for my car so I can charge my phone and listen to books or music at the same time. It’s not nearly as disappointing if you just pretend it’s not supposed to have Alexa voice control, but without that, what’s the point?",2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,1
"Sitting here being used as a paper weight, I cannot see the benefit to this unless you are totally in the Alexa system. I installed it twice and after a couple of weeks remove it.  My 2009 Corvette has no Bluetooth but it does have an AUX that works fine,  so I plug this into the AUX and now I have Bluetooth connection to the phone that connects half the time which was probably the most frustrating as it would disconnect and reconnect on its own, I also now have more wires running around my dash that looks sloppy.I will continue to just plug my phone into the AUX without this Alexa device and just say OK google and I can pretty much do the same stuff like ask for navigation, play music, make phone calls, etc.  Also you can use Android Auto on the phone and do the same.  Perhaps the array of Mikes may be better but I have not had any issues with my Samsung S10.  Bottom line, its just a redundant component that I see no need for.",3,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"In the first review I did I was upset that it would disconnect constantly and make me manually reconnect it on the app by unpairing and repairing it.  That was really annoying and tedious but now it has just stopped working, and that's much worse.  It worked well for the most part up until now.  I can say Alexa and it will glow blue and give the audible ping that it's listening to me.  It doesn't matter what I say there will be no response what so ever and it will just time out the request.  It is clearly hearing me because it wakes up, but it won't listen or react to anything I say now,  I have unpaired and repaired it as well as resetting it multiple times.  I have no idea why it won't work and nothing I do seems to change that.  Very unfortunate as I love using this product.  I have owned this product for around 5 months.",1,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"Update: Having the issue others are describing, random disconnects between the device and the app.  I dont know if this is an app issue or a device issue but when it happens mid-directions on the highway it becomes a little problematic as you cant just stop and get it going again; have had to go back to using google maps on my phone.  I still really like the idea of alexa in the car but as long as its dependent on an app on my phone I'm not sure how much practical use I will get from it.Its awesome having Alexa in the car, I can add things to lists that pop into my head when driving, check appointments, weather, everything and not take my hands off the wheel.  I can also set appointments to my calendar while driving (I sync Alexa with my Google Calendar).  Until I can afford a brand new car with all this built in, its an affordable way to gain the functionality and services Alexa offers.  The device itself is very small and light and fits easily on the vent.",3,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"For most cars that have carplay or something similar this is pointless, but my mini countryman does not have any way to play amazon/spotify/pandora so i appreciate this device when it works. It doesn't work all the time, randomly disconnects or says can't connect. It's also frustrating that it only connects to one phone...my husband and I don't drive together all the time so this is VERY pointless. If amazon can fix some of these bugs/annoyances then it may be worth the $20-30 price range for cars that can't have music easily. Before this I was connecting my old ipod so this is a slight improvement when again it works. I haven't even tried it for navigation, as I can't drive without seeing the road. Haven't tried it for much besides asking alexa for weather info and music.",2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

"When it works, amazing! When it doesn't, frustrating beyond belief.  I really wanted to love this product. But it only works about 25% of the time. I've been using it for about a month now in various locations as I travel quite a bit. This product obviously doesn't work when you don't have cell service. But even if you do have 5/5 bars, Alexa won't work most of the time. Sometimes she just doesn't respond no matter how loud or clearly I talk. If you're transitioning from wifi to cellular when driving away from home, she won't work because she has no connection. She won't play spotify. She says you have to have the Alexa App open which doesn't make this hands-free. My tip if you have an iPhone, don't buy this. Siri now works with Spotify.",2,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Ahhh so nice.  Having access to Alexa in the car is very helpful.  I first tried a Roav Viva, and it worked, but it had a lot of annoyances.

I would then launch the app and it would continue to fail more often then not.  I had a hard time getting it to connect and stay connected.  It became more of a distraction and frustration making it unusable.I think this might me more likely on iOS since it tends to prevent apps from running in the background more than Android does so I would guess this may be less of an issue on the other OS.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I've used this for a few weeks now.  I have several echo devices in my home that I use regularly.

If I have to turn off the radio, then select media just to ask her a question and hear the answer I might as well just use google on my phone.  We used the aux cable with and without.  The whole idea of this is to go about your normal driving, even while listening to the radio, she can still hear your questions.Simply not the case for us.",1,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Very difficult to keep it connected to my phone and the car. Really long delay between the wake word and hearing the notification sound that it was listening. I learned I didn’t need to wait for the sound, so now I proceed on. Only properly hears 60% of the time so I have to repeat myself a lot. I linked directions directly to Waze. When I ask for directions (after repeating myself twice) it always pops up a notification to accept the directions in Waze. If I am in driving mode as I should be when I’m driving, I never get the notification. I can’t pull down the screen and find it or anything. So, if I miss the first notification, I have to use Waze directly to get the directions. Pandora, Spotify, Amazon music all seem to work fine accept you must restart them every time you get in the car.

"I have an aftermarket Clarion Bluetooth radio in my 2001 Saturn SL.  The Echo Auto has helped bring my car into the modern age even more than the radio did.  I simply get into the car and it automatically connects with my phone in my pocket, I can ask Alexa to turn the volume up and stream my favorite stations and it works about 9 times out of 10.  When it doesn't work I have to pull out my phone and manually connect the Bluetooth to my radio which is kind of a pain but I think the issue is with my phone and radio more than Echo Auto, as it occasionally had the same issue before I had the Echo Auto.  I really enjoy that I don't have to mess with my phone to play something; it just does it for me and I can ask for directions, etc., and sometimes it works, but it definitely still needs some work in this area.  Most other things work the same as a regular Echo device in your home.  Sending text messages is hands free as well, which has been very nice.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"Very disappointing. The Echo Auto will not work consistently if at all.

She will respond ""Today, the wea---"" and that's it. Or if I ask ""Echo, what time is it?"" ""Currently, the---"" she cuts off in mid-word and never completes the sentence.So between the constant need to set up and reconnect, and the lack of usability, the Echo Auto has been literally useless, and this is after several sessions with telephone and email tech support.

My biggest issue is with the Echo Auto constantly losing connection with my phone. My phone has no issues staying connected to the blue-tooth in my car yet constantly disconnects from the echo auto WHY? Who knows. All it tells you is to go to the Alexa app to reconnect which rarely works once it starts disconnecting.  When the echo auto works I love it and being able to play my Amazon Music Unlimited with no commercials. The navigation also isn't very reliable when asking for the nearest McDonald's or any other nearby restaurant. It gave me one 30 miles away when in fact there were several within 5 miles. The echo auto definitely needs some work and some upgrades.

"I got this the better part of a month ago and it was really cool.  I can run my smart house from the car.  But the sound goes from working to not working. The volume is great and then I turn off the car and come back and the volume is low - despite making no changes.  It drops, it whispers,  and if you use the AUX cord, it has wires that hang out.  Now that I know I can use my phone app, the only thing this buys me is to avoid touching the speak button on my phone.If this worked consistently, it would be OK.  But that's not the case.  I'm keeping it because I payed $25 and I'll hope the software gets a new revision.  This is not the way to launch a new product.

Still others, it will serve up something that I wasn't looking for.Most of this can be remedied most times by restarting the unit but...it's a hands-free device. I shouldn't have to go mucking about with it at 65 miles per hour to get it to work. It's a shame, really because it was pretty cool when it actually worked but after the third time having to restart it in one afternoon, I literally yanked it out and started using Siri.

"I installed it in minutes.  Added it to my Alexa app.  Switched my car stereo (2013 kia soul) to MP3 play (like when playing music from my phone) and drove around rural area where the cell signals are very weak.  I streamed radio stations, ask to play a particular song, asked the time and temperature, asked her to place calls and more and not one glitch!  At no time did it lose signal.  I am very pleased with the Echo Auto.  I hope they have other mounting options.  Like a mount for your sun visor.  The vent mount doesn't like my car so much.  I was sort of able to use the mount to attach it to the sun visor.  This comment is for Amazon:  I signed up to be notified when the Alexa Autos were released.  I buy a lot from Amazon!  Get emails and messages almost every day!  BUT when Amazon sent 3 notices that I could buy it for $24.99 they went into my Gmails promotional folder and I missed them as I get a ton of junk in that folder and do not monitor it.  So why couldn't you send that email i waited on for several months formatted like all your other emails that ALWAYS go into my INBOX?  I had to pay full price because I never saw the emails.  But I think it is worth the $39.99.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,1
"I will agree with many here that say this is a beta version. It is half-baked. The problem comes mostly with the communication between the Echo Auto and the App. Whenever it says it can't connect, you have to manually go to the App and hit, ""I'm a Passenger"" for it to work. This does not happen all the time, but enough to make you want to give up. I haven't tried it with Bluetooth since my goal was to use it through the AUX on my older car.  There is no amp on the Echo Auto. On my car, the audio level needs to be cranked to near max. On my wife's car, which is new, the sound is fine. Your mileage will vary. When the Echo Auto does work, its fun. The kids in the back seat love being able to select music or listen to stories on command. And yes, the Echo Auto mics do pick them up from the back. I feel in a generation or two this may be a great way to modernize older cars. But for now, it's just a toy and not a tool.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I read many reviews on this product; no it isn't nowhere near AI but it's not bad; however, for $49.99 it's a bit high for an entry level Alexa.  Hopefully in its next iterations the VR will be better and it will not require so much repeating of ""commands.""  VR is my only complaint, but it's not a show stopper; I await for possible firmware updates - if possible with this device.  One user wrote ""This product requires you to open the Alexa app on your phone in order to run.""  This has not been m experience at all.  I simply leave the device plugged in, start the car, give it a minute or two for Bluetooth to sync and I'm off; not once do I have to touch my phone - not once!!!!!  That would totally defeat the purpose of a hands free device, so why would Amazon market such a device?!?  They wouldn't.  Keep in mind, and it's the way it was early with computer science,  products are released not 100% perfect but the manufacturers know any bugs will be revealed by the user community and will be fixed with updates, patches, firmware updates or upgrades.  So any blasting is usually no real indication of a product being a failure; just feedback a bit touchy.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

Only when a car can consistently generate its own wifi signal will this be worth having.Also, it has to be connected to your cigarette lighter at all times; it should have been made to be rechargeable so you don't have ugly wires in your nice car. Great idea that was put to market far too soon. Do not waste your money on this and just save up for a real one for your home or office.",2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0

Preface to this review:--------------------------,3,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
Love this little thing. It’s so easy to use. Playing SiriusXM stations or Amazon Music stations is a breeze. I can even ask Alexa to turn on my home lights or fan while I’m in the vehicle.  I love the fact that I don’t need to touch my phone to start playing music or ask Alexa any questions. Just use it like you would use a normal echo at home.Only issues that I have are..the usb cable and the sound quality. I wish the usb cable was shaped differently since it sticks out and just seems kinda unsightly. The sound from streamed songs can sometimes seem off. Haven’t figured out a way to resolve that yet.,5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,1
"Things I really like about it is that once you get it connected (which is a chore and generally requires expert assistance) is that you can access a ton of music types, games, radio stations and podcasts with voice commands.  It is a wonderful companion for a long drive.  Things I hate about it (beyond the chore of getting it connected right in the first place) is the long connection time required which makes it less than useful for short drives, the endless pitching of Amazon paid subscriptions (after a brief free trial), and its utter uselessness for directions and such.  For example, it will give you the city you are in and little more.  Ask for gas stations and it won't really distinguish if they are behind you, ahead of you or off on some tangent road as long as they are in the general vicinity.",3,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"After some trial-and-error, I got the device connected to my Toyota Camry Hybrid. Alexa sometimes heard me; sometimes didn't. Then when I turned off the device, my iPhone had been disconnected from the car and I had to go through that Bluetooth pairing all over again.I don't plan to return it, but don't expect to use it very often... if at all.",1,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"I really enjoy Alexa as a general concept and functionality. I feel like it brings practicality to every day life. Which is why I decided to purchase Alexa for my car because it’s hands free, I don’t have to search for songs while driving. It’s a safe bet. However, me yelling at Alexa to turn on and register what I’m saying is a little less helpful. Connecting to Alexa can be easy.. or sometimes it can be really hard. This is definitely a beginning stage of Alexa Auto where they’ll need to work out some of the kinks.. but once they do, I 100% would recommend it to anyone. Because regardless, it’s still safer than browsing for music, podcasts, calling or texting people while driving. Great idea coming up with this idea!! Love it.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I got one by invitation, I was so excited because I use echo devices in home.  If you have apple car play I don't know why you would need one at all, but I don't have apple car play and Siri is just plain worthless.  Anyhow, right away on the first day, it kept locking when i would do stuff on my phone.  The locking up and disconnecting with my phone was consistent the entire time I had it.  Next was I purposefully tried to use directions many times, just to test it out.  not one single time out of at least 10 did it ever get the address correct when it repeated it back to me.  ""Alexa, give me directions to 123 amazon street"", she would say ""ok, you want directions to 124 amazon street correct? ""  it was very strange, was always one or two numbers off.  I don't have this problem with google maps, Siri, my built in navigation,  so its not my voice.  Then when you would correct her and say, ""no I need directions to 123 amazon st""  she would say ""I'm sorry I cant help with that"".  But I was so frustrated with it locking up when I used my phone for something, that I just said screw it, and returned it.  I saw multiple complaints online with exactly my experience.  I know for sure I will get another one.  But it was released too soon.  They need to work the bugs out first, I'll wait for Gen 2.",1,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"You have the echo dot, or maybe an echo show. Well, I saw bad reviews on this and started to worry when I got it. However, soon as I hook her up in the car, synced to the phone and asked the first question it was like she was in the back seat. Your car stereo system (speakers) are playing her voice. She does all the features as the Echos, but she is in your car.Look they are getting smart cars now with her in them. This is for that car that doesn't have her. Trust me, ask the right questions and you get answers, have music played, get the news or weather you want. It is all there in your car.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
At the core it is a great idea. Alexa voice assistant in your car. I own over 20 Alexa devices from echo show various sizes to Amazon tap to echo dot and everything in between.  But the echo auto is horrible. The bluetooth connection is constantly lost and you have to reconnect to it while driving or unplug the device itself. Not very safe while driving. Epic fail by this terrible device. Do not buy this garbage. Oh and I forgot it does not recognize your voice. You say alexa 30 times and still does nothing.,1,1,2020-2-26,1,1,0
"I am the happy owner of Echo Auto.  It has helped keep me hands-free while driving.  I have tried it out in my old and new car though I did like it better in the older car only because the radio had the option of if the car turned off and the radio was set to Bluetooth mode then it would stay when you turned it back on vs my Kia soul every time I turn it off and back on it switches back to FM radio and I notice when I was able to keep it in Bluetooth mode all the time I got more use out of the Echo auto because it would be ready to go.I was caught off guard, mainly because I thought it would be the Echo Auto connecting to my car radio but instead its the phone that connects to the car radio and Echo Auto kind of like the middleman.  It does have an option to connect the Echo to the Aux in 3.5mm jack but I haven't had to test that out yet.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I would like to start off by saying I am an ALEXA slave.  My whole house is run by ALEXA.  She is my best friend!  LOL!  I was super excited to get an invite for the Echo Auto.  I was looking forward to the new concept and knew that it was going to be great.  Unfortunately, the Echo Auto fell a little short for me.  Mainly, the cord. I do not like the cord that powers this thing. It constantly gets in the way and winds around everything.  I have moved this thing too many times to count to find the right spot.  Overall?  I like it.  Love being able to turn on my house lights with a small command.  Love having a weather report or sports report at my fingertips.  If they can do something about the cord that would be great!!!!",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"When I get in my car in the morning, I go to the Alexa app on my iPhone and connect the device. Should I need to do this? I ask, ""Alexa, how is traffic?"" I get a pleasant update on conditions and a polite "" Have a good Day"" I then ask for music or news etc. I really enjoy this and the microphones always hear me. It gets frustrating when the response comes back, ""I am having trouble right now"" This happens often. This device needs to connect to my phone to connect to the network. If there is a week signal while driving, this device stops working. Even though other apps on my iPhone continue to work. I don't think we have a device issue here, I think it is an app issue. Without a better app experience, this device is not worth it.",2,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"This is a fantastic add on for those who's car radio doesn't have Bluetooth with pass-through audio. My Nissan Rouge only allows calls, but now it has everything due to this device. It is convenient to tune to a radio station with apps such as iheartradio or tune-in, so it's very similar to having satellite radio without the monthly bills! Add in that it offers voice to txt, navigation over the speakers, etc and it is a great deal.On the down side, the device can only do one task at a time. So if you're listening to the radio and get a call, you would then have to restart the radio after the call. Any notice you get on your phone comes through the device and interrupts the current operation as well. If you happen to say something similar to the wake word, the playback stops as well.",4,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"Hopefully something that others haven’t written much about; connecting.  It connected to my iPhone XS quickly and I never had any connection issues.  But to use Auto with my vehicle I had to exclusively use my head units’s Bluetooth Audio connection (Pioneer 4000NEX).  I thought I’d be able to connect Auto then use my radio like normal. And when I wanted Alexa she’d come over the radio like a Bluetooth connected phone call.  Instead I have to use Bluetooth Audio and therefore use Alexa exclusively for all my content.  I like being able to change XMradio stations on a whim and channel surf for the right song or something surprising.  While the Auto did work very well for all the Alexa features, just being tied to it exclusively was a bother.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I have been waiting for this! This tiny device - smaller than a phone - has been the upgrade my truck needed. I have a bare bones, no frills 2012 pickup with no aux, no USB, no Bluetooth, nothing, just am/fm, and now I'm thrilled to have ALL the streaming music, news, and podcasts I want. Additionally, Alexa is fun to chat with and play games with on long drives, easy to get directions and hours for nearby businesses, even receive and send texts without having to touch my phone. I connected the Echo Auto via USB to a cigarette lighter on my dash, then connect my phone via aux to an fm transmitter in another lighter outlet. Setup was as simple as turning on my phone's Bluetooth and my truck was online! This device has made driving much safer, less tedious, and more productive. Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"I really want to love this product as my Truck doesn't have bluetooth built in, but compared to other bluetooth devices that plug into my Aux port...the echo auto has to be one of the worse.Let me explain.  Setup took a while, which was annoying and it actually just connected on it's own after I tried multiple times to follow the instructions.  Next, if I ever have to disconnect it (which I do all the time because I park outside) it doesn't always reconnect.  I have to leave it unplugged for 15+ minutes before it decides to connect again.  No it's not my phone.  I have a Note 9 and every bluetooth device I own and tried works and stays connected outside the echo auto.  I hope they can update the device somehow, because there is no point in having this in my truck if I can't use it for half or more of my daily commute.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
I got this for my wife's van due to her not having a Bluetooth enabled radio.I used the Auxillary in provided and started the setup with her iPhone.,2,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"When this works as intended, it's a great tool for hands free driving. Voice recognition works well despite road noise, audio plays clearly thru car speakers, and Alexa provides some nice assistance. Playing music and changing stations is really simple by just asking Alexa.However, the device still needs improvement and its integration with the Alexa app could use a lot of work. It does not reliably connect to the Alexa app upon starting the car. I have to manually open the Alexa app in order for it to connect despite giving the app permissions to run in the background.",2,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"We were very excited to get this item but when we got it, it was slightly disappointing. The one thing we didn't like was the fact that wires are everywhere. One for the power and one to plug into the aux port (since we did not have Bluetooth). I think if the next version had a built-in battery (can't see why one wouldn't last for 10+ hrs), we'd have one less wire to deal with. I don't mind plugging it in to charge but having extra wires all over the front of your car made it an item that looked very busy just to integrate Alexa to your car. I think that connecting your phone to the car and using built in assistants are just as good as this device. I think it was a little too late in the game.However; it you are looking to get Alexa to your car, it will do the trick.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"Not sure what the negative hubbub is about but I love this thing.  Yes there are quarks,  I have to tell Alexa twice to play a song but wow, the sound quality just blows away satellite radio.  With the capability of echo you can play your favorite Sirius stations with a noticeably better experience.  Love the fact I have access to all my favorite tunes in the only place I can get away with singing them.  I've used the hands free navigation and it works ok but really the draw is the music.  Must have if you spend anytime on the road and you love to tune out.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,1,0
"Well, I've wasted about four hours of my golden years trying to get this thing to pair with phone and car. At first, it worked for about two minutes. I was elated! Next time I got in the car............NOTHING! I have been messing around with electronics, including echo dots, smart lights, smart switches, computers and cell phones and can have them up and running in five minutes. My house is 50% smart house, all done by me, so it's not an age thing. Unless I got a lemon, don't bother with this thing. The concept is awesome, but I won't have a problem living without it.Update. I just got off a chat with an Amazon tech, for which I spent yet another hour, but success! It is now working. I set it up in the house so maybe there will be another update after I put it back in the car.",3,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"Configuring the Amazon Auto was not very easy at first. I first had to remove every Bluetooth device that I had previously configured to Android smartphone. One thing to keep in mind is that I have several Bluetooth devices connected to my phone and never had an issue connecting any device via Bluetooth to my phone, until now. Once I removed all the devices I proceeded to add the Amazon Auto first and presto chango, Amazon Auto connected successfully! I then proceeded to connect all my other Bluetooth devices back to my phone, for example my Honda HandsFreeLink and other devices. So far so good, no issues connecting all my other devices back to my phone. Now I am ready to test Amazon Auto, first test "" Alexa play Spotify"" sorry I can't do that, your Spotify account needs to be linked to your Amazon Alexa mobile app. Ok, no problem here, I then proceeded to connect my Spotify account to Amazon Alexa mobile app and after a few minutes I was ready to test it again. Second test “Alexa play Spotify"" the music started to play however, the sound is choppy and static is persistent. I tried a different music selection however, the sound quality was still very bad. I then unplugged Alexa auto and connected my phone directly to the car via Bluetooth. Third test ""Hey Google, play Spotify"" imagine my surprise, the sound was crystal clear, it was not choppy and no static.  Okay, my testing may not be conclusive, so I am open to any suggestions.  How do I resolve the static, choppy poor sound quality issue when I use Amazon Echo Auto to play music?",2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I use this in my 2018 Subaru WRX (save the manuals!). No issues connecting to my iphone and to the car, that mostly works fine. The voice recognition though is frankly poor. I hope they are able to improve this over time, but it constantly mishears me. Also, I found the only way to give a command is to say ""alexa"" then wait an age for the sound, then say what you want... otherwise it doesn't get it. Not an issue with the home Alexa devices we have. It also cuts off the end of the audio for some of the responses Alexa gives, especially on Spotify. That said, it does work ok, and if they can improve upon the voice recognition then it's certainly a useful device and can be entertaining on road trips. I paid $25 as a invitee, I would be more disappointed had I paid $50.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"We love using Alexa in the car to put on our music hands free, opening our garage door hands free, asking for hours or locations, and my kids even use it to ask homework questions or just for curiosity.  Also we love playing Song quiz on car trips.  Overall it has worked pretty well.  It does drop connection on occasion in dead spots but seems to pick back up fairly quickly.  The cord holder that was stuck onto the vent adapter won't stay stuck but that is an easy fix if I can ever remember to get some double sided tape.  I love that it is fully integrated with our Alexa's in the house and we even have a routine set up so we can tell her when we are coming home and she will turn down the A/C and turn on the lights.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"I really want this to work, but its not quite ready.  If you want this to play the music you ask it for only then this is a 5 of 5 product.  if you want it to do nearly anything else then yo should skip it and move along.  Plays music flawlessly for amazon music, spotify, and pandora ( I haven't tried others).  it seems to hear you relatively well in all situations.  It will not set a route on my phone no matter what I do.  It will ask for a specific address, I will give it the address clearly, it wont do anything but tell me it needs a specific address again.  Calling people is spotty also, about 50/50.  I'm Not sure how something can work extremely well at one thing and do everything else extremely poorly.  my vote is to wait on the next one at this point.  Setup was simple for iPhone and Toyota Bluetooth radio.",3,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"I LOVE Amazon products but the Echo Auto is not perfect. It disconnects from bluetooth randomly and sometimes when you first get into your car it does not connect at all. If you are trying to use the speaker to talk on the phone it works great at first then the person at the other end will tell you it sounds like you're getting further and further away (this has happened more than once). It does work great when you are just using it to play music, Alexa is able to hear you perfectly. If you need to call someone and tell Alexa to dial the person, she again works great, unfortunately the calls are only clear on your end. With updates it make work better but for now she is sitting in my glovebox.",3,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"This DOES NOT WORK! Our entire house is Alexa enabled and we have many Echo/Amazon devices. This is by far the worst one of them all. It WILL NOT connect. I actually got it to connect one time, but it wouldn’t even wake up when I said Alexa (with no music on in my car).This is the such a waste of money and I’m actually really mad that I fell for this gimmick.When I sent Amazon a detailed email on the exact day that I installed it and set it up, I got an email a day later saying to call them. I would have liked some input (that’s why I emailed them). I already know Amazon was going to have me do a hard reset and go through setup again. I’ve tried everything. This just is garbage.",1,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"This gives me a lot of pleasure--when it works as it's supposed to. People should know that it does not install without irritation. (I had to take a stab at it four or five times before I got it working.) Overall, very pleased with it's functionality for a voice operated device, however--especially in a noisy car interior.The most irritating thing about it, though, was when I found out that, if my wife was using her echo dot at home, I could not use mine in the car at the same time (unless I pay a monthly charge). That would be justified if I had teenagers in the house (i.e., frequent multiple users), but I don't use the echo car that often. But I often use it traveling to do errands in the morning and my wife is using hers while she does house chores. You really need to squeeze more money out of me for that level of usage? I would suggest to Amazon, a two user exemption.",3,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"If you think this will work like the echo dot, or show- it doesn’t. It is simply a relay from the Alexa app on your phone to you car stereo. I really wanted something that would entertain my grandkids on the daily commute to and from school. I thought they would be able to use the “Freetime” subscription on this, but when I went to access it, I was informed by Alexa that “Freetime is not supported on this device”. So now my commute is filled with Jingle Farts. I Love My Kitty Kat, Bubblebutt and “Simon says Pearl is a Fart”. Followed by “Alexa Stop”. If you want directions, you have to make sure location services is “always on” on your phone. If you pay full price, its a waste of money. Wait until they mark it down to $24.99 - that’s what it’s worth.",3,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
This gadget works fine sometimes but mostly does not. I've had to call Amazon a couple of times to help me reconnect with it. I ask it to play one thing and it plays something completely different or it'll make a beep sound and not play anything at all. It's extremely annoying. They always tell you not to drive angry so it's a good idea to stay away from this thing for a couple of generations more or you'll be driving pissed off most of the time.,1,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
"I bought this as a novelty thinking I would just use it to listen to music. My car already has voice recognition for phone calls and can read my text messages to me, etc. so I didn't think I'd use Alexa for much more than the music. However, once installed, which was a breeze and took all of 5 minutes, I use it for many things. I especially like being able to drop in on my echo devices at home. I'm amazed at how well Alexa is able to hear me even when music is playing. I've used it to make phone calls, read my texts, drop in, ask about the weather, etc. I liked it so much I bought one for my sister.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,1,0
"I have over 20+ years of IT experience, especially working with hardware of all kinds. Testing, installing, configuring, troubleshooting. I never had more problems setting up than the Alexa Auto. It has difficulty connecting to your iPhone Bluetooth. It takes multiple factory resets of the Alexa Auto device to get it to properly connect. I was connecting to an iPhone 6. After the Alexa Auto finally connected to my iPhone's Bluetooth, everything seemed to be working fine, until I turned off my car and returned to use it the next day.  No matter what command I asked of Alexa, it kept responding, ""Having difficulty connecting to your phone"". And then I did the entire reset, and then factory reset and forget the Bluetooth connection and re-initiate it again. It works, but only for that moment. As soon as I turn off the car and the Alexa Auto is no longer powered on, when I return to the device, it can no longer connect to my iPhone and I have start all over again to remove the connection, factory reset the device and so forth. I really wanted this to work and I spent hours surfing knowledge articles from Amazon, as well as visiting various forums and YouTube videos for advice, tips, tricks and troubleshooting help. I just couldn't get Alex Auto to maintain a stable connection, no matter what I tried. I hope this review helps other's avoid the time, effort and aggravation I had to spend.",1,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"Not what it is made out to be. First off, the 2 wires running down the front of my car is a hazard and just looks so tacky for this ""modern"" piece of technology.  It basically does nothing great. I tried to get it set up and had to keep the Alexa app open for it to work. That seems kind of pointless if I want to text or call someone while I am driving I have to remember to open the app first? My car has Bluetooth connectivity for calls but it wouldn't work for this device. I had to have both the USB and the aux cord plugged in. Both plugs are on opposite sides of my main radio area so I had cords on both sides strung up to the Echo. The cords were way too long and too bulky for me to try and do anything else with my radio like even turn up the volume. It just doesn't seem like it is up to par with the rest of Amazon's Alexa capable items. I am returning it since it doesn't do as it said it would and is more of a driving distraction than a help.",2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

"I like the idea. I really want this to work. But it just isn't there yet.For me, I like the idea of Alexa in my car to (1) play podcasts, (2) play audible, and (3) stream music. Maybe directions. For each of these, the Alexa Auto can do it, but with fewer features than just using my phone. E.g., for podcasts, I can't change the playback speed through Alexa, but I can through the app. For Audible, I can't get NYT Daily to read through voice--I have to start the download from the app first, then open it through Audible. Streaming music is nice, but I can largely get that anyway through just using my phone. And don't get me started on maps--I want Google Maps showing me things, not Alexa trying to guess and figure it out.",3,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0

"I was one of the early people to get the auto.  I use it quite a bit.  I connect by cable.  In my case, I play music, get flash briefings, change volume on another echo device, listen to audio books, get two teens up in the morning..  yes, get people up.Echo Auto like most echo devices a allows you to dial a phone number.  You also can Drop In on another echo device.  I have an alarm on their dot for 6:15am when I am driving home, then I Drop In to make sure they are moving.  I check with Alexa for weather before I Drop In.  All from the driver's seat in the Pathfinder.  If I get a message, she reads it to me.  Love it.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"It is a functional product.  Whether playing music or getting directions, it elevates hands free.  I can make announcements via echo auto that play in my house.  I can start up music on all speakers, which made for a funny prank or two to those in the house.  Using the direct wiring means making the car appear a little disorganized, but still prefer to not having.For the negative, it worked well the first month.  Then the audio output stopped working through the Echo Auto itself.  This can be worked around by plugging audio out into my cell phone directly.  I.E. commands still made to Echo Auto, but play through is done through my cell.  It is a little annoying though.  All the individual components work, so still haven't figured it out.",3,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

However, (probably just how my car works) I have to press the Source button 7 times to get from radio to this device's connection. And then, more than half the time this unit doesn't connect. That's very frustrating, so I don't use it as much as I wish.  You also have to have music stations programmed into Alexa since you can't play car radio at the same time (different source). It uses the car speakers so that's not evaluated.",3,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"I was very excited to get my echo auto before they came out, but that excitement faded when I realized it was a slave to my phone. If my car didn’t have unlimited WiFi I wouldn’t have been disappointed with the Auto. It seems like Amazon left a lot of potential on the table and rushed to release the Auto. There are a lot of cars with WiFi, like mine, and giving it the ability to operate without being a slave to my phone would have made it a lot better. Also my car has OnStar, which is where I get my WiFi, and I can use Alexa in my house to start and lock my car so I was hoping for a little more OnStar integration. Obviously I don’t need to start or unlock my car while I’m driving, but OnStar provides me with a ton of diagnostic and other data about my car including telling me when I need an oil change. I can even schedule service through the OnStar app. Some of that, he’ll all that, should be available through Alexa in my car. For example my car won’t start telling me I need an oil change til there’s 5% oil life left, Alexa could tell me when there’s 10-15% oil life left and ask if I’d like to make an appointment go an oil change.",3,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"I was early adopter of Echo Auto via invitation which recently stopped powering on, so I purchased another. Maybe (hopefully)  it was a hardware flaw that has been fixed in later revisions. I am connecting with my phone using bluetooth for calls and the audio cable for music.90% of my use case for this device is being able to voice control streaming amazon music so I could get rid of my SiriusXM subscription. Device has decent integration with the Amazon ecosystem. One thing they need to fix is when internet connection is dropped or in dead zone, Alexa will beep as if command received, but then do nothing, which is infuriating. Alexa calls/text messaging is ok. Device meets the purpose I got it for, but there is room for improvement.",3,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

"It works really well, when it does. To get it to work however, you need a phone with good service and constantly need to have the Alexa app open. I wish Amazon would integrate Alexa better into at least Android. However there is that magic moment when you ask Alexa to okay a specific song from your Spotify and it happens. The talk to text is ok, it always sends this weird message saying it's Amazon which is weird. But overall it's good and improving.",4,1,2020-8-30,1,1,0
Luxury and convenience. My dream come true. I already have Alexa in my kitchen and bedroom so I feel this is such a luxury to have in my car. It is thin and small just like the size of a cigaret lighter. Easy to install; it plugged right into my Lexus hybrid 350 sedan. My car vents don't fit the Alexa auto holder so I just leave the auto Alexa unit in my cup holder or sometimes put it in the console hidden; still works.  Make sure you have location services turned on in your iPhone to get directions from Alexa in your car. I didn't see a touch screen but I do like the blue light that appears on the device when Alexa is prompted to do something. Alexa does take a minute to connect to the car when the car starts up; so be patient. Love this device.,5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Sadly, I have yet to get this thing working, have had it for months. Tried to get it working a couple of times spending much time in my car. Then, I would think I am ready and nothing, it kept telling me to complete set up that was completed. I have had too long to return so, just going to give it away. Perhaps it is me but, reading these reviews, I think not. I have a blue tooth in my car and Alexa made a great sound when I started the car but, she never turned green or spoke to me. I gave up. I did have it for a few months before I even tried to use it as I kept forgetting about it so, sure it is way too late to return, otherwise, I would.Maybe they will improve the gadget but, I feel for reserving it and getting it right away....",1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I am an Alexa believer. I have five of them in my house and love every one. She is a family member. But the one in my car sucks. It just will not stay connected to either my phone, my car's audio system or the internet. I try and talk to her and I ALWAYS get one of those responses. Something she can't connect to. I think in the entire time I have had this car unit (more than six months), I have only been able to use it three times. Otherwise when I say Alexa, she says, ""I am having trouble connecting to the internet."" I pull over and make sure she is paired with my phone, and she is so I try again and it works...until I turn the car off and then when I get back in, same problem. Totally sick of it. And the thing that really ticks me off is that there is no tech support. Of course my home Alexa's don't need any but this product surely does.",1,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I got the Echo Auto for half price during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals.  For that price, I'm pretty happy with it.  It was easy to set up- the biggest issue I had was that I wanted to use the AUX rather than Bluetooth, just for sound quality and not to be as big a drain on the battery, and had an issue since my phone was already set up for Bluetooth audio, so I had to set my phone audio correctly.  I haven't have the disconnection problems that some people have, but do have to repeat my Alexa requests a couple of times before it will be recognized or the device will respond.  Often enough to be annoying, but overall I still like the device.  Hopefully it will get better with newer versions.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"First let me say I have a 2015 Ford Edge that has Bluetooth capability, and a phone with a cellular plan that has a decent data plan and cell coverage. With that said I was able to get Echo Auto up and running in 2 minutes. I had no connectivity issues either while setting it up or while using it driving. I do not have it clipped to my air conditioning vent, instead I have it tucked under my Dash and it seems to work fine there. I love it because I think of a lot of things in my car and it allows me to put them on the list very easily. It's also super easy to ask it any other questions you might have about anything. It does require internet access to be able to do these things however so you must have a good data plan. I don't think it uses a lot of data for what I use it for, making lists asking simple questions Etc.So far I love it. I will update in 3 months",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
"Why has the ability to change the wake word been removed on this device? Why???That unique feature is the only reason I bought any of Amazon's voice assistant devices, but for no apparently reason (and without mention anywhere), Amazon decided to make that feature ""not supported"" on the Echo Auto.  This would be a 5-star review otherwise, but writing any more just feels like a waste of time.",1,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
"I’ll start buy saying these other detailed reviews are spot on.  It took a while to get it connected to my car.  I’m pretty sure I had to add the device twice before it would work.  I’d say it’s done what I’ve asked 3/10 times.  I’m actually not quite sure why I even bought it cause I’m not a fan of Alexa.  I’ve mostly used it to just play music but that hasn’t been very intuitive.  It struggles to connect to my phone and isn’t fast enough for me. The vent clip is too big for my liking, I don’t want to see it above my dash. I used the magnetic sticky pad.  I wish all the Alexa electronics worked like google does. This thing is disappointing, especially after waiting after the request for so long.  Can’t say I’m going to keep it.",2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"Overall it’s a fun cheap toy to have Alexa fire up automatically in the car. My car seems reasonably quiet on the road but I still have to raise my voice and direct speech at the device for good pick up when in motion at highway speeds. The main drawback to this device is that it’s really just a Bluetooth microphone and you have to first launch the Alexa app on your phone for it to work, at least in iOS 13. If you forget to do that before you start driving then it doesn’t work because the app prompts you to confirm you’re a passenger before accepting commands. Nuisance. The other thing you find out pretty quickly is there’s really not much use for Alexa (yet) when you’re on the road. But if you’re a geek like me it’s a fun toy to explore some.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"It’s an Echo for your car. It was a little fussy to install (hardware was simple and clean, software seemed a little rough around the edges), but I managed to get it going after a few tries. I kept it for a few days, then eBay’ed it. I find the BT connectivity to my iPhone works better - less fiddly, one less device to keep track of, fewer cables, and in the boondocks where I live, there’s often not enough signal to connect to any device to begin with. I have a bunch of other Echo devices and use them constantly, but they’re on WiFi. The Echo Auto hardware is nice - small, clean and well designed and would likely have been much more useful if I lived in an area with decent cell service.",3,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"This device does have potential, but I almost returned it initially. I didn’t like the air vent mount. It looks tacky with the cord, so I just rest the unit next to my shifter. Your Bluetooth MUST be on. A few times a week, it loses connectivity with the Alexa app, so I end up fittling with my phone, which isn’t safe while driving. The response time after saying “Alexa” is also very slow, especially compared with my regular Alexa devices at home. On a positive note, I love the flexibility of asking it to play a song or what the weather is. Of course, if you use the USB port in your car to charge your phone, this device won’t work. After having this device for almost a month, I would recommend, but I do hope amazon continues to send out updates to make this more functional.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Total waste of money even at the $25 I paid for it.  Huge pain to set up.  Can’t get it to work so that Alexa is available and able to take calls through my cars Bluetooth.  It only seems to work if I don’t connect my phone to my car, but it doesn’t allow me to take calls through echo auto.  I have to take calls through speakerphone.  Totally worthless product in today’s world of technology.  I’ve also noticed it really drains my Apple watch when streaming music through echo auto.",1,1,2019-10-21,1,1,0
"I love the Echo devices in general. The Echo Auto is my most recent purchase and I think it needs time to “grow” and learn more speech patterns.  When I ask for “new” music from an artist, it says “can’t find “no” music from that artist.  No matter how clearly I say “new” it doesn’t matter. I have changed my request in the car to “recent music” and that works.  My Echos in my house understand “new”.  I love the fact that I no longer need to touch my phone to play the music I want to hear.  Actually, I did realize shortly before I received the Echo Auto that I could use Alexa on my phone to play music, but it is not as convenient as the Echo Auto.  Also, it is great to ask it questions while driving.  I would definitely recommend this device to anyone who already appreciates the convenience of the Echo devices.  I’m looking forward to utilizing more of the features, like turning on lights before I go into the house. The potential of Echo devices is great!",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"When I first bought my Echo Auto, I didn't expect much.  It was so small that I didn't think it would work anything like my other Echos  I own two that I use constantly in my house  However, once I started using it, I became more and more impressed with it.  It handles all of the functions that my indoor Echoes do, although perhaps just taking a second or two longer to respond.  However, that may be due to the mobile phone signal more than anything else.  I bought one for my single cousin as a gift, and she loves it and uses it for company when she is driving alone.  As far as it's music capabilities, it will play hours straight through, and is perfectly compatible with my car's infinity sound system.  It's an excellent choice, and money well spent.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I love Echo Auto. It makes the driving experience awesome. I like being able to ask Alexa for directions,  play Audible, play music from Amazon Music or Pandora. I don't like the mount, the shape makes no sense and the cord holder broke off. I haven't been able to figure out if I can ask Alexa to play a specific title. She seems to only play the last audiobook even if I request a specific title. Also, if I'm listening to music and get a call and send to VM, I have to manually hit play to continue.  Alexa won't do it.  When you say ""Alexa"", the acknowledgment sound is very low compared to Alexa's voice.The pros definitely outweigh the cons and I think it will just get better in time.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
I love Alexa. But I’m sorry. The auto version has been a huge disappointment. First big problem is a vent mount. The air rushing past it combined with normal road noice gives me reason to have to shout at her to get her attention. The regular volume of the radio has the same effect. Listening to music ironically being played by Alexa renders her blind (or deaf) to any further communication. I have to wait for pauses in the music to shout at her for attention. Then she often confuses what I ask of her and goes off on some wild tangent feeding me information on something I really didn’t inquire about. Sorry. But somehow her ability to hear in the car must be improved. I had really looked forward to taking her on the road with me.  She’s not proven a good travel companion though.,3,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"I have an older car with no hands free, now with the alexa i have hands free.  works about the same.

"We have enjoyed the convenience of Alexa in our home, and this device has not let us down in our car.  I love the fact that he can now do things in the car by voice command like switch to a different Sirus XM station or one of the stations we listen to from other cities.  When I'm not in the car, I know he will be safe by not fumbling with his phone trying to do all of these things.  Recently, we went on a small road trip and told Alexa to play various songs from Amazon Music Prime.  What great fun it made for the trip to sing along to songs we have no tangible disks to play on the CD player! We haven't tapped into its full potential because we still need to enable some features, but thus far, we love it.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

It is completely and utterly useless!",1,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
"First and foremost, the connection to the car speakers is hit or miss. The only way I can get a reliable connection is by cycling the power off and on.

We love the idea that after dark we can ask alexa to turn on the house lights just by speaking in the car.  We tried to use Alexa to play Amazon music on our was home from a 12 hour trip and was only partially successful.  Compared to our devices at home this item seemed to have a harder time to complete to task of finding music to play.  This device also seemed to have a harder time following voice commands (with the exception of turn on the house lights).Sound from Alexa could also be better.  Again it was difficult to enjoy the music when she was able to play any because the sound was way to low.  Maybe we will have our sil take a look at it and see if it is actually the device or user error!,5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"Like the ability of having to play my songs and access other data on the go.Here are some suggestions for improvements, first, ditch the power cable.

If I want to turn on/off lights in my house I just tell Alexa to do so, if I want directions or music I ask google to do those.

"When it works, it can be quite nice.  That is when it works.  I get so excited to get it to connect and then I use it to request songs from the Spotify app.  I have spent way too much time trying to get this thing to stay connected.  While I am a huge Alexa fan at home, this auto Alexa makes me wonder why Amazon would release such an inferior product.  I bought the product at half price and even though I could never get it to stay connected, I did not send back.  So hopeful but very disappointedUpdate:  Once I purchased a new phone things got so much better.  Now I really like my auto Alexa although not as much as my home Alexa.  I use to listen to music without having to physically change anything which is safer.  I use to find out how long  my commute to work all be. Sometimes I play trivia.

"It’s OK. The device itself is nice looking and looks fine with the dashboard mount (vent clip didn’t work for me), but I really hate all the dangling cords. My car has Bluetooth for the phone, but it won’t connect to that, either directly or through my phone, so I have to plug it in to the aux input, which adds to the cords. So that could be improved, and having it run on a rechargeable battery would also be an improvement. It pulls up music pretty reliably and adds things to my lists pretty reliably. Pulling up directions hasn’t been great, or asking it to find Panera’s (or whatever) near me has been hit or miss. It would be great if it would offer a few choices, but it doesn’t. And when it does pull up directions, it requires that I touch a confirmation on the screen, which is an unnecessary distraction from driving. Also, the response time to commands is often very slow (and sometimes not at all) in comparison to Alexa at home. I’m guessing that has to do with the fact that the data is going through my cellphone rather than my home WiFi, but it’s not at its best yet. So it’s a decent start, but there is definitely room for improvement.",3,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0

I have an iPhone, so map navigation is a little irritating when I have to touch the notification, and I don't like to wait for my choices when I ask for a particular business. Often, I start navigation myself without using the Echo Auto.It works seamlessly with my built-in handsfree for phone calls, and Alexa has never made a mistake with any contact.",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,1

Third, the voice recognition need work. When listening to music I had to shout at it to be picked up by the microphones, to ask it another request.

I got it installed easily enough, my 2017 Ford came with Sync 3, which connects to my iphone, and honestly, works more seamlessly than the echo.  To use the echo, I had to change the input on the radio to blue tooth, whereas with Sync 3, I could ""talk"" to Siri on my Iphone without having to change the radio.  The Echo was just more cumbersome, and didn't really add anything.  I gave it to my son to try in his older Dodge pickup.

"The Echo Auto (EA) is a great idea but it has some issues that aren't necessarily the fault of the equipment. I found the EA worked best parked in front of my home: once in motion, there were frequent interruptions to the service so playing music would pause, games or other interactions would abruptly stop and frequently Alexa could not respond or was unable to function unless a solid cell signal was available.There was also an issue with bluetooth audio and a few times audio from my phone would play at the same time as the EA leading to a cacophony and making both devices useless. In those instances, there was no way to command EA to remedy the situation leading to silence until I pulled over. During a trip, this would negate the purpose of the EA.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

"Has to reinitialize every time.  Device is powered down as if unplug when the vehicle is turned off.  At this point it is not working at all after a couple ignition restarts.  Poor system integration with existing CarPlay.  Amazon should focus on integration Alexa to Apple CarPlay and Sync rather than add a new device.  Device does not mount well with my Jeep.When it does work, it is handy to remotely access my home automation.  Outside of that has not been worth buying.  I can do that with voice commands to my iPhone to the Alexa App.  Would make some sense to have Alexa App integration with Apple CarPlay and not need an additional device to power up with the vehicle’s ignition.",1,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

I struggled for a couple of days before the Echo Auto functions smoothly -- partly because I was expecting a plug and play consumer product, partly because it was not the most friendly design and the instruction was insufficient in case of trouble shooting. It randomly connected and disconnected during those couple of days. You basically need to setup your Alexa app to constantly run in the background on your phone -- once you've done that, it will be smooth sailing.",3,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

I can only use it for long drives as it takes too long to connect and get running for a short drive. I have a classic car without Bluetooth but have a Bluetooth adapter that works great with my phone or with other devices but Alexa takes longer to start working even though it has connected. I am also used to using a different wake word in my house so it makes it difficult to remember that I can't change her wake word for Echo Auto and have to call her Alexa. Really, it should have the same features and work the same way the in-home devices work. It feels like Amazon rushed this out the door before it was fully baked. I still use it but unfortunately can't use it on the short drives just yet. I'm waiting patiently for you to give her the updates she needs in Echo Auto.",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

Using a Bluetooth connection leads to a lot of frustration with lag. The Alexa app has controls to account for the delay but the sliding scale isn't enough to properly calibrate to my Corolla. I frequently have Alexa pick up on lyrics from my music because the interruption didn't line up properly to only capture my voice. I have a much better Alexa experience using an aux connection but then I can't see song information or messages on my Corolla's display when using it.I liked the idea of having a voice assistant in my car for remembering things randomly and adding them to a list or to randomly look ideas up on Google. It's just too frustrating dealing with the delays and voice misunderstandings. I now just use Alexa on long road trips so that I can send handsfree texts.,3,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"like this as far as games go. I had no problems hooking it up. The vent clip is a joke tho. Here in New England the heater is running and I’m afraid I’m going to burn the insides out. Plus it can’t hear over the a/c either. I do have a decent gps in my car, so it’s the music for me. You can’t replay when you’re streaming like you can with your phone. It’s basically a dot for the car, which is fine with me. It also will turn on your lights which is nice vs having to use your phone app. I guess it’s what your preferences are. I just need a place to put it where it can hear me and not this huge junky clip for the vent. I’m sure Amazon will come up with something in the future for this.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0

I have a large number of Alexa devices; the original echo, the tap, the show, multiple dots, bunch of Kindles, etc.  Needless to say, I love Alexa.  I paired this with my 2017 Toyota Camry and just couldn't get the thing to work reliably.  Did the tech support thing, tried tons of configurations, it was just awful.  I thought the device was defective and even tried to get another one, but Amazon was actually giving me a difficult time returning it for a new one.  I truly believe Amazon knows that this thing isn't ready for primetime or maybe they should just say this is the list of vehicles that we have success with.  I've been a Prime member since they launched prime and rarely do I get frustrated with Amazon.

"Overall, it's a great idea to extend Alexa out to the car, particularly for the voice command of directions, lists, books and all the things I enjoy it for at home. Specifically however it does have some short comings, like the clip that holds it to the vent. It doesn't hold well and keeps falling. The cords seem to always be in the way. I also have not once turned the car on and found the device to automatically connect. It seems to require setup each time which is a total nuisance. I love the size of the device and that it detaches easily for security reasons, however that ease of removal causes it to fall off the base at times.I am an avid fan of all things Amazon Echo, owning at least 5 of them so I was thrilled to get an invite to purchase in advance of the full price.

"I accepted this item as a free gift from my insurance company.  However, I am not yet sure of the benefits.  It does allow full hands free activation, as opposed to using the Sync system installed in my car.  However, that simply eliminates the need to hit a button before asking for assistance.  I do have to make sure my car system is in blue tooth audio mode, which means I cant move back and forth between Alexa and my radio stations.  So far, I have not discovered any abilities of the Alexa that are not already available through Sync.I have also discovered that whether I am in my car or not, whether my car is running or not, and even if I unplug the Alexa, my phone seems to continue to be connected to Alex Auto, or the Alexa auto seems to become disconnected, and can't reconnect when I get in my car.  This means any time I go to search for anything on my phone, I have to identify myself as a passenger in my car before it allows me to use my phone.  I have only owned it for a couple of weeks, so the verdict is still out, but as to date, I am not impressed.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"I like that the bluetooth connects every time, I just have to say ""Alexa"".  I can then play music through my non-bluetooth music car stereo.What annoys me, is that even though it is connected through bluetooth for audio, the Alexa voice command is not automatically connected to my phone.  So I constantly have to go into the phone app and open it.  Sometimes it connects when I do that, sometimes it does not.  Most of the time I don't even bother reconnecting Alexa.",2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0

"I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and have found it flaky. When you first get in the car, it will always tell you it lost the connection with your device. I’ve learned it takes a minute or two to connect after starting your car, so you have to pull out in silence and then start your music while driving. Often this works; other times you have to unplug the cable to kill power and plug it back in to resolve a connection issue.I like that it generally hears me well even closed in my console, beneath the cover. I don’t like the roll-of-the-dice responsiveness. It takes a second or two after the wake word before it plays the recognition sound, and doesn’t tell you when it doesn’t understand a command. Sometimes you hear another sound, sometimes you don’t, and since it sometimes takes several seconds to start playing a selection (much slower than other Echo devices—I have a Gen 1, a spot, and a Gen 3 Dot at home; it’s closest to the Dot, but a little slower), it’s hard to know if it is working on it or just missed the command.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
This device worked really well and will be great for most people.  Ordinarily I'd give it 5 stars.I gave it 1 star so hopefully this review will get more attention and assist some people who use hearing aids.,1,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto is so much better than having a satelellite radio system in the car.  The voice recognition works perfectly (even for those fortunate  people with southern accents). I have factory navigation in both my vehicles but gave up on voice commands. TheEcho  verbal navigation instructions are so much safer and precise than the oem navigation. Anyone who has used an Echo knows about the capabilities including music, weather, news, sports scores, etc.. The mobile version works just like the ones I have at home.The mounting bracket is really well designed and sturdy but I find it better to just place the little echo on the ledge of the navigation screen to keep it out of the sun and also out of sight from thieves.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"IT seems a good idea, but it is always disconnecting from my phone and can only be reconnected by unpairing and forgetting and beginning from scratch EACH TIME. Who has time to unpair and repair each time one gets in the car? I wish that it worked better and did not always lost connection with the phone and the app so that it could be more useful. Kind of sad that I have to write this review, I was expecting so much more from an amazon productEdit. Support really did try. I took the steps they recommended to stop it from forgetting the app and connection but still find myself having to forget and repair any.time I get into the car after a couple hours of being away.

"The best echo device for your car, hands down.  I have used the Garmin speak with alexa and Roav viva with alexa, for my vehicle and the echo auto is the best experience I have had with alexa in my car.  Everything you need to set up the echo auto is included.  I had mine set up within 3 minutes, including watching the welcoming video after set up.  Starting with the vent mount, I feel this is the most logical design. The mount fits nicely in the vent and the echo auto itself sits securely on the mount magnetically.  There is an indentation on the bottom of the echo auto that helps it fit nicely. No sticky tape, etc.  There is a small tilt on the mount that directs the eight microphones towards you.  This matters because using a third party device, like the Roav viva, I found myself having to yell at the device to hear me, due to the design of it just sticking into the ""cigarette lighter"".  I thought the cord would bother me with the echo auto, but there is a cord clip that manages the power cord and it kinda just ""tucks"" along the side console of the dash.As far as functionality, the echo auto is a winner.  With the other devices I mentioned, it seemed like it took forever for it to ""boot up"" when I got in the car and it was never clear when it did. Sometimes it would take me messing with it halfway out the neighborhood until I knew it was on.  With the echo auto, with my phone never leaving my pocket, it boots up in a matter of seconds, there is a nice little chime to tell you it is good to go.  I am able to arm my ring security system as I am pulling out of drive, check my commute, and put on a podcast or listen to an Audible book.  I am able to use the alexa ""drop in"" feature to call the kids at home and also use it to make regular phone calls.  on the way home I can ask alexa, to adjust my thermostat (Nest) and to turn on my lights in the house.  When I pull in the drive I am able to disarm my home security with my passcode. I dont experience any lags or time issues between me asking alexa something and the task being completed. It is really great.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Ok i will start to say that i have several alexa products at home. the echo show is by far the worst of amazon products. i dont rememeber when was the last time i used.1. you ask alexa call...... . answer.

"Getting started was quite simple, and I found a great spot to mount the unit...however, now it's like riding with an idiot on the dash. Alexa always had trouble answering my questions or functioning properly on my Echo Dot at home. I felt pressured into this purchase with the ""invitation about to be revoked"" email sent by Echo Auto...and it was so cheap, I had to try. I thought it would be nice to just call out the next address for directions for my mobile business.'UURNT Wrong!  Echo Auto Alexa is like Echo Dot Alexa's cloned sister with missing brain cells and will route your destination out of state to the Midwest. Google Assistant and I have been friends for a while.

"Amazon really dropped the ball on this one.  If you share your car with a family member, e.g. your spouse, and your spouse has his/her own smartphone, you're out of luck: this device will only pair with one device.  And if your spouse has his/her own Alexa account, you're out of luck again: this will only pair with one Alexa account.  I have to knock this down to one star because these shortcomings are not shared by the Roav Viva, which provides the same Alexa-in-the care functionality, for half the price, is able to pair to multiple devices and will work with multiple Alexa accounts.  That proves the functionality is quite possible, and I'm hoping Amazon will realize how important it is to have it.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
I run a business and often travel to people's houses and have to take calls and schedule appointments. I like that I can tell Alexa to schedule appointments/take me places and place calls through the device. I do have an older Toyota Prius and it plugs into the Aux input and let's me blue tooth stream/make calls etc.The only downside is on occasion Alexa stops responding. I tell her to play music and she keeps listening for a while and then does nothing. When that happens I have to unplug it and plug it back in.,4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"This product was easy to set up in my vehicle, especially with the app on my phone.  I am still learning what to use it for as I own a later model vehicle that already has all the bells and whistles, including surround sound, Sirius Radio, voice dialing, etc.  I certainly think I would use it more if I had an older vehicle but I am enjoying figuring out exactly what features to use it for in my truck as I use my home devices all the time.  When I am gone and returning home, I think I will be using it to turn lights on in my home to keep me from having to arrive to a dark house.

"I like all things Echo. I have an original Echo, a Dot, and now Echo Auto. It integrated well with my phone (Android) and plays well through my car stereo. It's nice to be driving and ask for directions and then they pop up on your phone. Total time saver and much safer. The reason for the 3 stars for Voice Recognition is because it doesn't always hear me. I tend to listen to my music at a loud, but comfortable level and the Echo Auto has a hard time hearing me over the music. I have it in a Jeep Wrangler and not sure if it's because the way the speakers are arranged, but it fails a lot.  Other than that, it is a wonderful addition to my Jeep. The Voice Recognition issue wasn't enough of a problem to warrant deleting a star.",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I purchased this when it first came out thinking that it would be the perfect solution to my car not having a Bluetooth connection.  The issue is that it is not reliable.  It seems that about half of the time that I turn my car on, it has automatically disconnected and will not reconnect unless if I go through the procedure on the phone app again.  It is a nuisance and takes 3-4 minutes to do.  The audio quality is average, but others have told me that it is hard to understand me when I am driving and talking on the phone through it.

"I have an old car so I had to use AUX. but it was easy to install. The box had everything I needed.  I didn’t give it a 5 star review because it sometimes looses the connection and it’s a pain having to install it again.Having said that, I realized, if I drive a 1/4 mile or so it will almost always reconnect by itself. I also dislike having to disconnect it and put in my purse when too hot or too cold. That means going through the reconnection process when I get back in my car.",4,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

When I set it up in my car the test of it going through my speakers worked fine, however when the setup is done Alexa does not respond.the blue light comes on but nothing happens.  Very disappointed.Update: I received a call from support and the suggested I bring it in the house and plug it into a power outlet with the phone nearby so it could do an update. That worked but I haven’t had a lot of time to use it.  The one problem that is outstanding is that the vent mount does not work in my vehicle.  It would be nice to have gotten the dash mount like others had said they received or at a minimum tell me what to order. Right now it sits in the cup holder!",3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"This review is hard to write because I have such mixed emotions about the echo auto. I LOVE the concept. I have it connected via AUX cable to my car and that part works great. The sound quality is great for music and everything else. Other than that the product is wonderful when it works. The problem is that it stops working way too frequently. For example I will have it playing pandora and then it stops playing with no warning. I try to start it back up, but it doesnt register anything I say. It hears when I say ""alexa"" and the blue light shows it is listening but it doesnt respond and times out as if I never said anything. At first I was thinking it was purely a problem with the device, but now that I have figured out a way to get it listening again I think the problem is with the alexa app. Whenever it happens I have to force stop and restart the alexa app on my phone. At that point it starts working again. But part of the reason I have the echo auto is to make my phone hands free. I cant pull my phone out to get it working again because I am driving, and the whole point of the device is to make it so I dont have to pull my phone out of my pocket while driving. I dont think I am frustrated enough to send it back, but I am hoping I find a more permanent solution in the near future. Some people say that turning off battery optimization on the alexa app fixed the same problem for.them, but that hasn't fixed it for me and doesnt seem to have fixed it for a lot of other people either. I plan to reach out to support and will update this review once I either have a solution or find out there isn't one.",3,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0

"I bought this for ONE Reason: to use my aux-less iPhone in a car that is too old to have Bluetooth but new enough to have AUX and USB ports (2011 Pilot).  Since Apple removed the aux/headphone plug from its iPhones, and since the aux to lightening adapters are crap and die, this Alexa Auto is the best solution yet.  I plug the Alexa into my car via aux plug, and then connect my phone to Alexa via USB, mounted on the dash, and viola.  I can play music and listen to books, which is all I wanted.  I can make calls, too, but the audio isn't the best.  This seems to still be in beta mode, as others have noted, and it has room for improvement.

"The Echo Auto is a cool little device.  I like the small foot print and the fact that I did NOT have to sacrifice any a\c vents to set it up.  Connecting it was interesting due to having it connect through my phone to access the stereo.  Making phone calls and dropping in on the  other Echo devices is pretty straight forward, but where the biggest issue for me, and maybe others as well, is the fact that you can't change the  ""wake up"" word.  This become bothersome when listening to the radio and having a commercial come on  for Amazon Alexa.  As soon as it hears it's ""name"" the system goes loopy.  I hate trying to tell it to cancel when it's following the instructions being given from the radio.",4,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
"I bought it, and yes it isn’t good. It takes a long time to connect. When I get in my car, my phone connects automatically with my car. With this, it doesn’t, and it takes a few minutes to finally connect. You have to manually touch your phone to set up different things, like gps. Amazon needs to make this connect automatically, and truly be hands free, so the person driving doesn’t get into an accident trying to use it. It will do simple things, but if it has to use a third party app just forget about the simplicity. The concept of this is great, Amazon has the technology, it really just has to put In a little extra tlc and make it what it can and should be. It’s not worth buying at this point, just like most other people say.",1,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"Great way to keep connected while in the car. Update shopping/to do lists, check weather specific to the area you're in, get driving directions, etc. The only things I would say need improvement is the need to keep the Alexa app open for it to work and that when requesting directions it takes a long time for Amazon Auto to connect with, open the default app and start navigation. I would also have expected the device to have access to the contacts list synchronized from my phone to all of my Amazon products (Echo Dots,Echo Show)  ie: ""get directions to mom's"" so that the user can simply say the name of the contact instead of speaking the address.  I'm still new to this particular device so I'm probably missing a setting that would resolve the few issues i have with it",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"ok, so it took me a long time to think about this review. I was selected for the invitation purchase, so I have had this for a while now. I imagine if you can keep the echo auto connected to the app long enough to really play with it, it may be nice.  And it is a struggle to get it to connect. For some reason I have to turn the volume all the way up on my vehicle (2018 Chrysler Pacifica minivan) to even hear her voice, music, anything at all. I really thought this would be the coolest of the cools but I am disappointed. The idea is there but it seems the tech is not. Can we ditch the cord and do some solar power? It is on the dash... I'm not going to pretend I am some expert but I guess I just expected more.",2,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I have the echo and the dot so I thought I would give this a try and see if it would be better than my OnStar or android auto/apple car play. The first problem I ran into is the mounting equipment it comes with, and I even got the vent clip to try and make sure I could mount it, doesn't work in my vehicle (2017 colorado). The vent clip doesn't attach very well to my vents without looking likes its jerry-rigged, and the standard adhesive mount requires a flat space that my truck doesn't have anywhere in the middle. So its either have it halfway attached on a sloping area or look jacked up on the vent. The second issue I ran into is the fact that it is constantly turning on from road noise or me talking with a passenger when neither of us are saying anything even remotely close to the trigger word. Third, when I want to use it, I have to turn the stereo way down and roll up all the windows or it won't understand me. I tried sticking it out, and unfortunately, it never got any better and I got too tired of pushing the button to shut it up. Now I can't find the box or anything so I unplugged it and tossed it in the trash.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
In reality this is nothing more than an input output module for the Alexa app. Voice recognition is not as good as it was with my Amazon Echo Input. Setup was much easier than the Input.Using the Auto the audio interacts with other apps running on the phone and can be troublesome. For example I run the Lyft app and if Lyft generates an audio notification then the music from the auto drops to half volume and stays there until the device is restarted.,3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"OK, I have had my Echo Auto for quite some time now.  I have resisted reviewing it until I had plenty of experience with it's operation and performance.  Let me start by saying I no longer listen to over the air radio anymore.  I get in my car and say ""Alex, play (Radio Station or Song)""  and it plays through iHeart Radio, TuneIn, or Amazon Music. I tell her to close my garage and my garage closes due to my smart switch, https://www.amazon.com/MHCOZY-Wireless-Switch-applied-control/dp/B0752P57ZG/ref=sr_1_152?crid=1P8TT0IJH2B4E&keywords=smart+garage+door+opener&qid=1571531271&sprefix=smart+garage+doo%2Caps%2C333&sr=8-152. I can ask for directions and it will pull them up on my phone through Google Maps.  I can say ""Alex, text (contact name)"" and send a text message while driving.  BTW, the latest update to this feature reads the text your sending back to you prior to actually sending it.Now, performance is very dependant on the hardware you have; i.e. your cell phone and car stereo.  I have a OnePlus 5 that seems to work quite well with the Android Echo app with very few issues.  One issue I see once in a great while is the Echo Auto app somehow closes on my phone and the the Echo Auto will not work.  I have only ran into this problem around 2% of the time that I have had this device; so it is a very minimal issue.  Next is my car stereo, I drive a 2006 BMW 330XI with an aftermarket Android head unit.  This head unit has underperformed since I bought it and has not been a very good experience on it's own.  This will also cause issues with my phone connection to it from time to time but it has NOTHING to do with the Echo Auto.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,1
"I was excited early this year to receive an invitation to purchase an Echo Auto. I use my home Echo all day long, and I love it. I wish I could say the same about the Echo Auto. I can't. After going through the connection problems others have discussed, I finally got my first one to work. For about a week. Then it died. I called customer service and they sent me a replacement. It also failed after working intermittently. The third replacement was received and it failed out of the box. I had many long conversations with customer service about this, and tried many of their suggested fixes None of them worked. I really want this product for my car, and I'll get another if and when they iron out the bugs. It requires a lot more time in the lab and a lot more testing.

When I go to the Alexa app, it says the echo is connected.  I thought that perhaps i had a lemon, but after reading the reviews, I think my experience is typical.

"The setup of the Echo Auto was super easy. I've got a pretty quiet cab in my truck, so the voice recognition worked well. I would say it works about 85% of the time for me.What I mean by that is there are numerous instances in which the Echo Auto is connected, but when it ""responds"" nothing actually comes through my speakers. I can switch to something like a Spotify and here everything fine. At other times I just have to repeat the question to get the Echo answer to ""fully connect"" it seems like.

I purchased in hopes that I would be able to be driving down the road and holler at Alexa to play my tunes.  The problem is I don't get good cell reception in much of the area I live.  This is essentially a great microphone.  If you are looking for a way to hide your phone away and still be able to narrate to it, I highly recommend this product.  I was hoping for something more than a microphone to connect to amazon music but unfortunately that's what I got.If as part of this setup, it could default to local music I would have given 5 stars across the board.",3,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
"All in all, a good add to the truck. It wasn't clear from the instructions that Echo Auto is a 3-way connection between the Echo device, your smartphone's Alexa app and the Bluetooth radio. The phone has to serve as the Bluetooth hub between them. i.e. Echo Auto does NOT pair/connect to the radio.) Once that is established, everything works as expected.One disappointment is that Alexa is tied to the manually set (Home) time zone so alarms, ""What time is it?"" queries do not necessarily represent your local situation.  Another is that the vent holder partially obscures the indicator LED due to the tilt angle and the retaining lip.  Finally, 2016 called and wants their USB-Micro connector back. They said they would offer you a USB-C in exchange. ;-)",4,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I was very excited when I received my notice that I could order the Auto.  I had high hopes that it would work just like my other devices at home.  It does not work the same.  Don't get me wrong the basics work so it wasn't a bad deal for $25 but if I had paid full price at $50 then I would probably feel like I was taken advantage of.  I think the product will get there someday but right now she needs more work to make her useful for everyday use.If your only option is to pay the $50, I would suggest holding off until all the promised updates I hear about while trying to get my auto to perform, have been completed.  You would have a much better functioning Alexa if you just use the app on your phone.  You have to have the app loaded and open on your phone anyways for the auto to function.  When you get in your vehicle plug up your phone, change your screen to always on and open the Alex app.  I know it may seem like a lot of trouble but to use the auto you have to have the app open on your phone and your vehicle's source tuned to the correct input.  If you want to ask Alexa a question while you are riding down the road listening to your vehicles radio, you will have to switch inputs to hear her response.  If you are going to have to push a button anyways back to my suggestion of running the Alexa app on your phone.  A simple tap of the Alexa icon on the app and you are off and running.  Either way you are punching buttons.",2,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"In my experience Echo Auto works intermittently when integrating through my vehicle’s iPod feature as well as the Bluetooth feature. When it works it’s great and when it doesn’t it is frustrating. I do a lot of highway driving so I had hopes that it would be better. Since this is first generation I am hope that the kinks will be worked out. I enjoy using the Echo and Echo dot in my home and was hoping for the same with Auto. When it works I can successfully use the drop feature to communicate with my family at home, add to my shopping list, listen to audio books and music. I do not like the wire that is used for charging and I am hopeful that there will be another mounting option other than the vent. Vent works for my vehicle but I see how this can be off putting to others. I received this free through my insurance company. If I had paid for it out right it would be returned.

It does not completely block your air circulation. It also elevated you Alexa so heater temperature does not damage it.My vehicle does not support Bluetooth streaming. However, you can connect your phone via AUX or simply use your phone as the speaker. If I’m listening to music, I just use this last option and it works great.

"I updated this review because I finally realized how much this little device is costing me! I wasn't even thinking about the fact for it to work, it has to use your cell phone to connect to the service. Which means it uses your data. My data usage suddenly went through the roof! So I reset my data usage statistics and sure enough, the Alexa app was sucking up data by the bucket load! And I mean gigs.When it does work it's great! Unfortunately, that's only half the time.  Sometimes it just refuses to play, even though both the amazon app and my phone say it's connected. Other times it will play a couple of songs and then just stop. I have to go to my phone and press play again to get it going, and it'll only play a few more songs and then stop again.

Followed the instructions and downloaded the Alexa app, but never truly got connected.  All it managed to do was screw up my bluetooth connection.  Finally had to log off and delete the app and fiddle around with my bluetooth in the car in order to get everything back working properly.

"I got an early release version of the Echo Auto and I quite enjoy using it. I have been a long time user of Echo in various versions and it continues to get better and better. Was pretty easy setting it up in my BMW with an iPhone and iDrive and gives me access to all the apps, music, podcasts, audible etc without me having to hunt about on the touchscreen.It’s pretty accurate in terms of voice recognition even with music playing or road noise. I ended up not using the ventilation mount and just putting it, tucked away in the central console. If you use things like Amazon Music or Spotify or other things then this is worth it and the more you use it the more you will get out of it.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"I absolutely LOVE my Echo Auto. My son loves it as well. I find that Alexa is far more responsive than Siri. In fact, I tested this out one day when I was attempting to make a grocery list (while driving). Siri kept getting everything wrong and I had to repeat myself multiple times. I finally got so frustrated and remembered that Alexa could do the same. Alexa put all my items in a list with no problems. She even understands my son, who suffers from a lisp, with all the road noise. He set a reminder, just this AM amidst road and rain noise, for me to clean our fish tank.In terms of playback, I have had no problems. My son is able to get Alexa to play his favorite songs from the back seat. I have yet to utilize the “find cheapest gas” option as the only time I tried, I didn’t have any sort of cell connection. It would be awesome if the Echo Auto was integrated with some sort of wifi that doesn’t require a phone but at the same time, it’s few and far between when I do not have a cell signal. All-in-all, Echo Auto is super awesome. It is super compact and does everything I need.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto is a great device and I love the ability to request my music favorites, make cell phone calls, ask for directions, and get traffic reports and a host of other function all hands free. This device has made my commutes much more entertaining and informative.The only reason I don't give it five stars across the board is that there are occasional connection issues between Echo Auto and your phone which can sometimes be frustrating, but I have noticed that this has become less of a problem since I first received Echo Auto, and I hope with future updates it will continue to improve.",4,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"The thing constantly loses connection. Often just apps responding food no good reason. I often have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to start answering amazon. Usually when it answers it cuts of the first 2 seconds of whatever Alexa is saying. Navigation and other car specific skills are useless. I own 11 echoes and this is the one that is the biggest disappointment. Other more possible is that if you try to play games that required answering questions, like trivia or alexabot chat out doesn't work because of the Bluetooth delay and it bars itself when it is waiting for a response and replies to itself instead of whatever you said. I've tried adjusting whatever limited settings it had, but it just never works right.",2,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Great device if you live alone, BUT, If your better half is at home listening to any of the home echo shows, dots etc. and you are using your echo auto, you will cause the home units to stop functioning.  Originally this did not come up because the only time I used the Echo Auto was when both my wife and I are traveling in the car on trips.  Recently, I've been using the Echo Auto on my bike to listen to amazon music while riding.  Today when I came home I noticed my wife was listening to her favorite station on her laptop.  She told me that our echo devices at home stopped working both today and yesterday, the days I was riding my bike.  I will put the device back in my car and only enable it when we are both in the car.  It's a cool concept and hopefully Amazon will address this flaw",2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"For a 10 year old car this gadget is great. There are some flaws. The bad --> It doesn't read texts sent to you. Sometimes alexa cuts me off when I try to text someone. Sometimes she cancels the text after I get all the way through to the end. The good --> it is fully integrated with spotify. It will read my contacts and send text messages. I can make and receive calls, hands free. It works seamlessly with google maps. The best feature is when I get in my car with my phone, alexa connects automatically and right away, it even makes a noise to tell you it's all connected.  The ugly --> the sound quality is diminished.  My regular blutooth transmitter sounds way better. The cords.... mine sits neatly where all the cords plug in, so it's not too ugly, but people don't hear me well on call unless I'm screaming towards my crotch.",4,1,2019-11-25,1,0,1
"I love it.  Beyond the negatives I’ve seen in other reviews, this device should make my life and travels easier, and has given me no issues worth complaining about.  First off, I’m an Alexa addict.  Inside my home I have one central Echo and three scattered Dots that provide me hands free options house wide, play my music in stereo, and connect my Roomba vacuum and smart plugs and bulbs.  I’m upper middle aged and many of my peers refuse to make their life easier out of ignorance for technology.  I make advancement in home convenience a fun thing.  So...after a short period of fumbling with connecting and activating it, I was excited to see I did good.  I proceeded to make a trip thru my neighborhood and started throwing commands at it.  I asked for directions to a far away city, asked the weather, called my wife, requested music on all my subscriptions (Pandora, Amazon Music, Sirius/XM), asked for a joke, and told Alexa to turn off a lamp in my living room.  I did them all with ease; totally while driving with my hands on the steering wheel.  Because of this, I permanently removed my physical satellite radio from my truck and I will no longer need to use my Honda hands-free calling feature.  Note:  I have unlimited phone data, so this is definitely the main reason this makes using your phone as the Alexa hub, in tandem with the Alexa Auto, such a game changer in every way.  Keep an open mind and enjoy this unnecessary, but cherished piece of tech.  You won’t regret it.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"When I received the invitation for this product I was so excited and couldn't wait to try it. I really wanted to love this but I have been pretty disappointed. When it works right, it is great. However, that is very rare. My car is super quiet and no one else rides with me but I'm constantly having to yell at the device. In order for it to work, it runs through the Alexa app on your phone. This drains my battery!! If you don't have unlimited data, I'm sure it will drain your data usage as well. I also can't get her to read my text messages or notify me of a phone call even though I am blue-toothed to my car. I'm hoping since this is the first one they came out with that it will get better in time.",2,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0

I cannot just say Alexia do etc, I have to touch the icon on my phone to give commands, so much for hand free request. It drops the thread with each phone call I get and I have to start over.

Whoops, forgot to turn off or on lights at home regardless where I am located she obliges.  Thanks Alexa, all chores she willingly does,, keeps me out of traffic, and I actually interact with my Auto Alexa more than the 10 towers and dots, a tap, two shows, two show twos and the show 5 I have in my home.  my Vehicle is older so no built in phone so nice to have Alexa do it for me.

Then a few minutes later it will say ‘sorry, I’m having trouble connecting. When it is safe to do so please open the Alexa app’. Do that and still nothing. Now it won’t connect AT ALL. I’ve disconnected it, removed it from Bluetooth and started over completely and all I can get is an error telling me it can’t connect and asks me to unplug it for 30 seconds. Absolute garbage.

I find myself taking to whatever car I get into, but they never listen to me like Alexa does. I may have to get these for all my cars, no matter how good their Bluetooth is.The Echo Auto can understand me even when the music is loud and the windows are open. The Bluetooth picks up instantly and had good range. I can run Spotify or Pandora through the Echo or from my phone, and Alexa will still skip, pause etc just the same.

Had to power it by plugging into the cigarette power outlet and wound up wit two wires in the unit. It can be a tangled mess. Vent holder does not stay put.

"I live in Pennsylvania, my favorite radio station is in California. Now I can drive to work while listening to it. That's the good news.

My car does not have bluetooth so I see a lot of wires. This is generally no problem but is rather ungainly looking. An unobtrusive device this 'aint!

Also, this I guess is because offer brand new, but the mount it comes with didn't work for my car very well, but I assume some enterprising Chinese company will come up with different style mounts to make it more compatible with other vehicles and better locations.I'm sure Amazon will come with some software update that will fix the ""can't do that"" issue, or I'll figure out how talk to it in a way that it understands better.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

Been using the Echo Auto for about a month now. For the most part I really like it. I’ve had one or two occasions where it didn’t want to connect to the Alexa App but other than that it’s been great for me.  I’m using in a 2010 Equinox that doesn’t have Bluetooth and with the new phone laws it’s been a great hands free device.  You can stream your music from your phone even if the Alexa App isn’t connected but you can’t communicate with Alexa or run your calls through the Echo Auto if it’s not connected.  If your car already has Bluetooth and hands free calling you may not see the advantage of having the Echo Auto unless you just want to talk to Alexa. For me though it’s exactly what I needed and love it.,5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"Works just as well as my Alexa products in the house, but it is annoying that while my phone can automatically connect to my stereo, Echo Auto cannot automatically connect to the app (which I never close and allow background data).  Every time I get in the vehicle I have to open the Alexa app to allow the Echo to connect so it can work.  That is ANNOYING.  I want seamless connectivity.  Many times, my mind is somewhere else and I forget to open the app and then when I need Alexa to do something, I get the dreaded message, ""Echo had lost contact with the Alexa app.  When it is safe to do so, please open the Alexa app.""  At that point, I am already driving down the road and shouldn't be trying to navigate an application to get it to work.

"Yet another device that I have to plug in to the car. Is it worth it? No. My iphone already connects to the car. I already can talk to siri. What do I gain with Alexa? Maybe a better interface but now I have this extra box that it keeps forgetting to connect every time I start the car. It is a bit slow. I guess this is good if you car is not smart at all. But all cars now have bluetooth and my iphone connect immediately. Alexa is slower. Yes it provides better answers that Siri. Yes I like that interfaces with Waze. I love that I can just ask and she answers. But most of the time the voice recognition is terrible.  worst than home version. Yes there is more noise in my car. but Im closer to the device. Will I continue to use it? Maybe for long rides.

"Took a while to get the device connected and operational. You have to use the Alexa app and it was timing out sometimes so I’d have to start the process all over. Happened 4 or 5 times. Then when I finally got it running and connected to my phone’s bluetooth, I realized that I wouldn’t be able to listen to the radio and be able to talk to Alexa at any given point. In order to talk to Alexa, I’d have to leave my car’s (Ford Explorer) bluetooth connection active for audio. Otherwise, I’d have to manually change from radio to bluetooth every time I wasn’t to talk to Alexa. What’s the point of manually changing audio settings and creating a distracted driving situation for having Alexa in my car? Not worth it in my opinion. The other audio option is to connect the auto dot to my car’s auxiliary audio (red & white) connection and I learned that my car doesn’t have that probably because that’s old technology which isn’t installed in newer cars.

"When I first heard about the Echo Auto, I was pretty excited for it - and then I started reading the specs.  Because it uses the car stereo for speakers, in order for it the echo to be completely hands-free, you have to always leave the stereo set to the input it is using - either the aux input, or if your stereo can stream audio from your phone via bluetooth, the Echo Auto will use that (the device bluetooth pairs to your phone, and then works through your phone to get to the car speakers).So if you have a favorite local radio station, or satellite radio, or frequently use an iPod for music in your car, the Echo Auto will not exactly seamlessly integrate with your listening habits.

Also, when you hook it to your vent, then you can't move your vent, so make sure you know where you want your vent to blow air for your eight hour trip :)  They could have made a much better design if they had turned the vent thing upside down.I've gone back to using my phone on bluetooth and asking Google.

After a few weeks of using Alexa Auto I can tell you that you can live without this but it does make life easier.  The biggest plus to me a single dad of 3 is being able to add to the shopping list while I’m driving.  Second best feature is the ease of use for music selecting.  My kids can change the song when they want instead of bothering me for my phone or asking me to change it.  Third best feature is getting the weather or setting alarms by voice.  I can also call my children’s echo in their room from my car and vice versa.The look:,4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"My new passion is audiobooks and the commute to and from various places gives me plenty of time to listen. I used to listen exclusively to Fox news while driving, but no matter your politics of preference, I have concluded it's the same stuff day after day after day. The new Echo Auto lets me listen to audio books, or check the weather, or order meals, all hands free. I can drop in on any Alexa device I have, call anyone seamlessly, all without having  to touch a single button or ever let my eyes leave the road. It works. The only flaw thus far is that rarely when I stop briefly for say 10 minutes, then resume travel, the BT connection is lost. Doesn't happen often. I'm sure that's a software update coming down the pike. Highly recommended.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"I expected it to work just like my echo dot when I got it a few months ago. It took some time setting up, the customer service was helpful there. After using it for several months now I would say that it’s definitely not as great as echo dot or any at home Alexa product. It’s good for music- plays what you command it to, after a few seconds. It can answer questions after a few seconds time lag. The problem is the time delay and inability to understand your answers when playing word games or any question answer games. It just keeps messing up. My kids and I were excited that we’ll have the ability to play all those games on long drives, but we gave up playing any of the games soon, it was just too frustrating repeating answers 10 times. Now it’s used just for music or when we have a question which we think Alexa will have answer to.",3,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"To be honest, I like the concept behind the echo auto, but there is a lot left to be desired. It does start up quickly, but at times it doesn’t pair properly (I pair with an iPhone 7+.. maybe if you have a newer phone you don’t have that issue) and it pairs well with my Toyota Corolla. The microphones do work very well and it enhances the ability of others being able to hear me better with the windows open when I make a call. There are a couple issues I have with this product.. 1. In order for this to be useful In relation to directions, Alexa (and Amazon) needs access to your location on your phone all the time.. and it’s grabbing your location quite frequently (not just when you ask Alexa for directions or anything where it actually needs your location).. yeah no thanks Amazon. 2. The Product says it can’t connect to my phone from time to time.. or it asks me to relaunch Alexa.. or that it can’t connect to Spotify when I ask it to do that. I recognize that this may be caused by limitations that Apple has placed on the application, but these restrictions effectively make this product useless and frustrating when it occurs.. Being that it’s in a car, it’s not exactly convenient to take your eyes off of the road to reset Alexa or launch an app on your phone.. that’s why you have this product in the first place, right? In any event, when it does work, it works very well. You can control devices connected to Alexa and have it make calls for you from wherever you are, which is neat. Amazon, you have a long way to go with this one. It’s a good first hack, but wait until they iron out the kinks and this could be a great product.",3,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"This is basically an Alexa for the car but in my opinion it should have more handsfree features. I can't add reminders, reminders that once I leave the car would transfer to my phone Alexa app or echo device of my choice, can't make phone calls, can't start navigation, just off the top of my head. I guess a good first release.While I'm on the subject of Alexa. (SOAP BOX) Isn't this whole smart stuff concept supposed to make things easier?  Do I really need to know who is doing what. ""Alexa set the living room to 76 degrees"" ""Okay. I'll let ecobee know to set the living room to 76 degrees"". I mean really. How about  ""your command has been executed of powerful one"".

"I do love the addition to my car!! I've often been tempted to shout out ""Alexa..."" what's the weather? Play this song? Whatever the request might be while driving and was so thrilled to finally be able to do this!! So love having it in my car!!But... it seemed like it would randomly disconnect and I'd have to take multiple steps to reconnect it to my phone and the car which made it very not ""hands-free"" the way I had hoped. And then there is the fact that very shortly after getting this they added the call out to Alexa feature on my phone. So being that I needed to connect my phone to the device for internet connection anyway it became unnecessary to have the device at all as I connect the phone directly to my car and can call out commands to my phone now. Right up until they added that feature I felt it was essential but at this point my phone does everything this device does but holds the connection to my car better!",4,1,2019-10-14,1,1,0
"We really like this for the car. It connects very quickly when the car is turned on (much quicker than my phone bluetooth to the speakers), and acts like any other Alexa (good and bad).  Very quickly and easily pulls up music we want to hear, temperature, weather, etc.  Very good sound and bass over my car speakers.  It disconnects now and again mainly due to areas of limited cell signal, but that seems like more of a fault of the carrier.  Didn't know how much I really liked it and depended on it until my phone wouldn't connect to my car speakers and I couldn't use the Alexa with great sound as intended. Then I really missed it. Weird to say I know, but it's honestly like a buddy in my car.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
for the most part we love it. we listen to what we want to hear- whenever we want to hear it.works with my home set up... I can tell it to turn my lights inside my house on so I dont have to walk,4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
Works like any other Amazon Alexa device.  When you make or get a call the device light turns solid green and passes your voice through it.  I turned on the mute button and the light went red but my callers could also no longer hear me.  For my car the only way you could use Alexa was to put radio to Bluetooth mode.  That means if I was listening to the radio I could not hear Alexa reply to me.  She heard me but because the audio came back on my Bluetooth  I could not hear her.  When I get a call my radio shuts off and Bluetooth turns on and I can hear caller.  If you ask Alexa something it does not turn on my Bluetooth automatically- might just be my car.  Other issue is it uses your phone to connect to internet but if you play music it leaves a widget open on your lock screen (Apple iOS 12.) No biggie other than you can’t get rid of it easily and it does not allow Alexa to pick up where you left off 90% or more to continue playing what’s on the screen.,3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I found set up to be fairly easy and its voice recognition is really good. Not perfect, but a big upgrade over using just my phone's ""Ok Google"".  It does have some problems though.1) Navigation is bad for anything small scale or local. If I want a big store or restaurant, no problem. Anything small scale or locale it doesn't know.

"I really wanted to like this. And I do. When it's working. But it rarely does. I have a 2011 Chevy Traverse and at first I didn't have issues or I wasn't using it much that I noticed. I liked that I could use it for the phone and music. My car Bluetooth will only do calling and no music. However, I'm tired of the constant issues. It's constantly telling me that Alexa has lost it's connection and I need to go to the app to connect. I still haven't found the place in the app where I need to connect. I disconnect the power to try to get it to connect again. Over and over and over again. The rest of the time Alexa just doesn't respond, I get the beep when I say Alexa and then nothing. Over and over and over again. It's really not worth the $50 so I am glad that I only paid the $25 introductory. Really only worth $10 or $15 with all the issues and frustration that it's caused.",1,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0

"Not a great product.  I had high Hope's for having Alexa in our cat, but this maybe works 15% of the time. It's best use is as a handsfree bluetooth speaker for calls if your car does not have built in bluetooth.  The system also can't seem to handle a two user situation. One where both drivers have the app & device installed. It won't connect to either. Alexa never answers right & doesn't seem to sync with our one account.

As soon as I turn off my vehicle and then get back in and start my vehicle, the Echo Auto will not automatically connect again. It forces me to go through the setup procedure every time like I was setting up a new device. I am sorry that I am past the return date on this or it would go back.

"Unlike many of the other reviews I had no issues with getting Alexa Auto connected. For what it is I am happy. A novelty maybe at the moment but I do expect she will get better. The auto is yet unable to do all the functions the echo can do but it is handy to check weather, get locations and general questions while driving. Or play you Amazon music library by voice. My only real complaint is that in my car I have to switch the source so I can hear her. I keep my audio normally on Sirius but have to switch to my phone connection/bluetooth on my dashboard screen so hear her. Minor complaint..Overall if you understand she is like a baby echo that still needs to learn I think you will enjoy owning this.

"As much as you may love Alexa... this is not her... this is her crabby sister who has little ambition in life and refuses to get her crap together... this product Will take your love for Alexa and flush it right down the toilet. First annoying thing is that this device is not battery powered. What is so great about having a Bluetooth hands-free device in the car if you have to constantly have wires sprawled out everywhere? But hey… I’m sure some people are perfectly OK with that so I’ll move on to issue number two... there are an awful lot of things that a normal echo dot can do/answer that this one cannot do. You can ask her some of your routine questions and the response you will get is “I’m not able to perform that function, why don’t you ask my perfect adorable sister... blah blah” I was cruising down the road and asked her to tell me about some popular skills and she suggested one where Samuel L Jackson response instead of her. She asked me if I would like to install the skill. I said yes. She told me I was cruising down the road and asked her to tell me about some popular skills and she suggested one where Samuel L Jackson responds instead of her. She asked me if I would like to install the skill. I said yes. She told me The correct way to ask a question in order to activate that skill. I did just that... since it was my first time asking I received a polite little caution about profanity before continuing… Then right as it was about to answer my question she chimes in and lets me know that only her honor roll sister can do that..don’t count on navigation… She doesn’t navigate she relies on your phone apps and requires you to interact with your phone in order to use them which takes the “free” out of hands-free...",1,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0

"My husband read reviews and tried to discourage me from buying Alexa Auto - but we have 3 Dots, 2 Spots and an Echo in our house and I missed the Alexa functionality during my commute, so I bought the Alexa Auto anyway. So far, the only thing that she does somewhat smoothly is make a call, and I could already do that through my car's original Carplay feature. (Note my car is a 2013 so the Carplay function is pretty minimal).Since the Alexa Auto requires connection through the Bluetooth connection of my car, she isn't responsive unless I have the input switched to Media, which means that she can't work while I have the radio on. She is slow to respond and often doesn't respond - it she isn't sure about what I've asked (?), which is frustrating. I'm also having some problems disconnecting her from my phone/watch, which will show that Alexa is ""playing"" even when the car is turned off and I'm at my desk.",2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"So I really wanted to like this product but the integration is poor. I would not have paid any more than the $25 that I did for this item. Luckily I was able to get it for the lower pricing. Nonetheless, it's useful for being able to get in the car and allow my daughter the freedom to choose songs to listen to instead of distracting me as a driver when we're on the road. It is a little annoying though having to hear her scream ""Alexa's"" name a million times before she can even say her request. I've noticed also how the echo randomly disconnects and wants you to open the Alexa app to get it set up again when it's safe to do so....ummmm, the point of the echo is to utilize it while driving, not experiencing issues while in route.",2,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

Instructions are minimally useless.  After an hour or so I was finally able to get the phone connected to the Echo, and the Echo connected to the car...  So then the big reveal..  I ask Alexa where the nearest Home Depot is, as that is where I was headed...just trying to see how well it worked....CRICKETS!  the little ""Im busy"" light swirled away at the center of the phone for 10 minutes, and wouldnt stop without me backing out of the app.  Next I tried playing some music off of one of  my Amazon Music playlists.  After a few minutes the playlist showed all the music on the list, and said it was playing the first song...  Nothing playing in my car.  After trying to figure this out, it seems the Echo is auto defaulting to play the stuff out of the Amazon Fire I have connected to my home stereo, and I cannot change it.

The sound quality is linked through my phone to my car's speakers via bluetooth, so the quality is only as good as my speaker system. The tiny speaker on the device itself which tells me when it has lost its connection should never be your only speaker, so it's fine. I've tried this is my bluetooth enabled entertainment system, and in a car without one, linking via the aux cable. For older cars without a bluetooth enabled entertainment system, this is an excellent work around.The only item that failed to live up to my expectation is the vent holder for the Auto.

When this finally became available, I bought it.  Unfortunately, the only feature it added to what my new car can already do, is to add items to my Alexa shopping list!  It's unneeded in today's new cars; so I have removed it.  It will be going to a grandchild who is driving an older car, and can use the added features that the Echo Auto provides.

They walked me through several ""fixes"" and yet, the same issues.  They then passed my problem up the ladder, and I was contacted again.  After all of this it came to be that it was most likely defective.  They replaced it and I sent the defective one back.  With the replacement, it connected much quicker and didn't give me the frustration I was having before.  Is it completely no hassels?  No, there are times still that it won't respond or connect..but not like before.  At least with the replacement I'm able to work through it easier.ORIGINAL REVIEW.. I bought this echo auto through the invitation.  It took awhile for it connect in my Ram truck.  Once connected, it took several verbal attempts to get it to do anything.  If you shut your vehicle off, guess what, you start the hassle of the connection problem all over again.  I end up yelling at this piece of plastic because it gets so frustrating. After you return home, and are safely in your home, then you have to force stop the Alexa app or else it's still running on your phone.  Have to say, the basic idea of it is good but the execution of it is poor.  Maybe this first release is the test project and the future ones will have more bugs worked out?

"So I was very excited when after almost a year of waiting, I was finally invited to purchase one of these. Set it up in my car and did a quick drive to the corner market, it played music, it called my wife, everything worked GREAT. Drove back home and was able to turn the lights on in my living room before getting out of the car. However, after the first day the thing would never connect to my phone, so I could never use it. After multiple resets, deleting and reinstalling the app and more troubleshooting, I was able to get it to connect, played some music, then next trip in the car it wouldn't connect at all. I couldn't go through that on a daily basis so I returned it. If you want a product that will maybe work once, this is perfect for you, but if you want consistency, DONT BUY THIS!!!",1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"At first, I thought this was an amazing product.  It responded to voice commands such as playing music and making phone calls.  Now, not only do I have to yell for it to hear me, it no longer responds correctly to my requests - if it responds at all.  Usually I hear a chime after saying ""Alexa,"" I make my request, then there's another chime.  Nothing happens.  When it worked well, I was so happy.  Now it doesn't connect no matter how many times I unplug it, reset it, and resync it with my phone.  Note:  all of these steps must be done when you are parked and not driving.  Here's hoping for improvement in an updated device.",3,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
"My car only has Bluetooth for making calls. Echo auto allows me to use my Auxiliary to connect to my car speakers. Now I can connect my phone via Bluetooth to Echo auto and listen to anything through my car speakers. I also like that I can give commands to Alexa without taking my eyes off the road.  Every time I turn on the car, Alexa is ready for my commands.  I highly recommend it, if you have limited or no Bluetooth connection in your car.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,1,0
"I think the big appeal would be the ease of use, making connecting your car to Alexa seamless. I agree. And *when* it works it's great. However....the *when* is the biggest issue. It relies on WiFi/Wireless and Bluetooth.  So, until you drive out out wireless range of work or home, she'll give you a hard time. If that isn't the hard time she's giving you, it's the Bluetooth connection.I wanted to like this, heck, I wanted to love it, but instead I've spent more time telling Alexa what I thought or her instead of enjoying my music or books.",3,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like this product.  I have an older Infotainment system in my car that does not have voice input.  I was looking forward to voice dialing and navigation as well as the many Alexa ecosystem functions.  When the product works, it's pretty good-not great-but good enough.  The problem is that at least 50% of the time I try to use it the Echo Auto has lost communication to my Pioneer Infotainment.  I have even tried direct audio and it is still buggy.  The interplay of Bluetooth between Pioneer, Phone and echo I can understand being troublesome, but with wired audio is is still too much hassle.  More disappointed in this product than any other Amazon purchase.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Its a trip (or if you are on a trip) its hard not to like having your iphone integrated and available through the Alexa interface. I have an old Ford Ranger with a new Sony Radio with bluetooth and the addition of the Alexa Auto gives me access in ways you only find in the newest vehicles.  On the other hand, the device is intrusive and ungainly with the required power cord getting in the way no matter how you try and set it up.  The a/c vent mount was a good try but gets only a B minus even on today's liberal grading standard.  It doesn't stay put and definitely blocks the vent. It won't work at all in a new Toyota Tacoma and there are no other options provided.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I've been using the Echo Auto for almost 5 months but I never really used it until I took a long road trip.  Going to and from work I found myself listening to the regular radio but it was great having a hands-free opportunity to switch over to the Echo Auto when I wanted to miss commercials or stream a specific song.  Unfortunately, that is the largest drawback of the device.  Unless you only use Bluetooth or the auxiliary in and dedicate your radio to this device, you need to switch to this device when you want to ask question, play a song, or use any of the Echo's features.  My father-in-law bought one and that was the most confusing part to him.  He has his phone paired with his car and phone calls interrupt the radio but Alexa doesn't and his first question is ""Why doesn't it work like my phone?"".  Having to switch over to this device in order to easily interact with it is by far the largest drawback.Now, what is this device good for?  After driving 12+ hours in a day, this is great for keeping the music going that I want to listen to.  Sure, I could buy a satellite radio subscription but I'm already paying for ""unlimited"" data for my phone so this allows me to utilize that data and do it hands free.  For $30 - $40, this works for me.",3,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"The setup was simple.  It integrates very well with my iPhone. It allows me to access my audio library and make phone calls hands free while driving.  The sound quality is as good as my car's audio.  My only problem is that I really do have an OLD car that does not have a way to hook to Bluetooth or to input the output plug. That means I need to use a really old tape adapter that plugs (perfectly) into the Echo.  The problem is actually that tape adapter squeaks.  It's not a problem with the Echo, it's just a problem.I would not have an echo in my home for privacy reasons. But when I'm driving on my own, which I do all the time, this is a great solution for the car.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"I have a 2009 Honda Odyssey van that is low tech but it DOES have an aux input.  I was using an Echo Input, which was fine, but I had to remember to turn on my hotspot each time.  The Auto utilizes Bluetooth so it's automatic.  I do have a few issues with it hearing me over road noise, but not enough to get me to ditch it by any means.  The sound quality is excellent.  Great for shuffling my playlists or picking up where I left off on a podcast.  Hands-free calling works very well.  Was getting a bit of echoing from the Input model, but have been told this is much much better from those on the other end of my calls.  Bought on sale...money very well spent.",4,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I received my Echo Auto yesterday and immediately installed it in my F350 truck.  It guided me through the process of installation and connecting to my phone.  I don't know how it does what it does but it integrated seamlessly with my stereo system.  I have had trouble remembering the hands free commands for my truck but that is all solved now because I am already familiar with Alexa commands because echo units are all over my house.  My initial impression is very pleased with the purchase.  I had purchased two, the second for my service vehicle. I was impressed enough with it that I just ordered a third Echo Auto for my wife's car.  If you have mastered Alexa commands you will want one of these for your vehicle(s).",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Had I not been one of the earlier participants to receive this, I probably wouldn’t have bought it just based on the reviews.

"Doesn’t work with Spotify, which it is ADVERTISED to be compatible with and which is the only music streaming service i use. I only bought this product because I missed the convenience of my home echo when I was on the road, and because I thought it would be a lot safer than trying to find a specific song or artist on Spotify while driving. Lo and behold not only does this not work with Spotify, but the amazon development team has been aware of this issue for at LEAST 10 months (see: Amazon forums) and has yet to either fix the issue or redact their claims that Echo Auto works with Spotify.If you use Amazon music, this is the device for you. No problems with playing Amazon music. But I refuse to switch to an inferior streaming service simply because it’s the only one Amazon made sure actually works for this device.",1,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"For about a week I have tried several times getting Alexa to respond to requests with Unable to connect to the phone,Not finding a network.

I will start off by saying I had (4) primary uses for hands free Alexa use when I bought this Echo:1) Looking for directions & ETA,2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"The echo seems to only cause me two issues. One of which I may have figured out for now. 1.) My driveway is on the same side of the property of my living room. So when I am in my living room on my phone the echo in my car connects to my phone which is a pain in the butt because when my phone rings and I try to answer it, it's connected to my car. I could turn blue tooth off on my phone but then my fit bit won't work properly and I can't connect to other devices in my house. That brings me to problem 2.) If I unplug the Alexa in my car (my cigarette lighter stays on when the car is off) then I have to reset it up every time I get in my car which is a pain. But when the Alexa is working and in my car while I'm driving I love it! It plays all the music I want and does all the commands I want. I can even make announcements to my home Alexa's like ""I'll be home in 5 mins"" or I can drop in and have basically a phone call to ask if we need before I arrive home.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Alexa auto has been a game changer for me. I travel a lot mostly driving and my car was full of different devices for hands free, plus music, plus controls. With Alexa auto I can occupy my time driving while still scheduling tasks and making notes, phone calls don’t require a separate device. I also like that I can take it with me if I fly and get a rental car. I have even used the “Talk to me” skill to converse with an AI when bored while driving. I can see many more uses that will no doubt be enabled by future development to support user experiences while driving safely. Like tracking eta, driving distances, special vehicle alerts.

I get weather reports, drive time estimates, just started using traffic reports, my todo list, my calendar, email summaries, incoming text messages read.  It is great.  All of these things can be done with out taking my hands off the steering wheel or my eyes off the road.  I bought them for every driver in my immediate family",3,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
Boohoo. We love Echo and all things Alexa but this product is not ready for prime time.  It has problems when there is more than one iPhone in the car and usually just disconnects. Works fairly well if just one iPhone in car. The location function forgot where home is and didn’t work properly either. I didn’t care for the air vent mount. It was wobbly. I think some sort of magnetic mount would be more stable. We had to return this item. We are hoping they perfect these issues in the future as we do love the concept of Echo Mobile.,1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"This device loses connection all the time. Also very intrusive. Could not mount on my Chevy Trax. After repeatedly setting it up, got tired and put it away.

My state just passed a ""hands free"" law (which is good!) and Alexa Auto ensures that I stay safe and that definitely makes this a valuable product.But, as with an technology, it isn't perfect yet. Just like the Dot, it will continue to get better but for now there are times that I use the wake word, the device makes a noise to alert that it is listening, and then I give a command but it doesn't respond. Also, sometimes I have to manually start music on my Amazon Music app before the device will respond to music specific commands. Minor nuisances that become especially annoying when you have a passenger and you're repeating yourself like mad person, but honestly, it's just par for the course.",4,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I have tried both the Garmin and the Muse bluetooth devices with ""Alexa"". Neither worked at all with my phone and could never actually talk to the internet. When it did (rarely) it was painfully slow. The Echo Auto works just like the Echo in my kitchen. Response is fast, bluetooth connects seamlessly and automatically when I get in car, and Alexa requests are pretty darn fast. I use it a lot for Spotify and the usual ""put xyz on the shopping list"" stuff. You do have to have the App running on your phone, but I've learned not to swipe it off, and almost never have to think about it in the car - just ask Alexa and go! I haven't figured out how to tell it to play songs that are downloaded natively on the phone itself, but it integrates well with Spotify. My car is old, so I use the Aux cord and there was a bit of a headache getting the cords plugged in without stringing through the whole front cabin. As it is, I don't use the vent holder at all and it sometimes doesn't hear my requests unless I turn my head down (where it's resting between the front seats). Especially since I tried the other devices, I wanted to say how good the ""real"" Echo Auto is!",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"Not much. The first one didn't work so I was sent another one. I had difficulty in coordinating my Mercedes Bluetooth with my iPhone and the echoauto. I think you have to have your phone and Internet availability in your car. There wasn't a clear explanation that when the device is ready, the screen in my car indicates that the device is ""paused."" After installation there have been a number of disconnects requiring a reinstallation of the device--a cumbersome process. And then all I have to do is turn a couple of dials on my radio to accomplish the same thing. To make this device sufficiently valuable to go through this process, Amazon will have to add a number of new features.",2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0

I am soooooo in love with it. No messing with radio to find a station you like, just ask alexa for exactly what you want to listen to.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
Needs some work still. I wasnt thrilled after getting it. It uses your phones connection to work. And not just the internet data connection it needs the Alexa app on your phone to properly work. So technically its a extension of the phone app is all. Not that great expecially if your phone is slow. I have a LG V30 and ita not the fastest. I was hoping for a phone just to connect Alexa to the internet only. App not needed. Other then that it works good for Spotify and everything else that works on your phone already.,3,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"Having several hands free apps/actions on my phone the echo seemed unnecessary- I didn’t really get what it was supposed to add that I don’t already have with my phone Alexa and Siri. Bluetooth didn’t work with my car (Honda odyssey) which I knew before buying so I had to use aux connection. Holding on to it anyways for when my daughter gets her car coming up soon that doesn’t have Bluetooth etc. maybe she’ll find more use for it as she doesn’t have as many features and functions already available on her phoneMajor issue also was just getting the darn thing to connect and keep the connection. Spent 2 hours trying to get it connected and finally got it but lost it quickly and didn’t want to go through all that again.

"My husband has a 2005 car that does not have bluetooth and he says the Echo Auto is more useful for him in his car. Nothing is hands free without Alexa. He has no buttons on his car for carplay to skip a song even. If you have an older car you will love this and can ignore the following complaints from someone who is spoiled with car play. He loves it do not second guess it and if you hate it, send it back within a month (or take it into kohls amazon return packaging center where they will pack and send it for you) amazon is great.It works great if you have one for each person. The trouble connecting between the cellphones is something that needs to be worked on. You cannot just connect to the Echo via Bluetooth in your phone settings and it works like every other device. If you are driving your spouses' car your phone will not connect easily or seamlessly to the Echo. It is just much easier to have one per person. That way it is plug in and play, not plug - pretty much reset from the beginning and then wait for it to load then - play. I have an hour and a half commute to school and a 45 min commute to work and Siri and I do not get along, she never listens to me. Echo Auto I would give an 8/10 for listening to me. I can easily take notes, continue my audiobook automatically or ""rewind my audiobook 3 min"" because after 8 hours of work when an audiobook restarts mid-sentence or paragraph it can be confusing, change my playlist and set reminders all hands free. It needs work but it is by far better than any option that is currently available.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"So i read all the review and just assumed that i would be better than most these people. I figured i could get mine to work better and i would love this product as i love all my other Alexa devices. I was sadly wrong. The whole experience just feels clunky. The wires running all around my car. When i had A/C running in my car or i was on the highway, or any other times where the noise was a little louder Alexa had trouble hearing me. When it would hear me, a lot of the time it would still ask me to use my phone to do things. Like if i asked for directions half the time it would ask me to open the app before continuing.  I really really wanted to be the exception and i wanted to like this echo auto so bad but it just inst that great. 2/5 stars.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
It’s not a bad idea. I got mine with the pre-order. Only spent $25. I don’t know if I would pay more than that for it.I just wish there was a better way to mount it that didn’t flop to floor when my kids reach for it. And the cords can get a bit annoying.,3,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0

Setup was simple if you have any working knowledge of electronics and previous Alexa setup experience.Then the bad. If you have read any of the reviews of this product you will notice a common theme. The constant disconnect and process to reconnect your Echo Auto. If Amazon can get this figured out in some sort of OTA update the Echo Auto has some real potential.

Also, at least for my truck (infiniti JX35) when connecting it to my phone and truck, sometimes it has bad call quality; others complain they hear an echo and I have to use my earpiece. Thats sucks.

I got my device during the invite. I've really enjoyed this device. My car only connects to my phone to make calls so I was looking for a BT audio device. I've purchased a few but none of them hive me the audio quality and volume like this. It does have some quirks. The Alexa app definitely needs more work for all devices. The device itself needs better understanding of commands. Sometimes it gives me the wrong information or plays the wrong song. I also do not like that if I play Amazon music by voice  it leaves the information in my notification drop down once I've stopped using it. It doesnt do it when I go to the app to play music and close the app.,4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0

So, not sure why. Same with my RAV-R. Now, what I did discover is that you can put this device on your console, not necessary to attach to  your car's vents, and it will recognize it with no problem So that awkward vent attachment with wires leading to your power outlet is eliminated. On my RAV i need the power cord AND the single wire for connecting to the AUX outlet, so no Bluetooth, again no problem. Otherwise so far so good.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

This is not an ""invitation only"" deal, this is nothing but a beta test we had to pay for.

My Echo Auto, like so many others, will just be used as a Bluetooth pass-through for my iPhone while I use SIRI to actually accomplish what I want.

I feel that Echo Auto serves for the most part what it set out to do.  However I found that for me personally it just is lacking in key areas for me to use daily.  The largest downfall for me is the lack of Apple Carplay compatibility.  I have my phone hooked up to that all the time while driving.  I found that Echo Auto would be spotty while this was active.  Sometimes it would override the audio others it wouldn't.  If I could use Echo Auto to navigate the CarPlay apps and automatically pull up directions via Waze we would be in business.Now if you don't use carplay or have an older vehicle that is lacking some of the newer tech features this is probably a life saver.  This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5.  While it didn't serve my needs it does do what it claims to do well.,4,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

No option to save password, and it averages 7 minutes to get the Alexa Auto to function.  Today, I thought I would give it another try... I'm done with Alexa Auto.

Also, I've tried a few different commands to have it hang up but so far I'm having a hard time doing so.  It does, though, have some wonderful features.  The sound quality is great.

Driving directions are hilariously broken and calls fail before they even start. Most of the time with Alexa letting me know that she ""Can't do that right now"" after confirming the person's name to call for the 3rd time. Only dialing by manually telling her each number works consistently.  The device picks up my commands about 50% of the time and only mutes around 20% of the volume of what you're listening to, forcing the drive to manually turn down their music to issue commands.

In addition, even though Alexa turns on immediately when you start the car, it could take several minuted to get ready to respond...not sure if its an issue with linking to the Bluetooth in the car or with your Alexa app. If you want Navigation, its much more reliable just going to Google Maps or Waze then through Alexa. So what is this good for? Its a novelty right now...not bad if you want to hear a ""Jimmy Fallon""  joke...but that gets  tiresome after a while....""Take it away, Jimmy""",2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I paired this with a 2016 Acura ILX. I wouldn't recommend this by a long shot.  Pairing is a real pain to deal with as the app (on iOS iPhone X) will not see it on first attempt unless you fiddle with Bluetooth settings.  I'm not entirely sure why the app could not just let the BT pairing be done in iOS settings which does a WAY better job in BT pairing.and once I have it paired, it only works half the time, and would only work again once i unplug/re-plug to its USB power source.  That is the deal-breaker for me.  I can look past the cumbersome setup, but if it doesn't work when you expect it to, then its core functionality has failed.",1,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I got this so I could drop my overpaid XM/Sirius radio subscription. I was pleased at the quality and size of the device.  The vent mount would be nice if it fit my vent (2016 Chevy Volt) but it just falls out, and honestly blocks the airflow.  I made a dash mount out of it and the device works just fine.I am loving the sound quality ( I have Bose speakers in my car) and the device turns on when I get back in the car.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I love this thing! It’s not perfect, and the navigation needs MUCH work, but it makes me happy! I NEED to continue my “Lists” and “Reminders” in the car, this accomplishes that for me. It calls my favorite people quickly and efficiently. Allows me to listen to most major TV all-news channels, get weather, play whatever songs I’m in the mood for :-) Considering my car lacks CarPlay, this is the best alternative I’ve found. If I paid the new full price, boy would I not be nearly as satisfied. They should NOT be charging current price for this “not so ready for Prime Time” device. Again, my review, my happiness with the Echo for Auto is based upon MY purchase price, which was drastically lower than what it’s listed at now. Will Amazon print this review with my honest remarks?

"Looked forward to adding this to my 4x4 that does not have built in bluetooth.  I was not able to, so will try passing it on.  Did not realize that it required a constant power supply, a stereo input jack or BT (do not have either in vehicle), and the Alexa app must remain open severely draining power.  Since the echo would be using the power cable you would have no way to power your phone especially as it drains a great deal of power if using maps along with the echo.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"Honestly,... alexa is stupid compared to google assistant. I consistently get hung up with verbal recognition or the need to add an app just to get incorrect directions.  When I can just activate my phone and ask a question or give instructions. alexa can't call anyone not in your linked contact list.  so if you say to alexa "" alexa, call the police department in NYC""  you get ""sorry, I'm not sure about that""  say the same thing to your android phone anf you get a list of different numbers.I've become so frustrated with alexa auto i've almost thrown it out the window twice.

"I bought this for me and my husband because I wanted the convenience of Alexa and voice control access to my Amazon music/playlists while on the go. Also, the less time we spend fumbling with our phones in the car the better. I liked the ease of setup and that I can send text messages (my 2017 Toyota Tundra's ""assistant"" seems to only work 75% of the time). It works off your phone and comes with a simple attachment for your air vent. The instructions show pictures of the compatible types of vents (mine were not), so for now I have it sitting on my center console; I'll figure something out. I only have a seven minute commute to work and haven't experienced any connectivity issues; my husband has a longer commute and said he gets a ""connection was lost"" message several times during his drive. I believe this is because we use Xfinity mobile, which jumps from one wifi hot spot to the next (when avail) before before relying on cell towers. I bet if he turned off his wifi it would work just fine. If I find this not to be the case, I'll update my post.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

One main issue I have is when I first startup my car and start to leave, I'll try to have Alexa open spotify, but she is unable to connect because my phone is leaving wifi(bad signal since leaving the house), then my phone tries to connect and Alexa can't connect. Once im fat enough I can try again and sometimes it won't play until I pull out my phone and open spotify...  other times I'll try to answer my phone from Alexa and she doesn't answer.  Maybe I'm using incorrect phrase? (Alexa answer,  Alexa answer phone, Alexa accept). Once again  I need to pull out my phone. I will say, the one time I used it for directions it was very helpful and got me to where I need.

It'll play through the echo and onto my sound system in my car, but voice commands don't work anymore and if I say ""Alexa"" the light comes on with no sound cue and never goes off. I'm just amazed this happens. I don't wanna pay to replace it though. Not worth it.When she works, it's great.

Sure it just brings your phone's Alexa to your car's Audio system but it does so when the key is turned and here's a bonus: maps and other apps now sync without the need of wires. Brilliant.

""Open the garage door"".  You guessed it, not compatible.  All that said, I think this is a step backward from the Echo Dot that it replaced in my car.

"I use a very limited set of features on this device so I'll limit my review to those. My car does not have bluetooth audio streaming and all other adapters I had found required you to power on the unit before it could be used. I don't want to see or touch the unit. The Echo Auto powers on and connects to my iPhone when the car powers on, effectively giving me bluetooth streaming with zero input every time I get in the car. This is all I wanted and it does it well.Setup was honestly a breeze however I did have some difficulty resetting it and pairing it with a new phone but eventually it worked. Randomly it just doesn't play music even though it shows as connected and my phone says its playing music on that device. If its a short drive I switch to XM or enjoy the sounds of nature; longer drives I just power cycle the unit and it works.

I tried playing a favorite Prime music list, which quickly ran down my phone's monthly data quota. I tried adding items to my shopping list and it misunderstood most of the item names (like ""tissues"" became ""tampons"" which was REALLY weird and unsettling while sitting in traffic!). I asked for directions about six times and every time Alexa said ""I don't know that."" I tried a few other basic questions such as ""Alexa, will it rain today?"" and it answered ""I don't know that."" I finally unplugged it. It's useless.

They worked sporadically with our previous Iphone 8’s, but even that was hit and miss. When it did work, it would mess with my apple car play, rendering that useless, so I could only use one or the other. So NOT worth the constant hassle. They released it to market before it was ready.

When it is working properly, Alexa is seamless and understands my commands even when I'm on the highway with the doors off on my older jeep wrangler.

I have multiple Echo devices in my house, so I thought this would be a good solution.Alexa has not worked well with my car.  From the mounting clamps not fitting the air vents, to it not working with the connection port it took considerable time to find a way for the connection to work.

Initially the set up would quit in the middle and when it would complete, Alexa wouldn’t listen to me. She would respond and shut off before I got a word in. Extremely frustrating. I spoke with customer service and they stated this was a common issue so..I assumed it would be fixed. Fast forward two weeks, Alexa got an update and finally will listen to me for more than a second...the first time. Now every time I get in the car, she reminds me she can’t connect to my phone HOWEVER I can play Spotify music to the Auto if I manually change the output on the Spotify app.LASTLY, when I asked for directions it wanted me to use Apple maps, which I removed the movement I bought my phone.",1,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0

Only giving 3 stars due to the bulky vent mount.  I ordered one of these pre-order and it came with a super nice sticky pad with a square magnet to place anywhere you want in your car.  Obviously directions say on dash or on vent but I put mine on middle console down leg level sitting and it works flawless.  I was able to do this with the nice sticky pad mount which I'm being told out of stock and not sure if or when they will get again.As for the device itself it's slick .

OK...back to the car...I was able to use Alexa voice commands to access my iPhone's music playlists, check the weather, etc.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I would advocate for a completely wireless experience - have it featured with a rechargeable battery.

The rubber cord holder is only held on with adhesive and with 2 cords in them came off in less than a week. Its a nice way to make an older radio Bluetooth capable.

"I received this as a Christmas gift and was skeptical of how I would use it.  I have a truck with all the bells.  It has voice recognition, built in texting and calling, Satellite radio.  So, how could I use Alexa in it when I had all I needed.  My wife got a new car with all the bells too, so no go there.  Her older car was before all the new gadgets, so I decided to try it in that one.  The older car has no blue tooth or anything like that, but has an auxiliary port.  It snapped to my vent without issues and the nice attachment comes with slots on the front to hold the wires.  This is nice, but still, you have to have power and auxiliary wire.  How does she work?  Voice recognition is great no matter how loud the interior is.  Even going down the freeway with windows open, she can still hear you.  But, what makes this thing really great is that she can play my Sirius Radio straight from my phone.  Now I have satellite radio on this older car.  She allows me to have the same hands free voice and phone calling that I do with my truck.  Now, this little car can do what my truck can and more.  I have many lights and devices controlled by my home Alexa, but now I can control them while on the road.  I can turn on my living room lights before I even get up to the door.  I can now even play word games while I drive along.  This is better than my truck, so now I do not mind driving the little car around town.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, for the most part.  I have not tried her in my truck, but I would think things would get confusing trying to keep tracked of who I need to talk to, Alexa or Truck.  In the older car without all those bells, oh yea.

"This thing is terrible. I love the idea. I hate the integration. I had so many problems getting the unit set up, the adding contacts, connecting it to my accounts. And it wouldn't even send or read a text message. There was about 1-2 seconds of lag in bluetooth between device and my car. Playing the Wait Wait Quiz or Jeopardy game was impossible because the device would time out waiting for an answer when the question hadn't even finished. The Alexa App had a memory leak too, so after connecting and disconnecting so many times it would eventually crash my phone.

"When I was first invited to try this product back in July 2019, I jumped at the chance, especially for the $25 they were asking. Once I got it installed, I was kinda disappointed as it had it's share of software problems. In other words, it was very buggy. Just trying to make her place a phone call was extraordinarily difficult and succeeded rarely. However, after a few software updates, I am happy to say that Alexa Auto performs extremely well! Extremely sensitive, as I can be playing music quite loud and she still hears me. over it. When I am getting close to my home at night, I absolutely love being able to say ""Alexa turn on driveway lights"" (Which actually turns on more outside lights than just the driveway lights).  I even purchased 3 more to give out as Xmas presents this year. The only real annoyance I have with it, when I want to call somebody I will say ""Alexa call John Doe mobile"" She will ALWAYS reply ""You want to call John Doe mobile?"" and I have to say ""Yes"".  It should just immediately say ""Calling John Doe's mobile"" instead of asking me stupid questions. lolI do recommend purchasing the short 6"" USB cables with right angle connectors if you want your installation to be as clean as possible. Your vehicle of course must also be able to support this configuration.  I will submit a photo or two of my installation a little later so you can get the idea. Amazon really should include two lengths of USB cables.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I think it’s really cool... must keep radio on AUX,  but not an issue... just ask Alexa to play your favorite station .... she tells jokes, weather, traffic etc. does everything one at home does but with good sound thru car stereo system.....took a bit to setup, I use provided AUX cable to plug into aux port and select AUX...",5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"I've had this for a couple months now, and I love it.  If you don't already have any sort of hands-free stuff in the car, this is a great addition.  We use it regularly for navigation and listening to music.  Plus, it can do things like call people and read texts, which is great to avoid using your phone while driving.Alexa is usable only when you have a cellular connection, which is an obvious downside.  She also uses your data connection, which isn't ideal if you don't have unlimited data (we don't).  Additionally, she doesn't always recognize things that we try to navigate to, largely because she uses your phone's native gps app, rather than an actual amazon gps app.",4,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"When it works, it is a decent product that allows me additional flexibility in my pre-bluetooth pickup.  The problem is I frequently can't pair it.  The next problem is I can't even discover it re-pair it.  Power it off, try again, still no device.  It does not show up in my Amazon devices, although sometimes it will show up in Bluetooth.  I have a Note 9, so despite my dated vehicle the phone I'm using is quite new.  Once I can get it to pair, I can give Alexa limited voice commands - it's about what you would expect.  Can't configure the sound the way it is described for a wired setup, because I get a constant annoying hum through the speakers.  Instead, I plug the mini-RCA jack into my phone (yay, it still has a port!) and play from phone to car stereo.  Once I get a newer vehicle, I don't see the advantage of having Alexa always available since I can pair my phone directly to the stereo.I wouldn't purchase this product again.",2,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"It's a good addition but I'm a little disappointed.  I've not been able to make the bluetooth connection so simply used the audio cable.  Whenever the car is shut off the Echo Auto seems to forget itself and I have to cycle the power.  What is also annoying is that I have to use Alexa on my phone to confirm I am a passenger.  Perhaps I need to just start over.  The voice recognition is fine and I have enjoyed requesting podcasts, directions, general info and music while driving.  The audio is so-so at best but I've also not played audio from my phone to my car system so that may be the weak point.  I'll update after more effort.",3,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"When I first received the item, I tried making a call through the system. It would call but couldn't hear the other person I called. I was going to return it then but I decided to contact customer service. Originally they wanted me to go to a website, I told them I was not that techy and how could I do when I had to be in my car. They did give a number and I called and after a half-hour, it was working. I fell in love with it. For about few weeks anyway, now I can ask her to do things, but she no longers talks nor can I hear any sound from it. I called the help desk using the number that was given to me, and a recording came on telling because of the Covid-19 they were susspending their call-in services. Amazaon is about be the first company to make a million dollars and they can't afford to pay staff to work the phones? When so many people are out of work.",3,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"I am a big user of Alexa ... Use them all day, every day, happily and oops-free.  Alexa auto is similar but... I have a smart car and park in a garage w/no phone connectivity.  Without phone connectivity, the automatic sequence connecting phone, car and Alexa snafu'd and had to reconnect once i was out if the garage.  I can use the Alexa app on my phone to play music or a book from directly from my phone via bluetooth on my car stereo without using and data etc or initiating a 3-way connection.  So generally the Alexa auto works fine once out in the world and my phone connects, but I have other, easier ways to do most of thesame things - using one fewer devices.  Works as advertised - but I don't need this one.",3,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Amazon apparently put a lot of thought into the design and they got a lot of things right but it can't overcome a couple inherent issues. It requires a solid cell phone signal all the time. Without this Alexa is dumb as a brick. Also, the cords are kind of a mess and hang in front of some controls and whatnot. There's no good way to route the cords and it absolutely needs them. Finally, the Echo Auto does not mount solidly in the air vent. It relies on a friction fit with the rubber mount they supply and it's not quite enough. The voice recognition is impressive and when Alexa has a good cell signal available she's brilliant.",3,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"Many of the reviews on here state various reasons why this device isn't that great......but, I have found an option that many might benefit from.  I use mine in my office at work.  I have it connected to my IHome clock radio I have had forever, using an AUX cord connection.  This allows me to use my Amazon Music app, and also allows use of Alexa to ask questons regarding the weather, traffic, etc.  I know this might not justify the cost of this device, but I missed the return window, so I had to find something to do with it.I agree with other users that as an addition to your car stereo, it's just too much of a pain to be useful.",3,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I like that you can have Alexa and Siri put to use without changing anything but the word spoken. The echo Auto works great far as sound and Bluetooth connection quality, voice commands work great with all extra mics. Has a mute button if needed like the dots and so forth. A lot of room to play in the world with this gadget and Alexas upcoming new skills daily. Who knows what it will be able to do in 6 months with the integrated software but I think it has plenty of room to grow and become one of the best aftermarket auto devices for your entertainment at a reasonable price. Bought two just so could provide as a gift since we’re hard to get last month. Get them while they last because I seen the stands for these sale out upon releasing for sale. Would highly recommend this Amazon product.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"So lets start with some great things... 1. My mercedes speakers are great but my radio sucks.  using Alexa pulls my music through my phone and direct to my speakers.... GREAT, and I mean GREAT Sound.....  2. using Alexa all the time in the house, I have become accustomed to blurting out a question.  She picks up my voice over the radio and responds. 3. She doesn't interfere with phone calls.  Ok.. problems.... 1.  She might need a restart on a long trip.  She seems to get flustered after about 45 minutes (non-responsive).  I don't know if its time or distance. Easy unplug and restart fix.  2. Sometimes there is a difficulty connecting to my I-phone... usually resolves with a restart. 3. Can't fix anything when your driving.  You need to pull over to fix your Alexa addiction.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I have been using this for a few months now. I have a 20 year old truck with an old radio that doesn't even have a jack connection.  I plug Alexa into a bluetooth/cigarette lighter adapter that broadcasts over a particular radio frequency.  I love it. Took old school technology and made it fancy.  I was able to use my phone in bluetooth mode over the radio before, but now its so much better doing it hands-free.I have a bit of an issue about a month ago. the echo auto would not pair with my phone at all suddenly.  I removed the saved bluetooth profile from my saved settings and reconnected from scratch again. It has been fine since then.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I'm really at a loss as to why there are so many negative reviews on this product. I think it's absolutely fantastic. I have a 2011 vehicle with no Bluetooth.  I'm so grateful for this product because I no longer have to listen to the radio or CDs in my car. I have access to Amazon music and the other music providers. This works just like your Alexa in your house. Once in a blue moon you'll drive through a spot where it drops the connection for just a brief moment, but it picks it right back up. Again, this is a very rare occurrence. I would highly recommend this product.  Would I love to not have all the wires? Yes. But that's on me because if my vehicle.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"Having Alexa in the car is handy for those times when a sudden random question is burning in your mind and you simply must satisfy your curiosity. So that's great. I have to rephrase my requests for directions somewhat from what I've been using with Android auto so it's a little clunky. My biggest, and really only serious gripe is that the radio tuner must be set to ""Bluetooth audio"" for it to work. So I either listen to the radio or use Alexa functions, but not both. You can use Pandora, so that at least covers the music angle as long as you've got the data plan to support it. I do love my Pandora station mix, but sometimes I want my satellite radio.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I've had my Alexa auto for a while now, and honestly I probably don't use it for a quarter of what it can be used for.  I mostly use it to listen to music and audio books.  My favorite thing about it though is that it makes it almost like I have bluetooth in my car.  My vehicle is a 2010 Highlander, very basic model so it didn't come with blue tooth.  Having Alexa auto, I can make and answer calls with Alexa, it has helped me be much more hands free.Two critiques I have, the first one and probably the biggest one is: it loses the connection with my phone more often than I would like and i end up having to unplug it and plug it back in to reset it.  Sometimes I am able to just close and reopen the Alexa app, but when that doesn't work I do have to unplug it.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"When it is working, it works well.  If you hit the skip button on the vehicle controls it will stop functioning and require you to turn off the car stereo and turn it back on to continue music.  Sometimes it will not work at all, have to disconnect it from power and restart it to get it to obey commands.  There are many issues that need to be corrected before it will be able to operate as flawlessly as the in home Echos.  All and all it is a great concept, it just needs some tweaking.  The mounting bracket is another issue, why only offer a air vent mounting option?  My Jeep vents just cause it to flip down every time I hit a bump in the road, I would imagine other vehicles may have the same issue....  Should have a window or dash mount adapter included.....",2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"pairing was easy. disappointed in the options for placement since i have an automobile that doesn't have the required air vents. i didn't want it in full display anyway so i mounted it with velcro in a hidden spot. functionally it's not great. driving directions don't present visually on your phone so it's just verbal instructions. i set home while sitting in my driveway and she told me to drive away. i use it mostly for amazon music and even then it's sub-par. after 2-3 songs (after one sometimes), she stops playing songs even though she supposed to play a playlist that has hundreds of songs. i'm glad only paid 1/2 price due to early bird special.",2,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0

After trying for hours, I let the poor rep go and reset my car's Bluetooth (disconnecting my phone and re-adding to my car's Bluetooth device), and VIOLA! It worked!If any of you have Bluetooth in the car, but it's not connecting with your Echo Auto, disconnect/remove your phone from your car Bluetooth and reinstall/re-add it.

When it arrived the set up was seamless very easy connected everything really smooth and the device basically is just having the dot in your car which I like. However I was extremely disappointed that I did not receive the mounting sticky pad. The air vent mount does not work for my car so I had to come up with another way to mount it in my car. To me that took away from the excitement of what I had purchased. I have looked and looked trying to find that sticky pad for sale on Amazon and I can’t find it. 😧 I believe it should be an option to purchase separately, or a choice in the purchase whether you get the vent mount or the sticky mount.",3,1,2019-11-10,1,0,1
works great most of the time but sometimes it loses connection just got it a few days ago ill do a better review after i mess with it.update: OK i have had this for a couple weeks and i have to say i don't understand the negative reviews it works as advertised does everything an echo dot can do and the reason i was losing connections at time was cause my cell phone dropped connection because i live it the stick in Maine not many cell towers here.. i would definitely recommend this product i am very happy with it i did use some double sided Velcro and mounted it to my steering column i have yet to give it a command it cant do!,5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0

"Generally good Alexa product. Would prefer it to be out of sight-would like it to work through my phone/BT only without the eyesore/wires. Easy to set up-took about 5 minutes (including unpacking). One glitch that I would like them to work out however is the issue with the music continuing to play sometimes when you answer a phone call. The caller cannot hear the music in the background but you can. Additionally, when you shut off the car and get out of it, the music will continue to play on your phone sometimes and it is hard to turn it off because no other apps are open to close it down. Other than those few small annoyances, it is nice to have the convenience Alexa on the road especially when you’re not used to telling it to play podcasts or music often.",4,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

I've read the reviews where people complain that there are wires that need to be plugged into this, but I honestly don't mind the wires.

The engineers did try to make the best of this by putting a vent clip on that can hold the cord. I already have enough cords in the car with cell phone USB cords. The device battled with my phone for who was going to use blue tooth (cell phone calls and amazon music). My phone would automatically go back and forth between it's speaker and the car's speakers. After installing Echo Auto, I had to reset my phone's blue tooth with the car to get it to work again. It would be great if Echo was standard on cars like Apple Car Play.

I really wanted to love this.  I use the Amazon Echo in my home and I loved the idea of bringing the convenience of Amazon music and voice commands to my car.  Unfortunately it just doen't work that great.  The device itself I believe works fine but it's usability is dependent on the App (I use the Alexa App on iOS).  The problem is the App is spotty at best and more often than not I am repeating commands and resetting connections trying to get music to play.  It became more of a distraction than anything and it was easier to use Siri and another music streaming service.  Very dissappointed.

"I use this in our 2011 van. No fancy stereo in there...just the basic AM/FM/CD(?) player. Adding Echo Auto turns this into a very good way to listen. Yes it uses your connected phone for data, which seems like an excellent thing to do rather than yet another connected device for some 'small fee per month'. Sound quality (I use the 3.5mm jack to the stereo) is excellent. I haven't experienced any hum from grounding issues that other devices have had (like the Garmin Speak for example) which makes me a very happy driver.

It turned out to be a great purchase for me since I don't have a vehicle with all the communications techy stuff already built in.

It does work well with my Amazon Music, but I can do that with my phone. I would have returned it, but I the time had run out by the time I used it enough to decide it was not a good fit for me.

I had envisioned just being able to plug it in and use seamlessly after initial set up.  This has not been the case, though.Also, I think generally speaking, Alexa sucks at recognizing what music I want.

If the device was like the Alexa eco in your home where it can connect via WiFi or Bluetooth and has its own GPS chip and so on this device would be Worth the money. You can connect your iPhone to your car via Bluetooth open the Alexa app and do everything this device does.,1,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
I got one of these back in January and loves it so much I wanted another. This makes any vehicle smarter by using this device. In conjunction with smart home devices it helps when you come home and all the lights are trigger on. Great piece of technology.  The only con I have is when I first got the one it came with a stick on flat mount which worked great in my Jeep since vent mounts don't work in them. Now this new one came in with only the vent mount. I was a little disappointed in that and you cannot get one online or through customer support. I am giving it only four stars because the lack of the flat mount which would work on all vehicles.,4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I was so looking forward to this product! I use my echo so much that I had been missing it while in the car. I signed up for an invite immediately but still never got mine until it came fully on the market and ordered it direct from Amazon.I was still excited to use my Amazon auto though and hooked it up right away. It didn't take too long to set up and we were on the way. It worked great in my driveway, but that's about where it ended.",2,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"Didn't think this product would be very useful but as time has gone by I have really changed my mind. It is very sturdy, was easy to install and set up and I am getting used to using it more everyday. Turned my older car radio that is without Bluetooth into a very modern and high-tech radio. Now I don't have to spend money on an upgrade. The only drawback was that I had to order a Ground Loop Noise Isolator which cost me $9.99, I was getting background noise when my phone was charging and the GLNI filters out about 98% of the noise which I can live with. You don't really hear it when you have music playing and it's barely audible when on the phone. I would order this product again and I have definitely recommended it to my family and friends........5 Stars!!!",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I confess I am an ALEXA aficionada. I have all-things Alexa in my home and office. It may seem a bit much to add on the car version but there are soooo many good podcasts to listen to. What's more, I can ask questions as well as listen to Amazon music. So what is not to like? Well, cord, size, and the awkward vent attachment which, in Houston heat, covers too much of the a/c flow. I do wish it somehow would connect with Waze as well - although since the map wouldn't show I suppose I probably wouldn't use it for GPS anyway. Price-wise, the reduced $20-$25 is fine: I don't know that I'd pay more.  That being said, I'm a happy camper and realize I probably should have waited for the undoubtedly upgraded version that will be designed.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I really love having Alexa in the car! It makes it super simple to add things to you shopping list or calendar, check the weather or to play a game to pass the time. Having said that, it isn’t a perfect setup. Alexa responds to you through your phone so the sound quality is not great.  Alexa also occasionally struggles to understand what I am saying, more so it seems when the AC is on. There are also those times when she is unable to connect which I assume are those times when my phone doesn’t have good service. And, of course, it doesn’t work if you are actually talking on your phone. Still, all in all, I am happy to have the convenience of Alexa extended to my car. I also want to mention that the vent mount didn’t work with my car’s vents but it hasn’t proven to be a problem. I was easily able to find another place to use the mount (see photo) even though I bought it fully expecting to just lay the unit in the space in front of my console.",4,1,2019-11-24,1,0,1
"I use my alexa auto everyday on my way to work and while traveling with the kids. In my morning routine, I always ask alexa about the traffic and then to give me my morning briefing, after I ask to listen to some music. As far as kids goes it keeps them entertained while driving.I can understand some people are giving it a bad review but I believe it a matter of understanding how to get it connected to your car. My truck has bluetooth and require me to reconnect bluetooth every time I enter my car. I've helped a friend get alexa auto connected to aux mode in a older model hyundai  and it took about 10 minutes before here phone recognized alexa, but once it did she was able to use it without issues. I think every car is different and requires the know how to connect via AUX or Bluetooth. I mean have you tried connecting a iphone to bluetooth in a new mercedes benz s-class? I couldn't figure out where the menu option was and ended up using the voice command button on the steering wheel and ask mercedes to connect my phone.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"The good:  enjoyed being able to easily play my music on the road, get a quick weather update, etc.The not so good:  Requiring a dedicated power cord and have this synced via BT to my car felt somewhat like 1990 having a walkman CD player connected to the car via the tape deck.  Clunky-ish but worked.",3,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"As a family, we love the echo.  We have two original echos, three Dots, and two Shows.  The Auto did not work for us.  Nothing worked perfectly, and one important feature does not work at all.The car power adapter does not sit well in the hole, so if I bump it, the Auto loses power.  Even though the iPhone 7 is connected to the car's bluetooth, and other apps (Waze, phone, etc) use the car audio, we could not get the echo to talk to the car audio.  This is a deal killer right there.  Meanwhile, the Auto keeps dropping its connection to the phone, and we have to reboot the echo to reconnect, nothing else works.  When it can keep a connection, it still doesn't act unless I have great signal, like 4-bar-LTE great.  Finally, when I can get everything else to work, recognition rate is far below what we get at home.  It's frustrating to have to tinker with it for five minutes to get it to work, only have to repeat myself five times.  Very disappointed.  This thing is going in the electronics junk drawer.",2,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I purchased this hand free Alexa to connect with my phone for my car. This little device is amazing, whatever you did for the home Alexa, this little device has the same functions. As soon as your downloaded the app, it connects to your phone (Bluetooth turns on). My kids like to talk to Alexa to listen to their favorite songs. I like to ask weathers and songs while I am driving. It responses very fast when you are talking. Connects very well with my phone. It is so cool to have it in the car.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
"I had such high hopes for this but I find myself still doing everything myself. Like if I tell Alexa to ""open Spotify"" it will start playing a playlist but won't actually open the app. And phone calls. Wow. I'm not sure I'm going to keep this if I can't have phone conversations using it. Everytime I've tried to call someone, or they try to call me, they say that there's echoing and they can't hear me. Multiple people. And every time I've had to disconnect blue tooth & physically pick up my phone to talk. Kinda takes away from the whole ""hands free"" thing. I'm gonna try and figure out why these issues are happening but if I can't then I'm returning.",3,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"This works good at first. Then you realize its flaws over time... it is inconsistent, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Often my ""Alexa,"" is met with a sound tone and lights flashing to no answer or response, it just doesn't do anything but chime. It relies on your phone and the alexa app for data, which I think causes problems. You have to keep your car on the 'Bluetooth' connection to your phone, if you have FM radio or something on and give a command it doesn't work. Maybe this would be nice for someone with a really old car that needs a bluetooth connection? For me it didn't make any sense and I removed it.",2,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"I like many other had such high hopes for this device. This is the first device I haven't loved. Basically this device just connects to your phone to allow Alexa voice commands... nothing more. The connection to your car is through your phone. Uses your phones internet and your phones bluetooth. If you have no phone, this device is useless. you can do the same thing with the Alexa app on your phone. Don't waste your money.

Issues to date: music starts playing when I get in the car even though I said to stop playing music before I left the car.  Lost connection after answering phone call through car bluetooth and using hangup in car to end call.  The chime that goes off after the alexa command is to delayed, probably not needed and should work like home echo.  Asked for directions when driving, and could not tell me even with phone location turned on.  But still enjoy having it, just needs improvement.",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

I thought it would give him the ability to call up specific songs or listen to the police app he likes. All I needed.Instead of making life easier, we’re now arguing every time we get in the car. Driving is more dangerous because he gets frustrated and keeps asking me to fix it, so I’m distracted.  I have pulled over just about every trip and even spent the first 5-10 mins sitting in our driveway to get it just right, only to have issues once I’m driving.",2,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0

I've so quickly become attached to it in my car for directions, music selections, reminders etc...the fact that you can now speak to Alexa in your car without difficulty even over music and several conversations (she) still manages to connect is amazing, as soon as I get in my car and plug in Alexa is connected( no lag there either) HOWEVER the best feature for me is the Announcement skill which I use quite often- wow that has become my favorite child- I use it to announce Everything for example..when I'm almost home, I use it to announce when I've arrived( with bags),unlock the door, let the dogs out and or get outside to assist( all without back talk- again my favorite child).

"I have two, one in each of my cars. If you turn on your Alexa app before you leave the range of your wifi you will lose connection temporarily but will reconnect to mobile wifi. Don't be inpatient as you do have to be out of range and it takes a couple of minutes to establish connection with your carriers wifi to your phone.  As far as directions, I use the waze app and if I ask directions it goes right to waze with no problem. I was amazed how receptive Alexa was to my commands over the sounds of the radio, and I play my music load.  Overall I think the Echo Auto is easy to use and just as good at handling my requests as the ones in my home .  I use it to turn my lights on or off and adjust my thermostat while on the road.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0

"I love me some gadgetry.  And if it involves Alexa, let’s do it. In the battle of Alexa vs Siri vs Hey Google vs Cortana, Alexa seems to lead in response and as I continue to use them in everyday life, it’s nice to know there is continuity throughout. And that was true of everywhere except for the car. Until now. I was rather surprised at the size of the main box. Set up was a cinch and it connected right away. I do prefer the sound of the aux cord over Bluetooth and keeping Bluetooth open allows for me to keep my phone connected. So it’s the best of both words. I am not sure of the practicality and it’s purpose in the car right now, but for those who don’t already have car play I would recommend giving this a shot.

"I was on the beta test of this little gadget.  I gave it a shot because I have an older radio in my car and thought this might extend it's life a little bit.  I am constantly having signal drops and having to unplug this and plug it back in.  Randomly it will ask me if I am a passenger which I don't mind considering but it is never consistent.  My phone connects right away which is nice but when I say ""Alexa"" I don't always get a response causing me to unplug it and plug it back in.  It is more frustrating than convenient.

"To begin, I had the echo auto for about 2 weeks and at the end of the two weeks I decided to get rid of it because it was honestly getting annoying to use.The echo auto is intended for cars that do not already have Apple car play and android auto installed in their cars, therefore adding Alexa to the car, and honestly there are some small things that make this thing annoying. First off, when first starting to set up the echo auto it works completely fine, setting up is a breeze which is set up through the Alexa app. So when your car is set to Bluetooth it is replaced by Alexa, so everything that you are able to do with a regular echo dot is now available through the car. It is when you start to use the system that you start to notice some very annoying quirks. For starters, the echo auto uses your phones internet to connect to the internet, which is a given but it gets super annoying to drive somewhere with your music on but then the music completely stops, then when you try to ask Alexa something she says “I can’t seem to connect to the internet” rendering her useless, even when just playing music it completely stops and it gets annoying at times. Another thing about music is when you try to play it from Alexa it works fine, but it slows down the speed at which the music switches, so if you want to change a song from your steering wheel there is about a 2 second delay before the music switch’s, which is annoying if you want to just play through a playlist. Asking Alexa for directions works alright as well, it sends a notification to your phone through the Alexa app in which you have to open it then it will redirect you to maps.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I was very excited to receive this the Alexa auto and was looking forward to some Alexa fun. Unfortunately I thought that it would be easier to use with my car, like I can talk to Alexa in my house, however I guess because I have a Ford Sync system and android phone, syncing and using isn't that easier. I can't have my normal radio or satellite going and use Alexa, I have to switch my system to Aux for Alexa to work, which is a pain. I used it twice but not since because it is time consuming to have to go from Disney radio on Satellite to turning on Alexa just because I want have it where my kids can ask Alexa to do something. It is so confusing that have of the time my kids are screaming ""Alexa..."" and I have to say, I don't have it switched to that setting. Very frustrating!",3,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"Not sure why people are having a problem connecting but I have an old car with no Aux plugs or Bluetooth on the radio and I have zero issues.

I've essentially turned my AM/FM/CD radio into an infotainment system (I also have Sirius/XM for the internet, so I get Sirius/XM in my vehicle without having to buy another plan).  I'm sure that if I leave the local area I may have to work a bit to find another clear FM channel, but for around the local area this thing is sweet. Alexa/Amazon Music/Sirius XM all for a small cost. I've already told my wife we're going to cancel her Sirius/XM for her car, because we can pay for the Alexa Auto with just 3 months of Sirius XM payments.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0

No arguing over radio stations, we could all take turns asking to play our music or make playlists. It even plays games so we have jeopardy and song trivia etc with kids versus adults or front seat versus backseat. It really made the traveling much more enjoyable and easy. It also kept me entertained while everyone else fell asleep. LoL.

Also if your phone service is trash, this product wont work well for you. It runs off your phone service using blue tooth. IT IS NOT A STAND ALONE PRODUCT. So be aware of that. I read some of the 1 stars, and most are silly, the item functions as intended, and like any sound product, you must speak clearly, it does not know slang, or mumble. YOU need to be clear.

Although I finally figured out how to adjust the Echo volume, it's still not the same level as my radio. I have to manually switch from radio to media if I want to talk to Alexa, adjust her volume way up to hear her reply, manually switch back to radio, quickly adjust volume down because the sound now blasts painfully loudly. If I'd paid full price for the Echo Auto, I would definitely return it. Not worth the inconvenience to use it while driving.

I decided to replace it with the echo auto because it would be better then using my phone for directions. I can't handle the cords and it only tells me to hook up to my stereo, it will not talk to me except through my stereo. If grandkids are in the back asleep I don't want to talk through my stereo.

It works just like any other echo with one major flaw, it doesn't have a built in speaker.  It requires a bluetooth connection for replies which means I can't use it while listening to XM, or non-Amazon music, or GPS, or really anything a normal person would be doing in a car.

"The Amazon Echo works well as both an Echo device and as a hands-free, Bluetooth to AUX adapter (if you need one of those).  It nicely incorporates the Echo/Alexa ecosystem into your car. The array microphone picks up your voice very well and controlling podcasts, music, Spotify, TuneIn, etc… works just as well as the regular Echo devices.  “Drop in” is an interesting alternative to a regular phone call, and interactive audio games can be entertaining on the road.Echo Auto works best when it’s powered up with the ignition switch and then powered off when you leave the car. Leaving It powered on all of the time and walking out of Bluetooth range causes reconnection delays and/or failures. Recovery from cell phone dead zones is spotty too; sometimes it’s seamlesss and other times it fails miserably. When it fails, it requires stopping or having a tech savvy passenger dig thru the Alexa app menus. iOS sometimes kills the Alexa app as well which also requires using the phone in-hand.  Connection recovery (cell signal, Bluetooth drops & app kills) needs improvement; hopefully Amazon developers will be able to fix it.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

I would recommend it to anyone that uses it for adding items to their shopping list, utilizes the smart home features or listens to their daily flash brief on their way to work. With that being said there are a few issues I've run into with it. It's best to know these up front, in case it's a deal breaker for you...1. The maps option is not very good. It will connect to your existing navigation apps, which is nice. But, I asked it to get directions to Walmart and it said, ""Hmm, I don't know that one."" So it isn't very helpful in that regard.

"Echo Auto is completely useless to me until it lets me use the internal speaker. This was a gift to me. I was willing to use it, but during the setup I was extremely annoyed to find out that despite having its own internal speaker that you use for installation, Echo Auto won’t use it after setup. It FORCES you to use Bluetooth or an Aux cable. What I want: to listen to my radio and sometimes ask Alexa for some directions, weather, or add things to a shopping list. I cannot listen to the radio unless I constantly fumble my car’s audio between radio and Bluetooth for the Alexa.

"The Echo Auto has a lot of potential. I was lucky to get this product via invitation a few months ago, but as time went on, it became progressively buggy and unresponsive. Sometimes Alexa won't respond and it'll glitch out forcing me to unplug the car charger and plugging it back in again. Also, for some reason the app in relation to Echo Auto will not register my home address. For example, when I ask Alexa to take me ""home"" after inputing my address into the app, alexa tells me my home address isnt there. Its extremely frustrating.

It isn't nearly as friendly as the echo for your home. It isn't as easy to use in the car as the Google assistant on my phone.Update I have had this for one year and it will not remain paired with the phone.

If you do not unplug it every single time you shut off your car it does not find your phone when you get back in the car the next time. Also, it remains connected to your phone, when you are at home and in your house. It should be able to detect when the car is off somehow, and automatically disconnect. It is very inconvenient, and I rarely remember to unplug it. Therefore, when I want to use it, it rarely is connected to my phone. It is mostly just a hassle, and a distraction while I am driving.

I find I really only use it to play some audible books and the occasional podcast - which I could almost as easily do a ""hey siri"" to accomplish.  The biggest detractor for me is that I need to flip to Bluetooth input just to interact.  It'd be far more useful if it played over Bluetooth as a phone call so you didn't need to fiddle with inputs just to ask a question (future feature please).

This is obviously more dangerous than just hitting the button for voice assistant on my phone.On a longer drive, you can get it to connect and it works as expected.

I've been trying everything to fix it and have had nothing but frustration and yelling matches with Alexa. Even when it was connecting, the lag in response frequently mademe repeat the command, further confusing myself and Alexa. I've found it barely useable and am considering returning it if something doesn't give.Update: seems to have fixed itself but it still can't decide whether it wants to use bluetooth or auxilary input.

It does not know that I am sitting in my driveway and the car isn't even on (except the key is in the ACC setting).  However the Auto Alexa does a much better job to understanding my voice when asking to make a phone call by voice.

I installed it and it is so buggy, I find myself yelling at it the whole way to work, just to TRY to get it to play music!! Forget having it do anything else. I hate this device so much that I actually feel violent towards it. Ugh!",1,1,2019-10-20,1,1,0
"Overall I enjoy this Alexa product, but there are several kinks that need to get worked out.I very much enjoy being able to utilize Alexa and all the functions that I could at home while on the road.  Being able to turn my lights on and off while driving is awesome, being able to request music without having to worry about picking up my phone is great, and also being able to use hands free calling while driving in my older car that doesn’t have Bluetooth is fantastic.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I was not sure what the echo auto could provide that my Android Moto with Alexa couldn't.  I finally hooked it up and was pleasantly surprised.  For me, it consolidates things, so everything is  voice activated and I'm not pushing phone screens or dials.  I like it.  Unless I'm doing something wrong, when I use it to make calls, I believe I have to shut off echo mics and have my voice transmit through phone as otherwise everyone says I sound like I'm underwater.  I was on the Mass pike and asked Alexa for closest Wendy's.  It listed 3, gave mileages and told me I could ask it to take me to the closest one.  This information is only partially helpful when you are on a limited access highway, as the closest to you doesn't mean the closest in your direction on the same highway you are on.  Interestingly, it did not pick up on the closest one to me, until I got within a few miles of it.  I imagine that is not Alexa's issue, but the navigation system used, but I'll keep experimenting.  Overall, as I said, I am liking it and finding it useful.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I was skeptical, we are an “Alexa Household”, with 1/2 dozen units scattered around the house, we listen to music, check weather, update schedules, add items to the grocery list, the kids use Alexa as a research tool for school, plus a thousand other random things a day, we love Alexa. But I wasn’t sure how that functionality would transfer into the car, now that I’ve had it for a month I don’t know how I ever survived without. Alexa lets me check my schedule, update my calendar, fine the nearest restaurant, gas station, directions, plus read my latest audiobook, or play any song I can remember rom my youth, all completely hands free!",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"I have been using Amazon Alexa enabled devices in my home and for the most part we love them. I have 40+ including 3 Echo shows, 4 Echos and Echo Dots, a Echo Tap, 10 Amazon Blink 2 cams, loads of smart plugs and Hue lights and we have been pretty happy with them. Got the Echo Auto in November and it was a easy install in the car. the primary selling point for getting the Echo Auto was to use as a car phone because of the 8 mics and it would be better than the FM transmitters that I have been using in the car to make calls from my iPhone XR MAX and send to Bluetooth to hear over the cars speakers. so for the past month I have been making calls and people say they have trouble hearing me well sometimes. the Echo Auto is connected to my air vent and positioned a foot and a half in front of me at just below chin height. I understand I am calling from a moving vehicle but when using the phone on speaker phone not connected to Bluetooth they can hear me just fine and much louder.phone is about 6 inches away from Echo Auto. the other thing that is very annoying is even when playing music at a low volume I have to ask alexa several times to play music from a different app (tune-in) before it will play. whne I say the wake word it beeps tone so I know it is ready for my command. also after playing for a short while it will just stop playing and I have to ask it to play again. this doesn't happen very often with my other Alexa devices. and maybe this is by design but if I get a phone call even if its very short it does not resume playing music. this is especially annoying because I am using Tune-in and every time you start playing station again it gives several commercials first. I do like the convenience of asking for weather conditions and my commute time. Over all I do like it but if I have to recommend this to my friends I have to be upfront about what the pro's and cons are.Dean R.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I have several Alexa devices throughout my home, so I was looking forward to having one in the car, but this isn't it. After a successful set-up running it through my iPhone and auto bluetooth and testing the audio to make sure it was working, I started with my first command - ""Alexa..."" It responded with the 'ready' tone...""What time is it?""...silence. I tried again. It chimed 'ready', then did nothing. I went through every restart option, including going through the set-up process all over again. Same effect. I tried the online chat to troubleshoot, but that was a joke. I was bounced to six different people and when the last one finally told me he'd need to look for someone else to help, I gave up and returned the item.

The good... I don’t have Bluetooth on my car and the radio stations here are blah first of all.  I love getting whatever song I want from Amazon Music whenever I want it and I Heart Radio stations from back home. I mainly love it for that most of all. The sound quality thru my speakers is amazing! Way better than radio hands down!I can turn on my lights in my house from anywhere if I am late getting home. That is so cool to me!

"Pretty convenient to have around in the car. I did have to upgrade my cell plan because I used up so much data the first month (will probably just opt for my carrier’s unlimited at some point). I use it mainly for music. My kid likes to ask Alexa random questions at home, so now he can do it in the car as well. As far as connectivity to Amazon, it just depends on your carrier and coverage (this device connects via bluetooth to your phone). I noticed some areas I’ve driven through have dead spots so Alexa will drop. I also noticed there’s a buffer when streaming music, so if I get out of a dead zone in time, there won’t be any drops in my stream.",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"I had nothing but issues every time I tried to use this device. If the device loses internet connection for even a second, the device fails to reconnect to the stereo and the phone without troubleshooting issues. While driving, it is difficult to keep a good internet connection at all times. This is not something I want to deal with while driving. I had one driving experience that went without an issue. Other times I could have connection issues the second I entered the car. This seems like an example where a product that serves as a bridge between two types of technology ends up being more difficult to use than is worth.",1,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"When it works, this is super useful, and will be even more so as the technology develops.  But for now... First, it often inexplicably loses its connection to the Alexa app on my phone (Android LG V50), requiring a reboot of either the phone or the unit or both (which gets annoying and distracting.)  When it's working, though, it has a lot of useful features, and its customizability, while fun, mostly makes one long for the day it'll be WAY more customizable, (especially in ""routines"".)  (And, why non memorize more nicknamed favorite locations instead of only ""home"" and ""work""?) Voice recognition is oddly inconsistent - sometimes amazingly and quickly accurate; other times it insists you're saying something that you're not (especially a location), and there's no convincing it otherwise.  One other note, cars with a lot of road noise (like my Toyota RAV4) require a clear command very close to the unit to get it to recognize the wake word.  But as this technology develops, ability to have easy voice-commanded directions and time estimates to destinations, along with the other calendar stuff, news briefings, time/date/weather checks, etc., is gonna be fantastic.  Bottom line, still well worth having if you're an early adopter and want to help work out the kinks.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I received this item a couple weeks ago and took it on a drive 840 miles to FL, and 840 miles back home.  It worked okay, and integrated some familiar things into my vehicle.  It has failed to connect via bluetooth to my phone on numerous occasions.  I finally used the ""forget this device"" option and reconnected it.  It still fails to connect sometimes.  The mounting bracket doesn't work very well.  After it had fallen off my air vent for the 5th or 6th time, I finally just let it sit on the console.  The thing that supports the cable onto the bracket broke.  Overall, I'm not as happy as I should be about this product.

I own Roav viva device and I have noted that works way faster and even though that also gives trouble sometimes ( that is why I had very high hopes for Echo Auto ).Installation I need to call to understand, you have to go to Echo and then within Echo, choice for Echo auto is there when you install.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0

"The single wake word sucks, especially for individuals with the name Alex or Alexa, I own an original echo and guess what I have it setup to call it echo, I can understand the progaming logic of using a single wake word, or a fixed number but use a wake word other than a common name if you are using a single wake word, like Bixby, Google, Cortana or Siri, this product is so poorly thought out that amazon the company who made and sells the product lists in the review an option to rate it's touch screen a feature it does not have. There are legitimate technical barriers that this device incurs, such as needing internet, which is pulled from your phone, it begs the question however, what can it do that your phone can't? Not much really but it provides a better hands free experience, in theory atleast, being told it can't find songs that it has access to and that it can't communicate right now sucks especially given that it was in an area with good reception, the car was not in motion, the phone it was interfacing with was a foot away with no obstructions and an analog connection was used. Overall making an adapter to use an echo dot off a dc outlet would have been a better idea, and that is taking into account setting up a phone to tether so as to provide internet connection. Overall the product has a great form factor, however what would have been a great design that went unimplimented is to accomadate an external microphone which would allow a potentially cleaner looking install with the device itself not needing to be placed in a location with good acoustics, and as a result high visability.",3,1,2019-10-13,1,1,0

And I was excited to use Alexa while I was driving.  But alas, as many of the other reviews  the voice recognition with Alexa is mostly non-existent.

"My overall impression of the new Amazon Echo Auto is fairly positive. The Echo Auto works like any other Echo device, offering the full suite of services and features with integration with your vehicle.

This might sound stupid but sometimes I don't want to use her because I want to flip around stations and it's just easier if I can see which ones they are on my Dash. The other thing is she has to be connected to my Bluetooth so I have to connect. It also takes a while to hook up and it loses connection multiple times, which means my radio is gone too.

Trying to integrate it using Google maps was laughable. It would repeatedly come up with the incorrect address. I would then bypass it and use voice command on Google maps with no problem. The only thing I could get it to do reliably and well was play music using voice commands. I really love my echo in the house and was really hoping this would be a nice alternative for a hands-free phone option in the car.

Got this for Christmas from my son. He was so excited for me to try it. I tried it for a good 4 days. First it took awhile to get it to connect. Once connected it worked for a little while. However I couldn't keep it connected. I finally realized it was my cars remote start. If I used my remote start it would not reconnect once I got in the car. No matter how hard I tried I could not get it to connect to my phone once in the car. Once I got it to finally connect it would only connect if I did NOT remote start my car. Well this is Wisconsin in winter...Remote start is essential! Needless to say it has been returned. It's not worth all the trouble to stay connected. I should be able to hop in my car and have a connection instantly without all the fuss. Also with newer cars...your car probably does just about everything this does.,1,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"My first sinking feeling came when I saw that one of my cars didn't have an AUX port--turns out you don't need it if your car supports Bluetooth, at one point in the installation it asks you this then says (ostensibly) ""then unplug the AUX cable, you don't need it"". When it came online and I had everything linked it was initially terrible! I was thinking about just sending both of them back (I ordered 2) but read the best practices for installation and it had a great point. 99% of the people who install this will be doing it IN THEIR GARAGE.  You may be on the edge of your home wi-fi signal, which your phone is still attempting to use. SHUT OFF THE WI-FI ON YOUR PHONE to force cellular data (which it will be using while you're on the road anyway). Made ALL the difference. At that point it responded immediately and worked just like the Alexa interface I'm used to in my home. Very cool is being able to turn on your lights by voice as you pull in.

I thought ok, I'll play some of my favorite trivia games, well, most of the time Alexa does not understand my answers and I don't have that problem when I play them at home.

I actually had to delete my Spotify app for it to finally stop.  Irritating to say the least.  She will turn on the lights in my house from my car and I can set reminders and put things on my shopping list.  Of course, if you drive through a dead zone you will lose connection.

"Our whole house works off of Alexa, so we were excited to add a unit to our car, but it just doesn’t work as well as our other units. First, it takes a bit to learn how to sync it to your phone and car. It has a large obnoxious hanging apparatus and cord that now drapes across the front seats. Once the car is turned on, it takes a couple blocks of driving before it starts working. And, it doesn’t have any connection to our home units so it won’t play songs that we’ve paid extra for in the house (i.e. amazon music unlimited). It’s fun to have, but needs work.

"We have Echos all over our house that we love. But for the car, the Echo Auto is already looking to be more trouble than it's going to be worth - for us.Problem 1 is that if you share a car, and have 2 phones, you can't really choose which phone connects and therefore, which Amazon account is in play for any given trip. That's rather a big deal. That would have been Job One to solve, if I was directing this product development. Problem 2 is that you have to have the Alexa app running on your phone. If it's not, you've got to fumble to get your phone, find and open the app and wait for it all to wake up. If I'm going to go to that trouble, I can just use the phone directly - something I've just realized I could do, since I placed the order for the Echo Auto device. Problem 3, if you don't have a great phone battery - then you've got to plug your phone in. And, the way we've got is set up, the dash has sprouted 2 more ugly cables for power and AUX connections. Oh yes - you've got to have a good cell data connection too.",2,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"We have Echo's throughout our home. Front door, back door, kitchen, living room, bedrooms, garage etc so we use them all day everyday. Our entire home is a smarthome thanks to the Insteon Hub, Alexa and smart devices. We have replaced our wall light switches, added ceiling fan controllers and linked our Nest, Kuna and Simplisafe to Alexa. We can lock and unlock doors, turn on/off scenes, fans, thermostat ...you name it. So when I got Alexa Auto installed in my car (which took me less than 5 minutes) I was in heaven. While driving I can tell Alexa to do everything I can do in my home. I also listen to a lot of Pandora which I love a lot more than SiriusXM so now I just say 'Alexa play Smooth Jazz on Pandora' and in seconds I am.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"Well this is a great product but like anything else it does have some downfalls. I have an Iphone X that this connects to. Cons; 1, You must have the Alexa app running on your phone for this to work. 2, it’s iphone/ios/Waze integration is a little lacking. 3, It’s quicker on somethings due to the integration to just say Hey Siri and let her do it directly. 4, the vent mount sometimes falls out when going over a bump (had to wire tie it) Pro’s; 1, great to ask it to play what ever song or song list you want. 2, great integration with telling your smart home devices what to do. 3, recognizes commands very well. 4, very small.",4,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I had a hard time at first getting it to work correctly. It has bugs, such as once I play Amazon music, I have to restart my phone to clear it from my phone once I am done. Since the volume is ultimately controlled by my phone, I have learned to make sure my volume is up before I start driving so I am not fumbling to turn it up. Of course I can turn the volume way up in my car, but often I forget to turn it down before switching from media to radio, and it scares the living daylights out of me and everyone else. A few adjustments on my end and it works alright. I mainly use it for longer trips so most of the time it sits idle.",4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"Before buying this I read through the reviews and noticed SEVERAL people complaining about connection issues.  I ignored the complaints thinking to myself ""I'm special.  This will work fine for me!""  How stupid I was...This thing is garbage.  As the others have said, it works great when I first connected  it but after that, NOTHING.  Doesn't work.  What a shame.  I was excited to get this but turned out to be a horrible letdown.  I want a refund.",1,1,2019-11-9,1,0,1
"Sound quality & voice recognition depends on your car's sound system and ambient noise. My VW 2010 TDI is very good for both, my Toyota matrix 2003 with carpeting stripped out is bad for both. I have an sony/android auto system in the vw. Integration takes a while to get used too. My phone does a double integration in vw: one for EA and one for the sony system .  I disliked it at first but I was not used to using Alexa on my car and what i'd use it for. I am learning. I can do all the normal in home echo bits (list manipulations, ordering, checking status, set timers + sms text & make calls (i Android Auto does the SMS & phone integration, but i am more used to alexa than google), play audio stuff, turn on/off devices at home etc.) It seems good at getting locations, directions etc. but have not used extensively. I am driving from NY to Colorado soon so will put thru paces.",4,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"I’m still trying to get this to work, I have a new car so all the best blue tooth connections but it has to be re set up every time and I could never get it to work consistently on car speakers. It was great on speaker of my phone. Like it made the Alexa app work  hands free only through speaker on phone which is kind of annoying. When it worked on car speaker it was great.  I should have returned it but trying to find time to call support and see if it will work right but from the other reviews I doubt it. It’s a bummer because I love my Alexa, I think some of the people that rigged a echo dot in their car have had better success. Maybe Amazon is not very interested in making the auto work. We know they have the ability, but perhaps no desire.",3,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"I love having an Alexa device in my vehicle.  The device is small, compact and easy to install.  I wish that it didn't rely on me having to change my radio to 'bluetooth' channel, but honestly I cannot rate this device on that as all bluetooth devices require you to change to a bluetooth channel.  I also love the ease of texting hands-free to people - though everyone seems to get both a text message and an audio file of my voice to the recipient -- which doesn't make sense...why is Echo Auto sending both?  Haven't figured that out.  I have also noticed that there is a little delay when making a request.  I will say ""Alexa"" and there is anywhere from a 2 to 5 second delay before the tone (ding) sounds to let me continue my request - sometimes there is no tone --- the light will flash, no tone and then the light goes out.One thing that bothers me that happens more often than I care for is Echo Auto does not carry out a command.  This usually goes something like this...  ""Alexa""  (ding)  ""Play Pandora"" -- no response and no action.  I will repeat the request several times -- with no response.  On several occasions I will get frustrated and in a firm commanding voice say ""ALEXA""  ""PLAY PANDORA"" and it will respond.  It was cute the first 3 or 4 times, but now that is getting old which is why I gave it a 4 Star overall score.",4,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"There are a number of reason why this product is not useful to me. First the integration with the phone app is not there at all, example make a call on skype or whatsapp hands free doesn't work, navigate only default to apple maps and not google maps and you still have to touch the screen, listening to a podcast that it's on the phone doesn't work, it tries to download it again and again, it's very data thirsty and require alexa to have position always on which is not something I'm comfortable with since i now get location driven target ads. It's very sluggish taking sometime 30 sec to reply to a question, you may enable your ""hey google"" or ""hey siri"" and bypass amazon all together, the only advantage is doing ""drop-in"" hands free, which you could do with the alexa app + voice on. Net net not a good product, unless are you care is doing drop in your other alexa app and you have unlimited data. Also ""play the last station"" doesn't really sync with your other alexa devices.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I Love my Alexa Auto, that being said I have decided to keep it in the glove box so that it does not get stolen. Some times this makes it hard for Alexa to hear me especially if there is traffic noise and typical car noise. Alexa does have a hard time connecting sometimes but I think that is partly my phones fault. If you love Alexa, then Alexa auto it totally worth it, set up was confusing, and I don’t love the coords (I don’t have Bluetooth in my car) But it’s still totally worth it to me 😃 Drop in from car to home Alexa is one of the best things ever, not to mention getting to add stuff to lists when I think of them in the car 😍😍😍😍😍😍",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I really like having Alexa in my car. We have several in the house and it fully integrates with all of our Echos. I make lists, listen to podcasts and radio stations from my hometown, etc. We have sketchy radio service in my town, so Echo Auto has been a game changer for me. I can send and receive my text messages while driving, make phone calls, etc. What I really like about it is I can have her take notes while I'm brainstorming while driving. I have a Nissan Pathfinder and the vent clip doesn't work for me and needed an RCA cable to hook up my audio. I just put her in my closed, bottom center console and she hears me just fine and responds to my commands (and it's super discreet this way). Totally worth it if you use Alexa in your everyday life like we do!",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,1
"First, let me start out by saying I rarely write reviews, and when I do they are either very positive or very negative.  For this product, I am giving it FIVE stars as it FAR EXCEEDED my expectations, but you need to understand the problem you are trying to solve before you make a purchase.  With new vehicles equipped with excellent navigation, CarPlay or Android Auto this probably isn’t for you.My car is nearly 13 years old, and although it allows me to Bluetooth to my phone for phone calls only, music is only available via an AUX cable.  This isn’t terrible, BUT, what Alexa brings to my car is not only incredible BUT also solves what I call the “car phone fuzz” dilemma.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"The interface is clunky and I often find myself saying ""Alexa"" over and over again and repeating commands.  This also doesn't seamlessly integrate into many of my applications like the Echo does at home.  This may be operator error or overly high expectations, but I haven't had the same issues with my Echos at home (I have 4).  Even something as simple as playing music from Spotify seems to give me trouble, but to the Echo family's credit, the other devices I use at home (Echo Dots, Fire TV Cube) work well enough that my 4 & 6 year olds can use them.  The same can't be said about the Echo Auto.  I've recommended other Amazon devices to people, but would not recommend this one at this time.",2,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I was one of the selected to for invitation only and  received this item before it was released to the public and returned before as well. I couldn’t even write a review warning everyone not to buy because it wasn’t released. Long story short, I couldn’t just get in and say “Alexa, insert command” without having to press play on the integrated Bluetooth in my RAM. Sometimes she would say try again later and most the time there was a delay and skips in alexas voice when doing what I said. It was one of the worst buys I’ve ever done and I got it with a mount for $25. I still returned because it didn’t work well with my 2015 Ram. I wouldn’t buy this item.",1,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I was thrilled to get the invite for Alexa Auto. This has been on my wishlist for over a year. I have three Alexas in my house, countless smart plugs, been an Amazon member since 2012. I’m a big audible user, go on lots of road trips and I was ready to put Alexa to use in my car. But it just doesn’t work. I live in a city, not a rural area. Alexa repeats my request, tees up the music and then says she’s unable to play it. I stopped trying entirely after about two weeks of frustration and failed requests despite connection and feedback that indicated she understood my requests. I returned to iTunes, googlemaps and Waze which clearly have their bugs sorted out. Alexa Auto? Not so much.",1,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
I have a 2011 Hyundai and I absolutely love the car but hated it did not have the smart phone integration like Apple car play and androids version of that. The Echo Auto got me that feature at a low cost and maybe even a step higher as I can now voice control many features. I like talking to my car - Alexa play driving playlist. The music connectivity is fixed for me but there are somethings more I would like to see. Like if you do have a new model car with smartphone connectivity why not have Alexa auto be like a smart phone with access to maps and using the on screen features like Apple car play give you? I also had times when I could not get Spotify to play through Alexa and I don't know why. I works most of the time but a couple of glitches.,4,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0

"Like many others, I was so looking forward to finally getting Echo Auto.  And evidently like so many others, I’ve been so disappointed.  Unlike Echo Dot, Echo Spot et al, the Echo Auto is reliably unreliable. Frequently “I’m having trouble connecting to the network,” or “can’t connect to the phone.”  Give me a break.  Amazon says the Echo Auto is out of beta, but I’m not so sure of that.  On a positive note, Amazon phone support for the  Echo Auto is stateside-based and pleasant to chat with, even though issues are not resolved.Note:  running the Alexa app on an iPhone 11 Pro in a Jeep Cherokee with Car Play.",1,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
I have been using a different product for Alexa functionality in my car for over a year so am familiar with having this functionality. The previous product worked fine but had some issues connecting to its app. The official Alexa product from Amazon works much better. It is faster at responding and connects to the Alexa app just about every time. The times it doesn't have been due to something I did with my phone.I mainly use this product for listening to audiobooks from Audible.com and streaming Sirius XM. It works great for both of them. I can control both things with my voice easily. I also use Waze for driving directions. I usually go to work and home with it and can open the app with my voice. I say where I want to go (again these are set in my Waze app) and it starts the drive. I don't have to touch my phone at all.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"Amazon seems to have missed the mark here. It works, kind of. It can do what Echo's can do, but there is a HUGE lag between saying Alexa, until it starts listening.

"I love the Alexa’s in my home and have multiple devices there.  I was hoping having an Alexa in the car would also be helpful.  I was very disappointed.  It took awhile to set up because I could not get it to connect properly.  When it is hooked up,  I have to switch it over to Bluetooth on my stereo every time I want to use Alexa and then switch it back to my satellite radio.  It’s very inconvenient!  There is a more of a delay for responses with auto Alexa than the regular one and causes me to have to ask for things multiple times.  My Alexa app has also changed since installing this product and I now have to click an extra button before I can open the app certifying that I am not driving.  This screen even appears when I’m inside a grocery store and trying to check my shopping list!  Frequently when I get back in the car and try to use Alexa, she will say that it’s not able to connect and I need to reconnect using the app.  I’m still keeping auto Alexa for now because I’m hoping they will fix some of these issues.  My fingers are crossed!",2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"If I was more ambitious I would return it.  It has to hook to your phone and then hook into the car radio. The alexa response is pretty slow. It all depends on you cellphone. The only thing I wanted to do was listen to music on it, but unlike the Echo devices in my house , this car version was not registered to my wife's prime account. So I couldn't listen to music without signing up. The only thing I could probably do is add stuff to my grocery list. I'm not sure what it does that Car Play or Android Auto can't. It's like the answer to a question nobody asked. I wish I would have saved my money. Pretty Janky device.",1,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0

Sometimes it would not pick up my voice at all; sometimes the response time took much longer than siri on my iPhone.  Then, I could never get it to properly integrate to my iPhone contacts, so I could not make calls or texts hands free.  I will stick with siri for my hands free needs.",1,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0

I won't say its all on Amazon, the product or function (though the function was not up to Alexa snuff) - but its usefulness is just not there if you have a smartphone and ability either through Bluetooth or audio jack in to your car system.  I was hoping it would be an improvement over my in-car system and also bring my Alexa world into the car.  Not so much.  It was about 50/50 on hearing/recognizing voice commands, was slow to actual tasks when it did respond, and connectivity was poor.  I had to reset up several times and soon became not worth it.",2,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0

Then it looses connection consistently so when it finds it again I have to open the app while driving and clear the code which prevents Alexa from operating until I tell it I am not driving.. and I am!!! Then the vent clip won’t hold so it keeps falling out and to the car floor. It’s easier  to just not use it or open my phone app and use my phone!!!

When Alexa is summon the Interface works just as you expect and my kids use it all the time when they are in the car with me.  Overall I’m very happy with my Echo Auto and would recommend to anyone.The only comment i feel is very important to make is that the WiFi to the Echo Auto is your wireless data plan.

Like it doesn't do anything to let you know that the thing heard you for at least 5-6 seconds. By this time, you're repeating it and now it's confused. My other 11 Echo devices all came synced to my Amazon account. This one did not. Don't ask for directions unless you want to be pointed to your phone for them, as you are being reminded that distracted driving is bad. It literally asks you if you are a passenger when you go to access the directions the device just sent you. I waited so long for this to be available and am so disappointed in it. This was the worst device Amazon has put out. I'd love to be on a panel to help them figure this mishap out, but for you, don't waste your time.

I have tried at least 4 times and while I'm not a techie, I regularly install and use my tech devices.  It seems to connect and then later says it has lost the phone connection.

"First of all, full disclosure I am not someone that is big into technology.  I have a samsung galaxy A series phone that does what I need it to do. I really wanted this device mostly for 2 reasons.  1. stream amazon music without fooling around with my phone while I'm driving 2. get directions without fooling around with my phone while I'm driving. I don't mind listening to the radio driving around town, but on longer trips it is nice to have hands free access to my music.  I thought this feature worked pretty well.  The navigation, on the other hand, not so much.  Alexa uses my google maps app to obtain directions and if my map app is not open and running, she doesn't work.  So I have to get my phone out while I'm driving in order to open the app and that pretty much defeats the whole purpose of not fooling around with my phone while I'm driving.  I've also had  it disconnect from the car 4-5 times now since I've owned it in the last 4 months and I have to start completely over with set up.  This is frustrating. Granted, it could be my phone but either way I don't have the patience to deal with it. I may just keep it in the glove compartment until I'm going on a road trip. Just in case you are wondering,  I have a 2013 toyota sienna with bluetooth and navigation but if you want directions while you are driving, it shuts off the digital menu and requires voice commands but it has never worked well for me.",3,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

I can be sitting in the car, my network displaying there is a connection to Alexa Auto, the Alexa App shows it is connected but it still doesn't work.

Over all, for 25 it is ""ok"" but I wouldn't pay more for it knowing what I know now. Also, amazon music is now handsfree, so if it's music we're talking about here, you don;t need one for hands free operation. Audio quality is good with Iphone SE, and Kenwood in dash unit.

For example, My Pandora App itself has ""Offline Mode"" so it will play stored music. But if you ask Alexa Auto to play pandora, it doesn't use my app, it streams it using Cellular Data even though I have Cellular Data turned off for Pandora itself.Between the frustrations and the data use we literally gave it away!!",2,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
My wife says of all the echos we have the echo auto is her favorite.  We can control the lights at home.  Listen to audible.  Ask for any song just like we do at home. Ask for the weather or news.

The only problem we have is with the connection to our 2014 Toyota Avalon if we switch the source on the car over to FM then switch back to blue tooth it doesn't hook up again until we restart the car.

I got this for half the price through the invitation. I wouldn't pay more than $25 for this. While its helpful....it doesn't do what I was hoping it would. It connects to Waze. It recognizes ""home"" and ""work"" but if I say another location (which is saved on the Alexa app), I get nothing. For $50, we should be getting more...giving traffic conditions, being able to say a location for travel and have it pull up directions.

"What a joke.  Required a phone and Amazon app to use (not just to set up). Requires two wires to hang in the open and creates a ground loop with the connection that requires an additional filter to remove noise. Frequently disconnects from radio and is hard to reconnect.  Prompts you with “do not use while driving” to make you say “I’m a passenger”. Royal pain. Much worse than the ones in the house. Frankly, I’m liking little things about my Google device.

"There are a lot of good reasons to get and use this.  First and foremost, you'll be fumbling with your phone less while driving.

I have a very short commute, not long enough to listen to a 30 minute news podcast, but I can certainly see getting a daily news briefing in the car.  Beyond music, the other things you use Alexa for are less necessary in a car.I use my in-home Alexa for music, timers, and shopping lists more than anything else.  Music, totally use that in the car.  Shopping and timers?  Not nearly so often.

"I originally put in for the Echo Auto on the date that Amazon announced it, then had to wait almost a year to get the product (just before it got released to the masses).  My car has bluetooth so I figured adding this device would be a breeze.  It really wasn't easy, but I got it done.  Having had a Garmin Speak, I half expected the connectivity to be spotty until this thing had a chance to update firmware.  Not sure if that's what happened, but this device was virtually useless until it magically came to life after a several hour ride.  Oh well, it's running now.  For the record, the exact same series of events occurred when setting up an additional unit in the wife's car.Now that it's running, it's great.  It integrates with  all of the music apps I need.  The best part of this is that SiriusXm is now available so switching stations through Alexa is easy.  Waze works well enough, I'm able to make and receive calls, and it acts as any echo device for smart home integration.  My car rides now mostly consist of telling Echo what to play, and outside of a couple of areas of spotty cell service, Alexa is up to the task.",4,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I was very excited to get this, but what a huge disappointment.  Two show-stopper issues in my view:1) You can't just say ""Alexa, what's the weather"".  You have to say ""Alexa"", and then wait for a beep.  This is terrible.  It throws off your whole flow.  This needs to be consistent with Alexa UI in your home.",2,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"I am an Avid Alexa user, but I just completed a round trip from Missouri to the Great Smoky Mtns. of Tennessee and I guess my expectations were to high for my vacation week.The volume has to be set too high to hear Alexa over the vehicle speakers.",2,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"The good: The echo only required power, the audio cord was not needed.  Plays music and auto resumes where it left off when I start my next trip.  Songs can be controlled by voice or on my cars touchscreen.  Seeing the song and artist on the cars display and advancing to the next song using the car's controls is very slick. Voice navigation is good with google maps.  Reads text messages on command.  Reads the current news, albeit liberal NPR.The bad: There is a lag time for interactive conversations with Alexa.  This makes some tasks impossible.  For example composing a text message did not work, after many attempts I gave up on it.  Sometimes it will hear its own messages and use them for the reply.  Does not work with Spotify, very frustrating, keeps sending me to the play store to install the already installed app.  Frequently, creates a new playlist instead of adding songs to the requested list.",1,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"Alexa auto is great for streaming Amazon music, but seriously lacks when it comes to navigation. You really end up spending more time messing with your phone in order to get Alexa Auto to get you to your destination, which defeats the ""hands free""  Pairing was super simple and although my car (2017 Malibu) is listed as one not bluetooth compatible, it was the only way I could connect to Alexa Auto. I am holding out hope that Amazon will get better with the navigation portion of Alexa Auto (the reason I bought it). If you have the Amazon Music app and a bluetooth radio, there really is no need for this device.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"So far this device has been okay for basic things like calling someone or getting google map directions. A couple things that irk me is that if I’m on the phone when I start my car and connect to Bluetooth and this device, Alexa starts talking to me and telling me about the phone call features, so it completely interrupts the phone call I’m on and I can’t get her to stop talking.Secondly, I drive cross country a lot and even though I’ve downloaded audiobooks or whatever to my phone, if I have something playing via Alexa it cuts out when I lose phone service. Even though the item was downloaded and the Echo Auto and my phone are connected via Bluetooth.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"Not at all what I expected. The auto echo didn’t work unless my phone was plugged in to the USB.  Siri was able to answer questions that Alexa couldn’t. The only feature that is good is being able to drop in to devices at home while In the car. The placement in to the car vents is also not great. It blocks AC flow, you can’t turn the vents if the echo is on it. There should be some other way to keep it, maybe on visor or mirror or cup holder stand. The power cord having to plug in to the cigarette lighter is also not great. It would be better if the device could be on battery so there is more flexibility on where to place it.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"To begin I have an older 2010 Suburban.  It does have Bluetooth for voice only.  Now, the Echo Auto does a decent job having my phone call, and use the truck for the voice.  It even does a decent job doing other small things like navigation etc.  Admittedly the audio is way better when playing Amazon Music etc through the echo Auto rather than using the traditional input cableMy biggest problem is connectivity to my phones.  I have had this issue with the Pixel XL and XL2.  Where in order for the Echo Auto to connect Ihave to reboot my phone as it loses connection to Alexa, even with the application open.  This happens about every third time I get into the vehicle consistently, and sometimes while driving and in the middle of operation.  Admittedly I do unplug the Echo Auto each time I exit the vehicle.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"When I bought this under the ""invite only"" program (which took a year) it was $25. Now that it's available to the public, it's $50. As a $25 product, it's totally worth it. I question the price point now. I would have recommended it before, but now I can't. My other nit with Amazon is they limit 3rd party Alexa integrators such as Garmin, iOttie, Anker, Nextbase, etc. from using Apple Music and Spotify. You're pretty much limited to Amazon Music.Despite the 2X pricing, the unfair business practices with 3rd party developers, it's a great product. It works really well. Way better than having to yell at Siri (which barely works), then having to wait for her to respond, then ask the question. With Alexa Echo in your car, you just treat it like you do at home.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"Overall I have been happy with this. My state recently passed a hands off phone law, which complicated a few things that I need my phone for while driving.  I love being able to control my amazon music through the phone. Sometimes I have to repeat myself twice to get it to do what I want for music instead of confirming then playing nothing. But the biggest feature I love about this is the skills, specifically the ability to use skills that help type 1 diabetes management. I am the caregiver of a child with Type 1 and I can ask Alexa using a skill what my child’s blood sugar is and she will respond with the number and the rate of change. All while not taking my eyes off the road.I use the vent attachment and it holds very securely. The cord management on the Alexa holder is clever, but my cord still pops out occasionally. It’s not a deal breaker, but it can be annoying at times.",4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

After a week I would try to ask a question, its' listening but it wont answer. I want to like it and keep it. I'm hoping that it will start to work better . I have been using this device for a few months.  I don't think it's a good Alexa product.  It stops working alot. I wish that o could give it 5 stars.

Let me start this review by letting you know up front that the Amazon Echo Auto really can’t do anything that your smartphone “assistant” can’t already do.  The only thing that the Amazon Echo Auto raises the bar on is how well it hears what you’re saying.  At $49.99 I do not recommend wasting your money on it until Amazon further refines what it can do and make it something that isn’t just piggybacking on your phone.If you are interested in seeing a full video review of the Amazon Echo Auto you can go to my YouTube channel by searching Unbox Talks and finding my video on the Amazon Echo Auto.  You can also find plenty of other reviews for other products on Unbox Talks as well which will give you a finer look on video of may items.,1,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"I have been driving quite a bit recently and I listen to satellite radio, music and Kindle audio books. Fumbling with the phone while driving is unsafe so I was looking for a way to switch between these audio sources. Unfortunately, the Echo Auto often disconnects and needs to be re-paired with my iPhone each time. That's way too much hassle for a device designed to make things easier in the car.It is worth noting that:",3,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"At first, it seemed to work great. I was able to get up and running in just a few minutes with the included instructions and app setup routine. I was able to ask Alexa to play music and it played what I wanted. However after a few days of use, some fundamental problems became apparent. The Alexa app would be unable to connect to the Echo Auto, and it would require rerunning the whole setup,routine to reconnect. This became more and more frequent as time went on. In addition, voice recognition is it or miss. Navigation doesn’t work at all. So, although it is a good concept and shows potential, it isn’t yet ready for regular in-car use.",2,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"First let me say I love my Alexa devices, my home ones anyway. The Alexa Auto is a good product and eventually I feel it will be on the same level as the home models. There are some bugs that need worked out, or with my vehicles sound system anyway. When I'm playing music and have Alexa do a task it puts my stereo into pause mode and will not resume after Alexa completes the task. I have noticed if there is a lot of road noise Alexa has a hard time understanding me and has occasionally done something other than what I asked. I think eventually these bugs will be worked out but right now there are some issues.",3,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

Saying “that sucks” ended up setting it off at first, but hasn’t done it since the third road trip. 2) The audio for calls is a lot lower than the music.

I have Amazon Unlimited Music and love love love this.  I purchased one for me and two of them for my kids we all love it.  We have had ours going on 10 months.  The only issue I have and its not the auto echo's fault my sync stops working in my car and I have to pull the fuse out and insert back in.  This would do that when I was just using my phone.  Ive had no problems with the Auto Echo and plays great and with the Prime unlimited I can set up several playlist and my granddaughter and I will be on trips and use it every single mile.

"Not a hands free control of your phone, but a mobile use of Alexa. You can't control apps or information from your phone. For example, if you ask it to play an audio book from audible, it starts playing it via the Internet like it would in your home. That's ok for home because of Wifi, but while in my car, the data connection from my phone is being used and sapping data. But what is more disappointing is that the book is in the Audible app on my phone so it could play from there. Secondly, the bluetooth is with the phone directly and not the car sound system. So my phone has to be hooked to the sound system. I was hoping this would bypass that, especially since it has an Aux out. Lastly, the small rubber cable management piece fell off from the heat of being in the car after only a few days. I'm going to keep it to have an Echo in my RV when I'm parked....but mobile, I'm better off just saying ""Hey Siri"".",3,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
As someone who doesnt have any bluetooth or nice electronics in my car this is a great little device for going hands free to play my music and get directions... when it works. If it boots up right away it will work till you try and give it another command as which point it was disconnect for a while and keep trying to find your phone. After what feels like forever it will reconnect and you'll have to restart directions and songs.I was a member of the beta and I did enjoy this and love it when it was working.

"My problems with this product may be mine alone, but I had great hopes for it and have been disappointed.  I have a 2015 Subaru Forester and an iPhone 6, and I have had major problems getting this Alexa device to connect properly.  I finally had to buy a dedicated Bluetooth receiver and that didn't really solve the problem.  If there's anything dicey with the phone or the Alexa device or the Alexa app or the car's Bluetooth, then the whole system falls apart.  It is extraordinarily fussy.  It was easy to set up the first time and fabulous when it's all connected, but the continuous logging in and logging out and reinstalling and reconnecting makes the device basically unusable for me.

I don't like having in on the air vent because it can be seen and attract burglars. The only complaint I have is when I'm on a call, the device turns green. I don't know if it's listening but it's slightly concerning. It's more useful then a pain and because it's doing what I want it to do, I'm content.",3,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

It takes a few minutes to activate the wi-fi when I turn it on in the car.  After the connection is made it runs with little problem.

As such, I could just as easily use the Alexa app instead.  I can't really see the point of another device to worry about that doesn't have any unique function.If it had the capability to work through the Alexa app on a laptop, it might be more useful as ""Alexa Mobile"", but even then the app would probably suffice.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

People were jumping out of their cars and trying to figure out where to run, when there was nowhere TO run...we could see the tornado that leveled the town about a mile to the south).  Now I just say, ""Alexa, what's the weather?"" if I'm on the road and there's a bad cloud ahead.  Alexa lets me know if it's just rain, or if I should pull off the next exit and find a building.  That means a lot when you've been sitting there watching a construction crane rock from side to side on a bridge that is being rebuilt, and you wonder if you'll die from the fall as the bridge collapses, drown in the river below you, or when your car is carried away and wrapped around a tree.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0

"Initial connectivity with my car and phone was not possible without being on my home WiFi network.  Perhaps this is how it was designed to work, but I didn't see anything about that in the instructions.  Unfortunately, ""initial connectivity"" includes everyday startup as well as first setup.  If I'm not at home on the WiFi when I start my car, there's no communicating with Alexa Auto.  It seems to be a daily struggle, occasionally involving pulling off the road because I don't automatically open the Alexa app every morning, to get the unit responding and some mornings I just don't have the time and after a few days I didn't have the desire.  If you have an iPhone, it's easier to say ""Hey Siri"".Alexa Auto is an expensive proposition if you don't have an unlimited data plan on your phone because all it seems to do is stream data from your phone.  I have a Sirius satellite subscription built into my car's audio system but Alexa Auto is unable to do anything with it, as I discovered after a few hours of listening when I got a data warning from my provider.  It can provide directions, but so can Siri without the hassles of trying to get Alexa Auto up and running (and Waze does it better than either of them).

I never have this problem with ""Echo"" at home.  It functions as a perfectly good Bluetooth to AUX cord conversion, but that's about it. It's music controls are extremely limited, and it isn't helpful for navigation at all.

I can ask what the weather is, how long until I get home, play this music or that.  It really adds a new level of depth to my drive home.What would be better, and I know it is tough because of all the different companies, would be to allow Alexa to seamlessly work with Google Music.

Sometimes it won't sync with my car, or my phone and then it's useless.  Also, I hate all car accessories that attach to your air vents.  It's the worst place to attach something.  If it actually fits, it will likely break the vent over time, and in the meantime you loose most function of that vent.  Worst idea ever. Surprised Amazon didn't come up with a better design on this.  I would have at least hoped for a mount that can stick onto your dash with adhesive.The risk of being an early adopter.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"Finally! Bluetooth connectivity for phone calls, music, etc. in my 2005 Camry, using a cassette adapter I had stashed in my glove box. Disappointed that I can’t tell Alexa to open my Chamberlain garage door, but that’s because Chamberlain wants me to pay them $10 a month to add Alexa to my already web enabled garage door. I took a star off the rating because I still have to pick up my phone to do things like google maps, make phone calls and still no way to read texts. However, I’m enjoying games, music and BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY for phone calls and using car speakers for listening. Easy to set up, inexpensive for all the capabilities.

My frustration is that nearly every time I start my car it loses it's connection to my iPhone. Then I have to go through a process to re-establish the connection. This is not acceptable. I was so frustrated with this repeated disconnection that I've retired this item to my glove compartment in the hope that a future firmware or other software fix will get it to work reliable.

"I received this from my insurance company (Nationwide) for free and have been using it for just under a month. I just got home from my first road trip with it, so I thought it was time for a review. This is the first “Alexa” product I’ve had, so I was curious if it was compatible with my southern accent…it is! I love being able to switch from playlists to podcasts hands-free as well as pausing and restarting them as needed. As long as I open the Alexa app on my phone the first time getting in my car for the day, there aren’t really any connection issues. (Except for when you are at the end of your home wifi range…you do lose connection for a few minutes). It did great hearing me through road noise and with the music up loud. I only gave 4 stars, because I do think there are a few improvements that need to be made:1.)  I dislike the cords. My car only has Bluetooth for phone calls, so I have to use the power cord and the aux cord. It’s pretty annoying to have two cords hanging from the dash, so a rechargeable device would be ideal with a shorter aux cord.",4,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

I can add appointments to my calendar, add to my shopping list, listen to music I like and get directions in my car. Super.

I’ve been talking with tune in and am waiting on a fix. The only caveat is that if your phone is on WiFi it’ll cause some interruptions from LTE/WiFi migrations so I recommend turning WiFi off and giving it a few minutes to connect before barking orders.

"I'm using my echo auto in my 2013 Ram 1500. My head unit is a Pioneer AVH-200EX. I found myself yelling my wake/commands to the unit as it is not able to hear good. This tends to be a bit inconvenient and/or comedic when I'm with other passengers as I'm belting out ""Alexa, Alexa, Play ...."".  Also, reconnecting to the echo has not been consistent, especially driving around town having to get in and out of the truck, both leaving the vehicle on or turning the vehicle off and on.  I usually have to get into my Bluetooth setting and reconnect it. Finally, it would be great if it had an internal rechargeable battery as it would have better portability plus I would love to keep my console clean and simple. Overall, it is a wonderful unit to have as a feature in my vehicle.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"First things first - I love the Echo devices. I have a Spot and a Dot at home and use them all the time. But the Echo Auto is inconsistent to the point that I've stopped really using it. It takes too long to respond to queries, often it'll cut off listening mid sentence, and the requirement to be connected to the Alexa app means if the app leaves foreground for a millisecond, it loses connectivity. And this happens all. the. time. It pretty much defeats the object if while driving I'm fiddling around to re-open the Alexa app on my phone just so Echo Auto can reconnect.Waste of money right now, the only saving grace was I paid nearly nothing for it due to discounts, else I'd be mad at the cost. Maybe a few firmware updates will make it better, but for now, avoid this.",2,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0

Then, someone else in the car needs to take my phone, open the Alexa app and re-establish a blue-tooth connection to the Alexa device.

"I was invited to purchase Echo Auto for $25 before it opened to the world for $50. I can't speak to IOS/Apple as I have a Samsung Galaxy and use Android Auto. Android Auto (plus my phone) is not fully baked, but when it is, it should be able to do everything Echo does. So Echo Auto is basically a voice activated interface that creates the same Echo experience you have at home. For that it is good (road trips w/Kids for example). However, it uses your Phone as the engine and the Echo widget app actually already makes your phone and Echo Tap. This just adds the voice activation. If you have Amazon Unlimited, that's OK for $25 but not for $50. I think improvements in Car/Phone technology will make this obsolete in ~1-2 years.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Though this was an okay addition to my vehicle due to not having Android Auto or Apple Car Play, it lacks options.  First the design is flawed, specifically the mount.  Due to the need to mount it to a vent.  All makes and models of vehicles have vents, but they are all different and this mount is not sustainable and made of cheap material.  I am disappointed that there is not an optional mount like a suction cup for the windshield or a weighted version for the dash.  I even saw that Iottie makes an Alexa induction cell phone charger holder with a suction mount that looks like a better option.  Second issue is the cord organizer.  I have 2 Alexa Autos and both of the mounts cord organizers fell off.  What is the point of adding a cord organizer that does not stay on the device it was meant to support? I would love to see a cordless version that can have some versatility and mount anywhere you want it within speaking range.  With all of the technology out there how come it was not made rechargeable?  By and large I enjoy using Alexa products but there is always room for improvement.",3,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0

If I open the alexa app, sometimes itll just work, and sometimes itll say something went wrong, and frequently itll just reboot the Auto. In fact the Auto just reboots randomly during longer trips for no reason causing me to start this over. So many issues, it clearly wasnt ready for release.",2,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"We used to have satellite radios in our vehicle but when we purchased a used vehicle, it wasn’t part of the package. We thought we’d try the Echo Auto and we are delighted with it.  Clear sound and great voice recognition. A good cell connection is essential. Periodically there can be a slight delay between speaking and Alexa recognizing your speech. I have an idea that the cell connection at these times is not as good.Love the option of using AUX or Bluetooth as our vehicle also didn’t have Bluetooth. Now I can answer calls hands free again with the Echo Auto. We are delighted.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
I had been really looking forward to getting the Echo Auto and it doesn't disappoint! It's so convenient to have music and books voice ready but the real features for me are LISTS and REMINDERS.  I'm forever thinking of things while I drive that I used to have to voice to text in either Messages or Keep but now I can use Alexa. Way easier and less dangerous. Bonus points for being able to play Jeopardy and other games in the car.  Occasionally there are issues with voice recognition but it's a minor thing compared to the benefit and people griping about not having immediate connection need to be realistic. It does take a a minute for my phone to disconnect from the house wifi and over to 4G but that's not on the Echo and by the time I leave my development it's set to go. There's always room for improvement but overall I love it - can't wait to road trip with Echo for Christmas.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,1

I am an Amazon music subscriber and also have apple CarPlay in the car.  I used to access amazon music via my iPhone via CarPlay but since i installed this, its made asking for and listening to music so much easier.  Best part is I don’t have to keep plugging my cell phone into the cars USB.  Echo connects via the phones Bluetooth seamlessly and connects quickly.

If I had an older car that did not hook up to my phone, maybe this would be ideal.

The pros of having the auto echo alexa in your car is that it allows you to listen to anything while driving . You can have Alexa repeat (well tell her to go back to repeat a song) and/or skip a song. Ask her anything you would with the one you may have in your house...BUT the cons out ways the pros for me as I have a small voice and it takes a few shouts for her to hear me often times I have to volume down for her to hear the request.I also think Amazon should figure out away to build in the wi-fi into the echo and have you pay a small monthly fee for it. As to use my data often drains the life of my phone. ONE LAST thing it pauses too much in between songs and often times you lose the connection and or it switches to the next song without your request to do so.,4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto is an amazing device to have. You see I have an 08 MB R350. If you anything about MB you know adding any extra features is $$$$. With the Echo Auto I don’t have to order or upgrade anything for my car. You can plug it in the the Aux port and have instant Bluetooth. Not just any kind of Bluetooth but Bluetooth with ALEXA!!! The Bluetooth adapter for my car is 299,00 to put in another radio that will match the MB luxury would be around 700 and up. This cost me 34.99 plus tax didn’t have to swap my radio, or buy any adapters because everything you need is in the box. The audio is crystal clear, and there is no lag when watching videos I repeat NO LAG!!!! Thank God! There’s nothing worse than watching a video and the Audio doesn’t match up. You can watch YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, you name it and it will play through this device. Phone calls you can answer hands free by just saying “ Alexa pick up phone “ you can turn on your lights at home if you have those, set reminders, make a shopping list, basically just about whatever you need to do you can. I have the Echo Show, Echo 2nd Gen, and I can drop in at home right from my car. Anyway enough rambling you should pick one up and give it a try. Even if you have Bluetooth already in your car this will be a great addition. You won’t even barely have to touch your phone while driving around. Oh I also drive rideshare.

Pros: Love the hands free quality and integration with car and phone. Navigation search is way better than the one that my car has. Great to play my music and create reminders in car. Excellent price for what you get. I've recommended it to several people. Apple or Android auto may negate the need for this but I don't have those in my 2016 car.  Cons: you do need Bluetooth that does media not just phone calls. Probably not good if you don't have unlimited data on phone.

The sleek design does allow you to hide the device in the center console and with the sensitivity of the mics, it works well even with the center console covers closed. The reaction time is equivocal to other Alexa devices, maybe 1-2 seconds longer. Connecting to your phone when you enter your car may take a bit so don’t expect it to be completely ready when you initially enter the car. It connects automatically to your phone so you don’t need to worry about turning on the app which is pretty smooth. The device does have shiny pretty LED lights like all Alexa devices and would potentially look pretty cool of you display it on the dashboard, however due to the chunk USB plug design it makes hiding the cord even with the mount a little hard and cosmetically displeasing if you’re mounting it so I opt to place it in the console.

"So I was expecting basically an Echo Input that connects to your phone for internet connectivity. Instead this device is a weird in-between for your phone and your car.

On top of that it often loses the connection to your phone because it only works while the Alexa app is running in the background. I recommend waiting for something better.",3,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

None of the instructions said you could ask Alexa to text people, but it DOES...It even made an update recently that reads my text back before i send it.  Recently it had been acting up some,  but i resisted my phone and it is working fine again.For connecting to directions...it instantly opens Google maps with directions when i ask for directions.  Sometimes it doesn't hear my words perfect which can be frustrating,  but overall i have been able to overlook some of the issues because it works for my texting,  listening to music,  podcasts, and giving me all my news briefings.

"I waited forever for this to finally be released.  I have several Alexa enabled devices and really looked forward to having one for my car as well.  I feel like I'm still waiting.... It almost never works.  In the almost three months I have had it, it has only worked correctly ONCE, and that is trying it multiple times a day.  The majority of the time it says ""I am having trouble connecting...please try again later."" Asking it to dial/call someone will result in getting someone not even remotely close to what you asked for (asked for 'Kim'...dialed 'Steve') and good luck getting music.  At best, when it finally will play something, it's usually just one song and then stops, and you have to start the whole process over again (repeatedly telling it what you want until it gets it right...)  The one thing that it has performed ok is adding something to a list...shopping, to do, etc.  So if that's all you want it for, then you shouldn't be too disappointed.",1,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0

I can tell it to turn on my lights in my house from 30 miles away and I don't have to enter a dark home YIPEE!

Once it kept connecting at a ballgame that I was at over 300 feet away!! That was annoying. So I have to disconnect every time I leave the truck. It also doesn’t auto reconnect when I turn Bluetooth back on when I get back in to drive.

All hands free! Previously when listening to podcasts, i would think ""hmm..that's really interesting, ill look it up later"" but would forget it. Not anymore! Thanks Echo!

My biggest gripe, and also the main reason I bought this thing, was it's supposed ability to jive with google maps. For reasons my blood pressure won't allow me to address, I found navigating through Echo to be virtually impossible.

"So I've been using for a few weeks now.  I made play lists for my Amazon Music.  Found I had to repeat myself, then gave up and renamed play lists to x playlist for Alexa to understand.  Then there's the sending of a simple text.  That was the reason for giving the poor voice recognition.  Alexa would give up the process.  A simple text to my wife of ""leaving now"" would be given up on sending.  Simple things like weather and tell me a joke work fine.  But over all I would agree with others that call it in a beta stage.  Initial setup was also painful.  Best to realize that you still set your car to bluetooth phone, then the mic part attaches bluetooth to the alexa auto device.  Lastly, I had a hour long drive to a remote location.  Worked great the whole way there,  but my battery on my phone drained and I was out for the drive back.  So best to plug your phone and the Alexa in while driving.

I received this unit through a promotion from Nationwide Insurance, and I'm glad I did not pay $$$ for it, however I could probably get more benefits from the Echo Auto if I spent more time learning how to set it up and use it.

"I drive an older car that only supported Bluetooth calling but using those atrocious voice tags of your voice saying someone's name. My main goal with purchasing this device was to upgrade my Bluetooth to be able to be media compatible so I could do away with the aux cord and having to pull my phone out of my pocket every time to do so. In that regard, this device delivers fantastically with a simple ""Hey Alexa play my music on Spotify"" and as an added bonus I deleted all my old voice tags and can use Alexa to make calls from my phone book. Pretty sweet upgrade and as I was invited to purchase the device early, the price I paid was a steal for such an easy upgrade.Now the downsides. I have one of the few cars in existence that apparently isn't compatible with the vent mount. No big deal, just mutilated the magnet mount a bit and attached it with the proper automotive adhesive. Problems solved... except my aux port is also in the armrest so I had to get a longer cable that required management. Alexa herself is useful for those ""Alexa to call John Smith"" command you want to do on the fly but is hugely lacking in the ability to do any sort of complex command such as ""Alexa take me to Generic Name Elementary"". Instead, she will just go rogue and route you to the nearest random school, restaurant, etc of what type of place you asked for which at this point is rather disappointing.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

In just a couple of days, it's already mysteriously lost connection to the app, requiring me to pull over and restart the app on my phone.  The app has also managed to play output from the phone instead of over the car receiver.

I love the concept and it does work great for music and outgoing calls.  It also does a satisfactory job with navigation.  It was real easy to setup.

I have unlimited data on my cellphone plan so I don’t worry about using data with this product.  If you do not have unlimited data make sure you not breaking the bank.  The one glaring problem is that you can not answer incoming calls unless it is an Alexa to Alexa call.  If someone is calling from a cell or landline you can not have echo answer it.  If they can fix this then the echo auto would get a five star review from me.  As it is I have to hook up the external Bluetooth I had previously to answer the calls.  I just hope they can be both connected.,3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

Furthermore, the music notification pops up in my notification bar for hours after leaving my vehicle no matter how many times I swipe to dismiss.

The USB and audio port locations make the whole device look very tacky when installed with the included mounting solution. The only thing I would like to use it for is maybe speech to text messages however, the implementation for this feature is irritating to use. I dislike the inclusion of a voice recording with the text message and there is not any option to disable this. All I want is the text itself, the added recording is redundant and from my experience poor quality because of the added road noise. Additionally, the option to chance the wake word from ""Alexa"" to something else would be nice, I really do not like saying Alexa.In the end I will probably dismantle it and salvage components for electronic projects.

She can't find music that I listen to EVERY DAY, and is in my purchased Amazon Music. When I stop my  car so I can start the music from my Amazon Music App, and ask Alexa (Auto) what is playing, she knows the name of the song then - but ask for the same song by name? She can't find it. Her favorite phrase is ""sorry, I don't know that"". Unfortunately, I've been cussing her out a lot lately, but I'm so frustrated.",2,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I have an older model car with no bluetooth, but with a AUX in jack to the factory stereo.  I had an older bluetooth adapter, which this replaced.  It is much better, since it does not need charging.  I stream live radio shows when I am out of radio reception range, and play downloaded podcasts.  No problems with either.  Only downside is I have to unplug the USB when not in use to avoid car radio switching to AUX automatically, even when there is no Echo Auto audio signal. Since I'm not a fan of Alexa, I disabled the microphone, but may set up some hands-free tasks in the future if I have time.",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I love amazon and have many echos. I've purchased echo's for friends and family. We all love amazon and ring. This has transformed our life. I was excited about this device and it easily set up. My phone must be close to the device in order for it to work. I have to pick up the device and scream into it for it to sometimes recognize me. It's as if it was made by someone other than Amazon. It's horrendous and I cannot recommend it. Use the Amazon app on your phone and stream music to your car. That works awesomely well. This, does not. It's as if it has inferior mic's or something.",1,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"I really don't understand the negative reviews, but I had no problems setting the device up or using it.  It responds well and acts just like an echo in the home.  I guess I will point out that I paired it in my house before going to my car, perhaps that made the experience easier as I just connected to my home wifi.  I imagine there is an issue if you have an older phone that has lower performance.  This item functions as an extension of the phone app, and it appears that  your phone performance (or lack there of) could be an issue.  So its my guess that many of the negative reviews are due to people with crappy phones.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
I already pay for Amazon Music and getting Alexa for Auto replaced my need for SIRIUS/XM who kept jacking up their rates. The voice control works great. Being able to Alexa control lights inside my home as I pull up in the driveway is terrific.Now that these Alexa Autos are widely available I'm going to buy another for my wife's car and cancel SIRIUS altogether.,4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,1

"For starters, this is the worst device that Amazon has ever made. Not only does it clutter your car with cords, it just doesn't work. Bluetooth would cut out or just not connect. I'd have to spend 5 minutes every time I got in the car trying to get it to work. The device would never understand me when I spoke or just not hear me at all, even with zero noise inside the car from fans, etc. Then I started getting prompts from my Amazon Alexa app that I could use that app instead of needing another device. So why did I just spend money on the Echo Auto when all you really need is the Amazon Echo App? Waste of money and too much hassle. It now sits in my glove box, hopefully waiting for an update that fixes some of the voice recognition issues.",1,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I initially did'd this Echo Auto resulting in a call from Amazon Support asking if I needed additional help setting up.  Well, I am fairly technical and thought I would give it another try.  I installed an Echo auto to both of my family's vehicles and have spend the last several weeks using the Auto for audible, podcasts, music, news, direction for a short trip I took, etc.  I have to tell you that I like it a lot.  Its integration with the map app could be better, I currently have to manually open the map application, but it is a pure voice-driven entertainment provider.  Its a keeper for me.",4,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"I love amazon products but I am not a fan of the Amazon Auto. I had hoped that it would not be so obvious in the car. I don't like seeing the power cable hanging down and it is not long enough where I could mount it on the top of my windshield and hide it like I do with my dash cam. The vent mount is not convenient either, one size does not fit all. Amazon should have done something similar to the Roav Viva. I think  Roav did a better job of offering in vehicle alexa without being visually intrusive and at the same time offering more functionality, two USB outlets (See photo). I also don't like the fact the Amazon Auto does not allow me to open my garage, even with my pin code. And it does not allow me to choose my GPS app for navigation, I am stuck with Apple's built-in maps which I don't think anybody use, certainly not me. Hopefully they will improve the next generation. I am returning.",3,1,2019-10-15,1,0,1
"I will confess setup was not as smooth as it could have been. It's a tad more complicated than an echo speaker, but the payoff is tremendous. Truly. Alexa in my car takes hands free to a whole new level. It seemlessly integrates both with my phone's functions and my car's. I drive a Ford C-Max Energi and use a Pixel 3a. I love that she wakes up as soon as I open my car door, letting me know she's there and ready, although once in a while she won't automatically be available and I have to tap the little button in top to wake her up, but then she's back to it. So the only things I think need improvement are that and making set up easier. Other than that, I FREAKING LOVE my echo auto!",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

Lets also talk about the annoying wire that hangs down from the vent clip and how they could have at least figured out how to make it wireless. Finally the biggest problem: turned off the car, ran into Target,  started the car back up, and it doesn't work. We tried everything,  but it wouldn't connect.  It wouldn't even turn on.

This happens especially when playing some of the trivia games that Alexa offers. It can be a bit frustrating using my phone's GPS and the Echo Auto at the same time. Every time my GPS gives a command the Echo has to stop and then start again. I went so far as to have the GPS commands play on my phone instead of through Bluetooth, but that doesn't change the Echo's behavior. Overall, I love the device.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,1,0
I absolutely love my Alexa auto. I have all the Alexa products and I am so used to asking anything that pops in my head. I used to be lost in my car without her. Not anymore! We now opt to take my car on all the long trips or we take Alexa out and put it in whatever we are taking. Alexa reads all my ebooks to me and the radio stations are all commercial free and unlimited skips. I did switch cell phone providers not just for Alexa but to ensure the best service while driving.

"I really really wanted to love this product, being a big fan of Amazon products, but this one was a total flop. I was so stoked about getting early access and having hands-free entertainment on my traffic-y drive to work (pretending I'm good at jeopardy :p), but was completely let down by how poorly this product works. The sound quality is fine... as it uses my car's speakers... but just about everything else is pretty terrible. I literally had to scream at Alexa in order to get her to respond, and by maybe the 5th attempt I'd get a ""I am having trouble connecting to the internet. Take a look at the help section in your Alexa app."" Even on 10 minute drives (in areas that I know I have cellular service) the echo auto couldn't manage to stay connected. I would have to go into the app and click “I'm a passenger” 5+ times, which completely defeats the purpose of being ""hands-free"". I'm honestly not sure how this product passed the testing stage.",1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I liked that Alexa car can do same things as my echo devices at home, but the bad thing is that it takes over as the audio source in the vehicle.  This means that if your phone rings, you now have to pick up your phone as it will not go through your car speakers as they are routed through the echo device.  You cannot use your radio as it will only allow audio through the Amazon device.  It therefore is not very useful in the car.

If you have an iPhone though, Siri can already do all of these things, so it's not really so useful. It may also be redundant if you have an Android Phone and using ""Hey Google.""

I have to call the device several times before I get a response and even then there is a 3 to 5sec delay.  On my Echo Show and other devices I say Alexa and receive a response immediately.

I can control my devices at home and send messages to the family at command.

And every time we get in the car it’s RANDOM who’s phone it connects to IF it connects. Constant “I can’t do that right now. I’m not connected to the internet” issues . Great idea, HOPE it gets fixed, but it should be offered with the ability to hardwire and use ApplePlay same time as amazon Alexa app!

It's an upgrade in an area that is prominently filled with bad voice control options in your vehicle. It comes with a big learning curve for use.Now the bad. The bluetooth has a delay. So its extremely frustrating when trying to interact with Alexa. You use the wake word, and it will ""beep"" half way during the command.

It’s super annoying. Every once in awhile she’ll say she’s not connected to the internet.  I haven’t tried anything else with it because I use Waze for maps.  I’m really not impressed at all. The mount is horrible and it doesn’t work. I just have it laying in a cubby hole. You can’t fast forward to the next song with your car buttons so u might as well just open it in amazon music before driving.  I feel cheated out of $30.

"I have a 2019 4Runner without Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. I wanted a device that would improve the voice control of my vehicle’s entertainment system, as the native system has limited app interaction. The Echo Auto IS an upgrade in that regard, although it’s in need of improvement in the future. The voice recognition is good, but not as accurate as my echo dots at home are. It may be the road noise, but I have to focus on enunciation for longer or more complicated song titles (for example). I’ve also noticed that it sometimes has trouble switching between streaming services, especially when going from Amazon Music to Spotify. The device itself looks good, and I appreciate that it’s on a magnetic dock so you can easily put it in the center console if you’re not in a great area. The bracket itself is well designed, though you do need to mount it in a vent, so it’s a good idea to turn the air to that off. The power cord is a little messy, and the cord management plug that’s glued to the bracket fell off, but those aren’t enough for me not to recommend the product. OVERALL: The Echo Auto HAS successfully kept my phone out of my hands while driving. I’m extremely pleased and safer because of it; thank you, Amazon.

Now it actually looks like part of the vehicle.",3,1,2019-10-13,1,0,1
"I received this for free, with a credit from my insurance company. It seems to work well, but it just turned into more of a pain that it was worth. I had to mount it on my air vent, then run a cord to the power socket. There goes a clean look in the truck. For audio and such, it hooks up to the stereo via bluetooth. What I found after about two weeks of use is that it does nothing that my phone does not already do. Honestly, it's almost 2020, and most of us have a virtual assistant on our phones anyways, whether it be Google Assistant, Siri, or whatever. I just found that there was nothing it could do that my Google Assistant couldn't. It was just conflicting assistants, another app to download, and stuff strung across my truck.",2,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"Sí, es verdad! es la primera vez que me arrepiento de haber comprado un producto de Amazon, no es funcional, trae demasiados cables, el soporte es con adhesivos. No me quejaré mucho de que sólo viene con un sólo idioma porque lo daba por sentado, sin embargo el reconocimiento de voz no es para nada bueno. De modo que volví a mi viejo manos libres de Motorla y el Echo Auto está guardado en algún lugar de la cochera....",1,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0
"While the cellphone Alexa app can be used while driving down the highway, it's a lot more convenient to just speak up, like you do at home, and accomplish tasks without taking your eyes off the road or a hand off the steering wheel. We live out in the country, with a locked gate, and it's quite a ways from there to the house. While my wife opens & closes the gate, I generally tell Alexa I'm home and I tell her to turn on the back porch lights. (We had a little hiccup with the first unit but Amazon immediately contacted me, when they learned of it, and a replacement Echo Auto was promptly sent to replace it.)",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
I was heisting buying this due to some negative reviews. I have an alexa echo and show. I recently got a larger car and that meant I gave up my Bluetooth. I’m use to hands free music and calls so I didn’t want to go back. The alexa is perfect for me! I put it in the aux outlet and plugged it in and it was ready to go. Some reviews said set up was difficult. Mine took no time at all. Other reviews complaint where that the cables too long. I ordered a 6inch micro usb and aux cable and stuck it to the car with 3m double sided tape. I didn’t want to use the air vent attachments or the cables would be everywhere. This Alexa auto works just like my alexa dot.,5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,1
"Initial setup was a bit of a challenge.  However, it works really well once you get the setup down.  A lot of people don’t seem to like the power cord.  What’s the other option? A rechargeable battery?  I like that I never have to worry about a battery running out of power, and I never have to take the Echo auto out of the car to charge it in the house.It works well for hands free voice interaction, just like having Alexa in the car...will give sport scores and other information.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,1,0
"So my initial thoughts were that of excitement to have Alexa in the car.  Then to realize that I always had her all along on my phone anyway.  Then I thought yeah but this connects through the sound system and will work hands free!  ""Then to realize...."", you get the point.  So what am I missing, what does echo auto do that the phone we are using to connect echo auto with does not already do?  I would love to think there is something I'm missing that will make it worth having.  Some points of interest, I think the design of the device is great, small profile and easy to install!  Not sure if this is phone or echo auto but it looses connection with phone often.  I would recommend that future versions of the device come with the blue light currently on one side be changed to either on top where buttons are or on both sides.  Currently you can not tell if shes listening unless you can see the moving side light.  This is problematic if you are driving or have the device installed in a way that does not afford viewing of that side of the device.  I like the idea of it all ,but I'm gonna give it some time to figure out I think.",3,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"This does exactly what I wanted it to do. Since my car doesn't have bluetooth I was looking for a option for connecting my phone without having to plug-in an accessory cord every time I got in and then flipping through the phone while driving to change songs make calls and open Maps. It has worked perfectly for this. Set up was easy, I just followed the instructions step by step and had it set up pretty quickly. It hears my voice even when the music is turned up. Sometimes I have to repeat myself, however I do have a slight stutter so even my Echo Show gives me the same problem. Not sure I would need it if my car had bluetooth, but I do like the voice command so maybe it would still be useful in that case.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I received a free Echo Auto as a promotion from Nationwide and have absolutely enjoyed it. I can play music, ask about the weather, play skills, and much more.

Another great skill is the ability to use Audible without having the app on my phone to take up space.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0
"I purchased this for $25 as part of the beta program.  For that price, I think I got a fair deal, and have enjoyed playing with the device.

"I got the echo auto when it was invitation only , and I like it. Even though I have a after market Pioneer stereo in my car everything connects fine via Bluetooth. I really like the fact everything is hands free, when I want to hear certain music, make a phone call, or even ask for directions. The cool thing is that it connect to the Alexa app. in which connect to the phone book on your phone as well as google maps and other apps. so all I have to do is simply say Alexa take me to the nearest Starbucks or give me directions to a certain address and rite away my google maps pop up on my phone. Also if you are like me and have a password to unlock your phone the Alexa app. will ask if they can automatically unlock your phone only when you are in the car with echo auto and once you step out of the car you automatically goes back to password mode. I thought that is a coll feature . The only thing is that sometimes you have to yell at Alexa so she can hear you... All in All it is a really cool device...",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"Integration: Device has no option to connect to my vehicle’s WiFi and unlimited data plan. Only works through my phone and its limited data plan. I think I’d rather put a real Echo in my car. Additionally, since I have Apple Car Play and Android Auto, my phone makes for a better assistant in the car than the Echo Auto does. Echo Auto can give directions, for instance, but it cannot pull up my destination in Apple Maps.Voice Recognition: If the device itself says “Alexa”, it will interrupt itself and try to listen for a command. This is dumb. Also cannot be used while radio is playing as it will just keep listening to the radio.",3,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

I have it plugged into my aux and car charger which does cause the cords to dangle over my shifter but I can live with that. Being able to ask question like you normally would echo smart devices is more convenient than asking your phone because typically Siri never hears me. As for getting directions don’t buy this if that’s what you are looking for it is not hands free you have to click a notification on your phone to start directions. I don’t use it for directions so I’m not worried about it, the best thing it is used for is to turn my non Bluetooth music car into Bluetooth to listen to music hands free is just an added benefit but you can still use your phone to play music with it connected.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
Literally the worst amazon product made. I got mine from a friend and wow! It’s so disappointing. Alexa is just not working. She doesn’t understand anything. I try to get her to open to Spotify and she will not open it. Or she will and will play the song that was already there and not the one I asked for. I don’t know why this product is so terrible and yet expensive. DONT BUY IT! Or  if you want to buy it when it’s on sale for like $25 otherwise you waste so much more money!!! Amazon this could be a huge money win and yet you do nothing to fix your product!!!,1,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I have 3 of these.  I put one in each of my cars and used one of them in my wife's for a trip.  After that, she wanted her own.  The first one was a little tricky to get up and running, but what I learned from it made the other 2 just a matter of minutes to get up.  It's great to play Sirius/XM on.  No longer need the expensive monthly charge for a car.  Signed up for the $8/month streaming and now I can use it in any of my cars.  I originally added it to mine because of the lack of bluetooth in them.  With this, I can now use my music on my phone and still have it plugged in to charge.  (iPhone) Little thing, but much better than other solutions.  The added ease of using Amazon music that comes with Prime and being able to easily adjust thermostat and lights on the way home are a bonus.  I did notice through the Alexa app you can not change the wake word on it, but I haven't tried to do it on the device itself.  All in all a great addition to our cars.  I gave it a 5 star (rounded up), but would have given it a 4 1/2 because of the time it took to get the first one going.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,1

I ordered 2 Amazon Auto units before Christmas this year hoping that theywould be better quality and they are. After a few hiccups I have managed to get my unit to work. The only complaint I can now offer is that my grandkids want to play “Baby Shark” 10 times in a row.

"I had high Hope's for this but it didnt work well the navigation would always say it started but then do nothing, the music. Worked but you were unable to control it at all via the phone just voice and had to keep turning the volume down just to pause/ skip songs . As for calls it worked perfectly which is about the only thing I will use it for.  I did find if I just launched the amazon app I could use it as just a bluetooth to 3.5mm adapter which worked well but could not be controlled via voice then.  Seems like they should have included some simple media buttons on this like most bluetooth receivers.  The biggest issue was the resource use on my phone.  Running a top of the line S10 with full bars and when connected my phone would slow down to almost be unusable for any type of data services (like maps) but once disconnected everything worked fine.",2,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"The device works fabulous!  Same commands as all my echo devices. And several for the car.  Only 2 items to mention that gave it 4 stars vs 5.  One of them could be due to background noise so I will chalk it up to that type of environment.  Therefore, when there is some background noise, it does take 2 to 3 takes before the device responds appropriately.  The other issue is I can tell Alexa to call “mom” or “dad” but when I instruct to call by name (a name in my phone book), it does not recognize it.  Therefore, I end up asking Siri to call for me.  Navigation, “Lets Chat”, other skills works great.The only other thing I wish any of my 6 echo devices would do is when I ask for my calendar events, I personally would like it to access the duration of the appointment.  Other than that, great device!",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"I really like having Alexa in my car. The music sounds better than when I play it in my phone. I am having some problems: when I’m in my driveway and my phone is still connected to my wireless, I can’t get it to connect. It says there is no connection. It doesn’t work for me until I drive completely out of my driveway. Also, with the music on, I kinda have to scream at it to be heard. I don’t have to do that for the Alexas in my house. I live in Texas so I have to take it out of my car every time I leave the car. It says it can’t take any heat. That’s inconvenient too. I did get it to give me directions once. It started up maps on my phone, which I had to push a button to get it to work. So, the maps was giving directions and Alexa’s voice was also giving directions. So far I’ve also needed an address. You can’t say things like, the nearest Starbucks.” Not deal breakers, just inconveniences I’m hoping will be fixed in the future.",3,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"The Alexa is good in theory for your car but comes with flaws.  It doesn't stay connected to your phone.  Not sure if that is because of interference between Amazon music and Spotify both wanting to play music from your phone when you turn car on automatically. But each time you get in car, needed to go into bluetooth settings and fix so it worked.  Phone signal also matters or you get buffering.  I have Verizon and I had 4G on my phone but Alexa didnt want to respond. Just not impressed with this one device from Amazon. I had to play with it too much when ultimately I should have all eyes on the road and not with this device.  I consider this work in progress.  Sure they will have 10 different models eventually.",1,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

I am afraid people driving by will hear me yelling to connect!  She keeps stating that she is having problems connecting right now, to try again later. I have internet in the car and it works well.

Ugh We really loved it before you changed something with it and how it pairs or something cuz now it’s a new thing my wife won’t use.

The wires are everywhere, the vent clip doesn’t clip to any vent I’ve tried and the whole thing is slightly less practical then having the cheaper Echo Input in you car instead.  It works great as a Bluetooth accessory for my car - better than any of the FM transmitters I tried.  I just think maybe Echo Auto 2 will be better...particularly when the price is $50!  I got mine for $25 and that is as expensive as this item should ever be.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

When I can get it to play a station it randomly just stops. Stops the music, accepting commands or anything, then after a few minutes, it starts responding again.....It's just not ready yet, thankful to Jeff for the 50% off on purchase price but it's not even worth that.",1,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"Overall, I enjoy having the Echo Auto in my car. It allows me to seamlessly access the major contents of my phone without having to manually turn on a separate Bluetooth dongle or plug into the car’s AUX port. Especially when I discovered the ability to set my default music service in the Alexa app, I was thrilled to be able to easily access my custom or favorite Spotify playlists and artists. That being said, I’ve had multiple issues that get in the way of true functionality. Asking for directions is a bit too much work; in the process of getting Alexa to correctly hear the right location, and then requiring me to open the app *while driving* to activate the directions, there’s enough danger present while driving to nullify the feature. Furthermore, the device has recently lost the ability to skip songs when requested verbally, which also sort of nullifies the ability to play a playlist. It would be nice if it were essentially like talking to Siri through an Alexa car microphone I wouldn’t otherwise have; having to operate through the Alexa app as a necessary second step to use its features makes the “hands free” factor a bit less hands free.Like I said though, overall it’s great to be able to just sit and ask to play a favorite band or my favorite radio station/podcast, just needs to have some kinks worked out (the inability to skip songs might just be a glitch in my device, but for a device I hardly interact with outside of my actual drive, it gets somewhat annoying).",3,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I want to start with saying that I was going to return this product but I was really just to lazy. I tried connecting it to my 2015 BMW X5, which has bluetooth capabilities. I could never get the thing to connect! I was using an iPhone XR and I tried and tried and it just wouldn't connect. I started the return process since I wasn't gonna be able to use the product. I never got around to dropping it off to be shipped out. Several months later I got a new car (2019 BMW 430i Gran Coupe) and I thought ""why not give it a try"". It connected to this car with no issue. I HATE the look of the wires and the vent mount so I keep this in my center console where it is not visible and it has not interfered with the function of the microphone at all. I find it useful in doing things handfree instead of using the wheel to navigate through my infotainment systems menus. It's not a bad product and its really not that expensive but I wouldn't consider it a must-have.",3,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"I have a 2005 Toyota Highlander with the original radio. After adding a Bluetooth to FM adapter, I realized I still touched my phone too much while driving. I bought one of the first Auto devices with minimal expectations. My first test was t o call my father using this device. I could hear him very well and he indicated my voice came across clearly. Shortly afterwards I used the texting option to send him a text and that worked great too. Those features plus the ability to listen to my audio books and any music as I do at home made me a huge fan.

And yes, I kept looking online and trying to figure out how to resolve the connection issue, but was completely unsuccessful... until I tried again yet another day and it just... worked! I have no idea what caused the connection  issue, and I had failed many times by both Bluetooth and by cable... until it mysteriously decided to work (same way I’d already attempted ‘any times previously).

I assume that this might NOT happen if I were to leave my the otherwise completely useless Alexa app open on my phone all the time.

That's annoying. The worst thing is that it interferes with calls I receive in the car.  My phone is attached to the in-car audio system, but the Echo Auto seems to hijack it.  When I get an incoming call, it no longer broadcasts through the speakers.  I had to put the phone itself on speaker, making it harder to hear the conversation.

I've tried other Bluetooth solutions, but they all have to be turned on every time you get in the car, boot up, connect, so it's much easier to just plug the phone into the AUX.

Echo auto can hear my commands even with music turned up pretty loudly.I'm taking off 1-star since I had to set it up 4 separate times all for items that should be able to be toggled on and off in the app. The two big ones I remember was the Echo automatically decided my car was bluetooth enabled and got stuck trying to play through that non-existent service and another time was to enable the Echo to place calls hands-free.

She can give me my schedule, make calls, send texts. I have an older car, so I have to use the Aux. cable, but it works perfectly. If you have bluetooth, it might be even better.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"It solved a problem and works well enough that I use it every day.  I have a Jeep Wrangler, and the stereo defaults to radio when the car starts up.  The audio level I use to play phone audio is much higher than whats needed for the radio, so I would need to adjust the volume before turning off the car.With this I have it plugged into my aux port which auto defaults to aux when the car starts up.  This means no more loud radio, and a device that works well enough. One bummer is I cannot use my steering wheel controls, but after about 2 months of use I can say I still enjoy using it.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I had no problems connecting my Echo Auto. It stays nicely attached to my vent. I do not love that there is always a cord hanging across my dash but it's not a problem really. I love being able to control and change and search for music hands free on Spotify. It also works great for listening to my Audible books. I have only used the Echo for navigation once and it worked well. The main issue I have had is Alexa hearing me. If the music is turned up she can't hear me at all. Even when the music is low I need to really raise my voice to be heard by Alexa. I dislike that 3 second wait for the chime after saying ""Alexa"". I have 4 Echos in my house and use them often and there is no delay with them so it's hard to remember that you can't just launch right into telling Alexa what you want. I got this Echo at a discount with invitation and I feel it's worth what I paid but it definitely still needs some improvements.",3,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"It's.  . . Meh. I got it at a discount because of the invitation thing, and I'm glad I did t pay full price. I had the Roav Viva in my car previously, and this works better than that did, so I'll give them that. But there are random glitches during the games, and it's SUPER annoying whenever she says her own name and then stops to listen, and then exits out of whatever you were doing. Plus, if I ask her to read a text message (which is a new feature for me in my car), it'll show that message on the home screen of my phone for a long time, like, days. AND it will repeat old messages that it has already read for me every time I start the car for the rest of the day.It has its glitches. So I'll leave it at a ""meh"" for now.",3,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"There were a few challenges getting it set up/paired initially, but it was an invite only beta so I anticipated a few issues.  I really dont understand all of the super negative reviews.  If you have an Echo at home, find it helpful, set it up properly, and have a reliable hotspot connection, then it is a great Echo for the car...exactly what it intends to be!  Just like all Echos, it will evolve and get better.  Even better turn by turn directions will make it even better, and more auto specific functionality.  Better voice recognition than 100% of built in vehicle voice recognition...for $49....hard to beat that!",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"I was an early adopter.  Maybe newer versions are better.Connection between the device and my phone is hit and miss.  At times Alexa shows her angry orange face and I have to go through the entire setup process from the start.

"I have the Alexa Auto for a couple of months before I start using it. The main reason is that it is hard to find a good mounting location for the device. The light from the device suggest dashboard mounting. But it will requires explicit wiring which makes the dashboard and the area around the dashboard messy. I eventually chose to mount the device under the dashboard, but it completely blocks the light. It would be much better if there are light around the buttons as well. This will provide a second source to the interaction light. It would be even better to make this configuration as where the notification light is turned on.The functionality of the device is as described. You have the same experience as other Alexa device. However, the phone app sometime goes into the background after long period of idle time. When that happens the device complain about loosing connection to the phone. The only fix at this point is to pull over and reactivate the phone app. This basically make the device unusable from this point. I guess there should some possible software fix to this issue. Hopefully amazon will address it.",3,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"Cool little gadget. If you're an Amazon Prime member and have unlimited data like I do.  This Echo Auto will transform ur daily driving to another level.

It's much better and u get free commercials. Even tho. The mic can pick up much better than my phone. Sometime I have to yell at Alexa while music is playing loud and have a lot of road noise.

I just use this to be able to play my phone playlist and pandora radio in a car which has an outdated audio center (my car will sync for phone use but not to play music).  I ask Alexa to count to 10 so I can adjust the volume correct - that is VERY VERY VERY important since I nearly made myself deaf by accident a couple of times when volume was set improperly.  I am a bit addicted to Alexa at home so this was a natural for me.  My car battery ran down when I left Alexa plugged in - that may be a coincidence but I unplug Alexa from USB port now when leave the car for longer than a day.,4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"This was my first Echo auto unit, it was a bit to get it connected but once you figure it out it works pretty good.Most of the issues you'll have is not going to be with the Echo auto.  Mostly it will be with your cell phone connection to the unit.  The one thing I don't like is if your vehicle has bluetooth you have to connect the audio cable that comes with Echo auto and you can't use your radio/CD and vise-versa because you have your radio set to AUX. Answering an incoming call overrides everything because it's that is controlled by your vehicle.",5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"I got to get my hands on one during the beta release, which I paid about 25$ for.  If you have apple carplay this is pretty much a waste of money.  like other reviews had stated, it is not quite ready for prime time right now.  Could be great, but it is just okay, and knowing that, I would not spend $50.00 for it.  I do use it, but setting it up was very annoying.  I would constantly have to refresh the alexa app on my phone, to get it to work.End story -- if you have apple carplay, don't get this, pointless.

"I liked the idea of having an Alexa in my car that I could use to gain information about things that may have interested me while in the car. The reality is much different, there is no sharing of the resources of the audio system in the car, the Auto Echo has to have exclusive access to the Bluetooth input to the radio for it to function, and that means that whatever else you may wish to use the audio system for is not possible. I use the SYNC system in my Ford and in order to use it I can't use the Auto Echo at the same time. Not a very useful device since it is so limited in use.",1,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"I was so excited to get this product.  I pre-ordered it and waited forever for it.  When I set it up, it was difficult to connect it to both my car and my phone.  What was really disappointed. Besides the difficulty in setting it up, it only works when the car radio is on AUX or Media so using it requires that I change the input so I can hear its response.  Also it seems that the volume on this device is much lower than other devices so after I have changed the audio input, I also need to raise the volume.

I do not know if they did a software update, but I am grateful it is fixed and working as advertised.  It's pretty cool driving down the road and asking' ALEXA, where am I?

I use it mostly for directions and  playing music as well as the usual alexa tasks like the weather and trivia. In the past I used my phone with alexa installed but the Auto has much more reliable voice recognition and better control overall.  My only issue was with the messy looking long cords.

This thing just doesn't work well - every time I get in my car, it makes me set it up again, which means watching the video every time I start my car. Since there is apparently no way to skip it...While driving, I lose connection frequently and randomly during my trips. It was fun for the first day - my daughter sits in the back and she loved being able to ask Alexa to play what she wanted to listen to, once. I did like the map that it pulled up on my phone, one of the few times it maintained connection. It was accurate and took me where I wanted to go, but it was Google Maps which always works fine for me, so this isn't something special related to the Alexa software.",1,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"First off let’s start with the 3 star rating. This has nothing to do with the device itself, just the junk of a vent clip they give you to clip it to your vent. During beta testing they gave out a sticky pad with a magnetic base that work perfectly. Now they released it to everyone and the mount option is only a vent clip. This vent mount falls off non stop and is just junk. I bought a few anti skid mats to set the Alexa on that works good, but not as great as the mount they have during beta.Everything else is really good. I have noticed a few issues with connection when connected to my wife’s S-10 phone but now issues at all while connected to my iPhone XS. Works the same as any other Alexa speaker.

We played with it & got it to work. We loved it,,,,and then it became non responsive, quite often. We’ve had this 1 for 2 months & it is hit & miss. Just isn’t reliable. I LOVE IT when it works.

"So I was excited to order this because it was going to help make my drive more hands free, like asking for directions while currently driving and not have to worry about pulling over to type the address in.  There are no instructions on this in the box, and the set up takes forever.  If I shut the car off, even for a short time to just pump gas, it disconnects and the whole process has to start over.  It has difficulty connecting to my blue-tooth, which means I have to play with it for a few minutes before I can even pull out of my driveway.  I try to ask for directions, and it doesn't understand, so I have to repeat my request multiple times, which can be difficult when I have a small child in the back asking why I keep asking the same thing and why isn't Alexa listening to me.  I stopped using it about a month or 2 ago, since it doesn't usually help with anything I need while driving.  Maybe if they make some updates so that it won't disconnect each time, or make the re-connection easier/faster, as well as making it more user friendly, I will start to use it again.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

You can play music playlists quickly, get weather or traffic and call people on your contacts without removing your hands from the steering wheel or touching a thing.  Obviously it is like taking your echo at home with you but it really is useful for things while driving!

The fact that it uses Bluetooth to connect to your car but it also needs a Bluetooth to connect Alexa to your phone makes it not work. Your phone will never allowed to Bluetooth devices to stream at the same time. So now you have to get a car with an Aux cable to go from ALEXA into your phone into the car. Why can’t I just bypass my phone and go from ALEXA into the car. Why because ALEXA failed they did not think this through and the fact you have to lie to the Alexa app and tell them you’re a passenger Every time you turn on the car  just to use it which is also ridiculous Is a lazy  way for Amazon to get past any liability....fail Amazon you failed,1,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"Echo Auto was easy to set up. I had to use an FM transmitter because my car (16 years old) does not have Bluetooth. It works fine. Every time I get in my car, FM transmitter, Echo Auto, phone, and car stereo reconnect automatically. I simply say ‘Alexa, read my book’. Only thing I have to watch out for is to wait until I am out of WiFi range for my home network, otherwise the phone gets confused. One time, the volume decreased without me changing it. It turned out to be the Volume on the Echo Auto. I readjusted it by saying ‘Alexa, increase the volume’ a few times. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. I finished ‘reading’ my first audio book.",4,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0

Speaking of wires, the little wire holder fell off in the heat almost immediately. Connection is usually good except when I get in the car my phone is weakly connected to my home router so as it loses its wifi connection the echo won't work well. It also messes up my audible spot if I tell the echo to play my audio book instead of just pressing play on my phone. I'd like to buy another for my wife but it's a lot more expensive now. Hopefully they'll go on sale in December.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I was so excited to be invited to purchase this product during their introductory period. I am a BIG Echo and Alexa fan, and I'd probably end up purchasing more Echo Spots and Alexa products to use in my home if I had more rooms to place these devices in. For what the Echo Auto is, I think it's fantastic. I had no issues with set-up as some other reviewers seem to keep having. I set it up the first time and it's been working perfectly since. I did have to ""re-setup"" after upgrading my phone, but it was still an easy and quick process - took less than 10 minutes to complete. The sound quality is great, even when not connected to bluetooth, and I love that the piece to plug in the Echo Auto has two USB ports, so I can still use the second port to actually charge my phone as well.Obviously like any starter product there are some minor tweaks and flaws, such as their voice recognition and Alexa understanding everything you're saying such as inputing an address. I've only encountering very minor problems with this, honestly nothing that I wasn't able to go back and fix and nothing that caused me a huge hassle. Overall the convenience of this product surpasses these minor flaws.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0

That means it won't work, unless you open the app on your phone and click the button.  If you are driving this is a pain in the neck and not particularly safe.",1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"Big flaw with the echo auto is that it integrates, voice, to announce on your car bluetooth.  I never have my audio system on Bluetooth.  I use my radio for music and news.  The other disadvantages of the bluetooth setting is that the volume has to se adjusted load to hear.  So now a ""hands free"" option to use alexa in my car now causes me to first change my audio input, increase the volume, speak the command, reduce the volume, return audio input back to radio.Why doesn't the Alexa Auto act like my phone pair to my car?

And by the way I had to purchase another smart phone because my original Samsung Galaxy J3 Orbit did not support the Alexa app that you had to download to use this device. Getting it to pair with Bluetooth and the phone was unbelievably difficult but I persevered my way through it. It only took several days. After finally getting everything to work properly I did a data usage test to see what it was going to cost me to operate. To play approximately one hour of music, it consumed 230 MB which is almost 1/4 GB. I pay $10.00 for 1 GB of data  with my carrier. At $3.99 per month for amazon music plus $10.00 for 1 GB of data it would cost $14.00 per month for four hours of music.

It does integrate very well with my Alexa environment at home, I have multiple Smarthome devices and Alexa all over. Though it was nice once I asked what was the temperature at home and was able to change it from the car before I arrived. The only issue I found is the quality of the audio, I am quite picky at this and it is a bit frustrating that the audio levels and clipping of the audio is very common.

It does not connect to my Pixel 3a and I am forced to put the Echo Auto into set up mode for it to identify my phone. I've removed and added the Auto multiple times and it is a recurring issue.

I wish I could report what the magical sequence was for everyone else trying to figure it out, but I don't know for sure.  I was literally moments away from sending it back...BUT once I got everything synced and paired, it's worked pretty much flawlessly.  It does take about 5 seconds after the car starts to connect and sync up, but after that it works great.  Sometimes with the music up, you have to shout to get Alexa's attention, but all Alexas are prone to that.  And sometimes something on the radio will say Alexa or something similar, and she'll respond - also a problem with all Alexas.

I got this during the beta sale and for the price I feel it was one of my best tech purchases of 2019. It does what I need it to do, change music with my voice, and it does it well.

"I have been using Echo devices for some time but I am so disappointed with this product that I would give a zero if there was an option.First, its Bluetooth integration is so unreliable that I have been able to use only a few times and do not know how it worked. Second, every time I try to use I feel I am lying because the only option it gives me is “I am a Passenger”, instead of asking “Are you driving?” Yes or No and give the disclaimer. Third, it is suppose to be an Auto-use device and logically must follow the location of the cell phone to give information about traffic or weather of that location but it gives me the information of my home location. What is the use when I am several miles away driving? Fourth, I do not know whether it shares/ is connected to the same machine learning protocol with other Echo devices because Echo Auto does not understand the same commands other Echo devices we own- one Echo Show, one Amazon Echo, three Echo Dots, and two Echo Inputs have started to understand and execute. They really need to work on this device. Fifth, I contacted the customer support and was kicked around chatting to three different people giving me the same advice. Unplug it and reboot the device. I do not know whether they have a trouble shoot protocol in place. I am disappointed to say the least.",1,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

"I wanted you to know that I have an early alexa auto and my holder is different than the new ones. My husband's is vent mounted and he doesn't like it. It can fall off and be in the way of the heat and ac. He also has his phone there too. I have mine on the dash and it is stuck to the top. I love it. It doesn't move, never falls off, and solid. I can still remove it the way it is, in a bracket that hugs it and still allows it to be taken off. I want Amazon to know this is a much better mount. Please go back to this mount or let me order one for my husbands.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
We love being able to listen to whatever type of music we want and being able to listen to audiobooks upon request.The only problem is Alexa’s not being able to work with our phone without messing with settings almost every time we get back into car.

"I bought this thinking it would be useful, as I have gotten used to Alexa in our home. Instead, I found myself trying to find any useful reason to use this in my car. It often didn't connect properly and it didn't interface well with my VW. I often had to try to awake Alexa several times. Maybe this is useful for people who use only Amazon Music, but I have a 64GB SD card with a large portion of my music collection on it. And when I was connected to that, Alexa couldn't interrupt the input source like my phone could. I returned it. the device. It seems really half-baked.",1,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"I loved the fact that I was able to purchase Alexa for the van.  It was a must have item, since we love Alexa at home.  The set up was quick and easy, but the product has some serious flaws.  The connection is constantly lost when we turn the car off and needs to be re synced with the phone.  So the amount of time we are in the car either at the start of the trip of driving and losing connection or at each destination makes myself and the kids frustrated.  The concept is excellent, but why it cant work like the other Alexa's is frustrating.  I do hope that the continue to make updates and possibly there will not be a issue soon.",3,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"I have been using the new Echo Auto for about two weeks and if it owns up to my expectations it will be a change in the way we drive our older automobiles.  All you need is a car with bluetooth or an Aux Port to function.  The system with the vent mount is a good size and fit for most vehicles.Now for a couple of issues.  I have the iPhone 7+ and it connects to the Alexa App and my car bluetooth and Echo Auto Echo ""most"" of the time.  When it does not I must perform a bit of troubleshooting to determine if it is the Echo, Car, or iPhone.  It the Echo just tells you that you have lost connection to the phone, we need a bit more information in your troubleshooting diagnostic software.  Maybe when the Alexa App loses connectivity it would send and alert if the connection is lost there and then send the connection to the App via the Alert to make it easier on the user.  The more information the three variable can send to us the quicker we can get back synchronized with the Echo Auto.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"I was so excited to get this and was sure it would be equally as cool as my Echo Plus in the house. First, I had a little trouble getting it connected. But, after about an hour I figured it out.  Not sure if that was just me missing something, or if the directions were lacking. My car is also equipped with Apple Car Play, so I think everything was getting confused when I had everything hooked up. I think it would have been better for a car that does not have car play. Also I hate the cords. I do have to say that I was happy that I didn’t need to use any adhesives, and the vent clip holds it surprisingly secure. I would get it working, which was great but then every time I turn the car off and get back in I would need it to pair it again.

"Overall, more work is needed for this device to really become a thing you need in the car.  My three biggest gripes:1. It's hard to browse stations.  On the radio, you just go from pre-set to pre-set (my GM vehicle integrates Sirius XM stations as well).  For Alexa, you have to state the station and where to pull it from, each time.  I just don't know all the individual station ID's to do that.  The workaround is that I browse stations on the radio itself, and if I need something from Alexa, I'll just ask it, but that brings it to the next gripe:",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

"Bought my first Echo Auto by Invitation. Hooked it up and loved it right away. Totally hands-free music, phone calls, to-do lists, pretty much anything I need to do while driving. Occasional issues connecting, but that is due to the outdated  stereo in my truck. On the other hand, bought a second one for my wife's car. Works like a champ. Instant connections and no issues at all. In fact, she would regularly drop audio and have to reconnect when her phone was connected to her car, but now with Echo Auto in the mix, no more dropped audio.

"I got my long awaited invitation, ordered the unit, and tried to install it in my car...for over an hour. Finally got it connected, Alexa responds, and she only half fulfills the request.

She acts like she's going to, then nothing. I contacted customer service, and after talking to two people, they decided to send me another unit. We'll see how this one works, but so far, I'm not impressed. And what's the question about sound quality when I'm writing a review?

Due to this our home device is named echo. I would like all of the devices to be named echo so I can keep straight what I'm saying.

"I bought this hoping to make my work vehicle (late model Honda Civic Hybrid) a truly hands-free vehicle because I have a very long commute (2.25 to 4.25 hours each way, depending on traffic).  The Alexa Auto does not integrate well even with other Amazon apps (e.g., Audible and Kindle).  It does not ""learn"" voice commands, even with repeated, slowly and clearly enunciated attempts. Since I commute from a rural area, the fact that the connection is dropped completely every time I drive through a zone with weak cell-phone signal makes it pretty useless.  It would be absolutely AWESOME to have an Alexa device with its own reliable network uplink and excellent voice command recognition to provide a truly hands-free, on the road, communications experience.

Otherwise I ask for music and there are either extremely long delays or it doesn't play at all, or I'll go back to playing Song Quiz and then in the middle of the game it will shut it off and start playing the song I asked for 5 minutes ago.

You have to be careful where you place it though. I use the auto mount with it and it can't be lowered because the air from the vents makes it not hear properly. I also have trouble with it hearing me when the windows are down or the sunroof is open. I also don't like that it uses another USB port. The cord is very stiff so it isn't easily hidden or put out of the way.  I don't think I'd rush to buy it again but I don't mind having it, when it works properly.",3,1,2019-11-12,1,0,1

Again, I am impressed with it.I read the reviews about losing the connection, re-starting, etc and was going to pass on it til my friend told me it was good enough.

There was a slight issue with my playlists at first but one chat with customer support resolved that issue right away!

"I'm a huge Alexa fan, with 5 devices in various rooms of my home.  I was naturally excited to bring Alexa to my ride, but this really disappoints due to the clunky interface.  First, it's not wireless :( The wire has to plug in to a cigarette lighter or USB port; the wire gets in the way and you have to work around it to use your car's touch screen or gear shift.  Secondly, it takes too long to connect once it does plug in.  Thirdly, the sound recognition struggles.  The light is too dim during the day to know if Alexa is listening, leading to you and Alexa talking over each other.  This sometimes ends in the inevitable yelling of Alexa's name :).  I wouldn't waste your money on this version.  The best case would be to have Alexa integrated to the vehicle's software.  An interim improvement would be to make it wireless with an indicator to know when to charge it.",1,1,2019-10-21,1,1,0

The vent mount is the only option included - when the product was first released it included a dash mount.  That was changed to the vent mount shortly after release due to issues with the adhesive on hot car dashboards losing adhesion.  Makes sense, but I'm still going to mod this and dash mount it.Amazon changed the mounting hardware, and only provides the vent mount now, instead of providing a dash mount.  Why not provide both and give the option?  I do not want a vent mount...  so now I'll use some double sided tape.  Seems ridiculous for a brand new product out of the box.",3,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

Why does it not natively connect to Bluetooth or Apple/Android auto? Also, since it’s wired directly to the vehicle’s radio/navigation hub via USB, why can’t Alexa EVER reconnect on its own when the car is restarted?

"Tested Echo Auto paired with an iPhone8 operating IOS 13.2 in multiple vehicles. The Echo Auto skill for Alexia appears to rely on Bluetooth Ver 3.x or newer in order to work effectively with the car speakers your vehicle. For example if you are used to using the Google map application on your Bluetooth connected iPhone, then you are used to hearing the directions over your car speakers. Essentially the Echo Auto skill counts on this Bluetooth capability  in order for you to hear Alexia's responses to your questions/instructions/replies input via the Echo Auto microphones. To be sure the Echo Auto's multiple ""near field"" diversity microphones are much better than the microphone from your auto manufacturer. My experiences were: that for a compact SUV circa 2014 (Bluetooth Ver 3.x) Auto worked quite well, for a luxury sports car circa 2007 (Bluetooth Ver 2.x) it was a  poor experience because Echo Auto could not properly connect to the Bluetooth system and thus there was no connection to the cars speaker system. My second vehicle did not have an Aux audio input into the the sound system so if your older vehicle has such an input you can get around the issue I have described. Bottom line is that if you have older vehicle that is uses an older version of Bluetooth, no Aux input to your car sound system and you wanted to add voice activation with Alexia through the Echo Auto, you will likely be disappointed. Sorry Amazon you can do better in describing to potential customers how to connect this product to older vehicles to avoid wasting their time and money.",2,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0

Several of the commands that work at home spent the Echo Auto into a loop it could not get it out without rebooting. You should also know that the car mount ledge is backwards of the way you think it would be.

It wasn’t as easy to set her up as it should have been through blue tooth. Make sure you have time to sit in your car for 15-20 minutes to get it set up before you drive off.

It works just like the Alexa AP on your phone so there is not much of an advantage wit the exception that it is on when you get in the car where as the App has to be open on you phone.  One of the Quirks is that many advertisers tell you how to enable their radio station on your Echo as home, unfortunately when some on on the radio says ""All you have to say is Alexa enable Hot 102.9"" You echo begins to play 102.9.",4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Overall, I am very happy with my Alexa for the car.  My main concern is that because the car audio must be on, my I-phone always automatically starts playing music.  It seems the Bluetooth on the phone and Alexa--both needed my overlap/conflict in some way.  My work around is to start the car with the car audio off, which seems to be working okay.  I then need to turn it one after starting the car.It is the best hands-free phone set up for the car that I have ever used.  And, I love my ability to work on my shopping list hands-free too.",4,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
Liked: able to ask questions without having to touch my phone. Can play games like Jeopardy on lengthy drives. So many uses rather than SIRI. I love asking for any song I want to hear and its available!Didn't like.: not that easy to connect and too partial to Apple. I have an Android.  I'm sure the next model might take care of these issues.,4,1,2019-10-13,1,1,0
"I bought this as a gift for my sister. She loves having Alexa in her car. The internet service at her house is very poor, so trying to turn on lights from the car is impossible. This allows her to turn on lights before getting out of the car. The one thing that she would like to see is a different mounting method. She does not like the vent mount, and the cord is very long. She would like to have a shorter option so that it isn't draped all over the dashboard controls for radio and air conditioner. Other than that, she is very happy with this product!",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
I was happy to get the invite to purchase Amazon Echo Auto. I have an older car that does not have Bluetooth so I was so excited to hear about Echo Auto.  I have many Amazon devices and have loved each one as they are extremely beneficial around the house so I thought the car would be even better where I cant use my hands!Pros:,4,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
I have a 2015 Acura TLX and I don’t feel the Echo Auto integrated well with the tech / infotainment system. I believe this can be a good device for older cars with less tech. I’m also not a big fan of mounting this device with the mount I originally received as part of the purchase promotion and it doesn’t stay positioned on your dash very well if you just let it lay flat. I think Amazon still needs to work out the kinks with this device. I ended up using the Echo Auto in my garage to connect to my iPhone via Bluetooth and play music through aux jack connected speakers.,2,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"“Alexa. Alexa? ALEXA!”Even though this unit is right next to me in the car, it consistently has a hard time hearing me (Radio off. Radio on. Doesn’t matter.) And even when I finally get through the unit has a 50% chance of understanding my request, usually giving up with the “kerplunk” sound. Since the unit has to be plugged into the car and my phone also has to be plugged into the car, it’s definitely not even semi-standalone.  I have Siri and my car’s assistant, plus I can open the Alexa App on my phone and get the same info I get the car unit.",1,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"My first review was unkind as the Echo Auto was very difficult to set up; I thought it was never going to work.  Then, even after it started working, it worked intermittently for a while.  For the last month or so it has been more reliable and I use it fairly often.  It works for announcements to my Alexa devices at home, Spotify, SiriusXM and Amazon Music (I haven't used it for anything else, yet).  Although set up was not easy, and it still has some problems executing commands, if you have Alexa devices in your home and have a long commute to work, you may like it.",3,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"Setup took 5 minutes max. Plugged in included cigarette plug adapter, plugged audio cable into echo and jack in car (no Bluetooth in car) connected power to echo paired with phone and now I can get into car automatically connects! WITHOUT having to take phone out of my backpack! I can call up Pandora stations, iHeartRadio, Amazon music and Waze driving directions.

"First let me say that when she works, she's an absolute peach. I love the complete hands free aspect of her. I have a password on my phone so Google and Alexa wont work through that without my imputing a password.Now, there has been MANY times when she just doesn't work. I say Alexa, she turns blue and dings. I give my command and she turns off. I repeat this process a few times before I finally give up.

"It has helped my HANDSFREE time behind the wheel,  but I still have to touch my phone sometimes! I LOVE being able to talk to Alexa while I'm driving. Can't rate sound since there was no sound because I don't have a car with BLUETOOTH!  It does contain a very short audio cable that I was able to hook up to my car stereo, but I am now limited on where it can placed until I BUY another cable or get a car with BT!  I can't seem to figure out how to search the internet yet or have it open/read my Hoopla audio books.  May be operator error.  IDK.",4,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"I was so excited when I received my Echo Auto.  However, the excitement did not last long.  I have spent hours trying to resolve various issues.  The setup process had a few hiccups, but I was able to get the Echo Auto working.  For some unknown reason, it randomly loses connection.  I have several Echo devices in my home, so I am familiar on how to request information from Alexa.  I use Echo Auto for directions and it works well, until it loses connection.  My biggest complaint is using the calling feature.  One of the main reasons why I got this device is my car does not have bluetooth.  I live in a hands-free state, so I must make phone calls without holding my phone.  When I ask Alexa to call someone from my contacts list, I get a message stating the number cannot be completed as dialed.  However, when I tell her the number (which is also in my contacts list) to dial (123-456-7899), the call goes through with no problem.  None of my other Echo devices have had any issues calling from my contacts list.  When I contacted the customer support department, I was only directed to reset the device.  I have reset my device numerous times and the problem still exists.  I do not know if the unit is faulty or if it is a glitch in the system.",2,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"Let me just say I’m glad Nationwide sent me this thing for free. It is December of 2019.... that matters because I’m giving it the “it’s not there yet” rating. It will be eventually but way too many glitches and the lack of tie-ins are severely lacking. When my phone is right in front of me and already connected via Bluetooth (which is needed to make this thing work) 90% of anything you would do during a car ride is harder to do with Echo Auto. If I ignore that a say I’ll deal with that for the couple other perks, half the time it glitches connecting to Sirius, it doesn’t know where I live (besides the fact that I have a Prime account that knows my address I also filled it out on the Alexa app), it hasn’t known a single destination I’ve asked for but it claims it’s growing its knowledge on that yet. I’d go on but I’ll just say I gave it the best try I could stand. I have other smart devices and am waiting for many other smart home pieces to find their way before I invest, this is one of them. Save your money...for now.",1,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"There a some good things and bad things about the Amazon Echo Auto. The good things are that it paired well with my bluetooth capable vehicle. It was able to connect every time without any issues which was great! I loved that I could play music, make calls, and use skills without the need to distract myself from the road.On the other hand, the speakers have a hard time picking up my voice if the vehicle or outside roads are noisy. And I do not love that it covers most of my vent which is crucially used on most days. And lastly, any time Alexa ends up saying her own name, it will trigger her to activate. This become cumbersome when you are using a skill or anything else related.",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"When this works it works great. However, if I leave the unit plugged in when the car is off it fails to connect the next time I start the car. I then have to unplug the unit and plug it back in. Also there is a delay in the response time from when you say the wake word until you can make a request. This is hard to get used to If you use Alexa at home where there is no delay. You also have to remember to activate the Bluetooth input to the cars audio system. The unit has a built in speaker but I can’t figure out how to make this the default audio output.",5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0

I hated having it in my car bc I could no longer push a button to make a phone call—I had to make calls through Alexa. Nope. There is little to like about this thing. It’s worthless and a pain in the butt to use if you have Bluetooth connectivity between your car and phone already.

"I like the concept, since my minivan is an older model and I have a lot of kids I am able to speak with Alexa to get their songs to speak with people on the phone and to unlock my front door. I personally don't think that it should be as expensive as $50 because a lot of times it does not connect to the app, but when I do get it connected it works ok. It never has answered the phone, the customer service representative  never could figure out why. I do want to get my husband one however I don't know if I should get him this one or the input because it seems like the input does the same thing just doesn't call.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"Nice companion to Echo system. Enjoy having Alexa available in my car,  Great for had free operation for phone calls and text messages.

"Listen I was passed on this item a couple months ago after YouTubing the item and listening to a few disappointing videos. Then I saw the commercial of the rich prick doctor in his expensive whip turning on the lights for his hot wife in their huge home while he was heading to work. I watched a few more videos at that point, and I saw new good ratings for the Amazon Auto, and it happened to be on sale for $34.00, do I pulled the trigger! The AmzAuto is freaking amazing! I mean it works great. It's perfect with my Google maps and it quites down got a direction announcement. It's like have a XM radio for a one time fee! It finds everything I'm asking for... I. E. Places, music and info. The one caveat out I found, was it lost my location, but I asked again and it worked fine. But my only problem is, I don't know some Artists names to ask for a particular song, I get brain freeze when trying to remember a song... But I digress.

"I’ve had mine for about 2 months and hate it. It’s not very useful. There is very little that is worth using while driving other than to say “hey, check this out”. A lot of what it dose can be done with Siri if you have an iPhone by saying “hey Siri”. I actually think you can do a lot more with an iPhone than you can with this. The only thing that would be good about this is telling Alexa to play music from Amazon music but that seems to only work about 50% of the time and I end up just having to do it myself through the app on my phone. I would not recommend this at all and have taken mine out of the car.",1,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0

It's literally a hands free device, but everytime I start the car, if I want to use it, I have to pull out my phone, go into the app, [and assuming it even pops up] then click on the button that says ""i'm a passenger"".IT'S A HANDS FREE DEVICE.  why do I need to be a passenger???  why doesn't it just connect automatically like any other sanely designed bluetooth product does???  on top of that, if it's not connected, it likes to imagine it hears its name every so often and blurts out ""I'm not available right now, trying to connect to your mobile device"" or something to that extent.  If it just connected immediately to my phone and acted like every other normal hands free Alexa, I'd use it more.  But instead, it sits there unused most the time.",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I already have two Alexa Dot products inside the house and love them. This generation of Alexa Auto, however, performs inconsistently for me. There was no scripted set of steps that would work each time to get it going. I loved it when it finally worked but hated it most times cuz it wouldn't. The final straw was when it was in the middle of ""Alexa shuffle Tony Bennett music"". While ""Alexa pause"" would obey, I couldn't get ""Alexa stop"" to happen. It even continued Tony Bennett music the next day with no prompting from me. Again as the day before, ""Alex stop"" or ""Alexa cancel"" made no difference. I unplugged it and put it promptly back in the box.",2,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
Ok I really like this echo auto. First off I think it does a better job of voice to text than Google. Also includes the original voice recording as a url link for 24 hour retention. As a truck driver the more access I have to my phone without having to touch it is great. I like how I can ask about the weather for whatever city. Anything you can do at home with Alexa you can now do while driving. If I remember I need to shop for something I can ask Alexa to add it to my shopping list. If I want to listen to a radio station Alexa will check both tune in and iheart radio. Can easily set reminders.The only thing that stops this review from getting 5 stars is how sometimes she wakes up thinking you called out her name when she was mistaken. While listening to audiobooks this can be a little annoying. Otherwise I don't have anything negative to say about it.,4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"The idea is great, but still not all the way there. The Bluetooth connection with my phone is very unstable. I have to disconnect the device  from the power and reconnect for it to communicate with the phone. Besides, if it does have a speaker, why must we listen trough the car stereo?

My car does not have the preferred air vents; but, no problem! Alexa Auto has a self stick on it’s bottom that I stick to my dashboard. It looks great.

I love having Alexa in the car. However being a sports car with mild exhaust upgrades and the higher road noise then other cars it will not recognize that I've called for it on occasion. I have to yell and it's prob a foot from where I'm sitting. Also if I turn the car off and then resume a session on occasion it will be difficult to get it to pick up from where it left off but it may be an issue with my radio blue tooth and not the actual echo auto.

"I love Alexa in my home, use it for everything I can.  But in the car?  Well, less than hoped for.  First, it seems to lose connection to the phone too often.  Second, I have to keep selecting the source (my car apparently resets to FM1 every time I shut it off).  Third, the volume seems to default to level 2 or three, and I have to tell her to increase it over and over until I get to level 10, at which point it is just about equal to the car's internal sound levels.  So, it is nice, but frustrating.  Plus, it takes up a connection point.  Overall,  the steps are too much for my wife to walk through so she doesn't use it at all.  Once connected and adjusted, it performs perfectly, but it is *almost* too much work to keep it installed and used.  If it had a native Ford Sync app so I could select and adjust volume from the car's touch screen, that would make it tons better!",4,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
I bought this on impulse and returned it within a day. I use Alexa at home all the time so it seemed like a good idea to have it in my car.The big problems for me with the device was the poor mounting bracket. I just couldn’t find a good place in either of my cars to mount it.,3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"This was going to be my go-to tech gift for the in-laws and parents this year, but as others have stated, this is not ready for prime time. I was so excited to be ""chosen"" to beta test this, but it seems like they gave the beta testing phase about 4 days before it became available to the general public, and it shows. From the cables going across my dash, to the super bad lag time from the wake word to her turning on her little blue light, it is just not worth it unless I was taking a 2+ hour road trip somewhere. You have to have already launched the Alexa app (why? I never have to do this at home?) AND the app you want to use (in my case, Spotify) for her to acknowledge your commands. By the time, I take my eyes off the road to this, it already defeats her entire purpose in life.

Yes, its just another thing on the dash but in the end I would buy it again.

Also, the location data is a little wonky still.BUT those are minor quibbles - the benefits are huge.  When you're driving you dont want to be fumbling with your phone.  Also, it's dangerous!

In my first week with the device I needed to go into the Alexa app and delete the device and reinstall it every time I tried to use it or else it would not work.  This was extremely frustrating and the device was pretty much useless for the first week.  This was most likely due to the interference of other bluetooth devices in the car (cellphone).

Install on our Ford F150 was not too difficult once we figured out you need to push the ""Media"" button on the radio to use it. Sound is very low and need to turn the volume up high to hear it.

Wasn't why expected. If you have bluetooth already in your vehicle it's useless. The only reason I'm keeping it I ended it up putting it in my other vehicle that does have bluetooth.  I also kept because I got on black friday. Fort that price it's kind of worth it. If I know it was just a bluetooth device I wouldn't have ordered it. It just a bluetooth device that connects to your phone to connect to car. So every smartphone has bluetooth and if your stereo system already have bluetooth you dont needed it because you just active Alexa on your phone and you talk to it thrubyourbcall already.

"I love the idea of this, but there's been issues. My wife and I both got one because we use Alexa to bring some extra sanity to our busy lives. I love the audible integration and she loves making lists of things on the go. The main issues I've experienced has been centered around the integration/connection to my phone's Alexa app and it not working anywhere close to 100%. In a normal commuting week I probably have to open the Alexa app on my phone a couple days. This is not a huge deal to me and I would gladly start a habit of opening my app each time I got in the truck, but the major issue is when it just doesn't respond to anything. Say the wake word, it chimes and lights up blue like normal, ""Play my audio book"" (or whatever), and nothing. No error message, nothing to indicate it understood. Sometimes there's the blue light flashing like it's working and then it will turn off. Sometimes it doesn't do anything. In these situations, the best I can hope for is to unplug the USB to knock out power and plug it back in. This rarely fixes the issue and I can't really fiddle with the thing while I'm driving in traffic.All that said, I really like the thing and I'm sure it will be improved. I almost never get a great experience from first generation hardware so I can deal with it for now, but unless there's improvement via updates I'll be watching for competition to see who's going to provide the best in-car experience.",2,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0

While it plays and connects via bluetooth, you still have to plug it in for power which means you have a long cord going from your charger to the vent stand.  Since it uses your phone data anyway, I'm not sure there's much advantage to this then just talking to the Alexa app on your phone.  I haven't compared that app head to head for voice recognition but suspect it's pretty similar. Not really worth it.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I wanted to love Alexa auto completely, alas, I don't. The setup was incredibly easy, ended up using double sided tape to attach it to the console.

"I’ve been playing around with the Echo auto for a couple of weeks. It was easy to install. I’ve been using the Drop In feature on my way home from work and it very cool and safer than playing around with my phone. I feel like the sound is very good. I love requesting songs to play. It can tell me where the nearest gas station is too. What I don’t like is how long it takes for my car to connect to Bluetooth since I’ve installed the Echo Auto. I want to listen to my audiobook and it connects and says it collecting my phone information before connecting to Bluetooth. It seems like it keeps trying this cycle over and over again before I can get it to play my book. I have to keep hitting the play button, it plays through my phone then pauses then tries to connect to Bluetooth again. I eventually get my book to play. I feel like I’m going to be at my destination before I get my book to play.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Still has a way to go.  Takes a while to connect.  I can go a few miles before it connects and I only drive 2 miles to work, so it just frustrates me.  I like that it does play amazon music which I have for a 3 mo free trial but I am not paying $9/month for it after that and so far that’s all I like on it.  My car/phone can do anything it can do but put groceries on my list.  When i asked Alexa for directions to the nearest Outback Steakhouse she was sending me to another state!  It still needs work and I don’t want it sucking up my data doing things that my phone or car connect could do faster.  It was a good idea, just not carried out well.",1,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

I haven't tried pressing the power button to reset, will try next time.

"I waited almost 9 months to get my invitation to purchase, and it's definitely worth the wait! It took less than 5 minutes to set up and get connected to my car's bluetooth, and the connection is seamless. I can easily access music, podcasts, and audio books without taking my eyes off the road. Speak to text works better than through my phone outside of the car, and the response time to commands has shortened dramatically from when Echo first came out. I love everything about it, but gave it 4 stars because the knob on the front that holds the wires fell off after only a couple of days, and the car adapter was not included in the box.I called Amazon support about the missing adapter, and they immediately applied a code to my account so I could get a replacement at no cost.

When my husband got home I had him try to set it up with his phone. He spent about 15 minutes in the car with the engine running and got it to work. The next day I tried it again with my phone and no luck. I just came here to see other reviews and am feeling much better. It’s not just me. The directions aren’t thorough.

My car recently updated the system to support Android Auto it sucks compared to Alexa.  The ability to use Waze on the screen  is way oversold.

"I bought this for mostly so my wife could take advantage of Alexa in the car and it works for that, but falls short on being the voice control of the phone.  If you ask Alexa to send a message, it uses your home Echo's to deliver the message which is nearly useless.  It can not access phone messages to read them while you drive.  Navigation, if you ask for directions, it is shown on Google Maps but on the phone so I need a phone mount as well as my Echo mount.

"As an early Alexa user, I had high hopes in this new echo device. My echo's at home work great so I was expecting the same for this device in my car. Well that turned out to be a... disaster.Oddly, the microphone is not great quality. Most of the time, the device couldn't hear me well.

"I bought this for my wife as a gift, since we have Echos in our home, use Alexa often, and my wife loves technology (she works in IT). So far it has been very unreliable, as it only connects about half the time.  When it does work it is great, but about half the time is says it has lost it’s connection and won’t work.  Even though her phone is successfully connected to the car stereo and the Echo Auto via Bluetooth, the Alexa App on the phone is open and working, the Echo Auto device says it can’t connect.  We can be playing music through the Alexa app on her phone, and the Auto still says it lost/cannot get connection.  If we go into the Settings and click around, sometimes it will reconnect, and other times nothing changes.  Then the next time she gets in the car it will work fine, with no rhyme or reason.  With the time it takes to play around with the Settings or try multiple times to connect, this device literally saves us no time or effort as opposed to just using Alexa through the Amazon Music or Alexa apps on the phone, which cost nothing as opposed to the $50 I spent for this piece of plastic.  I can see why this would be helpful if it worked, but it has been more trouble than it is worth so far.  If I had it to do over, I would save the $50 and just continue to use Alexa through the phone apps, since they seem to have all of the same features as the Echo Auto, with more reliability and without all the additional hassle.",1,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"This device never should have gone to market. I wonder how many Echo Autos have been thrown out the owner’s vehicles and are now littered on this country’s highways? Terrible voice recognition. At times you have to yell at the device like a demented loon. If it’s cloudy, cannot access network. If it’s foggy, cannot access network. If it rains, cannot access network. If it’s a clear sunny day with no wind, you’re fine. Unless a flock of birds happen to fly over your vehicle. It sometimes takes multiple requests for unit to recognize simple commands. Often unit cuts out for no reason. It’s quite possibly the most frustrating, disappointing device I’ve ever had the displeasure of owning. Amazon should recall and refund all early units sold.",1,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0
"While the concept is great, having Alexa in your car responding to your voice hands-free, in practice it has a lot of problems. Every time you get in and out of the car the Echo looses connection and takes a long time to reconnect. For several minutes, (I counted over 10 minutes one time) Echo Auto can not reconnect to the phone. I have tried several different phones just to be sure it was not a phone problem. I have tried leaving Echo Auto powered on while I am out of the car and powering it off, (my accessory outlet can be left powered on when when the engine is shut off). No matter what I try Echo keeps responding with ""I have lost connect to the phone"" or "" I have lost connection to the network"". I have the simplest connection possible using the Echo Auto connect to my car by Aux cable and using bluetooth only to connect Echo Auto to my phone. There is no chime or any kind of alert as to when it finally reconnects. I have to keep asking Alexa to play music and it keeps responding it has lost connection, finally after several minutes it will start playing music again. Also at seemingly random times as I am driving Alexa just won't respond. There is no ambient sound problem and nothing to interfere with Alexa hearing me, she just doesn't respond for several minutes. I'll turn down the volume to make sure it can hear me and get no response. I'll keep trying and after several minutes it will start working again. This is definitely not worth the price with all the frustration this thing causes. At $25 this is over priced, at $50 you should expect a lot more.",2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

I wish these echo autos still came with the stick on silicon mounting pad when they initially came out. Those mounting pads are ideal for mounting the echo auto where you can “hardwire” it for a clean cable free look.

The surprise added bonus was I can switch it between my two cars without going through a reset.  One of my cars is a Honda and the other is a Nissan.  I never expected that!  I have a lot of home automation. I unlock my front door or open my garage as I turn down my street as well as turn on lights, set my home temperatures, turn on my TV, listen to music or the news, add to my shopping list, get driving directions, ask questions..

Three out of five days last week, it would stop playing my music and ignore my commands to play. It acts like it is going to listen, then doesn't respond.

Although this then corrects the issue, it is irritating that every time I turn on my vehicle, I have to connect, turn off my bluetooth, turn it back on, and then reconnect, just to get my music to stream without any skipping issues.

"This product was kinda bad during beta phase, but amazon worked them out and is approved each day. The install is easy i set it up through Bluetooth and also by aux, worked great both ways. The thing that was bad was the adhesive used on plastic round wire organizer or the thing that hold the wire fell off the same day; but it was understandable because the car heats up here in the desert to 120-150 degrees in the car. (something that should be work out or maybe screwed on instead glues b/c of extreme weather conditions. A lot of people where upset about not being selected for the beta phase, but the sign up was a year or more before the product came out. The product work with your cell phone connection so if you parked in front of your house with your phone on WiFi and the wave do not reach to were you are parked, Alexa will not connect. You need to be sure to turn your WiFi off so it can connect to cell phone tower and in that same not if you connected to WiFi and drive off you will temporary get d/c. If you have a family and everyone is yelling Alexa will still hear you pretty well and at times she may not respond because a/c vent is blowing in the mic, you can hit the button and she will go in listen mode. Of course the artificial inelegance is not yet perfected but it is approved on everyday, I love to use it to listen to music hands free and get direction to places I can not find.

"When the echo auto works its handy. But more often then not it doesnt work right and it take some tinkering to get functional. Eveytime i get in and start my car the echo says it lost connection to the app, and it requires me to force stop and reopen the amazon app for it to be able to connect again (even if it was only off for a minute or two like when getting gas). To have to restart and open the amazon app everytime i get in the car defeats the whole convienience of having the echo in the first place. Secondly the vent mount is not vey well designed, with the echo attached the assembly is ratber heavy and forces the vent its attached to to sag all the way down almost to the point of the mount falling off altogether (simple fix would be to offer an optional dash mount. But no such product exists).",2,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"It’s clunky. Which it could easily integrate with my car wifi instead of relying on my phone. Also cumbersome that it needs to use either Bluetooth or AUX connection to be heard...cannot listen to radio and just ask Alexa a question. I guess it’s a clunky workaround....not very useful unless you think ahead and change your audio settings every time you use it...unless you listen to music through Alexa ....but why doesn’t the clean music setting ever work ???.Might work for others ok, no technical issue just the concept is limited.....so for me it’s meh but I guess as good as you could expect it to work.",2,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I bought this with such excitement. I had purchased a third party similar device (Roav Viva) and my biggest complaint with that one was there were only 2 mics and it didn't always hear me. Although after having this for several weeks, I am very disappointed. The third party device would automatically open the app needed in the background once it connected with my phone where echo auto does not. I also have constant issues with using other apps (I.E. Spotify, maps, etc.) As echo auto continues to disconnect without the Alexa app open in foreground. I am however happy with the increased mics that pick up my voice over road noises.",1,1,2019-10-11,1,1,0
"Perhaps I could have read the actual product description more closely, but when I made the purchase it seemed pretty clear that Echo Auto was a way to bring Alexa to your car, using your cell service on your phone.  What was not so clear was that you had to have the Alexa app OPEN on your phone (with your phone unlocked and active), AND I had to have my radio switched to the auxiliary input to get any sound to sync at all.  This defeated the purpose of having voice commands entirely for me.  I essentially had to set up Alexa before every car ride - first by switching my input (keeping me from listening to the radio in the car), then by unlocking my phone (and iPhone), and THEN by opening the Alexa app.  It was not convenient for me at all.If the concept was, “plug an Alexa Echo Dot into your car” and the device works exactly like an Echo Dot, then it would be convenient and I would use it every day.  Unfortunately, Echo Auto is basically “use the Alexa app, but with an added small electronic device attached to your dashboard.”  It doesn’t really add any value to the Alexa app as a stand alone service.",1,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I find this item hard to use and connect to. I also don't understand the need to have two cables attached to it at all times in a world where wireless has become the norm. It was very hard to connect to initially and I don't know that it does any more for me than Alexa does on my phone. In addition, the fact that the mount bracket only fits a few vent options and does not have a magnetic or adhesive option, is beyond me. I cannot mount this to my car and it slides all around. Had I known all of this, I would not have ordered it.",2,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
I really wanted to like this but i dont. Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints. I would stay far away from this device amazon sells other car devices with alexa and they seem to work better then this one. Unfortunately this has WAY turned me off to buying the newest product on the market from now on i will hold off at least a year before i buys anything with the amazon name linked to it.FYI every employee i talked with anout this product had NO IDEA what i was talking about. I must have been transferred 6 times before someone at least pretended to know what they where talking about. Turn down the volume!

Then my iPhone wants to start playing music from my phone which I have to stop then wait for Alexa to take over. I have to ask simple questions to see when it is finally connected, like what time is it? Maybe ask 4 times and then I can hear it over the car stereo. Then often it loses connection info and I ask what time is it and it’s 6 hours ahead. I ask for weather and it says it doesn’t know where I am and I should enter my address in the Alexa app which it already is.  Then it will ask what location do I want weather for.

"First, I'll let you know that I am mostly ""all in"" on Alexa/Echo products.  I have five Echo's around the house, including an echo show in the kitchen.  I was an early adopter of this and it has been fantastic around the house.Now the Echo Auto I read about and was skeptical about since 1, initial reviews weren't great and 2, largely - even with my old 2011 Ford - connection through bluetooth only took a few seconds, and was pretty easy without an Echo in the car.  So in short, I have to do the same thing I did before having an Echo Auto - connect to bluetooth from the radio to my phone - before the Echo Auto can do anything and hear my voice prompts.  THEN, even when connected, it is spotty on whether it is connected.  ""I'm having trouble connecting right now.""  What?  I just connected my phone to the radio, and you're connected in the Alexa App to my phone so WHAT's the TROUBLE?""  It's inexpensive but not worth the trouble until they work out some kinks.

It also allows me to answer incoming phone calls hands free by simply saying ""Alexa, answer the phone!""

Voice recognition works better than my 2018 totota's built in Bluetooth system. Set up was easy and my phone auto connects. I'm not very tech savvy and didn't use Alexa before, but this was easy to pick up and figure out. I love the echo auto and am so glad Amazon created it.

Overall, it's not too bad of a product, but I find that a lot of times, I have to revert to using Siri for things like navigation prompts, message dictation, and a host of other things that I was really expecting this device to be able to do a lot better than it actually does.",3,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"UPDATE: After posting this review Amazon Tech Support contacted me and after some troubleshooting got my Echo Auto up and running again. I very much appreciate the proactive call and fix.I really liked the idea of the Amazon Echo Auto, I have many other echo devices, thought this would be a great addition. I was fortunate enough to get an invite to pick the device up at 50% off. As with the other Echo devices, the voice recognition, the sound quality and the overall integration of Alexa was great. The form factor is nice, the wires wrap up under the device stand so it's not a mess on your dashboard. The down side is the device became more of a hinderance and headache. Starting up the car it wouldn't connect to my phone, I would have to reboot the Echo, then wait a minute, then I would have to select the device on my phone's bluetooth list. While driving it would work very well then it would lose connection. Anytime I got out of the car for any length of time and got back in I would have to go through this whole connection cycle. As of now, the Echo Auto cannot connect to the Alexa app on my phone. I tried to reset it up as a new device but it just doesn't come up in the app at all.",2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

There's not even an ""I'm sorry"" canned response.  It will light up like it heard ""Alexa"" but then just gives up.  Commands it does understand are frequently misunderstood.  Mostly I was hoping to use to it to control podcast listening and it's almost useless at doing that.  And lastly, it just doesn't look sleek or sexy in the car.

At times the audio seems to drop for the caller on the other end. I have been told during several calls that the mic drops out. I switch to the phone and then they can hear me. Might be the Bluetooth getting interference. The form factor is nice. Its nice to feel like i've upgraded the car to more recent technology. I am sure by the 2nd generation this thing will be better.

Nation Wide has a free promotion so I did not pay for it. It took some time to setup. They don’t give you directions for setup. You have to be on cellular data and have Bluetooth on. Apparently iPhone’s have a longer setup time. It is ok. I used it briefly. I had to have it plugged into a power source and the aux jack and I don’t have normal airvents so it does not stay upright when I turn.  I cannot use it in my other car because you have to have Bluetooth or an aux jack. So you cannot use it in older standard cars.

I shouldn’t be forced to be on a specific input as it really steals my choices and functionality down. The microphones aren’t strong enough to pickup my voice and I find myself having to yell.

If I’m leaving the house and notice I forgot to turn some lights off, I can tell echo auto to turn them off without having to go back in the house or get my phone out and do it manually.

I have to open the app on my phone, wait a bit, and then close the app. Then...Alexa will *usually* work again. Not always though. Sometimes it's just a perpetual, ""lost connection to your phone"" message.When the thing works - it's fun. I like to be able to easily access my Amazon music and play specific songs or playlists.

At one point it did go past that, & I thought it might work, but it didn’t & when I got out of my car & back in, I had to go through the whole set up process again! It still doesn’t work! I even hooked it up with the Aux cable to no avail! Frustrated!",1,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"I just received an installed my Echo Auto.  I have waiting for months since I first accepted the invitation to be on of the first to receive this new item.  It was very easy to install, connected to my car and my phone very easily.  The Echo Auto does a good job picking up my voice.  I have tried many functions and everything works great.  Alexa can provide all of the info that a regular Echo does.  It works seamlessly with my Amazon Music unlimited account and gives me access to millions of songs.  I also can control my smart home devices from my car.  I also tried drop in with my other devices and it worked well.  It is nice to retrieve an add calendar entries or add to a shopping or to do list while I am driving.  I am very pleased with this purchase",5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"I have an iPhone. Set up seemed to be going fine, but kept getting stuck at certain steps in the process. It took me a total of about 90 minutes across three days to get it to complete set up and then actually play (and when it did work, there was no clear reason why it worked that time and not the other 300 times I tried to get it to work). That was achieved yesterday morning so I used it while driving to work. At lunch time, I got in my car to run some errands, and the Echo Auto failed to connect., and I spent a lot of time troubleshooting to no avail. Then again after work, I spent 20 minutes in the parking lot trying to get it to work, and again no luck.Based on my experience, it is an annoying worthless piece of **** that I deeply regret purchasing.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"The device works great as a Bluetooth to headphone auxiliary input to play music from my iPhone. The Alexa functionality is pretty good, but you have to make sure the Alexa app is open in the background. I tend to close apps I’m not using.The reason I took off a star is due to the lack of integration with iOS. You can’t use Alexa voice commands to open any other apps, or make non-echo phone calls/send text messages. Alexa’s voice recognition is superior to Siri, but Siri allows me to access the additional functions of my phone.",4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Ok, first off I don't get all the negative reviews, yes the instructions are bad, yes the mount could be better however once programmed it connects to my iPhone within 5 seconds of starting the engine EVERY TIME. Unlike the home echo's that allow you to speak your command immediately after saying Alexa with this one you must wait until you hear the ""Ding"".Yes I do feel it should have a better mount or more options for it and better instructions I like it a lot, that being said I did get it at the $25 invite price and not sure at this point if it is worth the regular $50 price tag without improvements..",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Update:  Changing my review.  Alexa is so dumb.  It can only answer direct questions, when I asked :""how far is place B from place A, it says:"" sorry I don't know that!""  google could answer this question easily.  I am returning this unit!I have several echos at home, I'm so used to Alexa.  I always wonder if there's Alexa for Auto and then I saw this.  The sound quality is pretty good, I also tested the navigation as well today.  Overall I think it's a good purchase!  The only thing I don't like it is not cordless!",2,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"This product works about 10% of the time. The remainder of the time it either doesn’t activate with the wake word, doesn’t know what you’re asking, or tells you to ask later. This product needs some serious patch work and bug fixes. Also the GPS integration is a joke. I’m driving around lost, ask the thing to find me a gas station, and it asks me to unlock my phone. Not a great hands free option.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"Love that it works through the car stereo.  However, since my car automatically connects to my phone I wish the Auto Echo would also automatically connect without my having to press the ""I'm a Passenger"" warning before use.Another great secret.

"Can be a little glitchy at times and Alexa sometimes misunderstands verbal requests, repeating yourself can be annoying but overall it’s GREAT to have Alexa in the car! It makes it easier to make hands free calls, hear the weather, google info and play amazon playlists (and add fav songs to existing playlists :) All while driving and never having to look down or fuss with radio stations. We have Alexa in our home, makes everything easier having her in the car also. Nothing beats voice command for flexibility and safety on the road!",4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"I have a 2016 honda fit which actually connects to my phone decently. When I installed the Echo Auto, I was not impressed. I think overall it's really alexa who I am more annoyed with. She never understands any spotify playlists I ask her to play. As for the Auto functionality.... I ended up only using it to change spotify playlists. I might put this in my basement to act like a basic alexa device to control the lights or wait till i rebuild another classic car and use this in it (I think this is where it will shine). If your vehicle has bluetooth connectivity and you can speak through it to your phone... you essentially have this device.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"This device has a ton of potential so let me start with what it does well.  Voice recognition is good considering the ambient noise while driving in a car.  Saying ""Alexa"" then issuing a command is much safer than pressing a button to control a device or issue a command.  I can send announcements to all other echo devices in my home while driving which is handy.  I can drop in on a specific echo device while driving, however, the devices in my home can't drop-in on my echo auto which is unfortunate.  I can't even rename my echo auto device to ""Dad's Car"" so my kids can drop in on it.  The biggest problem with this device, in my opinion, is that it doesn't come with an Android / Apple Car app.  It tries to send directions to Apple maps but fails.  It tries to play music on connected music service apps but it doesn't work reliably enough.  If Amazon makes an app specifically to make driving while listening to music a great user experience then this device will be as successful as their other echo devices, otherwise, I think it will fade out into a small niche market.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
L LOVE Alexa Everywhere!! Always room for improvement with a new product. But this is pretty freaking awesome!

"I am pretty satisfied with Alexa for the car.  There are a few glitches that need to be fixed in future generations.  One is that every time I get in my car, I have to go through my car's stereo system, pick bluetooth, then pick which phone to use, and connect it.  There is also a lag when one says 'Alexa' and a beep before you can start asking or talking to it.  My home Alexa do not have that issue.  My last glitch is that the vent holder that came with it sucks.  Its always falling off.  While my friend who got the first ones out by invitation, has a fixed mount that adheres to the dashboard.  I will be making my own for that to compensate for the vent holder.  The Alexa works well for calls, music and navigation.  Since I dont have navigation on my screen on my car, this is an absolute wonderful thing, so now I dont have to deal with my phone when I want to bring up google maps etc. I just say, Alexa, directions to ???.  Works like a charm.  This product would have got a 5 star if it didnt have those inconvenient glitches.",3,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"I may misunderstand Alexa Auto's functionality.  But I thought I could ask for directions to a place and Alexa would activate either Waze or Google Maps to provide the directions. My Alexa Auto did not do that 100% of the time. Alexa Auto  would tell me where the closest location of the same grocery store was, but not the location that I requested in a town 15 miles away. Tried using the name of the town and both the street and the town.",1,1,2019-12-10,1,2,0
"First of all, it took a while to set up in the automobile. We followed the directions exactly but had so much trouble hooking up the Bluetooth to it. After we finally did so, it seems to work OK. Sometimes you have to repeat commands over and over a few times.  When we're in the car on a long trip, we try to play Jeopardy or some other game and it will just go off and go back to the music we were listening before hand without warning. It's almost like it's a prototype and it doesn't work 100% because it is a brand new Product.  I have no complaints with my Alexa echoes in my house, but the one in the car does not seem to work 100% and it needs to be improved.",3,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Voice trumps all in the car. Echo auto is the only truly hands-free solution for interacting with technology in my car.

I can check the weather, stocks, stats, the latest news headlines or get the answer to the random question I just thought of - without having to wait to get home and ask Google.  If I'm bored after all of that, I can invoke any of the 1000s of Alexa skills to keep me entertained.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0

With limited travel for 4 months because of Cov-19, now traveling again i see i miss the unit,  I would like to replace, when it worked it was a great help in the Car.  I was unable to tell anyone the issue except to wright it in a review.  Hopefully Amazon reads this and will make contact about the replacement or where to send for repair.  Issues happen , and I understand however Customer Service contact is tough.",1,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0

"I've used the unit for about a month now and believe its just an OK product at this time.  I am using it with an iPhone 6s.  One feature i wish it had, but is not supported, is sending a text message by voice through the iPhone.  Siri is sub-par at this and i was hoping to replace her.  My hunch is this is Apple's restriction, not Amazon's.  The Alexa app needs to be running in the background in order for the unit to work while driving.  It's not a big deal but sometimes it is not started and therefore the unit does not respond when I interact with it.  Also, the app, once opened, always assumes i'm driving.  So if i'm just moseying around the house and i try to use the app I get a warning screen saying i cannot use the app while driving.  A simple close/reopen of the app fixes the issue.  My family uses Alexa to coordinate reminders and having this unit definitely helps as I can send a reminder while driving as i think of it...where more times than not I would forget by the time I get to my destination.  My kids, 9,9 and 11 enjoy the capability of playing their music just by a simple voice command.  Though, i must say i'm tired of hearing the same Aladdin songs over and over ;o).  When you say the wake word, it seems to take a split second longer for her to wake up then the in-house units.  This often causes the kids to have to repeat their commands a second time.  Our unit is mounted via a vent clip in the center of our console.  The placement is as fairly unobtrusive and i think they did a good job at this for their first go-round.  The blue light that animates during discussions definitely reminds me of Knight Rider...so the option to have a red light with Kit's voice would be a pretty cool feature.  Overall I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because i haven't spent the time trying to integrate it with my Pod Casts nor researched how to integrate it with Waze.  So I'll assume its my fault for not trying vs. functions not being supported.  If you can get a Black Friday deal of 1/2 off i'd go for it just for the novelty, plus you know Amazon will improve upon it.  But if you think the price is a bit high, then i'd skip for now as i'm not sure it's worth it just yet.",3,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"Echo Auto device wouldn't work with my old LG phone: constantly losing its connection, constantly not responding to voice commands (""play songs by artist"" = nothing), etc... I gave it to my wife who's had more luck with her Samsung Galaxy. Since then I got a receiver (Kenwood  DPX304MBT) with Alexa built-in and a new phone (Google Pixel 3a), hoping it would work better, but all the same issues are there and are worse. It responds to my first command (""play songs by artist"") but then stops responding, just ""listening"". When I get to my destination and turn off the car, then return to the car, Alexa just says ""disconnected"" and it turns out my phone has entirely forgotten the device and it has to be reinstalled. All of this, in addition to the extremely poor audio quality when it does work, make the Echo Auto a huge disappointment.",1,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"Technically works, most of the time.  If Alexa hears me but decides not to answer for whatever reason, I don't always get feedback that she's not going to do as instructed.  All the people that I call think I have them on speaker phone because the background sound is awful.  I plug this in my aux port using a ground noise isolator I used with my other bluetooth device.

When you listen to an audiobook through Echo Auto (or other Alexa devices apparently) it doesn't remember where you are in the book to sync with the Audible app to continue listening outside of the vehicle. This is a huge disappointment as my primary reason for purchasing was to listen to audiobooks while traveling across country. Connectivity via bluetooth was slow to integrate but once it finally connected was okay. Also when you reach or travel through an area with no cell signal you've got no Echo Auto. I hope Amazon can get the bugs worked out as the idea is great.,3,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"This was exactly what I needed! Echo Auto met my expectations and I am very pleased with my purchase. I am using it in a 2006 Honda Civic that is not Bluetooth enabled, so the echo is working from the AUX port. I have listened to podcasts, music through Spotify, talked on the phone and with Google Duo. The clarity both ways is great. My only complaint is that most of the Alexa customizations that can be done from within the app, aren't available as options for the Echo Auto - two main examples are changing the wake word, and the continuous response (ie not having to say ""Alexa"" before each command)",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0

When asked to navigate to them or back to home, it opens navigation in Google Maps on my Pixel 3a.  It also plays music and Podcasts as requested and works my smart devices at home (ex: turn on/off lights).  We actually haven't had any problems with function or requests.  It even picks up hearing a request from the kids in the back of my minivan.",4,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0

Love that it's synced to my music app I can play whatever my heart desires with just a quick command. Makes driving handsfree much easier. The only issues I have with this buddy is connection can be spotty and it doesn't always reconnect with my phone when I get in the car.

"I don’t write a lot of reviews, but this thing is freakin awesome. If you aren’t really much of an Alexa user then it won’t matter much to you, but if you’re home automation is built around Amazon Alexa and you don’t have Alexa in your car then I don’t know what you’re doing with your life. It’s a super cheap way to integrate Alexa into your car. I can turn my lights on as I pull in the driveway. I can turn my thermostat up so my house is warm by the time I get home. I can access my entire music library and the sound quality is great. I can listen to my Audible Audio Books. Anything you can do at home with Echo you can now do in your car. It makes and receives phone calls with a built in speaker phone too, but people I talk to have told me that it’s hard to hear me when I use the speaker phone, so I guess that’s my only complaint, but if you already have a good hands free option in the car then you won’t need this for that.

Additionally, Alexa just wasn't very good and executing the things I wanted it to, like starting navigation, recognizing my contacts or playing music from specific apps.I gave up on this device and it's just sitting in a drawer now.",3,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
No touchscreen on this device. The external device is beautiful. I think the next iteration should be as big as the car power plug with a ring around it and two USB ports for external power. The cables are a bit messy when mounting the device. The rubber stop didn’t keep its hold in the late Arizona summer. I love the alexa integration. Bluetooth connectivity and phone connectivity works fairly well. The speed of connection is new and could be better. I do not think that is an issue with the device.

It would be nice if she was her own speaker as well, so you didn't have to ALWAYS be connected to her to use her.  She came with a AUX cable but she doesn't work with it, had to use USB.  I would have preferred to use the AUX and free up my USB port.",3,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
It is very cool and functions great with the exception on deadzone areas which do not occur with my phone or any other device. Periodically the Echo-Auto will respond with “Having difficulty connecting to the network” it seems to be in the same areas - my phone reception is great during those times so the Alexa integration is the problem.Most of the time it works great and the sound quality and voice recognition is pretty sweet. They just need to fix the Glitch that occurs sometimes for no reason - even when you have good phone reception. I still like it.,4,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"I think the headline sums it up pretty well - when it works, it's great. However, Alexa for Echo Auto likes to take breaks. Maybe she needs to step out for a smoke, I don't know, but often when we say ""Alexa"" we get a flat tone beep that lets us know she needs another minute in the restroom. The five stars for sound quality is more a rating for my car's speakers, which are quite good, than it is for Echo Auto's sound. Using Echo Auto for directions is infuriating at best. I'm not sure but maybe she feels like she deserves a raise because the only place she likes to tell me to go is Hell when I ask for directions. Future iterations of Echo Auto might be great.

"This device was once thought of the holy grail of automotive smart assistance retrofit integration. You just plug it in to a 12v power port and connect the Bluetooth of your vehicle or plug in an auxiliary audio cable. There could be a lot of software improvements to fix the current shortcomings.

If you try to ask Alexa without it, you will get a notification asking to open the Alexa app when it is safe to do so.

"All-in-all, it's not too bad. It does what I want it to do.  If you like your home Alexa, you'll like your Auto Alexa.  There's really only one issue...  The voice recognition is terrible!  To be more specific, Alexa can't always translate what I say.I know how it works...  I say ""Alexa"" and wait for the beep.  Then, I say ""Shuffle songs by Post Malone"" (not that I would ever say that, but you get the idea.)  Anyway, then, Alexa sends that little soundbite of me talking to the Cloud where it gets translated into computer speak, the command is created, and is executed.  Alexa is just a fancy receiver for me to talk to and to talk to me.  However, the fact that an upload of my voice is required completely hamstrings the Auto experience.  If you're driving, some places have better cell signals than others.  If I'm in an area with a poor signal, Alexa can't even translate what I have to say, let alone actually execute it.

I do not like Echo Auto and I'm so disappointed because I was really excited about it. I have Bluetooth in my truck and the newest model of my phone so I was surprised that I had to work so hard to connect it the first time... and then all the other times. Going through the whole setup every single time is time consuming and I just want to get in my vehicle and go. When we did get it to work the directions were terrible and helping me find a gas station or anything like that was terrible.The auxiliary cord never worked.

I enjoy integrating Alexa into my life as it makes things so much easier. I like being able to turn on my lights before getting out of my car without having to get my phone out. My vehicle has constant power to the outlet so it never turns off so it has caused issues with it pairing when I leave and reenter its range. I've had to unplug it after every stop and then it has issues pairing with my phone again. I've tried to have it set to disconnect when at a specific location but the range it too large that it disconnects before I want. I'm sure there is a way to correct this but I'm unable to figure it out. For vehicle that shut off power to plug when turned off shouldn't have this issue. I'm going to set up a second one for my wife's car. Worthy addition to vehicles without bluetooth via the aux cord and wanting to stream music.,4,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

"If you like gadgets, this is fun to play with but don't take it too seriously. It can be very frustrating  at times but no different than any other of the Alexa voice command product. I have several in my home so I knew what I was getting into. They are great when they work. For some reason the Echo Mobile is a little more problematic. Still have a lot of bugs to work out. That statement came from them, not me. All in all, it's a great product especially if you don't have a vehicle with USB voice calling. I have an older truck which does not have all the modern tech. I can now make hands free calls.",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,1
"For starters the menu is jacked. You will see a list of all sorts of Alexa products it’s not there. You need to go under another category to find the auto just to sync it to the car. Minor but no instructions so annoying. Also Alexa understands about 70% of what you are asking. If she can’t reach the network which is 90% of the time it will just default to your iTunes or whatever music app has other music on there. I want to like this. I hope it gets better, but I don’t see that happening. This is junk and I’d rather have my money back.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"Like: Air vent mount is sturdy and isn't bulky or ugly. Unit boots very quickly. Very sleek overall design. 12 volt plug has a second, unused USB power outlet. Microphone works well. Audio quality via cable out is very good and package includes an external ground loop noise filter.If you learn to work with its shortcomings, it is a nice addition to vehicle.Dislike: The Alexa app must be running on your smart device (can be in the background) and sometimes has to be closed and reopened before device will function. You won't know that until you start driving and use the wake word only to find that the device can't connect to the internet, leaving you to fumble with your device while driving to relaunch the app. The air vent mount has a rubber cable management clip that detached from my device after a few days. It uses adhesive instead of a mechanical connection, and after the bakes everything the glue loses its grip. If you speak to Alexa per Amazon's recommendations, which is to state, ""Alexa something something something"" without a pause after the wake word, this device will often miss your question entirely. This is especially frustrating because you see the ""listening"" light illuminate to indicate the wake word did its job, however after a few seconds the light goes out and nothing happens. This is distracting while driving because you have to restate your question. My advice is to say the wake word, glance at the indicator light to make sure it was heard, then state your request. This has to be done quickly enough to not lose the session but slow enough to work. Doable, but not as smooth as other Alexa devices. Finally, the external ground loop filter is bulky and should have been built into the device.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
My car is over 10 years old and did not have the the connections that the newer cars have. So when I saw the Alexa echo auto I knew I had to try it! It works great now when I read my audible books it’s doing it through my car stereo. I can also ask ask Alexa what the time is what the temperature is it’s just like my Alexa At home. I love this new gadget!! It is very small And very convenient. Thank you thank you thank you for inventing this great product!!!The echo auto is amazing!! It is also very very reasonable in price which makes it that much better!,5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"It's fun and easy to use, that's for sure.  It's nice to have to keep hands free and eyes off your device when you are driving.  However, I find it best for music.  I have an iPhone and listen to podcasts often on my commute.  The problem with this device is I can't choose which episode I want to listen to.  And, if I don't finish my podcast on my drive, it does keep a memory of where I last listened.  The other issue is texting.  It makes voice texting easy while driving.  However, if your recipient does not have Alexa texting set up on their phone, it does not work well.  So, I use it sometimes and stick with Siri.",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
Was not very happy with this . I was able to get this as a invite . Well at first it was real nice and perfect everything worked just fine would connect to my phone fast . Then after a couple days just didn’t want to connect anymore I kept trying to restart it but nothing so I gave up then tried a couple days later and it worked again. Then it said it couldn’t connect to my phone one more time after that . It’s just a bit frustrating I never have any problems with my tap and the music but with this device wouldn’t let me play the same music as my tap and I am paying for it each month to have it do not sure there . Anyways I hope they keep improving this cause it sounds like a real good idea to have with u in your car just not when it’s going to be giving u so much hassle when u got placed to be and can’t take 10-15 minutes trying to make it work . Also needs a more secure clip keeps falling off . She also takes just a lil while to get back to you after u ask her something so be patient not to long but it’s ok . So overall it needs more work for right now 2 starts please improve .,2,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0

"As an early Amazon product adopter I was excited about the Amazon version of an auto product. In my car I was previously using the Garmin Speak w/ Amazon Alexa and before it was introduced I was using an Echo Dot tethered to my phone's hotspot with a VPN to my home network (To get complete integration with my other IoT devices). I tested the Echo Auto in my Jeep Grand Cherokee for 2 weeks going to work, home, and errands.So full disclosure the Echo Auto tethers itself to your phone and uses your data for it's use and this may be an issue for some. The software setup was easy and placing it in my car was easier as it was small and light enough to snap into a vent.",1,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0

Otherwise, it's not worth the hassle it takes to make it work.After my last review customer service called me and walked me through an install.

One reason I bought it was my new van didn’t come with Bluetooth, I was shocked it’s a 2019 too, so I got it and It replaces blue tooth but goes beyond, just like the Alexa dot home with all of its features. I use it daily for calls, directions as well as playing play lists I’ve created online with amazon music or adding them to a list while I am listing. I love requesting advice, playing Alexa games as well! I’ve cancelled Sirius because there is no need when you have it all in this device...my only advice is...the ability to change her name to what I want, I’d like a guy , like Javier ...hahaha",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto was very easy to install, both to connect to my iPhone and to attach the stand to my air vent. After that, it pretty much works like any Echo device. The only exception—and it takes a little getting used to—is waiting for the tone after you say “Alexa” before you ask your question. Also, you’ll need to bone up on how to ask for specific recordings by artists if you want to hear a particular album (I’m still working on that myself but I can practice that indoors.) The only other thing I could mention is if you want driving directions, you’ll need to have your phone handy to touch the notification button once you make your request.The only con—the cord.

"The system seems to work well, albeit not perfect, and not really expected to be.  The installation was a tad tedious as the cell phone link wasn't exactly as expected.  Have not yet been able to link Echo Auto to the cell GPS, so it never knows where we are, and consequently can't tell me the nearest ... whatever I'm looking for.  It seems that I can have active Echo, or active audio, radio, Sirius XM, etc, but not both at the same time.  But my system was just reset when my mechanic did an oil change, and I've lost other features momentarily, so that may be it.  Playing music thru Auto burns some bandwidth on my cell contract, so I keep it to a minimum.  Nonetheless, it's great to be able to have many of the Echo features in the car, even though there seems to be a few seconds of time delay for Auto's checkback via Echo at my base location.

I like the chime as it turns on (power outlet is supplied when the door opens on my vehicle).  The biggest issue I have is not with Alexa but the time it takes sometimes for my car to pair with my phone.

"I received the invitation on August, at first I was really excited for this because my car stereo is simple and thought this would be an improvement, but I was wrong. I'm really disappointed, the first (and main) problem was that it randomly disconnected from the alexa app on my phone, and said ""connection lost"", and had to open the app and wait until it connected again; then when asking for directions, for example, to the nearest gas station, instead of taking me to such, it was telling me to go to a station that was more than 30 miles away from me. Another thing was that if I was driving on the freeway or more than 50 mph, Alexa couldn't hear me even with my windows up and yelling. There are more minor details that can be improved, but I would just recommend waiting to see if they improve it or make a new version of it, meanwhile just use google assistant or siri.",3,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0

It's probably due to the ""road"" noise, etc because I don't have the same problems in my house. The one ""complaint"" I have is ""Alexa"" is the only wake up word.

At least that was before it died after one year and 9 days.  Now it won't connect to my phone.  May change the rating after I talk to Amazon.  Only other complaint is the mounting options.  they are poor unless you like having wires running everywhere.

Sometimes the answer is ""Open your Alexa app first"" or ""the connection with your phone"", then you have to open your Alexa app to get it working. And even with that sometimes it still won't work.On the positive note, once the device gets connected, it's wonderful.

You can also create memos, timers, shopping lists, have directions pulled onto your phone, and all the alexa stuff while driving and without the use of your hands.My minor issues are that sometimes Alexa doesnt hear me, or alexa will hear her wake word ""Alexa"" while I'm listening to music or an Audiobook and she will pause whatever I'm listening to, so that she can wait for a command.  There is nothing 100% perfect in the world and these issues are far and few in between that I can live with them.

It made no difference where I was, the issue existed 10 miles from home as well as in my driveway.

The main reason for buying was to be more hands free and honestly, Siri does a better job. With iOS 13, Siri will play music on Pandora from voice commands.I have echos I’m every room of my house but Amazon, you’re gonna have to do much better than this if you want to compete with iPhone users.

This needs more work...The unit connects quickly and easily every time I'm in the car...but half the time it says I need to turn the Alexa app on my phone on - when u do that it reminds you to use only if a passenger...I don't want to turn the app on while driving - I want Alexa to come on so I can provide commands.  So I have to turn the app on my phone for it to work in the car.  Easier to just use Siri on the phone.  Nice concept - but I this needs more work..also half the time Alexa gets the commands wrong.,2,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
I really wanted this to work.  It would be nice if it either had some memory cache or the app cached a few minutes of your songs. You dont want your music to stop just because you drive under an over pass. or in traffic next to a semi.I'ts hung on my wall for the last few months.

"My 2015 Chevy Equinox will only allow one bluetooth connection which was my phone and so I had to use the jack/cable to connect this Alexa.  Its hard for the voice to understand my requests.  It sometimes stops playing during a song to have me start the connection process all over again, I have to really turn up the volume load to hear the music and then there is a background hum or buzz.  It would have been nice to connect it directly to my car instead of through a jack cable.  Couce recognition needs tweeking.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

What did they expect when a device has 6 microphones and some buttons. If it was smaller, you probably couldn't even press the buttons on it xDSpeaking of the buttons... I never used them.

"Overall, I'm happy I bought the Echo Auto. It solved a major need for me: an easy way to connect my phone to my (older) car via Bluetooth. Prior to now, I've always had to plug a bunch of cables into my phone when I got in the car, which is a pain.Alexa is good at finding my voice, even when music is playing, so that's impressive and helpful. I still find Alexa a bit harder to use than other voice assistants. It's good at commands, but not so good at general inquiries (call local store, etc). I frequently use it to initiate phone calls and play music. It does seem to prefer Amazon music and I find it slightly frustrating to have to specify ""Resume Playing Spotify"".",4,1,2020-5-21,1,0,1
"Love the idea, but not the execution. First, it’s very easy to connect and set up. But, there’s a HUGE difference in sound volume. I have to turn my volume up so high I about have a heart attack when I forget and switch back to my radio. Switching to aux mode and being able to hear Alexa requires unplugging and then plugging back in the aux cord. My vehicle does not recognize Alexa until I do this. I tried a Bluetooth adapter and had the same problem. Maybe my 2014 Suburban just isn’t technologically advanced enough to use this.",2,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this but it works great for the most part. Although I understood it used your cell phone I didn't understand that it would constantly use your cell phone as a conduit to all functions and use your cell data when stream music, etc. So in that sense it's more like a remote control to the Alexa app on your phone then a seperate device like the dot. When asking for directions it's a bit spotty - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't - so I deducted a star for that.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
I got the auto through the invite. I wanted to wait a few weeks before I post a review because I wanted to make sure I really had a chance to test it.I liked the idea of getting Alexa in the car.

"This is great, when it works. It struggles over and over to connect to my phone, and sometimes I have to completely delete it from the app and start setup from scratch. Definitely does not work seamlessly like the regular Echos (I have several and am familiar with their use). Definitely needs a software update to make it work better. Also half the time when I say “Alexa,” I get the blue light but not long enough to tell her what I want. She shuts off right away. So a good idea overall, but very glitchy and needs work.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"I’m a huge Alexa fan. We’ve had our original Alexa since 2014. Since then we’ve added two Echos. I was thrilled about the new Echo Auto. First, we tried using it with my 2012 Equinox. We could not get it to work. Next we tried our 2015 Odyssey. It works but not well. The voice recognition works 25% of the time. The connection keeps dropping. Overall it is not the quality Alexa experience that we are accustomed to. Unfortunately my husband dragged this feet on returning it. He was “certain” he could get it to work.",1,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0

Great way for me to play music via bluetooth on my older Grand Prix without always having to connect the phone with an aux cord.  Sound quality is great.  I can easily play music hands free with Amazon music or play music loaded to my phone (unfortunately can't navigate my own music with Alexa)  Love the ability to make and take calls now hands free.Microphones on the device are very good.  Sound quality on phone calls is very good.  The only negative that i can come up with is that it seems to take a minute or two to connect once you are in the car.  I've used it for a week now and once its connected I've not had any problems with it losing the connection.  Waiting for a Black Friday sale to buy another for my other car.,5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"The Idea of Alexa in the car is a great concept, but it has some ways to go. The mount is large, cumbersome, it renders an air vent useless, and looks just stupid! The device itself is nice looking, but the friggin power wire hanging is annoying (I have bluetooth in the car). Trying to connect to this thing was a nightmare! After three days of trying, I gave up, and just left it setup. Randomly, it connected while I was driving. I have not had the random disconnects like others (thank goodness), but it's sort of cumbersome to operate. Meaning that I have to have it on the Aux. channel to use it, so if I want to listen to the radio I lose the ability to use the device. When asking for directions, I thought it would display the map on the monitor on my radio for a visual reference, but I have to switch back to Auxiliary to hear it which means no radio. I thought that I would like this product and really wanted to , but Google Assistant on my phone and Android Auto is way better, so I will be sticking to what works.",2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

I can ask her to play any song that I request,  give me a weather update, tell me a story, or give me the latest news.The only frustrating thing is when the volume on your phone is turned down.  Then, you can't hear Alexa through your car speakers and you think she's not connected. This is totally a user issue so I give this device 5 stars!",5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"I read at least one review that noted difficulty in integration and setup of this device.  I did not have any issues with setup and integration of my device in my vehicle. We have multiple echo devices in our home and have been utilizing them well for several years. It wasn't until I had the Echo Auto that I realized how much this device can really do. We integrated our Apple Music through the Alexa App, my wife can update her grocery list either at the house (with our home echo devices) and it can be retrieved with the Echo Auto. Also, I can get turn-by-turn directions through the device.  The thing I like the most is now I am truly hands-free when asking Echo Auto for music, etc.  We have a 2006 Land Rover with an audio jack and no Blue Tooth. It has been really wonderful to put this device in our vehicle.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

When it works its nice, however it seems the majority of the time there is connection error, or an app error, or some other error. You have to reset the device each time and sometimes it works when you reconnect. I cannot seem to troubleshoot what causes it to mess up, it seems random.

"When it works it’s great. Can lose signal very easily sometimes you have to turn vehicle off to get it to reconnect makes me want to throw it out the window sometimes. Works well if you have kids you can play games to keep occupied. I hate the clip that goes on vents its not strong enough to stay level and if you have ocd like me the device sitting at a slight angle is very annoying.

I mainly use it to play comedy station on drive to work and play every version of Baby Shark for my kids.",3,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"I did not expect that I would be using Alexa INSTEAD of my radio. Even though I have voice activation in my car, I don't have bluetooth, so I have two cords coming from this little car Alexa, and I have to use the auxiliary input. The vent attachment is also a bit insecure. Yes I can still play my radio by telling Alexa to do it, but I'd rather just turn the radio on. Which means if i DO have something to ask/tell Alexa, I have to change to Aux input. I imagine this may be a lot more user-friendly or helpful for people that do have the bluetooth connection and have a long commute every day - my commute is 3 miles.

"I got the Echo Auto for free as a promotion thru Nationwide Insurance and was curious to give it a try. Set-up is not too bad depending upon your vehicle. I have a Toyota and had to completely remove the EnTune app from my iPhone to get the Bluetooth to pick up the Echo. I am not sure why but it was the only way the Echo could be recognized. You have to have your Audio Source set to Bluetooth for the Echo Auto to work and you also have to have the Alexa App on your phone up and running as well.  The Echo Auto works through the Alexa app on your phone for everything. It basically only uses Bluetooth with your car audio for playback through your car's speakers.  Things like directions, asking for the nearest gas station location, weather, etc work fairly well, but music streaming from Amazon Music or other sources seemed to be fairly spotty, even though I was receiving a solid cell signal on my iPhone.  I keep it, perhaps for use on long trips for gas locations or restaurants.  Yes, you can do all that with your phone. The purpose of the promotion from Nationwide Insurance was the ""handsfree"" aspect of using the Echo Auto.",3,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

This was cool initially. But when it asks you a question it immediately states to “only use amazon echo while your vehicle is not in motion” or something along those lines. I’ve learned since then that you literally answer her question while she’s giving you the warning. We all know you don’t interrupt a woman talking so it took a week or so to realize I’m supposed to talk over her to communicate. We all know this never works in the mans favor. Ultimately it’s ok.

Sometimes it will automatically kick on even without us saying “Alexa...” One day my kids and I were talking in the car and it just started randomly answering questions that we didn't even ask which was creepy.

"For the past 2 years, I've been looking for a device that allowed me to bring Alexa in my car. Living in a city, where commuting anywhere outside my immediate suburb, means spending to as little as 20 to as much as almost an hour in the car, I wanted Alexa to play the artists, news outlets and podcasts I like but don't always have time to listen to through my home Alexa. Not to mention, when my 4-year-old granddaughter is in the car and can make her musical requests that she's used to making from the home Alexa, the ride seems a whole lot shorter for us.I had been an early adopter of another device that advertised that it could bring Alexa into the car.

We tried for several hours. They finally asked me to send it back to their labs which I did.  Since it was clearly useless I certainly didn't mind getting rid of it.

Got two of these for each of my cars. Lots of problems. Some times it doesn’t connect or it connects but no sound. Some times I can see the progress bar ticking but there is no sound. 80% of the time while listening to a prime play list the music stops after every song so I have to hit the play button in order to resume. Same for audiobooks. It never resumes after shutting off the car and starting again.Hope they fix the multitude of problems.

I bought a cassette bluetooth receiver and that solved my issue, however, I learned Alexa does not connect to the Bluetooth receiver directly, it just connects to your phone so everything comes from the phone. Also, Alexa will not respond or activate unless the Alexa app is running or open on your phone. If so, why do I need the device if everything will come from my phone anyway?

"I was extremely excited about getting my echo auto! Spending realistically thousands of dollars on Amazon a year, I’m a very loyal customer so another product from the company was pretty easy for me to make the decision. However, when I got the device and connected it to my car, it wasn’t a very easy process and took almost 45 minutes to connect. After connecting and testing the waters for a few days I came to realize that the device doesn’t not pick up responses easily and is difficult to maintain connection with my phone. My car has to be almost silent for the device to activate by my voice. Then, when it does register my command, it rarely takes action- the echo will act as though it is registering your command for about a minute and then fall silent. I think that Amazon may be on the verge of something great, but I see quite a few improvements needed as well. All in all, compared to the price of the item. You get what you pay for and I would buy it again. It definitely isn’t as helpful as a household echo though.",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

"Echo Auto does what I want it too, play music and call people with my voice, completely hands free. I love it, but it does have moments where I'm yelling and Alexa cant pick up my voice, or maybe a dead spot on the road and alexa cant access internet so shes completely useless. But that is kind of a given, so I dont worry about that too much. She can answers questions, but when u ask for directions she just opens up google maps for you. Which in a way is helpful, but I hope to see them improve it where alexa can read out directions for you. I'd reccomend if you just wanna play songs and call people without using your phone, but if you looking for an AI assistant in your car, I'd hold off for a bit and wait for improvements. Alexa mounts to your air vents and requires a power supply from either a USB or directly into your cigarette lighter.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"This product has made my old car a blue tooth capable vehicle by plugging the aux and power cord in.  It can be frustrating because, it automatically connects when I get in.  If I choose to listen to XM or something instead (since this takes data), I can't hear my phone's  notifications for maps or calls because I've switched the input from aux to XM.  So, unless you are listening to a book or have unlimited data, you have to unplug it or disconnect from the device to hear your phone AND the car radio.  The vent holder is a nice feature but does render the vents unmovable.  Works great for listening to my audio books and talking hands free.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"This is a great product, I wish it came out a long time ago.  Now a days with newer cars coming with built in bluetooth, not sure how well it will sell.

Having Alexa function is bonus.  One of my oldest car does not even have aux in, so I wish this came with FM transmitter.

As mentioned, the written instructions stunk, the app instructions worked well up to getting it to work in the car, the video in the app was of no help and the videos I searched for in YouTube sucked. Returned it the same day. First time I returned something from Amazon. And that went very well. Good luck.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

It works fine until you turn the car off, but once you do that and start the car again it no longer works.

My amazon Alexa auto works great. It is a nice hands free way to make phone calls and play music. For me it is just one less step that I currently already have by hitting a button on my steering when to make phone calls.My biggest gripe is actually with the mount. It is pretty difficult to get it to work with my car vents so I find myself not using it as much as I would otherwise. I'm sure this is not a problem across the board and more specific to my make and model of car (2015 Ford Escape). There are also some problems with connectivity upon leaving and reentering the vehicle.,4,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"Too long to connect when I first get in the car. I had to repeat my instructions several times before she would answer . The GPS integration is horrible, useless. I have an older radio in my car with no Bluetooth , so cable management was an issue... too messy. I found that since I listen to my music in my car rather loudly , I had to scream to get Alexa to respond.

"The major problem with Echo Auto is that it is really NOT an Echo device like Echo Dot or Echo Input. Amazon has been somewhat deceptive about this. It is really not possible for the Echo Auto to give the ""full Echo/Alexa"" experience. I had really hoped and thought that the Echo Auto would be just like an Echo Input/Dot but use my phone's BT for Internet tethering.No, the Echo Auto is not an Echo device at all. In fact in the Alexa app it is listed separate from the real Echo devices and is grouped together with the Echo Buds as ""on the go accessories"". So what is an Echo Auto? It is a fancy BT mike that talks specifically to your phone's Alexa app. EVERYTHING the Echo Auto does is really being done by the phone's Alexa app, which is now running in background consuming 40+% of the battery (at least on my iphone 6s).",3,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

"It may seem incongruous to rate features ""4"" but overall ""3"", but the discrepancy comes from the inconsistent connectivity the unit exhibits.

The problem could occur because both my wife and I have connections to the device, but once the connection is re-established, things work well for a while until the need to re-connect recurs.  It's great having the functionality when the device works, but the problem needs to be addressed to improve reliability.",3,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
For me the Alexa auto has a lot of problems especially in the bluetooth connectivity.  Initial setup with an iPhone 7 using the latest IOS went fine.  The very next time I tried to connect the Alexa could not make the connection even though the bluetooth screen on the iPhone showed it was connected.  I had to manually disconnect and then reconnect.  This problem seems to happen most of the time and is frustrating.  The voice recognition is OK but not great.  Even with moderate road noise it is just so so.,1,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"The most infuriating Amazon product there it. The concept and novelty wore off mighty quickly when after successfully setting it up I found it easier to use the alexa app on my phone.The worst issue is connection.

"This product relies heavly on the data plan of your cellular plan, so make sure you have unlimited. Otherwise, the product responds in a similar way to the Alexa home devices.

"I'd been waiting for an Alexa for the car. Bought an Echo Tap years ago for that purpose. This device is pretty good. Some improvements needed in software - device can't be renamed - when you have more than one it would be helpful to be able to give it a relevant name. Had trouble getting time and location to work; must fill out all location details, not just ZIP. Once set up to use AUX connection in one car, I had to delete and reset the device to operate with bluetooth in another. Alexa's ability to hear is quite good considering road noise. I wonder if the air vent mount is the best approach; device is small enough there may be a less cluttered way to place it in operation.",4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0

Asked her questions while the music was playing. She dimmed the music volume, answered the question and restored the music.

If it would always stay connected to the network and not have issues connecting to my phone I would give it at least 4 stars, but considering I regularly have to either unplug the device or restart the Alexa app I am only giving it 3 stars.

The call quality is much better than my previous Bluetooth adapter; regardless of where I've placed the Echo in my vehicle the microphones have been able to pick up what I've said.

"I was originally really excited for the echo auto as I have an older car and I wanted to be able to call/text and play music hands-free. After about 20 days of trying to get the echo auto to work it was not worth it. Sometimes she would be amazing, immediately connect to my phone and help play music, search for drive times, etc. The majority of the time she would not be able to connect for the whole drive leaving her useless as I can't trouble shoot or reconnect her while driving. I tried using the aux connection instead of bluetooth and repeatedly changed her settings in the Alexa app. After I set Spotify as my default music service and even if I specially asked for a song from Spotify she would continue to play it from Amazon music. Also for those of you hoping to now be able to take calls hands free it probably won't work. I can hear people's voices through my sound system, but have no microphone for them to hear my responses. The echo auto cannot serve as the mic for you to take calls on. Also dictating sms texts through the echo auto is only for android users.  To be able to text through the echo auto on iOS you can only text through the Alexa app, so the recipient must also have the app. Even after trying to text through the app I wasn't able to get it to work. Long story short I bought a $10 microphone for my car and enabled ""hey Siri"" on my phone and those two things allow me to do everything I was originally hoping to do using the echo auto.

"My impression has definitely gotten better after a lot of digging on the internet to find the fix that is not mentioned in the extremely brief literature provided by Amazon. Speaking only for Android OS phones since that's what I own, you absolutely must change the battery optimization settings to prevent your device from putting the Echo Auto to sleep after any inactivity, such as oh I don't know... PARKING YOUR CAR TO GO TO THE STORE! If you don't disable this setting, when you return with your gallon of milk, you will wish you had bought something stronger because you have to go through the set up sequence all over again from step 1. After nearly throwing it out the window from frustration, I did my own internet sleuthing. I was able to find the fix mentioned above from other previously frustrated owners. Now all is right in the world of Alexa. I just don't understand why this wouldn't be included with the product packaging as part of a Frequently Asked Questions. The only other minor complaint is that it will sometimes lose connection, but that is dependent more on your cell zones and service than the Echo Auto and it will reconnect shortly after. Not a big deal, just wanted to mention it.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"So I bought this device and after using it for a few days i just could not make it work correctly. The problem was that alexa could not locat my music that i asked for from amazon music even though i had an account and was signed into it. Initially i gave this item a 1 star and said it was a piece of crap. So the item sat on my dashboard vent area for 2 months because I could not reach anyone at amazon to talk about this because of some pandemic going on. So like 3 days ago after searching amazon multiple times for a solution to fix the problem. I finally got someone from amazon to call me and they explained the problem within 10 seconds. My amazon music unlimited was only 3.99 a month and only good for 1 device, which was my echo dot at home which i was very happy with... hence the reason I bought the one for my car. I tell you over and over i tried to use that echo auto and not once did alexa suggest that i upgrade my plan to next tier up for 9.99 so i could have up to ten devices instead of just one and that is stupid because i would have upgraded right away.. like 2 months ago.. So of course i upgraded and fixed the problem like In 1 minute. The very next day i got a call about the terrible review that i left. It turns out that they do call everyone back that gives a bad review but right now there are only 7-8 people doing that for every bad review around the country. Needless yo say i kinda let loose on the bs that i had experienced and questioned why I would have hone through all that and why did your product fail to sell me on the upgrade and just leave me hanging out to dry with no answers frustrated. So look up top and you will see that i changed the review from one star to five but that ONLY IS FOR THE PRODUCT I BOUGHT AND THE FUNCTIONALITY ONCE WORKING AS IT SHOULD THAT I AM PLEASED WITH. As far as amazon and their technical department. You need to get it together. The service upgrade i needed and the customer service required to make sure i got it was a FAIL. I don’t care what you got to do but figure it out man, because that’s not my job, it’s yours",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0

"Pleasantly surprised by how well it integrates into my car's system, only a single USB cable and I can place it in a nice place near my car's cup holders. It gets internet from my cell phone without me having to turn on tethering or even WiFi. I'm not using it 100% of the time because I'm used to using my car's controls to change stations but with XM Radio on my phone as well as tons of other audio sources, I should be good to go.I expect it won't work well in rural areas without good data coverage but that doesn't affect me much.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"Awful experience. This device led to battery charging issues and ultimately my alternator going bad in my car. Amazon has always provided good customer service but after telling me they were “investigating this issue”, I have only received 2 phone calls. One asking me how I powered the device (with the included A/C adapter) and a request for me to send my car repair receipt to them. Since I sent the receipt....silence.I asked them if I could return the device so I could have my money back to help pay for the $400 bill. They said no and gave me no. I had to keep it until they told me it was fine to return.",1,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"Until just last week, I loved my Echo Dot Auto! Since then, it has decided to not work two different times and my husband and I had to try to reinstall it. Not good! The music starts for about 8 minutes, then all stop. Both times we reinstalled and now I have given up. Echo keeps saying my cell has been disconnected, but it is not and the bluetooth is still on both my car and my phone. Very frustrating! I really like it when it works! If anyone has ideas, please advise.Thank you. PS I love my home Alexa!",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"This works well, when it works. Unfortunately it disconnects every time the car turns off, it loses connection to the Alexa App (but doesn't seem to lose connection to my phone via Bluetooth).This results in me needing to forget the Bluetooth connection every time I start up the car, then re-add the Echo Auto to my phone via the Alexa app in order to use it.",2,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

This device is great. Hears everything you say and works well. It even comes with a vent dock holder. If you want to make your car a little smarter than get this item. This connects with the Alexa app on your phone and is not a standalone device. Which you may then ask whats the point? Well it doesn’t obstruct your phone screen so you can use it for other things like GPS and the device has dedicated buttons for Alexa. It also routes through your cars speakers for sound and has better listening capabilities than your phone.,4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I really do love my echo auto. I love being able to play whatever song I want at Alexa's command. I love playing games with the echo when driving gets boring. I love just asking questions as to how far do I have to go yet, where is the closest restaurant, where is the closest gas station, etc. The only thing I have had trouble with is this. Sometimes when someone calls me on the phone when I have my echo on I lose the person for a while like I am in a dead zone. I don't know if this is due to my samsung cell phone or due to the echo auto.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I added the Echo Auto to my 2006 Land Rover LR3.  I am very impressed that it can still hear me at 70 mph with my window open and music playing.  The integration with my iPhone is excellent. It uses notifications to start activities like navigation. It's also neat that the integration is two way. Now my iPhone audio comes out of the car speakers via the Echo. Again, this is great. It makes a good bluetooth integration with my old car. It may not be a great upgrade if you already have something like Apple CarPlay but othewise this is an excellent, inexpensive update.",4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I attempted to hook the device up to my truck.  A 2013 Silverado.  I have used Alexa for 3 years now in my home and at my campsite.  Also have it on my phone.  For some reason, it does not want to pair to my vehicle.  Had my son try, and he is a tech guru, but he couldn't do it either.  My grandson tried when he came home from the Army at Christmas, but he could not do it either.  I have not retried since New Years day.  Hopefully someone will come along and fix it at some point in the future.  I can listen to my music from my amazon prime account thru the use of an aux cord to my phone from the truck radio, so that's not really a big deal.  I already have Sirius xm radio in the truck too.  Anyway, I am happy with my other alexa devices in the house.  I got one of the alexa video deals for Christmas, and I haven't hooked that up in the house yet either.",1,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"Received the Echo Auto as a Christmas present.  The USB port in my truck would not power it.  Got a splitter with  USB ports.  Set up was easy  After that the Echo Auto would not reconnect with my phone.  The help section has a number of things to try, one is unplugging the Echo Auto and plugging it in again.  This seems to work OK.  Could be better.  The Echo Auto does give you options such as hands free calling and the overall sound is good.  Update:  Not worth the money  Very hard to reconnect  Great idea poor design.",2,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"While it works, it's great. It allows you to have Alexa around you while you're on the road.Unfortunately, the connection to your phone is very very flaky.

I like this gadget.  I have it playing through my FM transmitter.  Everything worked as expected except the voice recognition.  I still have not set it up.  It keeps giving me an error.  That aside I like being able to play my Sirius channels and Amazon Music all hands free.  One minor thing I do not like is activation the directions feature.  You  actually have to manually acknowledge it on you phone which takes away from the hands free coolness.  I gave it 4 stars would be 4.5 but you can't give half stars.  Good gadget for the price!!!!!!!,4,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"The Eco Auto matched my expectations as far as it goes it did pretty much what was stated, and it should improve as they update it.  The only thing I have a problem with is the air vent mount that comes with it. The rubber that helps guide the power wires had come off the mount, while in shipping, the glue that was on it was tacky but definitely not strong enough to hold. It's not much of a problem I reglued the rubber with a different adhesive and so far it has held up. I was concerned about the rubber that holds the mount to the vent too but it looks to be held on by a revet so it seems okay.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"Connection issues got better the longer I had the echo auto until 2 months ago.  No matter what I did to correct the problem that I thought was with the device nothing worked.  The auto would not connect, I contacted customer service and they gave me a few things to try, nothing worked.  The phone the device is pared with is a samsung s10, recently there was an android update for my phone, after the update the echo auto connects every time.  I suggest don't be to quick to blame the echo auto for connection issues, it might be a case like mine where it was the phone not the auto.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Setup was not easy. And I got mine just over a YEAR of putting my name on the list. I took a flyer when ticket came in and said go for it. Tried setting up inside first with a micro usb. Power is power. No directions. You need to launch the Alexa app on your phone. Then turn on blue tooth.  Then add the device thru the Alexa app and hope it works. Took me a few times. Then you need to keep the Alexa app open ( I think. Doesn’t work if it’s not open) and then honestly, it’s pretty cool. Way better than blue tooth - since I need to handle the phone to change station or make calls if just using a BT receiver. This is pretty damn cool.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Overall, I like the Echo Auto. I really enjoy the hands free aspect of picking music, asking for directions or even just general questions that Echo will answer.  It seems to work well and connects fairly easy.I mounted it to a vent, however, I find myself taking it down each night as it’s something else for people to see and possibly break into your car to get.  This is the only drawback, as I tend to forget to put it back up when I get back in the car.  I just need to find a good place to mount it out of view.",4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"This unit has the same easy install as the Echo and Echo Show.  For me using the ""large letters option"" setting on my phone created some install issues using the app but all it took was making letters smaller so I could see appropriate next steps of install.  My car does not have Bluetooth but the included cable made connecting to car radio EASY.  Although Alexa seems to do everything my ""non-car"" Echos do, one of my biggest uses is listening to SiriusXM in ALL of my vehicles!  Needless to say, the sound is great!",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I really like the build quality of the Echo Auto, and the included vent mount is a good quality as well. Set up was very easy, and talking to Alexa through my bluetooth connection is much easier than trying to use just my phone.  Just like a dot at home, the Echo Auto is always listening.  I did notice that there is a slight delay after you wake her up, but I assume that is the slower connection to the internet through my phone.  And sometimes I will lose the connection all together, but the Echo Auto will reconnect automatically if I unplug it from the lighter and plug it back in.  Great job Amazon you have made another excellent Alexa device that I can't live without.  Music and news in my car will never be the same.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,1,0
This didnt do anything that my phone already didn't do better. Problems included losing connection to my phone inbetween drives requireing me to open the app on my phone to reconnect it. Then it wouldnt connect with my phone at all and i had to delete device and start over again.  Ever time I asked to start my audio book it started it at the wrong spot; i stopped using it and just used my phone. Then today last staw it wouldn't read directions since it lost connection to the Alexa app my passanger restarted the app on my phone for me then i ask for directions confirmed the alexa had the right place and then it was like oh youre a passanger i cant give you directions. So frustrating.,2,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
The Alexa Auto is great. It is the first Alexa device I have purchased and I love it. It seamlessly works with my bluetooth wihin my truck and was super easy to set up. I love the ability to synch it with my Spotify account for music while also being able to use Apps like Tunein for radio stations. I definitely would recommend it.,5,1,2019-10-10,1,1,0
"After I install it following the instructions, it did not work. After contacting their customer service and did some troubleshooting, it sometimes worked but 90% of time it was just a useless black stuff occupying my dashboard.The location of blue light that indicates echo listening is in a very awkward location. I used the car mount that came with the Echo Auto and I was never able to see the blue light because it was facing downward. Therefore, I never knew whether Alexa was listening or not.",1,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"When properly connected via AUX port and iPhone Bluetooth the device has acceptable performance.  On the other hand, removing power seems to require setting up all over again.  Using intuition (and not users manual) discovered using the command ""Alexa, Pause"" before removing power I could use the command ""Alexa Continue"" when power was restored to begin where Amazon music paused.  The sequence is repeatable but it is irritating because modern algorithms should automatically resume Amazon music without operator intervention on iPhone or Android operating system.",3,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"I don't think I need it as much I thought I would in the car. Has many issues. For example, it stops listening to you after you paused for half a second in what you were saying. It is hard to talk to it with a lot of background noise. Also, I was asking it to play a specific song on Spotify, which artist and name I was reading verbatim from Spotify screen, and Alexa still couldn't find it, yet along with more vague search parameters. Also, creates clutter on your dashboard with that bulky mount and cables.",1,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"Terrible. This is the 2nd unit we had as the first one didn’t work. Not really sure what the point of this thing is, it’s slow to respond, you have to have your cars audio on the Bluetooth setting to hear her respond (annoying if you’re listening to anything else), its kind of clunky with wires running around your car, and Alexas functionality is limited and just doesn’t add much here. I personally don’t see the point of this device, and it probably appeals to a very limited segment of individuals.",2,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I have four echo devices in my home. So, I thought, ""why not try it in my car""? Answer, too many cables. Plug Echo into power. Plug the phone into power. Connect the phone into the car's AUX input. the device should connect via Bluetooth. However, not in my car.  I drive a 2014 Chevy Sonic, so all the cables are drooping down the dash board to plug into the power outlet between the seats. I like what it does but I only hook it up for longer drives.  I imagine the echo auto will work well in properly equipped cars.",4,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"This is a pretty cool device, however what is missing is a dedicated driving app similar to Google's 'Android Auto'  app that will activate once your phone is connected to your Echo Auto, that will read in coming text messages, answer phone or place calls, show driving directions, weather conditions, etc. At the moment I have to launch Android Auto, and of course Alexa will not read in coming text messages. Even if they updated the Alexa app to launch when your phone is connected to the Echo Auto, it would still need some modification and updates to have it read text messages, answer and make calls. I understand that you can do some of that by asking Alexa, but it isn't really streamlined, having something that works same way as Android Auto does would be great.",4,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"I got in on the introductory offer and couldn't wait to receive it. When I finally did, I was so happy that I took the chance! It comes with everything you need to include a vent mount and has a very small footprint. Set up was a breeze and I use this every day in my truck for getting directions, getting the weather forecast and even use it for reading books to me through Audible! It is so useful that I don't even realize that it's a fairly new addition to my vehicle. It seems like I have had it forever due to how nice it is! Buy one for every vehicle!",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

"I love having it in my car.  Little wire holder is attached with glue and made to attach to vent.  Well, what happens when you put hot air and glue together?  Yeah, they should have thought that through a bit better.  It keeps falling off and did even before I turned on the heater.  Just the warm air in the car loosened the wire holder.  I also wish there was a way to tell Alexa NOT to connect but it does every time you get in the car.  There should be a disconnect command.  Still love it though.",5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"This is a nice idea for those of us that are familiar with Alexa's talents. I start out asking Alexa if she could hear me once my car is started - most times she would tell me that she lost her connection. Ok, so i have to reconnect her by unlocking my phone. Sometimes that is all that was needed but sometimes i would have to open the Alexa app and tell it that I was a passenger in order to have her listen to me. That's all well and good if you do those things before you take off driving but it is not convenient if you didn't take the time to connect before driving. I have only had one experience where she disconnected when I was driving and it wasn't the time to to fix it so I changed my input.Improvement:  A better, faster connection without having to open an app (particularly when driving)",3,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"My son gave me Alexa Auto 2 weeks ago as a gift. He knew I wouldn't buy it for myself because of the negative reviews. I had read the reviews multiple times and decided it wasn't worth the risk to buy it.  However I am so happy with the product! After the initial setup and restarting my phone once, it has worked perfectly. I waited the 2 weeks before writing a review to be sure problems wouldn't arise.  I have an older car, 2005 Honda Civic. I did have a Kenwood bluetooth player installed last year.  Alexa connects to it perfectly. Spotify, text messaging, calls, and any random questions I ask have worked perfectly as well.  I have had no problems with it disconnecting.  Great product!",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
I live in Sedona AZ where there are areas where the Echo Auto attached to my iPhone drops offline. This was expected because of the iPhone internet signal drops off in these areas. I expect that the Echo will work where cell tower signals are available. The sound quality is excellent.Updated: 7/30/2020: I first used the AUX cable to play the device. I stopped using the device due to what I wrote above. Today I made a change and got a surprising result. I set up the device using Bluetooth and to my surprise the function was amazing. I wasted months thinking the Echo car was limited. Now it plays perfectly.,4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
Overall I like the product but it definitely doesn't function the way I thought it would. I figured that it worked independently from my phone and that I could be doing something on my phone while also using the Amazon Auto but it essentially just uses my phones and Bluetooth in my vehicle to play whatever I'm asking it for. That is disappointing when I am trying to let one of my kids use my phone while driving and I can't ask the Amazon Auto to play music for me because it is playing through my phone and not the auto itself.,4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"The desync issues seem to be a little all over the place, but I have never had to re-run the setup process. My phone has always automatically reconnected to the auto device as soon as I turn on the car. Having voice controlled hands free access to the radio (I use the iHeart app) and music is great, as well as initiating calls. The only very small quibbles I have are sometimes on the highway I have to raise my voice quite a bit to get Alexa to hear me, and the hand-off from going to Wifi to Mobile data is a little awkward sometimes. When pulling away from my house or work and transitioning to mobile data, Alexa will say ""your device has lost connection to the internet"" and I have to tell it to start the radio station or streaming music again. Other than that it works just fine!",4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
I had high hopes for using this for hands free information in my car.  Early on I had inconsistent connectivity.  It would disconnect frequently.The biggest issue I have is it not understanding my requests.  Maybe it struggles with road noise?  I don't know.  I've pretty much given up on doing anything but request music from my Amazon Music library and I only do that on longer drives since I have to change the input on my stereo and drastically adjust the volume.,3,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0

"Loving the product. Just like all devices there are some things to improve upon and skills to be created. One thing I have seen is on the navigation it's not real good with specific addresses. As for the reviewers calling it a ""half baked piece of tech"" I believe these are probably iphone users. As an IT technician for a large college campus I can tell you now that Apple doesnt play well with so many different devices that arent Apple. Amazon can only do so much for that. There are notifications and permissions and settings that have to be set that should not be that hard. I love being able to create the routines so that I can make the outside lights come on as I come down the driveway and so on. I am very excited to watch this device evolve. It does a great job hearing you over windows down and loud music.  I'm taking one start for making the mounting such a hassle. Give everyone a mount that works. Shouldn't have to buy seperate.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I have been using it for a few weeks and really like it. The convenience really is that you can avoid connecting your phone to aux cable and get alexa for voice inputs. There were some bugs initially but they all seem to have been ironed out. If you cannot play Amazon Music consistently, try moving songs to a playlist and then shuffle that. Also, ensure you give the Alexa app all the permission it needs - such as using in the background etc.With the Amazon Music HD, I could feel a noticeable difference in audio quality on my cars JBL speakers. I doubt I can go back to non HD after the trial. This is because Aux cable is used and the device does an excellent job with handling the bluetooth streaming from the phone.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

It’s nice to be able to tell it to play certain songs while driving without having to touch your phone but it rarely ever works.

I only then realized that this was not a typical echo devices, it is not stand alone.  It basically just acts as a Bluetooth extension to use your phone's Alexa app.  I didn't expect this (even though it is in product description).Sound quality is good but occasionally has a bit of a jitter.  I think this may be more of a BT connection issue between my phone and car.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"A good start to the product line, but still lacking a few noticeable features of the rest of the Echo line. For instance, Echo Auto lacks the ability to customize the wake word, so the wake word is not consistent with the rest of my Echo products. And, switching between Bluetooth devices is not as seamless as the other Echo devices. But, with that said, once it is connected to a device, it brings all the benefits of your gone Echo to your car. This was especially valuable to me since I installed it in a vehicle that does not have a Bluetooth enabled system. Thus, the Echo acts as a Bluetooth bridge to my vehicles stereo. With a few improvements, this will be a must-have device for people like me who wanted to add the Bluetooth capability, but was unwilling to pay for a new stereo.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"Very exited to receive the echo auto for many reasons. Ran into issues immediately. Worked with people on the phone to get it hooked up and working for 3 days and figured out things the couldn’t, but short lived. To get it working at all I had to unplug my iPod, set the radio to media, and log in to my phone. Nothing worked as advertised. Tried to send messages which were confirmed but never received. Asked for nearest gas station. Could only get instructions if I gave a specific address. Asked for music and it shuffled until I got home. The only thing that seemed to work was getting jokes and local weather. I returned it on the 4th day I had it. Even the great price wasn’t worth it.",1,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"The only issue I have is there are tims where it just won't connect to my phone. I'd say maybe 5% of the time. I unplug and re-plug it in sometimes help but not always. In those cases I just switch to playing music from something else. The majority of the time when it is working it's great to get the new, play music, get sports scores. It is also great for phone calls, keeping it hands free. And I like the ""announce"" feature so I can let folks at home if I'm stuck in traffic or running late",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
Good product and works exactly like the echo for your home.  It has eight mics all on the top of the unit which get the job done about 6 times out of ten.  Next generation I would look at placing mics in the sides or in direction of the driver and passenger.  This unit is much smaller than I thought it would be.  With vent attachment it is easy to mount and out of the way except for the cord.  It comes out of the side of the unit so potentially in the passengers space or the drivers space.  Works with the Alexa app.  Good for asking directions as it will pull up your maps app.  I also like that I was able to run my Apple Music account through this unit.  It states it can pick up your voice over the air and music but this was struggling with the volume only half way up.  I found myself hitting the button to get alexa’s attention.  Once you say Alexa you have to wait for the music to pause to make your request.  I found myself talking to fast.  Other than that it just had several times she mis heard what I say no matter how slow I say it.  Hopefully next generation will be much better.,3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,1
"It seemed like a great idea. Then it constantly had trouble connecting. It could not decide if it wanted to use Bluetooth or audio jack. It wouldn’t know what song was currently playing. Then i would ask it to play music, and it would say it stopped due to no activity, while music is playing. Since it doesn’t work well in my vehicle, it is in my office or room and gets connected to whatever it feels like that day, and I can listen to some things before it decides there is no activity (while it is actively being used). Disappointed by this particular Amazon product.",2,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
I have been scouring everywhere online to no avail.  I purchased this for my car because I drive a lot and had no convenient hands free option for phone calls.  When I first set this up I was amazed at the capability of being able to just say to have the call connected.  The sound quality was amazing and the people (2) I spoke with in that time said it was a great quality on their end as well.  The only downside I could see was it could not send text messages.Less than a week later there was an update to everything Alexa/Amazon on my phone.  Now text messages work but it also sends a voice clip.  But my calls...while the device connects the call I have no sound in my car.  Nothing has changed except for the updates and I cannot find any information on what may have happened or how to fix the issue.  Everytime I even try to do a search I am inundated with Echo Dot fixes.,3,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

When it would actually connect to my phone (very rare), it had no problem making calls but would not hang them up, no matter how many times and different ways I tried to tell Alexa. However, most of the time the device would not work at all. If I had a dollar for every time I had to listen to Alexa say ""I'm sorry, your echo auto is unable to connect to your Alexa app..."" I could retire. When I would go to the Alexa app, it would show that everything was connected as it should be. The only way to get it to actually connect and work was to unplug it and redo the entire set up. After the setup is redone, I  would leave my car with my phone, even for just a minute, and it would have trouble reconnecting again. I would again have to do the whole setup to make it work (even though my phone and the app shows they are still connected). When I first got the device I thought it would get better as I used it more and figured out its quirks. Well, there are no quirks. It just is plain awful and a waste of money. Unfortunately for me, I missed the return window by a week all while getting annoyed and frustrated by the thing daily, and now I can't even get my money back. I guess it's what I deserve for not knowing better and thinking it would work any better than my echo dot which annoys me as well. I think I'm going to switch to Google home and other Google products that I hear are much better. The Bluetooth adapter that I was trying to replace suddenly doesn't feel so bad any more. Glad I kept it. I'm going to give this echo auto to someone I don't like.",1,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0

"I love the Echo Auto.  It's so convenient for what I use it for, which is grocery lists, reminders, shopping lists, sending voice messages, playing my play list.  It's great when it works - it often loses connection.  Sometimes it will send the message and sometimes the person never receives it even though Alexa said she sent it.  Sometimes it will read my messages to me; sometimes it won't.  The volume has to be turned up to max to hear Echo Auto.  When playing my music, I have to turn the radio up real high to even hear it.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"Alexa is amazing! And now that I can have her in my car, hands free from using my phone app, I’m so happy! Asking weather, adding to my shopping list, asking for a reminder, etc. I’m on the go, a lot! So this just really helped me out having access to her in my car. You can call people thru her but it’s a bit more echo sounding than using the capability through my car device. Playing music is easier than when I was using the audio through just the regular app as well. We are so happy with this device !",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"Echo auto was easy to set up and connects to my car’s Bluetooth more quickly than my phone! You wouldn’t think you could use one more gadget but since I use Alexa in the house, it is synced with my Echo auto and I can easily add things to my list, play music, and podcasts just from speaking to my Echo. My phone could do that but asks me to unlock it each time and the whole point is to keep my attention on the road, so Echo is perfect for that since it takes voice commands with no necessity to unlock every time.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"I love Amazon Echo and have 4 of them in my home and got so excited when I heard about Echo auto. However, it sucks. Just to get it set up I was on the phone with customer support for an hour, and now it constantly loses connection to my phone while I am in the middle of driving so it becomes useless. Also never understands me unlike other Echo devices, and seems to be way slower.",2,1,2020-2-25,1,1,0
"Reading the other reviews, it's obvious, this isn't a magic solution for every person. However, I love this device. It is easy to set up and convenient to use. Both my vehicles have a 3.5 Aux Input, so Echo Auto means that I no longer have to fumble with plugging/unplugging my phone, I can keep it in my pocket. It syncs up well with my phone (LG Q7+). I can interact with Alexa just like I do at home (love turning lights on in the house). Also very portable - I can easily switch cars and bring it with me. A couple drawbacks would be (1) the mount is limited in its versatility. Compatible with just certain air vent types. And (2) depending on road noise - I sometimes have to lean in close to wake Alexa.  Overall a fun convenient addition to my vehicles.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I like the Echo family of products a lot and own 5 at home. When I saw a TV commercial for the Auto model I ordered one immediately. While the device looks great it requires permanent connection to a USB port for power. My vehicle (2019 VW Jetta) has a single port and I use a 3-inch cable to neatly connect my iPhone and use for Apple CarPlay functionality.I am not a fan of long ugly USB cables and while I know I could use a 2-way USB adaptor, it would mean the Echo cable would be in my line of sight at all times. I packed it up and returned it immediately because this was a non-negotiable for me.",2,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

Don’t Use it with straight talk phone service plan.  Tried it out for two hours and got a warning from them about service terms violation.  My vehicle doesn’t have Bluetooth audio and aux in sounds like garbage.  I had some trouble with Alexa understanding me and noticed a lag with requests and actions.  But didn’t try it again after the first day because straight talk threaten to cancel my plan.  Ended up just buying a aux in Bluetooth adapter and streaming Alexa from the app.  Bluetooth adapter is soooo worth it for OEM radios without BT.,1,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"I purchased this item as a test model through Amazon.  First and foremost, the app for this device is horrible.

"We were so excited to use the Auto Echo for a recent Christmas road trip!  We tried to use it for almost an hour and a half until we gave up. I’m just glad we got it on Cyber Monday. If I’d have paid full price, I’d be really upset.It just doesn’t work. It gets hung up, glitches and stops in the middle of things. I think it hears too well with the multiple microphones. Someone could fart in the backseat and it will interrupt whatever you had going. At other times I felt I had to yell into it.  Playing Trivial Pursuit I was just screaming answers at it and it would just stop or start playing a random playlist.",1,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Upsides -I have a 2010 Honda CR-V with no bluetooth so Alexa is definitely a great addition.  Navigation is much easier than accessing Google maps directly on my Android phone.  Music quality is much better than FM, even though the same speakers are used.Downsides - when leaving home the switch from home wifi to 4G sometimes causes a break in communication, & need to power cycle the Echo.  When phone signal strength is not optimal, Alexa sometimes takes a very long time to respond.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I was very excited to have an Alexa device for my car. Like others, I didn't quite understand why it needed cords with today's technology but ... whatever. At first, it worked well. I used it for managing my shopping and ""To Do"" lists, and music. Tried to ask for directions but always got the same answer: ""I'm not sure."" No matter what questions I asked, except for weather forecasting, always got ""Im not sure."" C'mon Amazon, we all know you can do better than this!! After having used this device for 6 months, I  unplugged it. Why? Because when I ask for my music it quit responding. It quit responding to everything I ask of it!! Don't waste your money... LOVE the concept, but it doesn't work like the indoor devices. VERY disappointing! Amazon should be paying US $25 to test it.",2,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
It actually works quite well execution wise. Getting directions via echo you have to tap a notification on iPhone which is a bit annoying but probably related to the api. The big piece was amazon music integration which works quite well. The reason why I won’t be using it regularly is the data consumption. It is a hog and used 1 gb of data in a week for what normally is 100 mb maybe using music and navigation independently. I don’t have an unlimited data and plan and won’t be using it regularly because of this.,3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Will not automatically connect to my phone when I get in the car. Often disconnects if I ever actually get it to connect. Says trying to connect when I say, ""Alexa,"" but it doesn't ever connect. Buggy, useless waste of money. This is what I get for jumping on the bandwagon at 1.0. This is not ready for public release. It is a hopelessly alpha stage product, in need of sufficient additional testing at the user level. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT YET! I HOPE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS, AMAZON!",1,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I don't know if I got a lemon or all units are bad.  The unit is not very responsive.  It works around half the time.I called tech support around a half dozen times.

we were miss informed about echo auto we wasted a lot of time on the phone with amazon as to when we would get it  when we did get it we could not install it because we had no smart phone to connect to echo aps even tho we have a hot spot and blue tooth in our car my daughter came down with her smart phone and installed it it did work but the connecting cables were all over the car once she left it would not work gave it to my daughter and she could not use it because it interfered with her blue tooth connections,1,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0

"We were so excited to get our Echo for the car. My 3 year old is obsessed with our Echo in the house. I have an older car, that required both wires to be plugged in (the power one and the one that plugs into the speaker). It was very difficult to set up, and after it was set up it didn't always work. She was constantly ""having trouble connecting to the network"". It could be because we have poor cell service around our house, but it wasn't worth the $50 to keep it. I REALLY wanted it to work for us, but I returned it. I will just use the Amazon Music app and plug my iPhone into the hear phone jack in the car.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
Doesn't work well with an iphone.  I first started using this echo with an iphone 6S Plus and I thought it was just my iphone was too old for the bluetooth to work properly.  I upgraded to an iphone 11pro max and I'm having the same issue.  Echo sometimes play on the iphone speaker and sometimes on the car speakers.  I have to open the iphone control center and it switches to the car speaker.  Microphone works half of the time.

One of two things will happen, either after a couple of seconds of pause, the book will resume and all is well, or the bluetooth in my phone will turn off and the easiest way to reconnect everything is to turn off the car, turn on bluetooth on my phone, then start the car.

I can even have her text, make phone calls and open other apps if I want her to.

I could go on and on.I have read some of the negative reviews and I can say that my phone has issues with Bluetooth to the car before I started using this device. I can call with no problems. Set up was easy and I have an old Google Pixel.  The only problem I had with connectivity had nothing to do with the Echo, it was my wifi trying to take over my data.

This may be my most disappointing Amazon purchase this year.  The Echo Auto is very unreliable.  Sometimes I have to stop it and start it several times to get it to play without skipping.

"I got the invite only echo auto for half the price. When I connected it to my car's AUX, everything worked fine. When I restart the car though, I had to go through the setup process all over again, which defeats the purpose of this device. Amazon support is not helpful or they don't understand the problem.

Adding Alexa Siri wasn’t difficult it was simple after you realized its listing under the Amazon Echo you may have to update your app also.  Using  Amazon Auto is simple and in my opinion it’s just like using Siri or Google.  I feel that the Auto is perfect for vehicles that don’t have a Bluetooth connection because if you have one then you can simply use your phone to do the same things that the auto can do.

"UPDATING to say Amazon called and talked me through it. Seems to be working now.  User error on my end.  It is great, the only thing that would make it better is if Alexa recognized speech while you had the regular radio playing. You need to stay in bluetooth mode to use it (ie - at home you had have your TV on and say alexa and she will respond from the dot - having that capability while the radio playing would make this product phenomenal! )Ugh I am SO disappointed! Unfortunately, it does not work in my 2016 Chevrolet Traverse. It does not pick up no bluetooth. Alexa does not respond unless I am using the app from my phone (so it only gets used when I have a passenger in the car with me). Once it does play, sound is great, since it comes through the car speakers.  But definitely not what I expected when I purchased it.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0

It took so long for the transfer I kept having calls go to my voicemail before I could answer them. I had to remove it and give it to my kid.

I really find myself depending on it when I'm out and about. I find it more responsive than OK Google, while driving, I'm assuming that the mics work better than those on my phone.

Other then having to set it up once in a while this is a great product and we are happy we purchased this product.

It's easy in retrospect, but for some reason I didn't realize that I needed to have the Alexa App open *all the time* in the car, not just when I make the initial connection between my car and Alexa.

I have a new iPhone, and there’s times Alexa will say she’s having trouble connecting to the network. I’m not sure if it’s having issues with my phone, or it’s the network itself.

It's a cool concept however it is only an extension of what your cell phone could do with the alexa app. I am not happy with how the alexa app works and by proxy I do not enjoy the echo car adapter. It's a neat idea but not worth the price at all. Maybe if the app gets better this item will also get better. I had no issues connecting it to my phone or the Bluetooth radio in my equinox.

"Having an Alexa device in my car is pretty awesome. It allows me to change music, play games, make calls, and ask for directions all hands-free. It didn’t get 5 stars for a couple different reasons. First, sometimes when I say Alexa, it will recognize my voice but not my command and it will just shut off. This usually results in me having to restart the entire device. Second, there are many times when it cannot connect to my device despite my phone having full service and the app being open. Again, this results in me having to restart the entire device.

It would be really nice to combine multiple accounts too, I have an Audible account but the Amazon music is on my husbands account. We have the same issue with the home Echo, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. With Android Auto being offered in so many new cars, I don't know if this is a sustainable gimmick.

What I don't like and find to be a real deal breaker is that I have to have bluetooth selected as the audio for it to work.  I cannot be listening to the regular radio and then hear a response from the Echo device.  I can still issue instructions like, add something to a list but the only way to fully interact is to be on the bluetooth input which means you can't use the regular radio.  Of course you can play music through the Echo instead of the radio but that means you are burning data on your phone.  Even though I have unlimited data I believe it throttles down the speed after some point so  that's a consideration.  This may be a limited of my car.  I'm not sure.  I can access my phone through the car speakers so calls are handsfree but anything else, I have to use a different input.  I have a 2013 Honda Accord.",3,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0

"Look, 5his is a nice solid and functional piece of tech. pairs up with my deck very well and is responsive to each command. Does well with ROAD NOISE, not so great with road noise AND the tunes cranked Up. This is a user malfunction and not the echo auto.

"I already have a SYNC system in my car, but can't access things like iHeart Radio, my amazon music, etc., unless I pull over and open up the individual app on my phone. The Echo Auto has changed all that! I really love the convenience of asking for what I need. Another thing I noticed, is the sound quality is much better. It fit just fine in one of my vents, but didn't care for the cumbersome long cord, so it rests across my cup-holder which is near the console where it's discreetly plugged in. I have read other reviews stating you have to log into your Echo app on the phone before it works, I have to do that too, and it is annoying. Wish it was automatic upon entering the car.All and all - I am glad I purchased the Echo Auto!",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"Outside of an issue of not being able to stop directions somewhere unless through your phone, the biggest flaw is how much battery this things drains from your phone. I'm talking, morning commute of less than 15 mins and I asked it 1 question, it took my battery from fully charged to 40% by the time I get to work. HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN? It really makes me not trust the Alexa app. Which this thing requires to be up and running to even work. I would love to just keep the app running but uh, no. Not happening with drainage like that. So barely use the thing now. Not a good purchase.",2,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

This makes no sense to me.  I am super disappointed.  I was expecting this device to be in my car at the ready.  I should be able to talk and tell it to play songs, turn down the A/C on the way home and add things to my to do list...  Instead I have to open the app on my phone, change the mode on my radio, so it can play through the speakers of the car... This is so pointless.

This product is almost useless.  I am only writing this review because I saw amazon is now advertising it on TV and no one should buy this.  The only actual use for this product is to say “alexa turn on my lights and set temperature to 72.”...which u can just do with your phone.  Used for 2 weeks and threw it in a drawer never to be used again.  This product would be useful with apple integration but is 97.9% useless otherwise.

"I have 6 echo’s of some sort in my house, so I’m used to using them a decent amount.  I honestly haven’t used the echo auto as often as I was expecting. It works just like the ones at home, except it’s routing the audio through Bluetooth and your phone to go through the car’s audio system. It uses an internet connection from your phone. I’ve used it for the basics like weather and opening a Pandora playlist, which is handy and a much safer way to access music while driving.  Id say it’s a neat device that does enable you to drive more easily hands free, but it’s also something I could live without as well.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0

I'm able to do everything from listen to music, podcasts, weather & my local radio stations while seamlessly change in between stations all hands free! THE ONLY reason I did not give it 5 stars is the power cord seems a bit long so it hangs with excess cord-not a HUGE issue more of a personal preference for aesthetics. I'm sure I could find a way to wrap the cord & secure it so less hangs. All in all SO GLAD I have this in my car & I also REALLY LOVE how the air vent mount doesn't block the vent!! It sits up above the vent while locking into the top so plenty of air still flows :)",4,1,2019-10-22,1,0,1
I was so excited to order this and so disappointed with the result once it came.  Its a great concept and the list does not say it is not compatible with my car (2018 Honda Odyssey) but it has significant problems.  I think there are issues with how Android Auto or Apple Play conflicts (although I am not turning those on at the same time).  Weird error messages come from the Echo and interrupt all the time.

It just wouldn't connect very well with any of our phones.  The car it was in has Bluetooth and our phones connect just great every time we get in the car.  The Echo Auto would just keep trying to connect.  Even when it would connect, it would take forever for it to respond.  Also, it would pick horrible times to connect, such as when I am in a conversation on my phone it would randomly connect to my phone and mess up my call.

First I’m a home amazon echo fan. So not a knock on Home Amazon echo. Just this automobile product is not ready for prime time. Seems like a pre-release that may work better sometime in the future. It just seems to have a difficult time connecting on a regular bases. I would say it is about a 50/50 shot every time you get into your vehicle. I find myself saying Alexa are you there regularly? At the end of their day I would not make this purchase going forward until possibly the next release where Amazon works out the re-connection issues.,2,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0

Then it would ask if I want to navigate right now.  Drives me nuts.  Otherwise, when it is working properly, yes it is like having Alexa with you along for the ride.  P.S. I also have mine set up to open/close garage door via my voice command.  Overall - it is worth it when it is on sale.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0

The echo auto is a good product but has issues with Bluetooth on android phones.  At times the Bluetooth will cut out and you will need to power down & power up the echo to recalibrate.  I have an Amazon music account I am able to access on phone to listen to but not able to access with the echo auto (annoying).  The sound quality is very good ( just remember it is Bluetooth volume controlled).  When thes quirks get worked out it will be a rival to Sirius Xm subscriptions but until than I can only provide 4 stars on overall performance.,4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

I went to work, left work and all I had to do was click in my Alexa app that i was a passenger.  It fired right up. The wire is not an issue, I just simply tucked it around out of the way. So far so good! My only complaint is it is so quiet. So I have to remember to turn it up all the way on my cell.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
The Echo Auto connected and setup quite easily. Using Bluetooth to play music worked well. My big issue with the device is Alexa. The voice assistant was unable to locate specific stores for me hands free and I would have to use the built in Google assistant in my phone to get good search results for things close to me. Alexa couldn't find close by gas stations or give me hours for a store that I wanted to visit.Alexa also had trouble finding specific playlists on Tidal that I wanted to listen to even with the Tidal skill activated and I would have to manually select the music I wanted to listen to.,3,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"My 9 year and I now can use Alexa in the car to answer our many questions.  We connected it up as soon as we got it, right away we found songs we wanted to listen to with just our voice. We did not have to push any buttons to call anyone. And for those mysteries that come up while driving a 9 year old to school, we had answers without having to get my phone out.  I did try to set reminders or add to lists, but it did not let me do that. It said it was coming soon.  I  hope it is added soon.  The sound is very low so I have to turn it up very high, which if turn on the radio it is blaring.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like this device. I LOVE all of my household Echos, but the Echo Auto fell short for me. I was optimistically skeptical when I read the reviews about connectivity problems, but have since come to realize that those reviews are warranted. I liked the idea of having a hands-free option in the car, especially one with better control over music in a non-iTunes environment. Since I use Spotify, Siri always has problems searching for and playing music in that app, but Alexa doesn't. With the constant connectivity problems found in the Echo Auto, it often was more of a hassle than anything.Most of the time, my Echo Auto wouldn't connect to my phone for 5-10 minutes into my drive, even when I manually selected the Bluetooth device. I also often faced the frustration of my phone randomly connecting to the Auto when I wasn't even in the car. The car would be in the garage, and I would be in the kitchen, or my car would be in a parking lot, and me in the grocery store, and my phone would try to connect to the Auto, booting me off of other Bluetooth devices.",2,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Took forever to connect. First, it wouldn't work with my Bluetooth. So, I tried to bypass Bluetooth and just use the included cable. The instructions said to plug one end into my radio. Excuse me? I could not for the life of me find anywhere to plug anything into my radio. So back to Bluetooth. I finally got it to work. First thing I tried was getting directions. Nothing. Useless. I could get the time and the weather, but my car tells me that stuff already. I finally gave up and just used my phone and Google.

"I love my Amazon Echo, so I was really excited when my new Echo Auto showed up on my door step.  But, what a disappointment .  It is hard to believe that Amazon would release something so clumsy.  It does not work reliably the way it is designed to but even if it did, I would not be satisfied.  In order for the thing to work your car radio has to be set on blue tooth or AUX.  So you can't just be driving down the road listening to your radio and then ask Alexa to do something.  You would have to change the radio mode first.  What is the point of a voice activated assistant if you have to push buttons on the car radio first?The only way Alexa is going to be a good mobile assistant is if Apple would ever just allow us to replace Siri with Alexa on its phones. Unfortunately that will probably never happen because apple thinks they are way better than they are.  The bottom line, I will, sadly, probably return my Echo Auto, but if Amazon ever comes up with a cell phone.  I would consider buying it.",2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0

My entire home is set up as a smart home, we have Alexas in every room, and I was hoping to be able to add the convenience of the Echo to my car as well.  Clearly there are a lot of issues to work out.  I was excited when I got the opportunity to try it out, but it’s gonna be a long time before I use anything outside of the home again.

Used it to add phone call support to an old car. Connectivity was easy and clarity of calls and music excellent. Occasionally i would get complaints of an echo sensation when people would call me.

My in car hands-free system was TERRIBLE, so that was a side bonus.But the other thing that really makes it perfect for me is that I can take it out of the car.

"The product works fine in a 1-user, 1-car scenario. When more people drive the same car, only 1 drivers can have the phone connected leaving other drivers without Alexa. My wife and I both drive our car. When we’re together I tend to drive. I would not think this is a-typical. Unfortunately Alexa Auto can only connect to 1 phone which means that when my wife is driving the car by herself, she can’t use Alexa. She can only use it when we’re both in the car, and I can use when I’m alone in the car. This makes this product insufficient and makes me look for alternatives. If I find a product that would work, I will throw out the echo auto.The voice recognition is pretty good. It’s not as snappy, because you have to wait for the connection, but you get used to that. I have mine mounted on it’s side against the center console. It’s effectively hidden but still very functional from a voice response perspective. I don’t think mounting it on the vent - as I got the vent mount would have been any better.

"After almost a year on the waitlist, I finally got the opportunity to purchase the Echo Auto. I have six Echo and/or Alexa-enabled devices in my house that I use (and love) on a daily basis and was hoping to carry this function to my car. Sadly, this product is a huge disappointment. I mainly wanted this to play music services Amazon Music and SiriusXM and to complete basic tasks like adding things to a shopping /to do list, setting reminders, etc. The device hears me fine, it just doesn’t deliver. I’ll ask it to shuffle a playlist of mine, it will say “now shuffling XYZ playlist” and then won’t play a song. Or it will play the first song and then stop before playing a second song. Sometimes on the third request, it will shuffle my playlist, but I don’t dare ask it to skip a song. Doing so, stops the music 95% of the time and I’ll have to start the process all over. The Amazon Music app on my iPhone works flawlessly – you just have to leave it open on the screen. The main reason I wanted the Echo Auto was to have Waze displayed on my phone screen and not the Amazon Music app. Its mind boggling that the Echo Auto is so bad when all other Alexa devices are own are really good. This functions like it’s the first voice activated device created, not an extension of an already successful product. I got this for the intro price of $25 (including a mount). It’s so bad, that I tried to return it. It’s not even worth $25. Unfortunately, I missed the 30-day return window by a day, so I’m stuck with this thing.

If you step out of the car for gas, food, etc and back in, sometimes you have to re-establish Bluetooth or App connection. Also, no other device can be streaming Amazon music under your account.

Once the system recognizes the connection it works nicely with Pandora, Spotify, etc.  It still can't tell me weather b/c it claims not to know my home address - even though that information is loaded into Alexa's database.

So you can’t just start asking The Echo Auto anything until you change from your radio station, or whatever, to connect to your phone. Even after connecting if I ask Alexa to send a text to my wife it won’t send a text to her messages app on her iPhone but rather sends the message to her Alexa app which she’ll never see. Or I ask Alexa to call her and instead of a normal call it used Alexa app to make the call.  In other words we were talking over the internet instead of the phone which sounded horrible. My car already has a Bluetooth phone feature so adding the Echo auto did nothing for me. It’s actually easier to use the phone to bring up podcasts etc than the Echo Auto.",2,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"No problem setting it up. Plays music while I travel but will not read books that I have on my fire. Biggest gripe is when you get a phone call (phones are used for phone calls all the time), you reaction is to turn down the music and answer the phone. But the voice of the person that you're talking to is transmitting blue tooth to your radio speaker which you've already turned down so you could answer the phone. Either they hang up or you do but the call is lost. Half baked idea looking for $50 from you.",2,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"It says to mount the device on your dash and because of extreme heat I was reluctant to do so and being that my USB port is inside my armrest I tried 2 play sit in the arm rest with a USB port so there's no wires and to my surprise it picks my voice up very well even over music and the armrest is closed. I love the fact that I can take my device on the go set reminders, add calendar events, turn my lights and fans on and off, get directions, find out the weather all without having to take my hands off the wheel or grab my phone out.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,1,0
"Received as a gift but it didn’t see a need for it . My phone connects to android auto and I’m able to use the “hey google “ command to access the gps for directions  , contacts, music and everything else hands free so I don’t need this echo auto device .If your car comes with android auto or CarPlay compatible radio head units you don’t really need this . Still have it 5 stars because it could be useful for older vehicles without the latest onboard entertainment systems .",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
This product is terrible. I love Alexa and Amazon products but Jesus. I wish I hadn't spent the money. Does not integrate well with car and phone. I spend at least 12 min trying to get this to connect to my phone to even play music while im driving. It's terrible. I am just going to put this in a box and forget about it. Don't BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY. the worst thing you can buy,1,1,2020-3-3,1,1,0
"My winter beater doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity, so I use this with an FM transmitter and it still works just fine.  My only gripe is that I have to open the Alexa app on my phone to get the phone and Echo Auto to connect just about every time I get in my car.  It's a minor annoyance, though, and well worth the $50 to have access to all of Alexa's features while I'm on the road (my best thinking time).  My favorite is adding items to my shopping list on my way to the store.",4,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"You’re better off buying a phone clip/magnet and using the Alexa app. It needs to connect every time you turn on the car and this is a tedious process. Not sure what I thought buying this, since I really only used it to choose songs on Spotify and that didn’t even work most of the time. I asked it for directions to the nearest Best Buy as a test and it told me the nearest one was 60 miles away, 54 minutes with traffic 55 minutes with no traffic (yes it told me it was faster with traffic and there are 3 Best Buys within 10 miles).",1,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I was very excited to receive the email that my opportunity to buy the Echo Auto was finally here!  I've been mostly satisfied with it, but there have been more frustrations that I would have expected, after enjoying the two Echos I already have in my home.  For example:- You cannot change the wake word, like you can with the Echos at home.  Seriously...what is the point of having a voice-activated computer aboard if I can't address it as ""Computer"" a la Star Trek???",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"My girlfriend and I both received one of these at a discounted price before they were available to the public...  our first impressions for the first week were bleak because the unit kept losing connectivity between the phone and the device.  After about a week or so I think there was an update that seemed to fix the problem for the most part.  As far as using this device it works pretty well, It can be quirky at times and there is a little bit of a delay before a response but for the most part it’s just like having a Amazon echo inside of your car.  I enjoy using it to make phone calls in the car is nice.  I only paid $25 for it I don’t think I would pay full price just yet but for  $25 it was worth it.",3,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I have a 10 year old car Alexa did not want to work in my car.  I received a call from Kyle in Amazon Customer Support and we not only got my grumpy car to accept Alexa but also my cell phone.  I suspect that most of my problem was operator issues.  I am so happy that Kyle called and we worked together to get the problems taken care of.  Without the wonderful customer support I would have been a grumpy customer, I am however, thrilled with your company, the product and most of all for your wonderful customer support.

"Just a glorified microphone work a mute button. Everything is still through the phone to the car, just now there's a second (or third) microphone in the car.

"When I learned of this device, I was very excited, I just had to get onto the wait list and get notified when it was available. Then finally, the day came! Instantly I ordered one. She arrived, Alexa in my car! (I drive a 2013 Impala, btw) Get her set up in minutes, she could hear me just fine through the music, no more plugging my phone into the aux port, I was delighted!However, there are some drawbacks. Obviously, connectivity issues are going to be prevalent, but that is to be expected, however I do often have to reset the device whenever I begin a new trip, but after it reconnects to my phone it's usually good to go. Sometimes it takes a bit longer, I have to restart the phone, and rarely, go through the set up process once more! Yes, these issues are annoying, but when I get Alexa working she does her job as I expect her to.",4,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"Overall it works just like the Alexa at home but you have to have your car audio set to a certain mode.  While in the Alexa mode, you cannot listen to your radio, you can only listen to Alexa....I was hoping it would be on in the background and if you wanted to ask it a question, you would do like at home...wake with Alexa then ask away.  To some people that may not matter but if you have unlimited data it matters.  Still like it though, just don’t use it as much as I would if it was integrated better.",4,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I have multiple echo devices in my home and wanted an option to stream music and make phone calls from my car. This seemed to be a great addition. That's why I purchased this.

Can do basically anything you can do from any other echo device.",3,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

"Small slim design, easy to mount into the car. Initial set-up was a bit frustrating, but works fine afterwards. Integrates with CarPlay in my Rouge without issues. Voice recognition is for the most part accurate,if my son is talking in the back seat it can distract the unit from hearing me clearly and play some random song or the typical Alexa response of I don't understand...Overall though it was worth the purchase. I use it every single day so . We sometimes will ask questions on road trips to learn about thing and places we see. Long trip coming up so we may be using audible.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"This is a great device. Impressive design and well built. It's small size makes it easy to put about anywhere. The only design change I would suggest would be some way to run the power out of the back of the unit. I don't know if a small pivot could be installed on the corner to allow side or rear plug in changes. When trying to place the device and make the install look clean, having the plug come out the back could be a benefit. That's being nit-picky because it's a great device.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"So far my experience is kind of mixed around echo auto. Here are my points:1. Connectivity between the device and my phone: from time to time it does disconnect from my phone for brief seconds and then quickly picks the connection back, but happens.",3,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"Ok first off, this relies on the Alexa app you have on your phone device, if your device is connected via Bluetooth or is cabled to the stereo system of your vehicle, I don't see the need for this device. I was expecting more of a stand-alone product, connected via hotspot to your phone to get internet connectivity & away you go. This is more of a glorified adapter for your phone/stereo where your phone can equally function as it is. No need for another device to relay the information out.",1,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0

"I live in the mountains and typically have to travel 20 minutes towards town in order for my phone signal to be strong enough for the Echo Auto to work. I figured this would be the case, but I was determined to be an early user of the device. A nearby friend of mine has one and he raves about his device. He drives a lot for work and says it made his stupid car smart. He uses maps, music, and I don't know what else.

"This was a Christmas gift for my wife.  She really likes it.  She uses it everyday to listen to her music and/or meditations in the car.  This device thru the aux port has given my wife's cell phone handfree bluetooth capability for phone calls also.  This not being a feature in the car made the device even more useful.  I've been in the car several times and I too have enjoyed using it along with Amazon music. I haven't given it 5 stars only because I myself experienced difficulty trying to sync my phone to it after unpairing the other. Then, again connecting the original phone seemed to take longer than expected.  However, if we had left the device as it was there would be no issue.  A dash mount option would be nice bc not all vent mounts are vertical.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"After reading reviews about Echo Auto that talk about non-functionality, I wonder if the setup was not done correctly by the folks who are having problems with it.  I have pushed this little thing to limits that I thought would not allow it to function, such as with the car windows open in noisy environments, and it always works.  The only time it does not work is when it cannot get a network connection.  And that has to do with crappy cell coverage in certain areas.  I have been enjoying the Echo Auto as a hub for information and for music.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I was so, so excited when I saw this was coming out and purchased mine on invitation for $25. I wanted to love this but this might be the glitchiest item I’ve ever owned. I will say that setup was super easy, it’s just getting the device to stay connected and be useful that’s the issue. It spends quite a while trying to connect to my phone and most of the time, fails. I almost always have to abandon using the device and found out a friend does the same, which means it’s likely not user error.  When it does work (which is roughly 15% of the time), it’s great. I hope they work the bugs out because this has great potential.",1,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0

Within a week of using this device, I found myself having to reconnect to my phone when attempting to use.  Now it won't even connect to my phone (using both prescribed methods).The ONLY good thing about this device is that I got it for free from my insurance company.  I guess they figured I'd be a more safe driver with it.  I would disagree as it eventually becomes a distraction as one attempts to restore communication between it and their phone.",1,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0

"My current setup: I have a Mini Cooper with Bluetooth phone support but only aux in for media. I plugged the echo auto into the aux in and powered it up. Connecting went really quickly. I decided not to put it on my dashboard since I didn't want to have to pull it down every time I parked so I put in the cubby in front of the gear shift.  I asked Alexa to shuffle my playlist - worked as expected.  Asked her to navigate to a business (like navigate to the petsmart in [my town]). She confirmed the street and my phone went right into Google maps and started navigating to petsmart. I still wanted to use my car's bluetooth for calls because I have the steering controls and displays. When I made or recieved a call, it went through the car's phone bluetooth and my displays and steering wheel controls worked. Even when I made the call via alexa, it went through my car's bluetooth. Out on the road, at 60mph with the windows down and sunroof open, she heard my commands without having to raise my voice, even though it's mounted in the cubby. Actually, maybe that's better because it's shielded from the wind.So far, I've been very impressed! The only problem I've encountered is sometimes pulling away from my house there is a connection delay when my phone switches from wifi to mobile but that's not the echo auto's fault.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"I wanted to love this so much! We've been saying for years that Alexa was needed in car. Unfortunately, this device just never seems to work. I have to reconnect it constantly. And that process is super lengthy and time consuming so I'm usually sitting in my garage to try to get it to connect or at every stoplight trying to complete the steps. It says it will play a song, but the song never comes on. Navigation is a joke. The whole point is to be hands free but it tells you to allow the navigation pop up on your device first. There are so many glitches to work out. The only reason I gave this two stars is because when it does work to play a song we are searching for, I can be hands-free! Just wish it worked consistently.",2,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

She says that she ""lost connection with your phone"" and won't reconnect. unplugging and plugging back in is the only way it seems to reconnect. Otherwise, it plays quite well.

Have four Echo devices in my home and they have created so many conveniences via voice commands to perform skills!

It automatically connects when we get in the car (was previously set up with bluetooth). 98% of the time it hears me perfectly. I’m not sure if it was fair to knock off an entire star for voice recognition, but it does get buggy sometimes. I play games (mostly song recognition) sometimes. It does not always “hear” what I am saying.I definitely recommend this product even though it’s not always perfect. It’s pretty close!",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Overall the Echo Auto does what it is designed to do.  I can now ask for music on Amazon music, make phone calls and open my garage door all by voice without taking my eyes off the road or hands off the wheel.  I can also turn on lights and the heat in my house before I arrive.  The negatives are that sometimes the device doesn't immediately connect with my iPhone.  Also, the installation looks a little messy since the power cord must run from the device to the USB or power outlet.  Finally, while the mics generally work quite well, under high road noise conditions they sometimes have difficulty understanding your commands.  Overall though, if you're into the Amazon/Alexa world, I would recommend it as a device worth having.",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"The unit is smaller and lighter than I expected.  It was easy to place on the vent adapter and it fit easily on the vent. I had a difficult time pairing the Echo to the Alexa app and wound up having to contact Amazon for assistance.  Once it properly paired I was able to use my Alexa commands just like on my Echos in the house.  I took a trip across several states the day after I got the unit and I have mixed feelings about its performance.  It literally depends on your phone connectivity to make the Echo auto functional.  There were long stretches on the Interstates where I had no phone service so no Alexa.  The sound quality depends on your cars sound system so I was very pleased as I have a decent system in my car.  When Alexa was working, the response was great to my commands just like my home echos and the speakers picked up my commands over the music and air conditioning.  The small cord manager on the vent adapter fell off when the car was hot but I was able to get it back on.  It is very useful. I would like to see micro-suction cups on the bottom of the unit so it would sit on the dash.  Overall I am pleased with the unit and I am enjoying it",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

If I use the iPhone alone I can stop the truck and go in the store and when I return the phone \ truck starts my sirus xm programing where I left off. Alexa just gets confused.

"I can honestly say I have ever been more disappointed in an amazon product. To start with, the all over microphones seems like a great idea until you are trying to have a conversation with someone and the only thing anyone can hear is their own echo. the alexa integration would have been so helpful if it actually worked and kept a connection long enough to do anything. My most used apps are audible and spotify while I drive and neither could be controlled with alexa.  No matter what I tried through the spotify website and troubleshooting it could never be used to control the app. Audible itself worked but you couldn't keep the original settings from your app within the alexa interface. I tried for as long as I could but there was only so many times I could hear ""there's a really bad echo call me when you're out of your car"" before I gave up and went back to my trusty $20 AUX/Bluetooth converter.

I have had minor problems with connection, but I live in a rural area with spotty internet so that doesn't surprise me either. By the time I get to the main road, everything is working fine.Occasionally the sound gets scratchy. I haven't figured out why as it just comes and goes randomly.

Apparently Echo devices are only capable of playing from streaming services. It has NO way of accessing music already on your device. I have no wifi in my car, and I don’t have unlimited data, so this feature is USELESS! As far as directions, I wish it would integrate with a maps app you already have on your phone as opposed to just using it’s own cloud-based service. I already have lists of recent and favorite locations on my phone, but there’s no way to access them through the Echo device.Overall, it’s a shockingly limited device given what Siri and other voice-control interfaces can do.",1,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

It works much better with ringer on and volume up because you can control volume with your phone as well as the car radio. Just remember that if you get a call so you don’t get startled or blow an ear drum lol. (Exaggerated) hook up was a super easy and quick. I purchased a different holder for it that sticks on because here in Arizona, blocking part of the air vent is out of the question for me!!! I have put the hooks on yet to simplify cords because I just got my stick on adapter holder thing and I forgot where I put the box 🤦‍♀️ Can someone post a picture of the box 😂 seriously tho",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,1
"This Echo Auto is not what I expected. There is no way I thought that all I had to do is connect it to my phone and there would be the World of Music available to me by my voice alone in my car! WOW! The Sound is better than my Radio or CD selections. Unbelievable. The problem is I no longer want to listen to anything else!Now for the next UNREAL addition; my phone is now accessible through this device No longer have to turn down the music to talk to anyone, HANDSFREE! Terrible Problem, Right? Thanx Amazon!",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"You have to daily reconnect this to your phone. Does not always respond, you may have to unplug and reboot several times. Sound quality is only as good as your car stereo.

"I regret buying this product wholeheartedly. I STRONGLY advice no one buy this product!Firstly, I was stupid enough to buy the Amazon AuotEcho BEFORE reading the plethora of bad reviews and hoped my experience would differ from those who came before me. Alas, my hope was misplaced. Every point brought up by previous reviewers was realized with my experience. The Echo connected with my phone once and never connected again. For those unfamiliar with the way the AutoEcho works, it must connect to your phone to work. Therefore, it worked the first time I used it and NEVER worked again.",1,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

"So I've had a 1st gen Dot in my car for quite a few years, just connect to a mobile hot spot on my phone and go.  When the invite for this came up, I had decent hopes but ended up going back to my Dot within two weeks.  There are some glaring problems with this, specifically the App has a few problems and it fails miserably if you have more that one driver that wants to use it.The Good:  It's small.  Fits better if you don't want a hockey puck sitting on your center console.  That's really about it.",1,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I received this as part of the early release.  I used it in a 2008 Acura(no bluetooth), the setup in the car was easy, a little challenging getting it connected to the phone, but a couple of attempts and phone and auto device were connected.  Overall, voice recognition is good, even with the music being loud.In the spring, i set it up on my boat, this is where the device really shined.  I installed it in the cabin and Alexa was able to respond when i was fishing, etc.  I was amazed that it would work over cabin /boat noise, etc.",4,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I have a 2012 Versa, and the Alexa Auto has given me 100% hands-free capabilities like I never thought I would enjoy as long as I have this older car.  It is fantastic for playing music, of course, but also lets me make and receive calls and operate navigation safely and easily. It's probably the best $25 I've ever spent at Amazon.  I did have a bit of trouble the first few hours using it, but it turned out that I was just being impatient--I hadn't been waiting for the tone after giving the wake word. Once I got that figured out it's been smooth sailing all the way.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"One bad review i read said that after they take off from home it will give you a no service etc msg.  Well yeah prob because as you are driving away from your wifi at your house its still trying to connect to it.  I wait till i get away from the house and it works fine.  I have noticed that commands are improving.  I have not used it for navigation only for quick questions on store hours, play music, continue my book etc.  I like it and use it every time i get in the truck.",4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Installation:  Not even sure how or why it started working.  The steps for setup were unclear, and Echo seems to only connect to Alexa when its in the right mood.When it is connected, which is about 75% of the time I try to use it, it works fine and I can access most Alexa skills.  HOWEVER,  there is nothing this Echo gadget does that I cannot do with my Alexa app on my cell phone through the Bluetooth system in my truck.  So, I would say that the unit is little more than a glorified adapter and really isn't necessary if you have a newer vehicle.  I could see this being an excellent tool for classic car owners, who don't have these kinds of capabilities, but with satellite radio, and cars with bluetooth active, I am not all together sure its necessary.  I am less than impressed and if I didn't order it at a dramatic discount six months before the release date, and/or paid full price I don't think I could in any way justify the expense or recommend it.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

Pretty much only for playing music hands free. It is recognized as a separate device from my phone so if the passenger tries to search my phone using Amazon music there are questions and confusion about which device alexa should use. It is also terrible with directions and won't display using my phone's map devices. I'll probably just go back to using my phone.It would also be nice to include microphones on the bottom instead of 8 on the top. I was mounting this upside down hidden underneath the storage hole in the dashboard but now the microphones are all pointed toward the floor,2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I had allot of hopes for this device, however my experience has been full of glitches and awkward use.Mainly, the device works as a Bluetooth speaker for your phone that outputs out of your cars speakers. This might be what you're looking for but for me was a little disappointing. Pretty much any request given to Alexa auto just goes to your device. For instance, asking for directions just pulls up directions on your phone, asking for music just pulls up Spotify on your phone, ECT. A good car mount for your phone can give you better functionality really. Furthermore, the device was rather glitchy, many times I would ask it to do something and there would just be no response, she heard me, thought about it, and did nothing.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
Trash!!!! This is like a beta test that they are selling of the real product. Constantly loses Bluetooth connection I know it's not my phone because I have a ton of Bluetooth devices that connect fine. When it does connect the sound sounds like a tin can she will not recognize my voice worth anything I literally have to scream before she picks up. Do yourself a favor get an  aux cord.

"I got this thing on ""invitation only"" for $24.99 and I am not satisfied with it at all.  The connection is poor, it's slow, and most of the time Alexa will not respond.  I don't have this problem using Android Auto so I know it's not the connection to my phone.  It worked fine at first, but the more I use it the more frustrating it gets.  I'm going to just use the Android Auto app and not put myself through the hassle of trying to get the Echo Auto to work.  Save your money, it's not worth the $24.99 I paid for it and definitely not worth the $50 it's selling for now.  Amazon needs to fix this thing.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"Skip the air vent. Get a little magnet and stick it somewhere convenient for you that allows you to tuck the cord out of sight and out of the way. Pairs to the phone perfectly, does a great job of hearing voice commands even with the windows down or the sound up loud. My only complaint is the Alexa app is garbage and has trouble staying connected. This is not a problem with Echo Auto it is a problem with the Alexa app. The Alexa app has been a problem since Amazon released it, long before Echo Auto existed.Be warned that when using this to get directions you have to open your phone and tap a notification before your map app will open and start navigating. I always start navigation before driving and my phone sticks on my dash right in front of me so it’s no different than if my car had a nav screen built in and not an annoyance to open the phone first.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

"Set up was easy. I enjoy listening to my Amazon Music Unlimited in the car. I have occasional connection issues, however. Between the car, the phone, and Alexa Auto, not the internet.

"Thought this would help tie together some regular functions that I use in the car, hoping not to have to mess with navigation on phone, music selection on car system, initiating calls, ... As others have mentioned it often takes several minutes to connect and then gives a nebulous response  - never telling you when it has finally connected.  Vice commands for navigation are pretty much useless - once it misinterprets your request, you have to go back to the phone to correct it.  It seems hesitant to respond and has trouble hearing you over it's own output and other car noise.  Amusing but not the answer for broad voice control while traveling.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I gave 1 * for sound quality because it doesn't produce it's own sound... It relies on either your phone speaker or car stereo for sound. So the 5* rating there goes to my car stereo, not Alexa.  It's fun to play with. Does a hell of a lot... Make sure you familiarize yourself with it's functions BEFORE you take it out on the road. My first couple times in the car with it was spent arguing with it 90% of the time. But once you get it down she's pretty cool. Better than Google.  PS. OH!!! it has 8 mics in it. So she can hear you even if you have your music blasting.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"its a good thing to have specially if you are into this kind of things, but is still at a very early stage, one thing that is a letdown for me is that is heavily relies on your phone, for me its common that the alexa app on the phone crashes and until that gets fixed the hardware wont work, and the support for alexa has been awful about this, the other part that is kind of tricky to figure out is the driving, like asking for directions to go home, specially with Waze is still a bit buggy",3,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
Thought this would be much better. The pros are that it automatically connects to my vehicles Bluetooth. You don’t need to open a separate app to start using.Cons: sometimes I have to give Alexa multiple commands before it responds. Sometimes I can’t  hear the first words of alexas responses. Sometimes the audio comes out of my phone instead of my car when the Bluetooth is connected. Doesn’t play nice when navigation apps are running with music (Prime music).,2,1,2019-10-21,1,1,1
"I have not had an opportunity to use it except to ""test"" it.  It was simple to install and passed all my testing.  What I do NOT like and the reason for the 4 starts is the power cable.  It is very obtrusive and unsightly.  I bought two of the Auto Echos - one for my adult daughter for Christmas and one for me.  My daughter did not like it because of the cable and asked me to return it.  I don't like it either, but will live with it.  I As a result, I will use it only for road trips and not for local driving.  I'd prefer a rechargeable echo so that the cable would be necessary only to recharge.",4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"First off let me start this review by saying, the Alexa Auto is pretty cool.  Let me continue by saying, it is not a necessity.  It is cool like a new toy.  Does one need a new toy? No! but we all like new toys.I have used it primarily to play music through Pandora and Amazon Music, and it sounds really good.  It is sometimes a pain in the neck to connect it to your phone (which is needed), but after setting it up each time you enter your vehicle it is  a continuous stream of music (like satellite).  For this reason I thought it was great.  I haven't used it to turn on my lights or many other things but look forward to playing with the capabilities in the future.",4,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
I have had the Echo Auto now for several weeks and I am very happy with the performance.

"Alex Auto would have received zero stars if I left it connected to my OnePlus 6T Android.  The connection always dropped and I was unable to use it most of the time.  I reset and reconnected it to an iPhone XS Max and it's been pretty flawless since.  I still have the occasional bug with connecting and sometimes Alexa will say music cannot be played (through SiriusXM) *while* the music is playing.  Overall, for $25, it's worth it.  I hope Amazon figures out a way to integrate Alexa Auto more fully with OEM displays - this is my key complaint right now.  Instead of showing the song that's playing, it shows the channel you are on which isn't overly helpful.",4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0

Alexa is constantly saying that it lost connection to the phone, even when the Alexa app is open and the Bluetooth says it’s connected. It also takes so long to start up once the car is on. Even a simple task, such as stating, “Alexa,” takes quite a while for the Echo Auto to acknowledge. We REALLY wanted to love this, but it needs a serious firmware update.

"Meets expectations in every way as most Amazon products do, but I honestly don’t use it that much except to ask the weather outlook.It sits mounted on the dash next to my phone. The iPhone gives navigation, phone capability,  music, etc.  Siri seems to know how to start pandora as easily as Alexa.  (Although not much else - ditz). Most of my music is in iTunes which Alexa can’t get to.  I don’t use it to make phone calls and don’t text while driving (no one should).",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"Works very much like your Echo device at home.  It would be nice if it had a chargeable battery so you didn't have to have a USB cable hanging from your dashboard all of the time. It would also be great if it could drop in on your devices at home and let you communicate through it. That alone would help it to stand apart from your phones built in voice assistants (Android Auto, Google Voice, Siri, etc..). The main thing that bugs me is having to manually open the Alexa app to verify that you are a ""passenger"" every time you start your car, it's counter productive to do if you're already driving. When I'm on a long drive I sometimes test the Echo against the Google Assistant on my phone to see which one more accurately understands my request. They are pretty close but Google usually is better at navigation and music (probably because there are more selections on YouTube Music than Amazon Music, like remixes for example). Overall it is a decent device, I just think it needs more to set it apart from free apps that basically do the same thing.",4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

So in order to have back everything as normal I have to restart totally the bluetooth connection with the car...this is supposed to be a hands free device!? Also if I receive a calling while listening the music, everything works good on answering the call but then the music remain in pause constantly until I ask Alexa to keep playing...a little annoying.

"I spend a lot of time driving and Alexa is a good travel companion. She answers my questions, plays my music, reads to me, and keeps me otherwise entertained.

I remain pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"This is more trouble than it is worth.  The vent holder bent and would not hold.  The inline cable doesn't work at all.  If you ask it for directions or other things that Alexa says it can do, you must have all the settings on your phone correct and your phone has to be connected.  You must be able to choose appropriate output - which means USB or inline but directions weren't clear on that.  With everything I had to go through, it was easier just to use my phone - Alexa didn't do anything that my phone didn't already do other than connect to Amazon music.

"The initial setup of the Auto was pretty straight forward and quick. I was very impressed with how well it worked right away - then I turned my car off.  The next morning I started my car and Auto would not work until I logged into the Alexa app on my phone. I asked how long it would take to get to work and received an immediate answer. I turned off my lights from the car (connecting with my Hue lights was flawless), then I started my commute. When I was on the road, I wanted to see how well it worked at streaming music. I asked the Auto to play my playlist and was answered with “I can’t connect right now” message. I thought it was odd as it was connected just minutes before. After doing some troubleshooting, I realized that because my car is within range of my home wi-fi, the Auto was initially connected to my home network. Once I was out of range, it takes a while for the Auto to reconnect through the cell connection.  I’ve learned to work around that issue but it is slightly annoying - especially when you want to show off your new toy.Over the last few weeks, The only gripe I have is the random connection errors.

There are some quirks which is understandable but not being able to match your home wake word if you don't use Alexa is a huge flaw.

"It was very difficult to set up.  Loved it the 4 times it actually worked, then It went offline. Have not been able to get it to  connect again. Customer services fix was to uninstall the Alexa app (in case it needed an update), then reinstall the app. I find that solution unacceptable. Why should the app that works fabulously with all the other devices, be uninstalled and reinstalled, to fix one faulty device? I think that is a lazy solution to “maybe” fix a problem with a product, that maybe...just wasn’t ready to be released, and should have gone through more beta testing. I haven’t tried connecting it again, as I am still deciding if I want to go through that frustration again, or send it back to Amazon as a piece of rubbish. Thank goodness it was only $25, so I’m not out much money. I definitely have learned to read through a lot more reviews on any new purchase though, as the Echo auto did not really get very good reviews. Apparently, similar problems are an issue with this device. It’s too bad, as the few times it worked, it had great sound quality and was easy to use.

It's hit or miss if it will connect, which becomes so frustrating that it's not worth using.

"This is my second purchase of an Echo Auto.  I now have one in both of my vehicles.  I love having the same Echo experiance in my cars that I have at home.  I have three Echo there.  The only problem I have with the Echo Autos,  is connectivity.  It seems that it comes and goes.  I don't think it is Auto Echo, it may be the blu-tooth connection to my Android phone or problems with phone to cell tower.  Have not been able to pin it down yet. Just not as reliable as I would like.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"ZERO STAR AMAZON Company you should be ashamed for releasing this without proper testing. I wasted a lot of my time trying to get this to work WOW  I get to drive it to UPS and get your free shipping.Echo Auto just would not do anything when connected via blue tooth or Aux cable. It would just give the confirmation tones then nothing. I talked to Amazon Tech. support but could resolve the problem she said that she would turn it over to the Echo Auto department and the get back to me, no such luck on them getting back to me. So I returned the Echo Auto at the special introductry 1/2 price so I guess if I try another on I get beat on the 1/2 price. I do NOT recommend this product it's to buggy. This was the most disappointing product I bought from Amazon.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"This is not quite as useful as I was hoping, simply because it requires me to log in to the Alexa app before I can use it, which is less than desirable to do while driving. However, with the new iPhone upgrade, I was able to make a shortcut to allow it to automatically open when my phone connects to the car, so that helps! I really wish that it had a small speaker of its own like the dots, I would rather not have it take over my car’s stereo system just to get the feedback to make sure that she puts what I ask for on my grocery list. I mostly end up leaving her silent while I tell her to add to the list. Sometimes it is there, sometimes not, but at least I didn’t need to hear her voice blaring through my car.",4,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"I really wanted to love this - I had an older car without bluetooth and thought that with a bluetooth speaker, this would be perfect.  Long story short, it wasn't.  It did not want to integrate and worked only sporadically, mostly when I was at my house and it connected to the home's wifi rather than the BT speaker.  Unfortunately, the car didn't last me through the winter, so I thought, great, I'll pop this into the newer car that did have BT audio but there, too, it only worked sporadically, when it feels like it, it seems.  so now it sits in the car as I've been to busy to bother about it, and if I talk to it, yes, it responds, but only to say that it can't find my phone, which is right there and connects via BT to the car every time, just never to the Auto Alexa.  I was expecting great integration with audible books and my online radio choices, but did not get that at all.  Oh well, some things have to fail, I guess.",2,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"Connects fine to phone and car through bluetooth.  Problem is it is very unreliable when giving it commands.  I can ask several times to play music but it just pauses for 5 seconds, beeps at me, and turns off.  Plus sometimes even though it is connected it tells me i have to manual open alexa app on phone to reconnect.  Kinda messed up being hands free if i have to mess with my phone to use it.  Works great otherwise.  Pairs great with music playing and map function at same time",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
Would have given it a 4 or 5 but it suddenly doesn't connect to my phone and the alexa app can't find device. It works well if you aren't going through a dead zone. I never got it to make a phone call. Never had time to figure it out. Right now it's on my kitchen counter while I try to figure out why it can't connect. Maybe this needs an upgrade. Great concept and useful as I can tell it to turn my lights on at home before I drive up. But it needs to be more reliable.,3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

Sometimes music wants to play from phone speaker instead of car speakers. Sometimes it plays out of cars GPS only speaker. To fix this I’ve had to close out of app. Unplug phone from cars usb and then open the app again. Also, the response after asking a question or for music is much slower than from echos in the hope.

"I've had Alexa Auto in my car for about a week, and the jury is still out. There are some things I like about it, when it works. I like being able to add to a shopping list when I think about it, or playing Jeopardy. But when I tried to ask for directions, it tired to direct me somewhere a thousand miles away instead of the local place I wanted to go to. I have to have the setting on Bluetooth or aux in order for the sound to work, which means Alexa won't respond if I'm listening to my satellite radio or any other sound source. Also, I played an audiobook with a character named Alexa and every time Alexa heard the word, she tried to respond and even though I said ""stop"" and ""cancel,"" the recording froze and played that section over and over and over again - I had to fast forward past the spot. As I said, I've only had it about a week, and maybe I'll find it's worthwhile, but for now, I'm not finding a lot of advantages.",3,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
I love this device.  It's fun to use in long trips and if you have kids it's a melt down preventer lol. Just makes everything much easier. I live it pulls up directions on my phone when needed in a pinch a quickly. Sends text messages and makes calls and places orders or items on ur shopping list all in one place. I had an app for audible and for making calls using voice and a different app to send text and with this echo auto I've been able to remove those apps and make more room on my phone and do everything I need in one place through my echo auto. Can't live without it.,5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,1

Also, I had hoped the AA would integrate well wit a mapping app but it doesn’t see to do that very well. However, it does all the other Alexa tasks very well and the microphone array picks up voice commands very well.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
My first and my last Alexa product for sure. I'm not sure how it is supposed to make life easier but it doesn't listen half the time. I should have named my children after it.

"This is a clever idea, but highly duplicative of current technology such as the iPhone and therefore of very little value.  . The issue with the Alexa, was that it unpaired every time I took my telephone out of the car and have to go back into the app to try and reconnect.  It’s issues are greater than it’s value candidly.  Therefore, the Car Alexa became a useless piece of equipment which I simply do not use and I do not see how anyone else can find them Benedicial either.",2,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
I want to say I was a little unfair with my last review. But it spawned a response about this product from Amazon to see what was going wrong. Turns out it wasn't the products fault it was the need of a phone update and a complete reinstall of the Alexa Echo Auto...… after the Amazon tech contacted me a we walked through  everything together we had a successful installation. Can't thank my tech Cheyenne enough. Now Alexa is with us as we drive. I recommend this product.,5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0

I was able to get it all working within maybe 20 minutes all in my garage. I was so excited I went on a late night drive. Since then it has not reliably connected or worked. I've tried to repair to the app dozens of times in different settings.

"I use this product primarily to listen to music. It takes multiple attempts to get a response, song titles sometimes but usually don't show up on my car display, occasionally they don't show up on the app, and since the product doesn't have a memory it's frustrating that every time I shut off the car I have to stay over with whatever I'm listening to. I think Amazon may have rushed this product to market. It's just not good.

"I use my Echo Auto more that I use the system that came with my new Mazda. So much easier to use than trying to get my car to understand what I want. Directions, Audible, music, etc. its as easy as ... well...talking. And Alexa does so much more. ""Alexa, where is the closes Starbucks. Alexa, at 5:00 remind me to pick up dry cleaning."" My car cannot do anything close to being as helpful as Alexa. Does it have a few connection problems sometimes but the ease of use and usefulness more than makes up for the occasional drop of service. If I had another car, I'd buy another Echo Auto. As a matter of fact it would be a great Christmas gift for my husband's RV.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,1,0
"Setting the Echo Auto up was a chore although the process is straight forward.  It would pair the device, then lose connectivity, i had to do this numerous times and physically drive to another location before it finally held (fingers crossed that i didn't just jinx it).  Maybe the new location was just coincidence, but it worked.I was able to get Sirius working without issue, traffic directions took some doing to finally get Waze to play nice.  At first Alexa would chime to notify me that a turn was coming up but it wouldn't speak the directions, it does now (not really sure how or why it is, but it is), now if it could just show the route on the car screen and not just the iPhone.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I would have preferred velcro (to install under the dashboard) versus installed within air vent.  The closest charging plug for the echo was unfortunately nearest the air vent in front of the infotainment screen.  Also when playing iTunes via bluetooth, and verbal exchange with the echo will cause iTunes not to replay automatically.  Otherwise, the echo met my expectations.One other item to note, the wire guide in the center of the echo does not hold (glue/adhesive gives way).",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"This has a difficult time connecting to the phone every time I get in the car.  It seems to matter which order the phone connects.  If the radio connects first it says it is not connected even though the phone shows that it is. In fact when I turn my blutooth off the Echo will ""ding"" that it has been disconnected.  I turn off the bluetooth and back on to get the echo to recognize that it is connected. Also whilst trying to continue to listen to a podcast it jumped 5 episodes and then would not listen to any command to get back to the one I wanted to listen to other than ""previous episode"". I do like the sound to let me know it is connected that is helpful.  I also noticed if the phone is still connected to WiFi it has a hard time doing anything but if I wait to wake it up after I have driven away it works fine.",3,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"Connected once. Called tech support and was on the phone for hours trying to get it to connect. Somebody broke into my car and stole the charging cord and cord to connect to the phone but left the Echo Auto ( they must have read the reviews and decided it was not worth the hassle).

"I was lucky to get an early invitation to buy the Alexa Auto.  I've had it for a few weeks, and it works nicely.  However, there are a few glitches.  It sometimes loses network connection, which then makes it useless until you stop and troubleshoot it.  When that happens, I revert to Siri, rather than using Alexa.  That is where I become concerned there isn't a compelling use case for this device.  If I can get the same (or better) functionality using Siri, I'm not sure what the long-term usefulness is for Alexa Auto.  Since Alexa doesn't have any GPS capability, it sometimes doesn't know my location for requesting directions, so that is also a reason I revert to Siri.  Until yesterday, Alexa was an easy way for me to listen to Spotify handsfree, but now Siri is integrated with Spotify.  I'll continue to use it, and hope that some new compelling skills come that make the device more useful, but for now I see it as a product still in development.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Needs a lot of work. It constantly disconnects and I have to un-plug at least once every car trip. Relies on your phone so if you are in an area of lousy signal reception, it will stop working.

It will work great for your first drive after initial set up. After that it will take for ever to connect and ask you to open the alexa app to reconnect. Its basically useless unless you have a long drive and are willing to spend 3 min setting it up before hand. Your phone also need to have its volume all the way up. So it shard to tell if its working if your volume is low. There is no way to tell it to have its own vol. The 4amp usb car plug is the only thing worth a damn.,1,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
Ive had Alexa in my car before the Echo Auto even came out. ( echo dot with aux cord and phone hotspot). I do like how the Auto bluetooths to my phone without me having to turn my mobile hotspot on. Which gives me the access to use the GPS. (This is the only difference I have found). It does start up and connects quickly. And took me 2 seconds to add device to my Alexa app on my phone. Not sure why everyone else is finding it difficult. My only dislike is the vent mount as it blocks the air vent from opening and closing. They need a magnetic mount with suction cup or something. But over all satisfied.,5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"One of the primary reasons I purchased this was to control my smart locks and other smart devices (as advertised by the way) via my voice in my vehicle.  I got this today, hooked it up excited to try it out when I got home only for Alexa to tell me ""smart locks are not supported by this device."" WHAT!?!?!?  Why not?  Is this coming soon?  Bad enough I can't change the wake word to match the rest of my echo devices but now it doesn't work for one of the main reasons I wanted it.  In the email Amazon sent welcoming me to my device one asking if the front door is locked and opening the garage doors are examples of things it can do.  In reality it can't do these tasks.  If this doesn't change in a couple days it's going back to Amazon.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"The Alexa app doesn’t always easily connect and sometimes fails altogether. I can’t tell if it has to do with my phone service in our rural area or with the app itself.

I mounted mine on a tray in the console to avoid cables flopping around. The unit is useless unless you change your radio input to Bluetooth or Aux which then cuts off everything else. So it’s Alexa or nothing. Due to this it just sits there. Has no location ability although it connects to my phone which does.

"So, I was an early reviewer of this product and initially, it was neat. But now, I'm questioning why I have this. Other than giving me the ability to stream Bluetooth audio in my 2005 model car, there is nothing this device does that my phone doesn't do. And this device requires a phone to work!

I already loved Alexa in my home and couldn't wait for the auto feature.  It does everything Echo does at home plus more. The sound quality is great. The responses are great. And I was able to drop my XM radio subscription and save money.  I ask her to set my thermostat at home when I leave work so the temperature is stabilized by the time I get home.

Instead, I purchased velcro adhesive strips and attached the device to an inconspicuous location on my dashboard. You would even know it was there.

I love Alexa! I had accidentally found myself talking to Alexa in the car! So I often wished I could have it. Now I do! I would say it works very well for everything Alexa. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it seems a bit glitchy. It will pause for seemingly no reason. I may have to give the request a few times and it seems highly dependent on the strength of the cell network that I may be driving through. This can be frustrating.

"For the most part, I love it! It will hear my voice say ""Alexa"" over loud talking or music; it responds just as quickly as the other echo devices. However, there are two things that need improvement. One...every time it powers off and then back on again, I have to get on my phone, pull up the Alexa app (even if it was already open in the background), and click the button ""I'm a passenger."" This gets old if you make frequent stops. Two...occasionally, the sound will slow down, ever so slightly. It gives Alexa a slightly deeper voice and changes the sounds of audiobooks and music. To fix this, all you have to do is unplug the device from the car lighter socket, wait a couple of seconds, and then plug it back in. This happens rarely. Overall, I am very pleased with this product. Hopefully, they'll work out the bugs soon. As a side note, the mount wasn't designed for the kind of vents in my car (as it states in the description and directions). To get around this, I cut off the top of the mount at the bend and superglued the mount directly to my dash. It looks great, works well, and it doesn't obstruct my A/C.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
I have many Alexa variations.  Not great integration with my newer car that has Carplay. (To be fair this is pointed out in the description)  Buggy.  Needs more integration development across the spectrum.  Best part about it is that the mike recognition and easy button push. Might be useful for long car rides.

Don't hit that! Since I got past that, it connects every time! I read these reviews, and I believe the negative comes from operator error, or the car/phone out dated. I can drop in on my kids/husband at home when I'm on the road, turn my lights at home on/off, set reminders, of course, listen to music, and so much more with just my voice.

Works well for asking questions.  Works when asking directions.  Integrated with the phone and was easy to get to work.  Biggest issue is you can't use it to play your audio books unless you have internet connection the whole time.  If you lose bars while driving your audio book stops playing.  Pretty ridiculous considering the audio book is already downloaded on my phone.  So should just play whether you had a connection or not.  The bluetooth doesn't go away.,3,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"It’s been helpful using alongside Amazon music. The navigation integration has been ok. It will ask you to confirm on your phone and then it will use the Nav app. Better than using my card nav though. Alexa doesn’t always hear very well. She seems to hear complex words without a problem but then play some random song when it’s something simple. We laugh about it but it could work better. Also she has a hard time with road noise or when it’s louder in the car. Our kids like it because they will call out songs and she will play them. All in all, I’m enjoying it.",4,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

I don't think my car is too loud, but it still has trouble hearing me. I am sure it will get better. It would be great if I could listen to Youtube TV on the echo.

Then it takes a long time to even get it to come back up. The new issue is that if my phone (iPhone) connects to my Chevy MyLink, then Echo Auto does not like responding in any way. So often, it wasted minutes before it can connect. I got this on the invite in the beta group and honestly, i really wish that I could send it back because it is totally not worth even the discounted price that I got it for.",1,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"This is my first Amazon Echo product, and I was very excited when I received an invitation to get the Echo Auto before it was officially released. My package came with the Echo Auto, a 3.5mm audio cable, a Micro-USB cable for power, and the vent mount. For some reason, I did not receive the dash mount with my package which was what I was hoping to do instead of the vent mount. The directions say to put the vent mount at the top of your vent, but for my car, putting it near or at the bottom worked best. In terms of using the product, it's just like using any other Echo device. Simply say, ""Alexa."" Wait for the audible alert acknowledging that it's listening to your cue. Then, you can get it to play music, navigate to places, add stuff to a shopping list, etc. Overall, I highly recommend this item for anyone who doesn't have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto but does have an auxiliary port and/or bluetooth in their car. I've also found that I'm less likely to use my phone to input navigation or finding a song on Amazon Music, so if you're looking to go as close to hands-free as possible on the road, this is the product you may be looking for.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Honestly I’m super disappointed with this product. I bought it because it describes it as blocking out road noise and having several microphones for making calls while driving. I have an ‘08 Ford Escape that I have to connect this by aux cord to and there’s no way to make calls hands free In my car, and during my hour long commute I usually talk on the phone for half of it. Nobody and hear me!! Apparently I echo constantly and it sounds very staticky. So I can’t use this for the reason I purchased it. Plus, I find Alexa extremely finicky to use. She even struggles to start playing my books on audible, even though audible is through amazon. I end up doing everything with my hands that she’s supposed to be able to do. The one real good thing is that it has great sound quality for listening to Spotify through the aux, but I can’t even do that hands free.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0

For anyone on a limited data plan on their phones, you'll find you're using up a lot of gigs while listening to music, books, or even directions.I find that the transition from WiFi to Phone data could be troublesome.

"Until I installed the Echo Auto in my Jeep Compass, I didn’t realize I had a poor factory-installed radio. The sound quality coming from the Echo Auto is EXCELLENT! I had many difficulties using it with Bluetooth because my iPhone kept making me say I’m “not a passenger,” so I finally hooked up the included aux cable. I don’t like the look of the cable dangling, but it’s worth the hassle gone. I absolutely love using the Echo Auto for all of the Alexa skills I’m used to using at home.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
I don't want my phone notifications going through the echo AT ALL.  I don't want my phone calls going through my echo EVER.

If all your car has is an audio jack then this will greatly enhance your car experience.  I use this on my 2011 Toyota Tacoma.  It has a basic car stereo with an audio Jack.  I have tried other Bluetooth devices to connect my car to my phone but those always had issues and no built in voice recognition.  If you are looking for a good interface for your older car then this is a good choice.Pros: This integrates so well with my phone and existing Alexa enabled devices.  I often stream my music or different radio stations easily from my car.  Starting and stopping audio books is a simple task if it is on Audible.  Hands free calling was not something that I could easily do before.  Now I can ask it to answer the call and the mic does pick me up well enough to be heard by the other end.  Connecting to an older car is a snap if you have an auxiliary jack.  This is the most reliable Bluetooth voice enabled device that I have found my older vehicle.,4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Thanks to the Echo Auto, I am finally cured of my road rage. Now I have Alexa rage! If you see me driving around screaming like a lunatic in my car, don’t worry, I’m not screaming at you, I’m screaming at Alexa. She didn’t work at all in my 2013 Dodge Dart; but I finally got her to sort of work, off and on, in my wife’s 2015 Honda. It took over 30 minutes of countless attempts to get the Echo Auto to connect to both my iPhone and the car. Talking to Alexa in the car is like talking to a very elderly person—she is slow, hard of hearing, and a bit senile. You have to say her name and then wait a few seconds before telling her what you want. Please speak slowly and distinctly and try to be patient with her. When playing music, you will have to wait 3 or 4 minutes between songs. She will often forget that you want to hear music and go silent. Remind her, and she might just start the music again. But please don’t try to skip a song because she will likely become confused and stop working altogether. And don’t ask her for directions because she probably won’t know what the heck you’re talking about—she’s from out of town apparently. So if bad drivers and ubiquitous road construction crews are not providing you with enough driving frustration, pick up an Alexa Auto and experience a whole new level of annoyance!",2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"This needs a lot of work . Navigation is useless,it doesn’t understand street names. It would be nice if it would respond to you as a Bluetooth  phone call so you can listen to the radio while using it.

Unlike Google Assistant it doesn't support text messaging which is a key feature that I use when I'm driving. The other issue I have is that whenever I ask it to play music from Amazon Prime, it plays it through the Alexa app instead of through the Amazon Prime app. This is more of an annoyance than anything else. The Alexa app isn't user friendly when driving. On a positive note, when I asked it to get directions it open Google Maps on my phone.

"My home is a VERY smart home thanks to Amazon Echo!  In fact, I am so accustomed to 'talking' to my home, that I found myself trying to 'talk' to my auto.  Now, with Echo, I can... an do.  My vehicle is a Ford Escape.  Having said that, the Echo Auto works well with For Sync with the understanding that there are different inputs/sources (FM, AM, XM, Bluetooth, etc.).  Echo Auto works through the bluetooth input.  If you want to listen to FM, for example, there is some back and forth input toggling involved.  However, you can also ask Alexa to listen to your favorite radio station through apps like i heart radio, etc. and not have to change inputs.  What is keeping me from giving the 5th Star are these needed improvements:1)  Please allow a Wake Word choice option!  As I said, my home is an Echo smart home.  My wake word at home is 'computer'.

"- First, it only connects through one phone--so, if you're listening to someone else's phone (music or audio book or podcast), as often happens with my kids, you can't interact with it because it only blue tooth connects with one device!  It should provide for the ability to connect with multiple devices, like cars do (somehow--maybe through the app) & allow the user to select which, if it detects more than one in proximity, having a preferred default. I'm not sure exactly how this would work since the car has to connect to one of the blue tooth devices it knows.  Somehow, when someone asks a question of Alexa, it should supersede the current device connected to the car & speak through the car's speakers.  If that's not possible, then have a local speaker that it uses when it's not in charge of the car's speakers.- Second, it loses connection with my phone frequently.  When I am alone, so I'm listening to my own phone, I have to reset it because Alexa says it's lost the connection with my phone.",2,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

"I love the Alexa ecosystem and immediately ordered the Echo Auto when I received my invite. I had no problem with the setup. Up and running right away. My problem with Echo Auto is that Alexa on it is frustrating. She doesn't respond and then does not play the song or game or whatever activity I am requesting of her. Compared to our Echo and Dots, she does not pick up what we are saying well and often gets the song or request wrong, if she does even respond. I would not recommend that anyone buy this first generation of Echo Auto.",2,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0

I had high hopes for this but unfortunately sometimes it doesn't respond to your voice and it stalls and it gets stuck where you have this blue light steady on when you ask something and it wont reset so you can ask again.  I have to unplug it and plug it back in order to start working again as you ask whatever to it.  Overall its not bad but it will make you annoyed sometimes which is a downfall for me specially when you are driving and can't reset it to make it work again.,3,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
Disclaimer...we were given this as a gift from our insurance company.  With that being said I would not have spent $$ on this Echo device.  It rarely connects to my phone network without having to be unplugged first.  If I am able to use it for something it will not go back to the audio source that I was using.

Once connected the unit performed exactly as I hoped.  However, cable management is and issue and the vent mount offers limited choices.I would like to see some accessories for the Echo Auto to address the mounting and cabling issues.  It would be have to have an adhesive based mount that could adhere to the dash, and allow adjustment for positioning the Echo.  I would also like to see a cable that connected both power and audio through a single cable that could be split as necessary at the attachment points to the vehicle.

I also use Amazon Music, as well as Audible, so Alexa was able to instantly access both. Navigation works fairly decent for a basic ""find me a McDonald's"". I still use Google for specific addresses. Alexa makes phone calls for me as well, but my overall car audio is less than ideal. I prefer my Google Assistant on my phone with speaker phone. But that is probably a car issue not an echo problem. I like to be able to add to my shopping list, check my calendar, and turn off my lights as I pull away.

I’ve had to kill the app on my phone to get it to reconnect to it. I’ve also had it get into endless loops and forced me to unplug the echo to get it to stop. A minor annoyance is that while on a Bluetooth call the light on the auto turns green. After hanging up the green light does not always turn off.Now, I’ve said a lot of negative things but when it’s working it does work well. I use it to play music mostly but have also played games on it when with the family. It’s nice and helps break up long drives.

The volume is on and up on my phone and the car. I set it up on a 6 hour road trip and worked on it for hours.

So it’s hard to be spontaneous like it is in your kitchen. Also it only works on the phone that set it up (I think), so another driver can’t use it. Too bad; I use it very frequently for these reasons.",3,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0

I think the issue is more software than hardware. I like the look and feel of the device itself, but overall it had a LONG way to go. I think I paid $24.99 for the device itself and the vent attachment came along with it.

Like all echo products the installation is easy and all you need to do  is connect the USB to the car charger adapter provided and you are good to go.  However, in the event that your vehicle is a little more ""senior"" and not bluetooth enabled no need to worry you can use the provided auxillary cable and you are fine.  The only negative drawback is that thee is a need to open up the Alexa app whenever you enter into the vehicle, it does not automatically connect when you awake Alexa but once you open the app the echo works fine to retrieve your music, make calls etc. until you leave the vehicle.

My problem is that my car does not have Bluetooth connectivity, so I don't know if that is my problem or not.  However my phone will lose the connection every time I remove it from the car, so that when I get back in the car I have to re-connect it every time and it takes a minute or so.  It has lost its connection while I was actually driving and in that case you have to find a safe spot to pull over and try to reconnect it, but that has probably only happened 3 times since I had it.  I'm pretty tech savvy so I don't know if this is a user operator problem or a product problem.  I like the idea of the hands free operation that this device is capable of especially since the state I live in recently passes a law that we are not to touch are phones while driving.

The one thing i didt like is that from audible it used to automatically just start playing and i wouldnt know unless i was on the aux channel, they seemed to have fixed this bug though, the other audible thing is that when i have left the car it still shows it in the background of my phone,  not playing but there even when i close it it comes back.

Add to that easy voice phone calls or dictating texts, and I can easily keep in touch when I'm on the road. This is our 2nd Alexa Auto and we're ordering one for our daughter and son-in-law!",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"A very disappointing experience. As much as I love my echo cylinder. The auto has been useless. It seems that it has troubled to pair up with my phone 10 times out of 10 attempts. So rather than being a support, this device has become a very serious and dangerous distraction. Do not waste your time and money. I thought I was going to get rid of my XM subscription. Rather keep paying for it than allowing Alexa kill me on the road. Not even 1 Star! Boooo, Amazon!",1,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"When it works, it is the best thing ever!  I love the concept of having Alexa with me in the car, so I jumped at the chance to buy one of these.  BUT, if anyone remembers the old Net Meeting program where you spent your time asking, can you hear me now?  That’s what this is like.  We spend our time asking, Alexa are you there?  Sometimes, she’ll connect right away.  But then, ask her to answer more than one thing and she loses connection....and most of the time you don’t get it back.  The device itself works well.  WHEN she is connected, she answers you just like at home.  It is the Bluetooth connection that is not yet ready for prime time.  When they improve this, EchoAuto will be a wonderful thing to have.",3,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
It connects to my phone fine. However I almost always have to open the app on my phone manually for it to connect. Most of the the time it just doesn’t respond to commands without explanation. Then IHave to troubleshoot it. Not sure what,3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"My car is older so I have to use the audio cable connection.  My phone does not always connect to the device, right away, other times it does.  It just not consistent. Also, if wearing my phone on my hip Alexa often says internet connection has been lost, this can be irritating when listening to music.  Overall I am glad I got this device, but it will likely work much better with a built in internet connection in the car itself.  Blocking of the mobile phone signal due to position is irritating.",4,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"This product does exactly what it’s supposed to do. It easily recognizes and responds to your voice, even over loud music or road noise.However, it does everything through your phone. I was hoping that it would use any Bluetooth-enabled device, such as connecting to the Bluetooth on my Garvin Nuvi GPS when giving directions. But it just opens the Apple Maps app and then the directions come from your phone. So it essentially just opens the apps on your phone for you.",4,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"I have a car that doesn't come with bluetooth, i looked into several ways to modernize my stereo and ended up purchasing an bluetooth aux adapter, unfortunately it wasn't very streamlined. I didn't like that the setup would require me to manually start up the adapter. The Echo Auto is perfect in that it turns on along with my car and is ready to go within seconds. The sound quality is good, although i have had issues with Alexa hearing my voice. Overall since I wasn't looking for a Alexa device, I haven't really used any skills but for playing music, directions and answering calls the echo auto works perfectly.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I asked for an invite for this a long time ago and was excited when I got chosen to try it. But it isn’t quite what I was expecting based off of all my other Alexa products. It took about an hour to finally get it set up and connected to my phone, and there really isn’t a great way to mount it without a cord flopping around and a vent covered up. It does play music pretty well and can add things like reminders and items to your shopping list, but that’s about it. I’ve had about a 1% success rate with making calls, as it usually tries to call a completely different name than I asked for. Navigation has been an exponential disappointment. I haven’t been able to get it to pull up the right place even once.At this point I really don’t use it for much other than music, as anything else is more than a bit frustrating. I love all my other Alexa products and think this will be amazing once they get the kinks worked out, but for now I can’t say I would pay $50 dollars for a hands free music device.",3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I like having Alexa in my home because it works well to connect lights, alarms, audiobooks, and music through one system that can be shared throughout the home. I was excited to get the echo auto to extend that integration into my car. I get it and set it up only to discover that I can't change the wake word from the default ""Alexa"" to my preferred ""Computer"" which is how I have the rest of the echos set up in my house.  Amazon has their excuses for this such as ease of recognition for the device and the lack of need to distinguish between rooms which echo one is talking to. These are not good enough to be considered reasons for not including one of the selling points for having this system.I have a friend named Alex who is often in my car (and house, in part the reason for ""computer."" also Star Trek). I am used to using ""computer"" throughout my house and it makes for sense as a wake word for me and my housemate. ""Alexa"" does not work for me as a wake word and so being able to set it to ""computer"" is a huge part of why I like using Alexa.",1,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
I was disappointed by the echo auto.I felt like this was released before it should have been. I tried out two of them before sending them back for a refund. They constantly would say “trying to reconnect to your phone” when trying to use them. I also had to cycle power every time I wanted to use them because of the connection issue. This was common from what I found when researching other people’s issues.,2,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

I was worried that I would have to choose one or the other, but once paired it works fine if I am connected to Android Auto.  I love it now.  I have it connected to my to-do list...and I always think of things I need to do on the drive to work, then forget once I get there.  Now I can add it before I forget.  Totally worth the price.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"At first when using this device I did not think much of it. I thought it could do the same thing as just being hooked up to my phone connect in my auto through Bluetooth. So why Would I need  this device?  Now I have several echo devices in my house and truly love them.  After playing around with the echo auto for several days. I started to understand it’s practicality while driving and fell in love with it. I could easily use it for driving directions and location questions,  phone calls, quick dictionary when needed, news briefs, weather, listening to music and changing the genre of music I wanted to listen to  depending on my mood. Now I depend on it and look forward to using it when I drive.  I’m always recommending it to others.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"Alexa can hear me when my music is loud, and I love it. There are a lot of kinks to work out because it drops connection A LOT. I mostly have it to stream music in my car (completely hands free), but I will have to often times disconnect the Bluetooth, and reconnect it when she can’t establish an internet connection (this is on a daily basis at least once or twice a day). My music will play via Pandora... maybe half the ride home? And it’s a 20 minute drive on a good day. My Anker Bluetooth device doesn’t have Alexa capabilities, but my music is constantly connected, and I would rather switch songs manually than argue with Alexa for 10 minutes off and on because she just won’t do what she’s supposed to do.",3,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0
"I was a little concerned because I have an unusual set up. I own a Jeep GC with Uconnect. My personal phone is synced up to the Alexa App but my work cell phone is set up to my car bluetooth so that I can take calls while I'm driving. Also, I have an iPod plugged into the USB port of my car.  So with that being said, everything seems to be working fine. The only thing is that my work phone is dominant to my car so when I start it up, i have to go to settings and make sure my personal phone is active.So my first week has gone great. I can stream Prime music with the Echo Auto or switch to my iPod for music. If a call comes in on my other phone, the Echo pauses and the call comes through the bluetooth in the car. When I hang up the call, the Echo resumes. In addition, I can skip to the next song with my vehicle's touch screen. Really working great so far. Will follow up after more use.",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"It is great to just speak and ask questions that I'd ask in my home. Integrates with contact list to make calls too. I worry about data usage but no way around that. The only downfall so far is that with windows open or top back on my '18 Jeep Wrangler JL it has a hard time hearing me even at lower speeds. Also volume is off from the radio so when switching back my radio is too loud.Though the holder is not supposed to work on my style vents, it has. The rubber clip was tight enough to hold on to my Jeep vents when positioning the vents vertical. Has held for weeks now and even in the hot South Carolina sun.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,1
"OK... I like this little unit BUT there are several things not to like.  My connection is perfect as long as I do it in this order:  Turn on car, turn on blue tooth on my phone, wait for that connection and then plug in Alexa. That is the only way it connects and stays connected. The music continues to play on my phone even after I tell Alexa to stop, unplug her, turn off the blue tooth connection AND the car.  It is so frustrating.  So far, I just use it to listen to music.  I did use the navigation to guide me home from a concert and it worked great. But I don't understand why I have to touch my phone to get the navigation to start but maybe someone knows what I'm going wrong.  There needs to be a better mount but luckily my car has a small ledge under the USB port so it slides nicely in that spot.",2,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
I set this up in my garage within my home WiFi range. Once I got through the tedious set up I was amazed. It did everything I hoped for. Then I pulled out of the garage and found that it could no longer connect to the internet. I drove around figuring that the cell phone reception in my neighborhood was weak and I tried use it again. I found that I had to go through the tedious setup again. Still no luck connecting. I guess I will have to stay in my garage to use it. That’s not going to happen.,1,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"I was able to get this early in return for a review. I wanted to make sure I gave it the fair chance it deserves and having it for 3 months now i believe i can. I am very familiar with the Alexa ecosystem as we have several echo dots, spots, and shows in our home. This was the first in a vehicle. Other reviews have hit on several issues both good and bad and in most areas i agree. I would like to speak to my specific use as it is unique but extremely useful. My wife's van has satellite radio built in an we both enjoy the service. My vehicle is a 2009 BMW that did not have satellite radio. I am able to use the app on my phone with her van's subscription and stream directly to my cars radio via Bluetooth. The only issue was changing stations as I would have to look at my phone and scroll to find etc. With this device i can tell alexa to change the channel by name or number and this works perfectly. I also did not have to purchase another subscription since the app version of Sirrius XM is included with her package. I do not use the device for anything else as i have not found anything applicable to my needs that my car doesn't have already. I also installed the device on top of my steering wheel neck as this was both more aesthetically pleasing and functional. Lastly my vehicle is a convertible and i am able to communicate with Alexa without issue while the top is down. Overall i gave it 4 out of 5 stars and plan to keep it in my vehicle.",4,1,2019-11-21,1,0,1
"The Echo Auto has a long way to go. It doesn’t recognize my voice half of the time, and the connection is sketchy as well.It also keeps flipping between my phone and the car radio.  It is constantly on yellow, so I feel Alexa is always listening to us in the car.  It will not do any commands (play a song, give the weather, etc.) until I ask Alexa the time.  It is almost as though asking the time wakes her up to perform tasks.  Annoying, to say the least.",1,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0

"I was excited to be selected to receive the auto echo earlier than when it went on general sale. I have a 2014 Nissan Armada with blue tooth phone but not radio. I connect through USB. After hours and multiple attempts to connect I was unsuccessful. I wound up giving the auto echo to my sister. It connected easily to her car. I asked for specific locations like “closest gas station” and it responded quickly. It played specific songs when asked. Response is a little slow at times. I tried to connect to my sisters iTunes songs but she had not connected that feature yet. During Pandora requests, the echo auto frequently did not respond to requested song selection but picked he first song listed. I asked my sister if this echo auto broke, would she get another one?, she said no. After my limited time with it, I would order it for my next car that has Bluetooth music connectivity.",3,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
Never worked for me and would not connect to IOS Bluetooth BUT Amazon just called after I left the first part of the review and asked what they could do to improve the item. I was pleasantly surprised at how much they care. I can’t give a higher rating because my initial experience was bad. But I am willing to possibly purchase again and try it now that the kinks have been worked out. So thank you Amazon for actually caring. 5🌟 for customer service,1,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I have an older car that doesn't have bluetooth.  Echo Auto added that to my car.  My setup is that I pair my iphone and echo via bluetooth and then the echo audio out to my car's audio input.  I used to have to run the audio cable from my phone to the car input which meant I could not talk to my phone because it thought I was using a headphone.  I can now talk to both my phone and Alexa and use whichever is best for whatever my purpose is.  The most significant problem I've encountered is the poor quality of the supplied audio cable.  Using it, my echo is was too quiet.  I replaced it with another audio cable I had and it significantly improved the overall volume and performance.  Listening to Amazon music is pleasant.  Using it for driving directions means I have to touch my iphone to accept the suggested directions but this is partially the fault of the iphone maps app.  After replacing the audio cable it worked nicely when I wanted to interact with my shopping list.  It relies on my phone's LTE connection and the Echo will sometimes say it can't connect to the server even though my phone shows a good connection.  After a minute or two of driving, the clears up again.Best feature is that it added bluetooth to my car.  Worst, poor audio cable. I look forward to seeing how this product develops.",4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"My favorite purchase maybe ever. I love the echo in general but having Alexa in the car is amazing. I have been using it for a few weeks and I think it's near perfect. Great sound. Easy to connect. Having my unlimited music plan in the car is insane considering I grew up with a radio in the car and nothing else. Tape players were cool. The CD player was awesome and then the MP3 CDs!! Being able to connect iPods and phones was living in the future. Now this. I couldn't have dreamed of something this great. Seriously crazy, I love it. The only time I am disappointed is when my phone drops connection. I am in a pretty rural area and I honestly am surprised how little it happens. I like driving with the windows down and I don't even have to yell. I am loving it.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"When I had a Samsung phone I loved Alexa auto. It was so nice to hear my audiobooks, or listen to music etc in the car., make phone calls too. The directions were not the greatest so I did not use it for that. Then I got an iPhone 11 and unfortunately, the Amazon Auto will not connect, so I cannot use it anymore. I am so bummed out because when it was working with my old phone, it was so great to have Alexa in the car. I hope they can fix this issue and I will try again.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Great little product that seamlessly connects to your phone, after an initial headache of a set up. I haven’t had issues connecting with my phone, without interaction from me, unless I exit the Bluetooth range of the car while it is on.

The ability to do most anything in the vehicle without touching a device is something everyone should use.",4,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
I added Echo Auto to both my Volvo and Mini. Adding Bluetooth integration in both these cars is normally expensive and a pain.  But Echo Auto was as easy as plugging into AUX jack.  Presto — Bluetooth integration for calls and music (including my Sirius radio subscription)! Only downside is that Alexa’s response time tends to be a bit on the slow side and sometimes has trouble making an initial connection to my iPhone - requiring application and device restarts.,5,1,2020-3-11,1,1,0
"If it connects right away then it will work great. Sometimes I have to disconnect my phone from my car's native system and turn bluetooth off and back on to get a connection. Sometimes the car shows the source as bluetooth, but I still can't hear the echo auto through the speakers. It should come with a speaker in case you are not listening on bluetooth source and listening to the radio. When I pull into the garage I have to unplug it to power it off because the phone will connect to it in the house and I hear a message over my phone call and then that source takes over. Not a great product and I wanted to love it.",2,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

First of all I installed this into my older car that had no bluetooth capabilities.  I run it into the AUX jack as the input source to my radio.Things I like about it are that it connects immediately to my iPhone X without me having to interact with it.

"It's not great but its good to have it. For me the response time is not as fast as a echo dot but gets the job done. The wires can get in the way so prepare to get some cable holder (even though it has built in cable holder but only on the end of the cable.) It can be tricky first time setting it up. I remember setting it up correctly the first time but didn't work then I remove my device from my phone and did the same exact thing and it worked which left me very confused.....Overall, this it's a good hands free device if you want to listen to music and navigate your way around.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

By 2 months into usage, my BMW started regularly throwing error codes and then my iDrive stopped working.

If it has trouble connecting for too long, I've been able to correct that by switching my phone to airplane mode and then back off of airplane mode.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
The echo auto is such a great easy concept. Have issues with it unless I have a Really good cell signal at times. Also the Alexa app drives me nuts having to agree every time I hit the road about operating while driving before the echo auto will even work. They need an agreeable statement that you have to agree to once and stop having to agree everytimr We start and stop our vehicles. Would be seamless if it wasn’t for that. That’s aggravating as hell.  They need to also do something about the volume limiter for sound. Seems the sound is higher out of CD and radio of my car... yes I have everything wide open on my phone and told echo to turn up the volume over and over. Still not as high as cd goes.,3,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

Overall I really like the Echo Auto. The voice recognition is good and the integration with my car has been great. My one complaint is how they have change how the Echo Auto mounts in your car. The original one had a sticky pad that went on the dash that the Echo Auto sat in. I love this. Then new one comes with a vent mount that doesn't work for my car. It's not adjustable so if your car doesn't have sloping vents it isn't going to work well. Go back to the original dash mount!,4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

I was worried this might be complicated but I seriously just plugged it in and linked it to my phone via bluetooth and it works amazing.

"A solution in search of a problem. Don’t get me wrong. We love Alexa. She lives in almost room in our house. She controls the lights, checks the doorbells, lets us know who is in our driveway and settles disputes between the kids with the “who’s turn is it?” skill. She’s great. She’s just not great in the car. First you ALWAYS need your car on the Bluetooth setting for this to work. Most of the time that’s our audio source, but not always. Strike one!  Then there is the lag when getting her attention. You say her name to wake her and then need to wait 3 seconds for a chime to confirm everything is working. It’s a subtle but annoying issue. Strike two!  Then, it’s hit or miss. Simple things like “what’s the weather forecast” work fine. Asked to play Beastie Boys from Spotify and sometimes she will, sometimes she won’t. You’ll be told to close Spotify on your phone and try again. Or you will get the confirmation tone, but the music won’t play. Strike three!  While I’d gladly add another Alexa to the other rooms in our house, I have no plans to add her to any other cars we own. I’d save your money and skip this if I were you.",1,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"This is a fantastic little gadget that seems to be working flawlessly so far. I can’t express how happy I am being able to use all the voice commands for my smart home when I’m nearing the house. Turning on the lights, opening the garage, setting the thermostat, I like to have these things on my trigger finger rather than the proximity, so this device works perfect. I like being able to cycle the sounds and also plays calls. I’ve been waiting for something like this rather than a nasty work around for quite some time and I think this is the perfect fit. This is a huge hit.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I WISH I could use this in my 2009 VW Jetta S. It has Bluetooth and an old dock for a 32 pin iPod. However, it does not have and AUX port. So the Echo Auto is useless in my car. The only way to get it to work is to buy a new stereo with an AUX port. What was supposed to be inexpensive and exciting turned out to cost more than expected and a disappointment.Do NOT buy the Echo Auto, even if you have Bluetooth, unless your car has an AUX port. This information should be stated up front before anyone makes the purchase.",2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"So I have been using the Alexa Auto for a little while now. Set up was a breeze and it is perfect for me as my truck is not equipped with any voice options. I have used it for music and audiobooks and it works pretty darn well. I have  also used it for phone calls and that is the only area I can see improvement could be had. Not always perfect on commands asking to make a call and while I can hear the calls fine, the callers occasionally comment about the noise. Other than that use it often and would recommend. Like any bluetooth device few are perfect.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"I have other Alexa devices in my home and I love them, so I was excited to get this one too!  It's sort of a love-hate relationship though.  I guess I was expecting it to do more than it does.  It does a lot of what most newer cars already do.  However, the few functions it does, that my car doesn't do, is well worth the money.I believe it's priced about right for what it does.  Since it is such a new product, there are some kinks that need to be worked out, but that's to be expected.  I'm hopeful it'll get better as time goes by.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"This review is based on connection via an iPhone.  I had high hopes for this thing, but it has a lot of problems.

"Overall, this works pretty much like Alexa at home.  However, set up was difficult.  I had to try a number of times before getting Alexa Auto to pair with my iPhone7 even though the phone showed the Alexa Auto ""connected"" via Bluetooth.  Repeating the automated set up, the AA app would get to the step to find available devices.  The device would be found, but when selected the app seemed to freeze.  Then suddenly it worked.  Once it did work, the app reconnected when I returned to the car later on without this problem recurring.  Also the delay between awaking and executing commands is much longer (several seconds) than I'm used to at home.",4,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I drive a 2005 Honda Element that is not enabled with bluetooth capabilities.  With all the new laws requiring hands free, the Amazon Echo Auto provides everything I need and more.  I have it connected to my AUX so everything comes through the car speakers.  The mount that comes with the Echo Auto sits securely in the vent and does not move with a strong magnet.Calls come in crystal clear which is what I absolutely need.  The extras that Alexa offers are a bonus.  I can have Alexa stream my Apple Music, ask what the weather report is, set a calendar date, etc... without taking my hands off the wheel.  *Note - it does take a good 30 seconds to fully connect once powered on.  I believe it's transferring from wifi to LTE, but honestly not a big deal.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,1
"It shouldn't be surprising that this first iteration of an in-car Alexa device is a mess. The mounting clip, the cabling, the awkward way the device itself has to be positioned in order to be halfway effective. It's also not very good at detecting your voice if a) you're driving with windows down, b) listening to spotify, a podcast, or the radio at any level whatsoever, or c) don't have a Lexus or some other soundproof car interior. Plainly said: this isn't worth $50. It's not even worth $10. After a few weeks of struggling to try and make this work, I threw it in the trash. A total waste of money and barely worth a one-star rating.",1,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0

"My wife and I have long talked about how nice it would be to have Alexa in the car with us. With this product, that's possible, but it's not as seamless yet as talking to an Echo, Dot, or Show in the home. The reaction time from when you say ""Alexa"" to when she responds is a bit clunky and slightly delayed, so the experience you are used to when interacting with Alexa on other devices is not consistent. At the end of the day, however, the product still delivers. Given the nature of the delays, it can be a bit distracting to interact while driving, best to let a passenger do the talking.",4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
Let’s just start with the most important thing. This is not a stand alone Echo device. It simply is a microphone array for the Alexa app on your phone. So for it to work your phone has to be connected to the car radio the Echo has to be connected to the phone and the Alexa app has to be active. Without all of that there is no functionality. And basically it is only the same functionality as the app but with a microphone array. It works about half the time. Not at all worth 50. I got it during the invitation period so only paid 25 and it might be worth that.,3,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0

I Amazon Alexa auto is a good product for someone who wants to be able to answer hands-free calls and play their music to their car with easy voice commands. I recommend this to anyone who wants to do these things without spending a ton of money on a new stereo system also to anyone who has a stereo system still adding Alexa is nice because it gives you the ability to ask it things for directions and other stuff.

Any media I play will occasionally just stop playing, sometimes not even turning back on by itself.

Alexa takes long time to respond and phone calls on this thing sucks.

I can easily play music or listen to any number of music/news stations with  a voice command. And games. Everyone in my family wants to play ""Song Quiz,"" and on road trips, that can go on for hours!  I love the Echo Auto Alexa works seamlessly with other in-home Smart devices. No more setting timers for the lights to go on at home. I just say, ""Alexa, turn on the front porch lights.""  I hate walking into a dark home when I'm the first to arrive. And with Daylight Savings Time gone for the fall and winter, it's a real benefit. This was a good value, for me.  I am your quintessential ""end user.""

With a newer version of the app and Amazon's suggestions, it is working much better than it did at first.  The device connects to your phone and your phone has to be running the app, so it requires a step to activate the app on your phone.

Perhaps I received a lemon, but after reading other reviews, it seems like this product is defective in principle. Too many connections needed to be reliable. It would be nice to just use the built in speaker for acknowledgement for turning on lights and such. I’ll stick to using CarPlay for everything else. I’ll be returning this.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0

We can’t pair more than one phone at a time (I’ve tried so many different ways) if there is any road noise or the air conditioner is in high we have to yell for it to hear us. The cord holder fell off within a week (it looks like it was glued on) Glad we got in on the beta and we didn’t waste $50 on this! I would love to see some improvements but I’m not holding my breath.

If I ask her to tune to a radio station fine however if I try to use the device for a handsfree call FORGET IT ITS TERRIBLE!!!!  Also this morning I asked it to set an alarm and it says okay Bryan.  Then two seconds later it says ""Sorry I can't set an alarm"".

It works well and I have only encountered on challenge and I suspect that once I figure it out it too will work - Alexa will dial numbers but does not let me talk to the person who answers the phone.  She also is happy to grab the phone connection if I try to dial when she is on (simply pushing the mute button does stop this)  I am sure she can use the phone but I am wondering if my 9 year old car some an older version of bluetooth  that might not be compatible.

Device does not respond to commands or gives error message that the connection has been lost about 90% of the time.

Tried for 2 hours to get it to work with my newer iPhone 8. The Alexa setup screens have problems. most do not scroll and many have text displayed over other text including buttons you are supposed to click. I was able to get the device to work with my wife's iPhone 8 Plus with the larger screen but not on my basic iPhone 8 with the smaller screen. The app never let me select the new device when searching for it. I suspect it was hidden due to the screen problem. I ""worked"" with support for over an hour on line chat. I gave up after the chat switched to the 4th agent. Tip! If you are asked to try something you had better be really quick or that agent will drop and when you respond you start allover with another agent. From a software company I expect better. The hardware appeared to work fine, it is the software for setting it up.

"I originally bought this without knowing if it would connect with my Bluetooth transmitter. Surprisingly it actually works well. However I really don’t use it in my car very often. It’s actually proven it’s worth in my studio as a Bluetooth interface for my iPhone. Since the iPhone lacks a headphone jack I now use the Alexa auto to connect my phone to my studio monitors. Now I can use all of the Alexa features hands free while I work. It’s better than an echo dot, for my situation, because I don’t have admin access to the WiFi at my job. It seamlessly connects to my phone and uses whatever network my phone is connected to, be it WiFi or cell data.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"I have pretty much every echo device and love them and was really looking toward to this one. The few times it worked, it was great! I could listen to any radio station I wanted on TuneIn or listen to my playlists on Amazon Music without the touch of a button, just a voice command. Unfortunately most of the times it did not work. It would take forever to connect or would not connect at all to my iphone via Bluetooth or Alexa did not respond and many times it would just make an annoying tone while trying to connect, I just wanted to unplug it. Over time it was more unplugged than plugged in so unfortunately in the end I returned it. The echo auto has great potential but in my case it rarely worked and it became a totally annoying device.",2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"I really wanted this to work as advertised . And it did for a couple of months. I liked it so much I bought one for my girl friend. She was able to use hers as a hands free device, able to make and receive phone calls. I, however never could get mine to make or take a call. But we were able to listen to music and radio stations through Amazon Prime.In the past weeks neither of us can get our Echo Auto to work properly. It will show it's connected, but won't respond. It's not the type of phone, I have an Android, she has an Iphone . We've resetting it up, unplugging, replugging,  anything we could think of doing. No luck, very disappointed.",1,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I got this early, but wasn't able to try using it right away. I am pretty much addicted to Alexa, and was excited to get one for the car. On the first attempt, I didn't have time to do a complete set up. But I went back and found it had synced itself to my bluetooth. I haven't used navigation, but on a long road trip, I was able to pull up info about places I visited, driving distance between towns, etc. I was able to listen to music in many formats. I set it to play music from 1967, for example, and that broke up the monotony of the drive. I do have to go into my car's menu to switch between Bluetooth and Sirius, and I haven't figured out to do that hands free. Also I don't want the thing stuck up on my dash. But I keep it in a cup holder until I figure out where to install it. Mine did not come with a vent attachment. I also appreciate the fact that Alexa is constantly being updated with added skills. I haven't brought it in on hot days, but I have had no problem with it not working. If this all sounds totally non tech savvy--well, that's because I'm not.",4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

"The Echo Auto is a great tool to have in my car. My car’s Bluetooth is pretty hit or miss typically, so I use the echo through aux and connect to the device through Bluetooth which is drastically better than the built-in. It’s fun to have the games and utility of an Alexa wherever I am, though it is not free of gripes. A main issue I have encountered is that when I exit and enter my car for the day the device rarely auto connects with my phone and I need to manually connect them. This is a minor issue, but my car’s Bluetooth as well as most other Bluetooth devices are able to reconnect with fair consistency.Also, make sure you connect it to a USB in your car that does not stay on when your car is off. When I turn my car off, the audio on my device continues to play through the echo even though there is no speakers on in the vehicle. I do have one other USB in my car that is not always on, but it makes such a long distance from the device to the plug that I have a series of wires running all through my dashboard which is a little excessive to look at in my experience. Overall, I am happy with the echo and will continue using it in my car, though I do hope there are maybe some connection and software updates potentially in the future.",4,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
With the to states I work and live in banning cell phone usage while driving this comes in very handy. Works even with my stereo blasting which i was very impressed by. Have had only one issue which has since been fixed where alexa would not back calls on my phone. I only wish that it could have the ability to read text messages from certain contacts if asked to that would be a huge benefit. One more this is I wish they would make a mountable magnetic mount so it can go in other places other the the vent but still be mounted.,5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

I bought this for my girlfriend to install in her 2011 Hyundai Sonata.  She has an iPhone 8.  The installation was easy and it connected flawlessly with her phone which runs through Verizon.  I think a lot of the problems people have a phone related and not because of the Alexa Auto.  She is also able to connect to smart plugs in her house to turn on lights and set up security protocols when driving.  You can also drip in on connected Alexa devices in your home to talk to kids or family members.  It’s a great product at a very low cost.,5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
I like to be able to use my voiceTo make phone calls however sometimes the device will not hear me at all so I have to wind up pressing the button for a command. Also sometimes it won’t work unless you press the I am a passenger button on the Alexa app which can be annoying . I think it’s very convenient especially when you can play music or listen to CNN or ask Alexa questions like my commute time etc. overall it’s a great buy and a great way to integrate Alexa outside your home while on the go,5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"Integration with my phone was a breeze and really does great connecting automatically right when the car starts. Integration of skills/automation really works well, have had only had issues with some directions/maps but not all. Finding gas stations didn’t work too well as I’d hoped.

Even though Bluetooth is not an option in my 23 year old SUV, the auxiliary input to my car stereo works perfectly with the Echo Auto tethered to the Internet with Bluetooth to my iPhone.  Never having to take my eyes off the road while having access to my entire music library, audio books and location/destination search and GPS navigation has never been easier.

Pros: Very easy to set up if you follow the step by step instructions.  I have a 2012 Nissan Titan with Bluetooth hands free and there is even instructions on how to set up correctly and not interfere with the hands free capability.  My Titan has a premium sound system so the Echo Auto sounds great through the system.  It is great the there is an Aux cable included with the Echo Auto also.  Once I set up voice recognition I had no problems issuing commands to the Echo Auto.Cons: Not much to list except that the universal bracket does not fit all vent types that is shipped with the unit.  It fits on the Titan's vent but is slanted downward quite a bit but still fully functional.  The cable guide that is adhere to the bracket needs to have a stronger adhesive as when the heat is used and it goes through the vent it basically causes the adhesive of the cable guide to let go and the guide falls off with the cables attached to it.  I had to use the Scotch 12lb. rated (extremely strong) double sided tape to get it to stay adhered to the bracket.  The cable guide does not come off anymore even with the heat on.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
First: Absolutely what I needed in my 2008 Prius since I have don't have Android Auto or Apple Carplay. The ability to perform tasks without having to take my eyes off the road is all by itself worth the price of admission.Pros: (1) Does not need to be dash mounted to hear and respond to my voice.

Echo Auto connected to iPhoneX ios13 on Verizon network.... Echo connected to Tahoe stereo through AUX input.  First I made sure to delete ALL previous bluetooth connections to the vehicle.

"It’s very rough but the idea is good and it shows promise. Here’s the facts: It will only work randomly and will turn off at any time. It would be vastly better if it were cordless. The sound needs work, it’s still muffled in my car coming out of the speakers. I’m not sure if this should be an actual hot spot itself but with a billion WiFi connections interfering with each other while driving, I think Alexa gets confused and just quits. There is a LOT of room for improvement, but hopefully echo auto 2.0 will be a winner.",2,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0

"I have several alexas at home and I thought this was an interesting addition to my suv. However I ended returning this device.  First of all it requires to connect to my phone (iPhone X) which not always automatically happens. Several times I had to reboot the Alexa to get connection.  Second, it requires power connector. This adds an additional cable to my set of cables in my car (radar cable, dashboard camera cable, usb charging cable). Third, I needed to manually change the radio from FM/XM to external device which complicates using Alexa while listening the radio.

"I bought the Auto Echo at a reduced price before it came out to the public so I could test it.  Boy, was I disappointed.  Trying to connect it took about an hour, and I'm very familiar with connecting Bluetooth technology, particularly in my car.  Then, I started using it & it only work sporadically.  Sometimes it would answer me & other times it would remain silent.  Then, the day came when I was listening to some music through the Echo when I got a call from my sister.  The music paused, as one would expect, while I took the call. In the middle of the conversation, though, the music started playing again and I could still hear my sister in the background. I tried EVERYTHING to make the music stop, yet it continued.  I then had to end the call with my sister & still couldn't get the music to stop.  I finally unplugged everything and turned off the car.  Only then did it stop.  I haven't used it since and doubt I'll try it again.

It doesn't connect with your car once you turn off your engine. Each time you start the car it connects to Bluetooth which is awesome but its always trying to connect Alexa.

As I get in and out of my car it auto reconnects through Bluetooth. For me as I have many echo products was worth it.

I had high hopes about Echo Auto and waited for full 12 months to get her. So here she is sitting on an air vent in my car. Echo Auto has full connectivity to Alexa services once you are connected to the internet. I use iPhone Xs as Alexa app provider and Bluetooth connectivity is good. What is poor relates to the app integration with other ones that may be in use at the same time. Alexa stalls quite often or can’t get to required service unless reset. This is annoying and in fact dangerous once you start playing with the device during driving. I was also disappointed with 8 microphones that were supposed to offer superb voice recognition.  It is O’K but in my filling not a notch better that one microphone on Garmin Speak that I bought when waiting for the Echo. And I must say that my personal preference is rather with the Garmin. It has a tiny display that can be used as a GPS. Small thing but makes a difference.,3,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

Under that level of road noise in Toyota Corolla in good condition, I typically have to shout to get Alexa to react, and misunderstandings abound.

It is so nice to switch stations, go from music to books, even silence, and still keep my fingers warm. It isn't perfect. It doesn't always get what I'm saying. There has been a problem of it not shutting off when I've cut the power out of frustration but overall, this is a device I enjoy using. It gets used everyday.",4,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"I got this as part of an invite. My car has Bluetooth but does not have Android Auto. Lexus recently sent me an offer to add Alexa to my car for $199. Getting this with all the same functions for a discounted price of $25.00 seems like a bargain! It takes about 20 seconds for the Echo to connect to my android phone and then we're good to go. Connection has been very consistent and dependable. I find that my problems derive from me turning the volume down too far so I can't hear when Alexa is live. I'm getting better at that. I like the turn by turn directions via google maps and may try Waze to see if there's a difference. Like all the gps apps, if google is accurate, Alexa is accurate.Playing music through Alexa has been great. Sound quality is really good and there seems to be no problem hearing me through the music for additional commands. I have been able to make announcements through my home Echoes from the car. For me this is easier than a text if it's just to let everyone know I'm on my way home.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

"Alexa Echo is fairly easy to set up... at first. However, unlike Siri or Google, Alexa requires additional set ups for just about everything.  She simply isn’t as smart as Siri or Google.  If I hadn’t gotten it for free, I would exchange it!  She’s basically useless other than playing amazon music and playing games such as True or False Trivia.  She isn’t humorous or capable of google searching.  I’ve been using her for a month now and am absolutely disappointed.For starters  She won’t call or text anyone who doesn’t also have an Echo device",1,1,2020-1-17,1,0,1
Took a bit of tweaking to get it to work properly.  This is 1st gen so I suspect the developers already know what to add and will add with additional gens.  Overall I am pleased with it.  I understand the limitations but eventually this type of tech will be standard in all vehicles.  I can monitor all my home devices from echo auto and I like the music capabilities.  Amazon Music integration has a ways to go but plenty of licensing bottlenecks there.  Works well for me.,4,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"Sound quality is decent when it actually connects but it is more of a danger than a help. It doesn't understand me, it ignores most commands altogether, it constantly disconnects and after about 2 months, it quit connecting altogether. I finally took it out of my car since I want my vent aimed at me and you can't adjust them with this on and it has been months since it was able to connect. Would have returned it if I hadn't received it for free from insurance company.",1,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I like the Echo Auto a lot and it works great to stream music and ask questions while driving.  The only negative I have is the mounting option.  It magnetically sticks to a vent clip but that limits mounting options and means I have cords all over.  I realize I can just put in in a cup holder or somewhere else but would be nice if there were other magnetic mounts to stick on and then attach the Echo.  I have some bluetooth connections issues with my iPhone wanting stream music from my phone automatically, but that is a car/phone issue.  I just have to get Alexa to stop playing and then play from my amazon music.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
I installed it in a 2015 Silverado. Ergo...the problem. My Silverado has a touchscreen that is very user UNfriendly. It (I)kept trying toBluetooth connect. WRONG!! It (I) went to MEDIA . WRONG!! TOOK 90 minutes total and 4 separate attempts.,4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I really love the Echo Auto, when it's working. It has a tendency to think my phone isn't connected to the internet when my phone is locked.I was fortunate enough to get an ""early adopter"" discount and saved $25, for that alone, the headaches it gives my are acceptable, but I think I'd be a lot more disappointed if I paid full price.",3,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
This is cool but has a major flaw.  It won’t play the music that’s on your phone.  It will only play a streaming service.I don’t have unlimited data - so I would be using up data listening to streaming services.,3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I have been excited about this item since before it came out to the public! I am extremely pleased. It actually works unlike the other items on the market. And it automatically connects every single time. Yes it does have to use blue tooth in your car, yes it connects to your phone. I thought at first, what’s the point? I could just use my own phone. But what’s the point in having Alexa in your house? It makes life so much easier!!!",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"When it works, which is most of the time, I like it and use it to open my garage door and otherwise operate my smart home as I approach my home or as I leave in the morning. But since it relies on my phone, I guess, sometimes the connection to Alexa doesn't fully work. I also cannot get her to change the song by voice. For that I still have to use my car and phone. So, it isn't adding much beyond what my phone could do by just connecting to my car in that area.",3,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
Finally was able to order one. been using it for about a week and its awesome. I have an older car with only an aux line in for the radio and this work great. Sound quality out of the Echo Auto is twice as good then the audio out of my galaxy phone. Hands free is a big time bonus and voice recognition is great. only wish it came with some double sided Velcro for mounting instead of just the vent mount. More cable clips then just 2 would have been nice also.,5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I love the concept, the device is small and easy to mount anywhere.  I have mine mounted in the center console of my Infiniti.  I usually have no problem with Alexa hearing me, even though she is tucked away.  My biggest complaint, reliability.  It seems whenever I have a passenger in my car and I try to show it off, it does not respond.  If I am alone, it works as designed.  It's rather embarrassing and its not making any sales for Amazon Auto.",4,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto was simple to connect to my car and phone. It is a great way to add some smarts to an older car. Asking Alexa for directions is smooth and the voice recognition works very well. One of her best features is asking her what your commute looks like to your destination. So far I've only used it in the town where I live, but I think it will be very useful while traveling when looking for gas, food or whatever. I've also found it to be much less distracting than looking things up in my phone while driving.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"This is a good driving aid, especially for drivers like me who have a mild handicap.  As a result of a mild stoke 4 years ago, the range of motion is limited in my right arm.  This makes it somewhat difficult to reach my car's radio controls.  So I usually have to reach a stop before I can safely change the radio's tuner or volume controls.  With my Echo Auto I can use my voice to control these functions.  It also nicely supplements my car's GPS device by allowing voiced en route inquiries.The only issue I've had (and which accounts for the low ""Sound Quality"" rating and the one star ding on the ""Alexa integration"" rating) is with regard to the audio routing: My car does not have factory installed Bluetooth capability so my Echo Auto is connected via the supplied audio cable plugged into the radio's AUX port.  For some reason, the Echo Auto defaults to sending the audio to the tinny speaker of my hands-free phone device rather than to the car's speakers via the AUX cable.  I have to manually force the use of the car's speakers through the Alexa app every time I start up the car.  Its a bother but a relatively minor one since I now expect this behavior and am prepared for it.  But it shouldn't happen since the device ""knows"" that its connected to the AUX port.",4,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0

I use this in my vehicle connected to the radio by auxiliary mode. I like having Alexa in the car with me but it's not as convenient as just turning on the radio to listen to music. Sometimes the connection gets lost or it takes awhile to connect to my phone. I also like being able to text my husband via voice or control the house lights where applicable from any location. I would definitely get it again and think it's worth the price I paid.,4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

My phone connects to my Jeep via bluetooth and I could get the echo to connect to my phone but when I would summon Alexa, it would tell me it is trying to connect.

This is the first Alexa device that i purchased that I was disappointed in.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I’m disappointed that I can’t use this as an auxiliary or even BlueTooth backup to my normal XM radio.

"I was able to get in the beta and I'm glad I did.  I see other reviews of people having trouble connecting or not listening but I'm pretty sure it's user error.  For connecting instantly when you start the car you have to have your Bluetooth already (on your phone).  For alexa not understanding what you're saying you can read prompts so Alexa better understands what your saying.  I have found I use it everytime I drive and for any reason, like sending messages, calling people , asking for weather and a bunch of other random things.  Give it a try, watch a video or read the manual first.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"An okay device, but needs improvement.Needs to lower music or podcast volume when it hears the Alexa command, so that it can hear me.

"The Echo Auto still has quite a ways to go before this becomes five stars. The Bluetooth connectivity was seamless and was quick to connect as soon as the engine turned on. The Alexa feature however gave me issues almost immediately. The first day was ok, I could ask commands without touching my phone, then by the next day it had looked like the app updated and I couldn’t make any commands without opening the app first. Then at times it doesn’t respond to any commands at all. Then when just using the Bluetooth feature it seemed as if Amazon Music was freezing when loading.Aside from music I tried to make phone calls and I was able to check on my kiddos while out (“Alexa drop into kids room”, “Alexa make an announcement.. Open the front door, I’m on the way home”) they already call me “Alexa call mommy”,  which calls my mobile. I seem to hear them just fine, but them/anyone hearing me is kind of fuzzy.",3,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"Overall I like the Echo Auto for very basic uses. I'm hoping in the future there are more features that can be connected to the phones.

Also the reminders would be nice to be connected to the phone instead of just Alexa.

I was on the list for a very long time waiting to get an invite but finally got one.  I have it set up in my 2005 Toyota Tacoma.  I plugged an auxiliary cable into the back of the radio.  I do like the way you have a vent mount now makes it easy to move if you want or need to.  The Alexa app needs some work I had to set the font at its lowest setting to see all of it on my phone now can’t read it with my tired old eyes.  It took over an hour with customer service to get it to sinc up with my  phone.  The device is only a one function at a time what I mean is on a trip I like to listen to audible books and navigate the map comes up on. My phone and the book plays but no verbal instructions just a beep.  If I plug my cell phone into the aux cable it plays books and pauses them for the verbal navigation instructions.  Over all I believe it is a good start and I know Amazon will improve it as time passes.,3,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

"I really like the Echo Auto. I have not really experienced the issues that are in alot of the other reviews. There appears to be alot of iphone users complaining. I have an Android. The review that said she didnt use the Amazon Alexa app to setup makes no sense because the Echo Auto requires the app to function and is purely an external interface for the app. I do not connect it to my vehicle via Bluetooth because my vehicle does not have bluetooth. The only connection issues I've had were caused by my phone. (Turning off the Bluetooth on my phone confusing the system, walking away from the vehicle while it was running disconnecting from the device and then returning.) generally under normal use it automatically connected with no issues. The only complaint I have is the navigation function. I rarely could get the directions to work without having to interact with the phone defeating the ""hands free"" functionality.

I like it and I use it in my car every single day to change SiriusXM stations and general questions. What I don’t like is that it doesn’t have an app to integrate to Waze so you can just tell her to take you somewhere. My biggest issue is that you can’t change the wake word and half the time when I get to my car I actually have to go to Bluetooth and manually connect it to my phone instead of it connecting every single time like clockwork.

I have a newer car that can do what this device can from a music perspective.  I just want this to work from a command capacity. In short, you HAVE to connect to your car's audio and cannot use it's internal speaker.

"I've had a lot of issues with this device, the voice recognition when sending a text message is awful. Alexa is delayed, hears the echo of her own voice asking 'what do you want the text to say', and then inputs her speech into the text message! I have tested this even while parked with no noise interference- the device is just not up to par with the other Alexa enabled devices I am used to. There is a significant delay when you ask Alexa to play music or to execute any other function. Half the time she does not interpret speech correctly. Also the mounting situation is awkward and I am not a fan of the clunky design. This was released way too soon and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it until major fixes are made.",2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"I was super excited to get this and was not disappointed! It can hear me pretty well over the car noise and music. When I ask for directions (to Target or something), it double checks if I mean a specific address, and pulls up Google maps and starts it right away. I can also call people, play music, play/buy audiobooks on Audible, check my commute, and check the weather easily. I always had trouble with ""ok Google"" hearing me on my phone to do all these tasks. I was worried about news articles saying it was mediocre, but for me, it works great! Only thing I wish is for Libby/Overdrive to have a skill in Alexa to resume audiobooks.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
This is a great device.  Works just like my echos at home.  Set up was easy and it paired well with my phone (Pixel).  My Honda Ridgeline (09) is a little behind on the technology curve so I had to use the AUX port for the audio but it works great.  Being able to just ask for the music you want sure beats pushing buttons or turning knobs.  My wife immediately stole my Auto for her car but I was fortunate enough to get a second for myself.  It has become second nature for the both of us when we're motoring about.,5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
Really wasn't too impressed.  It won't play all my music as it does at home. It could be the subscription.  It disconnects from the phone frequently....Update it does not seem to diconnect near as much as it used to.  I use a cable to connect to the stereo so I mainly use it to integrate my phone with my non Bluetooth stereo.  I use the app some but more often just to play the podcasts from my phone.  It's ok but still more a novelty.  I do use it to get weather forecast as well.,3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"The day had come, when I would finally have my invite accepted. My Alexa Auto was in route. I was beyond excited and couldn't wait to show-off my new technology.1. The design: the Device itself is small and then and has an overall, low footprint. HOWEVER, it requires tethered power and for optimal sound AUX in stereo. Those two issues made it look dated and clunky in my car.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I like the idea, but it doesn’t always function as it ought to.  It depends a lot upon your phone, so if you go through a low data area and lose connectivity, then everything stops.  It also takes several minutes to find the phone, meaning a short trip doesn’t let you use the echo auto for much before you arrive.  I do like that I can make calls hands free, but I wish the amazon music had better connectivity without dropping songs.  I’m disappointed that it didn’t meet the usual echo standard of quality, but I think they still have some time to fix the connectivity issues and make this a more useful product.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I am among the first to have an Echo at home.  The Auto version of the product is nowhere close to other Alexa implementations.

"My family and I were so excited when we heard there would be an Alexa for the car, but this product is just disappointing. It is a challenge to have the device hear voices, even the driver's when positioned directly at the driver. It mis-hears or doesn't hear at all. Additionally, the clip on for the air vent is a very poor design. I have horizontal vents in my car, just like the images in the product description. It should work perfectly, but instead the clip doesn't fully hold the product on and with the slightest jarring it falls in the floor board of the car making it useless. Additionally, the cord connecting it to the USB power supply is just cumbersome. It sticks out and gets in the way, adding another way for the device to fall.  What a disappointment for a product that we had such high expectations for before using it!",2,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"If you always leave the Alexa app open, it will normally connect automatically.  If not, restart the Alexa app.  On few ocassions, I have had to restart my car.

Sometimes I have to drive for a while before it connects, or I have to open my phone and open the app.  Twice now (for two days)  she wouldn't play music at all, she repeated what I asked, but then said the music would not play.  The main reason I bought it, was so I can play my amazon music and not have to fiddle with the phone, just ask her to play an artist or playlist, but am having a hard time connection and responding to play music.",3,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

When I first saw that Echo Auto was going to be a reality, I signed up on the list to have first access. That was about a year ago but it has been worth the wait. I use this in my car, in hotels when I travel.

It took me several tries to get the Echo Auto connected with my 2013 SRX but it finally connected.  I also have to have the volume on my car radio turned SUPER loud.  The most frequent response I get from Alexa is that it has lost the connection.  I did try to get directions to a particular location and Alexa said they were planning the route but that's as far as her helpfulness went; no route was planned.  I guess I just have not found Echo Auto to be worth the trouble.,2,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0

I got this as a free gift from my insurance coma at and didn’t think I’d use it much but it has turned out to be great at being a Bluetooth receiver for my iPhone as my car doesn’t have Bluetooth audio. It also makes phone calls easy too. I’m learning more and more things. One thing is that I can tell it to set my home ac to a certain temp as I was driving home rather than bring up my nest app on my phone before I start driving.,5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

I really wanted to be able to keep it  so I unboxed it and tried again ,to my surprise after 20 minutes or so it worked . I've enjoyed it off and on ,sometimes it will connect and other times I can try over and over till I get fed up with it and give up . When I get into my car to go someplace I don't have the extra time it takes to get it working .

"When it's connected, it works just like my home units.  The problem is - when I start my car, my phone needs to sync with the Bluetooth to the car's system first, but the Alexa Auto also is attempting to connect to my phone at the same time.  The result is neither is connected and I have to take out my phone and manually connect them one at a time.  My workaround is to unplug my Alexa Auto when I shut off the car, and then when I start the car and my phone connects, then plug back in the Alexa Auto, which then syncs with my phone and both work fine.  There should be a delay for the Alexa Auto to wait about 10 seconds before trying to connect to the phone.  Other than that, it's fun to have in the car as it works just fine.",4,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"We love the Echo Auto! I drive an older car that doesn’t have the fancy new options for voice controls. I love that Alexa can open my Audible book, or play music when I ask.  I am able to keep my eyes on the road, without having to suffer the silence of my car if I have forgotten to start my book before starting my drive. Plus, I can actually call the kids to chat with them through their Echo Dots.Best thing, though, is the hilarity that ensues when my oldest daughter asks Alexa to play a specific song, and Alexa plays something that is nothing like her request. Alexa knows my voice, but my daughter prefers to fight with Alexa rather than take the steps to have Alexa learn her voice.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I like the thought process behind the device, however it does need some tweaking. The first few months it worked just fine, but over the last few weeks I have been getting regular momentary drops in the audio and the app seems to lose its connection quite often, even in areas with full cell reception. I am hopeful that this can all be corrected with a future update, otherwise I am not sure that its worth the hassle when other options exist.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
Disconnects from Alexa app will not auto connect. The echo input is a much better choice for your auto especially if your car is equiped with built in wireless hotspot and Bluetooth.  The echo input can be paired directly with your car and your car wifi where the echo auto requires a phone.  This is cumbersome if you forget your phone or it is paired with a family members phone.  No one wants to run the setup everytime you take the car if someone else set it to their phone.  Echo input is less expensive and works a lot better.,1,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I get that this is an “aftermarket” item for your car and this is the first generation of the product but it just feels clunky to me. Had to try to get through the setup process about 8 times before it finally worked. It was frustrating. Haven’t used it too much in the car yet, only random questions like weather and sports scores to see if it was working. If you have a car without steering wheel radio controls, having to switch from radio or satellite to Bluetooth output, or if you use Bluetooth to listen to music on your phone, could get dicey. It’s a good idea to get Alexa into cars that don’t have it built in, but needs work to make the integration a little cleaner",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I ordered this with great expectations. We use the Our Groceries app to keep lists for a whole lot more than groceries. Seems like I always think of things while driving.

"So, the connectivity is fine. It recognizes about half of what I ask it too, which is also fine-ish. But what isn't fine is that my car recognizes any time the Alexa turns on as a phone call, which pauses the audio on the car. So, in the 5-10 seconds it takes to switch between the audio and phone display, Alexa is trying to answer my queries or confirm my selection, but I can't hear anything she says.I drive a Toyota Avalon 2015, this shouldn't be an issue.",1,1,2019-10-2,1,2,0
"After looking at options to add Apple Car play to my vehicle, this seemed like a no brainier.

That is my only real gripe with it.",4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"Has some room for improvement as any trial and first editions would. I was most interested in bringing Alexa and voice command music to my commutes to and from work. All in all does great, only request would be a more seamless link between songs. Sometimes you get those albums that flow well and a 5-15 second delay between the jams can be sad. (I would assume it is the lag time between talking to your cell network and back to Alexa) First world problems am I right? However, I have enjoyed trying out other random stuff like playing trivia on the commute instead, so there’s that. 10/10 would recommend. Peace!",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

I really wanted to live the echo auto but it fell short so quickly. My car does not have built in bluetooth so I depend on these devices to be able to use my phone in the car safely.The phone reconnects to the app everytime you start the car and it does not announce when it is ready to use. You have to attempt multiple times to get a response and sometimes it still fails. I have had to pull over to reconnect the echo auto to the app.,2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
I love the direction they are wanting to go but would like better integration with the whole phone instead of just the Alexa app and Amazon music. I have an iphone and would like to be able to do more hands-free commands like with Siri. I have also had a few issues where when my phone was locked she had trouble connecting to it. If I unlocked my phone she would then connect. The connection from my phone to my stereo is great. Just Alexa connecting to my phone sometimes when locked.

I have used the navigation quite a few times and if you are in a giant city with multiple of the same thing you are trying to get to it can be a little difficult to use but if you are in a smaller area with only one or two of the place you are trying to go it is pretty decent.

I took it on a 8 road trip and it entertained me with the games you could play, it impressed me how easy it is to change songs, and it was well worth the money.There are some downfalls. One thing is that when using it for directions it only makes a noise to signal your next direction. Why doesn't it read out the next direction like regular GPS? Another downfall is that the app gets stuck open on my iPhone. Usually I could swipe up on any up to close it. But when I swipe up to close Alexa and lock my phone, the app still shows my last paused song on Alexa. Another downfall is that sometimes the games get cut off and it does not continue after the signal is back. It should remember the song. Last downfall is that there are numerous times that it doesn't hear me say the trigger word. Maybe the microphone is not as high quality as it should.

Its funny, because I do it all the time with my echo dot at home, and when I trigger her in the car I noticed she will pause your music momentarily so she can hear you, so I know alexa can control my Bluetooth audio. Yet for some reason it just doesn't support that feature. Why? That's a pretty standard feature as both a hands-free car command and an echo device.Also, I wish it could read notifications from my phone as an announcement like android auto can.

You should know that you cannot listen to the normal radio then have Alexa work - it must be dedicated to the Media selection on the radio to hear through the car speakers.  It does however acts like an external microphone for your cell phone and will execute the commands as designed. simply ask Alexa to navigate to someplace and the cell phone will perform the task. It works well. the only issue I have is when I have two cell phones paired it gets confused and does not always connect. EXAMPLE: -My wifes ohone and my phone are bothe an option to connect to.

I haven't had a problem with her hearing my voice even with the music on and she is easy to set up. This fits into my lifestyle very well.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"This makes driving safer by eliminating the need to look at your phone for music. Also great for playing driving games and so much more than you could've ever imagined. Playing would you rather or never have I ever on long drives and listening to audible books without having to flip through your library without hands is priceless. Picks up where you left off and pauses, rewinds or skips without taking your eyes off of the road. I'm not sure about the touchscreen rating option but it's very easy to set up and use.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"More than likely this is because I do not have Bluetooth capability with the my car. The device has to be applied to envy of the auxiliary cord which does make it a little clunky, but I am grateful that it works. Alexa loses signal quite frequently. But that also could be due to the Sprint network in my area. There are a lot of steps and connections that need to be made to alternate accounts as well as Alexa prior to using all of the capabilities of this device. This is why I say it works mostly as a hands free device I still have to  Hang up the phone via my phone rather than telling Alexa to end because she just won't do it. For the most part it works well, better than I anticipated especially not having Bluetooth capabilities in my car.",4,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"First, it does work. I have installed it in my car’s ashtray and it works fine even with the lid closed. Other than your home Alexa which connects via WiFi this device pairs with your phone and if you want to use your car audio your phone must be connected through Bluetooth with your car. The phone connection is automatic when you install the Alexa app after you paired the device once. This said, the connection procedure can take some time depending on your cars’s pairing protocol with your phone. Which can be annoying on short trips. Other than this it is all smooth sailing. I love it. You can listen to the music or radio programs for freeeeee.And asking Alexa questions can be entertaining and helpful. Yes, big brother is listening in ( I believe you can turn this off) but so are the aliens from outer space if you like conspiracy theories.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,1

"I've been using them for more than 6 months now.  It is wonderful to be able to lock and unlock my front door without having to dig out the keys, especially when my car doesn't requires physically inserting one.  But the ""Alexa, give me direction to..."" wherever is not very good mostly because it doesn't know how to read my Google Contact address book.  You can get direction to establishments, but usually with a little bit of struggle.  It goes to sleep (disconnect with Bluetooth) a lot, so I have to wake her up by asking ""Are you there?"" before giving commands.  Also very easy to stream Amazon Music with voice commands.One neat trick I would share - I was able to install it in my (pre-Bluetooth era) Chevy truck despite it was explicitly on the ""Do Not Work"" list.  I configured Alexa Auto  in my late model VW.  Then take it to my Chevy truck that has a store bought Bluetooth speaker phone, and it works!

"So our family has tried to use this as we have traveled during the holiday season. We have tried to play games, but regularly answers were not recognized and points not awarded.

Love it. Not perfect but what is. I really only have two major complaints. First I can’t change the wake word. It is Alexa and you can’t change that. In my home most of my echo devices are echo so when I get in my car it forget and try to wake it up using echo and not Alexa. Next when in my garage I will start listening to something and I’m on WiFi. When I drive down the street I loose connection for sometime and will need to restart what I was listening. This is sometime I can live with but it is frustrating.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"Not bad. But not perfect either. I find it useful and good to have on drives longer than 20 minutes when I am just using it for music. It fails to connect to the internet perhaps too often. I usually fix this by unplugging it and plugging it back in. This may happen once every 5-6 times I get in my car. Once it’s connected and rolling, though, it’s a pretty nice device so long as your phone has decent connectivity.  I am not sure if it is worth the full asking price ($50ish?). But if it goes on sale for $20-25 then it’s worth picking one up. Again, if you live somewhere where cell phone connectivity is spotty, you will not see its full worth.",4,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

Apparently connecting to two things via bluetooth at the same time is a problem. I disconnected the bluetooth connection for my phone to the vehicle. The upside is Alexa will perform those functions for you of answering the phone. The other thing to be aware of is Alexa works only as well as your cellphone network. If you don't have unlimited data, you will want to watch your data usage. Also, if there are areas where you don't get good reception, or have dead spots... Alexa will not work.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

The vent mount is a bit flimsy, as the weight of the Echo causes the mount to slouch down and I have had to get a bit aggressive in putting the mount back into the vent slots.The device comes with a dual USB 12V adapter which is great because I also have a dash cam in my 12V aux port.

Whoever came up with the idea for an echo auto needs to find a new job. Any device that requires a Bluetooth connection should be outlawed. Why would anybody use old technology on new technology. Amazon should be ashamed for selling this. There is no internal battery so you have wires hanging all throughout your car creating a hazard while driving. There is no reasonable mount for this other than sticking it in your air vent. The connection constantly breaks causing you to have to restart your device and reconnect to Bluetooth.

It comes with an Auxiliary cable so tried that instead, it doesn’t cut out but it will only work for a short amount of time then quits and says “just so you know amazon music can play through Bluetooth on this device” and that’s it, it just quits.

Same result, even though my vehicle isn’t even in my phone’s Bluetooth connection options.",1,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
Really surprised Amazon would release a product that’s truly not ready for market. It has never worked. It can’t find contacts even though they are in the app. Getting directions is terrible. I bought this for my daughter who doesn’t have apple car play in her car. Neither of use working separately and together have been successful in getting this to do more than frustrate us. Tried to return and Amazon wants you to talk with their tech support. Gave up waiting for them to call me so I will just throw it away. Worst purchase ever from Amazon.,1,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0

I am not sure what I expected. Taking Alexa in the car seemed a bit weird to start. The feature I really like and use the most is Amazon Music. The Car Stereo in my Jeep is a little older and does not have all the new bells and whistles. I had planned to replace for something with Bluetooth capability. It does have an aux port so I plugged this device in and I have almost instant music playing when I get in.

The product won’t just act as it’s own if my phone is attached it will only  come through the phone - this I don’t need it to do... the auxiliary does not work so the only way to hear it is if you have a Bluetooth car—- it just makes it hands free because if you open the app you can do the same things with out the device - I plan on returning mine — but i definitely have some suggestions to make the experience greater —,1,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"the vent mount that it comes with does not work at all. it falls off. the rubber prongs keep coming off the main base and wont stay in the vent. they say dont allow to get hot yet make it to fit into the ""heat"" vent on your car so the hot air blows right on it.  Go Figure. the magnet is not strong enough to hold the unit. the unit has to either plug into a aux jack on your car stereo system or Bluetooth to your car stereo system. wont work without one or the other",3,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"Unless you have a vehicle with built in Bluetooth our a mini jack input for aux input, don't waste your time or money on this device.

It said my 2016 Nissan Pathfinder S was compatible with this device. We must have different Pathfinder 2016 S's because mine does not work no way no how. Great idea but needs much more research and training for it to be a contender. Googles version too. My hope is to find a Bluetooth transmitter on the same frequency.

"We are an Alexa family with many devices and were super excited to have one in the car, only to be majorly disappointed (and honestly, pretty annoyed). The idea of it is great, but it doesn’t work. You must have near-perfect reception on your cell phone for Alexa to, first, respond when you talk, and second, do what you ask it to do. Many times Alexa will light up when you say “Alexa” but keep glowing like it’s thinking. Or if it does respond to your song request, it will say “playing ‘song’ on Spotify/Amazon music” but it won’t play. I get irritated (especially when my kids keep asking over and over and over for a song) when Alexa won’t play. So I end up selecting Spotify on my phone like normal taking away the ease of having voice-controlled music (which is the whole point of Alexa).I REALLY wanted to love this device (and we paid a lot to have them in both cars!) but it’s completely disappointing. Maybe if you lived in a city and had excellent reception on your cell at all times it would work better, but for me, it’s just become car decor.",2,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I've had my echo auto for several months now and I really like it. If my windows are down or heat is on high, Alexa has trouble hearing me sometimes. For some reason, the volume is always low, so I have to turn radio up a good bit when using the echo. Every issue I've had so far has been fixed by simply unplugging for a few seconds. I've only had to completely reset it twice. All in all, I think it's a great product and I would recommend it.",4,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0

You have to click ‘I am a passenger’ each time you use it. Annoying enough, but mine would often force me to close the app and reopen just to get the app to communicate with the device. That’s a doublewhammynannie. Not acceptable. Sometimes i would have to unpower the device AND restart the app to get them to like each other again.

I can honestly say that this version of Alexa is amazing! I have had Alexa in my car using another brand but it was never as reliable as this one! The whole car now seems integrated with Alexa which is mine boggling lol. Especially how I have it set up ( refer to the picture) I didn’t like the vent base because it was too bulky so I glued it upside down underneath the AC controls and it works perfect and looks amazing especially at night when the lightbar lights up. I am buying this echo auto for all my vehicles!! It’s just too cool lol.,5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,1
I have made 6 phone calls to customer service trying to get the device to work...Alexa comes on and says lets get started but will not respond to any commands.  The customer service reps have tried their best but at each call I gave up after 90 - 120 miniutes because I was tired of being in the car.

"My review is tentative - my experience is limited so far.  Initial impressions are favourable - it certainly has potential.  However, so far I’ve not found a ‘knock-out’ function.  As with all Alexa devices it’s early days and the ‘intelligent functionality’ is evolving.  Right now I have a full suit of Smart Home  devices - so a smart assistant integrates well with my concepts.  I trust Amazon will develop it further!",4,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

"Having almost more Alexa products than rooms in the house, I want to love this product. When it works, it's great! However, there seem to be more connectivity problems than I would like to deal with. Setup was quite easy, although it took learning that the Alexa app needs to have access to data (and not just wifi) was something for which I needed help. It has a bit of a learning curve and, at times, seems to work without hiccup. In fact, there are times when I stop listening to something because I'm getting out of the car and it returns as soon as I get back in and turn on the car. However, there are times when I am in the middle of listening to something and it just stops without notice and, despite not indicating connectivity problems, will not continue for whatever unspecified reason...so, there are some bugs that need to be fixed. I'm sure as the technology progresses things will continue to improve!",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

Useful item. But the accessories are ridiculously over priced. I am one of the invited and did not get a vent mount with my Echo Auto. I have to lay my Echo Auto on a small ledge on the dash of my car and worry that the sun does not melt or destroy it or that it goes sliding somewhere. I would like a visor mount so I could get it out of the sunlight and out of sight. But such a mount may half as much as the Echo Auto unit cost.,3,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

This product uses your phone’s connection and if you’re running other apps in the background it effects the sound quality.

SoMakes it look a little ugly.  might just remove it and put her in my cup holder.  So you can’t really see the cord.

I wish that I was able to disengage my home alarm - which is the main reason I bought it. Due to security reasons, voice input is not allowed to disengage the alarm. This does make sense, but I wish that I had known it earlier.  Also, switching from listening to my radio to aux is a kind of pain while I'm driving. Isn't this supposed to be easier than not having your Alexa app?",3,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"First:  I love having Alexa onboard for when I drive.  Alex responds well for sending texts, making calls, etc.  What I don't like is 100% of Alex responses are cut off.  Alexa device never finishes a response:  it is cut off in mid-stream no matter how I try to make adjustments on the configuration.  For simple things that does not matter:  ""Alexa, play [artist name] on Amazon Music"", etc.  But when sending a text there can be multiple questions to be answered from Alexa, and if the question is cut off in mid-stream, then it can become useless.  I will be more than happy to come back and do another review once this has been fixed, but for now:  I sometimes wish that I did not purchase this device for my vehicle.  Conceptually, a great idea.  Physically:  a pain.  The only reason that I don't send it back is that I'm confident that Amazon has a fix on the way soon.",2,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0

Used the Alexa on two trips - 4 and 15 hr trips. Could not have done it with out it on the 15 hr trip driving a Uhaul truck;  the newer trucks have an auxiliary connector added to the radio only units.  I also have a blue tooth device on my 2006 Honda CRV that tuned to appropriate station will play the Alexa through its Auxiliary connector.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
Set this up between the driver and passenger seat because the provided cables weren't long enough to reach the suggested location on top of the dash or using a vent. Setup was easy and the device connected to my phone. It hears me just fine but is slower than a regular echo to pick up on the wake word.Only issue I've found is if I start playing music using Alexa and then skip a song either with my phone or car buttons then the infotainment screen does not update with the new song. Asking Alexa any command or waking her will cause it to update. If I have not skipped any songs and the song ends normally then the infotainment does update.,3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
I really like the idea that I can fully voice control my home  plus listen to music in my vehicle. I've had temporary Bluetooth connection issues  since I received my first echo auto back in February.

"So, it's an echo.  For the car.  Basically it's a microphone receiver, everything it does, it does connected to your Alexa Phone App.  I guess if your receiver is bad at Bluetooth or doesn't have any (aux cable included in package) this is a great option.

I believe they need to add more buffer (if that's what you call it) to the unit to play longer in dead spots. The sound is good but probably depends on the quality of your car stereo system.

THAT MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO THE RADIO/XM RADIO AT ALL IF YOU WANT TO USE THE DEVICE UNLESS YOU STREAM IT OVER YOUR PHONE AND USE CELLULAR DATA.  That is completely ridiculous.  I do not wish to use my data to listen to the same things I can listen to for free on my radio (am/fm stations) nor do I want to pay 20.00 more a month to use my data to stream sirius/xm radio over my phone to the bluetooth input on my head unit.  Until and unless this device can pass through the tuner from the car, it is utterly worthless IMHO.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"This new amazon auto plays the music I like, when I want it. The set up was a bit tricky at first, but follow the instructions and it will work fine. Allow the updates when you initially start and install.  This device allows me to drop my SirusXM account and now get my music in the car saving me over 150 dollars a year on the sirus subscription.  I may get multiple attachments so I can use it in my other car. Thanks Amazon.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"This actually works quite well. Sometimes it doesn’t respond as good as you would like, and not crazy about the mounting system which disables direction of air flow of one your vents. I understand why they had to design it like that and I don’t have better suggestion without sticking stuff to your dashboard. The technology is great and it definitely is cool technology.

"Wow! It is so nice having Alexa in my car! I have used Siri in my car when I have questions and Siri usually answers with “check your phone” but I am driving and I don’t want to check my phone!!  So Alexa has made it simple to ask questions and actually get answers. Alexa may not always hear when I ask a question, but when it hears me, I am very pleased with the results!

I have had the auto echo for about 2 weeks. This is our 4th echo device and our least favorite.The cords get in the way. The AC cent clip is big and once again gets in the way. I really don’t like that part at all.,3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I like this product, but it DOES have some issues right now.  It seems like approximately half the time when I ask Alexa to play music or do anything she says “I’m sorry, I’ve having issues connecting to the network right now.  Please try again later” My home Alexa devices don’t do that.  Another issue I have is that Alexa can’t lock/unlock my Smart locks.  My home Alexa devices can do this with a voice code that I set so why can’t my car Alexa?  That was actually one reason I bought this product - I was hoping when I pulled into my driveway I could say “Alexa unlock my front door” and then I could carry my groceries in.  But, all in all, this is a nice product that has most of the Alexa features.",3,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"Alexa works just like in my home.  No complaints there.The trouble is that every time I start my car I have to unplug/plug in the Auto Echo.  If I don't then Alexa says she lost connection with my iPhone/car.  It's kind of annoying, but I'm slowly remembering to just unplug the unit after/before I turn off my car to go run errands/whatever.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
I’m sadly disappointed in this device. The voice recognition is poor at best. The number of times I have to tell the device something to get it to work (if it works) varies wildly from once to over five times. Alexa’s penchant for sometimes interpreting your voice how she chooses is on overdrive here. I’m also disappointed in the power source. Running wires all over the car is ugly and cumbersome. A rechargeable device should be the next step. The sound also comes out tinny- it’s adding a step to Bluetooth connection basically by connecting your phone to the device and then the device to your car. Wait to purchase this until they make improvements to the OS and to the physical makeup of it.,2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I was very excited when I first got the Echo Auto.  I had problems initially given that I already had my Galaxy S10+ integrated with my BMW.  I did get them sorted out by watching third party youtube videos on installation. I found the Echo Auto usefulness to be very middle of the road - not great, but not bad. I really like that I'm able to ask for my audio playlists, but it doesn't work if I leave Alexa playing music at my house (I probably need a family Amazon music subscription). It doesn't handle network connectivity switchovers when I leave my house and transition from wifi to cellular. I also like that I can ask Alexa for directions, but it seems to need my phone to already have maps open.",3,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
Besides adding items to my shopping list it hasn't added a lot of value.  It doesn't understand my request for phone numbers much better than my iphone does... which is not well... I asked it to check the internet for a store that sold a particular item and it told me that it was having trouble connecting to my phone... it was already connected to my phone.  I hope someone can help me get some value out of this device.,2,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I think it's awesome. I can tell it to play music, where as without it was difficult to play specific songs.

"Alexa is a good thing and usually very helpful in making moment in life a little smoother. BUT, this Auto version has a major problem, the car stereo needs to be in BT or AUX mode to hear Alexa.

Works pretty good but with all the current features in our vehicles today it’s pretty much a waste of money. It uses the data from your wireless provider which is the same thing my smartphone does so why not just eliminate the extra device. I find using my smartphone linked to my car’s audio via Bluetooth works just fine without this device and not having a vent blocked and wires running around my dash is a plus.,2,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"There are occasional issues with voice recognition if the window is down or if you start talking before Alexa fully mutes the radio, but I guess that's my fault.

"I wanted this to work so bad, loved the idea of being able to have Alexa in the car. Fell soShort with this!! When listening to music it just stops, won’t play next song, pauses, have to keep asking to play. Better just opening app and doing it yourself. Tried in my Jeep Wrnagler JKU and Toyota 4Runner.

This is close to perfect. I love having Siri in the car. The issue is that it does not work with appleplay whatsoever. Which makes it useless if you use your cars appleplay screen for gps because it’s big and logical. I have two phones so I use one for this and one for Apple play. This lets me use the screen for gps and the other for music. Overall I am happy with it now that I have it working. The voice pickup can be hard sometimes.,4,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0

"It works, but I was disappointed to realize that it only works when my cars stereo in on Bluetooth. This keeps me from listening to the radio, a CD, satellite radio or any other connected device. It just works with my phone. Ok that’s nice, but I envisioned more flexibility. I’m sure some will say I should have expected that, but I guess I was thinking since a it’s an add on unit, it would have more built in function. My iPhone already does much of the functions through Siri, so, no big upgrade.",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"This is no where near as good as other echo devices. When it does work it’s nice but you can’t count on it. It loses connection frequently. There are also random, annoying audio warnings that interrupt what you are doing, like during trivia or other games. It might work a little better if you have an AUX connection in your vehicle so it’s not trying to pair to 2 Bluetooth connections, but who knows? It’s fun to have as a novelty to play games or stuff on commutes or long drives but you can’t rely on it for navigation or anything like that.",3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I like the portability of the device. I love taking my Alexa everywhere. I just have a few problems with it. During setup I could only use the USB option; the auxiliary version did not work for me.

Echo Auto has been a perfect solution for that.

Secondly, it doesn't consistently connect to your phone when you start the car.  Solution - unplug it and replug it in and it usually does.  It becomes unresponsive at times, after working fine for a while then stopping, requiring a reboot.  The clip you use to connect it to your vent isn't great and it falls a lot.  Overall, it's more of a hassle than any value it provides.",1,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0

"I have a 2016 Tesla Model S and prior to that a Lexus SC430 which I used the Viva Rovie in car Echo voice command. Before the Rovie I had installed a Echo Dot. Both worked ""OK"" in my Lexus.

I tried the Rovie in the Tesla but the voice commands only worked about 1/2 the time. Enter the Echo Auto...... the unit always picks up my voice and response time is very fast. Also, no third party app (not the case with the Rovie) which would get ""hung up"" and would have to re-set at times. This Echo Auto just works.......... well, so far. easy to install and setup.

Only problem is that it has to be on a dedicated channel (auxiliary), so I can't listen to the songs on my car's HD. Sure, I can stream through Alexa, but I'm not sure if that'll be eating up data (can't find an answer to that), as Echo Auto goes through my phone (so it probably is using data ...)",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

I end up either in my car restarting the echo, or on the road asking alexa for a podcast and keep getting the same response that it cannot connect. The strange thing is the bluetooth always works.

When it did work, it did everything like the echo home products.  However week five to six, there were connections problems and then the unit crapped out completely.

So far it isn’t the experience I was hoping for and not as useful as I had hoped, in its current implementation. I feel it will improve over time (at least I hope).

I originally signed up as an early adopter and subsequently received my device in late September.  After just a week or two, I started receiving warnings from AT&T on unexpected data usage.  I am currently on a limited GB plan and had consumed amounts that I never approached previously.  In examining my usage, I could see Data Usage charges (flat 135 Mb) happening multiple times an hour (some just 4 minutes apart) - tied to dates when I knew I was using the Echo Auto.  If you are on any type of limited GB cellular plan (not unlimited), THIS ITEM IS NOT FOR YOU.I just spoke to an Amazon Customer Service rep who confirmed that the consumption I experienced was as expected.  I originally thought I owned a defective model.",1,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"The vent mount bracket will not work on my vehicle in the location I want to mount the unit. My phone and the Echo unit disconnect occasionally, not sure if it is a problem with the phone or the Echo Auto? I have used it to make calls, navigate, make calls, and listen to music, it works pretty good doing these tasks. Overall I think it performs well, I haven’t had it that long, so I would like to add a update to this review at a later time.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Well, I’ve read some one-star reviews and they are well said about echo auto. For those who don’t really care so much about the details, I’d just simply tell you that the experience with Echo auto isn’t great. The connection loss is so frequent and most of the times, it didn’t  even tell you the connection was lost. It was just quiet like dead. Based on this issue, I believe everyone can imagine how other experience could go.",1,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
So this definitely works to add Alexa to your car but I’m not sure howUseful that is to anyone without a long commute. I usually ask it to play a certain son on Spotify or to look up a quick fact or weather report. I can do that just as well with Siri though. I thought it might be good for directions but it just sends a link to your phone which you have to click anyways. Not exactly a hands free experience.,3,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"Good idea but you have to leave the car connected to bluetooth audio on your phone. Doesn’t work well for listening to the radio since you have to switch back and forth from radio to bluetooth. My unit also has a VERY hard time connecting to my phone. Even with my phone connected without delay to my car, you go to ask the echo a question and all I get is an “sorry, still trying to connect to your phone”. Would be much better if you could just use the built in speaker on the unit for directions/questions etc but if you do stream music through your phone you can change to the car speaker through Bluetooth. Also, no app integration to open/close the garage door?? Amazon connects through amazon key, why can’t it be used for personal use also?  Disappointed with the product functionality.",1,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
It is nice and convenient when it works. When you have your phone plugged in to charge it is harder to use and switches from Bluetooth to iPod and it gets confused. Also if you are using the radio sometimes when you ask Alexa to something she will automatically switch to the Bluetooth connection but not most times so you have to manually switch it. Also Alexa sometimes has a very long delay in answering so you think it didn’t work and ask again and it is like it gets flustered. Overall if it worked all the time I would love it but it is frustrating when it doesn’t and unfortunately it doesn’t work more often then not 😔,3,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I love this little gadget.  I dont have a ""new"" car but it still connects via bluetooth. The sound is great.  I had some initial problems connecting it but once it was it's seamless every time.  Occasionally, she lights up but just refuses to talk to me, play music or make calls.

"I read the reviews before buying the ""echo auto""... weren't promising.  However since my car doesn't have Bluetooth I was desperate for complete ""hands-free"" help.  My echo-auto arrived and sadly I encountered the same struggles I had read.  She is a pain in the butt to set-up.... I was close to returning it.  I tried for two days, but suddenly it started working.  I discovered that Alexa is a child... A.I. needs repeated practice to learn how to function.  My point is simple: I now have complete, intelligent, hands-free connection... echo-auto requires persistence and patience, but it does work... and it works well.  Here is a tip:  Always be certain you phone is within range and ON before powering Alexa.  Alexa is not just an app.  she thinks... Hope this helps.",4,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"This is a great little tool for playing music from Spotify while I'm driving, pulling up directions, and making calls without having to remove my phone from the mount and look away from the road. Bluetooth connectivity is problem free minus maybe a couple of times in the month or so that I've owned it. Sometimes you need to turn down your music or even A/C and raise your voice for Alexa to accurately interpret your request.

I don’t know how I ever took road trips without the Echo Auto. Sometimes you just want to hear the same song a dozen times. Be aware though that when your phone is not using Wi-Fi you are eating up your Cellular data. Great having a louder voice (than on the cell’s speaker phone) to give you turn by turn directions or to make a phone call without taking your hands off the steering wheel. Another great device.,5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I purchased this product knowing it would have initial snags but it’s getting frustrating. Yes, you do have to wait for it to attach to the car every time you start the car but I can usually wait.  However, the many times it loses connection during your drive becomes annoying.I had my Apple Music open and working on the device for two days. Now it tells me to open my app on the phone to link Apple Music but no further instructions, which apparently you need because just opening the app does nothing. I’ve tried linking it various ways to no avail.  Maybe now that it’s for sale to the public they will have an online manual.",3,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"I'm happy with this when it works but it's a hassle to get it reconnected to the phone every time I get in the car. I used Bluetooth for wireless calling before I got the Echo Auto and it always connected flawless.  After installing the Echo Auto I always have to through a sequence of force stop the Alexa app on my phone, then turn off and back on the Bluetooth on my phone.  I found I could complete those steps by rebooting my phone every time I start the car.  Seems it was released without much testing.  Not sure if Amazon will send us early adopters a new version when (if?) they fix the connection issues.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"We use Alexa at home, but didn't think it would be a big deal for the car ... but it is. Because we have unlimited data, we feel free to stream whatever we want, including a favorite radio station from Boston. Alexa provides directions on my attached phone, since this is an older car (2012) that does not have its own display screen. We are going to try it next in our 2018 car that has a screen and Android Auto, to see if it integrates.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
It would be a great addition to our devices if it worked consistently. There are multiple times each week that I need to go through the setup with my phone to get it to reconnect. It asks you to go into the Alexa app but 3 out of 4 times the needed screen is not showing in the app so you have to repeatedly open and close it for it to show up so you can even try to reconnect. When it is working it adds lots of functionality to my older car but unfortunately the amount of errors takes away from the experience.,2,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I read a lot and like audio books for my drive to and from work.  Now with amazon auto, I can listen to books, even those that I don't have audio books if they are text to speech enabled.  As for interacting with my android phone, it could be a lot better.  Alexa has a long way to go to interact with the phone better than Google.  But if the goal is for entertainment reasons (books and music), Alexa does this very well.",3,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"It took me about maybe 29 to 30 minutes to figure out how to connect this to my car because I had a new installed bluetooth stereo with different app and functions added to my car. But once I had it to work it was easy. The kids love it. Its very helpful on many ways like asking questions for about almost everything, asking alexa to make calls or navigation and etc and it helps that I can remove it and keep it safe when I have the car parked",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Easy setup as long as you are already connected to with Bluetooth to your car for both Audio and Calls. I have not used the stereo aux connection. Also make sure you say yes to all the permissions on your phone for it to work correctly.  Make sure you have dropins allowed in your Alexa app. I have a Note9 and have made calls from my contacts, send text messages, dropped into my kitchen, played audiobook rewind, fast forward, pause, Pandora, read out text messages, navigated that brings up Google maps.  Only thing I don't like is the slight delay in time when you say Alexa. I think it cuts off the first part of your request if you don't wait for the tone.  Did all the above handsfree.  I got this mostly for a long road trip where the kids can use Alexa as a DJ like they do at home.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"ECHO AUTO started out great. Loved that I could be hands free with my cell phone, listen to my music and audible books on amazon prime.  Then one day Alexa started saying ""connection to phone lost"" every few days then ALL the time!  Tried unplugging and restarting several times.  Tried powering off my phone and restarting several times.  Frustrated and fed up I brought the echo auto into the house and haven't bothered to try again.",2,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
I liked the Echo Auto so much I purchased a second one for my wife's car.  The only frustrating thing is that the second Echo Auto came with a completely different mount.  The original included a simple plate that I could mount on the steering wheel column (this worked great).  The second came with a heater vent mount that is not going to work out.  As both cars are identical besides the color I prefer the original mount and do not see them for sale on amazon.  Looks like I'll need to invest in a strip of velcro.  :),4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0

I constantly have to unplug it to reset it. It randomly just cuts out and stops playing. And my phone calls sometimes pick up on it, and sometimes they don't.It is not easy to switch your phone calls over while you are driving - it defeats the entire purpose of hands free.

"I thought it would be cool to have Alexa in the car but found I didnt find a use for it. Your mileage may vary but in my car the only way to ""hear"" Alexa is to have my radio set on media. If it's set on media, then I can't listen to my satellite radio or regular radio, which is what I chiefly do. I was uninterested in swapping back and forth when I wanted to talk to Alexa so just wasn't a winner for me. Ended up giving it away to my kid.",2,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0

But when playing music the Alexa voice is way too high whereas the music which plays directly afterwards is great.

"I found that this product did not work well for me. The first issue is that it often simply doesn't work and I would have to reset the echo. Second, I found that I just prefer to use the Alexa feature for my Amazon music app and Audible app through my phone rather than the Echo Auto, which half the time didn't play what I asked it to play. Third, the mount was odd and the wires were annoying -I'm not sure why this can't go through my Bluetooth?

"I love the feature and option in my car, the handsfree options are great. The texting feature is often annoying because it repeats things too much. Often times it asks ""what's the message"" then I say the message and it includes the word ""message"" in the beginning of my message. Occasionally it will ask ""did you mean Mickey Mouse"" and when I say yes it will respond ""I don't see a Mickey Mouse"" in your contacts, so there are definitely some bugs to be worked out but overall I love it for controlling my audio books, music/pandora, getting driving directions verbally, texting, etc.",3,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0

As I was laying in bed watching porn I noticed the sound wasn’t coming on so naturally the first thing I did was turn the volume higher only to hear moans coming from my driveway at full blast. It was only later that I leaned that if you have a newer car and leave this plugged in it will not turn off and there is no easy ON/OFF switch to toggle.

"It kind of works when you have a strong cell signal, although it seems less smart than the home version. I have an iPhone, and a car with carplay, so I had almost all driving functions covered, but in the recent past Siri was not connected to Spotify, so I had no hand-free way to request music on my favorite music service. The Echo Auto was pretty good for asking to play music on non-apple music services like Spotify. BUT then Apple shipped iOS 13 and opened Siri up to 3rd party apps. Requesting Spotify music with the ""Siri"" button on the steering wheel now works flawlessly!  So sadly, now there isn't much reason for me to use Echo Auto.",3,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0

I've had issues getting it to start the Amazon Music app - dead air when I ask for a playlist to start.  If I go into the Amazon Music app through the CarPlay app, music starts, then I can use the Echo Auto to skip, change playlists, etc.  I just can't start playing music just through the Echo Auto.

If you have bluetooth in your car set to your phone it will interupt the phones connection  with audiobooks , not actual phone calls.  But then, you could just have Alexa read your audiobook.

"The Echo Auto works pretty well. I don't have a bluetooth stereo in my car so I use the included Aux cable and can now make or receive phone calls and play my favorite songs with a simple voice command and the sound plays on the car speakers. Another perk is that I can control my Smart-home devices from inside my car even when I'm several miles away from home.The only problems I've had so far is when I'm a not quite far enough away from my home wifi router to connect to the cellular network only. When this happens, it'll usually tell me it can't connect to the network. Also, a couple of times,  I have been listening to music and received a phone call and told Alexa to hang up and then resume music but the music didn't resume. I once closed the app on my phone and restarted it and it worked and the second time this didn't work. Not sure how to fix this yet. Other than that there have been no problems.

The echo auto, I assume, is no different. After having it for one day, I wanted to send it back. Then I left it plugged in and just used my phone for a few days. Now it’s performing great. It powers on and links up almost instantly.Having said that, I do have an issue with the fact that it only links through my phone.

Kinda a pain because you want to get into your car and go and it’s not the case with this device. If it doesn’t easily connect, I’m having to pull over and go on my phone to figure it out or I just give up because I have to be somewhere and don’t have the time to deal with it.

"I like having my Alexa devices at home although the AI interface is not very mature and seemingly simple commands or questions are more often than not responded with, 'I'm sorry, I don't know that'.  Attempting to play an Amazon Music playlist by voice command is challenging as she often misinterprets what you're asking and plays something else.  Then there's the issue of the music just suddenly stopping for no reason.  No voice commands, no reminders, just stops.Still there was some value and fun with having the Alexa that I liked the idea of having it in my car so I could add to shopping lists, set reminders, calendar items, etc., as I often remember those while in my car.  I also like to play Amazon Music in the car.  For the most part, Alex Auto does an adequate job of this, but the same questions for the AI still cause problems, and the car version just shuts down periodically altogether.",3,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
I was on the invite list for this and I was super excited about it. When it came in it was easy to set up and it doesn’t look too bad in the car. Why is it wired? In this day and age can’t it be run off of a battery so that it integrates cleaner in your car? Also it rarely connects when I asks it to. I have to go in and manually connect it to my iPhone. It often says it has connectivity issues and it rarely understands what I am saying.

The only real hassle is that it seems to lose the connection to my phone or to ""the network"" far more often than I would like.  No rhyme or reason to it.  I can go into the office for the whole day, come back out and everything connects perfectly.  Next time I'm in the house for 2 hours and I have to unplug the Echo and plug it back in just to get it to re-set.One thing I wish it had... I wish you would add a button to the top that would allow you to advance songs or go back by touch instead of voice.  I have a convertible, so when the top is down it's obviously tough for Alexa to hear me.  So the button would be good in those limited situations.  THANK YOU!",4,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"What they forget to tell you is that settings on your phone may interfere with setup.  I tried for 3 days off and on before I was able to connect.I did find out because my car has bluetooth enabled, I don’t need aux cable, not both.",4,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Having Alexa in your car is very convenient, but it still needs work. Some functions that you may be used to in Android Auto or Apple CarPlay is still a work in progress with Alexa. Asking it to do the most basic things is a breeze (like play music), but searching for things still needs imporovement. If your car doesn't have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, having this Alexa device is a goo substitute, especailly as new imrpovements are added.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

Would not work in my 2018 Ram. I  kept getting errors on install asking to install new software.  I Installed successfully  on my Wife's 2012 Hyundai Elantra. Since I used my wife's account( who is part of my amazon household) I am not able to access my amazon prime music playlists or control my WEMO switches. I later  found out that Family share only works on unlimited planI guess I everything would have worked if I used my account but I don't want to waste any more time on reinstalling and I can't find any good instructions on this. Amazon should address some of the issues like two phones and two users in a family car,2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
As an Alexa user you can control all of your smart home devices from your car.  We just need the Knight rider Kit voice to take this over the top.  But seriously you open your garage door if you have an Alex enabled garage door opener.  Turn the lights on etc...  from a car perspective the Amazon music radio is amazing and for the first time I questioned the need for satellite radio if it wasn't for Kids place live.  I also love the Audible integration much nicer and safer to say Alexa play my audio book then to fuss around with the phone.  This alone makes it a must have for Audio book users.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"Works as described - gives me hands free in my 2000 Villager -***update*** I still love it!  I have a 1994 truck with a radio with a broken auxiliary plug - but I was able to add a little bluetooth/wired speaker to my alexa auto, and get tunes back in my truck, plus all the other benefits of alexa without going through the radio. So just because you don't have a state of the art car, this will still work for you.",5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
I love the echo in my home so I jumped on the chance for this. I have been disappointed by what I got. It is always in the way and does not mount anywhere in my car. Half the time it freezes up or plays the wrong thing. It can't recognize higher pitched voices and beeps way too much! I keep it unplugged most of the time because of the beeping. I thought it would replace XM for me but now I see that will never happen.,1,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"EcoAuto connects to my car via Bluetooth. The sound quality is excellent. The eco works just as good in my car as the home version. It was easy to set up.

Constantly disconnects and takes a long time to function once the car starts. Having to go to the Alexa app all the time to reconnect sucks. I loved it when it was actually working but that's been so infrequent.

"It wouldn't connect to my car (Alfa Romero).  Never got it to work.Didn't like the initial setup procedure.  It felt clunky and over burdened.

"Works well, but in my Toyota Camry, the audio has feedback from the engine when using the aux audio port.  Not necessarily a problem with the Amazon Auto, but would be nice if it had audio filter built in.  This is a common issue with aux inputs in cars so it is resolved with an inline filter, but cumbersome to have a second device required for clear audio.  Would like to see the unit have this built in.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0

"Handy little gadget! I've been using it for several months now. I love that I can do everything while hands free. Play my favorite songs, add to my grocery list, text hands free, and even get directions.

"I've enjoyed my echo auto for listening to pandora. It keeps me from always looking at my phone to change the song. My car is a 2013 so I have to use a cord to plug it into the auxiliary. I'll say that's the thing I dislike the most. I haven't figured out how to make it all look tidy. The mount does hog up my air vent but that hasn't been an issue as I have it mounted on the passenger side of the car. One bonus...I don't have to have my phone plugged into the auxiliary so it can be charging. The connection is pretty good but, like most other things including Sirius XM, it all depends on the location and clouds.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Setup was easy, the device works as advertised.  The only complaint is not about the device but about the Bluetooth interface.  I own a new(er) Sabaru and to use Alexa requires two finger taps on the cars info panel to go from the home, phone or radio screen to the Bluetooth screen.  Somewhat annoying and distracting to do while driving. The other is Alexa depends on a cellphone connection to work - in hilly areas where I live, that can be a problem.  None of this is a gadget fault but you need to take into consideration.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"The only way for me to use this is to connect to my phone via bluetooth, select bluetooth as my output, and that's how it functions.  You can't just plug it in, and while listening to your radio, suddenly say ""Alexa, add tacos to my shopping list.""  It depends solely on your battery power and your wi-fi.I wish I had never purchased this (even at the 1/2 price promotion).  It is 100% USELESS.",1,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"I have had nothing but problems with this in my Subaru.

"I use it to listen to AM radio which has a better sound quality then my car radio (no static or fading like AM usually does when driving). I can say Alexa play 710AM and it plays it via iHeartRadio. Does great sending text messages from my phone contacts, it verifies the person you are sending the text to by saying “Did you mean (contact name)?” then ask for the message and repeats the message and then you can tell it to send, it sends the text along with a link the recipient can click on to hear the message in my own voice. It does seem to have an issue with its awake word, I have to say it loud, but once it is listening I can talk in my normal voice.",4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0

If you’re thinking it just speak it aloud and Alexa will respond(just remember to use the wake word first) I have had echo auto in my car since August. My two dislikes are the cables and that once connection Is lost (which it can do often depending on what area you’re in) it has a hard time getting back on track and you will have to manually do it.Overall echo auto is amazing.

I have it plugged into a USB port that shuts off with the car and the echo starts right back up every time with no problems (it will wear on the car battery if you have it plugged into an always hot port). Responds quickly and accurately with great voice recognition abilities; it can hear me even when my radio is turned up very loud. Makes phone calls, reads and sends texts flawlessly. Really, really happy with this.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"Would frequently recognize my voice but after giving a command, the light turned off and nothing happened. I'd have to repeat myself multiple times until it finally did the command given. For $50, it's not worth it for your car! Most phones have a similar command (Ok Google, Hey Siri, etc) so unless you're dying to integrate Alexa with your car and can't use your phone, then get it.

"My car doesn’t have Bluetooth.  When this works, it works well (except calling).  Two big complaints: (1) connecting to the Alexa network (not Bluetooth - the actual Alexa system) is horrible.  My phone connects right away, but it can take several minutes for the network to connect.  (2) incoming call quality is fine, but those on the receiving end tell me the sound quality is awful - like you’re talking in a tunnel.",2,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"This is a nice idea. But it's constantly disconnecting from my phone and saying it's trying to connect, even though I have the Alexa app open on my phone and my phone says it is connected via bluetooth.The other big problem is that you can't listen to the car radio or use CarPlay and access this at the same time. I use both a lot, including for navigation. So that's a problem. Better to just use the Alexa app on my phone.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I was suspicious of this project, but if you like music or audio books during your travels, this device taps into your Amazon Music account via your phone and allows you to listen to your playlists, etc.  It also allows you to ask Alexa to place calls.  One nifty thing I discovered is that you can route your iTunes music through here too.  Since getting the iPhone 7, I have missed not having an aux output.  This helped!",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
I am a huge fan of Amazon and Alexa so I thought this would be a no brainer! I actually just threw it in the garbage after a couple months. My biggest gripe is that you have to have the Alexa app open on your phone to use this device. I don’t like to keep apps open on my phone which makes this product useless. I also hate the wires that are needed to plug it in. This is just a lousy product plain and simple.,1,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"I also found it hard to begin but finally found echo auto in the Alexa app under echo category. Once it’s set up you don’t have to go to the app to use but the phone does have to be present, on, and connected to internet. I just say Alexa (what I want) and she works. My family van is older so love this cuz I’m using line in on radio. Also i use for phone calls as a hands free feature so I don’t get in trouble using phone in the car. Love it.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"My car is an older model that only Bluetooths my phone, nothing else from my phone. This means that in order to use Alexa I must use my aux import exclusively. This means I cannot listen to my Satellite radio and use Alexa simultaneously. Here’s the weird thing though, Alexa highjacks the audio from my directions on Apple maps or Google maps! It was frustrating in real time during recent travel. She was handy when we passed a sign for the birthplace of Davy Crockett and we couldn’t remember all the lines to “The Ballad of Davy Crockett!”  All in all I’m happy to have Alexa when I need it.",4,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

My favorite question is: Alexa- where am I? She always knows! I play song quiz and price it right when I’m stuck in traffic. I also use it to start turning my home lights on while I’m driving home from work. It works in sync with my home Alexa. I gave it 4 stars because sometimes it takes repeating myself a couple of times to make her understand what I want or what I’m asking. All and all- I love it.,4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0

The only way to re-sync is to forget the device a start the pairing process all over again. Thankfully that part is super easy and takes less than a minute, but still a pain in the butt.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0

My wife started having problems by day 2 and I was hoping it was just hers - but when mine arrived it was even worse.  When they work, they are great...but most of the time all Alexa tells us is she cannot connect to our phones and/or Alexa app and does nothing. If I unplug/re-plug it several times then it might connect - but still not a great way to get it going (especially while driving). My wife is having same problems and we both have newer iPhones (8/X) and have no issues with other devices.

"I didn't like that you have to reset all contacts when using an Android. Google knows my contacts, but Alexa needs everything imported and to learn everything. When I asked for traffic conditions home, it never did figure out where I am and insisted that my 45 minute drive would take 45 hours. The sound through my car speakers did not sound good either. Had to turn volume way up to hear a song, bit received a call at same time and it scared the poop out of me. The car next to me thought I had honked at him it was so loud! But, never could get music loud enough. I did have to buy a wifi car plug just to get it to work since I don't have the auxiliary plug.

We are a hands-free driving state so I primarily use it to play my music playlists and audible books. I have also used it to get directions. I'm still testing that out. It's also another way of getting to do reminders while I'm out. I can see myself using it a lot. For the most part my commands can be heard. Once in a while I have to repeat a command because I didn't receive any response the first time.  All in all I've found it very useful. The size is also compact so it can be out in the open but not seen. I got it on sale for $29.99. For me it was a worthwhile purchase and I'm very happy with it.,5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"I love my Alexa and my echo in my home, use them all the time. I spend 80 min a day in my car so thought maybe this would add a little bit of fun to my commute. First of all the set up is not easy and the instructions are worth less. I really don’t like the vent mount, it is very large and takes up an entire vent and makes it useless. Also the little gadget that keeps the cord organized fell off the first afternoon I used it. It plugs into the cigarette lighter which is fine, but it would be nice if it could plug into the USB or have a USB port on the cigarette charger. So there’s some just basic design faults.Then there’s the fact that it doesn’t work, not at all. If you say something do it or try to ply a game there’s a delay so you can’t even hear it. Then when you ask for directions it asks you to get out your phone and verify the address. Isn’t the point supposed to be that it’s hands free. I just don’t know what this does that the Bluetooth in my car can’t handle. I’m glad I got this at a discounted price because it wasn’t worth that price let alone the 50 dollar price",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

I have a standard plug in my car and own 2 echo dots which i can effectively take with me just as easily with more freedom and it does NOT require my phone to use it, and it really isn't that much larger....

I often have to wake her up twice before she responds.  Can’t get her integrated with Waze, which limits her usefulness to me in the car. .

You have to make sure the app is off when you get in the car, make sure you connect your phones bluetooth to the Echo Auto, then launch the app.  You also have to wait until the disclaimer pops up that says ""You are a passenger"". I understand why they do that, but if that disclaimer doesn't pop up the Echo Auto will not connect. Lots of steps, but I have an older vehicle with no Sirius, so this is perfect for music and now that I have it figured out, it's pretty easy.

My car's bluetooth doesn't support full-sync (just telephone) so I have always connected my phone to the entertainment system via 3.5mm aux in and use Alexa off the phone (although this sometimes requires tapping the screen to wake it up).  I thought the Echo Auto would be perfect to add this functionality to the car.  Unfortunately the 3.5mm aux method of connecting has terrible sound quality (very low volume unless turned up very high) and static.  I have not tested as a full bluetooth connection.  Also although compact the device itself doesn't lend itself to discreetly being able to be hidden in the car as needs to be mounted somewhere (or mounted on vent fins with included adapter), however there's no hiding its an add-on.  In the end I found it more convenient (and aesthetically pleasing) to just continue to use the Alexa App on my phone with the car.  I'm going to use the Echo Auto on my boat, which I think will work better.",2,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"This is an impressive first step, and is the best of the after market standalone units out there as of 01/2020. But it is crazy that you can’t change the wake word like other Amazon made devices. It sucks to have inconsistency between my devices. Also, the phone call support is a but weird how it does the call through at times. Sometimes the status light after a call doesn’t change from green. Ideally I wish it didn’t use the Alexa calling feature and only used my phone for the call and its own array mic for the Mic. I think that might be better.Hopefully a software update will fix the wake word change ability. As for the other phone call methods, I suspect they won’t change that due to iOS’s Bluetooth / security limits.  That and it would allow you to potentially avoid sharing contacts with Amazon.

I would have liked for this device to call or text anyone in my contacts with a simple verbal command. It doesn’t. That’s disappointing. When it works as it should, it’s a decent tool.

I bought this right out of the gate thinking it would be so easy to use in my car and it’s really been a struggle. I have one older car and one new lease vehicle.

"How well the Echo Auto functions is necessarily going to be dependent on the phone it connects through to the vehicle.  Also relevant, of course, is how the vehicle connects to the phone.

Especially useful has been the ability to ""drop in"" (or even ""announce"") on all of my Echo Devices at home.

After reading all the reviews I was hesitant to buy the Echo Auto. Seems so many have had problems with the setup. After connecting the cords and getting the orange line.. I thought cool!! This is going great!! I found My Alexa app didn’t recognize the device. So after researching YouTube.. (found all kinds of setup videos). Not one video included the fact that you need to go into your phones ( iPhone ) Bluetooth settings and connect it like you would any device. Once that is completed my Alexa app recognized the echo auto and the setup was very simple. I’ve been using the echo auto for over 3 months  and I’ve not had one problem. Just make sure your echo auto is connected to your phone via Bluetooth and your set! I drive an older Subaru and don’t have a fancy audio system. So the Echo Auto has been fabulous for me.

The set up is super easy and she does everything your home echos do.  The only problem I have encountered is that when I take a phone call via my car's integrated Bluetooth phone system, the Echo tries to take over and my call switches a few times leaving some blank spots in the conversation.  I get around this by switching my phone off the music Bluetooth section before I make a call, but it doesn't help when I get an incoming call.  My guess is that this will be fixed in future Echo updates.

Siri on my iPhone takes over my audio system (Honda CRV) when I use it, and when I'm done with Siri, the car's input automatically goes back to the XM radio settings. Amazon should just make an ""Alexa"" app that functions off of a cell phone like iPhone's Siri.

I was one of the first user of this product.  I have procrastinated on writing this review. I’m very unhappy with it. It’s complicated to set up.

"This is a good idea, but its far from adoptable technology because of its flaws. The air vent mount held the device at a weird angle, the cord is impossible to cleanly keep tucked away (it has a hard connection straight out of the side, nothing low profile or attractive) and the integration to the car's audio is just clunky. It has to be connected via bluetooth or aux cord - which is fine if I dont want to use SiriusXM or the regular radio and use the device at the same time. When I do use the device, my car switches to the bluetooth audio input (late, delayed) and then doesnt switch back to what I was previously listening to. Maybe my fault for having an incompatible car, but I think my Toyota Corolla is fairly common and should be a good baseline for use-cases to make sure it works well. I dont use it, it went into a drawer of failed electronics I adopted too early. The alexa is considerably slower than any other device I own.",2,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0

It would give you some error, ""Can't connect to Spotify on that device"" or something like that. this means that the Alexa wasn't hands free which was the reason I got it and others as well. So, they finally updated the Alexa auto address this issue and you can now control your music hands free. I have not tried other music apps but I know for sure that Spotify works great. Glad they took our reviews and fixed this issue. Other than that it is a really good product that I now am able to use since I no longer have to look down at my phone to change music while driving.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I am never able to reconnect to the Alexa app whenever I get back in my car.  The only thing that has fixed this is resetting and syncing with my phone again.  So this device is completely useless because I do not have time, nor do I want to, go through the setup every time I get in my car.I will say it does what it is supposed to do when I am connected but having to go through the setup every time I get back in my car defeats the purpose of having this.",1,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"Overall, I use it during my daily commute and it's 75% reliable in the roughly 4-5 months I believe I've had it. I'm able to use it in conjunction with multiple apps on my phone running like Waze, Spotify as well as my Samsung Galaxy Smart Watch fully functioning.My only consistent issues arise when I go through a coverage dead zone. I'll have a 5 minute segment end in the middle of this dead zone and then the Echo Auto will fail to acknowledge voice commands properly after I've gotten coverage again. Essentially, the first tone and blue light trigger and then the acknowledgement tone will fail. The only way to remedy this is to do a hard reset on the unit and hope for the best (sometimes the hard reset itself doesn't work).",3,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0

"I like that it mutes the radio to give directions. Same with an incoming phone call. But, when the phone call comes in, it might blow up your speakers. There doesn't seem to be any correlation between your radio volume and the call volume. Had issues setting up, but played around till I figured out what would work. Having my phone set to Bluetooth and linked to both my car and Alexa Auto did not get the sound to my radio. I had to add the single lead between the radio and the Alexa Auto. Then Alexa said that I didn't need that cord. But it wouldn't work without it. I don't like that when a message arrives, it just beeps. Why not state 'message arrived'. It just changes the color of the light on the Alexa to indicate something happened. And it beeps. You then have to guess what was received. Was it a notification? A message? ...",3,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"So far so good.  I got this as a gift and have been using it for about a week.  I love the ability to pick out what music I want to listen to.

"Does not always connect to BlueTooth and if used on your car stereo, it has to be on Aux., then you can't use your CD or Ipod or FM radio.  If so, you won't hear the sound from the phone.  Alexa does not understand half of what you say.  Any of these Alexa products are not worth having.  I have the Echo, Echo Show and Echo Audio and the only thing about the Show is that it makes a great alarm clock.

I do use google on my phone though to make calls and voice text, so you can easily forget who your talking to Alexa oops no Google.

"It's great to have Alexa in the car with me, but I wish I could just leave it plugged in to charge. The cord is definitely an eye sore. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars, though, is because this device wakes up if Alexa is said on the radio (if the audio is streaming from the alexa device). A little annoying but no biggie.

After you pair one time, whether or not you are connected to the auto, even when you are not near your car, when you are on a call Alexa interrupts the call talking over the call saying ""To unmute your call use your car's stereo system.""  It does this repeatedly.  Search online there is tons of complaints with no resolution. Too bad, good idea but this issue is super intrusive.",4,1,2019-10-7,1,1,0
My ins company sent this to me free. I have Ford Sync in my '13 Escape and the Alexa Auto conflicts with it. I got it to function but it keeps the phone app on all the time sucking batt.

It would be nice if it worked directly with navigation software like Waze, Apple Maps or Google Maps. On occasion I had to open the Alexa app on my iPhone to force it to connect. Overall a great start and with a few more skills I would give this five stars.

I went through the instructions several times but could not get this to work. It showed up as connected in my Samsung Galaxy S8 (which easily uses Bluetooth to my car's stereo) but I kept getting the messages that it had been disconnected.

"I love Alexa and was really excited to get Echo Auto.  Sadly, it’s not ready for Prime time. It will not access XM/Sirius account. I need my radio more than I need Alexa. I don’t understand why other Echo products work with XM, but Auto fails.  I then asked Alexa to play Amazon music, and it did so, but I had to choose to stop playing Alexa on a device in my home.  It should not be an either or situation. I play Alexa in two different rooms in my house without issue. I disconnected Alexa from the car and found that I had lost my XM signal. Too many issues.  Hopefully, Amazon can get these corrected.  Until then, save your money",1,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"So it's great to have Alexa in the car. My two minor complaints are that it seems every time it goes a long time between use, I have to open the app on my phone to reconnect, as it's lost it's connection to the app. Also, the delay for Alexa to hear instructions versus the immediate receipt in the house is annoying to get used to. Maybe that changes as it gets to know me more. When you wake her up, there's a few second delay before the beep, so I always find myself having to say everything twice. Other than those two things, it connects through my bluetooth well and plays over my radio speakers. The sound quality of Alexa herself is very poor, with hissing for some reason, but the music and talking from what I connect to sounds fine. Not sure why that is, but not a big deal.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Great idea, but needs work. It worked great in the beginning and then it started losing connection with the Alexa app. Now I can't even use it at all because it continuously causes the Alexa app to force close. I know it's not the app that's the problem because when I unplug the echo auto the app works just fine. Without a connection to the app this thing is useless. I hate I spent $25 on it and I feel sorry for anyone who pays the full price of $50 because it's not worth it at all.",1,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
Doesn't stay connected.  Its only good to play music and to ask to turn the lights on (in your house) before you shut the car off.  The call's don't work great if your contacts aren't in Alexa.  Looks kinda cool but you get over it quick.  PLUS the rubber wire holder doesn't stick; falls off all the time and just hangs there.  Not worth it right now - if it has more features for the car I'll set it back up.,1,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"The product is clearly still in beta testing, it works well...when it works. Alexa frequently stops listening or doesn’t take requests like the home platforms (potentially due to noise or third party connection) but all the same it’s more frustrating than helpful. Bought this because I have five alexa products at home that I love and wanted to the freedom of hands free song changing in my truck, however more often than not it simply does not perform.

I can ask to change XM channels and it usually takes at least 2 minutes for it to happen, even with full signal strength on my Verizon iPhone 11. Often, she locks up and the blue bar lights up but then nothing happens and it goes off. When the music is playing she hears me but gets the instructions wrong. I’ve found myself raising my voice at it. It’s way more frustrating than I had anticipated. I love my dot. This...you should pass.

This supplies that flawlessly, with no setup involved! Just asked Alexa to make a call from my contact list and it did it flawlessly. Also allows me to play Amazon music through my car stereo without having to plug my phone into the aux jack as the echo auto already does that. The microphones pick up my commands easily.

Very handy to have in a car especially for younger drivers who like to text and drive. My husband loved the echo once he installed it in my jeep so I had to buy him one.

It doesn't understand what I'm saying quite often and I don't have an accent or anything.  The Echo in my home always understands. It's just frustrating most of the time. Yesterday I reached my limits with this thing and ripped the wires out of it and threw it on the passenger side floor, had my windows been open I would have seriously considered throwing it out the window, but it was hot out. Amazon should really fix all the bugs and send out an update, or just a new product all together.",1,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"I was wondering what I needed this for in my car, but at the Deal pricing I had not much to lose by trying it.  It took awhile to connect because my 2013 Muranao did not have the input plug needed to integrate with the soundsystem so I had to hit the store to buy a connection adapter (the old red yellow white rca inputs) but then it worked fine (as long as I remember to have the Alexa app running on my iPhone).  Now I can listen to podcasts etc and stream music without paying Sirius.",4,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"My biggest problem with the device is that it had to go through my phone's bluetooth to connect to my car stereo. I wanted a device that was connected via bluetooth on it's own.

It’s supposed to be able to hear your voice commands over music and other noises, but often I have to turn the volume of the radio down significantly as well as the heating and cooling in order for Alexa to hear me. There are times when Alexa is not able to play a requested song or it cannot understand what was said to it. I often use Siri to get what I want. Now please don’t get me wrong, there have been many times when Echo Auto has worked perfectly. It really just depends on what you want to use. I actually don’t use it as much as I thought I would.",3,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0

"Long story short - all this was (for my car) was a glorified microphone.  Just using my phone's bluetooth to my car's stereo system was far easier.  The Alexa for auto OFTEN directs me to the WRONG podcast.  When I asked for technical support, I found that the techs really didn't know much about how this works with autos.  Bottom line - save your $ and just use your phone's bluetooth into your car's stereo and buy an echo for your home instead.",1,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

"I enjoy my Echo Auto and tend to use it more on longer drives than routine daily ones.  My install and setup was more difficult and confusing than it needed to be.  The biggest issue for me was whether to go with wired or wireless connection.  Unfortunately, these was no real explanation of the pros/cons of one vs the other.  After choosing wireless initially, it was difficult to then change to wired.

"I always listen to audiobooks on an MP3 player - using a 3.5 mm input - when I drive. But when the audiobook ends while driving, or I just want to hear music I love and I don't like my choice of radio stations (even with Sirius), I just ask Alexa to play my choice of music. If my audiobook is from Audible, I have Alexa play that while I drive so I am not fiddling with an MP3 player.

Bluetooth connection to the phone failed once in two months of twice daily use. The integration with Ford’s older Sony SYNC is very spotty and annoying. I blame Ford&Sony.

I really like my Echo Auto. It does nearly everything I want in a device of this type.  I'm still waiting on turn by turn navigation.  I don't want it to just turn on maps on my phone.  And the mount is garbage.  I purchased velcro and stuck it under the overhang of my dash right over my speedo.

It records your voice and sends a link to the voice recording along with the transcribed text. I really hate that idea and cannot find anyway to disable it, so the feature is essentially not what I wanted it for.  Also, alexa app has trouble connecting and I have to reboot my phone usually on startup of the echo.  (I have a pixel 3, not outdated phone by any means).",3,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
I love the idea of this product but......why all the cords? It is wonderful when it works. I can listen to all of my favorite songs for about 30 min. then it glitches out or will not respond and I’m left shouting ALEXA! Sometimes it makes me set it up all over again which is frustrating.

"I wanted to love this, in fact my family bought two. It just doesn’t work correctly. The biggest problem is that it doesn’t reconnect as it should.

Secondly, Alexa just doesn’t recognize speech as well as she does at home. I’ve resorted to just using my radio as usual and unless something is fixed, I’ll never use this device again",2,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
This is a worthless product. It is not the easiest thing to setup. I am using a Samsung S8 Android phone.

"I have been using Echo Auto for some time now. The product does work better than just using the bluetooth in my phone. The sound quality is superior to bluetooth alone and that means the world to me. The mics hear much better and understand my requests 100% better than when not using the device. I was able to follow the simple installation instructions and everything synced the first try. THAT SAID... now my radio wont play on it's own. Even when I completely remove the Echo Auto my car is synced to Alexa via my home WiFi and will not function until I am a remarkable distance from my home, about 2 miles. I believe it continues to search for a signal and locks the bluetooth in favor of the device rather than accepting my manual input? Anyway, it works well but even my mechanic can't explain why it has seemingly hijacked my vehicles entertainment system.  When can I try Amazon Loop? Very interested in how that will work.",3,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

I have to remember to turn up the volume on my phone if I have silenced it. I had no problems connecting everything in my car. It even consistently connects everytime I start my car. I had an older iPod that I previously used for music in my car and it was never connecting consistently and often I had to uninstall and pair it each time I started my car.

First the set up is not as straightforward as the instructions state. It took me 3 hours or more to achieve the Bluetooth connection to my vehicle. Once it was connected the sound quality was really good, Echo Auto performed just like my other Echo devices. However when I returned to my vehicle I had to go through the complete set up procedure again. Today, when I got into my vehicle Echo Auto would not connect to my Bluetooth, despite the device registering as ""connected"" in my settings, and showing my phone was connected in the Echo Auto FOR9 device settings.

I also have a watch connected and it will cut that off. Then it will come back on and everything works fine for another few minutes and it happens again.

You cannot blame the device for not being responsive when your phone doesn’t have reception. Use common sense people. Your vehicle is moving therefore you may or may not lose reception at the moment you make a request to Alexa.I park my car underground and of course I have to wait until I’m on the road to get reception and for Alexa to respond.

I can control music, make phone calls, get directions, get answers to basic questions (that’s all devices not just the auto), control my thermostat and lights, etc. Too bad it’s hit or miss. I really wanted to like this product.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
I love this thing. Doesn’t work great with the 2015 Jeep vents but o knew that from the get go and crafted a dash mount with the Amazon one. I use it every day! Pair with amazon music and Apple Music it’s a must have!!!,5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"I am unable to use it in India, as Amazon has evidently restricted the product geographically. The idea is good - indeed great. So much so that I went ahead and ordered it from the USA. However, the Alexa App in India does not give me a chance to add the device when I try to do so.I will revise this review if and when it starts working here.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
Let me start by saying that I love it and it does make my driving easier. Than let me say at times it frustrates me. I have 1 and only 1 complaint; the blue tooth. Alexa tells me that she is not connected to my phone when it is. My phone will show it connected and the app is running. I have to reboot Alexa when this happens. It does not happen all the time but it does happen a few times a day. More so than not. I'm hopping it will be corrected in a upcoming software update.,3,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"What's not to love about another Amazon product!!  I got myself that Auto Echo for my birthday.  I commute 30 miles for work and I'm really enjoying requesting my playlists and able to pause in the middle a song to take a phone call,  Add items to My Shopping List or Christmas list. My only complaint was I purchased this for full price and 2 days later it it was advertised $10 cheaper",5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"I have recently installed Echo Auto and definitely like being able to stream music, plus have the use of Alexa in my car. It did take a while to get the device to connect. I use the plug-ins for the cigarette lighters as my power source (yes, my car is THAT old :-) ) and had to gather up one of the wires so it wouldn't interfere with the gear shift. Every time  I use Auto Echo I use my phone to log on to the Alexa app; to connect bluetooth  my car has to be far enough away from my home so it wouldn't keep connecting to my home's WIFI  Once everything is up and running I'm good to go.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"love this little gadget, my cars Bluetooth doesn't work, so this was the best thing. Hands free calls and texts. The only thing is that whoever you're calling will hear a lot of feedback so I wish that that was fixed. I ask if its going to rain if I think about leaving my windows cracked, it will play your music and podcasts, picks up right where I left off on Spotify.I've read Alexa will also give you directions, but I don't think I'm asking the correct way.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"I can't say with 100% certainty that the problem is with the echo vs my cell service, but more often than not I will speak, it will think for a while, and then nothing will happen.  Sometimes I will have to ask it the same thing 4 or 5 times in a row before it ever actually responds.  One of my favorite things about my home echos is that I can get an instant answer to all sorts of questions, but that certainly isn't the case with this and it can get very frustrating.",2,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

I was so very excited to bring it to my vehicle for ease of use and everything else Alexa had to offer.I was wrong.  Echo auto doesn’t connect well, struggles to keep a good connection with my phone and or stereo system, and when I went to troubleshoot, took forever to reconnect.  I had to forget the device and reconnect.  After less than a day’s use of driving around town and running errands, same issues came right back.  Don’t bother with this.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

"Love having Alexa on the go. Into anyone having “trouble connecting to the network right now” its a problem with the strength of your data on your phone.

She is an awesome traveling companion for local or long trips.",5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"I was invited to purchase this early release so I suppose Amazon has a lot to do about enhancing this product. I will summarize my first week experience as follows:-It has to take over the car audio, by this I must keep the audio channel to Bluetooth all the time, letting go of all of the following: media stored on the card hard drive, radio, car apps that include streaming services, CD/DVD, and USB.",1,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
I originally got this for my older brother but a purchase of a car with a infotainment system not to be used with Echo Auto brought this Echo to my possession.  Breaking in period with Echo Auto and its been interesting.  There’s a lot of things  I ask for that can’t be done for now until more time behind the wheel is spent.  I was already blown away with music.  I subscribe with Pandora and the car I have has an info system I can use Echo Auto with.  The Bluetooth system in my car and a Pandora DONT work too well together but Alexa and Pandora work great together. That’s it for now.,4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"I had high hopes for this device. I waited patiently for months to get one, but ultimately it was a disappointment. Unless the audio for my car was set to bluetooth, it didn't work. Meaning, if I was listening to terrestrial or satellite radio, it was worthless. Even if I were willing to accept that it only worked under those circumstances, it didn't work well. I looked forward to hearing Amazon Music through the device, as I do with the Alexa devices in my house. It never made it through a single song without freezing up. Great idea, but it's just not  there yet.",2,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"I like this product .  I must admit the one drawback is every time I want to use this device I have to go back to Bluetooth and settings on my truck radio(2018 Toyota Tacoma) to get it working. If I don't do it when I first start the truck, I simply can't fiddle with it when I am driving. When it is working properly the sound is integrated with the sound system in the truck and it sounds well",4,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

"I did not care for the fact that I could not do talk to text with this device or that this device could not read me my text messages. Also, it just looked awkward on the dashboard of my Dodge Journey, perhaps it is more ergonomically functional for some car models than others.

"Bought this to use on a long road trip because I wanted to have control over what I would listen to during the trip. This little device fit the bill perfectly. Came with everything needed to install in the car. After installation, it blended fairly well with the rest of the dashboard and did not stick out like a sore thumb.Overall, it performed flawlessly and allowed me to listen to what I wanted to listen to.

"I like it while it works however, I constantly have to set it up over and over again eventually in the Alexa app to be able to use it again...It either deletes itself from my device lost or in order to get it to want to connect again, I have to go into the Alex app, choose to forget the device and then re-add it.

I have an iPhone so overall found it’s not much different than using Siri, does the same things.  What I don’t like is that since it goes through my iPhone via Bluetooth, I’ve not found a way that I can have it go through my phone, yet still be able to listen to the radio or listen to songs via my USB port in my car.  If I’m getting directions, things are “tied up” for some time.  At this point, I doubt I’ll end up using it much and to be honest, I guess I’m somewhat a little disappointed – not what I expected I guess.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"It’s nice but having a 2013 Silverado I have to use the Aux cable, which means if I want to hear Alexa I have to change it to Aux. making calls is easy as long as you have it on Aux.

We own every single echo device (except the Tap) and are hardcore fans. This one just misses the mark. It’s barely any different than using the Alexa app (since the phone is always on Bluetooth). I just haven’t seen any benefits really of it and have removed it from my car. It’s just sitting in the glove compartment. It would be worth something if the App wasn’t so good on its own.,1,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I was hoping the auto integration to the car would be better.  It would be great if Alexa automatically responded when the trigger word is called. However, it is not. If you are listening to the radio, you cannot just engage Alexa.

You are better off just using your smartphone directly.",2,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"Horrible, doesnt work on 2207 model cars or less unless you have blue tooth and the cassette player audio does not work!

I love the Amazon Echo.  It is pretty easy to set up. I do feel that the degree that it works is directly related to the connection your phone has while you’re driving. The signal tends to drop or be non existent is the same areas that I get a weak signal with Sirius XM. I’m not sure Amazon can do anything about that. Most of the time it works well. It’s a good idea to unplug the phone if you are having problems connecting to the network.,5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"When I saw this, I knew I had to have it. Well let me tell you, it has not disappointed. I have not had a single issue with the Alexa not working. It is quick to connect, and doesn’t have an issues unless I am in an area where my service is weak. The sound is good and I have enjoyed having it in my car.My only complaint is my Alexa did not come with a dash mount, only the air vent mount. This hasn’t been too bad except for the back that only a week into having my air vent mount the piece that holds the wire broke and continues to come off of the vent mount constantly.",4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"It worked great for 1 year Only. I can't deny I ❤ it, people needs to know the device is disposable and last ONLY 1 year. Amazon ONLY gives 1 year warranty which means basically NO warranty. They refused to send label to return it so they can figure out why it unexpectedly died. Amazon will give U 15% dsct. so U can buy another 1 instead. I wanted to send it back not for a replacement or fix but because they don't keep manufacturing a device that will last 1 year only.  Probably reason why was inexpensive but it doesn't justify the issues.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0

"The product needs to be recalled, sent back to engineering and design.  For example if you ask Alexa something in your house she will tell you whats up, like a location or hours of operation.

tried to use the sticky thing but decided against it in case I wanted to remove the unit later....decided I didn't really need to have it with my cell phone handy to speak to Siri....good thing was I didn't pay much for the unit so it was a learning experience.  First Amazon product I was disappointed with the outcome....still a first rate company with all of the other products I own.,1,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"The Echo Auto was smaller then I expected, which is nice for mounting.  I like clean looking connections, and the cables coming out the side kind of bother me because of this, but it’s so small there isn’t a whole lot more options.  It’s not really an Echo, it’s a voice activation trigger for the Alexa App on your phone.  It works pretty well, and I have no functionality complaints.  Works even in a vehicle that has a decent amount of background noise, so the microphones are well set up.  I would like an extra power input on the back, so you have an option to not have this big cable sticking out of the side, and mounting options in general are slim right now, but I expect that to change.  The light bar for visual feedback is nice, not too bright or any thing, and still visible.  The sound quality isn’t a factor, really, as it triggers music playing from your phone, so the limiting factor isn’t the Echo Auto.  I’m satisfied with its functionality.",4,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0

"I have many Alexa devices and this one falls short. I don’t like the fact that there is no useable internal speaker.

Liked it a lot. I’ve been wanting to do something like this ever since I bought an echo dot so I was pretty pysched to hear they made an automobile version. Voice recognition is just as good as an echo dot. Sound quality seems better than if I was to play a video off of YouTube. The mount  itself is pretty sweet. I like the magnetized holder. I don’t have Bluetooth in my car but no issues as it comes with an aux cord so I hooked it up that way.

"Overall, the echo auto works very well.  It recognizes voices well, and integrates easily with a lot of the functions that I use in my car.  I only have a few nit picky things that I believe could be improved upon.  On dislike is that it always has to be plugged into a charger.  I would really like to see this have some kind of rechargeable battery to avoid the wires.  The other thing that is just a little bit of an annoyance is that if you have your phone connected via Bluetooth like mine is, you cannot properly use the echo auto unless the car is switched to having the audio played through your phone.  If you are listening to the radio or have the audio off, the echo listens but will only respond through the speakers of the car.

"Frankly it has not met my expectations.  There are times when it won't connect to my iPhone.  I've found that if I unplug it, and then plug it in again, it will then connect.  Also, virtually every time Alexa responds, she gets one or two words out, then cuts out for a moment, and then comes back in, usually having failed to provide the most critical part of  the request.  I called Amazon and talked to a representative who told me that the the problem of Alexa cutting out was one that had been reported by others, and that Amazon was ""working on it.""  I was asked what kind of phone I  had, and told the representative that  I have  an iPhone 6.  Not sure if that has an impact on my problem.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

"Let me start by saying this is not near as good as the Echo or the Echo Dot, although it probably wasn't designed to be since it wouldn't be used as much as your in home Alexa devices.  It's a nice size, doesn't take up too much room, doesn't get in the way.  I've had it loose connection a few times but it didn't last long and it was in areas a fair distance outside the city.  It's very useful for getting directions, making calls, playing music, asking when things open and close, and even turning off the house lights if you forgot to on your way out the door!  Overall, I like the product!  I think it could definitely improve some, but it mostly gets it's job done and keeps your hands on the wheel!  I would recommend possibly waiting for a second generation if you don't just have to have it right now and are willing to wait a little bit.",4,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"I love when Alexa is responsive to my requests to play the songs I request. I DO NOT LIKE it when Alexa is resistant  to connecting to my iphone.

I have read and re-read the directions to connect and don't know why Alexa can't follow the initial requests.  Control issues?  Maybe Alexa needs some therapy?",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"This device is constructed of 100% Grade-A connection issues. If you get it to pair the first time, you're in luck! You'll be treated to an eternal cycle of opening the Alexa app on your phone again so it can re-connect. Maps integration is genuinely awful. If it hears what you said, and doesn't mistake a street name for a contact's last name, it will pop open your maps app and forget it ever existed. Play music and navigate at the same time? Sure! But every time your maps tries to speak to you, the music pauses. It -is- as annoying as it sounds. You can get around this by running the Amazon Music app from your phone, instead of asking Echo Auto to play the music for you. But then Echo Auto can no longer control the music (wtf?).This device does not belong in a car. There are too many finnicky details and unfinished features. Re-develop this with car drivers in mind. Now.",3,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

Besides getting my music requests to play, I'm able to get my news, weather, comedy, and a host of other things from Alexa. I'm also able to make hands free calls just by asking Alexa to call a person from my cellphone contacts. Prior to receiving Alexa for my car I had renewed my yearly subscription with Sirius XM, but I don't plan on renewing for next year since Echo Auto is a better alternative for my needs, and the monthly cost for Amazon's music subscription is far cheaper than what I paid for a year of Sirius XM.

"Easy to set-up and use.  Performs exactly as one would expect.  For others like me with an older car that doesn’t have Bluetooth or an aux jack, my workaround was to get an FM transmitter.  I just plugged the Alexa in for power and then synch’d with my phone and then plugged then FM transmitter into my phone and tune the radio to the channel the transmitter is displaying.  The Alexa device acts as a voice control for the Alexa app on your phone and the output sound is relayed through the FM transmitter to your radio.Audio quality is a little degraded but not by much (it’s like going from a CD to a really clear FM radio station) and it’s on par with the car audio quality (obviously an older stereo).",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0

I can't ""voice to text"" and don't understand why.  Not a huge deal - a minor annoyance if anything.  What does bother me, though, is when I ask Alexa to play morning news headlines - more than something that lasts a few minutes.  It has yet to go back to the BT audio that my phone is playing.  Again, not a deal killer.  Fun device!",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0

If I make a lot of short trips during the day I encounter this problem; however, one long road trip and it works without a hiccup.

"It was very simple to set up the device in my car and pair with my Samsung Galaxy S9+, and for the most part works as advertised with one exception. The voice recognition does have trouble at times. Once Alexa and I both adjusted to this hurdle though, it's been fun learning new things to ask her. Currently, we're enjoying jokes from Jimmy Fallon. The navigation is questionable as she doesn't always recognize the address I'm trying to get to. I don't know if Garmin is the system used by the Echo Auto, but my old Garmin with Alexa did fail me often in the past. Beyond those two less than perfect functions, I've enjoyed having Alexa as my co-pilot and look forward to improvements in the device in the future.",4,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

It works through your phone, so it is important that you have good service, and unlimited data with whatever cell phone network you have. I would say the one trouble that this device has, is that when it's hot or cold outside and you have the fan of your AC or heat turned up all the way, it cannot hear you. You have to take it off at stand and put it close to your face when you're talking to it. Which kind of defeats the purpose. There really needs to be a dash Mount, rather than only a vent mount. However, it can withstand hundred degree temperatures and still function, which is pretty impressive for an electronic device. So far, it can also withstand down to the teens and temperature as well, we shall see if it can stand lower than that. Overall, I would buy it again.",4,1,2019-11-19,1,0,1

This was purchased with a gift card with the intentions of a birthday gift and I got the combo that came with the Echo Dot and the one for the car. The dot works fantastic in the house but the one for the car does not work. I was in the process of moving when I received my gift so I kept it boxed so it would not get lost in the shuffle. Once I arrive to my new home I started to unpack and set up my new gifts. I would say don’t waste the money on this.,1,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I’m the proud owner of 8 Alexa devices and this is the first one that falls way short of expectations.  Voice recognition is horrible.

I thought I was on the waiting list for this device for almost a year @ $25, however when it was available to me it was $45.

"It is great when it works, but that can be problematic considering it drops connection with my phone frequently.  I'm driving down the road and ask the device a question just to discover that it isn't connected anymore.

It isn't handsfree if I'm risking my life and the lives of others to reconnect.  I have disconnected the Echo Auto, and I now use Android Auto on my phone.  The android app has never had an issue for me.",1,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0

Works well. Glad I purchased.,4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

I got this free as a gift from my car insurance provider so beggars can’t be choosers but what is the point in this if you have a smart phone?

I read some of the reviews here and I really can't relate because so far it working like a champ for me!  I have it paired with my Samsung Galaxy 9+.  The built-in mics are catching every command I give it and it is working just like by Echo at home.  Makes it super easy to move between radio stations that are streaming rather than using the static laden conventional radio tuner.

Works great when phone is connected to only car and Echo auto BUT... My Samsung S10 stays connected to my earbuds and connects to Alexa but wont connect to car via Bluetooth without manually selecting in Bluetooth settings. It's only a few button clicks but the point of the whole setup is to not touch anything. Should also come with a stand that doesn't utilize vents.

By the way, Alexa says 2 and says that she thinks you knew that.  It usually can do 1 + 1 and is on, but simply ignoring or falling to do all other commands.

When you ask for directions it prompts you to tap on the notification on your phone to open the Maps app on your phone before it can start actually giving you directions. You have to do this regardless of whether or not you already have the maps app open or not. The fact that this voice assistant for your car can’t handle navigation, the most basic function I’m looking for in any sort of car assistant is honestly shocking.

Works well for music and things like that but very disappointed overall.Edit:  Was contacted by customer service who tried to help work out the problems.

I would be pretty happy with the device if it weren't for the poor call quality.  People on the other end of a call through the device can barely hear me.  You would think that a device with 6 microphones would provide excellent call quality, but that is not the case.  Due to this fact alone, I can't really use the device.

This is perfect for what I needed it to do!  I don't have built in bluetooth media on my car and I wanted something to play spotify through my speakers.  It understands my requests the first time and rarely has the issue connecting to my phone.  When that happens I find that just restarting my phone quickly fixes it.

So much so that i didn’t immediately install my Alexa auto right away thinking it would be the same. Boy was i wrong about it and i love it. Couldn’t give 5 stars because there are some connectivity issues with the devise and mine tends to get stuck and restart causing my phone to also lose bt connection to my car until it restarts.

The convenience of having the echo in the car is undeniable. The main issue I run into which is exceedingly annoying and defeats the purpose of having a hands-free device such as this is that it constantly tells me that it has lost touch with the Amazon Alexa app on my phone and I have to open it up while I am driving to get it to work which is counterproductive. Amazon needs to work on this feature so it is not so dependent on the Alexa app on your telephone and I'm not talking a day or two apart this is getting in and out of the car and loses touch frequently.,3,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

My iPhone used the same Bluetooth connection to link to my speakers and I’ve always been disappointed with the sound quality and voice command.

The Alexa device we had for our car before Amazon's official one was a knock-off and we had doubts when we got this one just because of how poorly the other one worked. But the echo works wonderfully in the car; it hears us fine over music and air conditioning. It is a nice hands-free music player and does everything you would expect out of Alexa. Bottom line: we love it!,5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I mostly like the Echo Auto. It is nice to be able to sync to my phone’s music so I can skip songs as I drive. It’s also nice for telling it to make phone calls. It will occasionally not be able to connect and it won’t send texts for me. I’m not sure why it can go in my contacts for calls but not texts. Also because my car is synced to the Echo, I haven’t been able to use Siri without touching my phone. I do like being able to set reminders With the Echo while I drive or add things to my grocery list through voice. commands.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"The product itself didn't work. It kept disconnecting and asking me to go through the set up process every time it connected. Also, connecting my stereo through the jack didn't work either. I have two other bluetooth devices that work fine in the jack that's in my truck, so it's not my truck that was the problem. However, Amazon was great about returning the item, so no complaints there!",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"It is great to have access to all of my music in my Tesla.  Yes I could stream from my iPhone but it is much more convenient (and safer) to use my voice.  Almost all Echo commands and skills work but you will miss alarms and timers.  Also missing is the ability to change the wale word from ""Alexa"".  I use ""Echo"" as the wake word for my other devices so I find myself forgetting when I get in the car.  Navigation works well with Waze, Google Maps or Apple Maps.  Voice calling works but it calls my home Echo instead of my home phone.  Even though it still feels a bit ""Beta"" it is a big improvement over just Bluetooth.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,1,1

I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I  could. Nice to have Alexa on the go. The voice recognition for phone calls is so much better then my stereo.  There's always room for improvement and Amazon is really good at improving their Alexa stuff, so I'm sure that people's suggestions for improvement will be addressed.",4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"I really like it, got it for christmas this year.I haven't had many connections issues however my boyfriend says theres a horrible echo on his end when he calls me on it. Its been really good for listening to music which is what I wanted it for mostly because my car only gets 1 radio station reliably. Once and a while Alexa ignores me then I have to use my phone to control it but it's a pretty decent auto accessory.

"Is great in concept, a few things could be improved.  Firstly the mounting system is secure, but hanging wires look ugly so I just laid it in the cubby hole in my center console.  The other problem I had is I have the same alexa account on multiple phones but the device only shows up on one phone (the one I originally set it up on) which makes it difficult to use for multiple drivers.  Thirdly, and this is not the fault of the device itself, but the process of getting it ready when you start the car is a bit of a pain.  I have a 2017 Hyundai and I have to turn on the car, wait about 1 minute for my phone to connect via bluetooth, ask alexa to play something, then touch the media button on my infotainment system before I hear anything.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

The price point is good, and it's got an extra port in the charger so you can also have a phone cord in there.  It functions just like the Alexa in your house...so cool! Ask her for nearby restaurants, weather, reminders, to play music...it's great and perfect addition to your car.  Get it now!",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0

But I do have multiple Echo devices and quite like using Alexa. The ability to easily access multiple music/audio sources using an interface I use all the time is a huge plus.But it's not perfect. When Alexa is speaking to me, she routinely cuts out near the end of whatever she is saying. Bluetooth issue? Not sure...but occasionally Alexa also loses connectivity to my phone...but a quick reset makes everything work again.

While I can hear fine, the person on the other end doesn't hear me very well.  I have a set of bluetooth earbuds and I haven't had any complaints using them, so it's not the phone.I have other issues, but I think they're at least partially phone related.

When I do get it to work & I say ""Alexa"" the beep happens but within one second I get another beep as if she's done listening to me. I have to press the button on the unit to get it to listen to me long enough to do anything. The sticky part that holds the wires in place on the vent mount is no longer sticking & falls off. The vent mount  doesn't work correctly because Alexa is too heavy so it just flops over. All it really does for me is blu-tooth my phone to my radio for music instead of using an auxiliary cord.

Every time I get in the car I have to unplug it and plug it back up and then again about every 15-20 minutes. So I pretty much just use it just to listen to music, which I was doing just fine with without one. Oh and also, the sticky part that holds the cord to the mount fell off the first day.

That doesn’t happen when I’m listening through alexa and I have to start things all over again.

I don't know how but I can ask Alexa to play my radio station and it works where my car radio won't.  It's puzzling because I can't even make a phone call in these areas.  I live between 2 mountain ranges so when driving through areas with no radio I can now listen using my car Alexa to play my radio station.  This is really a great thing!!!!  Not to mention it so much easier to listen to audio books because it's hands free.,4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I was really disappointed in this product. My kids were so excited to have Alexa in the car but there were several issues. Ridiculous cabling. Why?? You had to be switched to Bluetooth in order for it to work. In my car, If you were on Bluetooth, it wouldn’t allow my phone to connect at the same time so I couldn’t be handsfree for phone calls...however I can have 2 phones connected so I’m not sure as to why this wouldn’t work. Additionally, if I wanted to listen to the regular FM radio but ask Alexa for the weather or time or some inane question from my kids (“hey Alexa, ask for a fart“ is a favorite), it wouldn’t just kick on to my dash or even directly from the device to answer the question. It would just answer the question in the Bluetooth mode but we couldn’t hear it because we were on FM radio. The real kicker was about a week after we bought it, it stopped working because it said the USB power consumption was too high. Considering we frequently have 2 phones and an iPod plugged into the car, this seems a bit ridiculous that a single device, DESIGNED for automotive usage requires more power than the auto can provide? Super disappointed.",1,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0

The only time I have issues is when my cell phone doesn’t have signal. But that’s not the fault of the Alexa.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Cool concept, at first I thought it may be something I would use frequently.  Had it for several months now and my biggest disappointment is connection issues.  I use an iPhone.  I spend at least 70-75% of the time having to reconnect it as a brand new device... Defeats the hands free purpose and makes it an inconvenience having to take 3-5 mins every other time I get in the vehicle and want to use it.  Sometimes it will connect fine and when it does I do have fun with it. The vent bracket is a bit large and occasionally falls off.  i thought there may be a sticky attachment to stick on top of the dashboard.",2,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
Alexa has changed my driving experience! I traveled twice lately and dont know what I would do without her! I am babysitting grandkids this week and actually moved her into my daughters car (I am driving for car seats) the VERY FIRST DAY after 4 hour of driving without her! WARNING...

I have enjoyed using Echo Auto in my work vehicle.  It gives me control of my phone that used to require pushing a button.Now I just speak and Alexa does the work for me.  With the new laws here in Florida people can get fined for holding their phone while driving.  Alexa allows phone use without holding it.  Once again technology gets ahead of legislature.,5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
Absolutely not what I was hoping this device would be. I have a hard time to connect to it while still in the driveway (home Wi-Fi )and when I drove out of the driveway connection was gone and never connected to my phone.

"This product is just like everyone else is saying, it is a pain! It will not connect to your phone automatically and trying to figure out how to connect it, even following instructions, is ridiculous.

I use it with a Pixel 3 XL and a 2015 Subaru Outback.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
Well for one there is no display.  Not sure why that is an option to rate. It also messes with CarPlay and the stereo itself basically disabling sound.  I spent 10 mins the other day trying to figure out why I couldn’t get CarPlay navigation directions and sound from SiriusXM on my car stereo.  And I’m also not a fan of the Alexa app asking me if I’m driving or a passenger when I’m sitting on my couch in my living room trying to make a change to Alexa.  This needs a lot of work in my opinion. I usually have to the first command at least two times befor I get an Audi response.  The first response is completely silent as if Alexa hasn’t cull connected the audio then it hijacks my stereo.,1,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Works great with the car Bluetooth. Quick and responsive and hears commands through music. Much better than the Roav Google Assistant which didn't work at all.I did buy a charging cable with a switch on it so I can turn it off when parked in the garage, that way it doesn't stay connected to my phone's Bluetooth when I'm in the house and am not using it.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I got Echo Auto as a gift so I installed it in my car which does not have Bluetooth and I installed the app on my phone. I did not like the setup to the vent and the 2 cables hanging there.

Was only able to get it to work by using the Mercedes cable for the iphone.  Did not work like the Echo in my house.

While I am listening to Sirius or regular radio and I say ""Alexa what's the weather"" it does not speak over the radio.  I have to physically punch over to bluetooth then make my statement.  That is still not hands free.  I want it to speak over just like Waze and Maps does.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
Worst piece of junk I’ve ever gotten from Amazon.  Nationwide provided this to for free.  They got ripped off by Amazon.

In the Nissan I can switch from media to SiriusXM and Echo still works, she talks over the music. In the Lincoln I have to stay connected to media for Echo to work.

Was excited to finally get this after being on the waitlist forever. I spend a lot of time commuting and I had hoped to get some usefulness out of this product. Needless to say super disappointed. Rarely recognizes my voice. Always seems to be listening (blue light on) and it’s very slow when it does recognize your voice. Also the setup is a bit bulky with cords all over the place.  Overall I would not recommend this product. I’d wait for an improvement.,2,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"Pretty nifty.  Setup wasnt difficult,  but because you have to connect to phone and connect to car audio it's not plug and play either.

"Waited for almost a year on the waiting list, I got it with huge anticipation.  I was equally and more h disappointed.  The integration is definitely not seamless and complicated. The connection disconnect constantly and it is very annoying.  The function was not up to bar, so the added ugly devise on the top of my dashboard with wires was not acceptable.

"Got this for my dumb car to see if I can make it more hands free when operating. Love when I can ask Alexa to add to lists, grab Apple Music, or listen to an audiobook. Sometimes glitchy with connection to iPhone, but usually a quick fix to reconnect to Alexa. Really like how I can make announcements at home from the road. Haven’t tried dropping in yet.In all, good product for $25. Keep innovating and it will be a solid product. Will probably get another for my teen driver.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
I really love the idea of this.  Sometimes the voice activation and commands are eh though.  The way it sets up navigation on the iPhone is just idk feels kinda dumb.  And a lot of times the voice feature doesn't work properly unless I hit the button the start it.  And the navigation doesn't speak anymore.  Otherwise it's a great little invention.  Needs more placement options.,3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Although I overall love the unit, there is one specific thing I don't care for. Because of its BT use I can not use my Android Auto along side Alex Auto. Its a combo of the car, phone, can Alexa not syncing. When hardwired for Android Auto it disables my BT connection, which disables Alexa. Although I can use AA. Reconfirming which Amazon Music account I want to use gets old quickly as well.The industry needs to stop being proprietary and learn to play well with others. Alexa needs to integrate with AA so I can plug in and just use Alexa to control all my Android Auto systems. I can Use Alexa by pressing my home key on my phone, but then its not a hands free system, which is why I got AlexaAuto to begin with.",4,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
This thing is pretty amazing as far as allowing  You too Use Alexa. The only problem I have with this is that it’s not wireless And not chargeable it would be nice if you could charge it and then you would Not have to use the cord At all times Or worry about unplugging it every time you turn the car off. It Bluetooth very easily though and you have a fully functional Alexa.,4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"To be able to bring all that Alexa has to offer into the car with me now is pretty unreal. Way better voice calling than what's built into my car, and far safer to be able to voice command for Pandora, Amazon Music, XM, weather, news, etc. The only issue is the short window of transition while driving away from a wifi zone...until it fully switches to cellular data, it understandably can't connect.

Alexa is almost top notch but it still has some bad quirks.  If the inside of the vehicle is a little noise it won't hear you or listen correctly.

"Because this device connects to the phone via Bluetooth, listening to music while driving is very annoying because all sounds from your phone are broadcast into your car speakers. So there's a lot of interruptions and the the music freezes up for a few seconds whenever there's a notification coming in. Talking to the device to choose a song while on a road trip is a very nice feature, but we need an option to block intruding sounds from the other apps while listening to music, while at the same time allowing the bells and beeps from notifications still play but only on your phone. I'm usually the passenger while my family rides, and I control the music, but I also need to receive certain notifications on the phone, so the phone's ""do not disturb"" feature is not a good solution.",1,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

Additionally, she will pick up where I left off on my Audible book or play the most random song I can think of to enlighten my drive.

This thing is simple and cool. If you want Alexa in your car this works pretty flawlessly as far as I can see.

Makes it super easy to stay hands-free from your phone in the car. My kids ask her all kinds of things in the car about random facts, how many days until Christmas, etc. It’s very reliable. Turns on and syncs with my phone seamlessly every time I get in the car. I love it!!",5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift- for her Jeep Wrangler. The challenge with this device was that it wouldn't connect through Bluetooth without re-pairing the device constantly, which it really needs internet access full-time and to be powered on at all times. There are other ways to mount the device rather than the ac vent clip, but the overall connectivity was a huge issue. While I do really enjoy all my Alexa devices this one is not a win.",1,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"The instructions for setting this up were not very clear or helpful -  for example, I did not understand that you don’t need to pair the echo auto with the vehicle and wasted a lot of time trying to do this.  Not until I called tech support did I understand the device just had to be connected to my phone. Also, there’s nothing telling you that the Alexa App has to be open and at least running in the background to use the echo auto. Once I got this all figured out and the device was hooked up, I’m not sure I couldn’t have done the same by just connecting my phone to the vehicle via Bluetooth - this device just gives you the ability to give the Alexa app on you phone voice commands in the car.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
This was more of a pain to use than it was worth. It interfered with the phone connecting to the car’s Bluetooth system.  Was clunky and didn’t work smoothly.  I don’t want to spend two minutes every time I get in the car fiddling with something that is supposed to make my life easier.  Not worth the hassle- Siri does everything easier and better when in the car.,2,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0
I bought this one on early release and after using it few times it is clear that this is not a ready product. Not having it's own speaker is really no no for me. You have to connect to your car stereo with bluetooth but that means you cant play songs or radio on car stereo. You have to use your cell phone plan for music and that means your data plan will go through roof. That was a big let down. Unfortunately it was too late to return and my money is completely wasted.,1,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"Amazon has a lot to do before Alexa Auto is a real competitor. For example, when I was less than 2 miles out and said, “Alexa, directions to Costco,” she tried directing me to a store that was 15 miles away (Google maps on Android integration). She was also not able to respond to “Alexa, play This American Life on Stitcher.”It’s great from Amazon Music or integrating with my smart home gear, but it isn’t there yet as a smart car integration.",3,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
I truly love this.  I was able to cancel my Sirius subscription that was costing way too much and get just the streaming subscription.  The streaming subscription will get you more channels than the full package would.  I am able to listening to all of them and more on the Echo Auto.  I generally listen to audio books during my commute.  I occasionally have slight connectivity problems but never a real issue.  I even ordered a second one.,5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"Not sure if this was tested, but doesn't seem to work very often.  I realize they depend on the phone signal, but I've checked when I called out to Alex and saw the blue light light up and I ask Alexa to do something and then nothing happens.  A minute later, I ask the same thing and it works.  At best, this is a spotty device.  I hope they can fix it with a software update at some point soon.  It's a great idea otherwise and I was very excited to set it up.",1,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0

This product I don’t use much. It’s a pain to hook up to car then in order to use it you need to connect phone to car and have the Alexa app open. First time hooking up took 2 hours with customer support to figure it out. It works if u can remember to hook it up each time u get into car which I don’t so we don’t use it much.  Would be nicer if I could run off my car WiFi. The mounts don’t work well either. Falls apart easy and won’t stay in the car vent so the Alexa just sits in my cup holder. I use my other Alexa stuff in the house much more than the car one. I personally would not buy again,3,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"This is without reservation, the dumbest and most ill advised piece of technology that I’ve ever had the displeasure of using. First, let me say that it was given to me free from Nationwide, so I figured I’d give it a shot. It looks very sleek and the instructions are very simple, the only problem, it doesn’t work as advertised! You need to download the Alexa app and integrate it with your Echo Auto, only it rarely, if ever, actually syncs up once you’ve set it up. I wasn’t really excited about the technology and after trying it, I’m glad that I didn’t pay for it. I actually left it on top of a trash can at a Lowes in my neighborhood.

Every time I got in the car the and tried to talk to her she said “lost connection with the Alexa app” and I had to get out my phone to reconnect which was pointless since I mostly got this to control my music hands free and could start that before driving anyways. The other main reason I wanted to try this was for directions and every time I tried it she would try to give me directions to one singular place in a different state. Only other complaint as someone whose name is very close to “Alexa” is that you can’t change the wake word at all. After a couple weeks I had enough and returned it.",2,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

And, if I forget to leave a particular light on, Alexa will do it for me if I ask. She's good for finding places; and, you know all the rest.  FYI, my Android phone is on it's way out (charging troubles) - so I set Alexa up to work through my iPad; I just have to start the Alexa app and throw it in my purse...and she connects as soon as I start the car and push the on button!

I set everything up, which was incredibly easy, and enjoyed the first day.  When I got in my car the second day, it wouldn’t connect.  I tried several days in a row, and everyday I had to set everything back up.  I have a cube tv, echo dot, echo show 2, echo first gen, echo plus, and a fire stick, so I am very familiar with everything Alexa.  I even have my security system and cameras set up through Alexa and every light in my house.  I was so disappointed with everything the auto promised.

"It is great having Alexa in the car.  The negative is that you have to open the app and click on ""I am a passenger"" every time you first get in the car before it will connect.  Also cannot leave in hot car. Must unplug and put in purse and take out of car with you then plug back in when you return. I can leave it when I am parked in my garage, but when at work or shopping I have to unplug it and take it with me. The third negative is that it also picks up every sound your phone makes, such as clicks when you turn your phone screen off and texting whoosh sound.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
It improved my cars sound with hands free calling.  It thinks it’s not connected when it is connect half the time which is frustrating.

I've had few problems with the device itself, the only one being that on occasion I need to open the app for it to work, which is only a problem because touching your phone is illegal in my state. However, the vent mount itself needs some work. It fits over my vent just fine and holds the echo very well, but the cord holder is a problem. It is attached to the mount only by a something sticky, and it does not stick very well. After only three days the holder fell off of the mount. It remained sticky, so I reattached it and it worked, for a day. Since then, it has fallen off with increasing frequency, which is rather annoying. It's merely a bother, which is why I have still given the echo 4 stars (it would be 4.5, but I couldn't do halves). I just hope it is a feature that will be improved in the future.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,1

It's great at doing ""Alexa"" things, however when it comes to playing music i noticed that unless my phone it plugged into my cars USB that the music sounds rattled and distorted like a lightly blown speaker. Now you might say ""then just keep it plugged into the USB port"", but that brings me to the next problem. When the phone is plugged in, my cars steering wheel buttons and the infotainment screen shows/plays music through the amazon MUSIC app, however the echo auto seems to play through the ALEXA app, so the song on my screen will be wrong and if i use my steering wheel audio buttons it will switch whatever playlist i was listening to on the echo auto to my amazon music app. First world grievances, but defeats the purpose I bought it for",3,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0

I love this “baby Alexa “.  I can now stream all of my Amazon music playlists through my car’s sound system. For best results your car needs to be equipped with Bluetooth and/or a USB port. Of course you will need to have your iPhone or Galaxy etc with you. Other types of connections may work so you need to check with Amazon Alexa or the manufacturer of your car’s sound system. This is a great little streaming device!! It will also turn on indoor devices such as lights etc as long as you are within range. I hope this little gem will work for you!,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"So here's the thing. It's nice if you have a car that can't play music over Bluetooth, but it really doesn't add anything your smartphone can't already do. The extra microphones so that it can hear you better in noisy road conditions is a good idea, but it seems like it doesn't matter over truly bad conditions (such as when windows are rolled down).Overall I think it's a nice idea, but it doesn't really add anything new.",3,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

Now I understand that people lose service while driving, and everyone haves the stretch of road when dead-zone lurks all the time. What I was experiencing was all the time lost connection, and the hassle of telling Alexa to play song over and over with no results.

Honestly the only thing I miss  are those physical buttons. Echo Auto pairs well when I get in the car and has a great sound quality. Having to connect to the app at times can be annoying as it needs to be able to connect to the app to use Alexa and your internet connection.

Perfect addition if your vehicle doesn’t have Apple car play.  The frustration expressed by some others must be due to signal strength issues with their cell phone provider.  (I’ve experienced the same issue with an Alexa enabled Garmin dash cam at our vacation home).  My Echo Auto boots up immediately and the voice recognition as good as my other Alex’s household devices.  Definitely worth if if you like to stream your Amazon Music Unlimited or other streaming services in the car.  I wouldn’t buy this for navigation.

There is an internal speaker (small) inside the Echo Auto--you can hear it on set up and when it's not connected to the app.  If Amazon would allow the internal speaker to be used, this would be perfect.

I normally like most of these products but I feel like I wasted my mone6 on this one. Can't really find a good use for it. Dosnt work all that great. My phone pretty much does the same thing.,1,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0
"Installed, deleted, installed several times. It does not send alexa through car stereo/ speakers via Bluetooth. Instead, the alexa communication is coming over the iPhone. This may look like simple compatibility issue with not being supported by a specific car but seperate from this, Google maps and Apple maps have always and still play over my car speakers just fine. Those apps use HFP (hands free profile), could this be an issue with echo autos implementation of HFP?",1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I absolutely love having Alexa in my 2010 Prius.

"Works just like your Alexa at home, but in the car.  She can hear you over the normal noise, though be careful if you are rocking out to Heavy Metal at max volume as she might not hear you...which is completely understandable lol. Previously I used to get in the car, set up my Iphone, open my app, shuffle or select.  Now I just get in the car and tell Alexa to start my music or my audiobooks (for the long rides)  It's a lot smaller than you think, no wider than my air vents on my truck and snaps in with magnets to the air vent holder, so it's easy to store away (thieves love seeing electronics)  Love it!",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"I heard so much about this that I thought I would give it a try. LOVE IT!. The one part of it that is for safety issues but sometimes inconvenient is if you want to tell Alexa to do something, it will only respond if you are a passenger. You have to go into the Alexa app and say you are a passenger or it will not respond back. Other than that, I am so glad I got it.( I did have some problems with setting it up but after 3 trys, it finally started working.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

The problem I have with this is apparently same as many others.  There does not seem to be way to play sound in AUX only and not on your phone.  I want to play music in AUX OUT but it plays on my phone too.  I just want the sound to come out of ECHO AUX  - not my phone!  Or you can't seem to pair the ECHO to your car - its paired to your phone and your phone is paired to your car.  Horrible design.  It should have just used your phone hotspot and operated like any other echo - wow Amazon blew this one.  I am huge AMAZON fan -  and ECHO fan - Just not an ECHO Auto fan,1,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Very interesting, easy to set up and small enough to place it anywhere. Really like the setup, the only thing that will need improvement is the sound volume and quality.

I have a 2002 Lexus with no Bluetooth or auxiliary connectivity. However I used a cassette adaptor and set up went very easy. I mainly use it for GPS directions and Amazon music.

This unit should be a plug and play unit and be as easy to set up in a vehicle as other Alexa units can be set up in the house.

I am torn on this review. It’s really handy to have in the car but needs some bugs worked out. It loses its connection to your phone every time the car shuts off.

I have been using a kindle and Amazon Prime since they first came out and it has been awesome watching Amazon Prime grow into what it is today.

"I used this in my 2004 car and though it was nice for a little, it became too unreliable and would rarely work. What’s worse is I left my car parked for about a month without driving it, and it drained my cars battery. It’s also super annoying how my phone will automatically connect to it when my car is off.  Not a huge fan of this product, but it is nice how it allowed me to do things hands-free with my voice.Overall it needs work",2,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
I received mine on September 12th and used it in my camper for two weeks.  This is a great item for camping because you just need a cell phone and the Alexa app and a speaker to plug it into.

Alexa has a hard time connecting to the app. Which it has to do every time the car is started. If I pull up the app it connects 30%of the time. Most of the time a series of reboots of the app and Alexa is needed to get her connected. If you use your phone it seems to disconnect Alexa from the app. I make 3 hr drives 2-3 times a month and rarely will Alexa stay connected for the full ride. There should be a WiFi option for cars with WiFi as I feel this would work more like the original  Alexa.  Bluetooth to the car for speakers?,2,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"Can't change the wake word. Why can't I change the wake word?

"It doesn’t work as efficiently as an in home echo device which is really disappointing. First off, you need to open your Alexa app before you can even use the Alexa auto. Second, it seems like a lot of the functions or “skills” that any normal echo device uses require extra hands on help from you before they can actually be utilized by Alexa auto. For example, if you ask Alexa auto to play something off Spotify it is unable to do so unless you open the app on your phone. I’ve even had trouble getting Alexa auto to play music off Spotify once the app has been opened. Lastly, the vent mount really doesn’t work well it keeps falling off, I wish there was another type of mount.

Maybe it works better in some areas and not in all or with some wireless providers over others, but we had zero luck getting it to work.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"So I got this as an early buyer for $25 and that’s about what I think it’s worth.  It doesn’t always integrate well.  My biggest gripe is that I can’t send a text with it, so I end up using Siri, which defeats the whole purpose.  It does ok with Spotify, but will usually go to Amazon music first.  Overall I needs work.Edit:  It broke about 2 weeks in and it took 45 minutes and 4 transfers on chat to get a replacement.  Don’t bother, just use your phone.",1,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"Cannot provide location-based info. We could only get the device to provide word definitions. After updating everything in the app on my phone the device was incapable of providing traffic info, weather (even after specifying the city), etc. I thought it didn’t have an internet connection until I finally asked it what a cow was and it gave the definition.

It needs power so of course it needs a cable with today’s technology... it uses micro usb so I guess you can use a battery pack if you don’t want to connect to car accessory power.

If left plugged in, calls will go to your car when you are actually inside the house.  This happens when the car is in driveway or in the garage and I was several rooms away.  Too many cords.  One would think we have a way to have a wireless solution.  Concept is great.  Love being able to add to my shopping list or to do list.....lots of thinking time in the car.  Love being able to ask Alexa things to remain hands free.

I have a 2012 Toyota Camry XLE Hybrid. I plugged the Echo Auto into the USB port and got an error from the car that the device was using too power and disconnected it.  Then I connected it to the cigarette lighter charger and got the same error but then it did work.I left it plugged in for a day even when the car was not in use. I used it on my drive to a doctor’s appointment. When I got back to the car an hour later my car wouldn’t start.

The Auto Echo is fun to have in the car. I linked it through my phone and the kid and I play song quiz while we drive. It sometimes has difficulty hearing or understanding but it asks for reviews as you use it. Over all I enjoy being able to use the apps I have on Alexa in my car when I want to. It's small and easy to keep in the car.,5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
I was excited to get the echo so that I could control everything from one place. I have a 2016 car that hooks up to phone to make calls and can play audio. The echo will only make phone calls for me. It knows what I'm saying because I can see it in the history but it does not respond to me. It will only make phone calls which my car already does so that is not really beneficial to me. I was hoping to be able to talk and my audible books would play or get me directions and so forth. I can ask questions about the weather or ask for a joke and get no response.,1,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

"I purchased this Alexa for my auto. It was not difficult to install.Couple issues with the devise. First off it loses connection quite frequently. The connection does come back, but can take up to five minutes before it responds again. The other issue is the cord that connects the Alexa to your vehicle. I have a 2019 Lexus NX and my auxiliary plug is in the console by your arm. You have to plug one end into the console and the other end plugs into your Alexa devise which attaches to the air vent. This leaves the cord draped over the cup holders and gets in the way. I have to move the cord every time I use my cup holders.

When you can get it to stay connected, the sound is great and she responds to commands well. After about 3 weeks of this dropping out, back in the box it went. Glad I only paid $25 for it. The concept is great but the execution needs some work. I have never been disappointed in an Alexa device before so this was unexpected and frustrating.",1,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I like this item a lot, and I like the concept. However, Alexa on numerous times, does not understand commands, and what I am saying. She will do something completely different from what I asked, even when it is a command I have made before. She does not understand the difference between a ""B"" and a ""P"". When I ask her to play the latest episode of a Podcast, she will start to play a music playlist. The Echo device will not pick up my voice either. I guess the microphones are not strong enough. I never have my windows down, but there are many times where she will not hear the wake word.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
I was not pleased at all. I know thus is on beta but it’s just not ready for the public yet.

I will be watching for alternative mounting accessories. I sometimes have a long delay when Alexa is trying to establish a network connection. Eventually connects but sometimes takes up to a minute.

My car is older so I still have to connect with the AUX cable, but the product works great and it is fun to show off to friends. It's super easy to ask for directions and for music. My car is loud when on the freeway (because it's an older car) so sometimes trying to speak to it on the freeway is more difficult but I have never been too bothered by that especially considering that how much it upgrades my driving experience in general.

When I can’t connect to the app, which is 95% of the time, I just imagine what it would be like to really tap into its potential.  I stood in my garage the other day because I was connected to WiFi and had a little taste.  It was epic.  The app isn’t a complete disaster but it’s close.  Every single app on my phone works when I’m not connected to WiFi, except......you guessed it, the amazon Alexa app.  What a brilliant way to infuriate me further on my daily commute.

I have been a customer for a long time with Amazon and could not believe how unhelpful everyone was on the phone. I had to call back 6 times as every time i was told to stand by for help they just simply hung up. I was polite and tried to simply have a replacement as Amazon had clearly sent me a device that doesn't even turn on. Their service has very clearly gotten worse over time.

"It worked great as a standard BT audio receiver, but the software integration was a let it down. There were three areas I bought the device for. 1. Handsfree calling, the echo didn't find any contacts in my phone and I couldn't get ""call x name"" to work. (I read the forums and granted all the necessary permissions) 2. Navigation ""navigate to x place"" didn't work reliably. I would have expected it to send these commands to Google maps directly. Instead it used stored addresses in the Alexa app. 3. Play song and skip songs. This worked well, no complaints there. Overall I was bummed.

I like it so far and have used it in my 2007 silverado. It works well using the aux jack on my radio. My 12 volt power source stays on forever and does not turn off with the ignition switch. I must remember to unplug the unit when I leave my vehicle or it will stay on. If I lose the bluetooth connection then I must unplug the unit and plug it back in for it to reconnect. Overall its a good item though and would do fine in older vehicles with an aux port and no bluetooth connection. I have used it for phone calls as well and it worked well.,4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Pretty easy installation. Command recognition (time between “Alexa” and action command) seems a wee bit slower at first.  But either I got used to it (which is what I’m guessing), or it got better.  Connection is a wee bit slower than hoped for, but again, I think I’m getting used to it. Sometimes it can’t find Apple Music.  One time it couldn’t tell me the time, but could play a song from Amazon Music.  Go figure.  I use it mostly, right now, for “where’s the closest” whatever; play music; add stuff to my shopping list.  Main reason for buying is for future long trips, but am enjoying it for near home as well.

Were it not for this, I would have given the Echo Auto five stars.  Amazon really needs to fix this issue.",4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Works ok, but some of the lower than hoped for performance is due to where I placed it.I put it on the center console (where my USB port is located and since I didn’t want to route a cable nor have the cable hanging over my dash) and the reception/understanding is good as long as there isn’t too much road noise, even though it’s sitting directly below and a little to the side of my mouth.",3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

"Using a Note 8 with a Toyota Corolla.  The latency is pretty terrible. When time between dating the wake up word and the response you hear through the speakers is about 6 seconds.

You get used to it, but it doesn't really work the way I envisioned it.  I knew that there was going to be the 3 second delay,  but I hadn't anticipated the additional 3.

This is frustrating because as soon I get in my car and turn it on, I want Alexa to be responsive, but often it's faster if I just use my phone manually to setup my music or book or map.",3,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

It links to my phone very quickly every time I start the car, and performs about as well as a I thought it would. It's easy to hide the wires out of sight.Cons: Setup was a challenge - it was difficult to set it up via the Aux jack instead of bluetooth; I had to read some amazon forums on how to get it to work. Additionally, it can only link to one phone, so if my partner and I are both in the car, sometimes it links to her phone first. In that case I ask her to turn off bluetooth for a moment so it can link to mine, so we can listen to my spotify. Basically it can't link to two phones at once.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

It usually recognizes my voice well and responds just like the home version, but it occasionally seems not to hear me or  will light up blue but then not respond. I think it helped when I turn down the amount of air coming out of the vent. The Biggest drawback is that Bluetooth has to be on so if I want to listen to the car radio for instance, Alexa will not be ready.One time Alexa’s response was to “go to the Alexa app”.

Also, is seems to lag several iterations behind the phone software it’s supposed to work with. If I could give negative ratings I would.

So I have to say that I am a little disappointed with this. The Alexa portion does work as promised.  Meaning you can ask Alexa many things like you do from home.  But I had some issues because it doesn’t control the phone at all. So I couldn’t initiate calls on the phone through Alexa or reply to texts.

Ok since I got this thing first off it wouldn't answer me at all. I downloaded the alexa app and tried. It wouldn't answer to echo it wouldn't answer to echo auto and it still wouldn't answer to alexa. The radio in my truck isn't Bluetooth so I had to use the aux cord. Every time I asked something the light would come on like it was Thu king then no answer and it would turn off. Then I finally got it to work somehow and it can't hardly even hear me or understand what I'm saying. So 3 stars because it did find a station I really like on music when it did work alright.

It would be nice if Amazon fixed that and made this continue to work with paired Bluetooth devices even if they didn't have the Amazon/Alexa stuff installed. But it works.",4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"If you have an Amazon Echo at home, you'd think this would be all the same fun and functionality, except on the go. It's really not. Most of what this does I was already able to do through Siri, the few add on abilities Alexa does offer aren't enough to offset the things it CAN'T do. Why is Spotify not supported even though my Echo at home works fine with it and Amazon says Echo Auto supports it (it doesn't)? It's kind of fun to play games like Jeopardy or Screen Test in the car, but that's about it. I expected more. At the very least I expected the same that I've grown accustomed to at home. This device doesn't deliver. Novelty at best.",3,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

This was a total waste of money. The radio in my jeep does everything that Alexa does. Plus while using Alexa I have to leave it on the aux input. It would make sense to use in a much older vehicle that only has an input on the radio but using with any modern auto radio is ridiculous. I would not buy again and I would return if I still have the box and packaging. Don’t waste your time or money.

"I purchased to use the line in function to my vehicle and then allow me to connect to the device via Bluetooth for making calls. Audio is decent while I do get some interference through the audio cable being next to the power cable. Those in the other end of the call can barely hear me and if they do it is an extremely poor experience.  I speculate there is not enough shielding on the power cable and or auxiliary cable to prevent interference.  I can not use at all for calls, I use to stream podcasts over my car speakers with some buzz from the power interference. I haven’t even messed around with the Alexa integration yet, but the few times I looked and said her name it could not connect.",1,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
I asked for this as a grab bag Christmas gift from my husbands family. I got it.  Hooked it up and I love it.  I spend almost my whole drive to the grocery store adding items to my shopping list.  When I am driving and I remember that I have to do something and can't write it down I just ask Alexa to add it to my to do list.  It is the reason I wanted it was because when I drive my brain sometimes works overtime.  I need to get everything out of my head and onto paper...or Alexa takes care of it for me.  So far good sound and it is working in any temperature.  I clipped to my air vent on the left side of my steering wheel and closed that vent.  The chord hangs just under my steering wheel and doesn't hang in my way.  That was my preference for where I put it.  So far so good!,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0

I discovered this when I triggered the voice training feature. As it was instructing me on what to say, every time it says Alexa it would interrupt itself and start listening.Other things for example around location.

I have a 2008 Mercedes C300 and I love Alexa so i said why not put it in my car! (Keep me from looking at my phone while driving) now I feel like I am looking at my phone even more because the thing never works and it frustrates me and is never connected or never plays anything! Believe me when it works it's awesome but that's maybe 1 out of every 20 times. And even when it works theres a high pitched ringing sound that never goes away. Dont worry if that doesnt happen when you first have it it will slowly start to show up more and more.

To me Echo Auto is a solution waiting for a problem as it’s designed today.  I so much wanted to be able to use this in parallel to my existing audio system in the car.  As it’s designed is it has to integrate completely.  Would have been nice to control my Alexa enabled devices and services without that full integration.

This works great for music but unfortunately the bluetooth call quality sucks.  I'm hoping they can update it as this has the potential of being a great device.

There's no magnets here at all, so there's nothing from keeping it from just falling off on a hard turn or stop. Also, there's a rubber cord holder on the mount that I really like, BUT every time I go out to my car, the rubber holder has popped off and the cord is just freely hanging. The glue or whatever on the rubber doesn't stick so well. Maybe this should have been attached in a more permanent way. Otherwise, so far so good.

"Great idea, poor execution. I have already exchanged one unit and the second unit works about 40% of the time. My Alexa devices in my home work flawlessly. Pretty disappointed with Echo Auto.Update: I didn’t think it could get any worse. I sent the original unit back as a part of an exchange and they still charged me! It took me calling and providing a tracking number (which I had thankfully) and they did see they received the order and reversed the charge. Now, the newest unit continuously loses connection and consistently does not work at all!!!",1,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
I gave this as a gift to my brother who has all the Echo devices - but he said that the Echo Auto really did do much for him.  Yes - it could turn on his lights at home or change the temperature - but that was about it that he did already have with Siri.  Also - you have to have access to the internet so you have to use your hot spot all on your phone whenever you are in the car.,2,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

Saying Alexa, she doesn't respond half the time. Every other time starting the engine she works or doesn't work. Voice recognition is terrible. She stutters when she talks, and her voice skips. I'm so disappointed. And without Amazon acknowledging this #^%@, I'm afraid to not return it. If I knew they were going to fix all this, I may hold onto it. Shame on you Amazon.",1,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0

I do have a suggestion, however - allow us to change the ""Wake Word"" - I don't use ""Alexa"" on an of my other Amazon Echo devices and it is irritating to have to get used to a different Wake Word for the car.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"I love having Alexa in the car! I listen to my flash briefings, announce to my household when I'm coming home and listen to my playlists.  I can also drop in at home hands free.I do have problems with it staying connected to my bluetooth.  So it doesn't always stay connected.  I'm not sure if that's my car or the Alexa.  But when its working it's awesome.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"Alexa Auto is awesome. Sure the newer cars have alot of bells and whistles but nothing so personable as Alexa. Its like having a really smart friend riding with you that can answer questions that pop up while driving, memos & appts that you don't want to forget,  items you may wish to add to a grocery list or to even call someone while driving just by asking her to call them. The best part is that if you have an accident Alexa is there to help you get help and will stay with you until help arrives. This is a very valuable i item to have at your side when traveling,  she plays my favourite music either from iheart, pandora or Amazon music. You can train her as you need and that is awesome. Thanks Amazon for creating a ride along buddy, that's so helpful.",4,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
I didn't give the Alexa auto 5 stars because I had a bit of difficulty setting it up. Once I got it going I found that I really enjoy it. I have three Echo dots in the house so I am familiar with it. You can pretty much use it as you do in the home. I can ask it to play any music that I would like. It can tell you jokes or play games with you. It can tell you where the nearest gas stations are located. I might just cancel my SeriousXM and use the Alexa Auto for music.,4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"This is pretty awesome. Hands free Alexa in my car. I have an assortment of automated gadgets in my place and it is nice to turn them on from my car. Also great listening to Prime music.  Only issue I have had is syncing to my phone at times and the air vent mount is OK, but need something that will stay on better.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"I love my Echo Auto.  I waited and waited for the invite to buy, and when it finally came I was so excited.  I have to say I had a little issue getting it working the following day after setting it up, but it was total user error (I didn’t know I had to keep it on the Bluetooth screen vs. like Sirius in my Honda...I thought it would interrupt the radio but it will not).  I love being able to use it for weather, traffic, music, etc.  My 1st grader also loves that she can request her daily “theme song” to get pumped up on the way to school.  I have no complaints thus far.  I haven’t ventured too far from home yet but will on a road trip this weekend.  Fingers crossed that I will still have no complaints after we return.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Just got this, and after using it for an hour, I am very impressed. Works very well in my Hyundai Sonata and Samsung Note 8. Getting directions brings up Maps on my phone without touching a thing. Calls are a voice request away. Looking forward to seeing what else it can do.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"This this is fantastic. I drive a GMC terrain, and for whatever reason, they decided bluetooth would work for phone call but not audio - which is annoying.Picked up an echo auto and am back to streaming audiobooks in no time. It plugs into the AUX input and the sound quality is excellent. It reconnects every time I get in the car and I could not be happier.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"I use my car's auxiliary input to listen to audiobooks from my old iPod Shuffle. Phone calls automatically come in over bluetooth, but the Echo  Auto doesn't work that way. To use it, I have to pause my audiobook and manually switch from auxiliary to bluetooth on my car's system. This is at best, serviceable, and at worst VERY inconvenient.If you keep your system on bluetooth all the time, it will work ideally for you and I would highly recommend it, especially if you currently use an Echo at home.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"Talk about easy to set up!  It sets itself up!  Works perfectly - I can text, make calls, ask to play certain songs, weather, news....without taking my hands off the steering wheel.  When I receive a text, a yellow light flashes from Alexa until I've read it.  Driving at night it can get kind of irritating.  Other than that - love it.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"Loving Echo Auto in my vehicle!  The echo auto works great!! There isn’t a third party app the device connects to, just the Alexia app and then my phone. It works just like an in home Echo.  It’s so much safer to drive and utilize Alexia by voice commands. I can listen to my Amazon Music or my kindle unlimited books while I drive into work.  I didn’t  upload phone contacts, but I still my Bluetooth calls through my vehicle with no trouble at all.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"I used for at least 4 months, but telling it songs to play isn't as easy as you would think. She doesn't always recognize the voice or song or know the artist or song. Too frustrating to use, stopped paying for the service. Might just end up throwing it away as its more of a pain than changing the radio stations. Also kept falling off of the air vent",3,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
it's great for hands free aspect that my truck didn't have but I cant get it to give me turn by turn audible instructions mybe I'm not doing something right . Another thing is that the way its designed it's out in the open in plain sight from the outside. I have to remove it and hide it when I leave my truck. there needs to be an option to mount it someplace not so visible.,4,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I connected the echo auto in my 2017 Subaru Outback. For typical stuff like the weather, flash briefing, etc. it works fine. There is a bit of a delay after you say the wake word and that can throw you off a bit.If you have Amazon music or another music streaming service (and unlimited data) it works similarly to the original echo. If you do not have unlimited data like I do, I found some limitations. It does not appear to be able to find my downloaded Spotify playlists. Further, I found it was unable to sync my audible book to the furthest point, so going back and forth between my phone and the car was an irritation.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"My Son bought this for me, though I told him I didn’t need it! Well.....I LOVE IT!! I am definitely not bored driving, as I have Alexa to keep me company! You can listen to any kind of music, stories(podcasts), tell her to call someone, ask questions etc. etc. and probablythings I don’t even know it does! Absolutely love this!  Thanks Robby for not listening to me!",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"In general the product is still good but I had my first issue. One day I asked it a question and it answered and then it lost connection and I could not connect back. I tried to delete the device off the app, add it back and nothing. I had to reset it and add as if new, not a big deal but why was connection lost in first place. The process took about 15 min total time but I only worked on it for a 5 min here and min there.",4,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"Bought this in July 2019 and just love it!  Great to have Alexa on the road which is when I think of things to put on my shopping list or think of things I need to do when I get home (and will forget by the time I get there).  It's great to stream my books on long drives, get podcasts, etc.  Love, love, love!!!",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0

"It took a little setup, but once I had it up and running it worked perfectly. It was just like having an echo in my car. My car doesn't let me use Bluetooth for media playback, and my phone doesn't have a headphone jack, so this is the perfect way for me to be able to listen to my podcasts and music in the car.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"I have had this in my car for months now and feel I can leave a pretty well educated opinion.  The Echo Auto was very easy to setup and use.  I love the car mount for it as it stay out of the way.  The only issue I ever have is sometimes when I start the car to warm up, the Echo doesn't connect when I actually bring my phone in car and start to drive.  This is easily fixed by quickly unplugging then plugging the unit back in.  Otherwise, this is a great purchase and I plan on buying as gifts in the future.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I like Alexa and was thrilled to see it available for the vehicle.  It has it's own speaker when you're setting it up, but here is no way to use as a standalone Alexa without buying another speaker.  I like to listen to the radio or Sirius.  I very rarely use Pandora, Prime music or Spotify, so the Auto Echo essential is useless.  I'd prefer to have it available with its internal speaker and use it for other things than just music.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"It was working fine, until Tuesday.  Then it went offline.  Two hours spent trying to resolve, alone and with Amazon tech help.  Nothing.  Sent back for refund.  I also have the Roav version.  Consistently works MUCH better, and it’s wireless, plugs directly into your “cigarette lighter” and connects via Bluetooth.",1,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
We have a BMW i3 so installations was easy.  There is an extra power outlet under the dash so I plugged it in there and used picture hanger stickies to stick it upside down under the dash.  You can't even see any of it.  Every time we get into the car it pairs and we can listen to music.  Only a week in and only once did it say it was playing but nothing came out.  I think the volume might have been down as it hasn't happened again. A few times I had to say Alexa twice to wake her--but that could also be where I placed the unit.,4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Everything you love about Alexa in your house, in your car! Biggest drawback is that I have a “beacon“ in my car from my insurance company to get a discount for my safe driving. This beacon recognizes that I’m using my phone when the echo is running and my driving score decreases. Oh well. Not a deal breaker for me.",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
My phone has to be out to be able to use Alexa so it seems like the app on my phone is doing it and not the device also if you turn it off it mutes your phone.  I did not want my phone running through Alexa.  I had to completely disconnect it to use my phone (not through the device).  I’m not sure how I feel about it yet...  I wish it just accessed my hotspot and not use my phone,3,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"I have echo products all over my house so I thought why not in the car, I got it by invitation prior to general sale. Although I could always sync my phone to my car, this is much easier. I can just ask Alexa to read my book, play one of my playlists, turn on SiriusXM and many other things.I am truly pleased with my purchase.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"All the advertisements hyped up the product, but it did not live up to the hype. It's a great concept, but did not meet my expectations. I opened the product, threw away the box, expecting to have a great device. Connected it with my car, used for one song on Spotify, but quickly realized, what's the point of an echo auto? The device is bigger than expected as well and placement of the device is difficult if you don't have the correct vents recommended. Nice try on the Echo, but now it is sitting in a box in my trunk after one use.",2,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I love my Echo Auto! It extends and enhances the thing I used to be able to do on my iPhone, like play my favorite Spotify playlists hands free. It offers games for cranky kiddos. Plus I can drop in or make announcements on my home Echos and Dots with little effort or distraction while driving. My most favorite is that I can use my usual voice commands to control my smart home, like “Alexa, lock the front door”. It’s truly awesome if you spend any time in your car.",5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"You may wonder why you need Alexa in your car if you have a voice assistant on your phone. Put simply, the echo with Alexa works where others do not. Better in every way.

I am impressed with the Echo Auto.  I mainly use it to stream my digital content from the different streaming audio services I use.  It also does well with other things.  I don't find myself asking Echo Auto a lot of things.  Sometimes the weather and news.  I like it.  I will use it!  It works great with my 2012 CR-Z.,4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I was a little ify at first at what exactly an echo in the car could bring to the table but am actually surprisingly satisfied with having it. My car is a 2015 model and oddly doesnt have bluetooth capabilities, just usb and aux options which is what I had been using until adding the echo auto a few weeks ago. Prior to the auto my calls through the aux cable would leave people hearing themselves talking back, and now with the echo auto I dont. I do a ton of driving for work and love being able to tell her to play what music I want to hear, or to skip a song hands free. I also like that it works with my phone for GPS as it makes it easy to navigate while on the road. Over all I'm really satisfied and haven't even explored all the capabilities yet.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"Given a little time and refinement this will be an amazing feature to add to your car audio set up. When I can get it to connect & stay connected, it is the best add on feature I have ever put in my car. It does a surprisingly good job of picking up my voice over the sound of the Stereo system .it quickly and accurately plays what ever I request . The only issue I have experienced is getting it to connect & stay connected to my phone via the Alexa app. I'm sure in time Amazon will work out the connection issues.",3,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
Totally useless piece of crap.  It's not even heavy enough to use as a paperweight.  Doesn't do anything that my phone does.  retired to get support but app won't even accept my phonenumber!

"I got an early access invite so decided to try it - didn't last long before I returned it. Generally it worked fine but since you have to have the Alexa app running for this to work with my phone - why not just use the Alexa app? Good question and it's a lot of wires and added complexity for the small benefit of not needing to touch my phone. I'm an Alexa fan but in this case Hey Siri is much, much simpler.",2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Be patient! It took me a minute to understand that you have to switch to media to use it and it isn’t as instant (before switching) as at home but I love everything I can do with it while in the car, HANDS FREE (safety feature bonus)!! I have listen to books, found directions, listen to the news, got traffic updates, listen to my favorite playlist and even had her “tell me something good”! And as Alexa continues to get smarter, this is definitely worth the purchase!!",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"This did not connect easily, sound would not come out of speakers, could only play music that was available in a service, would not play music saved on phone.  Couldn't hear music out of radio, and not easy to set up.  I would return it if I could, but I took to long.  Alexa at home is cool, the car not so much.",1,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
I like this little thing. It does have some quirks to it. One time the device disconnected from my phone Alexa app and would not reconnect. Had to remove it and re add in the app. Sometimes it will light up when I say Alexa and immediately turn off so it will not hear my command. Trying to get the text messages read out is annoying so I don't use the feature at all. I also found calling with the Bluetooth system already in my car is better. I use echo auto to basically control my Spotify and control my smart home devices in my home to turn off a block away from my house.,4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"Waste of Money if you have anything other than an AM Radio in your car.When I pre-ordered this device, I assumed that it would work like a cell phone (i.e. interrupt whatever was playing when it needed to talk).

"I use mine in a 2011 Honda Pilot LX with my iPhone 6, connecting to my sound system through the aux input. The sound quality is very good through the car speakers, just like playing a CD. I primarily use it for my Amazon Music playlist and Audible books, but I also really like the access to the Alexa AI when I'm out and about.  The only reason I give it only four stars is the need for doubling up cables to my cigarette lighter socket.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
Found that the device did not live up to all the hype and the year long wait for my invitation to be accepted didn't help either. There are no turn by turn voice directions when using navigation and the device is not indicating I have messages waiting with the green light like on other echo devices.

I was told that the auto echo would read my kindle books. It will only read Audible books. That is not what I wantd.

It also want Bluetooth to my phone and read my gps. Not a happy customer.,2,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Tge noise suppression of the cabin isn’t as smooth as I would have expected - and it’s noisy enough so the Echo doesn’t pick up it’s wake word at all times. The sound quality isn’t great, and the mounting seems a bit delicate - though it does keep on. Almost times it takes quite a bit of time to get a hold of the phone connection - so it’s a long wait between ignition and when it is ready to respond.",2,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
This thing is an absolute piece of garbage.  It never stays connected and I didn’t want to waste my time trying to get it to connect every time I get in the car.

"This works though your car radio auxilary speaker, so if a movie is playing in the backseat, there is no way to use Alexa.  Alexa also has often had thouble connecting to my phone bluetooth, so using it has been a bit spotty, but overall having hands free music on demand has been nice, as well as the ability to aff to my shopping list or set reminders while on the go is handy.",4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Once setup, using your own phone for internet service, opening up the Alexa app, then the app works as it should. I lost the connection on many occasions due to poor cell service.

You have to re-establish several times but once it’s working, the music etc continues without interruption.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
I really like the portability of this version of Alexa.  It fits easily into my purse so no worry about someone stealing it from the car.  I would like to see an enhancement with some sort of internal battery incorporated into the unit so there isn't so much plugging in the cord for short trips.  Echo auto is  easy to pair and lets you enjoy your Amazon music away from home.,5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0

"Couple of issues- for my car, it is much less advanced than the car tech- so it just interferes with the car’s normal car play function. The number one use I was hoping for was asking Alexa to play Spotify music in addition to normal questions- but it doesn’t link to Spotify directly like Alexa home would. I gave it to my husband instead to use in his Silverado which doesn’t have hands free and would be perfect- but it won’t connect to Bluetooth. He hasn’t hooked it in manually yet.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
I got this sent to me before they went on sale to the public. I hate that my car has to be on the bluetooth setting to use it. I also don't find it as functional as I thought I would have.

"I purchased the product expecting it to perform similarly to the ones I have in my house, but the echo auto hasn't worked nearly as well. I used it in a2013 CR-V. The piece which holds the echo auto kept falling when I went over bumps. It had difficulty hearing my voice. When I ask a question, it doesn't respond back to confirm the question or command. There should be more instructions telling what to expect, At this point it doesn't do anything I couldn't do myself... adjust volume, change song, tell the time. I think it still needs improvement, or I do",2,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"This product is a boof Alexa product. All of the features you'd like to rely on never work because Alexa can't ever connect to you phone's cell service.

But don't think you can even say ""Alexa, find me a gas station,"" because she'll hit you with some long response of how she can't connect to your phone and you will want to drive yourself off the road in anger.

The voice cutting out is the most frustrating thing as you can only hear part of its answer to your question.

Does not live up to the rest of the echo line.  I have 8 echo devices and this one just behaves differently in the interface.  I don’t want to figure out how to interact differently with this device.  I got it to keep my hands on the steering wheel and mind on the road.

In addition, forgive you if you ask it something useful like directions... it asks you to enable such service on your phone - which you should not do while driving and by the way, doesn't even show up on the phone...

Honestly having the echo auto has made my echos in home more useful, I now use them more than I used to. I have had to reboot it a few times in the week or so I’ve had it. It will get to a point where it won’t stream the music and I have to unplug it then plug it back in and it will work as it’s suppose to again.

"Though it’s a neat concept, it is nothing more than what your phone can do, it takes up room in your car and takes up the plugs for essentially nothing, I got it for free so I’m not complaining but there is really no use for it where I live because you need to have cell phone service to connect it through your Bluetooth in which it’s bad in my area so unless it’s free I would pass on this purchase",4,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"I'm pretty happy with this. I got this for my 2015 Toyota Camry because the car cannot call people using voice prompts.  Originally I was disappointed about a couple of things. First, the 2015 Toyota Camry is listed as one of the cars that the bluetooth doesn't work for audio, so I thought I'd have to use the auxiliary connection. I don't know if it's because my Camry is the sport version, but I can use echo auto without the aux cable. Second, Alexa originally did not work when I asked it to make phone calls. It would just say it couldn't do that whenever I asked. I don't know if amazon updated it, but the calling works now. Other than calls, I primarily use it to play music which works well with amazon prime.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"Overall not impressed. Every time I ask for the news it says talk time isn't available. There is to long of a wait for the beep and for you to give instructions. The component that holds the hold has fallen off several times and it's sticky anymore so the cord just hangs down. The whole thing, holder and Alexia just pooped off the vent the other day when I was driving.",3,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"YES!!!  Definitely worth buying!!  Overall very, very good product that’s almost perfect.  It has the occasional (maybe 1 out of 20 times) where it doesn’t connect immediately (but eventually does within a few seconds or minutes).  It’s identical to the echo at home with a slightly diminished hearing capacity.  You have to say “ALEXA” clearly and audibly or else it obviously can’t hear you well.  Other than that I LOVE IT!! I’m sure there will be amazing ALEXA skills coming out that will eventually integrate perfectly.  I love it for music, to find out where the nearest restaurants are and to set alarms, reminders, ask random questions about anything.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"The worst sound quality. Unbelievably disappointed is an understatement. I have an incredible Harmon Kardon Dolby Logic 7 system in my Mercedes that I used the Amazon Echo Auto in and it somehow changes the signal input and outputs pure garbage. I’ve listened to the same song on the Echo’s Bluetooth vs MB Bluetooth using both Tidal HQ & Pandora HQ settings it’s night and day difference. The low tones are completely flat and highs are muted, giving you a very cheap and distorted sound.",1,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"I was really excited for this product but ended up disappointed. If you want to use the Echo with Amazon supported or preferred apps, it will probably be a good fit for you. However, when using with other apps like Spotify or Waze, the experience was lackluster. The Echo wasn't even able to play music from my liked songs on Spotify, or my favorited locations on Waze. I also found it pointless that the Echo makes you tap a pop-up on your phone screen in order to complete certain commands. The whole point of this product is to be hands-free in your car. Echo Auto needs some work before I consider purchasing again.",3,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0

"It took a little while to figure out how to get it set up.  Instructions were fine; just a new thing for me.  It gives me control over my home when I'm away, which I like a lot.  Interaction with the Sirius/XM works well, particularly because I live in the mountains, so I lose a satellite connection but still have 4G.

"This thing is a great way to upgrade an older system!! I use the Aux cable in one vehicle, and the FM->Bluetooth transmitter in another. Works great both ways.My ONLY complaint is the vent clip. It sorta works, but it would be really nice if Amazon provided a magnet to hook it to the dash directly. I tried an after market magnet and it just didn’t fit well.

"Electronic devices are not meant to be left in the car all summer, in the heat, and all winter, in the cold. Had it for less than a year and it wont even power on any more.

Will not replace, unless Amazon wants to send a free replacement. I will just use a bluetooth adapter and play my music through that. That has worked for years with no issue. I thought the Echo Auto would have been nice to use voice control but the road noise just means I need to yell at the thing.

I like that all of my Amazon Music and integration is with me.  It seems to loose connectivity more than I thought and we have 2 - one in each vehicle mine and hers and not easy to switch vehicles without some settings being changed.

I love this product but unfortunately it doesn't connect as well as I would hope to the phone when entering the car.

This was real easy to configure but I just do not really like the form factor and still not decided on my permanent mounting position.  Also I am not finding that I use it as much as I expected.

Removable usb cable would be better and should have the option to attach it to either left or right side of the echo auto for flexibility.",4,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0

If you already have an Alexa in your home then you are going to love this for your car.  It works the same way and installation is nothing but plugging it into your car charger!  The only thing that I can say negative about this device is that it occasionally has a hard time connecting via blue tooth to my phone.  But this is very occasionally. Very much worth it if you enjoy your home Alexa as much as I do.  You can make & receive phone calls and texts via your Alexa mount and have her read your texts to you.,5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
Voice recognition with certain words are hit and miss especially with the game feature.  I gave overall the product a 3 because I paid 49.99 for it and I see it will be on sale for $25.  I wouldn't pay the nearly $50 again for it if I had to do all over again.

If I forget to turn the Bluetooth off when I get out of the car, it is like my phone is on silent. The sounds is still connected to the auxiliary in the car.

I will look forward to purchasing a car in the future that has Alexa functionality built-in and can be assured it works appropriately.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
Works great! This was a gift and I love it! I find that leaving it hooked up is easier for it to reconnect the next time I get in the car. It also has a really good range.

For the most part I like the Echo Auto. Its convenient when your driving to request any music from Amazon music. I had also got this for hands free texting.

"Vehicle: 2017 Chevrolet Silv 1500I was first excited to be invited to purchase this product early and get a chance to play around with it.  I was not happy with how the setup turned out to be in the vehicle, and the options I had.  Being tied to the phone, why no just use your phone instead?  If this could be a completely independent device in certain situations (Truck has built in wifi) or not so complicated logging into Alexa on your phone it would have been much better.  I do not have much to say as it was a short lived experiment, but maybe next time Amazon?  Maybe roll out an updated setup that works with Android Auto?",2,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"Not impressed. Integration is not consistent, somes connects to car, sometimes I need to restart everything. Also, voice recognition is poor.

Love this addition to my Jeep.  The only problem I have is when I start to leave my house and I start to get out of range from the home WiFi.

It is pretty cool to take Alexa in the car with you. I love to call out the songs I like to listen to when I drive so I gave it a try. So far so good. Pretty easy install. I bought iron black Friday so the cost was minimal. If you pay for Amazon music service it is definitely worth to have in your car.,5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"I have the echo dot devices in my house and love using them so I bought this one for my car. I have a car that does not have Bluetooth built in and I would have to plug my phone in through an aux cable if I wanted to listen to my music when driving or use a headset if I had a phone call. It is great to be able to use voice features on the echo auto to make and receive calls and to play my music.

Overall I am very happy with this purchase and do recommend.,5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
Definitely not worth your time. I was excited for this but it is pretty bad.

There should have been more R&D done before this was released. It’s horrible. I have everything AlexA but I do not even use this thing. 1. You HAVE to use a wire if you want it to work. I’m not a fan of having wires in plain view. 2. Unless you are in auxiliary mode the sound won’t come out of your car speakers.

We have many Echo products in our home and have enjoyed them for many years. I was excited to get the echo auto but must admit it’s performance is not very good. Voice recognition is poor and it often has difficulty “connecting” to services; that is many times it acknowledges my commands with a tone but then doesn’t do anything. I was selected to receive this early and only paid $25. Sadly it’s not even worth that. I’m hoping that updates will improve its performance but until then I’ve disconnected it - far too frustrating to use as is.,2,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
This is the first time I've not had a 5 Star experience with an Amazon Echo product. I set it up in my vehicle with the help of two marvelous Alexa customer support folks about a week ago. I find it very frustrating that Alexa has to search for my phone connection 90% of the time. It takes a while and I'm considering returning the product.,3,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

I was so excited that they finally came out with an alexa for your car. Unfortunately for me my car and phone both do the same thing that the alexa auto does and you have to connect it to your bluetooth so it just drains your battery.

I waited 7 months for an invitation to buy this at a lower price.  I am very disappointed that the hype didn’t live up to this product.  It was extremely difficult to get it connected to my BMW 328i. After I finally got it connected it always tells me that it doesn’t have an internet connection when I try to use it with Amazon music.  Useless product!,2,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"It works for the most part. Does everything an Echo does but in the car. The only problem is that it can never hear what is being said. I have to repeat myself multiple times just to get it to register. I don't know if it is because of location but Amazon boasting about the tons of microphones on it, it should matter that it's 2 feet away opposed to 1 foot away. It mostly gets unused now as it's easier just to do what I need to do with the Alexa app before I start driving or after I start driving. It seems like a good idea in theory but in practice it ends up falling short.",2,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"Great product but is somewhat difficult to pair. I have to get my wife to set up. I tried taking it off my phone so my wife could use it and it wouldn’t work for her.

"Disconnects regularly. I’ve reinstalled this a few times but it continues to disconnect. When it’s connected, it’s great, but it doesn’t make anything easier because it keeps disconnecting.

Waste of time and money. I am on my second device after returning the first defective device.  Th ed second device has more problems than the first.

But it's not consistent, so it's very frustrating and dangerous trying to figure out how to get the speaker to work correctly.  But when it does work, it's great.

I WANTED TO LOVE THIS LIKE I DO THE REST OF THE ECHO LINE BUT ITS HORRIBLE.  SELDOM DOES WHAT I ASK.  STOPS WORKING IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG.  TO MANY CORDS AND TO SHORT.

It has worked well with playing music for us.  The only issue that I have had which I think is more with my phone than with the Echo Auto is it connecting to my phone when I first get in the car takes awhile.

I don’t recall where I read this but it does take some time for it to switch networks. For example, pulling out of your garage takes a few minutes depending on your signal strength of course. Just ask her again and it’s flawless. Sound?  Kicks the crap out of my Pioneer in my truck.  Make sure to get Amazon Music HD.

Also, my dash was getting messy with more wires draped on it.",3,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
No one needs this. It connects to you phone and then connects to the car. Just kill the middle man and connect your phone to your car. Done!

"I am a huge fan of using Alexa and my entire apartment is smart controlled with Echo units. I was over the moon about the idea of an auto integration, even with the understanding it would be based on my data plan on my mobile. The unit has a ways to go when it comes to voice control. Currently my unit struggles with understanding commands and often doesn't respond at all. However I do love it as my car (2009 Honda Fit) does not have bluetooth integrated so this device has changed my driving just with the fact I have a bluetooth connected speaker for calls, music and map directions. It really has made a huge difference.I went with 3 stars because I do really like the unit, I just don't think it's quite living up to the other echo units in doing exactly what one might expect from Alexa.",3,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"Absolutely love it.....took some time to connect with Bluetooth, but it seems much better than when I first installed it...a trick I use is to turn off Bluetooth on my phone when I get in my truck, then get down the street away from other Bluetooth devices in my home, turn Bluetooth back on and it works perfectly....I was going to install a  new stereo system,, but not needed now",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
I have an old corvette that doesn’t have any of the modern electronics of today’s cars. The auto echo works great to bring some of those features to an old car.

"Still a little buggy. Does not always connect when getting into vehicle. I mostly use it to play my music library. Does not always take command to play, often stops playing despite having a good wifi/bluetooth connection. Great idea and hope it gets better with updates. Great price at $25. Not so sure it would be a good deal at $50. If you can add Alexa App to your vehicle this device is not needed. Note that the Ford-Alexa app is very buggy as well.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"I got the invite to purchase early before it was released to everyone. It was a great price too - cheaper than the price now.  We were so excited to have the auto echo since we have been very happy with our 3 echos at home.  Sadly, this does not work well.  It is a hit or miss in recognizing your voice, half the time it does nothing.  I returned it because it became a hazard on the road and very annoying that it does not work.",1,1,2019-10-11,1,1,0

I first put this into my 2012 Peterbillt truck. There is just too much road noise in this vehicle to have this work properly. Now I have it in my 2008 Chevy pick up. It is nice for a handsfree calling system since the truck is older and doesn't have Bluetooth. With that being said I also need to have both cables (power/audio) hooked up. That's a little annoying. My other slight disappointment is that my iPhone 7 seems to not connect seamlessly with the Echo Auto like it does with all my other Bluetooth devices. Those are just my opinions and components I am working with.,3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"This product is a cool idea but I am not as impressed as I hoped I’d be. The issue is the connection is horrible to where the sound goes in and out or speeds up the music to where it sounds like a 33rpm record is being played at 75. I think this item would be ok for like $20 but it’s got a lot of issues to be selling at $50. At the end of the day this does what your phone already does.

I love pairing this with amazon music and dropping satellite radio. It works well to communicate with various items throughout my house.

I mainly got it so that I could connect my phone to the Bluetooth and stop getting the phone cord hung on stuff. Well, I was pleasantly surprised, Alexa can hear my voice while I’m going down he highway at 60 mph. I was shocked especially since I haven’t even mounted it yet.

So I purchased this with hopes of how my echo works at home.  Not very impressed.  First off the vent clip takes up a lot of space.  She doesn't always connect just seems poorly designed.  I have figured it is just as easy to connect Amazon music with my phone.  You just can't talk to it that is the only down side but I hope that they get the bugs worked out and maybe think of other ways to mount it other than the vent clip.

I love the convenience of having Alexa in my car so I can listen to podcasts and other streaming material when in my car.  I can even check and set the thermostats in my home!",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I like the hands free capabilities of using the Echo Auto but it will only play my Amazon music. I ask it to play anything else such as Apple Music, Pandora, etc., it says its not compatible with this device. This is not how Amazon advertises this product. I love all my other Alexa devices but this one missed the mark.",3,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"This Alexa device unfortunately does not pick up voice well, I was looking forward to it for over a year and it was a huge disappointment. It disconnects frequently and reconnects and Bluetooth is not always working. The holder you attach to the vent  it came with doesn’t even stay on and it keeps falling off.I don’t recommend this product, hopefully they upgrade it to its potential",2,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
I love Alexa product my home is run by Alexa. My TV my Lights My music Alexa everywhere. I do have to say I am very disappointed with Alexa Auto. Sound quality is bad connectivity not great and really doesn’t do much. The only thing I like about it is I turn my lights on in my home when I’m pulling up to the house. Other than that it was a waist of money. I was even on the list of invitations to receive early. I guess my anticipation was good. Save your money and go into the App to turn your lights on.,2,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"I love how the Echo Auto makes everything hands free, Alexa does almost everything I need her to do. If I have the windows down, Alexa has a hard time hearing my voice sometimes. The sound quality gets garbled sometimes on the music, but I haven’t figured out if that’s my speakers or Alexa. The only that I can’t do at this point is send text messages, again not sure if that’s on the Echo or my carrier. All in all, I am very pleased with purchasing the Echo Auto, and will most likely be ordering another for my husband’s and kid’s vehicles.",4,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"very cool. I love the ones in my home so I thought why not. It does seem to loose connection sometimes (not too often), but it keeps trying and pops back on. I love creating road trip playlists for different occasions. Quite fun for a group. Take turns asking Alexa to play YOUR favorite songs.",4,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"Not sure why all the negative reviews. My Echo Auto works great with my car and Android phone. I need to turn the volume up more.....but once I do it's great. I'm ditching Sirius since I now have Amazon music. As a housewife, I also LOVE being able to add to my to do and shopping list or check it from the car. Soooooooooooo excited to have Alexa in my car with me!!!!",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"So I was lucky enough too get this a few months ago. Amazon had an exclusive sale. This add on to my car is amazing, understands me clearly, great add on to android auto.

"I wanted to give five stars. Overall I really like this addition to our vehicle. It allows me to accomplish alot of things hand free. I will have not been able to fully use this for basic navigation. I actually have to pull over, pick up my phone to enable, and also lie and tell it I'm a passenger so it will help me. Fix this issue and I would give it all five stars.",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
Love the car auto. I can control our alarm system and lights for the house from inside the car. Also it great for playing songs and playlists in my car...hands free. I love getting my morning weather and the kids love asking her questions in the car. I have an older 2008 car and it was only able to make phone calls...now I’m able to do so much more.,5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
Honestly i love My alexa dot and show in the house especially when connected to my ring doorbell. I thought the car version would be as easy but i do not find it is. I have to manually change my cars Bluetooth to this device every time plus it doesn’t listen or answer nearly as well as the home devices. I’m disappointed.,2,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I love my home Alexa and do enjoy this auto model, as well, but find the necessity of a good cell signal a bit of a put off.  I can be listening to my favorite music and suddenly lose it due to loss of cell signal.  However since the Auto Alexa can turn on and off the lights at home when I'm away, I still find this Alexa really, really handy.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
Not sure why others have a problem.  My guess is the age of the electronic devices they are using.  I have had no problems.  I have an Apple iPhone XS and a 2017 Subaru Impreza.  Followed the instructions.  Downloaded the Alexa app on my phone.  Connected to radio with Bluetooth.  Immediately starting using it.  Voice recognition is good but not perfect.  And sound quality during voice commands is occasionally low volume.  But overall I think the Echo Auto is very good.  I got it to stream music when the radio isn't matching my taste at that moment.  Works for me.,4,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
Why this insists on working through your car stereo system even though it has a mic and speaker is baffling.Complete waste of money.,1,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
I only gave this product four stars because I couldn't get the line input to work even after a reset but my vehicle has BlueTooth even though the sound isn't as good as the line in. Also when I use the echo in my vehicle the echo's in my house go off defeating the guard feature skill. Not cool.,4,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"This echo auto works great.  Easy setup and great voice recognition!  I have been thinking about buying my wife a new bluetooth enabled stereo for a while but this little device just turned her existing radio into bluetooth enabled and even better hand free.  Fantastic product, I highly recommend it!",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"THE ECHO AUTO FILLED MY GAP TO MY AMAZON APPS AND ENTERTAINMENT SELECTION. IT WORKS AS GOOD AS MY HOME ECHO PRODUCTS.

"The Alexa can only be used with the car phone and the car media option. So to use Alexa, I need to set my car to media to hear the information.  There should be an option where Alexa could use the phone or the Alexa speakers instead of the car audio.  Also, Alexa should have a rechargeable battery in it since when the car has the stop / start function, it loses the phone connection, makes sounds and is not available.  By having a rechargeable battery, it wouldn't have the issue.",2,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

"Very easy to set up! I enjoy the little ding that it plays when it first connects. I originally had it connected to a constant power source even when my car was off, but that created a big problem when I was near my car talking on the phone or listening to music as the echo auto kept taking the audio, so I contracted the power to a source that is on only when the car is on.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"I rarely do any product review but felt strongly that I need to do this. This product is simply put...""terrible"". The voice recognition is spotty at best, the sound quality is totally related to your speaker system and it adds nothing that my phone, Bluetooth, and car system doesn't already have. In addition it totally disrupts my message and call notification....I disconnected it and threw it in the glove box.",1,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
"When this works, it’s great...unfortunately, it frequently loses the cell signal and is unusable at those times...even when I show bars of service it’s often not enough.

"It takes a long time for the Echo Auto to initially connect when starting a drive.  The only way to avoid this is to manually open the Alexa app on the phone when getting into the car.  I use Spotify.  Changing songs was quicker when I did not use the Echo.  The Echo has an annoying delay.  The one thing I do like about the Echo is being able to have Alexa dial anyone in my contacts. I was very excited to get a Echo Auto but I am a bit disappointed.  Other than changing Spotify playlists, I don't find it very useful.  I also dislike the mount that it comes with causing it to stick out of an air vent.  The Echo is small flat item.  It would be nicer if it could be placed flat on top of the dash.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"The integration of the device with hands free audio is a bit tricky. There were lots of settings on the Alexa App that I had to change to make it work well. For a device like this, it would be nice to have a voice command driven strategy to adjust settings and enable different features. Overall, it works well for a smaller, older car that doesn't have a navigation or built in handsfree capabilities.",4,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"I've been using the Echo Auto since the early shipments and have been happy with its general operation. The only issues that I have are some delays in communication between the device and phone (not sure whether it's an Auto thing or not) and a frustration that when cell coverage drops, there isn't quicker feedback - it sometimes causes me to glance at the phone to see if I've lost connection, and I hate doing that.",4,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
Horrible.  Not like how it operates on tv ad with State Farm.  Every time it loses Bluetooth connection to the phone.  This device is useless just an extra thing taking up space.  Wire hanging to keep charge.  Why is it that dumb for Amazon R&D to just make the bear as possible device making it rechargeable so no wire has to plug into usb to charge.,1,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"You have to start the Alexa auto once each day MANUALLY using your phone. It ends up being faster to just play your music over Bluetooth vs. fighting to get Alexa auto running. Not helpful for music, or directions. It is a novelty and no where near as good as having an Amazon echo. The Alexa auto is cheap and you definitely get what you pay for- not. much.",1,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0

"This is a great package and a great idea if you can get it to work.  I have experienced several issues with connectivity.  Once she looses an internet connection, she will not reacquire it until a complete power down and restart. I can see this is acceptable if you stationary, but as a mobile application, it lacks the stability to be a useful tool.  additionally, the glue that holds the wire manager to the vent mount keeps melting and the rubber do hickey keeps dropping off.I have only been able to get bout 40% reliability of the  unit and have better luck with Siri directly.  Sorry Jeff, this one needs some more work...",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"After reading some reviews I wasn’t sure it is worth it, but whom ever wrote the bad reviews knows nothing about simple installation.

"I have a 2015 Ford Taurus and this was a welcome addition to my vehicle! I purchased it months ago, but just got around to installing it. It was a snap to set up with the optional vent clip. It’s helpful to have previous Alexa experience when using this device, but not required. I find this to be easier to use than the voice controls with the Ford Sync system and I love the integration with my Apple Music playlists. All in all I’m very satisfied and intrigued by everything it can do!",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0

"Alexa? Alleeexxa? Are you there?I get lots of passenger giggles pleading with this novelty product to play some music. Eventually she blings, takes a thoughtful pause, arranges her thoughts, and may deign to let your phone play through the car radio from its default music provider.

"Great addition to the echo family.  Set up was easy and it functions well.  When starting the car it has to be woken up to reconnect with your phone, but does so pretty quickly.  My only complaint is that my phone will stay paired to the echo audio long after I've parked the car in the garage, so long as I stay in range.  I often won't discover this until I try to listen to something and have no audio.  Great for playing music, audible, taking calls, getting directions, or random questions for Alexa.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Bought it on July 7, 2019, via invitation. Didn't get the vent mount and they want me to pay $14.95 more for it.....no way. Uses way too much cell phone data.
