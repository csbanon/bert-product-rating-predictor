"I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the “Try Alexa” suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can’t recommend it and will not be buying addition units.Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update.",2,1,2019-11-26,1,1,1
"I had the echo 5 and I can't stand the ""try Alexa"" phrases at the bottom. From all the reviews I read on the 5 I wasn't the only one. I hope Amazon realized that people didn't like this. I will be returning this. At least make it a option.",1,1,2019-11-25,1,1,1
"Aaaaaaaggghhh!  The ""Things to Try"" sayings are sooooooooo annoying.  And they are so stupid and do not pertain to me at all.  ""Alexa, how do you say hello in German?"", ""Alexa, rap for me."", ""Alexa, how hot is the sun?"", ""Alexa, what's the temperature on the North Pole?"", blah, blah, blah.  They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.  And the clock is so small in the upper left corner, that you have to be right on top of it to read it.  I couldn't take it any more and had to return my new Echo Show 8.",1,1,2019-11-26,1,1,0
I have had an Echo Show 5 for over a month in my work office and like it a great deal. I ESPECIALLY like the ability to customize the clock.I received the new Echo Show 8 as a gift this past weekend and like it for most of the same reasons I like the Echo Show 5: great connectivity; good diversity of content and skills; and great as a sound speaker and photo display.,4,1,2019-11-26,1,1,0
"I received my new Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa a couple hours ago. I had it unpacked and connected to my WIFI within 30 minutes. I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front & back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,7,0
I have a bunch of Echo devices in my home. Including the Echo show  2 10 inch.I feel like this is the best bargain at current prices.,5,1,2019-11-26,1,5,0
"This is my first Echo device.  Had already set up several skills on the Alexa app before the Echo Show 8 arrived, so I was ready for it; and had my expectations already set as to the quality of the response to the voice commands.  If you are considering entering the Echo 'echo-system' and are on the fence about getting one of these, try downloading the Alexa app to your phone or tablet and try it out.  On the phone app (iPhone and iPad in my case), a button push activates Alexa; with the Show 8, just say her name and she starts listening.Some of the Alexa skills still need some work, and your satisfaction with them may vary.  But for the Show 8, it's great!  The speakers sound better than  I expected (actually are pretty awesome compared to the Show's size) and will fill the room with sound.  The Show 8 has an external speaker jack on the back, but I don't see ever using it - the internal speakers are THAT good - can feel the bass from the speakers vibrating the kitchen countertop.  With the speakers in the rear, having it backed up close to a wall provides the best sound projection and quality.  A similar concept to some higher end Bose speakers, which have rear-firing elements that are designed to reflect the sound off of a wall and provide more ambience.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,3,1
"I love the way I can control Home Automation with Alexa. Was so excited to get the echo show 8, as my first echo screen unit. But as soon I powered it on, first thing I can see is the backlight bleeding so much. Is this normal to have that much, or did I got a bad unit? Anyway I thought it would be ok as you can see much when there is a brighter picture in it. But when it got inactive, I’ll have only a clock and a black screen full with backlight bleed. Will contact Amazon and see if it’s normal or if I can get a replacement.——",1,1,2019-11-26,1,1,1
"We keep the Amazon Show 8 in our kitchen, and the whole family enjoys using it. Display is perfect size on the kitchen counter. We enjoy playing music (sounds great) and of course, we enjoy asking Alexa for the temperature or the weather forecast, and asking basically any question you can think of. Recipe feature is excellent too!",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"I wrongly assumed that this new improved Echo Show would offer a way to turn off the absolutely annoying ""Things to Try.""  I was wrong.  Until they come up with a way of turning it off, I can't give a good review to this product or to any other Echo with a screen (Show, Spot).  I would put an Echo Show 8 in every room if they would allow me to kill the Things to Try.",1,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
"Bought this instead of replacing my defunct electronic picture frame. Now I stream pictures from amazon photos and they look great on this screen. It's in the kitchen so great for using for the radio or internet but I'm finding the more I play with this, the more useful it is. I have Sonos speakers all over the house and can control them with a skill, which is great. But, the sound on this little baby i nearly there with the sound from the Sonos one, which i pretty impressive, loud and no distortion.Alexa has some pretty impressive capabilities and one of them is keeping my kids entertained. We already had an echo dot before this but now we are starting to communicate around the house with Alexa.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,2,1
I bought this to take the spot of my Show 5 in my bedroom.  With the Show 5 I could barely read the clock face across the room and there is no option to make the clock take up the entire screen.I figured 3 extra inches from the Show 8 would make the clock big enough to see.  Imagine my surprise when I found it is impossible to customize the clock face in Show 8 settings.  The closest I came to what I need is a dark screen with a tiny clock in the bottom left corner.  What is the point in that?,3,1,2019-11-26,1,2,0
"A quality made product, however, if you don’t want to have the phrase:  “Try, Alexa..”. over your photos in a giant font don’t buy this product.  You are stuck with almost fullscreen print over your home screen and are not able to modify in the settings.  I called customer service and they told me it’s how it is.  I’m gonna keep mine though.  If you want to view full screen photos without amazon marketing over at least 1/3 and often more than 1/3 of the screen you need to verbally tell Alexa every time you use it to display photos.  Apple are more expensive for a reason because the end user is not forced into how to customize the product.  One does get used to it a little but then it ends up coming full screen printed font over your favorite photo and it reminds you why amazon sells you the product for so little.Dear Amazon, please let the users change be homescreen settings to not include the Alexa suggestions, and also please do not contact me regarding this revied.  Change the firmware and then I will pull down the review.",3,1,2019-12-8,1,2,0
"There are many things I like about this. However, 1 major thing is such a significant drawback that I feel weighs all the otherwise positive aspects out. That is, the constant, “Try Alexa,........” at the bottom of the home screen. It cant be turned off and it incredibly annoying.  It also seems to be something that has been around for past generations and I am absolutely baffled as to why.",3,1,2019-11-26,1,2,0
"Can't stand the ""try"" pop ups at the bottom of the screen. I really don't give a rat's whatever about Leonardo DiCaprio movies or Whole Foods deals! Plus the clock is way too small and there's no way to enlarge it except to put the device in ""do not disturb"" mode. Then the clock is only slightly bigger. I wanted to like this.It's going back to Amazon.",1,1,2019-12-2,1,2,0
"I really can’t understand why Amazon won’t allow people to turn off the things to try message.  We have a fairly comprehensive Alexa network of devices and this is my major pain point.  It’s ridiculous.  I debated rating it higher, but i don’t think amazon will get the message unless customers speak loud enough.",1,1,2019-12-7,1,2,0

I like everything about this except for two things. You need the option to make the clock bigger if needed and be able to see the day's date.  Hopefully they will fix this in an update and if they do it would be a 5 star rating for me.,4,1,2019-11-26,1,2,0
"Amazon had produced some great Echo show devices but they still haven't grasped the idea of how to make this the optimal user experience.My first Echo Show was the original 5"" model introduced in 2017.  I was one of the first to purchase this and three years later, it still performs admirably.",3,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"This is crazy! I bought this device for my wive for the kitchen so she can watch her christian show on the internet. The Echo Show 8 always turns the feed off and switches back to the clock display after 5 minutes. You literally have to touch the screen every 30 seconds to stop it from happening. Ridiculous! The forums are saying that Amazon wants to force people to stay on their content - Prime Video where this doesn't happen.  I don’t want to watch prime video. welcome to a new era of useless computers, censorship built in!! If we don’t speak out now, not sure how this world will end up!",1,1,2020-1-23,1,1,0
"I got this primarily to use as a digital picture frame in my living room and it does a great job of scrolling thru my pictures and they display beautifully.  However, it puts the annoying things to try at the bottom of every single picture and is ruining it as a digital picture frame.  People have been begging Amazon for years too stop doing this and they keep ignoring it. I have turned off continuous scroll, Discovery,  and every other setting I could find and it is still there. This is infuriating.  I mean really, by now, most people know how to use their alexa devices, so why do they think this is necessary?!?! It makes no sense that they should force this on everyone .  I have an echo spot and even a show 5 that I was able to get it to at least only show it once, but on the 8 they apparently decided it should be a part of the wallpaper itself. You also can't adjust the clock size or position like you can on the show 5. There is nothing worse than looking at pictures of your beautiful children with the stupid things to try at the bottom.",1,1,2019-12-2,1,5,0

When I saw the reviews for this device and saw there was an argument about if you could turn off the “things to try” and the “most helpful” review by far was saying that “things to try” COULD be turned off I figured that it could be turned off and i should still buy the product. (I bought 3)  After spending 1 hour I can confirm the “most helpful” review here is completely false and “things to try” cannot be turned off in any way.  The most helpful review here should be removed as it is incorrect.  Also “things to try” is much more annoying than I thought it would be.,1,1,2019-12-8,1,4,0
"Replaced my Echo Spot with the Show 8.  Very nice screen resolution and easy to use.  I like the streaming video available as well as the standard Echo features.  My one disappointment is the lack of ability to change the clock look.  I should be able to have a large clock display over most of the screen or other cool features, but right now only a small display in one corner.  Hopefully this will be resolved in a future update.",4,1,2019-11-26,1,4,0
"How Amazon thinks people will tolerate a device which force them to watch things on the screen all of the time that we do not want to ever see is amazing.Maybe they'll get the message that thousands of people are complaining about the same thing,  I wish I'd seen the complaints and poor reviews before hand.  I want to set this so nothing shows on the screen except the time in big numbers.  None of the THINGS TO TRY constantly changing and annoying us.",1,1,2019-12-6,1,4,0

"Context: I'm very ""Alexified."" Two full-size Echos, a Dot, a 4K Firestick, and now a Show 8. Various household smart devices including lighting, smart plugs, and a thermostat. So, I'm technically knowledgeable and happy in the Alexa/Amazon universe. A friend has a Show 5, and I wanted a new device in my kitchen, to replace the Dot, which was connected to (i.e., plugged into) a better speaker. Along came the Show 8 (the friend told me he was going to replace his 5 with the 8). Reviews indicated that the sound was good (it is; at least as good as my previous wired speaker). I was concerned about the negative reviews about the clock and the ""Try . . "" notifications, but some reviews said you could change the options in Settings (and in case you want to know up front, those reviews are incorrect; you can't). So here goes with the rest of my review:Pro's:",3,1,2019-11-30,1,4,0
"I love the Echo Show 8. The only thing I hate the most is the SMALL DIGITAL CLOCK!! Why would you put such a small clock on a bigger screen! When the Echo Show 8 goes into ambient mode the clock is in the corner!! Lol. I hope you update this to a BIGGER CLOCK!! If not I'll send it back and be happy with the Echo show 5. Sound is great! Picks up my voice better than the show 5. I'm using an extra stand from my show 5 and I don't know if I'll need a stand right now. Please stop displaying ask Alexa this or try this on my screen. I don't want to see that stuff! Should be able to just display things I want to see!! It works great with my Wyze Cameras and all my WiFi lights. The sound is really really good!! Way better than the Echo Show 5. I can't stand the clock is so small! I had friends looking in the manual and online for a way to make that clock biggie! I hope I mentioned the ambient clock enough, so it gets stuck in your head's!! PLEASE UPDATE THE AMBIENT CLOCK! I wish I can change the color of the clock. I have until January 31 to return it. Get moving on some updates!",4,1,2019-11-29,1,3,1
"Will change from 1 star to five once they make it so that we can remove the ""try, alexa"" annoying suggestions at the bottom of the screen. How this is not an option baffles me. Really really bad programmers...",1,1,2019-12-2,1,4,0
"So I read the comments before I purchased it stating that the ""Try, Alexa ...."" messages can't be removed from the screen.  Honestly I thought that was wrong.  But nope you really can't remove these messages.  They are on the bottom of every screen.  It is unbelievably annoying.  You think you should get use to it but you don't.There are complaints all over the web about this yet Amazon has done nothing.  Amazon if you read these messages let me give you a tip.  These messages don't make me more likely to use services they make me less likely.  I don't read the messages, I try to ignore them.",1,1,2019-12-12,1,3,0
"Works nice, but is glitchy for the main reason I bought it. I purchased the Echo Show 8 so I could view live video on it in my office. Unfortunately it fails to work most of the time. It will connect sound but not the video feed.  I can view the video fine on my phone and iPad, but not on the Echo.

"My LCD clock in the family room is getting old and I was think about using this one as a nice replacement for it. I already have a couple of Echo Show 5"" in the kitchen and bedroom. What could go wrong with a bigger screen Echo Show ?! Well it turned out that I couldn't be more wrong that I'm now considering myself intelligently challenged compared to the super-smart Amazon people. Echo Show 5"" and 8"" are *totally* different !! With this big screen it does *NOT* allow you to choose the Clock Face. You only have a tiny clock showing on the 8"" screen. From the couch reading the time is like doing a vision exam at the eye doctor's office.So, I'm sorry, back you go. And good job, Amazon !",1,1,2019-12-17,1,9,0
"The product wouldn't connect to my wifi, so I live-chatted with Amazon to see what was up.  It took approximately 75 minutes for the agent to tell me to do everything I told him I had already done.  In the end, it was decided that the product was defective and I should exchange it for a new one.The new one came to the wrong address (home, where nobody is during the day, vs. work, which I'd requested), and was Refurbished, in a plain black box instead of the one the Echo Show should come in, with even the Refurbished sticker sliced open, and missing the power cord.",1,1,2019-12-20,1,8,0
"Pros: The sound is great on this device and was easy to set up and sync with my other smart devices.Cons: The main one, and I almost sent it back due to it, is that it is difficult to get your own recipes on this. The main reason I purchased this echo was to have an easy way to pull up my recipes while cooking. The description says you can use the All Recipes skill, however they made it so you can’t sync to your All Recipes account. This makes it a pretty useless skill. I did find that there is a Sous Chef Recipe skill that is fairly basic looking, but easy to use.",3,1,2019-11-29,1,9,0
"If you bought this hoping that Amazon finally listened to the tens of thousands of complaints about the annoying message of ""things to try"" randomly showing up - then do not buy this.I decided to buy this as a replacement for my Echo Spot as I went through several f those through the past couple of years because they all developed the video jittering and jumping issue - which was a chronic issue with the Spots.",1,1,2020-4-14,1,6,0
"Hands free video phone for mom and wonderful for our needs! We bought thisAlexa Show 8 to keep in touch with mom during the COVID-19 quarantine. She has no cell phone and lives in an assisted living facility that we could not enter, so we were concerned about setup. We had it shipped to us and set it up with my phone on our home internet. Amazon has special Alexa-trained tech staff to help with any setup difficulties. The learning curve was pretty steep, and online tutorials weren't always  helpful, so I had to call multiple times. Each time support was friendly, courteous, and really helpful. It took a week of playing around, but when we were done, I had the device set up on a new Amazon account with no credit card, so I could give the password to staff who would set up the device. We were able to block my contacts from showing up on the device (which is somewhat public and handled by staff), and family members all had drop-in permission granted on the device. Staff only had to set it up on their internet and re-enter the Amazon account. We had them set it in a place where private areas of her room (bathroom) are not visible to the device. Now we can drop in on mom and she can see and hear us well. She doesn't need to do a thing to answer. If we are concerned about privacy we call her phone first to make sure she would like a video visit. Mom was depressed and confused about not getting visits, and has not been able to use her phone well or hear it well. The Alexa speaker is loud and clear, and works really well. This has been a fabulous gift to us all!",5,1,2020-5-2,1,6,0

Instead, it only displays a screen shot of the last time it connected properly and says “Waiting for Arlo” for hours. I spoke with Amazon technical support for two hours and followed all their troubleshooting tips from resetting devices to upgrading software which included climbing up and down a ladder twice to resync my Arlo front door camera. The only compensation an Amazon supervisor could offer me for their false advertising, poor customer service, and inconvenience to me is a return and refund.

"So I got the Echo Show 5 early Nov 2019 as the Echo Show 8 wasn't going to be released until the end of the month and I needed a new Bedside alarm clock.  While I did like it, I felt it was too small for my needs.  The Echo 8 finally got released and so I sent this one back and ordered the Echo 8.  It was easy enough to do a Return and order this in its place.  So Amazon is great there.So I've included some pictures while I had both the 5 and 8 at the same time.  You can see the 8 on the left and the 5 on the right.  Front view and side view along with it in the dark.

The Show 8 is not like the Show 5. It WILL NOT display a large clock with the date AT ALL. What were you thinking Amazon? It's bad enough you're not responding to user complaints with the try whatever garbage in every screen. Now you took away the clock? EPIC FAIL!! I would NOT recommend the Show 8 to anyone.

"The Echo Show is barely usable, yet has great potential.I say this because I wanted a nice Clock/iHeartRadio/Calendar/Weather Forecast/Voice Control for home automation device for my desk.  The Echo Show fails to provide these services...seamlessly.  Each of my requirements can be individually met, but not together.  Let me explain: If you are listening to iHeartRadio, then you cannot see the clock/weather/etc...  The BASIC function of what time it is does not work if you are listening to a radio stream.  The iHeartRadio app takes total control of your display, NO ROTATION of other apps.  There goes the clock.  Further, the font for the clock is not configurable.  Epic Fail for those with less than perfect vision.  The ability to customize this product to my desires/needs is why I rate this product as being barely able to be sold as an automation product.  To add insult, Amazon runs hints across the bottom of the screen: Try ""Alexa, open ....""  This is nothing but annoying SPAM!  You cannot disable this ""feature"".  I own most of the Echo product line and threw out the Google products because even with all of Echo's short comings it's still better than Google.  If you think that the Harmony product line integration with Echo is good, you are wrong.  Again, barely crosses the line of usability.  Example, you cannot set up a voice command to execute a single IR button (ie. arrow up, arrow down, etc..).  I have installed high end automation equipment in my house (Crestron) and compare this product with decent home automation.  Echo is not ready for ""prime time"" yet, has great potential...eventually...hopefully.",1,1,2019-11-30,1,8,0
"I bought this device to use as a way to upgrade one of my seven Echo Dots to see my Ring camera and to use as an electronic picture frame.  I'm very disappointed with the quality of photos streamed from my Amazon Prime Photos account to this device.  They are washed out and have a slight green cast.  There are no controls that allow me to improve the quality of the photos as they appear on the Show's screen.  While the quality of whats displayed is very disappointing, even more annoying is the fact that there is a text line toward the bottom of the screen announcing things for you to try on your Alexa device.  I feel like I've purchased an on going commercial for Alexa.  There is not a setting to turn this text line off and when I called the Amazon Show help line they did not have an answer for either of these issues.  Until Amazon address both of these issues I cannot recommend buying a Show 8"" HD device to anyone.",1,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0

"Just received my Echo Show 8, set up was basically the same as an Echo Show 5, however, there is differences when it comes to the menu and options, I liked the addition of optional photos to chose from but the option to have the day/date on the screen is gone, who would do that, also there is no options for making the time fonts bigger/smaller.  Would be nice also if you could change the font colors. The speed at which the pictures rotate is much to fast, at least for me, maybe more options would be nice like an hour or 2-3-4 or even as long as a day, have a different picture every morning.  The size is nice but without being able to enlarge the fonts .. well .. would be nice for people that can't see real well. Overall I like it but needs some fine tuning as far as options especially for the price.  Another thing is I really don't need Alexa telling me to try and do things all day long I mean come on, how about an opt out button.Update;  12/12/2019",2,1,2019-11-28,1,6,1

Thinking the two devices would share a common software/user interface, I only glanced at a few of the reviews, and mentally wrote the negative ones off as likely operator error.

I shouldn’t have to argue with AI! I think they should have researched more instead of throwing a half completed AI bitch on the market.Also, Amazon is extremely CONTROLLING!

"Have an Echo Dot and a Yamaha sound system with built-n Alexa, but our new Echo Show is really slick and our hands-down favorite.  Sharp color display and good sound quality.

There is absolutely no way for you to link your account so you won’t have access to your personal or saved recipes. Instead they will give you a few options to choose from. That’s useless to me. I finally figured out a way to access my personal recipes by using the web browser instead of using a skull. This would have been a minor inconvenience that I could live with except for one major issue. The Echo Show won’t play music and allow you to use the web browser at the same time. I always listen to music while cooking so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. It blows my mind that Amazon would design such a limited device as this when the top use of their devices is streaming music. This device doesn’t meet our needs in the least. I guess I will go back to using a tablet to look at my recipes while streaming music over a Dot. What a shame. I really thought Amazon was better than this.

This means that if you bought the Echo Show 8 to be able to see the clock easier due to it being larger you will actually get a smaller clock display.",1,1,2019-12-20,1,1,0
"The ES8 is a nice unit but it would be nice if Amazon could make it possible to get rid of the Try Alexa ----on the bottom. One reviewer said to go to home and clock then home content and then turn off Discovery. That's not quite correct for the ES8, that is how you get rid of the Try Alexa on ES5 not the 8. There is no Home and Clock, the 8 has a wallpaper and clock and right below that is the home content where you find discovery, and you can turn it off until you turn blue in the face, it will not cancel the Try Alexa. Maybe I have a different ES8 or Amazon posted the review for the wrong Echo Show. The second difference from the es5 is the clock. You have one setting. Overall the ES8 is a nice unit, just wish Amazons software department would have kept some of the features the 5 has.

I hope Amazon will listen to their customers and offer an option to disable this device behavior.

"First impression - not impressed. There is much, much room for improvements with this device. I'll say that the ""suggestions"" at the bottom of the screen are a non-issue for us, I can't imagine why this bothers some people as much as it does. Frankly, I never notice them on my Fire TVs or this Echo. Pros are good sound, and everything as far as smart home device control goes. Having had an Echo in the house since the beta edition, we have added many bulbs and a thermostat that the Echo Show works well with. The cons are too many and too important. a) It has Hulu, but no Netflix. It is the only device I know of that can't get Netflix. The only video options it has are NBC (wow), Hulu, Food Channel if you pay for the service, Tubi and Prime video.  One out of 5 is not bad, would love to have more options there. b) The inability to add any apps. If I could put SlingTV on this, I wouldn't care about the Netflix. Adding Plex would give me access to my own server of content. c) YouTube looks awful. You can ask Alexa to do a YouTube search and you get all these tiny thumbnails in one column that runs down the left side while the majority of the screen is left unused, just white wasted space. I've tried both browsers and they both look like this. The YouTube app would help here. d) Fingerprints on the screen are VERY noticeable and take away from the picture quality. I believe that after any initial setting up I won't be touching it too much anyway. e) When I'm using the screen for viewing something and I tell Alexa to turn off a light, it goes to a very useless/annoying screen showing a light bulb with a slider next to it... and it stays there 15 seconds or so. Meanwhile, I'm missing my other thing I was watching. Why would it do this? I've obviously just displayed the fact that I can control the light with my voice, why would I now need a second option for the light adjustments for my finger?? This alone is a deal breaker!! f) So far, I have not been able access all of the content that I get on my Kindle. I push many recipes and other Docs to my Kindle and can see that content on any device that runs the Kindle app....until now. I can see my books, but not my Docs/Collections. Did not see that coming. Now for recipes I'm seeing that I need to sign up with AllRecipes.com and send recipes there to easily access them with the Echo Show.It seems to me, to get the most out of this, I need to conform to Amazon's way and not mine. Get an allrecpies account, sign up with Hulu. Or if I buy a Ring doorbell I can see a camera view. On my FireTV and Kindle tablets I am able to access all of my security cameras with the installation of a single app. I just received the Show yesterday and I will look to see if I can make this thing more useful for my needs, I honestly haven't spent that much time with it. Maybe I can find some answers to my concerns. In the past, while I'm in the kitchen, I have just stood my Kindle Fire 8 tablet on the counter, I'll probably go back to doing that. The tablet has more functionality, all the apps, all my Kindle content and and it's portable. I'm going to update this review in a couple of days. By then, I will have decided if the Show has to go.",2,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
"A long awaited flop. I bought this to perform one task, that of ""show and tell"" .  As advertised this unit is supposed to be able to identify pantry items by holding them up and asking Alexa ""what am I holding ?"" Well it doesn't. I spent over 45 minutes talking to India and their techs who were very polite yet could not figure it out. My wife is legally blind and was so looking forward to this, as I had been hyping this feature for weeks. The second tech did however offer me a 15% discount on the Echo Show 10 which he assured me the feature would work. I can't send this back fast enough. Besides the fact that this seems like a tabletop billboard for Amazon with a banner of suggestions non stopping across the bottom of the screen.

"I decided to switch away from Google since they obviously have their own perception of reality with security and ownership of your data (not to mention their tilted view of the truth). So all my google devices went in the closet and I got all new Alexa stuff, ranging from multiple displays, Echo devices, door locks, therms, etc.Sadly, this is not at the Google level of automation. Amazon's choice in the way they add in skills is about as bad as I've seen. It's like modded Minecraft back in the alpha days. I can understand the desire to throw off development of their ecosystem to other developers - it's a lot of work to interface with stuff. Unfortunately, you get what you'd expect from every place out there trying to figure out how to interface up - a big mess. I'll use my Roomba vacuum as an example.  It's almost useless to think there's any integration happening. Around 70% of the time, it does not work. For example, Roomba like to come on and work right when I'm eating lunch, so you'd think I could just shout out to Alexa to pause the vacuum job. Well, that's wishful thinking. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't understand what Roomba is. Same goes for my Samsung TV and some other devices.",2,1,2020-5-1,1,9,0

First, unless we are fairly close to the Show 8 we cannot see the clock in the upper left hand corner. Unlike the the Show 5, there are no templates with a simple monochrome background and a large font clock in the center.  Second, there is no displayed date.

"I second, third, fourth etc. all the same questions/suggestions in the Amazon Echo Show 8 Clock Faces forum: PLEASE ADD CHANGEABLE CLOCK FACES AND CLOCK SIZES TO THE SHOW 8 LIKE SHOW 5 HAS!  I just bought 2 Show 8's thinking I was getting a bigger version of my Show 5 with maybe more enhancements AND I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I bought 1 Show 8 for work to replace my tiny Lenovo Google clock that has a bland clock face but it has large and readable clock numbers and gives you weather with condition backgrounds (rainy etc.) and NO try this, try that and the other thing.  The Echo Show 8 has a huge screen but tiny, unchangeable clock numbers, a small current temperature number and icon, none of which can be changed, and lame illustrated clock backgrounds unlike the nice Show 5 ones (you can put in your own photos via Amazon photos and/or use their nature or other photos).  If you play music or something else, the clock face totally disappears and you can't tell what time it is; e.g. if you are listening to music for a few hours, there's no clock face or overlay while the music is playing.  Also, if you are in any other function other than clock only, there is a non-stop Try This, Try That bar running along the bottom of the screen with no way to turn it off!  On the Show 5, at least you can set it so that it displays only once when you change the screen function and then it goes away.  The Show 8 does have a better screen type than the Show 5, it looks like the Show 5 has a TFT screen whereas the Show 8 appears to have an IPS or similar screen so you have better visibility off-axis.

"I was quite surprised to find this device to be mediocre.  Alexa is not as good at voice recognition as Siri, and Alexa seems to have less sophistication in recognizing slightly different ways of giving her commands.  For example, after a timer I’ve set has gone off, I have to say “Alexa, stop.”  If I say “Alexa, stop the timer” or “Alexa, stop timing,” she won’t understand what I’m trying to say.I was hoping to use the Echo Show 8 as a digital slide show of our grandchildren.  That’s easy to set up as a screensaver, but for any photo in portrait mode, rather than using monochromatic vertical left and right bars (say, black or grey), the vertical bars are a smorgasbord of colors taken from the image being displayed (it looks something like a washed out, faint version of the photo with a semi-transparent grey on top).",3,1,2020-1-12,1,4,0
"Ok I’m not a highly knowledgeable person when it comes to tech, but I’m not a novice either. I actually bought the Show 8 and the Google Nest Hub at the same time because they were priced the same. I figured I would keep the better of the two. Nest arrived first so I set it up first. Setup was incredibly easy (I already have a nest mini), eventually easier than the Show. I also have a gmail account so that speeds up things on the Nest as well. I wasn’t keeping my photos on Google but it was pretty quick to add favorites in one folder and the Nest is now a digital photo frame. I have it on my nightstand because when you turn out the lights it really does go dark as well with a hint of the time showing - in full screen size. I am VERY sensitive to light at night and this doesn’t bother me at all. I also really like the “good morning” routine that you set up in the Nest better than the Show. It’s simple enough to ask and get info right before walking out the door.Once the Show arrived I did the setup thinking it would be easy as I have 3 dots and an Echo already. So yeah, setup went ok until you explore thinking ALL the reviews are wrong and you CAN turn off the “try this” feature. The answer is NO, you can’t. I have every part that should turn it off switched to off (even on the app). Constant “try this” on the screen. It’s ALWAYS there. And there is a list of what seems like a 100 “cards” so it never runs out. The software must’ve changed because all of the offered suggestions to turn it off aren’t accurate for what is currently possible.

Unfortunately, im not always heard clearly.  I have taken full advantage of prime video and Hulu which plays clearly and the sound is entirely louder and crisper than I ever expected.

On the echo five, there is a set of very attractive clock faces that can be chosen, but on this unit you can only choose a category such as art, travel etc. The echo will then choose random clock faces from that category to display. I would very much prefer having the ability to choose a clock face and stay on that one as opposed to having the unit choose various faces for me.

I signed up for Food Network TV so that I could use one of the Show 8's in the kitchen, but it has no ability to do any of the live shows. It's sorta like Samsung and Apple TV's Food Network app, just some old recorded shows. Overall, it's just a larger screen that has Alexa and tells time, weather, etc. Touchscreen doesn't seem to work as well as the Show 5. I wonder if the largest Show has a glass screen. That might be why it's so expensive. The 1MP camera doesn't bother me as I don't use the video chat feature as I usually just use FaceTime. Sound is a bit better than the 5.UPDATE: I used the Amazon Trade-in Program where they give you X amount of money for an older Alexa device so long as your device isn't cracked. I traded in a Dot. The trade in amount was a mere $5. When they got it, they appraised it at $2 so I only got $2. I wasn't expecting that. My friend traded in his Echo. They told him it'd be $25. They sent it back to him without explanation and they kept his power supply. He spent 40 minutes on the phone being transferred to 3 people to finally get a resolution. Long story short. They do not explain why they refuse items or lower your value. Do NOT use the Trade-in program.",3,1,2019-12-8,1,5,0
"I have 2 main issues with the Echo Show 8:1. There doesn't appear to be any way to turn off the annoying feature that displays the constantly changing phrases that begin with ""Try, Alexa ...""",2,1,2019-12-1,1,8,0
I have the show 5 which is a nice bedroom sized device or in my case under the TV in the den. I like it because the clock fills the display and its easy to see across the living room. I actually purchased the Show 8 for my bedroom. I was concerned the time only showing in the bottom corner would be a problem but its really not. Would I prefer the whole screen to show the time? Yes but the numerals are big enough to see over several feet without any issues even when I'm not wearing glasses. I bought the show 8 because I wanted better and fuller stereo sound and for the size this delivers nicely. I like that I can tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell camera when I'm in the bedroom! I'd say this is the most perfect Echo device I have overall. I also have the Sonos speakers with integrated alexa and they do not accept commands as well as the Amazon made echo devices. The display is very clear when it rolls through my photos. I like that it dims at night and just shows the time with a blank background so that it doesn't light up the bedroom.,5,1,2020-1-22,1,5,0

"Have to say I had higher expectations.  Will break down my review in a few parts noting that I have technically not received the product yet, however I did see the stand and played around with it at the Amazon store.  Here are a few things that bug me:1) Amazon's website says the item is out of stock and will take 2 weeks to deliver.  That's fine, until I drive 5 minutes to an Amazon store where they have piles of boxes of the Echo show 8 in both colors.  Why would Amazon's online store be out of stock when they have so many in stock so close by??",3,1,2019-12-1,1,5,0
"While I was looking forward to a bigger screen to be seen further away, I was disappointed in a few things in comparison to the Echo Show 5.  It does have a bigger screen, however, the clock face is not as customizable as the 5.  Also, most of the time while on the home screen only shows the time, appearing to have no option to show the weather and date all the time such as the Show 5 does.  The sound is the same as the 5, the screen is bigger, but otherwise disappointed in the features of the Echo Show 8.",3,1,2019-11-27,1,6,0
"Clarification on some other reviewers’ comments: don’t confuse this with echo show 5–some reviewers suggest going to Home and Clock under settings to get a full clock showing and to remove Alexa skills rotation.  There is no such setting in echo 8.  Instead, it is wallpaper and clock.  And you don’t get to set a full clock face.  Just say Alexa show clock and she tells you, outright, “it is not supported on this device!”I am not sure if I would recommend echo show 8, given certain limitations I have seen, especially at the full price.  First, something that many other buyers have said:  lack of clock faces.  At night, I would hope for it to have a full clock face like echo show 5 does, but no.  All you see is a dim small digital clock.  Next, the annoying “echo does this echo does that” notices that rotate on the screen.  I have read suggestions in many forums on how to stop this, but no luck so far.  YouTube videos seem to be a natural for the 8 inch screen.  But there is no native YouTube app.  Rather, you are directed to a somewhat primitive-looking YouTube site on a browser, and from there you proceed to watch videos—which of course look quite good.  That said, the sound is pretty good, the screen in pretty good, and it does all Alexa skills pretty good.  Personally, I would get an echo show 5 and a traditional echo speaker in place of echo show 8.  A bit more expensive, combined, but best of both worlds.  By the way, I like the echo ecosystem a lot—I have one type or another in every room, and now in my car too.",3,1,2020-1-19,1,4,0

"Constantly hangs on simple tasks. The 25 dollar 2nd gen dot works tons better. Sure, there’s a big screen. The try it stuff on the bottom isn’t that bothersome to me. It’s the fact that I tell it to turn on a light, and the blue band stays across the bottom of the screen like it’s waiting for me to say something else, then the band disappears, I get no response, like “ok”, and I get no lights on.I been using the dots for awhile, everything is set up, and works on the other dots. It’s like this device suffers from a case of the “stupids”. I think the screen is a niche thing that nobody really needs in an age of cell phones, and it makes the device worse by having it. I’m thinking the Show uses different firmware than the dot, and the show firmware is poorly done, which is actually a conservative review.",2,1,2019-12-1,1,4,0
"Great device. I am glad I waited for the 8 inch. Definitely worth it. If you can still get it for under $100, get one before prices go back up.  I like being able to see my Ring cam, listen to radio stations, Alexa even plays games.. so far my favorite is guessing the song..I tried 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. You can play with another so as well.  It’s like having a tablet without running on battery and a great loud speaker already attached. Only thing she can’t do is make me a ham sandwich lol.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,6,0
"We were looking for an information hub in the kitchen with news traffic and weather updates that would play music for the kids.Traffic maps cost extra, weather maps cost extra, wallpaper photos won't rotate in the background. The news is mostly audio only from NPR which is fine but we have a video screen and would like to use it. Just very disappointed overall.",1,1,2020-1-23,1,5,0
I think the marketing of this item to the rest of the world should be a bit more honest. It's not supported outside North America and some European countries.You shouldn't charge $100 and none of the features are available outside America,1,1,2020-1-29,1,4,0
"This HD 8 is our 2nd recently-purchased Echo Show, the other being a previously purchased Echo Show HD 5.  It replaced a standard Echo.  The sound and video are very good.  Setup was reasonably easy and Alexa integration is very good. However...It’s annoyingly quirky, starting with the settings, which are, oddly and confusingly, different than those on the HD 5.  The most annoying setting difference is the home screen “Wallpaper & Clock” selection; while you can choose different background “categories”, you can’t prevent them from rotating the multiple images (some being strange) within the chosen category, which becomes distracting eventually.  I had to change my background to “Minimal”, which is just a blank screen with a small time, weather icon, and outdoor temperature display in the upper left corner, also different than the HD 5.",1,1,2020-2-15,1,3,0
"For those of you who are thinking of getting one, you must realize this is NOT like your Kindle Fire.  No Apps.  It is essentially an Echo Dot with a screen.  You do have to do some learning where to find things like your music and movie/tv playlists, internet, etc.  But honestly, when it comes down to it, all you have to do is tell Alexa what you want and she will assist.  It literally takes any type of typing needed away.  I wanted the internet and all I have to say is ""Alexa, open Silk"" and there is the internet that you all know with the search bar/address bar up top and when you want to look for something, hit the search bar and up comes a keyboard.  You just need to know what to say.  People have complained about the pop-ups that say ""Try this"" and ""Try that"", but honestly, I actually kind of like it.  Alexa has suggested many things that I would not have thought of and they are quite interesting.  Lastly, people have complained about how this MUST be PLUGGED in to power it.  That was a very big con for me, but I got around it by buying a battery pack (Skull Candy Fat Stash, about the size of a deck of cards $40) and BiXPower USB Port Power Cable with 4 Extra Popular Interchangeable Connector Tips.  The largest tip works with the Echo Show 8 and the cord is a couple of inches long, making portability very easy!!!  We are definitely using it more than we thought and it works great.  Awesome sound and picture quality.  Two thumbs up!",4,1,2020-1-24,1,3,0
"Here's why I'm giving it 1 star. The Echo 5 has a clock face you can change, make analog or digital, have different colors, etc; it's the cool feature you see on all the commercials. The Echo 8 (this device) does not have that functionality, it only has a small 1/2"" clock that appears on the top left of the screen. This device also has this ""Try this on Alexa"" recommendation on the bottom of the screen that changes every 10 seconds or so; you cannot get rid of this, there is NOT currently a setting to remove it. Also the skill to control Amazon music is seriously lacking, all you can do is pause music or forward/reverse to the next song. I was hoping for more functionality like you get from the tablet or phone app.I was going to return this but decided to put it next to my kid's computer, they'll enjoy the picture slideshow functionality.",1,1,2019-12-23,1,4,0

"I like the larger screen, but the sound sucks.  Even worse is the microphones, It will hardly respond to its name and only recognizes about one out of four or five requests.  I ask it to turn on a light and it plays music or runs a video, absolutely stupid responses to requests.  It is so bad that my wife and I say words just to see what it will do next?  Total junk, and I love all of my older devices.  They have reduced the number of microphones and I think it just can't hear and understand.  I can't recommend this newer equipment to anyone.

They are useless as the video takes forever to focus and the audio is filled with the NOISE of FEEEEEEDBACK.  My internet speed for these devices is at 250 Mbps  so that's not the problem.  I have turned the volume down and still get NOISE, so that's not the problem.  They work fine for music but not as an intercom.

"Ok, so like, a decade ago I was an early adopter of the Sony Dash, it was a small tabletop alarm clock that could show you facebook posts, play music, play Netflix, and a bunch of other stuff. The thing about the Sony Dash was that it completely sucked! The interface was clunky, the home screen was not customizable and the video playback was always choppy. After a few years Sony stopped supporting the device all together and it became a paper weight. This was probably somewhere in 2008-2009. Well, ten years later I just picked up the Amazon Echo 8 and I blown away at how awesome it is! The sound quality is GREAT! The screen is beautiful! The ease of use is amazing. Within minutes I had it connected to Prime Video, XM satellite radio, and all the other stuff. I highly recommend this as an addition to any room. I am blown away!",5,1,2019-12-6,1,4,0

"My family purchased the Echo Show 8 for my 95 year old grandmother to make video calls and stay connected to us during COVID-19. According to the ad page on Amazon, it's ""Simple to set up and use! 1. Plug in 2. Connect to the internet using Echo Show 3. Just ask Alexa for music, weather, news and more"". What the description does NOT tell you is that a smart phone with Wifi/the Alexa app is required for setup as well. I have been relatively tech savvy with virtually every other device I've ever purchased - this is, by far, the least intuitive/user friendly. I set up an Amazon account using my grandmother's name and email, got her to verify the one-time password and confirm the account, then logged into Alexa using that account. I added myself, parents, and siblings to the contacts in the Alexa app, which for some stupid reason won't sync with the Echo Show despite being connected to her Alexa account. There appears to be no option to add contacts directly through the Echo Show itself without connecting/verifying a mobile phone number (which, again, why TF would you need an Echo Show if you already have a smart phone that supports video chatting).If you're buying this for a family member and they already own a smart phone, you might as well just go with the video chatting via Facebook messenger - at least that is free and easy to use. This was an absolute waste of time and money. Wish I could give zero stars!",1,1,2020-6-24,1,4,0

"Having already owned an Echo Dot for several years and being familiar with its eccentricities, the Echo Show 8 was purchased to be a monitor for my Ring Camera as well as all the features of Alexa.  If you're planning on acquiring one be sure to get the not included magnetic stand.  It's around $20 or so recommended for the Show device.  I don't know why Show did not include one with the device.  Otherwise the device sits on the counter with a slight backwards tilt, no adjustment.  The stand allows much greater movement and viewing angles.The sound from the speakers is excellent and I would have given it a 5 star rating instead of only 4.  Due to the design of the device the speakers are on the back, firing backwards.  Of course you can hear it from the front but not as good as if you stand behind it.  Actually the Dot had a better sound dispersal than the Show.  But I didn't buy it for audio entertainment.  As I'm moving about the house doing chores or such I simply tell Alexa to play Pandora radio.  Wonderful sound to be sure but...depends on how picky you are about such.  Otherwise it integrated immediately (pleasantly surprised!) so the Dot moved to my bedroom.  Though Dot cannot show me what the Ring camera sees it will alert me aloud that movement has been detected; my Fitbit does not.  Very good for waking me at night as something outside is moving about.  So I pick up my cell phone, open the Ring app and see what's up outside.  The Show will do just that:  Show you what your Ring (probably other camera brands as well, not sure) camera sees.  Just say ""Alexa show me the front door"" (or whatever location you designate) and it does.  I can also communicate through the Show device with the Ring camera.  Love it!  As for the rotating Alexa messages as many are complaining about, yes they are there.  Personally I'm not bothered in the least but I understand their gripe and agree there should be more flexibility in display setting.  There may be I just haven't been that concerned.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,2,0

No success. It's basically useless. My Wi-Fi shows it is connect with a ""good"" signal. The echo show actually shows that it IS connected with ""good"" signal... But still doesn't work. AT ALL. 1 to 2 days it worked... Then with no issue, just stopped...?? Even amazon can't help me. I mean... It sat on my counter for like 24 hours... It was barely used.

"I think just the Echo Dot 3rd generation is amazing! Then my mom bought me this wonderful Echo Show 8"". It does so much. You can see song lyrics. You can look up recipes. You get a video of the recipe. You can just scroll the screen for the ingredients or Alexa will read them to you. You can save the recipes in your favorites. The Echo Show 8"" is really amazing with the sturdy magnetic stand they sell for it. Echo Show 8"" even scrolls stuff across the screen giving you ideas you can try and not just for the Echo Show 8"" either. Now because of this item, I know so many more things I can do with my Echo Dot 3rd generation! The Show new everything about me. Integrated easily with my Dots. I learned you can ask Alexa who am I? Then if she doesn't know, she'll tell them who's Echo it is and ask you your name. Then when you tell her ,she'll ask if you want her to set up a voice profile you say yes. Then she will start calling you by your name. You can do that both on the Echo Show 8"" and the Echo Dot.

"If your main reason for buying the Echo 8 is a bigger screen, go for it.  It does that about as well as you would expect.  Everything else, except perhaps sound quality, puts it behind the Echo 5 in terms of quality and extras.The screen, while larger, seems a bit washed out to me, compared to the 5. You have far fewer customization options in terms of clock faces and backgrounds.  You would expect better sound quality given the larger cabinet and (presumably) larger speaker.

"I replaced the original ""Alexa"" we had in our living room with this echo show. At first I felt guilty removing Alexa, especially since she was one of the original beta tester echoes. But Alexa had been knocked off of the end table one too many times by the cats, leaving her top a bit crooked and wonky. Although she did still sound great, sometimes she had a bit of trouble hearing and we found ourselves yelling and repeating ourselves one too many times, it was time to send her to the old hobby closet.This echo show 8 is very nice, it was super easy to set up and the picture quality and sound are excellent.

"I am astonished that you can't set the clock size or position on this device!! I bought this for my bedroom, and for various reasons I have to put it on the dresser opposite my bed. I need a LARGE clock face - I bought the 8"" Echo instead of the 5"" because I thought the larger screen would let me have a LARGE clock face. Turns out the 5 lets you adjust these things while the 8 doesn't, so the 5 can actually get a larger clock than the 8! Absurd.To be clear, I love the Echo line and I've had various products from it. The screen on this one is beautiful, the sound is fine, the voice recognition works. Setup was a bit wonky - seemed it didn't recognize my wifi or Amazon passwords if I had ""Show"" on to see what I'd typed. Annoying, but whatever, you do it once.

"Love the product.  Bought one for myself and it works so well that we bought another for my wife's 91 year old mother.  Unfortunately, it is 100% impossible to configure this thing for communications (i.e. making video calls) because 91 year old mom doesn't have a smartphone (how many over-90s do you know that DO have smartphones)?  When we ran into this problem, I configured Echo Show using my wife's smartphone.  Everything seemed to work OK until we discovered that all of Mom's calls appear to be coming from my wife (because we set it up using my wife's smartphone number).  Not only that, but our other relatives can't call Mom on her Echo Show because Amazon doesn't recognize that she has an Echo Show (again because it's not associated with her smartphone BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE)!  I called Amazon Customer Support.  She explained to me that Amazon must verify the phone number by sending a text message with a one-time-code.  I told her I understood this, and asked if it would be possible to instead call my mother-in-law on her non-smartphone and read her a one-time code that she could then relay to me (just like she would do if they COULD text her a code).  Armed with this magic code, I could then assign her non-smart phone number to her Echo Show and the problem would be solved - VOILA!  I realize that we would still have to use our smartphones to make any future configuration changes to Mom's device, but that's OK because she wouldn't do it even if she did have a smartphone.  Unfortunately, Amazon Customer Support says no-can-do the simple phone call solution - no explanation why.  Their suggestion was to buy mom a smartphone solely for this purpose.  So now you know: Product = 5 stars.  Customer Service = 0 star.  Overall rating 1 star,  I'll bet Jeff Bezos has no idea that this is what they are telling customers.",1,1,2020-6-22,1,2,0

I like the idea of a video hub offering the option for a backlit photo frame that shuffles photos of my choice, but the never ending dialog at the bottom of the show 8 screen ruins that for me.

I suppose I could shout at Alexa from across  the room to ask for the time and date for but it is not worth the breathe when you could otherwise just glance at it.

The Alexa voice activation was inconsistent and required the end user to set up and document what verbal constructs actually work to achieve the goal. The program should act to recognize when the user is trying to  achieve some outcome and when it is finally reached identify the verbal sequence and relate it to the many attempts used before success and recognize these when they occur again. Now  a long process of learning what phrases in what gramatical order and  using which descriptors is required in all but the simplest of requests. Documentation is limited and aside from purchasing books written by authors who have puzzeled out the supposed manual of operation there is sparse and incomplete online content provided. All in all very frustrating and very limiting in usages of this product and ecosystem provided by online interfaces....,3,1,2019-12-21,1,2,0

"I picked up a Show 8 recently. Liked it enough that I decided to get two for a paired stereo setup, a function which Amazon claims you can do with this device.  Unfortunately, I found it just doesn't work. If it has for others, would love to hear about it. Spent hours on my own troubleshooting. Then tonight spent an hour on the phone with Amazon tech support. That's a lot of time wasted only to find that there just doesn't seem to be any way to get two Show 8's working as a stereo pair. Since I have no idea if its a bug, or one or both units malfunctioning, I'll now have to return all of it, including 2 Dots that came with the Show 8's on a holiday sale/promotion. Very disappointing. Hope they work out the bugs and get it working as is promised. Seems like a device with a lot of potential, but for me it was just wasted time.EDIT:  After hours and hours of wasted troubleshooting an Amazon staff member got back to me on their device forum advising Amazon's info on their Compatible Echo Devices page was WRONG!  Wasted a ton of time, money, and now even more time for returns because of Amazon's misinformation about the stereo pairing for these!  Ask me how annoyed I am at this moment?? Nice of Amazon to apologize on their forum for my ""inconvenience"". Lot of good that does me!!!  P.S. While they've now corrected their compatibility for stereo pairing page they've left questions answered here that still contain the wrong information. I hope others don't go thru a problem because of that. Merry XMAS to you to Amazon :(",1,1,2020-1-6,1,2,0

"Received as a gift for Christmas 2019. Disappointed in the day to day usability and practicality of this device. It has so much potential, but it just isn't integrated enough to be useful.Pros:",1,1,2020-4-21,1,3,0
"The screen quality is excellent, the sound quality is very good, and the features are many.  In fact, that is a problem starting out.  There is no manual and online help is limited.  I suppose I could spring another $10 for a book, but why?  I'm already not happy that there is no pre-booking guarantee.  I pre-ordered for $99, and the day it arrived the price was $79, but I cannot get the lower price.There are many features but getting the most out of them is not always easy.  For example, the alarm has a repeat function for daily, weekly, weekends, or week days.  I work a rotating schedule so the days I need an alarm rotate every two weeks.  After a couple of weeks, I discovered if I touch the date once I set an alarm, I can get a calendar.  This way I can program just the days I want the alarm.  Too bad there isn't a manual to look this up.",3,1,2019-12-19,1,2,0
"I've bought 4 Echo Show 8s for personal use (plus one replacement) and 2 as gifts. We previously had Echo Dots and had no issues with them but thought it would be nice to have the displays that the Echo Shows offer. However the Shows have been so frustrating we're about to throw them all in the garbage.About half the time when we use drop-in either the calling device or called device does not have audio. Also there are other audio issues that seem to randomly come and go. It's like Alexa suddenly goes mute. She'll display something on the screen (like the alarm when a timer expires) but there is no accompanying audio. We've ""reset"" them hundreds of times, upgraded the software to latest version and talked to support multiple times.",1,1,2020-3-15,1,2,0
"The most useless gift my children have ever bought me. They know I’m not tech savvy and with Parkinson’s Disease, a touch screen is useless. It picks up ANYTHING with Bluetooth, my laptop, my phone, you name it, the neighbors ALL know what and who I’m talking to! I’m on a 30 trial but will cancel ALL AMAZON accounts. You get this Gizmo, but each feature cost $ every month. I can’t imagine putting this thing in a bedroom! If it’s a clock, why not let it be large enough to read from a distance? If I ask Alexa to play a song, it can’t understand American English, plays the wrong song, then you can’t get the thing to stop — unless I unplug it. It will go back in the box to collect dust. Just as bad as a Nixplay picture frame that circulated the same five photos! Who needs a plug in picture frame? Why do I need Alexa to tell me what music I should play while cooking? What’s next? Music to take a shower with? Please, no more Star Trek gizmos to confuse and sell subscriptions to things I already can do. I have a camera. I have a phone. I have a stereo. I have a photo album. I can use them all at once, not so with this Echo 8 piece of China’s best export!",1,1,2020-5-28,1,2,0
"EVERYTHING IS CONTROLLED BY YOUR MOBIL ALEXA APP.  IT NEEDS A MAJOR UPGRADE, YET REMAINS THE SAME.  THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I ASSUMED THE LATEST GENERATION OF ECHO SHOW WOULD PROVIDE WAS AT LEAST THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AS MY MUCH OLDER ECHO  2ND GEN ECHO TOWER.  IT IS TWO YEAR OLD NOW BUT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE TEN TIMES BETTER THAN ANY ECHO SHOW, WHICH EXPLAINS EVEN THEIR PRIMARY ECHO' SHOW'S LOW RATINGS.WHAT IS MOST ANNOYING IS MY COMMANDS TO TURN ON A PARTICULAR DEVICE WILL APPEAR TO BE ACCEPTED AND COMPLETED AS THE ECHO SHOW SHUTS OFF, BUT THE LIGHT I TOLD HER TO TURN ON IS STILL UNLIT.  I HAVE TO AGAIN ASK HER TO DO THE SAME THING AND THEN IT COMES ON.  I HAVE MANY ECHO LIGHTS, PLUGS, AND OTHER DEVICES.  MY ATTEMPTS TO TRIGGER MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS TO OCCUR BY GIVING ALEXA A COMMAND RARELY WORKS.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICES THAT THE DEVICES WITH AMAZON PLUGS THAT WERE TURNED OFF HOURS EARLIER WILL SUDDENLY BE FOUND ON, WITHOUT EXPLANATION.  HAVING TO REPEAT THE SAME COMMAND TWO TIMES BEFORE IT TURNS ON OR OFF IS REALLY ANNOYING!  I WENT INTO THE ALEXA APP AND DELETED ANY PRIOR USE OF SKILLS AND CAN NO LONGER FIND ANY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DELETED.  YET I STILL WILL COME HOME TO FIND DEVICES (MOSTLY LIGHTS) THAT ARE SUDDENLY ON AS IF SHE IS ACTIVATING THEM AT A PREDETERMINED TIME.  YOU WILL FIND THAT ANY DEVICE THAT IS NOT MADE BY AMAZON, BUT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALEXA, MUST BE USED TO ACTIVATE THAT PLUG OR LIGHT.  I HAVE SMART-THINGS, KASA, ETC.  THEY MUST BE USED TO CONNECT THEIR DEVICE TO YOUR HOME NETWORK. ONCE THEY ARE WORKING PROPERLY, ALEXA CAN BE USED TO ADD THEM BUT WHAT IS NEEDED IS ONE CENTRAL ICON THAT CONTROLS EVERYTHING.  I'VE HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS TRYING TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND WITH ALEXA WITHOUT HAVING TO REPEAT IT 2-3 TIMES BEFORE A LIGHT GOES OFF THAT I'M READY TO SEND THE THING BACK.  THE LEARNING CURVE FOR ALEXA IS MUCH GREATER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.  THE TERMS THAT AMAZON USES TO DESCRIVE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ARE JUST NOT COMMON AND I WOULD NEVER REMEMBER TO SAY THEM IN ORDER FOR ALEXA TO TURN LIGHTS ON AND BEGIN PROVIDING THE DAILY WEATHER, NEWS ETC.  RATHER AN REQUESTING SHE PROVIDE YOUR MORNING NEWS AS SELECTED WHEN IT WAS SET UP, I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ITS NOT THE NEWS, ITS MY ""FLASH BRIEFING"".  WHEN I FIRST WAKE UP, I CAN'T REMEMBER TO USE A PHRASE THAT I'VE NEVER USED IN MY LIFE AND JUST ISN'T SOMETHING THAT SEEMS NECESSARY.  IF THEIR AI WAS A ONE FIRMWARE UPGRADE UP, ALEXA SHOULD ALLOW ME TO NAME MY ""SKILL"" WHICH IS ANOTHER WORD THAT JUST DOESN'T FIT THE PROCESS BEING PROGRAMMED.  FINALLY, ALEXA IS FAR FROM BEING READY FOR PRIME TIME BUT SIRI OR HEY GOOGLE ARE NO BETTER.  WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THE ECHO MODEL (SPECIFICALLY THE ECHO SHOW) HAS ITS VISUAL BENEFITS, HOWEVER, TO GAIN THOSE BENEFITS I FEEL I HAVE LOST THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF MY FORMER ECHO TOWER.  WHEREVER THEY PLACED THE MICROPHONE ON THE ECHO SHOW, UNLIKE THE ROUND ECHO TOWER THAT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE FROM ANY DIRECTION, THE ECHO SHOW CAN ONLY HEAR FROM THE FRONT OF THE UNIT.  IF THE TELEVISION IS ON, SHE WILL RARELY GET THAT I SAID CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH I AM SPEAKLING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY.  I CAN'T PROVIDE A REMINDER UNLESS I GO THROUGH FOUR STEPS. FORST TO NOTIFY ALEXA THAT I HAVE A NEW REMINDER, SHE WILL ASK WHAT IT IS BUT I CANNOT PROVIDE HER WHAT THE REMINDER IS  WHILE ALSO TELLING HER THE DATE AND TIME.  SHE WILL IGNORE IT EVERYTHING BUT WHAT THE REMINDER IS AND THEN ASK ME WHEN WHAT DATE AND TIME OF THE REMINDER.  I A POSITIVE I NEVER HAD TO DO THAT IN THE PAST.  SHE responds FROM HER ONLY RECORDING WHATEVER THE REMINDER IS BUT I MUST WAIT FOR HER TO ASK FOR THE DATE AND TIME.  I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING TO DO THAT WITH MY ALEXA ECHO TOWER???  IT TAKES SO MANY STEPS, I STOPPED USING IT.  APPARENTLY THE ALEXA APP ON MY PHONE IS THE PRIMARY BRAINS BUT EVERY ALEXA DEVICE IS NOT CREATED EQUALLY AND THE SOFTWARE THAT DRIVES IT IS UNIQUE TO THE DEVICE.  I HAVE EVEN BEGUN TO USE ANY OF THE FEATURES THE ECHO SHOW IS KNOWN FOR.  I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY THE ECHO SHOW WANTS TO DEFAULT TO CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH WHEN WI-FI HAS SUCH GREATER DISTANCE.  IF I ASK ALEXA A QUESTION SUCH AS, ""DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY PRESENTATION WILL BE BROADCAST ON TV""?  THAT REQUEST CAUSES HER TO GO INTO CONVULSIONS.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE QUESTION WAS AND BEGINS GIVING ME A HISTORY LESSON OF WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.  TRYING TO INTERRUPT HER TO SHUT HER UP IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.  SHE IS DEFINITELY FEMALE. LOL  NOW THAT SEVERAL CREDIBLE NEWS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT AMAZON'S RINGER PRODUCT WHICH I HAVEN'T INSTALLED YET, BUT I'M ASSUMING THE VIDEO IT RECORDS IS UPLOADED TO THE AMAZON CLOUD.  HOWEVER, THOSE RECORDING SHOULD BE ENCRYPTED AND PRIVATE. THEY SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED TO ANYONE WITHOUT THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF THE OWNER. ABC NEWS REPORTED THAT POLICE WERE SELLING SOMETHING AND GIVING AWAY ALEXA RINGERS BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE THEM CAMERAS ALL OVER THE CITY. i'm NOT OPPOSED TO THIS AS AN INVESTIGATOR, BUT I DO NOT WANT IT PROVIDED AUTOMATICALLY TO ANYONE AND IF AMAZON DOES SO, THEY WILL RUE THE DAY, PERHAPS BY BEING OFFLINE FOR A FEW WEEKS!",2,1,2019-12-16,1,2,0

"I was so excited to purchase this device during Black Friday 2019. I got an excellent deal on it and thought it a neat addition to my echo product collection. Today is 19 February 2020 a whole 3 months later and I couldn’t be more disappointed. I wanted to be able to pair my echo ear buds to it but after numerous failed attempts And me contacting amazon support about the issue it was never fixed even though I was told the customer support rep was personally looking into the issue and would provide me with follow up. I never got that issue resolved but no biggie I pressed on. Sure the sound quality is awesome,l although I can’t listen through earbuds, the functions are easy and screen is big enough to watch shows on when it works.....and that is the problem, it doesn’t seem to be working right anymore. A few nights ago I was watching a tv show on the device and literally 5 minutes in it cut off. I instantly thought it was my internet or something of that nature but checked internet and it was fine. It was time to get customer support on the line. They had me do a factory reset on the device and wala just like that it started working again. Awesome right? Wrong! I had the same issue the next day, day after that and day after that. Every night for almost a week I’ve had to do a factory reset on the device in order to watch more than 5 mins of tv show. It was time to get customer support back on the line. I spoke with the support who stated I’d need to send the device in to their support team to see if they could fix it and if they couldnt they’d replace. That’s all well and good but at 3 months old it shouldn’t be having any issues. Maybe they sent me a lemon? Who knows but what I do know is after only 3 months of use it should still be working just as good as the day I took it out of the box.",1,1,2020-2-19,1,2,0
02/24/2020 update: Still not working properly with Blink XT2 system and has developed problems with Wyze camera also. Searching the internet has shown even the Arlo cameras don't work reliably either.  The Amazon Alexa/Echo techs have stated that the problem in my case is with Blink since Blink is responsible for the Blink Skill app. The common denominator here is the Echo Show 8.

"And I'm really pleased with this. I had debated between this size and the larger one, but ultimately decided this would fit well in the space I had. I have this in my kitchen, I use it for viewing my recipes, playing music, etc. This is not my only alexa device in the house, I have a dot (in my daughters room and on her account), an echo show 5 (in my office), and the Fire cube.We had to turn off the voice activation on the cube (we have an open concept, so they were fighting) which my husband hates anyway, so he didn't mind that. My daughter had briefly moved her dot in her room and we discovered me using the show in the kitchen (near her room) was setting off her dot too, so she moved hers back and away from her door.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,2,0
"Well I started out having troubles with connecting my cameras, then I took a deep breath and reinstalled all the devices. Works like a charm, I have Ring doorbell and couple Wyze cameras and I can view them, yay! sound is good for the device, actually better then I expected(if I need better sound I was able to connect to speaker in the living room and bedroom, so I do have a choice of sound). There still issues with some skills for the show, but skills important to me work great.I am happy with my Alexa upgrade.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,4,0
"If you are still on the fence about buying the Show vs. the Echo, it's time to get off the fence. I have both, and I can honestly say the Show as much better voice recognition, response, and sound. It understands me and responds better than my Echo, and I can hear music from the next room clearly with the Show. Plus, my kids can connect with their cousin through video chat, which is great when we live far away!",5,1,2020-1-15,1,4,0
"Received the new Echo Show 8.  It was easy to set up and the app was easy to set up and understand. Everyday I learn something new that Echo can do. The screen quality is good,  but wish the small print at the bottom of the page telling you things was slightly larger. The voice does not always get what I ask correctly. So far have used it to check on the weather each day, play a couple of short games.  Listen to national news from CBS .  I guess my main dislike are the apps you have to pay for monthly to have an enhanced experience. I enjoy asking about What occurred this day in History each day.  Essentially my impressions so far are favorable.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,3,0
"I now have a 5 and an 8 and my review will be for both plus feedback for alexa in general. The screens are cool but it's a bit annoying that I can't get rid of the alexa tips on the screen. I know there are things I can ask alexa to do that I don't know about but a tutorial section I can go to would be enough. I wish I had the same cool backgrounds on the 8 that I have on the 5, although I do like that I can use my pics from facebook. The shows misunderstand me quite a bit more than the echoes. It can be frustrating. I'll ask for volume to set to 5 and be told that I can only set on a scale of 1 - 10, or ask for 6 and get 9. One example but not the only times I get misunderstood. Also, despite having it set to ""brief"" I still feel like she can be a bit too long winded. I'll ask for music on ""everywhere"" and the song is 10 seconds in on the other devices before she's done talking. Then there are things that only need to be said once or not at all. If I ask for music everywhere then I don't need to be told it's playing everywhere. The fact that it's playing everywhere is all I need.I wish alexa were better at learning. If I verbally ask for shuffle or repeat, for example on the white noise skill that I use, she'll boldly announce that she'll remember the setting for next time but that has never been the case on any of the devices. I always have to turn shuffle or repeat back on from playlist to playlist even. The speaker on the 5 is abysmal but the 8 is actually pretty good. As good as or better than the echoes. The 5 is basically a glorified alarm clock. Speaking of the white noise skills, they can be really hard on the speakers. It's odd that Amazon would allow a skill to be developed that can damage its devices.",3,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"I bought this item because I was looking to as an Alexa-Enabled Device to control my kitchen-Group.  Unfortunately I had to return this item because i learned that the screen display does NOT allow for easy control of SONOS system music selection, speaker selection, of volume control.  This device is not a Kindle Fire equivalent and relies primarily on ""Alex Skills"" to interface (no apps).  Regretfully, I had too many instances where i was frustrated not being able to quickly manage the whole-house music.  Hopefully this feature is further developed...otherwise the KINDLE FIRE 10 offers the best of all worlds except Amazon doers not allow the kindle 10 to be considered an ""alexa-enabled"" device for controlling a group/room.",1,1,2020-1-28,1,3,0
"My specific purpose for buying this item was for working with my XT2 camera system.  I was concerned about a number of things: (a) The 'things to try' crap supposedly showing constantly on the screen, and supposedly not being able to get rid of it, and complaints that the Show 8 would not work with the Blink XT2 camera system.  Well, you CAN't totally get rid of the 'things to try' blip, but you CAN greatly reduce it, to a degree of almost background noise, by reducing the rotation rate.  It then almost becomes a non-factor, which makes me EXTREMELY happy.  As for the connection to the Blink XT2 camera, you need to do a little bit of work.  You need to have established a Blink account, as instructed by the Blink XT2 camera instructions.  After you have created your Blink account, you then need to enable the 'Blink Smarthome' skill, for your echo Show 8.  When you have gone though the process of setting your camera system up, the skill on your echo Show 8 allows you to work with your XT2 camera, with no issues, via voice command, as you would expect.Now for another comment, about the camera itself, which has really nothing to do with the Echo Show 8, but just as an FYI.  I noted a lot of folks unhappy with the XT2, because it did not notify you immediately, when it detected omtion.  This was due to the fact that it notified AFTER it finished making a recording, NOT upon start of the recording, with detected motion.  Well, at the end of 2019, that item was addressed by Blink, as stated in the following message:",5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"First off, Kudos to amazon for doing right by me when my discontinued Echo spot started acting up.  They gave me the full purchase price as a credit toward the Show 8.  Ended up only costing me $5 with the $99 sale price.So now to the review.  It should be noted that I have a Show 5 as well, so I will make a couple of references when going over features and function.  To start, as HUGE plus is the ability to physically disable the camera.  This is something that the show 5 had but the Echo Spot didn't.  Its nice having the peace of mind not having to worry about anyone's privacy, no matter what room the device is in.",3,1,2020-1-10,1,1,0

"Update 1/22: About a month after I purchased it, it started playing random music, music I’d never listen to and was not music that was on the playlist I was listening to. The playlist I was listening to would just stop mid-song and techno music would start. Always the same two unknown techno bands. Sometimes it would start playing when I wasn’t even listening to music. I’d stop it and it would start back up again. I had no control over Alexa.  The issue increased from a couple of times a day to several times a day. Finally called in to Amazon tech support (in the Philippines) and after asking me a bunch of questions, they had me reset it. Minutes later it did it again. I love my Echo Show 8 but this is getting out of hand...........original review........",2,1,2019-12-3,1,2,0
"Prior to purchasing the Echo Show, I had the Echo Spot and was looking to trade it in for something newer. The Echo Shows were on sale and I was offered decent money to trade in the Echo Spot from Amazon, so I went for it. I wasn’t sure if I should get the Echo Show 5 or 8 to use as a replacement alarm clock and radio in the bedroom. I went with the Echo Show 8 and I am so happy with the purchase. I was nervous that it might be too big or too loud. The size is perfect and it sits on a night stand with a lamp next to the bed. The sound is amazing!!! The bass is also incredible! Best part is at night I don’t like the radio too loud and the Echo Show 8 has the perfect low sound too. The camera shut off feature is key. The dimming feature works great so the light doesn’t bother you while sleeping. I highly recommend the Echo Show 8 and don’t be afraid that it’s too much for a bedroom. You’ll be able to have a dance party during the day and listen to soothing music as you sleep at night. One of my favorite Amazon purchases to date!",5,1,2020-1-4,1,2,0
"I wasn't really expecting to be blown away by this item, and I'm really not. It does give you that futuristic feeling like your in the movie Aliens and Sigourney Weaver is calling you, getting you out of a sound sleep to make sure you're not bringing them back to study!! ha. First thing that came to mind when I used the Camera. Which is a nice feature, though 1MP, that's a little strange. Though it's pretty clear. But a little ""invasive"" with the drop in feature, which can be adjusted. The screen is VERY touch sensitive, which is good if you use it, and that's actually, rarely. Since the voice recognition is excellent.I find myself mostly using my voice most, since that's really what it's designed for. Alexa is integrated MUCH better and she it super responsive, compared to the old models. Almost overly so. The screen isn't really that bright which is good, and it's not a strain on the eyes. However I don't picture myself watching much on Amazon Prime Video on this device. For that it's really for the ""Kitchen"" area for people who spend time in their cooking, eating, or sitting working on something at the table. Then i can picture it being like a small TV in the background like from the 80's, when people use to keep up on their Soap Operas.",3,1,2020-1-5,1,1,0
"I received my Echo Show 8 today and it's already set up and I'm very happy with it. I bought a second one, as well, to give to my mother for Christmas. I intend to buy security cameras very soon to work with Alexa, and I just purchased smart bulbs to use in my home. I also have a 43"" TCL Roku Smart TV, which I can control, to some degree, with Alexa. I'm still figuring it out, but I've been able to switch from antenna TV, and open my Hulu app on the TV through Alexa. I haven't tried asking for a specific show or channel to play, but Alexa should be able to do those commands. The Echo is in my kitchen and the TV is in my bedroom, and they communicate just fine.I was in the cleaning mood tonight, and have been listening to some great Motown through the Echo Show 8 from my Amazon Music account. I'm impressed with the speakers and clarity. They're not top of the line, but they sound great, not at all tinny.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,1,0
"In the pictures, i was misled into thinking if i order this along with the blink camera system, i could use it as a baby monitor and then for home security once the baby didnt need it anymore. This is a HORRIBLE idea. Do not be misled. I will have the live stream up and as soon as the baby moves, it cuts away to a screen telling me movements were detected and i have to wait to tell Alexa to show me the baby again, wait for it to buffer and load... its truly a horrible design.  If you just want it to tell you the weather, tell you a stupid joke, or minutes after someone walked though your yard,  this is for you. But if you had the same idea i did let me just save you the trouble and send you back to looking at actual baby monitors.

"Since having an Echo Dot, and enjoying it, we added to it by purchasing the Show.

There are times when I am 3 feet away from it, and another device about 25' away picks up instead. Our acoustics of the room have not changed and I never had this problem with my last show (and only had to replace it due to the screen going bad).

Outside  of that, I wouldn't have them. Here's why:I like to cook.

"I was very skeptical about this here version of the Echo Show for a long time. I at last decided to gone ahead and buy it, still not truly knowing what I was getting into, even after a few videos by others whom have purchased it. The bass is awesome with no need for a Bluetooth speaker, I'm cool with the display as well as I have seen worst quality out there. This make my first Echo Show device and second Echo device in all this far. With that said, I am still very tempting to get the 10 inch Echo Show 2nd generation, especially after hearing the sound quality of the Show 8 HD in which looks very beautiful sitting atop my Trophy Showcase. One thing I love the most about Echo devices is the comfort of knowing they are always improving thanks going out to Amazon for that. The try Alexa down at the bottom of the screen isn't a bother to me. I take privacy extremely serious and the added shutter for the cam is a BIG plus. Setup for me only took about 6 minutes or less being as though I was only upgrading from my Echo Dot 2nd Gen. In which I still love of course. Eventually I will also be the proud owner of that Echo Show 10 2nd Gen. Until then, this will hold me. Update, this device is still going strong. I also love the fact that it hears me better than my Echo Dot. A few upgrades I would have like to have seen being as though this Echo Show is newer than the Show 2nd Gen, it should have came with a bigger screen but is still cool. I would have also like to have seen a screen protector that you can leave on because the screen does accepts fingerprints very well when touched. I love the fact that it also comes complete with a actual phone with dialing pad. It’s like having a network phone. Maybe one day 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 will offer free phone numbers like Google to work exclusively with Echo devices that will allow for not only making calls but receiving them to. This would make the Echo devices absolutely perfect. Another thing that I like about the Echo that I forgot to mention , especially this model, not only do you have prime music as a choice when using this device for listening to music, you can also connect your phone, laptop, iPad, etc to it using your devices Bluetooth and play your own music right through the Echo and Echo Show devices for a better listening experience. What’s even more, you have the controls right there on the Echo Show devices to play, stop and go to next song and back a song as well as song title and artist information right on the screen making it an even better choice to own a Echo Show device. As for me, goodbye stereo, hello Echo Show, money very well spent.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"So, I'm an admitted late adopter, as in I bought my first echo dot in late 2019. I loved the sound and ease to play music and ask questions so much I thought, ""Why not get an Echo Show? I'm sure it'll be even more fun than the dot."" Ummm....nope. For me, it basically does the same thing, but costs more and seems to understand my commands less than my dot. I have to repeat things WAY MORE than I do for the dot and, even more annoying, it seems to sometimes guess what I'm saying and do something 100000000% different than my request. Here are some examples:ME: ""Alexa, play songs by Anjulie.""",1,1,2020-1-20,1,2,0
"The Alexa is very addictive.  We started out by getting the 8"" Show for the kitchen, thinking that would be all we needed.  Then we realized that we needed Smart Plugs to actually control something.  Well you have to be close to a Hub for Alexa to hear you properly.  So then we bought a Dot, followed closely by an Echo.  The sound on the Echo was pretty good, so wouldn't it be perfect in the bedroom.  Let's get one Studio for the Living Room.  Now started a whole series of smart switches for the different areas of the house.  The first Studio sounds so good, lets get a second to make it a sound system in the Living Room.  I'm probably not done since there is still the T-Stat, Garage Door, and a dozen more switches to go.  I've spent my monthly allocation and have to wait a while to get more.  At least I'll have things to put on my Christmas and Birthday List.After the usual start-up pains, the occasional tight gang boxes, and figuring how to integrate the Home Theater into my existing TV, it has been pretty smooth and painless.  Each different Manufacturer seem to have their own integration APP to communicate with Alexa.  But they all operate pretty smoothly together.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,1,0
"This Alexa is not nearly as good  The older version, response time is awful. The speaker is in the back and you can't hear it as well have to turn up the volume twice as much. We still have the older Alexa and she's in a whole another Room and the it responds more than this one.  We constantly have to repeat ourselves and does not understand half the stuff that we ask for. I do not recommend buying this",1,1,2020-4-25,1,3,0
"There’s a lot of devices out there. Almost too many at times. But the good news is that usually means a lot of variety. The trick is selecting what works and applies to your needs without getting sucked into marketing and pointless features. With all that said, I’d say the echo 8 comes right where we wanted to land as a family.We originally purchased an echo 5 on Black Friday. While it’s great for the price, it’s small and the speakers are lacking when it comes to playing audio with any volume. The 8 definitely delivers over the 5 in terms of audio quality. Much clearer and robust.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,2,0
It is what it is... but what it is ultimately is pretty disappointingI’ve giving the echo show nearly 4 1/2 months to grow on me... and it’s superbly failed in every single aspect to do that. The end result of this device is a screen that is little more than a mounted Amazon advertisement.,1,1,2020-5-20,1,3,0
"The speaker sounds great for it's small size, nice big screen, & full Alexa capabilities. However one huge problem that will have me sending this back is that you cannot change the clock display. You are such with the small clock in the upper left corner of the screen. The only option I've found to make it larger is to turn on do not disturb. But with that on you don't get any notifications and cannot receive drop ins or video calls.I suppose shame on me for not reading the question & answers in the listing. I see that people have been complaining about this missing feature since last year when it came out to no avail. And I say missing feature because the Show 5 has many clock faces and sizes to choose from.",1,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
"The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size Echo Show for an area thats not too big, but still a main/populated area of your living space. The price of the full sized Echo Show runs $230 and $199 on sale, while the Echo Show 8 is $130 full price and $80 with free Echo Dot when on sale. The $80 price tag is insanely good for the speaker and screen quality.While I do wish it was more customizable like others have said as for removing the ‘Try This’ im sure it will happen eventually and every single person mentioning it is redundant. The Echo Show 5 is a worthless paper weight as for its speaker and screen size, its smaller then most current phone screens, and sounds like trash. As for a bedroom clock, or background music, or digital picture frame for the bedroom it may serve a purpose, it doesnt have a place anywhere else really. The Echo Show 8, while only being 2.5” bigger, is a perfect size for a main room that doesnt have a big enough space to dedicate to the full size Echo Show, or as a cheaper alternative, or as a secondary Echo Show. I will strongly recommend this to everyone interested in Echo Show devices, as I cannot justify more then double the price for 2” more of screen, and almost the same exact speaker performance this is the sweet spot!",5,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0
"The Echo Show 8 is a good piece of hardware marred by a software design that makes you scratch your head, largely because the numerous requests and feedback from users of the larger Show is largely ignored in this implementation.The display is great, the built in pictures are also great, and the scrolling weather, news and other functions work well.",3,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
I was very hesitant with purchasing this Echo Show 8 because I had never had an Alexa product and didn't want to risk spending money for something I didn't love. I essentially wanted an iPad for my kitchen to look up recipes and play music but didn't want to spend a fortune:PROS:,4,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"I've had Google Home and Amazon Echo (Dot) for the last two years. The Echo Show (8"") was the latest addition this year. I decided to go with the Echo Show because of it's integration with our Ring Doorbell. The sound is as good, if not slightly better, than the Google Home (1st Gen) that we have. I like the 8"" screen display. It makes it easy to read text such as recipes, etc. It also has a nice clear picture when viewing through the Ring doorbell. Alexa, however, seems to be much more finicky when it comes to giving instructions. For example, when I ask Alexa to ""Answer the door"" when the doorbell rings, Alexa asks me who I'd like to call and gets stuck in that mode (the correct command is ""Alexa, answer the front door""  or ""talk to the front door."" Also, it is a tad bit slow in doing so when I do give the right command. Easier and faster just to pull out the phone out of my pocket and push on the Ring icon. In the same manner, Alexa seems slightly less intelligent than Google in asking other open ended questions, which is why I am glad to have both available when I need them. I have the Echo Show and three Dots in or home along with 4 (generic) smart plugs for being able to program and turn lights on orally, very handy. Alexa integrated very easily with them. I have a couple of glitches that I can't explain though. Twice Alexa stopped recognizing all of them for a brief period (an hour or so), then the next thing you know they all worked again. It wasn't a network problem (they were still all connected) but perhaps Alexa was doing an upgrade or something, who knows. All in all, I am happy with my new addition.",4,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
"I had a Google Home, it was, at best, okay. But it can't compare to my new Echo Show 8.I found that when I ask it a question, it’s response on answers is far superior to what I was getting with my Google device. Plus it hears me better. The Google worked fine as long as I was sitting next to it but if I was on the other side of the room I had to shout at it for it to respond. That is not a problem with my Amazon device, I can use my normal speaking voice from anywhere in the room and it works perfectly.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,1,0
Wanted this so I could use the monocole app to view my front door cam. It's an IP cam that supports RTSP.Amazon wants to make it not ply well with other. Ok I'll buy others. Looks like a bit more $ but I'll go with a raspberry PI.,1,1,2020-5-27,1,2,0
"Love that it can be used with my Ring Doorbell! Even figured out how to mute the motion alerts part on all my Echo devices, so at 5 AM it doesn't scream out throughout the house that my husband set it off as he was getting the paper. Love the manual way you can turn off the microphone and the Camera cover. You can have privacy and make sure it's real.Lots of videos you can watch. Even YouTube! That got added as an app just after I set up my new Show. I do think they could do better with the videos offered. The Prime offerings are a bit weak when you are looking for your list, not all shows and not all episodes available. I figured out how to use one of the two possible browsers (FireFox in this case) and had hoped to be able to access Netflix, so I could watch ALL my shows on this Show, but nope, Netflix will not even work through the browser. That's a disappointment, but overall, I love this thing! You can add your photos from the Amazon Photo Storage as a slide show for the background, that's also cool! I am looking forward to how this thing gets updated and evolves.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,1,0
"I totally love this Echo Show.  I love being able to just sit in front of the TV and ask to see the front door ring device and up it pops and gives me the ability to see and talk to the person without running around looking for my cell phone or even if you hear a noise you can get a live view without going outside.  It does so many things alarm, timer, reminders, shopping list, jokes, music, etc., etc., etc... I find out something new that it does everyday.  Don't know how I lived without it. The only thing I would change is the way it reminds you that a message has been received (like a talking text) on the dots the ring spins yellow until you ask for your messages the show makes a sound and show you that you have a message on the screen but then it goes off and there is a little number in the right corner I find this easy to miss if you aren't in the room while the message is being received other than that I love it.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,1,0
Echo 8 was just delivered... what happened to the screen Amazon?,1,1,2019-12-7,1,6,0
"The Echo 8 may be getting a bad rap being in the middle of two other pretty cool Echo Shows. But for me, having multiple ""5s"" around, this larger screen and even bigger sound brought me joy. Video calling was great with the 5, but wow, video calling on the 8 is really cool and requires less shifting the device around to keep up with us folks constantly moving around. My only regret was purchasing this on a pre-order bundled with another Echo Show 5 at a discount. But ultimately, cost me a lot of money. Suddenly Amazon dropped the price of this one to less than $100. Kind of screwed all those who pre-ordered it at full price. Lesson learned - I will not be the early bird on new devices, because that ate my future Echo Show 10 money. Lo and behold, during Black Friday, the Echo Show 10 dropped to $149, and I jumped on it. A month later, and I am still frustrated with the full size 10 and have a return request open because it drops constantly and becomes unresponsive. The Echo 8 has blown the 10 away and sounds just as good. Disappointed in the full version, and loving the small one as a clock, the 8 has won me over as having the best of both worlds.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
"I wanted another Alexa device to complete coverage of my house.  I was intrigued with the devices with screens, because it displays song titles (I have had many issues when asking Alexa what song she is playing).  However, I heard that most Alexa devices with displays have terrible sound quality, and I wanted good sounding music throughout my system.  So I bought the Show 8 for $99.  The sound is pretty good- it distorts a bit when turned up very high, but for regular listening it is quite sufficient  It did group with my other Echo devices to make Amazon Music or Pandora play from an  ""all speakers"" group, with was one of my primary tasks.I really don't ""use"" the screen much.  And it is always on, switching between backgrounds I've chosen and adds for Alexa Skills, news clips etc.  At night, it switches to a dark mode, displaying only the time.  Also, t will not play YouTube, which is disappointing.  I'm not sure I can recommend it, especially if you aren't going to be using the large screen often.",3,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0
Infuriating device. I thought it was supposed to be designed for video calling between amazon accounts/devices but apparently it’s not. Something so basic just doesn’t work. Little to no guidance or help documentation. Forced to rely on outdated and incomplete third-party guides. Adding accounts to contacts and then asking Alexa to video call just calls “the mobile” device like a normal call.,1,1,2020-6-24,1,3,0
"I own an echo show 8, an old echo, three echo dots, and an amazon tablet.I unplugged my show today.  The constant ""suggestions"" used to be in a small font on the bottom of the screen.",1,1,2020-6-20,1,3,0
"I bought this, pretty much on a whim, as a Christmas gift for myself. I can't believe how good the Echo Show is. The sound quality is amazing for such a small unit. But the standard Echo sounds fairly good (though not as good). Do I really need a video screen? There are two big pluses to having the screen. Being able to make video calls to friends and family who also have an Echo Show is a nice to have feature. But what I really love is loading all my photography into Amazon storage and having the Echo Show shuffle my 50 years of photographic memories in a continuous picture show. In between the display of personal photos, the unit displays news and weather updates from your favorite news source. I placed the unit next to my recliner, so while I'm chilling out reading or watching TV, I can glance over to the Echo Show to see a personal photo I had totally forgotten about or catch a news update.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,1,0
Just received the echo show 8 todayFirst impressions:,5,1,2019-11-29,1,3,1
"We personally LOVE the echo show! We stayed away at first because of the reviews about the “ads” it’s shows- but honestly there’s nothing inconvenient about them! I like that world wide things come across the screen, when our packages will/have been delivered, news and suggestions of “Try, Alexa....” and comes up with with different ways to use Alexa! The music plays really well on it, i love being able to ask Alexa to play music while I do dishes or cleaning around the house, especially when i can ask her to play a specific song! Even the suggestions on “learn how to make this food!” Which gives us more suggestions on foods I haven’t even thought about. Plus the weather for the day and just minor things Alexa can do! I think it’s great it rotates with different things and we can still see the time at the top corner. I’ve been recommending it to everyone! Main reason we bought it was so we could see our ring cameras and the quality is amazing! (Note: we started with the compact version and didn’t love it, only because it was so small. The 8” is way better and we love it so much more!)",5,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0
"It fits perfectly where I wanted it to sit. I've been using echos since the 1st one. Not to mention, kindles (1st gen & newer), paperwhites (1st gen & newer) kindle fires (1st gen & ...), fire HD's (yeah, etc), sticks, TV's, echo dots, auto & buds. So, not much of a change or anything new for me. I keep buying them, along with, light bulbs, switches, whatever. I would take that as a positive endorsement. But, with this echo, I can watch twitch on it, while gaming, with just my voice. Unlike, my 1st gen echo that has been in here since I bought it. You know, no screen. I didn't get the 5 inch, my Razer phone is bigger & better in every way over that one. Yes, Razer, not a motorola razr. 5.72-inch, 120Hz screen at 2560 x 1440, dual front facing speakers with individual amplifiers & Dolby Atmos. The 10 may have been OK. I almost pulled the trigger on that one, many times. But the 8, seemed better, for me.It just works ... LOL  Uh, Alexa, open Skyrim...",5,1,2020-1-30,1,1,0
"Updated as of 1/20/2020Major downfall is that the dashboard/home screen doesn’t show the date. For either the show or the show 8. I’m deeply disappointed with that. As what states below I have my parents my first gen show. Both of them have memory issues. I was hoping it would help reminder for calendar events and etc. however. They both are Constantly Complaining about the units not showing the day or the date. So they’re constantly asking the unit what day it is and what date it is. Which after looking up information I’m only seeing the show 5 that shows the date doesn’t make since especially due to the money that’s paid for these products. I’m highly disappointed with that and because of this issue alone with the regular show and the show 8. Not displaying the day and date on the dashboard/home screen I have to give it a 2 star. My mother’s at the point of not remembering to say Alexa show events or show calendar, which is a huge downside of me giving them the show in the first place.",2,1,2020-1-14,1,1,0
"Piece of junk built for smart phone addicts - worthless - nice paper weight... Only useful thing it does is a timer to wake me from a nap (and I have a cook timer that does a better job and for only $4). DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME - MONEY - LIFE on these vice-ridden devices. Anyone interested in them NEEDS TO GET A LIFE (and get over yourself). Alexa(ndrea) is designed to lure you into a stupor and let you wither away and run astray.

"It seriously needs to have a customizable clock face. And if nothing else, at least the same amount of mics as the Dot, or even the Auto.It's honestly less useful than the Dot. Just a background with advertisements on what kind of stuff to ask Alexa. With so few mics, it hardly ever understands what I'm saying, which makes navigating what you do manage to get on the screen impossible. It often just gave up and opened the browser and searched YouTube for the words it thought I said. And for the single most useful feature I bought it for, it is impossible to video call any other Alexa device except for the Alexa app on my phone. Unfortunately, I don't have a need to video chat with myself from inside the house.",1,1,2020-2-2,1,2,0
"I own a Echo (1st gen), Google Nest Hub, Ecobee 4 and echo dot. Just recently got this. This is the my lest liked smart device in of the previously mentioned devices that have voice recognition. Alexa is not as intuitive as Google for voice integration for me. The larger screen of the show 8 is something that was suprising to me. I actually like it less than I do the smaller screens on the google Nest Hub and show 5. I got it because I thought I wanted a bigger screen and a better speaker. Both of these reason didn't pan out. If I wasn't so lazy I would return it for a second Google Nest hub or a straight echo speaker.The Far field mics on most Alexa devices are great including this one. Generally they have been better than Google devices in my experience, but what Alexa does with what you says has fallen behind google in my opinion.",2,1,2019-12-28,1,2,0
"Let me first mention I have no clue why so many people are complaining about the recommendations that are provided when you aren't watching something on the echo or asking it to provide a function. Maybe it's changed, but I only see those when I'm not using the echo, at which point I tell the echo to turn on the display and it all goes away. Not something that should be complained about in my opinion.I love the echo for what I use it for. It's in my kitchen and I turn on prime video while I do my normal routine and while cooking. I feel it makes my kitchen time more enjoyable. I have yet to use the recipes features, but I've heard it's very convenient. It does everything I wanted it to do, so for me it's worth every penny.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"We have about every Echo device from the Echo, Echo Plus, a ton of Echo Dots, and even the Echo Auto, and throughout all of the generations.  We are fully integrated with the system.  This one is by far the worst ""listening"" and worst sounding Echo of all of them we have.  I can stand next to the Show 8 and say ""Echo"" and my Echo Dot from the next room (over 25' away will answer and this one will not.  There are often times I have to say ""Echo, Echo, Echo"" before it will finally go ""ding"" and listen to me.  I do like the screen and the added functions that offers but the mark was missed on this.  I have friends with this product that have the exact same experience as we do.  The sound is better than a DOT but only marginally.  Not anything close to the Echo Plus or the standard Echo.  There really is no comparison.  Hopefully it's a software issue that can be resolved and not poor mic placement.  Also, the only thing I don't like about the screen are the terribly annoying ""try this with Alexa"" messages.  And there is NO WAY to turn that off.  Come on Amazon, you are better than this.",3,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"I’ve had real problems with Alexa understanding me. I don’t speak with a heavy accent (maybe Alexa thinks I should since I live in Southwestern Virginia). Grew up in Pennsylvania and if any would have a Philly accent. But I think I’m pretty neutral.Also, I put the show in the kitchen because I thought it would be a great assistant for recipes. It’s not bad at this, but I’ve had a hard time getting Alexa to search websites more broadly as Google does. Seems most focused on just a few food websites which limits its ability to find recipes I know exist (and would like to add to my favorites).",3,1,2019-12-18,1,2,0
"Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is something that I bought specifically to watch the streams from my Wyze cameras.  It does that very well but it is the “Try, ‘Alexa ----’ “  feature that some people find annoying that I like so much that I purchased a second device.The screen changes with different news items or informational comments and across the bottom of the screen a tag line shows the exact phrasing to use if one wants to know more.  This helps to avoid frustration when struggling to phrase a question or command that Alexa will immediately understand.  The “Try,’ Alexa ----’ ” is also a great prompt for those who are just getting used to AI and not quite sure of how to use it or what to say.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,1,1
"Love this Echo Show.  It has a  much larger screen and I can easily read it from across the room.  The only issue I have is that I am disappointed with the Upgrade and Trade-in discount which offered me $30 instant credit if I sent in my old unit.  My old unit sat untouched on a table for a year.  It was like new out of the box when I sent it in.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and newspaper and dropped it off at UPS.  Now they rejected the suggested $30 discount and have charged my credit card.  The reason?  Scratches.  Absolutely no way there was a single scratch on that unit.  I'll be interested in seeing the condition it's in when it is returned.  I won't every use that Ugrade and Trade-in offer again.Update:  After a couple of weeks I just received my old unit back.  I was anxious to see the ""scratches"" that they claimed were the reason they didn't accept it.  Of course, there weren't ANY, not a single scratch.  But the best part, wait for it... is that they returned it without the cord.  So now, if I want to sell it I have to buy a $15 cord for it.  This trade-in program is a scam and I am really surprised Amazon is okay with it.  Basically, they lure you in with a higher amount and ask you to ok ahead if they feel it is worth less (which it always is, I'm sure).  If like me you don't agree to take a lower value then they just ship it back to you.  Beware!",4,1,2019-12-31,1,1,0
"I used to have an Echo Dot in my bedroom, but because of the great deals over Black Friday, I decided to pick up an Echo Show. The whole endeavor can be summed up in one word: Why? Why put a video screen on something that only needs audio? My NPR News briefing didn't get much added value from a 10-second video intro of the hosts, or from the B-roll footage they played while the reporters were talking. There's no Netflix browser. No YouTube unless you want to go through the crappy web version. No way to easily play slide shows of interesting things. I would have loved to say ""Alexa play a slideshow of nature photos"" or something like that... but that only works if you go beforehand to your Amazon account and set up a photo album of nature shots and then invoke that specific album. Why? There is so much wasted opportunity.Plus I didn't like how even at the lowest brightness setting, it was too bright for my room at night. I ended up turning off the display at night entirely -- which made me question why I had ever purchased this thing in the first place.",2,1,2020-1-29,1,1,0

"Ive tried all the echos that have a screen and the echo 8 is more impressive than i was expecting. The echo 5 is a great alarm clock replacement. The size allows it to fit well on a night stand and its handy for smart device control, podcast, video chat but its limited in what videos it can play and the sound isnt anything to write home about. The echo 8 breaks free of all the negative aspects of the echo 5. If you are looking for something to watch video on and listen to music the echo 8 is a much better choice. The volume is louder and the bass is surprisingly good for this type of device. You can feel the bass. It also playa hulu and more video options than the echo 5. Its not a fire tv replacement as not all video apps work on the echo shows. The big echo obviously has a larger screen and its significantly more expensive. If watching video is your top concern stick to the 10 inch or the echo 8. If having a bedside smart device to control smart devices, wake you up and use for communication the echo 5 is the best option. The echo 5 is surprisingly unobtrusive on the nightstand where as the echo 8 is pretty noticeable. The echo 8 is a great value at the current sale price. If your on the fence buy it! You won’t regret it. I wish i had a need for another given the price.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,1

They can be difficult to find just the right gift for. This year my sister & I with Amazon’s help hit it out of the ballpark!Setup was simple and smooth. I placed all three units on my account, loaded up with lots of extended family pictures and access to Amazon Music. All three are enjoying talking with each other in a new way. They love seeing the many photos of other brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and their kids. Since visiting in person is difficult due to age and distance the Echo Show 8 is warming their hearts.

Wanted to love it. The Try quote always on the screen and the lack of customization forced me to return it! I can’t believe you cannot make the clock and weather full screen. I just want a background with the time and forecast that’s it. Anyways it’s up to amazon to update the software and that hasn’t proven to be anytime soon.

The way that recipes are implemented on here makes it next to useless for that purpose.  There are plenty of other reviews here (which I should have paid attention to) which provide details about all the ways this fails as a recipe device, so I won't bother typing it all out.  I'll just add my voice to the chorus of disappointed people.  We returned it.",1,1,2020-4-5,1,3,0
"Absolutely infuriating.  Doesn't matter what you do in settings, you cannot remove the ""TRY SOME ACTIVITY YOU DON'T WANT TO DO""  I want to look at the slide show images and the time, I don't want to be F#@#$ advertised to on the device I bought.  Google/Nest devices do not do this.  I got this device instead of the google home as we had dots around the house and I very much regret it now.Also, while we rarely had a problem with the Dots, doing Drop In to this often doesn't work and even if it does connect you will often only get a few words out before it gives some error message.",1,1,2020-5-20,1,2,0
"I really want to like this thing, it sounds great, looks great, works flawlessly for what I use it for. I use it every day, I have routines set up for music and lights, overall I like it, but there is one glaring flaw that everyone has pointed out already, the ads. Its not just the ""try this"" statements any more, those were annoying enough on their own, I saw a full screen add to watch anime on hulu on it yesterday! What the heck amazon, you make enough money off me without trying to shove ads on my bedside clock! I want a clock with alexa and a nice speaker built in, I don't need nor do I want to have a constant demo mode on my product with the ""try this"" statements, and I sure as hell do not want ads on it. And I also want a full screen clock option, instead of this crappy 1 inch clock on a freaking 8 inch screen! I'm keeping it only because it was a gift so I couldn't return it if i wanted to, but honestly with some basic programming and a $30 pi computer I could make a way better echo show, and thats probably what I'm gonna do. Don't listen to the reviews saying anything otherwise, they are paid and promoted because amazon doesn't want all the angry reviews trashing their product on the top.

I didn't want to pay double for 2 more inches and loose the ability to turn off the camera. The sound quality out of the box is quite flat, yet bassy. The equalizer fixes that really quick. I've seen reviews complaining about the sound quality, I don't see the problem. Yes it sounds different from the Echo 1st and 2nd gen, but it's built different. I have mine in the kitchen. I'm not sure how it would sound being the lone speaker in a living room. I couldn't find the browser at first. Duh, you have to tell her to open it, lol. Silk or Firefox is your choice.

"I was rather disappointed in the Echo Show 8"". The screen is big enough, and I don't really think you need a stand for it. I have 3 issues with it:1) I have several outdoor cameras and 2 baby monitors that are synced through the Alex app, however Alexa seems to have a hard to understanding my request to show me ""child-name camera.""

"The original unit had to be replaced before the end of the first week.  The  echo 8 kept cutting out especially when listening to news and music.  Instead of amazon replacing it with a new Echo Show 8,  I was sent a unit identified as refurbished.  How they could have refurbished units within days of the release of a new product is unclear.The replacement had a different problem.  After being on for 15 or 20 minutes, the Echo 8 refused to respond to an Alexa command. It simply stayed on with what was playing even when screaming Alexa right over it.  The Amazon technician I called couldn’t believe it either. We spent nearly an hour going back to the beginning with restoring to factory settings.  We agreed to keep it playing and have her call me after 30 minutes to see if the Alexa command could get it to stop playing.  She did call back as promised and, guess what, the fix took.  Alexa did her job.  I praised the technician for her expertise and effort and thought a new day had begun.",3,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0

"I bought this with a sense of guilt because I already had Echos in the bedroom and living room and Dots in the bathroom and den. But, am I ever happy that I made the purchase.  I placed it in the living room instead of the 1st generation Echo (one that I pre-ordered before any were even shipped!).  The sound quality was MUCH more to my liking,  The Echos, especially the Dots, sound rather muddy to me, even with my excellent hearing aids (I have high-frequency drop-off).  But, this 8"" Show is very clear, and it easily fills a living room-dining room area.  I like that the screen dims in a dark room, meaning that I might splurge on a second Show for my bedroom to get better sound.  I also like that when I play selections from TuneIn Radio, the artwork shows on the screen. But, there are times when I would like to just return the screen to a persistent plain one, like whenit shows time and weather.  That's my only real objection.  I am about to make a demo of Alexa products to a senior living community, and be assured that I will feature this Echo Show.  This is a definite BUY!",5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0
"Works great by itself as an Alexa device or as a tool integrated into a smart home with security cameras.With Ring you can see who is at the door and have a conversation without going to the door. With other security devices you have the ability to ""show"" the state or the video feed.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,1,0
"Excellent upgrade from first gen Echo Show. I use this in our master bedroom for typical Alexa stuff (controlling lights/lamps in our room, playing music, weather checks, “show me the front door” with Ring doorbell, news updates, so on). I can confirm the speaker and sound from Echo Show 8 is better in absolutely every way compared to first gen. This is obviously expected as Amazon has upped their game in audio. I have the second gen Echo Show in our kitchen and love these two Echo Shows. I think back to 2014 when I first got my hands on the original Echo. This whole ecosystem has evolved so well for the most part (they do have some duds in the line-up). If you’re considering the Echo Show 5 versus the 8, I would recommend the 8. It’s not going to take up nearly as much room as the Echo Show, and the difference in sound quality and extra few inches of screen versus the 5 is obvious. It’s a good in-between option and I’m thrilled Amazon launched this version. I was also thrilled to use Amazon’s trade-in platform to send in my original Echo Show and apply the gift card and discount toward the 8.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0
"We have had an Echo Show (1st generation) in our kitchen for years.  When we learned we could ""drop-in"" to see our grandsons we had to get one for our daughter.  It works great for drop-ins, looking up recipes, cooking timers in the kitchen, entertainment, and interesting facts.  It also works great when you need a dictionary, listen to audio books or check out who is at the front door.  No packages have been lost yet.  Try it...you'll love it!",5,1,2019-12-7,1,3,0
"I wish you could customize the home screen more. To include the digital display of the clock. I want to have it bigger on the screen and I want to be able to dim it or make it brighter. My old alarm clock had a bigger display and I was able to dim the clock to a setting I preferred. Not so with Echo 8.Sound is excellent, and screen is great quality.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"The picture and sound quality are excellent...I placed mine in the kitchen. It does everything you've come to expect from an echo device, but the video takes it up a notch. It's almost like having a easy to use tablet always available on your countertop.  I've only had it a couple of days, but these are a few of the things I've discovered it can do. When you play music, it sounds great and it usually brings up a screen with lyrics. It shows several temperature displays when asking about weather. It will link to your Ring doorbell and display the video from it. It opens easy to read recipes with a simple request. It plays music videos. You can pick what types of data or pictures you would like displayed on your home page. It also displays your Google calendar and reminds you of tasks. It can control all your smart devices with voice or touch screen. I'm sure there's much more, but I really like the look and quality of this. I'm definitely going to be picking up more for other rooms in the house.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"Really...They make an Echo Show with almost twice the screen size and make the clock smaller than what was on the Echo Show 5. Who is designing these things. The size of the clock was one of the complaints on the show 5, do they listen to people and correct it in a future version, nope let's make it smaller and really irritate people.  I understand the larger screen now makes it possible to watch netflix or hulu on now but face it most people watch that stuff on their TV not an 8"" screen. 99% of the time it will be used as a clock.  You can use the screen magnifier trick but as soon as you use the echo for anything it goes back to the small clock face. A huge letdown to what could have been a nice product. I have no confidence that Amazon will listen to people and make an option available, they never have on any other product they make.",2,1,2020-7-23,1,1,0
"Device is fun, many features, like watching movies, playing music with lyrics show.  It's a great size to fit on a desk or kitchen counter and the sound quality is pretty good, it has some bass.Some pain points:",4,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
"This was my Christmas present to myself. I'm a HUGE Alexa girl. I love that while I'm cooking that it can help me with a recipe (THIS DEVICE IS A MUST HAVE IN THE KITCHEN). I also love that I can watch a movie while in the kitchen now. I wanted a small TV in the kitchen but all of them that I found I found were just too big. This fits right on top of my microwave. The sound and video quality are amazing! I'm 100% happy with mine. As far as the ""Alexa, try..."" issue that people are having I actually love! It gives me some great suggestions that I would of never thought of. It's not intrusive and it's barely even noticeable unless you are looking for it. The device comes with a ton of options too. This is my first Echo Show but I'm 100% happy with it. NEXT COMES THE RING!!!! :D",5,1,2019-12-28,1,2,0
"Probably worth it when it goes on sale, and the quality packaging makes it a great gift. The hardware build feels excellent. The screen is bright in sunlight and automatically dims to a night mode when dark. Sound is different (I'd say better) compared to my echo. Drop-in and video calling features are pretty useful when communicating with family members; most of us put our phones on silent nowadays so another way to reach them is always a plus. I mainly got this to integrate with my Ring doorbell - so far so good (the Ring cloud is a bit slow sometimes, but that's not this product's fault).Cons: I put this in my bedroom, so my main use as part of my daily routine is to check the time and the weather before I leave for work. So I do wish the clock can be made full screen both normally as well as in night mode. I'd also like to be able to give it context (i.e. if it's between 7a and 9a, always show today's weather details, and show a large clock the rest of the time). These are simple software fixes, so hopefully it'll get rolled out soon because the hardware seems well made.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0

I can announce to my children that it's time to come up for dinner, I can operate lights throughout my home, I can see anyone who enters our long driveway and we can watch movie or listen to music while cooking with my kids.I have found the skills a bit annoying but I have also learned so much from Alexa displaying them.

"Amazon Prime Video stopped working just ""conveniently"" after the return period. This was one of the major reasons we bought this. Have even reset back to factory defaults as well as ensured had the latest update and tried various things again and again to no avail.  Nothing works. One would think that an Amazon manufactured product could certainly play its own Amazon Prime videos as was initially advertised.  I do not recommend this echo show or the echo show 5 if you mainly want to play Amazon Prime videos.  They are both complete failures in that regard.  I did not call Amazon to troubleshoot as I doubt there is a solution other than Amazon pushing out an update.  Furthermore, I feel I should not have to call Amazon as their own videos should work on their own product. Not happy! Smh",1,1,2020-6-5,1,2,0

I can look at my 86 year old Mom, and talk to her face to face. She likes that Alexa, can call my Sister and I, should she need us. Also, because she lives alone, she can call out to, or tell Alexa to call 911, and it happens. It really gives me peace of mind, to know that she is not alone, even when she is! The microphone is so sensitive, it can hear her from any room. 🥰",5,1,2020-6-16,1,2,1

We use her to power our tv, our lights, our door lock, nest thermostat, garage door, ring doorbell, absolutely love having a smart home with her to help!! This is a great, reliable option. Great gift for kids too! Love the camera cover option! :)) My younger kids have all their questions answered, alarms and reminders to keep them on track, chore lists, I can drop in and talk to them, and they have finished 2 books on Audible JUST since Christmas with Alexa! Use this daily for recipes during dinner. Thanks Amazon!",5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"So I’ll get the two flaws out of the way first. First is the same thing most people don’t like... the non stop “Ask Alexa...” prompts written across the bottom of the screen. There’s no way to turn them off. And they’re annoying and kinda tacky. Like we already drank the Alexa Kool Aid, stop trying to sell us. But anyway besides that it’s great. I’m apple products through and through. Then I got an echo dot with my fire stick purchase and we loved it. I have a ring doorbell, so I wanted it to work with that, and auto show me the doorbell instead of having to look at our phones. And it works great, kind of. You still have to say “Alexa show me the front door”. Kind of frustrating that it’s already communicating with the doorbell. It rings and tells you someone’s at the door. Why can’t it auto show the camera feed when someone rings? Hopefully a future update. But all other aspects of it are great. Screen looks great. It sounds great. It’s the perfect side to be by my front door table. Super easy to set up. Just fix those 2 things!!",4,1,2019-12-15,1,1,0
"Bought this for myself. I already have an Echo Show and the Echo Show 5 and love them. The Echo Show 8 is a perfect compromise between the Echo Show and Echo Show 5. The larger 8 inch screen is great if you have poor eyesight and the sound quality is amazing for a device of this size. We started out placing an Echo in every room; now, we have Echo Shows in 3 of the 5. Amazon has done an excellent job continuing to update and add features to the Echo Show. And, what’s more, they play nicely with just about every product out there. I cannot say the same for the competition. We have a few of those devices as well. If you’re thinking about getting one of these, just do it! You won’t be disappointed. In a few weeks I’m sure I’ll hear my family members saying that they love the Echo 8s we got them for Christmas!!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0
"I was looking for something that would allow family members to communicate with my 96 year-old father-in-law, especially during the pandemic.  The senior living facility where he stays had pretty much shut down once Covid-19 hit the States.  We could still talk with my father-in-law via cell phone, but due to his advanced age, it was getting harder and harder for him to remember how to correctly use a cell phone.  The senior living facility also allowed for Zoom calls, but we had to schedule those ahead of time.After doing some research, it seemed as though my options were pretty limited until I started looking more at the Amazon Show.  I was intrigued by their Drop In feature, which allows you to do a video call using the Show and a cell phone/tablet that has the Alexa app loaded onto it.  The nice thing about it is that the person who has the Show doesn't have to do a thing when they receive a call.  They just need to stand in front of the Show so that they can be seen.  The Show has a short time period (5 seconds or so) where the person originating the call is shown a fuzzy screen while the person with the Show hears a chime to let them know that someone is Dropping In.  This allows for the person to scoot out of the view of the Show if they are not presentable.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0

"I wanted to add another device to my house so I upgraded with the Echo Show 8 to replace my 1st generation Echo Show. I moved my older show to the other spot in my house that I wanted to have a device with it's capabilities. The first thing I found is was a bit hard to get my Hue lights connected to the new device. Actually it might have been too easy which caused issues. I have had to delete my original lights twice to get them to work correctly. I had things set up for zones and it kept adding the lights over and over as new devices. I think I finally got it to work as I had it with the old Echo Show. Only time will tell. The second thing I noticed is that after so many people have stated their dislike for the ""Try This"" feature on the home screen that Amazon has still ignored the request to turn it off if you don't want or need it to be there. We need a switch in the settings somewhere on the Display tab to get rid of this if you don't want it there. Some people say there is a way to do it but trying each of their methods has been fruitless. It doesn't turn off. I'm thinking the ones who stated they contacted Amazon help and were told it can't be done are correct. Third thing I found a bit annoying is the power connection at the device. It's fine that you now have a connector plug instead of it being hard wired but it would have been just a touch more convenient to have a 90 degree plug instead of the straight plug. It sticks out a bit far past the body of the device and with the back end being longer already to accommodate the speakers it is a little deep and gets in the way.Overall the device seems to be a good upgrade. There must be a new processor which is speedier than the previous one because many things get done a lot faster than before. One thing I noticed is about four times faster is turning off the screen when I go to bed. The old one seemed to linger for three or four seconds but the new one goes off almost instantly. I think many other things are speedier as well. The Echo Show 8 is a good intermediate size, not too small and not too big. In fact it's new configuration gives me another inch of screen size in a body that is smaller in height and just a touch bigger in depth than the original.",4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0

"I wanted this device in order to study Spanish and it's a really excellent device but never could play the things that it promised on the screen.  It had stories that it offered to play--in Spanish--but couldn't play them.  I called and talked to somehow in December-shortly after getting the device and he said that feature wasn't available yet, so I was patient until last week--the middle of February--when I called again.  This person discovered that not only could it not play the stories in Spanish, but she had me change it to English and it couldn't do it in English either.  She said she'd call me back in a day or two with a solution.  A week later I realized that there hadn't been a call and probably never would be, so I called back and this time, Lance offered to send me a new device, which he did. In the meantime, after Janelle had had me update my current device, not only did it not play the videos, it took away one of my favorite features ""Explicame also en cincuenta segundos"" which is tell me something in 50 seconds.  My new device came today and it plays the stories from the screen (videos)--reluctantly-I have to touch the screen because it won't play it first time around from a voice command, even though it says it will, but it's an improvement. It still won't respond to ""Expicame also en cincuenta segundos.""  Is there any way of getting that back?  Also, they sent me a refurbished unit.  I don't feel well taken care of by Amazon Customer Service in some ways--especially considering that I've spent almost exactly five hours on the phone regarding this--much of it on hold. listening to the same, repetitive song over and over again and having to hear over and over again how important my call is. Why repeat that over and over?  I got it the first time and don't need to hear it again.  Also, isn't Amazon able to come up with a little more variety of music?--or offer ""no music"" the way Apple does?March 1st—I’m going to change to 5 ⭐️ if possible because now the device does play the advertised stories on the screen upon request and though it still no longer has the “ Explicame Algo....” feature, it has added new features to ask. Of course this device could be used in English which is a quick easy option change, I love so much the fact that Amazon has added the Spanish language as an option to the new echo devices.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0

"My sister bought our family this as well as one for herself and one for our Dad so we can all video chat. Since it has other capabilities I gave it 5 stars. I’m new to using Alexa and personally I like it, it’s nice to ask a question and get answers rather than search on the internet myself. So my review will be broken down in certain sections based on what I use this for: The unit itself, Alexa, Amazon services like audible and Amazon prime features, and the video chat.The Echo unit: it’s maybe the size of a smaller tablet, a little awkward shaped and I will probably look for a stand for it. When video chatting we had to prop something behind it to tilt it downward because the screen kind of faces upward. The device has to always be plugged in so you can’t carry it room to room without unplugging and plugging it back in. It does need a WiFi connection so if you’re connection is slow it will affect live video, but didn’t seem to affect other content like playing movies, books, or music.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0

So far it has been great. I was able to set it up in under 1 minute. I really like the way the screen goes completely dark when you turn out the lights. Besides all the capabilities you would expect from an Echo, you also have the ability to display your photos, watch videos and movies, monitor & check home security cameras (e.g., RING, Arlo, Blink are ones I can confirm), check on loved ones, etc.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"we started out years ago with the first echo and since have several generations of dots, echo plus, show 5 and this the 8"" show. as with its smaller cousin this unit works the same, does the same things.you can watch prime vids. you can use it as a clock. easy vid calls or even intercom within your home. you can manually block the camera if you don't want that aspect. if running a timer you'll not only hear it when its done but in the upper right corner of your home screen you'll see it counting down.",4,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
Apparently Amazon is having problems with their Echo Show 8 which is why I'm having to wait until after Christmas for my second Echo Show 8. The one I got today was defective right out of the box.I have to admit I was very surprised and sadden as I love my Echo Show 5 which works like a champ. I'm not sure why a larger version should have problems but I wish now I'd bought another Echo Show 5 instead as I would have a working unit for my living room now instead of a defective one.,2,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I’ve never had an echo show before, but I’ve had plenty of echoes, but this one is beautiful in appearance, bright beautiful screen that has so many options, but the one detractor that is ruining the device is the constant rotation of “try this“ over and over and over again. Ruining the device for so many Amazon customers. This feature needs to have an option to turn off for this product to be a five-star product.  Also there are no options for different clocks to rotate, just whatever the default is set by Amazon. There should be options like an Apple Watch that you can pick different time themes to your taste. That’s another detraction. Fix these issues and you will make many happy Amazon customers!",2,1,2019-12-14,1,2,0
"Very disappointed, it doesn't connect to ring service through the skill, so I can't watch the ring cameras that I have around the house. That was one of the main reasons why I bought it. I have contacted Amazon about the problem and I have talked with a service tech that acknowledge the problems but was not able to solve them. I was told that they would keep in touch with me but after the second unsuccessful phone call I haven't heard back....Maybe Amazon is just trying to avoid a return",1,1,2020-1-5,1,3,0
"This is a quality product.  I do like it, but it would be nice to see Amazon listen to its buyers regarding features.  Hardware is solid and build well, screen is great, sound is good, but software is where Amazon fails its customers.  It is difficult to implement videos like Youtube, you have to go through a browser, which is a pain.  Also, which is ALMOST a deal breaker as it is so irritating, that is you CANNOT remove the Try Alexa notices at the bottom of your screens. Several reviews say it can be removed by going into settings and turn it off, but that is NOT true.  I have done that, turned every help, notification and option off....it is still there.  I have the newest software version, and it apparently is something that Amazon insists will be there, even though they are aware that everyone hates it and some people return their device because of it as well as others will not even buy it because they know that Amazon feels that they must shove this down the throat of those who give them money and pay their salaries.  Whew!  I guess I vented, but it really is a huge irritant that Amazon knows their customers absolutely do not want, but still force on them.  I will keep mine, because I do like it, but I do not encourage others to buy it if this type of belligerent Amazon behavior is too hard to swallow.  This should be an easy choice for the client, not be a forced display item.  That is why I gave two starts vs 5, If the Try Alexa was gone and YouTube easier to access, it would get 5 because it actually is a nice device otherwise.",3,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"Amazon has had thousands of complaints regarding the ""Try Alexa..."" banners, and they have ignored all of them.  These banners ae truly annoying and cannot be turned off.  I had to contact Amazon (not easy to do!) to get help setting mine up.  The online chat resolved my problem , but setup was a nightmare. I got locked into a loop where The Echo would not recognize my account.  I have been a Prime customer since 2011.  Will not connect to my Fire TV at all and I have given up trying to make it work.  Amazon integration is very poor.",1,1,2020-2-6,1,2,0
"The Echo Show 8 works just as described. The voice recognition is great, The screen is crisp and it works just fine, BUT. And that is a BIG BUT!!! It is a BIG data drain. Installing it has doubled my monthly usage. I have a 250 GB plan and I am struggling today to not go over my limit.  Normal usage without the Echo Show 8 was about 100 GB per month and has been that way for more than a year. But since I installed the Show 8, about 1 month ago, I am at 222 GB at this moment and I have 6 days left in my usage month. I received the ECHO Show 8 on Dec 7th, and installed it soon after that. I shut it down three days ago to conserve data.  So if you are on a data plan with a limit,, BUYER BEWARE!!!",2,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0
"Alexa show works great as an interface to Amazon / internet as you would expect. I am pleased with the quality of video and sound from the the  8 inch show.  I purchased the Show 8 with an Arlo doorbell for my elderly mother who  has trouble answering the door.  Alexa has provided my mother with easy access to news, music and  entertainment and is the main reason I decided to keep the system despite falling to meet purchasing expectations  as a doorbell system.  Where the Show 8 falls short is the integration with an Arlo doorbell.  In order to work with the Show 8 the Arlo video resolution must be lowered to the medium setting.  The HD video from the Arlo is not supported by the Show 8 and results in no video displayed  unless the Arlo door bell resolution is reduced.  There is a significan latency (delay) 20-30 seconds to connect to my Google Pixel 3 then 3-5 seconds delay in communication  after connection.  Latency with the Arlo to the Show 8 is a bit better  taking about 10 to 12 seconds to connect.  ( Wi-Fi router is between 15 to 20 feet from Arlo and Show8 )  Cannot configure the doorbell to just chime to the Show and must use the existing door bell buzzer. Arlo integration cannot not be set up to automatically open Arol app and show who's at the door.  User must instruct Alexa to ""Show 'MyDoor'"".  Arlo doorbell videos must be manually deleted  otherwise camera operation (including live view) will stop without warning because memory is full.  Therfore Operation of Arlo door bell with Show 8 is not elderly friendly  and requires frequent home IT support to keep functional.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,1
"I love my Show 5. I assumed that the new Show 8 would be an improvement. Instead it is a major step backwards. And the most disappointing part is that Amazon purposely did this and has thus far refused to rectify the very simple problems it installed in the Show 8. You can not use this product for the most basic function that I bought it for, a clock. It does not allow you to put a clock across the main screen. It does not give you the option to put the date anywhere on the face. And it will not allow you to erase the ""Alexa Try"" scroll at the bottom of the screen. Amazon's position is  that the ""Alexa Try"" features are not ads, but that is a moot argument because it is just as annoying as ads. I don't care if it is scrolling Shakespeare at the bottom of the screen, I should have the ability to disable it. Yet Amazon has so far not allowed it. And why, after all the multitude of buyers before me (unbeknownst to me before I bought the Show 8), would Amazon not make basic changes to a product that is so disliked by its customers? Amazon can make a simple software update to rectify all of the criticism, but they have refused to do so. The bottom line is that the Echo Show 8 has fewer basic features, is purposely annoying with its scroll, and costs more than the Echo Show 5. Quite honestly, the Echo Show 8 may be a harbinger for Amazon. Will the company react positively to the consumers' input, or will it continue along the Show 8 experiment and blatantly refuse to abandon common sense over its own agenda?",2,1,2019-12-19,1,2,0
"I got this because it said how well it went with Ring.  I put it in our bedroom in the event there was motion detected at night, i could easily take a quick look at the activity without having to find my glasses for my phone.  Well, it integrates with Ring, but do not expect to get anything more than a verbal  notification  as it will not connect with Ring's camera.  So, pretty much useless to me.  It does work and show other cameras i have, so maybe i need to put them next to the Ring's...  seems sad to think about.As a side note, The Alexa app, echo's and this show has failed me in many connections from August door lock to the current Ring issues.  I don't see the value that others see in these items.",4,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"Really like the Echo Show for the most part, but it definitely needs some tweaks. The main reason I got the show which I upgraded from my 2nd gen Echo Dot was to integrate my Ring video doorbell together. What I wanted was if someone rang the doorbell the Show would automatically pull it up. Well I found out later after buying it that's just not possible. You actually can do that with the Google Nest Hub, seriously Amazon? Get on that! You guys own Ring now, it should have been done long ago. I am able to give it a command, but I'd like it to be automated.The other thing I wanted to do was to use it as a big clock. Looking through the options, you just can't do that. After doing some research online, figured out it can't be done at all (and a lot more people wanted it too). Pretty surprising to me, that's not an option. What I want is the option to set the background to a still image, have a big Clock Face and nothing else on there. Right now I set it so the display is off outside of when I'm using it. Disappointing Amazon again.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"After over a year of using the Alexa (echo dot) ecosystem, the Show 8 was a nice edition.  The screen is the right size - not too small and not huge taking up too much space.  The display opens a world of options - from recipes to games to current events.  Some don't like the constant suggestions, but to each his/her own.  I like discovering new things and this is a nice way to stay informed.  The video capability is nice - my wife had to have one since I got one :-) and we can video chat when she's upstairs working and I'm in the basement working.  The audio quality is very good, tonal quality is not too thin and not too bass heavy.  Even comes with a built-in camera cover so you can close and disable video until you want to be seen.  May have to pick up more when Amazon Day or Black Friday rolls around...",5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0
"We've had a Ring doorbell for many years now. We started with the standard Ring doorbell and then upgraded to two of the Ring Doorbell Pros. The main drawback to using the Ring to answer your door is having a phone or tablet available and then opening the Ring app to be able to answer the door. This turned out to be inconvenient, so we rarely used this feature. Now that Amazon has purchased Ring and made the Echo Show work seamlessly with the Ring, the situation has changed for the better. Since we've purchased a Show 8, a person ringing our Doorbell Pro will now be spontaneously displayed on the Show. My only complaint is that the image shows for only about 15 seconds before reverting back to the background display. It would be nice if this stayed on longer (like 30 or 60 seconds). Of course it's relatively easy to ask Alexa to show the front door, which will bring the image back up (and keep it up indefinitely).  Basically, if you use a Ring doorbell, you need an Echo Show to make the system work well for answering the door when at home, and it does work well.Otherwise, I find the Echo Show 8 to be a very nice device. The music sound quality is fantastic, better than our other Echos. The image quality on the screen is also great. We use the Show as a digital picture frame with it playing our Amazon photos. These pictures look nicer than photos shown on our Google Home Hub, which sits next to the Show 8 (although the Home Hub is definitely satisfactory in this regard). We still haven't tried out all the other things that the Show 8 can do. Maybe some day :-)",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0

"(As of 12-25-2019)  I just received and installed the Echo Show 8 several days ago. It soon upgraded itself to the latest software. I had read many Show reviews, including complaints about the constant ""Things to Try"" notices on the screen. Also read a couple reviews that claimed to instruct how to turn this ""feature"" off.So, after getting the Show 8 going, there were the never-ending things to try on the screen. So I tried the steps others had earlier listed. NONE work now at this time.  Over several hours I tried everything, no joy.",3,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"The setup was easy, and for the last few days I have been constantly enjoying a new way of using the Echo. I am even listening to my Kindles on my Echo Show, instead of reading them. There is no text on the screen so I can sit back with eyes closed and sip on my scotch relaxing. Yes, you can do this on the Kindle too, but the sound is better and I believe more natural too. When I switch my “reading” from the Echo Show to my Kindle, or vice versa, the other product picks up the story where the other ended. It even goes back a page to help you remember the story during the pause in reading. The Echo Show even has the lyrics to some of the songs scrolling down the screen when the music is played. Simple commands like, “Alexa, what are my orders” show me the products I ordered in vivid color. I can keep on forever, but now the problem.It doesn’t work very well with my Ring door bell. I am certain I have it properly linked with the Echo show. My Alexa app on my cell phone shows it is linked, but I can’t get it to announce, “There is motion at your front door.” Nothing happens if someone rings the door or is outside. I only hear this on my other Echos and my cell phone. I can say, “Alexa, show me my front door and it will 75 % of the time show me a live view of the door and the person outside, but there is a lag and often the person is gone or is out of view. When I ask what the weather is, it will also display graphs of forthcoming temperature as well as indicators of wind, rain, etc. Much more comfortable have the sense of sight as well as hearing to grasp all this information. I feel I can live with this problem of not announcing motion at my front door. I still have my other gadgets doing this.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0

"Love the idea. Bought this so I could video chat with my aging mother out of state. It was simple enough to set up, except when it comes to doing what it is supposed to do, you are on your own to figure it out!  First thing, DO NOT IMPORT YOUR CONTACTS!!! You cannot delete them if something changes, like a divorce or breakup. All you can do is block them!! Next, sometimes it will call my cell phone, other times it calls my echo dot. It asks you which way you want to call the persons phone. If you want a normal voice call, it works fine. If you want the owner of the echo show to video call you, again sometimes it goes through Amazon and other times it doesn't!  To make a video call, you are supposed to tell it to ""call using amazon devices""  Well, when we tried this, it called my echo dot in Atlanta, while I was standing in my mom's house in Arkansas! Then we tried the same thing again, and my iphone rang like it was supposed to! The when we tried calling my wife's iphone, it asked about calling her phone, or Amazon devices, we chose devices, so..... it called the echo dot!

A number of times we cannot hear each other.  YES the mute button is not enabled.  We can see each other, but not hear.  Yet our devices can talk to us.  Restart.  Have had many video calls with it disconnected.  Sounds like a network issue - right?  NOPE!  Network is fine.  Restarted device - hey!  It works fine.  My other complaint is tech support itself.  What a major pain in the butt to get someone to work with.  Chatting is fine, but it's like finding a needle in a haystack to get to the chat support.  Clearly they want us to not contact them.I do have it connected to my amazon photos.  That is nice.  i had to disable all the ads and bs that Amazon sends out.

"After purchasing three Echo Show 5's, I thought I would take a chance with an Echo Show 8.  I read the reviews, pro and con, and decided a lot of smoke was being blown.  The unit came registered to me, and connected to my network without any problems, along with updating the software. The voice recognition software tailored itself to my voice without any problems, and I've yet to repeat myself. The display is crisp and the colors are excellent, and for those who complain about what is displayed that they don't want, get over it, listen to the excellent quality music it's capable of producing instead.  I like the changing backgrounds when it's idle and just ignore the ""Try..."" messages.  The one thing that really rocks is that lyrics are displayed for the vast majority of the songs that you might listen to, just think, you might discover something you didn't know about a song or two.  I can live with the changing clock (from center screen to upper left), but the advantage is knowing what the weather is like outside.  I will admit, though, that I liked the first one so much that I bought a second one.  You might find this is such a nice unit that you might end up with more than one also.  Would I recommend it?

"First,for the one glaring annoyance everyone seems to comment on: Older reviews claim you can get rid of the banner at the bottom of the screen that recommends various Alexa Skills to try.  That may have been possible at one time; it no longer is.  The one review often pointed to which provides instructions is not current - it describes Settings menus that do not exist as of the date of this review. I have found that turning off everything under “Home Content” reduces the frequency of - but does not eliminate - the banner.  Also, the banner appears while certain Skills are running (such as playing music). It’s a mild annoyance.Beyond that, I’m enjoying my Echo show. I purchased it primarily so that I could view the live video feed from my Ring Doorbell.

It will play music from prime, but will not open the app, and then it will just stop for no reason. It says it will play Hulu, but it will only play the main account holders videos. The potential is great, but I feel it has been a huge fail. We have been trying to work with it for 4 months but it is just an ok weather station at this point. Now it won't stop when we tell it too.

Well the thing is so stupid, it gives me recipes for things i didn’t ask for, answers question to things i didn’t ask, and its favorite response is “Im not sure about that”.  I even asked it if it could answer a simple question and it said “ Im not sure about that”. Sometimes it doesn’t answer at all!  Every morning I ask it to play the same radio station, and every morning it gives me the same WRONG station, completely different from what i asked for, then i ask again really slowly so it can understand the words that are coming out of my mouth...and it defaults to Tunin (And i cant find anyway to disable Tunin) and tells me that station isn’t available on Tunin and i have to tell it to get my station from IHeart radio, which is set as my default streaming service anyway.  Isn’t this thing supposed to learn?  So its back to googling stuff on the iPad, only way to get decent results.

I had that for 1 1/2 years, & it started jumping on screen lately & talking outloud to me when I didn't ask it to (room was quiet). I put that in living room where I practice guitar to jam along with it or to help me remember tune of song I'm learning. This 8"" rectangular Echo Show is lovely & the screen background constantly changes; Go to Settings, & pick the ""Wallpaper"" or background you want. There are 2 speakers, 1 on each side of the ""Show"" which helps the music really Rock, plus words come up for most part, which is cool. The only thing so far I don't care for, is the tone to Alexa's voice is very BASSY. I picked it up & held in my hands to see if it sounded better, but it doesn't. There is no knob to reduce bass or increase treble. Perhaps after a few days, it will straighten out. It has a nice big digital display of the date, time & temperature which I can see from bed better than with the ""Spot"", but I miss the Clock feature with the second hand, as I need to take my pulse for 15 seconds daily. I'll just set the timer. You can change sound of the alarm in clock in settings, & you can add your pictures from your cell phone or from Amazon Photos, if applicable, as well as several other things. Came with a little directions booklet. Anything you don't know how to use, just ask Alexa, or go to Support on your tablet or cell,etc. I'm so glad I got this. The price was reasonable & better than most retail prices I've seen.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"I've got several Echo devices...this is the first time I've had one with a video screen.  I received it as a Christmas present, along with a new generation Dot.  First, the Dot is VASTLY improved over previous versions.  The first Dots I had were pretty much useless without connecting them to a ""real"" speaker...the sound quality of the original Dots was pretty primitive.  However, this new Dot isn't bad at all!  I put it in my workshop and it's great for that application.  As for the Show, I really haven't used the video screen for much except for monitoring my Ring cameras, which works great.  The sound quality is better than the various other Echos I own (larger/stereo speakers).  I work from home and have the Show on my desk.  It's nice to be able to monitor my cameras for deliveries and so forth...and I pretty much listen to talk radio or music all day while I'm working.  Others have complained that constant content on the screen is annoying...and that there's no way to stop it.  It doesn't bother me...I don't sit around staring at it.  But I've found that you can tell Alexa to turn off the screen and it goes blank, without affecting what you're listening to.  I think you can also make it display your pictures in a slide show?  Anyway, like I said the screen content doesn't bother me, personally.  All in all, I'm very pleased with both devices.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I've purchased three of these so far, and will probably purchase more when the price-point drops again.  I gave one each to my mother and my mother-in-law, and kept one for use in my office.  I also have a full-size second generation echo show, two echos, and several echo dots, in almost every room of our house.  They are great for video/audio calls to grandparents/grandkids, for making announcements throughout the house, using as an intercom system, and working as a whole-house stereo system when you are home alone.  I tried the echo show 5 before, but was greatly disappointed at the quality of the speakers - they were tinny, and the microphones didn't work well either. At first, I thought it was just a defective one and sent it back for a replacement, but the replacement did the same thing, so it must've just been the design.  So, I was hesitant when I first ordered the echo show 8, but when I heard the superior sound quality over the previous echo show 5, I was so pleased that I ordered the other two for gifts.  Our kids and our mothers are all happy that they can easily make video calls to each other just by voice command.  I highly recommend integrating the echo dots into your household as well.  Our mothers have them (echo show and many echo dots) throughout their homes too, and it gives us all peace of mind knowing that if something happens and they find themselves in distress when home alone, they just have to speak loud enough for Alexa to hear them and help is on the way.  Thank you Amazon for improving the sound in these devices!",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
Picked up the new Show 8 to replace my original gen 1 Echo in the kitchen.  I have 5 dots and even a Show 5 and all do fairly well with voice recognition from around the room.  The Show 5 is not as good as the Echo or dots but still far better than the new Show 8.  It is so bad now and getting worse it seams by the day that I would return it if i could.

"After 16 years of marriage my husband I have arrived at a stage in our life where gift giving is no longer relegated to birthdays and holidays because we have the disposable income of an established couple with no children. In short, if we want something, we buy it. Christmas gift giving was once an ungodly stressful event  until we decided to stop with the gifts. This year however, I saw the Echo Show and decided to take a chance and surprise my favorite spouse with a present for his work office. He loves having family photos on display, but his iPad is old and does not always connect to the very secure office network and he enjoys playing music, but he needs to have his phone available for calls and his work computer is a PC and cannot hold personal files. The Show is really the perfect solution.When he opened the box his first reaction was suspicion because our house is currently overflowing with Alexas. We have so many Alexas in fact that there is an unopened Dot on our dining room table, we sent two brand new Dots to my brother and we have an older Dot that will be needing a new home after its replacement arrives next week. Once I started to explain the features of the Show a bit of excitement started to build. I knew I had him hooked when he plugged it in immediately and asked Alexa to play music and the lyrics popped up on the screen so he could sing along. ""This is pretty cool.""",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I got this to integrate with my Eufy wi-fi front door camera. I have it in my family room. I installed the Eufy Skill which integrates with my Eufy Camera app and Alexa. Now, if I get a notice that someone is at my front door, I just say, ""Alexa show front door"" and within a few seconds I can see the front door and who is there. I read some complaints about the delay in showing the front door... with any wi-fi camera, there will be a slight delay. In my case, the Eufy camera has about a 3-second delay and the Show has about a 3-5 second delay connecting with the camera. So maybe a 5-10 second delay total for me.The sound quality is quite good for a rather small device (I have the 8"" Alexa Show). Screen size is perfect for me - not too big or small. I have it connected to my Amazon photos to play slideshow. I disabled the ads in the settings - just say ""Alexa show settings"" to get to settings. I will eventually disable the Alexa hints that show at the bottom of the screen. For now, it is interesting things you can ask Alexa to do. The clock is a nice feature - shows time in upper left corner. When it is dark, the screen goes dark and shows time larger in the lower-left corner. When watching TV with lights off, the screen dims but still plays slideshow. Occasionally, I will say, ""Alexa turn off-screen"" and then I get a dark blank screen (no clock). I'm not sure if there is a way to just show a dark screen and clock - no slides.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I was one of the pilot customers for the original Echo, and our cylindrical friend continues to work flawlessly to this day. I picked up the Show because it was BOGO and, well, I was curious. The Show 8"" joins two generations of Dots and the OG Echo in the house, and while I am 100% against ""more screens"" I am also 100% pro Show. I love that it can act as a physical remote control for smart home devices so you don't have to blurt out commands in the middle of the night (although Alexa still responds ""ok!"" which is *super* annoying). The audio quality on the Show is actually pretty remarkable which is nice because I use her for music playback frequently. Related, it's kinda nice that when playing music from Amazon you frequently get lyrics, and that's cleared up some household discussions. And, I totally bought into personal photos as the screensaver, so it's fur babies 24x7 at my house. The activity/light sensing works great, and I love the faux sunrise that accompanies morning alarms. I have a couple minor complaints, but I suspect it's stuff I could tune out or modify if I really cared that much. So, clearly, I don't. I'm happy enough that if these end up on super-ultra-sale again I will probably replace the two Dots I have.

"I have deducted a couple of stars because of the lack of documentation.  There are several Kindle how-tos's on Amazon, but inclosed documentation is less than what you see in the item description.  It has many great features, but getting everything working right will be frustrating if this is your first Echo/Alexa device.  The first thing is that ""skills"" replaced ""apps"", and you will be disappointed if you are expecting this to look and feel like a touch-screen Android.  Essentially, it is a speaker system (Echo) with added video, controlled by voice (Alexa).  If talking to a computer is good for you, then this would be easily 5-stars if they provided documentation that you could at least print out on a computer.  Many, many features once you figure out how to use them, and the video and sound are outstanding.  Once I was able to add my SiriusXM and Hulu accounts everything is good.  I'm certain there will be many more uses in the future.  Unlike computers that you buy to solve a problem,  an Echo Show provides an ""Easter egg hunt"" to discover what it can do for you, probably many things that you would not expect.  For example, if you whisper to it, it whispers back.  Recommendation: When you buy your Echo Show be sure to order the how-to book at the same time.  You will need it.",3,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"My friend and I each own three Echo Shows .  A major ongoing issue has to do with ""Drop Ins"" to each other's homes.  There is NO WAY to direct Alexa to ""Drop In"" to a specific device at the other's house even though each device has a different name.  For ex, when I ""Drop into"" my friend's Echo Show, it always goes his livingroom and can’t be redirected to his kitchen.  When he “drops in” on me, the DROP IN call will show up on randomly on one of my 3 devices but it is unpredictable as to whether it will be on the device in livingroom, diningroom, or kitchen.

"I have been reading the Amazon Echo 5 reviews for quite sone time and trying to make up my mind on if I should buy it or not.  When I saw the pre-order starting for Echo Show 8 I was not sure if I was going to get it or not but I put my name on the list anyway.  Before the Echo Show arrived I planned on it just basically being a clock for me but I was wrong!  I had every plan of holding onto my alarm clock even after I set up the Echo Show in my apartment but it did not work out that way.  I saw the “skill” for this speaker to play my Apple Music so that was the first thing that I tried because I wanted to see if it had good speaker quality like my Wonderboom blue tooth speaker which is my usual way of listening to my playlists.  It exceeded my expectations and since I set it up I have not turned on my Wonderboom speaker at all which is amazing to me because I like quality sound.  Even stopping the music for a few minutes is easily done with a voice command.  I am, and have been a longtime fan of everything Apple.  I do have an Amazon Kindle Fire but thought that would be it for me with Amazon’s devices.  I thought that I would have as much of a “problem” as quite a few others had with the things that come across  the Echo’s screen but to my surprise it is not bothersome at all to me.  I have long liked Apple’s customer service and when I purchased my smart tv and my sound bar I saw that one of the services Amazon provided was customer support.  My friend had set up the tv and the soundbar for me and he relied heavily on this service that Amazon provided in setting it up with the soundbar.  While I was confident that I would not need to use this service when I set up the Echo Show I figured that it would be fairly easy but was happy that if a problem arises and I cannot figure it out that I could always call and find an answer from Amazon.  I saw that on Black Friday (today) that the selling price is lower than I bought it for ($99) but that was to be expected.  I just decided that I would write a review on this product since it seemed ironic to me that I chose Amazon over Apple in this type of device.  I was seriously thinking I would stay with my plan of buying the Apple Home Pod because of the critical reviews of “ads” on the Show but I see I am wrong with that.  Since I have set this unit up I see that it has surpassed my expectations because it is a great product that not only has great sound, it also has good clarity on the screen.  The only problem I have encountered with the Echo Show, and it is not much of  a problem, is to remember to say Alexa instead of Siri.  Since I have only a small efficiency apartment (400 square feet) I do not need another Echo Show but if I did I would not hesitate to purchase another one of these units.  For me to write something like this for an Amazon product it is a pleasant surprise because I myself rely heavily on all reviews because they are very valuable in deciding what to purchase since I am on a small fixed income and I figured there are so many reviews of the Echo Show that I wouldn’t have to bother with that but I changed my mind after seeing this is a wonderful product.  Thank you Amazon for giving such good quality for such a small purchase!  I would not hesitate to even buy one as a present for somebody if they wanted something like this.UPDATE-",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,1
"The 8 inch is our favorite size and fits well anywhere and still is a decent size for video. It responds better to voice commands better than my dots. Amazon nearly got it right with this, but there are a few things that make me hesitant to recommend it.Audio quality is close to the full size Echo, and a significant upgrade over the dot. Prime video and displaying simple commands is nice, using the browser to watch YouTube or do something quick online is doable, but not as simple as it could be.",3,1,2020-2-29,1,0,1
"Works great with my Ring doorbell. The Ring view outside comes up very quickly when I say ""Alexa show me the front door"", much faster than viewing on my phone. When I get a notification there's someone at my door, with my phone I have to first unlock my phone, then get to the app, then tap the app to open it, then click on Front Door Live View, then wait for the connection. So you can see the difference in speed of view right there. Echo show only takes a few seconds to connect to Ring. The sound on the Show doesn't compare to the sound on my Echo Plus, but when I ask the Show to play a song, the lyrics come up on the screen which is a bonus especially if you are a musician or a karaoke singer!  I recently learned you can slide the camera lens to ""closed"" which I did. I only realized you can do that because of the little tips the Show displays on the screen. I like that it always has the time and temperature, and suggestions of what you can ask verbally on a line at the bottom of the screen which changes every 10 seconds.  Show gives rotating on-screen suggestions for recipes, tending topics, 4 day weather, suggests videos, Show can connect with other Show users & is especially useful if you want to drop in on Mom to say hello or check on her visually is you have it set up that way. There really is no limit to the capabilities of Show. The only thing I yet have to figure, since I have both the Show and the Plus in the same room, is how to make my music play b only on the Plus if I don't need the lyrics since the Plus is such a better sound system.  I sometimes say Alexa play (this song) on the Echo Plus, & most times she will but not always. Then I'll try Alexa play (this song) ""Everywhere"" & sometimes music plays on all 3 of my Echo devices, & sometimes she tells me I need to sign up for Amazon Music to do that but I AM signed up for that.  I would like to figure out how to make my Echo Plus the default music player unless I tell it differently. I tried working with the settings in Alexa, that's where you can do it, but it didn't do it. I tried it verbally, to make the Plus the default. Nope. So I will continue to tell Alexa verbally to play it on the Echo Plus until I can figure it out. But having said that, I love the Echo Show, especially for it's very quick response to the Ring Doorbell Live visual!",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
First off I’m a huge audiophile and I would say the sound quality is very good. Much better than expected. Screen is also clear and bright and goes dark when needed so it works well as an alarm clock.Now for my complaints....Alexa can’t seem to understand me and it’s friggin annoying! If I ask to turn bed lights on don’t tell me bedroom isn’t supported when there is not one device named bedroom. Just turn the only device named bed on. Second the media displayed is annoying. When I’m in bed I really don’t care about a recipe on making cinnamon buns. Give me more topics of what I would need in the bedroom. Last why not an additional usb or two on it so I can charge other devices? Most alarm clocks offer this feature so why not the Echo Show?,4,1,2020-5-26,1,1,0
"We are so glad we purchased this Echo for our living room! It easily now the most utilized piece of electronics in our house!  From playing games when friends are over, to seeing who's at the front door and just playing some background music, this thing just fills in a lot of ""needed"" information in our room.  It was simple to setup and connect to our wifi. It was already linked to our account, and we used the Alexa app on my cellphone to enable the skills we needed it to perform and all our favorite things. My wife uses it as a picture frame for ""pictures from this day"" from our Amazon Photos and to keep the granddaughter happy with Disney tunes from Amazon Music. I use it for news updates (Alexa, what's my flash briefing!) and background music.  We love the trivia games we can play with friends and family.  And enabling it to work with our security cameras allow us to see who's around without having to get up. The screen is just right in brightness and resolution and the speakers, while not in competition with other ""high-end (and cost)"" speakers, does an admirable job at filling the room with decent sound.

"The Echo show 8 has some nice features, but as it... and the cube Amazon TV do not function interchangeably with the other echo products and do not seem to know what the dots in the same room are doing, it is a bit of a mess. Amazon has not made enough names available to name each of these in the same room differently. So If I ask Alexa to switch tv to hdmi 1, the alexa dot says it cannot find a playlist by that name. The Cube tv does not recognize instructions to 'play pandora Everywhere', and it does not have a pin plug to connect audio to my analog house system. If I ask one device 'what is playing', it may not know anything is playing if I told Alexa Show to play pandora everywhere. Echo Show executes tht command, but then cannot execute the command to cancel playing pandora everywhere. EVERY product should integrate as fully as the original echo and the original echo dots, and EVERY echo product needs to have a physical audio pin plug. Also, it is very annoying that the power supply to some is dedicated novel input. All Echo products should have the option for the same  usb power supply.",3,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

Who knew Covid would prevent family members from going into the assisted living places to help resolve these issues but for the money put out, just have Granny get a smart phone.

"I bought this because i wanted a dedicated bedside device i could use to monitor security cameras. I usually do this with my ipad or phone, but i like to use those for other things, so wanted something specially for that. So disappointing; The echo has a great speaker, but you cant play music and show camera footage at the same time even when the microphone settings on the camera are off. When Alexa plays music the screen only shows the song playing‘s album cover, not even the clock, or a rotating photo album. You can only show one camera at a time as well, even when camera app has multiveiw  capabilities. The touch screen is anemic, you have to download the alexa app to do almost everything, and most controls are through your phone. I feel i would have been happier with a cheap android tablet. I will say the speaker sounds great. But even on special, $89 is too much for what amounts to nothing more than a gadgety  alarm clock with a good speaker.. also though I have some cameras that do work with Alexa viewing anything by having to ask Alexa to show it, instead of just touching the screen is a tedious process at best, with no option to record or use the 2 way microphone. And the cameras that i bought it for(because they were advertised with them on the amazon website!!)  just buffer, rarely showing footage at all. If at the least it scrolled through the different camera views id probably be happy, but having to say “alexa show camera one“... “alexa show camera two” is pointless.

It's a great companion device that breaks the silence while you weave your magic cooking up the next meal. It'd be also useful in a laundry room where you are folding clothes while dancing to the latest Taylor Swift album. Wait, her last album (as of this review) is ""folklore"" and most songs are not really danceable to.Outside of that, the usefulness of the Ring and Amazon Camera integration allows me to see who's outside or in other parts of the house as well. Just need to make sure my son isn't sneaking in my beside table swiping a $20 bill from my wallet. Wait, where's he going to go blow it on anyway if all the bars are closed in our city due to the pandemic? Nevermind!",4,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"I own many Alexa enabled devices and Amazon products but this is the first time I found the need to post a review. I'm enjoying it so far however I wish it was more customizable between how the clock is displayed (my #1 purpose for purchasing this was for an all-in-one nightstand clock) to how quickly the information on the screen is transitioned. But what truly has caused me to write my first review so quickly was - for the love of God, Amazon - please turn off the constant ""Try 'Alexa'...."" suggestions. They're horribly distracting. When I viewed Echo Shows in the store I guess I foolishly thought they were in a demo mode for those suggestions to have appeared on the screen constantly. I really just wanted the ability to have a great sounding and great looking yet customizable digital clock on my nightstand. Feel I jumped the gun a little bit on this purchase which is sad because I'm now not sure if I plan to keep it or return it.",4,1,2019-12-4,1,2,0
Upon arriving the day after ordering I plugged it in and Bluetooth did the rest. It integrates my iPhone apps perfectly and opens my favorite podcast and music without a glitch. The sound is amazing. I am adding an echo speaker to the mix and my security cameras today’s. I tried the option to see the inside of my home from the camera on the Echo show 8 and was able to see my dogs being good while I was away from home. That is a real bonus to view inside the house when away. So far all is above my expectations. Also I accidentally ordered the 8.  My sister has a smaller screen size and thought I ordered that but mine is bigger and I am very pleased this happened. So I would assume the 8 means 8 inch screen and so on. All in all probably the easiest set up on a very useful item I have dealt with so far. I also added my Roku to the echo show so I just ask for any channel on my existing roku and I can watch tv from my Echo Show 8. Love the Apple Music and have 100 % accuracy on song titles and bands. Even when I am not talking super close to it or speaking as clearly as you think I need to.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"Alexa can play music from your music collection.  Yes, but only if you bought the music from Amazon.  If your digital music collection contains music purchased elsewhere, Alexa won't play it.  Amazon says that's for security reasons.  So the policy is not to force you to buy all your music from Amazon.  (Apple does essentially the same thing with its devices.)Alexa can read your calendar, email and contacts.  Yes, but only if you pay extra to access your mailbox if is on a Microsoft Exchange server, which is the most common mail server in the world.  Amazon says that's because Exchange servers are used by business.  Yes, businesses do use Exchange mail servers.

"I purchased this Echo Show 8 for a Christmas present for my wife at the discounted price of 79.99; which I think is a good price point. Given what I know now about this device I would be hard-pressed to pay full retail.  The reason? When querying Alexa there's a delay in response time and it doesn't seem to have the number of microphones as in our Echo Plus (I ""think"" the Plus has four microphones and the Show 8 has two). We have to be closer to the Echo Show 8 to speak to it than we do the Echo Plus.  Also, when we invoke the wake word for our Plus, the blue ring immediately pops up.  On the Show 8, the blue line at the bottom of the screen seems to take a bit longer.I'm not too bothered by the ""Try 'Alexa...'"" suggestions at the bottom, but I do hope Amazon pushes out an update to allow users to disable the text.",4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

This gizmo has made it possible to virtually visit with my parents on a daily basis. I can lay eyes on them and make sure they're doing well.

Not all are incoming producing for Amazon, but they are still ads.To those saying turn of Discovery in Home Content .. this has NOTHING TO DO WITH THINGS TO TRY!

"It's official, I'm an Alexa addict. It started with the Amazon Firestick. Then I moved on to the Amazon Echo, which replaced our Google Mini. When this thing went on sale, I debated for a couple of days, then decided to go for it. So glad I did. It is happily ensconced in the kitchen, where I use it to play music while I'm cooking, display recipes, set timers, and amuse myself with trivia games. When I'm at work and the dogs are home alone, I can ""drop in"" on them using this and let them know Mom is thinking of them. If I need something from home or for the fiance to do something, I can drop in with a quick message that he actually hears (unlike his phone, which he usually has set to vibrate).Some people complain about the Alexa skills that scroll across the bottom of the screen. I like them, and use them to learn more about the world. Alexa has access to so much knowledge, why wouldn't anyone want to learn more? It's not like it takes up a huge part of the screen. Technically speaking, I have the unit turned up to about 30% of the volume, and it is plenty loud for my music. If my neighbors ever have one of their parties til 3am again, it might get turned up to 100 at 7am, just for our amusement.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

After searching online and trying everything I could find, then chatting with Amazon for over 45 minutes, apparently I have a defective unit and can’t get it replaced for 2 weeks. This was a gift I wasn’t originally thrilled with as I didn’t see enough value in it compared to my echo dot, and now I’m down right annoyed and wish I wasn’t given it (not being ungrateful, just becoming more of a hassle than it’s worth)",1,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0

"I bought the 5 inch on Prime day. I like it. It's a great bedside clock and it does things that need a screen, like finding a book or music playlist. But the screen is small. The 8 seemed huge when I opened the box. Just huge. But it's a very nice screen, and very suitable for the free Prime Video stuff. I think the overall experience is getting better. With the screen, I can find Audible books fairly easily. The books synch  pretty well with my smartphone. I like that there is no downloading, they just stream. A lot of the videos that come up are interesting. You can hone things to what you want like the stock market or NFL scores, etc. If I want to hear a song, I can generally just ask for it, but it helps to have the Unlimited service, not the free one. Sometimes when I ask for a shopping suggestion, I get really good and in-depth information. But not always. I use it in the kitchen, so it's great for timers and I'd like to find good recipes. It was worth it, for me. Honestly, my $25 Dot seems pretty worthless now. The Dot had decent audio, but this is quite good. My outdoor video cameras come up OK on the Alexa Fire device, but not so smooth on the Echos.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"I use this in my bedroom, right next to my bed. Alexa picks up my voice without fail, but then again it is usually 10 feet max away from me. Another part I love is the camera. It's not just a simple on/off button that keeps you guessing if anyone could be watching, it's also a shutter. Alexa has plenty of skills, way more than I need, and I can play music and watch NBC, tubi, Prime Video, Food Network, Hulu, and Red Bull TV. But be warned: if you want Spotify, you need Premium, which is well worth it. And guess what? I haven't even gotten to the best part: the speaker. This speaker takes the cake! I live in a very large household, and my bedroom is at the very top of the house. When the speaker is only at half volume you can hear it all the way downstairs. WOW! When it's a full volume, it almost feels like you're listening to a concert. Get it right now while it's on sale! I bought it for a song and was not disappointed! 5 stars on everything for this! Highly recommend!Edit 6/26/20: I've had this for over a month now, and everything is working well. Although Alexa does have a couple problems playing songs I ask her to play, I haven't been able to not play a song after numerous attempts. And for the record, I don't really mind the Things to Try on the bottom. I sometimes actually find it helpful, and I don't normally look at it, so it has no effect on me.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0

"I used the Echo Show 8 at home office for a while and then took it to work to use in my office for listening to music and also to have my family and travel scenery pictures rotate on its display. It was a really nice touch that pictures on Amazon Photo can be shown on a rotation on this device. The sound quality is good. It is not very high quality, but it is definitely not bad either. The display is really good and many people in the office have commented on the quality of my photos. The reason I took one start off is that sometimes the display stops on one picture and seems to have locked-up. But the Alexa voice part still works. The only fix I have found is to reboot the Echo Show by disconnecting and reconnecting the power. Then it works fine for a few days until this happens again randomly. Other than that, it's a really nice device. The Alexa voice recognition works really well also.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

Being so far away from her, this device makes me feel like she is in the room with me. The sound seems to be the only issue at times. It will not always pick up her voice. Still better than WhatsApp.  I like that you can delete voice interactions, and that you can cover the camera.  Alexa wishes me good morning and guards my home. Ask her to play music tell a joke,a story or play a game and she will. Im gonna ask her to make my bank account grow, just to see what happens😉 Alexa gives me a round of applause when i come home. She listens better than my husband at times. It is a great way and user friendly way to keep in touch. You will need to buy a stand for it.

"So far about the best use of the show is for things I can already do on the dot.  Adding a picture and a lot of nagging ""Did you know you can ...?"" does not make an improvement over a dot.  The only actual *use* for a screen is youtube, and that's gimped because of the apple/google fight.  I can't use the screen to queue amazon music, only press pause or play on what's already coming out.  I can't see a list of anything from TuneIn only say play or pause for what I queued by voice.  I can't see my DISH dvr recordings on the side, only say play or pause as if it was an echo.  I can't select or play from my Washington post subscription except via the website.  I can't, I can't, I can't.....I didn't expect the world, but if you're not into picture slideshows this is so far great potential, no results.

"I'm finally getting around to writing a review. I bought this for my father who was in the nursing home on palliative care as a way to ""drop in"" on him as (due to distance and family obligations) I wasn't able to visit him more than once/week. Then the pandemic hit and the nursing home went on lockdown. I was no longer allowed to visit him in person BUT this device allowed me to use the drop in feature to connect to his echo and essentially have a video call with him at any time! (Of course I had gotten permission from the nursing home for this device and feature.) I did these ""drop ins"" by using the Amazon Alexa app on my iPhone. I also created a photo album of various pictures of my father and family that had been taken throughout his life using Amazon Photos, and was able to set the album as the home page on his echo, and the photos of the album would cycle through like a slide show on his echo. I figured this would give him some comfort during a time when family wasn't allowed to visit. My father has since passed away. I am just so thankful for this device which allowed me to ""see"" him during his final days. I now have his echo show sitting on my kitchen counter and I am also loving it, and constantly discovering more cool things you can do with it. (This is my first echo show.) Lastly, the photos of my father that I created in the photo album continue to cycle every day on the echo, and it is like a never ending memorial to my father.

"We have the echo show in our kitchen. I like watching mini news stories while cooking or cleaning, listening to music, and asking questions. The only downsides are that the speakers are only on the back so if you’re trying to watch/hear something looking at the screen, it’s actually louder on the other side. No big deal if you have the echo show on the counter up against a wall, but can get annoying because the people sitting at the kitchen table behind it hear it a lot louder than whoever is watching the screen. Somethings I’ll see a prompt to ask Alexa to play a news video or read a news article but then she looks something random up on bing video’s search engine. Sometimes she doesn’t understand what I’m saying (I swear it only happens to me and not my husband) which can be annoying especially because we have lightbulbs connected and that’s how we turn the lights on and off.Pros - great size for a kitchen counter/bar; great sound and video quality",4,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0

"I have an echo device in every room, and while the devices themselves are quite nice and well built, Alexa is pretty terrible. It's just not ready for prime time. Its comprehension of every day tasks seems so limited, that it's hard to get it to do what you want. Skills are barely usable, and are so cumbersome, that most of the time you can do what you need on an app on your phone faster than you can get Alexa to do what you want. Support for touch enabled skills for such large screen as the Echo Show 8 is virtually non-existent. It makes you wonder why they need a touchscreen. Things like volume and navigating media are the easiest things to control by voice, yet they have dedicated buttons, and touch controls, but not for much of anything else. It also seems pretty lazy not to scale the clock to fit the size of the larger screen. It's clear to me that we still have a LONG way to go to truly incorporate real smart voice recognition into our lives.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"We are dismayed with what we feel is rather misleading claims by Amazon. Or maybe it is GLARING omissions of features they decided to leave out of the Echo shows. We live in a modest apartment and have enjoyed having an Echo Dot in two of our bedrooms with our living room in the center of the apartment with our Echo Plus. What was great was the ability to pair all 3 Echo devices so we could play something and have it broadcast to all 3 devices. Amazon sells the Echo Shows as if they are EQUAL or near equal to the regular Echo speakers. HOW WRONG! There is ZERO ability to pair Echo Shows (at least not the Echo show 8) with each other. We bought two Echo Show 8s and are no longer able to pair our 3 rooms. We bought the shows for what the screens can do. And in just a couple of days, we have been impressed. The sound has been very good as well... AS SINGLE STAND ALONE units.Amazon, do something to fix your blasted units.

"Except, when compared to facetime (meaning mic pickups on an iphone or ipad) the sound quality of video (or voice) calls is far worse.  You would expect Echos - with there fancy mic setup - to offer better sound quality to the listener on the other end but it's like a bad 1980s speakerphone.One other thing - a nitpick, but - the art screen saver is one of the best, if not the best, that I've ever seen.  The scans are excellent and the variety of art is impressive.  HOWEVER - they don't tell you what each particular painting is (ok, reasonable choice not to clutter the screen) BUT Alexa also CAN'T TELL YOU what is on the screen even if you ask her.  This isn't a setting issue, the option isn't there.  So when my 5-year-old points to the Show and asks, ""who painted that"" I can not make it a teachable moment (or even, Amazon, a here's  good use of Alexa moment) I just have to shrug and say, ""I don't know, but it's beautiful.""",3,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

Volume is at 70-80% and is distorted.",1,1,2020-5-19,1,2,0
"There's so much that Echo can do now, and many things it can't - like integrate fully with Viber to make calls.  Skype integration needs more work to improve performance.  The $10 guide should be included in the box.  Who ships a product without instructions?  Amazon... that's who.  Not everything is electronic - particularly if you don't know what to look for online on how to get the full value out of this product.  The speakers and sound quality falls a little short of expectation, but it's a major improvement over the dot.  You shouldn't have to buy the echo show and a separate speaker system to get the full sound that should have been built in.  I'm not saying that it should sound like a Bose, but something better than a portable radio should be the standard.  The screen quality is very very good.That said, it's a great product if you can get it at the sale price ($79).  Don't pay full price.... wait for the periodic sales events to buy this device.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I am 73 and live in western NYS.  My daughter lives in Delaware. I bought Echo Show 8's for each of us.  I hoped we would be able to keep in contact especially during this pandemic.  We had 'Zoom'ed before, with other members of the family..but her picture was always blurry. Echo 8 to the rescue. It came quickly, set-up was quick and easy...but try as we might, we could not do video calls.  She contacted a tech at Amazon who was great, but after over an hour, could not help us out. The tech emailed my daughter a couple of days later as she had promised..but alas the ' honeymoon was over as far as my daughter and the Show..and she asked me if she could return it (it had been a gift). She did return hers.  I use mine by my sewing area to watch Prime videos. The picture is great. I do notice that the sound is perfect for music, but for videos, I could stand a little more volume.  I have since done a 'drop in' with a friend locally and it worked well.  Just missing my daughter.",4,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"I received this for Christmas from my spouse. We already had several other Echo devices in the home but I wanted one with a bigger screen and better sound. On those counts this delivers fully and then some. The stereo is outstanding. While I am pleased with most of the features, there are a few That either lag behind other Echo devices or simply are missing...First is the clock. I love the Spot and the clock is easy to read from across the room in the dark with the night setting.

"This is my third Echo Show 8. I really enjoy all of the features. My kitchen one gives recipe choices when asked for assistance, shows me news clips while I'm prepping meals, and helps announce when dinner is ready. The bedroom one greets me with a good morning fact, the day's weather forecast, joke of the day, and whatever songs I ask to hear. Ok, I know Alexa isn't a real person, but it's still fun to hear her tell me, ""Have a great day, Fay!"" Third Echo Show 8 allows instant communication with family members downstairs , instead of shouting from the head of the stairs! All three units quickly show pictures of who is at the front door with the link to the Ring doorbell, and provide a notification chime to alert us to Amazon deliveries and weather service bulletins.

"I have had many of the Amazon smart speakers with Alexa integration (Echo 1st gen, Echo Tap, Echo Dot 2nd gen, Echo 2nd gen, Echo Plus 2nd gen, Echo Dot 3rd gen) and this has been one of the better in terms of Alexa, voice recognition, and sound quality. We currently have it set up in the kitchen and use it for music, setting timers, and displaying recipes while cooking. We have it grouped with our Echo Plus 2nd gen that is located in the living room which allows us to speak to either and they work seamlessly. I have had one issue with voice recognition, all of a sudden the device wouldn't pick up any voice/command without any reason. I did unplug it and let it reboot and that fixed the issue. The sound quality, in my perspective, is just what I needed or would expect out of this item. It's a plus that you can adjust all of the sound settings (bass, treble, etc.) right on the device utilizing the touch screen or with voice command. The touch screen is a great addition and responds very well.Pros:",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,1

I often thought how nice it would be to find some simple recipes, but The one I had did not have video display.  I decided to try an upgrade to the Show 8.  I was not disappointed, actually I am very pleased.  The display is a nice size to be a companion on the kitchen counter, and occasionally rotates a news display or something of interest, so I follow up on what is being shown and learn some news about what is going on in the world.  The display on the Show 8 is a nice size that does not take up too much space especially with the stand - Get the stand!The audio quality is good, especially considering the size of this unit.

"Bought 2 of these on sale for our house. They work good and integrate with smart home features and alexa nicely. I already had the Echo Show (2nd Gen) 10.1” screen which I love. I do prefer the larger screen on my older model over this new 8, but they perform similarly.  Overall good and now I was able to add more units around the house.You may read a ton of reviews about advertisements, but they are not ads, they are alexa skills. Alexa skills are like apps that you can add to your device to offer more features. The ""advertisements"" as people are calling them are merely suggestions of skills to consider so you know there are more options out there. My older Gen 2 also has these, but they don't bother me. You can Google alexa skills if you want to learn more about those. They are not required, the echo show can answer tons of questions, give sports scores, add reminders and lists, etc. on it's own without adding skills.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
The clock function on this is terrible. It only shows up in a tiny font on the upper left corner of the screen and the temperature is even smaller.

So if you WANT video calling try to get Facebook Portal, it uses MESSAGER and WHATSAPP (which is SO SO widely used internationally and FREE). Skype sometimes wants to charge you for international calls ( I could be wrong)Other then that, if you're looking to use Spotify and Itunes Music it is ok.

She kept saying ""Its too big! I don't like it. "" I ended up getting her the 5-inch Alexa show which worked for her.That one is about the size of a phone. I ended up keeping this one for myself and I love it. 8"" may not sound that big but, it's a really good size screen.  Well enough to where I use it to watch videos while in the kitchen. The speaker is Awesome with a lot of bass and really loud. She's pretty efficient and I've enjoyed having it so much I'm considering getting a one for my office.

"I bought this because I love watching shows while I cook. Before I made this purchase, I was watching on my iPhone but it was a pain to stop a show to view a recipe. I have Hulu which is integrated with the Echo Show so I can just tell the Echo Show to play Hulu or whatever show I want and it comes on. I first had to sign into my Hulu account to set it up. I love the daily briefs,  I love playing tidal music on the echo. I have no issues. I set up my music app/registered it through my Alexa app so I just tell Alexa to play a song and it plays on the Show through my Tidal account. No need for Amazon music, I did have amazon music but cancelled it when I realized how easy it was to use Tidal.  My 10 year old also loves to watch shows while having breakfast or lunch. I love all the messages or hints Alexa displays while not using. Alexa gives me recipe ideas that look good, so I tell her to show me the recipe and I've actually tried them out for dinner. If I had an open concept kitchen maybe I wouldn't need the screen if a tv was near by, however I love that I don't have to touch the screen while cooking. I tell her to show me a recipe, the ingredients, the next step, etc...so happy with this purchase.",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0

You just can't do it.In all other respects the Echo Show 8 works fine.  We have several Echo devices, including the car echo, and this device integrates just fine into the system.

"The four-star is primarily for three reasons. 1:It’s pretty heavy. You’d think with technology that it wouldn’t be so heavy but not a big deal. 2:The plug is way bigger. I understand it needs to be 30 watts instead of the old 21 W but can we come up some technology so it doesn’t have to be the only plug in an outlet? 3: The most important point, I feel- Why doesn’t it come with the stand? For the price I think this is a minimal option that they should definitely include. I think that’s the only real issue with any of these is the angle and not being able to adjust it to see people. We primarily uses for communication to our family that spread out over the US. But even if we wanted to watch a show or something on it you really need to have an angle adjustment.

"I already have the echo spot in our bedroom which I bought to use as an alarm clock in an effort to get mine and my husband’s phones out of the room when we go to bed. It’s been wonderful for achieving that goal and for so many other things that we knew we wanted another Alexa device. I recently got the echo show for the kitchen to have hands free assistance while cooking as well as having recipes on the screen, videos of techniques too.  So far it’s been a great addition to our kitchen. We also love that it is fully integrated with the echo spot in the bedroom. One of my favorite features of the show is the broken glass detector. Having cats means that things get knocked over at all height levels and Alexa has alerted me twice so far about sounds that might be broken glass with a full recording of the sound each time. So cool. Thankfully nothing broke either time, but it’s helpful to know that sort of thing. She detects smoke also which is awesome. I’m a bit leery about going full out with the amazon home devices like lightbulbs and wall plugs, but they’re definitely tempting me with all these gadgets. Alexa is taking over the world and I’m sort of here for it. Haha!",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"I purposely bought this to use with my Wyze cameras to act like a baby monitor (but for my dogs).  Apparently with how Amazon controls the data coming/out, it cost more for Wyze to stream the video compared to other devices. The Echo Show will only show love video for 10 minutes or so. If I use the Wyze app on my phone, I can keep it on basically indefinitely.  From what I have read, too, only Amazon cloud cams can run continuously on Echo Shows.  I don’t know. I’m actually really disappointed. I may see if I can return it.",2,1,2020-1-15,1,1,0

I set up the show 5 first and found the software interface to be very friendly and lots of features that suited my needs. I especially liked the various clock selections. Went into settings and turned off all of the options for notifications which seemed to minimize the ""try alexa"" messages on the display. Went to set up the show 8 and was disappointed to find that the software is different than the show 5. Most noticeable is the lack of selections of clocks and backgrounds. I like both but wish the software in the echo 8 was the same as the echo 5. Both are linked to my Blink cameras, Gosund smart plugs and switches, Our Groceries app, and Vizio TV.

"So far it's been a mixed bag of expectations met & not met.  I only bought this, 2 of them, so that I could send one to my father at his assisted living in order to stay in touch... and give him some company (books read to him, music, look at photos, etc.).  I have not been able to test how this works since he was hospitalized shortly after I bought them.  However, in setting them up in my home, I've come across many user unfriendly features among other things.  The biggest unfriendly feature is figuring out where to manage everything.  Everything from contacts for phone calls to apps to music to books. Sometimes you do this, manage, on the device, sometimes through the smart phone app, sometimes on a website, sometimes through 3rd party... really really off putting to say the least.  For a device that is supposed to simplify or enhance your life, it is the opposite due to these management issues.  Even more maddening is all the commands that have to be learned verbatim.  This is not going to go well for my father, I can already tell.  I could print out a list of commands but then again, he's losing his sight.  Real life seems to take a backseat in a lot of how this device works, but I digress...So far having books read to me (still testing it until my father is out of the hospital) & looking at photos, are working.  However, if you make a mistake in signing up for Amazon music on the phone app, then you won't get family, and the device will not play different music on diff devices at the same time. And if you try to change it, it won't let you til the trial period is over.  That some people might die, literally, before that happens doesn't seem to have even been considered.  Just another example of user unfriendly features.",2,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0

I would like the ability to answer incoming phone calls on it but the voice calling out feature is excellent and allows a large number of contacts.

Even my husband, who has been against getting a Prime membership for years and who is anti-technology, loves it!! So far, I am enjoying our first steps into having a ""smart"" home!!",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,1
"I bought this to show my Ring doorbell life view automatically when motion / ring is detected. Impossible to do that. Both products are from Amazon, but not working together as they should.You always need to say ""Alexa, show front door"" or whatever. 0 points. Mission NOT accomplished. I have about a dozen Echos and 9 Rings and the simplest thing is not possible to integrate... Sad Amazon...",1,1,2020-1-6,1,2,0
"I use this to communicate with my elderly father.  Drop In works well when it works, but sometimes audio justs stops working on one side or the other.  It is like a microphone is muted,  but it isn't.  You can do a Call or talk with alexa and it works 100% of the time so you know it isn't muted, but using Drop In will not have audio on one side of the conversation and you can't get the audio restored unless you reset the unit and set it up again, (per Amazon technical support).  We had the same problem with an Echo Show 5 and hoped this unit would not have the problem, but it does.  Read the forums.  Many others have this issue with Drop In.  If that is not a feature you need then everything else seems to work great.  Good sound quality if you want to listen to music.",3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"Use it in my kitchen and I love it! I was nervous with everyone complaining on certain features that can’t be turned off like the suggestions, but I love them and you only see them shortly after interacting with Alexa. I had no idea Alexa could do so many things so her suggestions are very helpful in that matter too (plus there’s an app too for customizing shortcuts and commands). Usually I see landscape pictures and after awhile, the screen just goes black with a white numerical clock displayed after a few hours of no interaction. She can hear me in the living room (open concept) with no issues and even down the hall if I’m loud enough. We have it hooked up to our Ring device and response time is really quick. Best device I have bought from the Alexa enabled line",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"I LOVE my Echo Show 8! I received it along with a year's subscription to The Food Network Kitchen and it is an absolutely amazing combination for people who love to cook. Not only that but the sound is great, it makes a beautiful digital frame for your photos and I personally like all of the suggestions that you can program to pop up. Recipes, your local weather, news headlines of all kinds, etc. I find out all kinds of interesting things lol.I didn't buy the 5 because frankly, I wanted to make sure I would be able to see it without any issue at a slight distance and it's perfect for my kitchen. I did not buy a stand and don't see me needing one.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"We have three Alexa’s in our house. Dot, echo 5 and echo 8. This one is the best for sure. Nice big screen and great speakers. Still need to connect to my ring for our door and flood light. I know people get annoyed over the ads/news. Whatever. Doesn’t bother me one bit. I like it because it gives all kinds of info. I also have my photos linked up so they display them throughout the day. The sleep mode is nice if you want the screen off. I even convinced my mom to trade in an old Alexa for this one. She has the OG echo from 2.5 years ago. The connectivity is quick. We also have smart lights connected. It’s great to have multiple. My son has the echo 5 and smart light in his room. So I’m able to turn off his light and turn on music without having to leave my room. I fought have this for so long. But honestly, I love having Alexa.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I use this Alexa Echo on my home-office desk, and it is a handy assistant.  I can just ask Alexa little things that I might ordinarily look up.  It saves me the time and distraction of opening a new window on my computer.  Alexa plays WQXR for me during the day and always posts something like an album cover or some kind of illustration that informs me of each musical selection that is being played.  I can ask Alexa to calculate numbers or define words or whatever.  I can ask Alexa to remind me of deadlines or important to-dos or set a timer for certain things.  The video component will allow me to see news clips or explanatory YouTube vidoes through Firefox.  I can ask for suggestions for Dinner tonight and she will offer a few recipes, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and then save the recipe where I can pull it up later for reference while cooking.  (Of course, this requires taking the Alexa Echo to my kitchen.)  Oh, and I love the classic art selection that scrolls across the screen.  It is significant to point out that the Alexa screen is not dark when not in use - it scrolls a selection of pictures in accordance with the subject matter you choose, along with news headlines and little suggestions of trivial things you can do with Alexa.  I am sure there are other neat tricks that I have not discovered yet, but it is fun to try things as I think of them to see what Alexa can do, and it is very nice to have the video option.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"Bought this to become my new alarm clock.  Little did I know that the clock face options do not exist on the 8 like they do on the 5.

Now they rotate through on the screen, and I go “ahhh, I loved that moment!.”  Grandkids, vacations, everyday life, scenery, our pets, etc. (that led to me discovering that now I can get prints made by Amazon....just had an enlargement sent straight to “great-grandma” easy peasy).I also love the lyrics that scroll along with the music so we can join in and actually get the words right!  Also the weather and sports scores show up intermittently.  All this in addition to Alexa.  Plus, a couple of the kids plan to get these, so we will be able to video chat with them.  This was a worthwhile purchase for me!",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

To add insult to injury, spent over two hours with Amazon customer service trying to get resolved.

"Got two, one for the kitchen and one for the master bedroom, as an early anniversary gift for my husband. At first I was worried we wouldn't get much use out of them and it might be a bit of a frivilous buy. BUT, we have both loved having this in our home! It has simplified a lot of little day to day things. Alexa doesn't ALWAYS understand what we're asking, and sometimes it might be because it's beyond her capability to answer, but I feel like she responds correctly about 90% of the time. I have also loved using them for music, the ""play music everywhere"" function is fabulous and easily fills our home with clear sound. Just enough bass to make it good, but not annoying or tinny. To people interested, I would recommend looking at the list of skills Amazon has made for the device, it's a great way to see what you can do with it. It showed us how much more it could do than we thought.",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"It does everything the Echo Dot does but I was hoping it would access more apps from my fire stick. It would be nice if it could access my recast TV and then we could watch pre-recorded shows and television in our kitchen where it’s located. They made it sound like it could access all the apps and everything I read.As it turns out it was only access prime Hulu and photos plus for some reason NBC. Hopefully in the future they will be doing upgrades to this.

"I'm loving my new Alexa Show 8.  I've had 3 Alexa products (Echo, Dot and Spot) and this is by far the best.  The sound quality is incredible for such a small device.  The screen clarity is very good and the size is just right to view videos without being too small.  All I had to do was plug the device in and it was ready to go. My husband was also a fan and he doesn't really pay much attention to any of my new devices. He loves how he is able to see the lyrics to his favorite songs on the screen. I don't mind seeing the messages of ""things to try"" and it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I actually ""tried"" a few suggestions. I'm thinking of gifting one to my son so I can chat with my granddaughter and get the extra benefit of having a large screen.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"I am sure that I have not even tapped the surface of all that can be done with the Echo Show 8, but I love many qualities about it.  I love the quality of the music- much better than the dot quality.  Also, while playing music, it displays the words... just like karaoke. ;)  I can download my own pictures into the app and have them displayed...although I haven't tried that yet.  It is currently randomly showing beautiful nature pictures.  I like the ability to notify family members in other rooms (that also have some google device) that dinner is ready or other messages. I will probably obtain the Echo 5 or 8 for our bedroom to use as an alarm. I also love being able to chat with family members, long distance with the large screen.  It was a great gift!",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"For the price, it's a good value. The sound is considerably better than the new Echo Dots, but still a little short from the level of the regular Echos. The screen quality is fine for what it is and the setup was dead simple. However, for me this device failed to do one thing I really, really wanted it to do... play lyrics. Sure, an Echo Show 8 will totally play lyrics... just not if you're playing to a group with Sonos speakers in it. I incorrectly assumed I would be able to have an Echo and Sonos speakers play together so I could get the lyrics on the screen... nope. If you're a pure Echo home, this is a non-issue. The new Echo Studio sounds amazing, but that didn't exist years ago and I'm pretty heavily invested in the Sonos world now.

"Overall a good device. However, the reason I downrated it is that ""wallpaper"" photos don't  show up correctly, they show up on the middle and then burred on the side, sort of as 3 photos, but the one in the middle good, but the two sides burred.  .  We decided not to use photos.  Our Echo 1 is  alot better for pictures. I even talked with an Amazon Representative and he seemed to think it was a design defect.  Very disappointing, but I like the device anyone for other reasons.  We just use the canned wallpaper.Also, supposedly got a ""trade in"", but no box or information on sending it back was included.  What is even more disturbing is the ""Amazon card"" and the ""trade in"" were charged to my Credit Card account.

"First, I am a big fan of the echo and echo show products. I have many of them and have been quite satisfied overall.The echo show 8 is essentially a smaller echo show, not a larger echo show 5. I was really looking for the ability to only show a clock at night, like the echo show 5, but the echo show 8 doesn’t have or allow that ability. It’s too bad, I was hoping this would serve as a larger “clock” for our bedroom. Instead it’s an echo show with ‘things to try’ steaming across the bottom of the screen all the time.",3,1,2019-12-8,1,2,0
"Great Echo device (one of my favorites) with a bigger screen than the Echo Show 5.

I am really enjoying my Echo 8. The Echo 8 controls everything that I have in my household. I was really shocked that I can view my nest thermostat and cameras. I have a google nest home and the echo 8 works better with my harmony hub and my Genie connect skills. Alexa lets me control both of my Harmony hubs where the Google hub only allows me to control one. The google hub beats the Echo 8 for watching YouTube videos. I wish Amazon and Google would just get along because their disagreement hurts the consumers. I have my Echo in my bedroom because my alarm clock quit working so I have not tried to look up recipes. I enjoy seeing the weather and my favorite sports teams scores scroll across the screen. The Echo 8 is well worth the money.,5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"The Echo 8 looks good, sounds good and probably performs well on most functions.  Granted, I haven't tried out all the features yet so I may update this later.  The two items that knocked the two stars off were the SiriusXM and Amazon Music song displays.While the Echo plays SiriusXM fine, it fails to display artist or song information.  One of the main reasons I bought this device was for that feature.  I even found in the customer Q&A an answer that it would do this.  Every item in my house that has a display shows song and artist, so I'm doubting it's all that difficult to do.  Please add this in any future software updates.",3,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0

I am glad I got this thing I believe other than my TV I didn't go wrong by getting this.  I suggest you put it in a area that everyone can enjoy it. My only biggest suggestion I could offer Amazon is to offer the new owners of Echo Show a paper with the most often used and 5 star most users Alexa skills list that are great on Echo Show.  I believe we could be missing out on some good ones that work well with Echo Show.

It integrated with my other Alexa devices without issue and to date has been so much fun. My Grandgirls have played all sort of games and watch several program from Amazon Prime, they enjoy it very much. I'm still learning all that Alexa can do and help me with. I ask if she could clean my house. She said she would but didn't have arm, so to compensate, she offered to play 'Cleaning' music.

Our first foray into Echo Shows and this Show 8 didn't disappoint.  Will be gradually upgrading our echo dot 3 to Show 8's as sales come up.  Didn't jump on Show 5 as it was too small of screen and didn't want to shell out big bucks for Show so the Show 8 is a great value especially with current free Dot 3 promo.Only minor issue is no youtube app so have to go through browser.  Hope Amazon can include routine capability for browsers so I can use voice control to launch pinned url so it's no hands required.,5,1,2019-12-22,1,1,0
I had the echo show 5 and decided to upgrade. Overall I do like the 8”. Bigger screen is great. Improved speaker is a plus. The problem I have is it doesn’t hear me call “Alexa” and I have to yell louder.  Also the clock display need more customization like the 5”.  You can’t even put the date on there.  Only time and weather.  That bites bad.  Hope they do software update and fix this. As long as they fix these issues it will be a solid device better than 5”. But until then. My 5” is a better performer.,4,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0
"There’s some kinks in it that are present with all Echo devices, mainly relating to Amazon Music. That being said the sound is great, i use it by itself or i have an echo dot plugged into my stereo i can accompany it with, i really love the setup. If you want a show for the speaker get the 8. If you just want the functionality i recommend the 5. I got my parents both 5s and they’re actually more customizable and faster loading than my 8. When i use my dads and then mine the 8 feels pretty sluggish, which is only an issue if you’re watching videos or navigating menus, things i don’t do often. The big display is nice, but you’re severely limited on face options. I want to say the 5 has at least 20-25, this one has closer to 5; several picture themes, an option for a single photo, or an option to shuffle an album. After seeing all the faces on the 5 i was very excited for the customizability on this but it just isn’t there.

I have to say, if I had known how ANNOYING this machine is, I would not have bought it.

Stop making it so difficult for people to remove your advertising. We already purchased the item, stop using it to try to sell your stuff, its not right.

"Have used this for few months now. Not sure if the item was returned or was new due to packaging. It wasn’t registered to anyone so I assume new. It is very glitchy - voice recognition makes mistakes routinely. We have to repeat many times. Once it takes you to what it thinks you said - you have to exit and repeat what you really want. That’s very annoying too. We like to play games on the device but also annoying when it asks every time if you want to sign up for a subscription on basically every game. We have the google comparable version - voice recognition, games, search is much better. They should Save the response from before and not ask again. It is bulky. Shaped like an old cathode ray tube tv. I guess much of it is the speaker/mic. Nice features being able to use as an intercom with other Alexa devices, play music. Connecting devices is ok with the app. Again google was easier and better. Switched to Alexa as we kept getting echo dots thrown in with purchases. I guess they caught us. The ask Alexa notices on the main screen - don’t bother so much. If you switch to do not disturb - it stops the notifications but then you can’t fully use the device.

After some online searching I found that this seems to be a common complaint.

I cannot figure out how to get it so that two people with shows can see each other ON THE SHOW.

Our son in law got everyone in our family an Echo. We live in different households in different towns so it’s great for connecting with family.  Our favorite feature is the photo album feature. The screen continuously goes through our Facebook photo posts or our Amazon photo library.  It’s great a moment around the house when an old photo pops up. We also like some of the basic features like the lists we can create by talking to Alexa and the local temperatures.  The speakers are good quality so my husband listens to his favorite music on the Alexa even though we have built in speakers in our home.  There are still some features we haven’t familiarized ourselves with but with what we experienced so far it’s great.  The only drawback is the screen is tilted so we have stand in front of the kitchen counter where it’s located.

"My mother lives in England, I live in America and I used to see her once a week as I fly for a living.  I purchased one of these for her last year as she's elderly with macular degeneration and she's loved it.  She's used it for listening to her audible books, the radio and sometimes just having a chat with Alexa.I got mine this week.  It sets up in seconds.  Plug it in, sign in and you're good to go.  I immediately started a video call with my mum and she was thrilled.  I'm now getting my whole family to buy them so we can stay in contact and feel more connected.  The picture is great, the size is perfect and I couldn't be happier with it.",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
Has good sound.  I like display setting and size of clock.  I like news info the scrolls across so I’m case I want to hear about new info I can. It won’t do this if you are viewing your camera or calendar or on a call.  You can go to settings and home content and just uncheck what you don’t want to see.  You do have to pair your iPhone and go to Apple.com and get a temporary password to link your iCloud calendar but it worked.  I did have to change the name of two camera.  Alexa did not understand the word Wyze.  I had to add app for photos but got it done.  It is quicker to open a camera on echo show then grabbing your phone and opening and app and scrolling to correct camera if you need to see who is outside in middle of night.  One reason why I got it.  Nice display size,5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,1
"I bought this to compliment my Blink XT2 and I've read so many posts that it does not connect correctly, or only has audio feed but no video feed. Here's a few tips to get it to work properly. 1.) Make sure you have a strong wifi connection with proper bandwidth. 2.) Set your video quality resolution on the XT2's app to ""Saver"". There is a small noticeable difference in resolution/definition but if you want to show live video, this feature must be set to Saver mode for it to work. Until Blink or Echo Show updates it to accept high res. This is the only work around. The speaker is phenomenal, full amd rich that's comparable to the Echo itself. Go with the 8 rather than 5... better speakers and bigger screen. Hope this helps!",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Received this item for Christmas at a price of 68.99.  Enjoyed it but noticed that the calendar would not update.  Called tech support (45 mins on phone with them) tried everything they said did not change.  eventually sent it back, just wanted a replacement but amazon just wanted to refund my money and I could reorder.  when i went to reorder the price had increased to 99.99, after many times talking to amazon they finally agreed to refund the difference but would only put it on an amazon credit for my next order, making me spend my money with amazon.  when i went to place my next order the credit was not there.  I called them again and all was worked out, but it should not have been that difficult for me to get this done.  My new Show works great and we enjoy using it.",4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
Currently the show is sitting on my desk as a glorified digital picture frame.  I think those that would get the most use from it are families that want to connect via video and all have alexa.  I suspect it makes for a nice world intercom.  Sadly other features are just too unfriendly and i would prefer to access them via other means or too limited to be attractive.  I think the show is probably a couple years away from being a really good investment for most people.The device is attractive and what it does is pretty reliable.  With amazon behind the product this could easily swing the other way quickly and there are still probably a fair number of people who would find value here.,3,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"I really like the show 8, however all the pictures I've uploaded via the Amazon photo app have blurred borders. I'm very disappointed with the lack of support for this problem. Update: After going around and around with Amazon Tech. Support with this issue I've been left with that it's all basically ""user error"". In other words somehow the way I took my photos was why the show could not ""show"" an unblurred photo. However, if I upload an individual photo from the devise the photo was taken to the show it displays perfectly. But if I upload multiple photos from the same device the pictures were taken from  to the show via the Amazon photo app the photos are blurred on the borders and sides. In conclusion I can only deduce that it's the Amazon app is the problem and not the users device the pics were originated from.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,1
"I received the Show as a gift after already owning an Echo 2nd Gen.  I moved the 2nd Gen into the bedroom and put the Show in the kitchen.  The Show starts playing my ""Good Morning"" routine, but stops when it gets to the news feed.  It also won't respond to ""tell me a joke"" and some other simple commands like that.  The 2nd Gen still works fine (plays the full routines, etc.).  I contacted the Echo hotline at Amazon and they were unable to help.  Said everything looks okay from their end?????  There must be some type of conflict between the Show and the 2nd Gen, but nobody at Amazon seems to know what it is.  Frustrating, because otherwise, the Show is great for recipes, etc.",1,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"I love this device.  However I think Amazon is missing the mark on certain push notifications.  I really wanted my echo to say "" Hey you got an email ""  or "" excuse me but the earthquake monitor just recorded a 6.6 earthquake""  or "" freeze warning tonight""  or other announcements without having to ask alexa.  Also there should be better camera support for the show line.  Not very many ipcameras work with it, however those same cameras work well on the fire stick.  Doesnt make much sense.  I guess they want more sales with companies they support like ring.  But overall I am happy with all the home automation integration and such.  It's still a great device with many cool things to play with.",4,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"We live out beyond the suburbs in the rural hinterland with marginal internet connectivity. So we have chatted it up with the grandkids with Echo dots, thinking there was inadequate bandwidth for video. But Santa brought the Echo Show, so we gave it a go. Way to go! Literally, plug and play (no plug and pray required).  Very nice display with updated settings interfaces for personal configuration so all those negative reviews (mostly User Not as Smart as Smart Device (UNASSD)) appear to have been listened to and responded with this hardware / software release.Nice sound quality both for video chats and streaming audio. Nice shutter control to block the camera lens if paranoid or conspiracy theorist. Nice long (48"" maybe) power cable for flexibility in placement.  Camera appears to be positioned for counter top placement. We started on top of the microwave but the video chat only got the ceiling fan. Cleared a few inches of counter space and the camera angle covers us well.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"I upgraded to be able to see the weather/time at a glance and not need to ask alexa.  Partly because of the disruption of having that out loud, and partly because the audio recognition isn't always a forgone conclusion.  The audio is significantly better than the echo dot, with a much better bass.  The apps and services open quickly.  I do video from a 3rd party integration with alexa and that functions well. Only a couple or so seconds lag to start.  its nice being able to see the command responses to home automation on the screen.  Let's you know it heard you and it heard the correct device you are trying to control.  Audio recognition does not seem to be any better than the dot.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0

I have this next to my bed and paired it with my other accounts (music, cable, etc.). I like the morning sunrise glow so much! I use to listen to music, make lists and more. I use it to control my smart lights and talk to other devices I now own (dots and echo plus). I can make announcements (like Dinner's ready) or use it as a 2 way radio without having to physically go up the stairs. And, I can use it as a Karaoke machine! For the money, you can't beat it.

"Decent smart screen has some unnecessary issues holding it back. Like some people mentioned it lacks a lot of granular control, you cant get rid of the useless 'Try Alexa...' stuff, you can't control any aspects of the volume individually subwoofer volume tends to be too loud relative to other sound and Alexa voice can be obnoxiously loud compared to other media, one thing that did annoy me was the news headlines are always truncated so unless you say 'alexa what's the ____ story' its just like an annoying hook.  I like it for being able to view my cameras but the feed isn't great and there's no way to control the camera position at least for my cameras.  I got it on sale so I feel like it's good for that price at least but I probably wouldn't get another or one of the 5s until they had some updates.",3,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

My wife who is not technical quickly started to adapt is service around the house we have 10.  The security issues is of minimal concerns as we do not discuss any sensitive information that can be exploited in its range of listening> Also, there is no other way Amazon or any personal assistance vendor can improve the Alexa responses to your inquiry unless a human finds out what it could not answer.  Alexa will ask from time did it answer your question and that is why.  The same as in the 1968 Move 2001 a Space odyssey.  The way the response is improved remains the same.

I am satisfied with the show.  For my screen saver I personalized it with Amazon photos.  Everyone who comes into the kitchen wants t linger if not for the music for the photos.

I like that you can turn the camera off for privacy.  We have an Echo in the living room for music, firetv for the tvs in the living room and a firestick in bedroom.  This is a great product but like a mini tv.  The only space that I could possibly use it is the kitchen where I wouldn't because I don't want it to get ruined.

Can't play YoutubeTV and its processor is obviously way under performance required for good web browsing. The small echo I got free located away from the kitchen in a den was able to pick up my voice I was yelling so loud....  I ran into a host of other little issues that seemed like bugs.

As several have said the screen constantly suggests new uses for Alexa.  This doesn't bother me as I don't intend to watch the screen when I am not using the unit.  My only con for the Echo Show is that it must be plugged in to use.  No USB or other charging.  Absent that, no complaints and highly recommended.

Naturally the Echo Show 8 does everything the other echos does, but it has the advantage of having a screen to see some features you couldn’t see on the other’s such as news videos when listening to your Flash briefings. You also have access t Tubi  (no account required) which is good if you done mine watching long programs on a 8” screen and others channels such as Hulu, NBC, Prime video, and kitchen all of which requires account linking.I also like that you can download pictures from your phone or Amazon cloud account and add them as background photos show.",4,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

The buffering and lag is terrible. I'm not sure if it's on Wyze's end or the Alexa skill end. I can access the camera on the same network with the Wyze app with practically zero buffering or lag time. Just a warning If you want to buy this for Wyze cam monitoring... don't. Buy a tablet instead. It's also worth noting you can only stream 10 minutes before having to reconnect to the camera. This is a Wyze cost saving feature and would be fine if you could reconnect without 2 minutes of buffering again. The 3 stars is given based on it's performance as a wyze cam monitor.

Two elements of important context as to why this is helpful for me is 1) I am one of the many people who have been turned into 100% work from home employees when i used to be 33% work from home, and very much miss the dynamic of interaction and getting out of the house.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,1
It's a great product. Just would be nice if you can activate echoes voice when touching the screen. That is the only annoying thing to me. You are able to stop most advertisements. The only one that does not turn off is the one before the screen turns off. It only stays on for less then a minutw than goes away. The screen adjusts according to the lighting environment. Its a descent size. Not too big and not to small. I have one in every room of the house. I leave the camera shutter slide closed on all of them so the hackers aren't able to see me. I like the product. Hopefully they can make an update to activate Alexa's voice when having touched the screen to activate it. The speakers sound good for the size of the item.

I enjoy the recipes that you can pull up instantly.  The ability to add ingredients from the recipe to your shopping list is helpful too.  I’ve been setting up my slide show with all my photos from Amazon photos. I love video calls with my family too.  My only wish was that I could have afforded to purchase the larger sized one.

I use it for kitchen timers, my kid watches her shows on it when she sits at the kitchen island, and I even ask it to show me my driveway camera view if someone is coming over. I think the most use it gets is when I ask it to play my kids favorite songs from Amazon music! Our family is a music family and we love being able to tell it to play our favorite songs on demand!

What I don't like about this is that you cannot talk at the same time. If Mom and I say something at the same time the audio gets cut off and it's extremely frustrating for her. Pretty irritating to me as well. She ends up giving me a disgusted look and I realize she would rather just talk on the phone. As far as the other features, this touts an awesome recipe integration but it doesn't work with Google and that's where I find the best recipes.

"It's goofy you have to install an app on your phone to set-up and control an Echo, since it's already an Internet connected device. If you have personal security concerns, this device is NOT for you. While you CAN add contacts without allowing the Alexa app on your phone to have access to your phone's contact list, you are still adding an app without knowing exactly what info it is gathering and forwarding. My Echo was a gift to me, but honestly, the video phone feature, which is nice, could just as easily be satisfied by Skype, on a more portable platform like a laptop. If you want this device, and personal security, buy it, install the Alexa app on your phone, enter your contacts, then uninstall the app. You CANNOT add a contact directly via the Echo device, since contacts apparently are not stored locally - so be aware you are giving that info to Amazon to ""manage' for you. Also understand you are giving Amazon permissin to retain everything you do via the Echo, including recording your audio.After mucking with settings I was able to eliminate (turn off) the constant (and very annoying) scrolling through displays of trending topics, weather reports etc. I'd find that distracting and annoying if it was constantly in my field of vision. What you CAN'T turn-off is the never-ending scrolling of prompts at the bottom of the screen demanding you ""Try 'Alexa, do something or other'. Either cover it with a piece of tape, or turn the device so it's face-down.",2,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"overall a great addition. still working out the ability to broadcast thru other echo devices. VERY annoying ongoing issue with spotify (and other streaming services as I found out). stops playing songs after  a few songs, turns out this is caused by another not speaker device being included in the selection. My husband has big fingers and when adding the dots, accidently got a firestick on the everywhere group. once the firestick was removed, it works fairly well. I will stop after a time and you have to tell alexa to resume. Although I can't be sure, it seems to be at the end of the playlist. Took some searching on the forums to find out what might be causing the problems, definitely fixable though. Wish Amazon would get  rid of the constant message of ""try this"" TOTALLY NOT INTERESTED!",4,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
Excellent integration with the Nest Skill. Primary reason that I bought the Echo Show. Have 5 Nest cameras around the house and it’s nice to be able to ask to show each one instead of whipping out the phone to view them when I get motion alerts. There’s a bit of lag but that’s expected since you have to link the accounts and there’s some latency. One thing to note is a simple rescan of devices in the Alexa app will not detect a newly added camera. For that you have to disable the skill then reenable it to relink the account and detect the new camera. You’d figure a simple rescan should find the new camera but not that simple. The Echo Show compliments other Echo Dots and Echo around the house. The screen quality while watching videos and Prime movies is really crisp. Great little gadget.,5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"I bought this mainly for a set of blink cameras both the XT2 and the Blink mini, and both sets have different issues with this device but all work great with there free mobile app..first the XT2's this device will only connect to them randomly like half the time you try to view them Alexa will show a preview then say ""i dont know what went wrong"" and close again all the cameras work great with there mobile app so is defiantly the Echo that has a problem, as far as the new mini, the Echo will always say the camera is not responding even tho you are viewing it(that one usually works but reports that it does not lol) otherwise nice device for other things just dont buy it for Blink cameras until they have fixed this issue and from what im seeing its been an issue for a couple years now.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"After reading many reviews on Echo Show 8 i purchased one for my grand kids and one for myself. I thought my 4 year old grandchild would be able to call me himself, without parental help., but it didn't turn out that way .The SHOW  doesn't understand his voice, or he talks to fast, or not clear enough or doesn't say the Exact correct words to make the call . I wish Amazon would enable an easier way for young children to use this device, very dissapointing as he still needs parental help to call me :(.",3,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"I bought the Amazon Echo Show for my parents as a holiday gift and they absolutely love it. They use it in their kitchen for timers, listening to music, hearing the weather, I even showed them how to add their doctor appointments to the calendar. I connected their mobile photos with the Amazon photo app, now they can see a slideshow of photos of the grandkids, which otherwise would have been stuck in their phone. It's a great present for someone you love or even for yourself. I Highly recommend this product.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,1,0

The camera is Doo doo. The audio is ok definitely expected more. All in all I wound up giving it to my sister as a gift as I still sit here and pay on it.

"I bought a Show to replace my original Echo device and I have found the experience to be lacking. There's no point in getting a show as the visual and UI elements are not well thought out, buggy, and lack functionality.It's amazing that you cannot ask Alexa to show you pictures of something; nor can you ask to show videos. If you want to do that, you have to load a browser on the show and enter a search using the keyboard. And, simply asking to open the ""browser"" doesn't work. You have to remember which browser you installed - Silk or Firefox.",2,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

Now when I say ""Play music on all speakers"" nothing comes out of the new Echo Show 8 (you know the one with the really good speakers) and the music will only go to the previous two dots I had connected originally.

Every room in my house has a echo and remote switches, locks, cameras etc.  this was just a disappointment.  Paying 25 for a stand was a bit much too, it should come with one considering this is for the kitchen counter mostly.  The cooking channel is willfully light on cooking shows.

The screen is good, it picks up conversations if you answer the phone nearby so clearly it hears well.  it's default screen is helpful too and it does wake up calls!I am testing it to see if it will be helpful for my 93 year old dad so it can handle tasks like ""Go to Amazon Prime Video"" or "" Go to Spectrum TV app"" and ease the burden of tech know how for dad.

We’re changing security platforms and the new one does not include a touch panel which we have become used to using. It sits in our living room. The speaker is pretty good definitely better than the initial echo and echo dots which we have in other rooms of the house. I like to listen to music on it often. It also works really well to Skype. Something I didn’t think I would use it frequently for. It’s nice for my son to be able to Skype with my parents without having to give him one of our phones.

"How much would a smear/smudge resistant glass cost: another dollar?  The smudges are instant and precipitant.  If you use the Show 8 regularly, you will need to clean it two or three times a day.  If you happen to use a lotion, count on even more frequent cleaning.  The auto dim feature is a love-hate relationship.  It's good to dim the screen at midnight, in the dark but when it happens at 3:00 PM in a dim room, it is very annoying.  On the other hand, the speakers are excellent for this type of devise.  The screen resolution is adequate for viewing almost anything.  It's not HDR, 4K but it is a very watchable view.

Not specific to this device but i noticed it after I got it I pay 14.99 a month for Amazon music yet more than half of what I was requesting Alexa was pulling from Spotify (If thats the case why wouldnt I just pay for spotify its cheaper).

And when I tried to use it with Amazon photos, it froze, then crashed and I had to factory reset. The only video calling it works with that I've figured out is skype,  can't get it to synch right with my phone contacts or video call them.

"This is my 10th Alexa capable speaker device and my 4th Echo Show device.  With each iteration, for the most part, the Echo Show line continues to refine and improve upon its predecessors.  Actually the Echo Spot took a backward step since it can't (won't) run Hulu - how weird is that (inserting gratuitous complaint on this issue here).  All crickets at Amazon on Hulu as to why since it was playing Hulu a few versions prior.Back to the 8.  Its great.  Sound quality is super.  Still a bit of directional responsiveness with the microphone resulting in Alexa not understanding a command on occasion resulting in her assuming she heard an entirely different command thereby pursuing to act upon it causing stress, anxiety and general panic from her commander.  I'll confess to not having spent to much time adjusting microphone sensitivity and experimenting with other optimization methods.  Bottomline is 99% of the time she understands what has been requested.  On occasion, given certain ambient noise conditions such as a fan running and given the relative angle when speaking to the device, Alexa can get a bit confused.

"This Show 8 has the same size viewing screen as the original Show I had in my kitchen (that just died after a couple years).  I like it a lot!  The screen resolution is much improved and the sound is great.  It IS much lower to the counter than the old one because the old one had the screen above a speaker.  I decided to move this one to my master bathroom and get the new generation Show 10 for the kitchen.  Since I know it will sit lower on the counter and it needs to be seen over a lazy susan, I purchased a stand to raise it higher.  I am quite happy with this addition to my Alexa-enabled home.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

"Love this. So much more useful than timers. I can turn different lights on/off and even schedule them. I can also control them with my voice or through the app in my phone.  I bought my parents these with Echos for Christmas. Because these make lights handsfree, they're perfect for elderly that need their hands for walker stability. They also love being able to use their voices to turn on/off their lights at night. I bought Echo shows to check on my parents too. I can sleep while listening to make sure they're ok after coming home from the hospital. Paired with the Ring doorbell, they can talk and see the nurses and caregivers.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I've had issues with regards to sound since opening this product. The sound will not play.

"I just got this ECHO SHOW 8 and couldn't wait to hook it up and so far works perfect and I am loving it. Watching movies and listening to music and getting most of my cooking information is OUTSTANDING!!. Settings was a breeze to setup.

The sound is nice loud and very clear when I walk into my living room testing it out from it being in my kitchen on the counter top, But I plan on putting this in my bedroom on my night stand. I already have Echo Dot in my computer work room, But wanted something this time with a screen and being I am a amazon prime user I get to watch my listed and other movies on here. Loving This!!",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
i like watching movies when im in the kitchen cleaning or cooking but amazon prime sucks out of the country. for my opinion if im on a device registered to amazon with my account then let me watch what ever i can in or out of the country. i understand if its not an actual amazon device. but the amazon devices created by amazon should have an exception. an andriod device is more flexible as you can get more movie providers.the screen is a nice size for a crowded kitchen counter.,4,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"I use my Show 8 in my home office almost every day for so many things - weather, news, calendar, reminders, timers and so many other things.  I also purchased one for my daughter who is away at college and we video chat several times every week. When playing music, the sound is pretty decent, but I've hooked up stand-alone speakers which makes it better. Also have one in the bedroom we use for alarms, announcing the temperature and weather forecast for the day and headline news to start the morning. When one of us is in the bedroom and the other in the office on the other side of the house, we use Alexa to talk.  If you are worried about privacy, you can block the camera and mute the microphone. Highly recommend any of the Alexa Show models.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
Bought an Echo Show 5 earlier in the year. Was using in the kitchen and I liked it. Wanted one for the bedroom. When the new 8 was introduced I decided to order that for the kitchen and move the 5 to the bedroom. Loving the 8. Nice screen display which I have displaying a slide show of my photo galleries. Sound is much richer than the 5. Subtle differences vs the 5. The 8 is more refined and seems to offer more display options. Works well with my Wyze camera system. I currently have 6 Wyze cameras inside and outside of our home. Can view any of them upon voice request. Nice feature. Very happy with the purchase.,5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

"As a family that has an Echo in every room, fire tv on all LCDs, and generally love Amazon the Show is the worst device we have bought at Amazon.  The voice recognition is horrible and not as intuitive as the simpler Echo devices.  You have to repeat things many times and a lot of the time the voice goes unrecognized.  We never had this happen with other Amazon devices.  The price was the enticer and a screen to watch recipes/movies while cooking.  Unfortunately, the price was the only good thing about the purchase.  I had such high hopes for this device.  Maybe it will get better over time.",2,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0

"We received Amazon Echo 8 as a gift. It was easy to set up. Alexa doesn't know everything and it's somewhat disappointing that she doesn't understand some things I'd consider obvious. One of the best features for our family is no more paper shopping list! Simply tell Alexa whenever I think of something, and the list is updated on the Echo and my phone; a simple tap as the item is purchased removes it from the list. The Alexa app is like an extension of Echo. It makes the lists available on both our phones. Be cautious of some of the apps, or skills, used by Alexa because they're not all free and you don't know in advance. I'll get a pop-up in the app and am still uncertain how to opt out. I still have some security concerns but overall we are having fun with our new Echo and can't wait to try all the features.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

And I ask it to...  it is almost commical at a point it becomes maddening. but I will not let her get me down. I just realize the limitation and move on. Clarity of Voice and image are great.  It took a little while for me to get her hooked up to my ring device and associated items but, stick with it and you will get there. Hope you enjoy yours...  Only bad thing is it must be plugged in to work, as it has no battery or other help to keep it working in a power out or taking it from room to room.  it also has a nice alarm that is more plesant to wake up to than a standard alarm clock.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0

A lot less bezel (they moved the speaker from the front to the top) and much better sounding.  When I have all the devices playing whole-home music, the difference between this device and the older ones is unmistakable.  I think I'd like to trade my Gen 1 show devices for this one.

I thought the Echo Dot was included but looking back Amazon wants to make sure you're paying attention and press a button to get one.

The sound is great too. I don’t think it’s that great but I don’t really get into technology. It plays music and stuff on voice command. It can control your lights or automate your house. I think that’s kind of stupid and lazy. It’s cool to just pick a song or something but it just seems to me to be a gimmick that doesn’t do much. It’s worth buying on Black Friday or cyber Monday.

I can also play Prime video shows, play music and see what the latest weather is.

It works sometimes well and most of the time below average.  3 inches away I am screaming at it to stop or start etc. Times I ask it to do one thing and it decides it will do something else.  About 5 out of 10 times it will answer a question correctly. If it just came out my score would be higher but after all this time it seems to not be on Amazon radar for improvements. I have reported the issue to Amazon, had them on the phone to listen to what it was doing. I do have Amazon's competitor as well in the same home.  While it won't get a 10/10 either it scores a lot higher and more consistently than the Amazon product. The first version of these was much better; as they came out with models afterward they became more unreliable. I have checked with friends and they have the same issues.

I really wanted to like these things.  We bought 5 for the office to communicate and also integrate with ring.  When you make a call between devices the sound does not work on one or both devices.  Unplugging and plugging in does seem to work to reset the device but it just ends up happening again.  It does not end up being a reliable communication device.  Happened once with the ring doorbell as well.  Video appears but someone can't hear the other person and sometimes both ways.  Amazon tech support (remember this is made by Amazon) their only advice was a factory default reset.  I was hoping tech support would say - this is a known issue and here update the software and it will be fixed.  It is clearly a software issue that will hopefully get fixed at some point but enough people will need to complain before that happens.  After spending 90 minutes with tech support and no remedy (and no offer of any kind of compensation on these brand new devices) I suspect most will just grin and bear it and unplug their device and just deal with this poor functionality.  The tech guy acted like I was nuts when I called and a simple internet search shows people all over the place are having this issue.  Amazon always seems flashy and has some cool tech but I feel like it is consistently a disappointment.  Alright rant over - don't buy if you want to try to use this for calls or integrate with ring - it is not consistent.,1,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

It works well to stay in contact with our two grandchildren that live in Virginia. As we used to see them only twice a year, this is quite nice. We are slowly finding other ways to use Alexa as time goes on; the list seems to be endless! We would recommend this unit especially if you have family or friends out of town.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"This Show has very nice scenery for nature. Last night I found out that when I turned my light out, the show became very dark. Great because I didn’t have to go back make that happen. I just received this and have to get used to it. Already I have learned that I need to find a way to get some kind of speakers. If you are listening to music with deep bass it has to be lower. I don’t think it can do well With the speakers it has. But for the size And price it is good. The product is great. I will learn more as I go. I look forward to doing that. The 8th show is groovy. I like it!",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"I already have several Echo devices (Echo Plus, Tap, several Dots), and have generally enjoyed all of them with the exception of the Echo Plus, which sounds great when it works, but constantly seems to factory reset itself.If you have owned any of the echo products in the past, you pretty much know what youre getting here. Its Alexa with a screen.",4,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"Enjoying the larger screen, better sound, and streamlined appearance compared to the original Echo Show. I'm still amazed sometimes by what she thinks she hears and how she responds, compared to what I've actually said to kick off my saved routine. ""lights out, please"" translates to playing several different songs, apparently :-) when Alexa heard ""play top please"".",5,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0
"The Netflix app is a free download, yet it is not available on the echo show. In fact, a lot isn't available. There's a reason that a TV can play all networks, as opposed to having an ABC TV and an NBC TV, etc. I bought this to replace a TV with a fire stick to save desk space. Now I have a smaller screen with fewer capabilities. I usually check that a product does what I want before buying, but considering that my phone, smart TV, laptop, desktop, and fire stick all have Netflix capability, it seemed pretty reasonable to assume this would as well.On a positive note, it's very good at the things that it can do. I just wish there were more.",3,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
I’ll admit. Coming from an original echo show it is a much nicer device. The slim bezel compared to my old one gives me more screen and less speaker grate to look at. I don’t use it for anything other than music and a digital picture frame in the kitchen.  My only gripe with all echo devices is the lack of ability for it to optimize a search engine to answer more questions. I tend to stump Alexa a lot with general questions when she really has the whole internet at her fingertips to find answers. Other than that it makes a nice addition to my current echo family of speakers.,5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"This is my first Echo product with Alexa and I love it.  I purchased one before it was the Amazon Dot and didn't like it after two days so sent it back.  I thought I would give this another shot since it had a screen like a TV and you could see everything.  Hooked it up and it started working right out of the box.  Nothing much to do except follow the prompts.  Just remember you have to have the Alexa app on your phone for everything to work smoothly.  It does everything just by the sound of your voice.  Grocery lists, turn the lights off and on as long as you have the plug.  If I can set it up anyone can.  I am a tech dummy.",5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"We have three Echo Dots in the house and now the Show. We also have Dish Network with the Hopper. We have the Dish Network skill enabled in our system, the three dots can control our Hopper but the Show can't. Our show is in the kitchen and we have one dot in the living room. Even though we are much closer to the dot and it's directly in front of us the Show will override commands given. If I ask Alexa to ""pause Dish"" the Show will reply with ""sorry I can't find a device named dish""  It's highly annoying, wished I could turn down the mic gain on the show. We like the Show but don't understand why it can't do the same basic things the dots can.",3,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"As many people, I was nervous about buying a unit like this for the house that would constantly be able to hear what you are saying. But at the same time, we all carry a device everyday that tracks and listens to are every conversation (cell phone) so I decided to buy one. Let me say, I love my Alexa units (now have 4 total). I can wake up and Alexa gives me the forecast and plays video of the previous day sports highlights. You can sync your Spotify to play in specific rooms or create ""Groups"" so you can play music in every room in the house if you'd like. Also ended up buying one for my Mom and she loves it as well. She also loves baking and she has Alexa pull up her recipes each time!",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"This is the first time I've had anything with a screen.  I love the beautiful photos it displays and all the ideas that it comes up with for things to ask.  I'm still in the learning process, but the more I discover, the more I like this.  My initial goal was to be able to play music throughout my house (thus the additional speaker) because I read a lot and like to have music playing in the background.  I really like the idea that Alexia is just a voice command away.  I still have a TON of things to learn about this item, but find myself enjoying it more and more each day.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"Not very impressed with the show. I originally bought it for a motion sensor for the kitchen but unlike Google home, it doesn't work like that. Then I thought I could add my recipes but that's a joke. I tried to download the skill all recipes but it won't even search. In the end, all it's turning out to be is a picture slideshow. Still debating if this thing is even worth it.",2,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0

"The echo 8 is not as good as I hoped it would be. I would think it would be the same as the smaller version but they seem much better. This one often gets requests wrong, if I ask a question it will repeat the answer twice or simply not know what I am saying.  The biggest reason I bought it was for a bigger clock but that is not available for some reason. I “think” they finally made the clock a little bigger but it is still not full screen size and I have no interest in making it a picture show or anything. I’m keeping it, but had I known about the clock ahead of time I would not have ordered it anyway.",3,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
I love the size of the 8 inch echo show. Its great for recipes or by my exercise bike to watch hulu. I like it much better than the echo show  5 which I also have. Integrating most products is fairly  easy but they do seem to drop out sometimes for no apparent reason. Voice recognition is pretty good. I seem to talk to Alexa a lot more than I talk to humans now....... My only gripe is navigating on the echo show would be much better if it was easier to navigate by touchscreen as well as talk screen. Sometimes I can't get Alexa to understand me and I would love to be able to just navigate to what I want. For instance - Alexa did not want to go to hulu. It kept giving me wikipedia and not the app. It would have been great to have a button to press.,4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"These are new devices for me. I’m not completely ignorant of technology matters; this was a gift, and I continue to be surprised at how little operating information comes with new technology. Echo Show 8 is a good example. If it came with a user manuaor something more than a very small fold-out piece of paper, I could probably figure out how to utilize the product. As it is I have to depend on my daughter and granddaughter for help in setting it up and operating. Frankly, I doubt I’ll ever see a great need in the Echo Show 8, but it’s here and I’ll use it some.",4,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"I love the build quality, size and content especially built for the Echo Show display. However, I'm not impressed with Alexa's ability to hear my commands and how she has trouble understanding important phrases like ""Stop"" or ""Quit"" or ""Back"" in certain circumstances (usually when multiple processes are running, like a video or music and a couple timers, etc.) I'm not sure if that is a hardware, software or microphone issue, but it detracts from the ""smart device"" experience. I have to repeat these key phrases over and over to get results. Most of the time Alexa knows what I want to do and helps me get it done. But there have been times when I'm ready to send her packing.",4,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0

The sound is good, but I'm using Bluetooth on my Bose speaker, another nice feature.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I've yet to connect it to all my cameras but I'll be doing shortly, the one thing I dislike most or I've been most disappointed about is that it's not responding to my request as specifically as I ask mostly first thing in the morning when waking up it's not recognizing my voice to stop the alarm or disconnect/stop Sleep Sounds and Relaxation.But all in all I really like it but probably not as much as my 12yr old son who seems to be having a blast with it/Alixa asking her to rap (hecka funny) but loaded with lots of info",4,1,2020-3-21,1,1,0
"The microphones pick up speech pretty well even from very far away. (not sure if it's all that great , due to privacy concerns) .

"It was a gift. Hard to find where one needs to set up things....on Echo Show or on Phone app. The sound from it is way too Bass, and comes out of the backside....away from all ears! I miss seeing Green circling ring when a package has arrived like on the Echo Dot. (We have a long ways to go to get package from dirt driveway. Was nice to know “it” was delivered, to get it out of weather.) and she seems slow to respond to questions.I did have fun setting it up to turn on a Rooster Lamp, and have it, Echo Show, crow like a rooster 3 times...in the morning.",3,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"It is a good device. I would add ultra hd audio and an optical output to it. I would pay a lot more for that or for a big screened version like that. Also, if another device like an echo link is the speaker for this and playing amazon music, it should still show the album art and lyrics. I would also set it up like that with the speaker off in the everywhere group. I get around this by leaving the show volume on by turned down way low and it works well like that. This thing is still cool as a display for ultra hd music on my stereo and whole house audio systems.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"The main advantage for this device is that it doesn't have  a battery, so if you leave it plugged in all the time, which you have to do, you don't have to worry about overcharging the battery like you do in a tablet.  The voice commands can be handy, but they can also be epic failures.  I have audio books by different authors with the same name. I cannot get Alexa to retrieve the title I want. Every time you disconnect blue tooth headphones, Alexa announces it to the world through her speaker. It kind of defeats the purpose if it it was to keep things quiet.",3,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"My only quirk with Echo-8 is that Alexa’s voice seems muddled. I didn’t have as much trouble understanding her with my Tap.It may be the size of the speaker or how it’s placed in the Echo 8. I haven’t figured that out yet. I have the unit next to my bed on a night stand, I don’t have a stand for the unit, that may make her voice more understandable.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0

But my issue is been being quirky so i used to be able to say ""alexa hulu alexa open live""  and my echo would do that but now it list whats live on tv so then i will say ""alexa number 2 "" where as before it would select the number 2 option now it start talking about 2 as a number and what it all means 😥. So if I say select #2 then it will select it. I also had to unplug it when it stopped responding to me. It was funny my other echos heard me down the hall in a different bedroom but not the one right next me kind of scary after only 2 weeks. Ive just been noticing little glitches here and there and it wasnt there at first and its scaring me a little.",4,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"Really nice - Integrated with echo Dot by placing the Dot Elsewhere (muted the Mic on the Dot - not required but in a private area for us).  Can play music ""Everywhere"" and both echoes play the stream so as we wander throughout the house we hear the music. When many songs get played the lyrics show (like Karaoke). We have our Prime photos display on the home screen (cycles through several hundred) - Weather shows super nicely visually.

At other times...well, it's Barry White and Al Jarreau that provides the inspiration >>wink, wink<<.

Sounds fine. I thought I might be able to use it as a small tv on the counter, but it doesn’t fit the bill. I get the feeling that Amazon is not doing any work adding value to Alexa. Just keep pumping out devices and using crowd sourcing to manage the Alexa ecosystem. I wonder if their engineers even use these, or live in households with more than one person. The Alexa app is dated and clugey. I’ve been using Alexa since it’s debut, and get frustrated that it’s just not a priority within Amazon.",3,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0

I liked it so much I ordered another Echo Show 8 yesterday for the bedroom.  It is much better than a clock radio.

It does so much more - check it out and look at the reviews.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
This is my first Echo and as a long time Amazon fan I don’t know why I waited so long to get one. I like the suggestions she displays. I like the current event news items. Through the app on my phone I added about 50 skills for her to do. I like watching Amazon videos while cooking dinner or listening to my SiriusXM radio (would love if it would tell me the artist and song!) I can listen to My Daily Bread while I wait for my coffee.

"The sound is good, the touchscreen is very nice to have, and I really enjoy watching a slideshow of my photos. There are many more good things versus bad things but there are 2 bad things that prevent me from giving it 4 or 5 stars. The most annoying of the 2 bad things is the constant message on the screen that says ""Try this ........"", if there is a way to remove this, I haven't found it and it's absurd that it never goes away. The 2nd bad thing is that it needs a built in stand. I know that Amazon wants to make more $ by selling a stand separately but without a built in stand, the price that Amazon wants for the Echo 8 isn't as great of a value as you would expect from Amazon. Without a stand of some type, the camera is useless unless you have something on your ceiling that you want the camera to see.  I created my own stand because I'm not giving Amazon more $ for something they should include.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"Let me start out by saying what is good. The video was really good. It had no problem playing prime video, hulu or youtube. I didn’t view NBC. The sound was really good too. The alexa suggestions didn’t bother me because you don’t have to look at them and they didn’t play during the videos. Yes, it would be nice to be able to make the time the size you wanted, but again, it didn’t bother me. What I found astounding was it would not play my audible books, iheart radio, and at times amazon music. I purchased the original one with the audible & other issues, it was replaced very fast. Unfortunately the replacement had the same issue. I spent countless hours chatting with technical support, even had the issue escalated to audible escalation team. But they couldn’t fix the issue because audible wasn’t the issue. I did find out if I paired the echo show 8 with another device and asked that it play audible, iheart radio or amazon music as a group, then the echo show 8 had no problem playing them all every time. But it had to be in a group, the other device had to be online & when you asked it to play you had to specify the group. I kept the echo show 8 about 2 weeks hoping someone at amazon could figure out & fix the issue. Alas, that hope did not come about & I ended up requesting a return.",2,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"We bought this Echo 8 primarily because my wife's siblings were all buying it and she wanted to keep in easy touch. It works well, was easy to integrate with Alexa, and the video is very good. The only downer is the sound. Voices sound tinny, as if there was feedback going on. You also have to deal with the lag between the two parties since you both can't speak at the same time (true of most streaming chats).  The design of the Echo 8 almost requires that you buy a stand for it, which we did. We're generally satisfied, but still hoping the sound quality might improve.",4,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0

If I just ask for a command like I do with the dots, it will not work.I am keeping it, but I also hope they can upgrade the software to put the date on the screen.

Our dot had excellent sound quality but we find the Echo 8 is not quite as good. We are still tweaking the 8 and hopefully will find a setting that satisfies us. Integration to our ring devices and wink devices was quick and easy. Voice recognition is very good but there is always improvements that can be made. All in all we are very happy with the 8 and its additional functionality.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I love my Echo Show 8! It looks great and has really good sound quality. I have been very impressed, and love trying the new things they recommend. It's wonderful to cook with, watch videos on, video chat with family, etc. No issues at all with getting it hooked up and connected to wi-fi, etc. I was concerned I would end up wanting the bigger one, but the Echo 8 is the perfect size for me.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,1,0
"My first impression is poor.  Able to disable some of the unneeded stuff but still have the ""Try, "" this or that nonsense which apparently can't be disabled.  Very little control over what appears on home page such as the clock and weather.  Need to have bigger clock and ability to have 5 day forecast.  Speakers are fair with fair amount of base but are directional firing backwards/  Original design with 360 deg speakers bit better.  Other in use setting up haven't seen much use to display, I WANT MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT IT DISPLAYS BY DEFAULT.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"Ok seriously, this thing is amazing. First of all Alexa is by far the superior digital assistant. I’ve tried bixby, cortana, Siri and now Alexa. I even doubled back to all of them to be sure it wasn’t just recency bias. No way, Alexa is the best. Not perfect, if they care amazon can ask me what I would want to see improved. So, the speaker is amazing. I mean from all four sides. Even the front is amazing without over blasting Loud to back behind it  it exists in large open main living area and kitchen and dining. So the speaker is super good. I’ve played it at max loud and it’s just unnecessary unless your compensating for a bad recording. The super quiet is pretty good too. This is my first Alexa device, but on vacation we stayed at a place that had the tall echos on each floor. And we had loads of fun. The kids kept trying to stump Alexa. So the tech got a good workout. And I got a sense of limits.  The screen is a whole new ballgame though. Often, visualizing a thing helps me remember doing or saying it. Also gives me confirmation that it is done. I can watch things. The integration is so cool.  The other smart items it syncs with doesn’t just let you send commands but almost everything I tried I can interact from the Show’s screen. Dim or brighten lights on other floors is one I enjoy. But there are an astounding number of apps and devices that it interacts with and by voice at that.  So I love this thing and I love very few things. The only drawback is that it has no life when you unplug it. So it’s an inconvenience to move. But it’s the only drawback and I’m willing to accept that it is what it is until batteries are on the next level. Thanks",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"I would say this is the best echo. It’s screen is just right. Not too small (echo show 5) and not too big (echo show).

"I received a Google home nest mini and wanted to add a smart screen to my lineup. I purchased two smart bulbs and a smart outlet to have some home automation. I decided I wanted to look into getting a smart screen/speaker and did a lot of research before my purchase. I like how a lot of devices work with Alexa. From my research I found that Google assistant has fewer choices for smart device compatibility but still a fair amount.I decided to purchase the echo show 8 while it was on sale. I figured if I didn't like it, I wasn't out the full amount. I opened the box, set it up and had it going in about 10 minutes. It seemed to work well and recognize my voice decently when there is zero other sounds in the room. If a tv is on or music is playing, even at a low volume, it has trouble understanding what I ask around 30% of the time. It can be very frustrating. The Google nest mini understands me way more often under the same conditions (roughly 90% of the time). I know the nest mini is a smart speaker but I would expect the same from a speaker as I would a screen. All in all I will most likely be sticking with Google products over Amazons products.",3,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I am so happy we decided to get the Echo Show 8.  We have a few ring cameras and you can easily pull up the live footage.  We got it mainly to be able to watch the dogs and kids on the camera while outside so we can get chores done around the house.  We can hear them and they can hear us.  It does so much more than that though... Would be great for a Karaoke party, as while playing songs it shows the words.  It gives you tips and ideas that you can use it for.  If you are considering this purchase I would say DO IT!  I wish I would have done it sooner.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
Alright Amazon...I’m pretty impressed. I was on the fence about this purchase. Didn’t think we needed another device but man was I wrong. My toddler knows how to use it to watch his favorite shows. And I’ve connected it to a few of our cameras in the house including my sons room. I can pop in on him by way of this product. What I wish it has was more touch features and voice where I could talk through my cameras. I also would like a video that shows me all it can do. One more thing...the sound is 👌🏾  Much louder than the echo dot,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"On the Echo Show 8, impossible to remove these stupid things to try tutorials.  Turned off discover, turned off all notifications and a non-stop barrage of “Try this, try that” always flashing on my screen distracting me while I’m trying to work.  DND temporarily turns them off, but also prevents the device from receiving notifications or calls... making it a useless paperweight.  For now, I’ve fixed it with a strip of black electrical tape.  Maybe someday Amazon will listen to their customer feedback and take some sort of action to correct... maybe",2,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"I bought this for my kitchen to be able to see a recipe. Instead of constantly having to open up my screen on my phone to see a recipe while in the midst of making it, I can now use my voice. Yes, I can adjust my phone screen time but then I have to remember to reset it back. As this is a security measure,  I love the Echo Show because it's so convenient and much a more secure way to cook as it never leaves the house and doesn't have all the info stored in my phone.And the music sounds incredible too!",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"We already had a couple of echo dots in the house, and love them.  We use them to make shopping lists, report the weather, reminders, timers, and smart home controls.  We find the voice recognition to be superb- much better than other voice enabled devices.  The echo show adds another layer of sophistication- a screen.  So when I’m cooking, I can view the recipe, and not worry about using my messy hands to scroll through the recipe- I just ask Alexa to scroll down or up, or move to the next step in the recipe.  The screen also works well with lists- if I add an item to my shopping list, it automatically pulls up the list, showing the new item as well as the existing items.  Asking for weather also pulls up a visual.  Originally the echo was around $300.  I recently got a deal that gave me an echo show and an echo dot for around $80.  At this price point, you can’t go wrong!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"I liked this product initially. I bought it in February. Three times it started playing music out of nowhere. I don't have it synced with my Alexa upstairs. I called Amazon three weeks ago about it. They are still trying to figure it out. Then, yesterday (3-6) the music I had requested wasn't audible. Alexa could hear me and respond, but the music was muted. The lyrics appeared as songs played, but you couldn't hear anything.  Now, both stop playing part way through a set. I'll request, for example, play techno. It will play a couple songs then stop.  Previously it played for hours.  I hope they will be able to fix them both.",3,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

The recipe feature is nice, but frustrating when I found the perfect recipe on my iPhone and can't figure out how to transfer quickly to the Show.  Sound is great for the way I use it. Voice control is not perfect, but it is quite useable. Nothing I couldn't do just if I pulled my phone out and then balanced it somewhere, but way more convenient.

I had a Google device but didn’t use it very much. I got the Show 8 in a package with a Ring doorbell and a Dot. Also took advantage of the Plug offer for new users that is essentially free. I use this system regularly and are considering adding more security cameras and a thermostat. There are so many features with Skills that I have just scratched the surface of what it can do.  The only negative so far is that the music quality from the speaker is not great. I’d rather use my JBL Flip 4. Besides that I’m very pleased with the Show 8.,4,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"Overall, very satisfied with the Show and all its features with one exception, the audio. Alexa’s communication is somewhat unclear (too much base, muddy) although not nearly as bad as the echo dot 3 yet not as clear as the echo dot 2. There is a way to adjust sound for music play but apparently this does not apply to Alexa so understanding her requires concentration and repetition. It seems to me that this can easily be corrected by having the equalizer settings apply to her as well (this should also be done for the dot 3 which I no longer use due to the very poor muddled Alexa audio).",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Overall I am happy with the features and functions of the Echo Show 8.  I have it set to the correct time zone and city and yet there are major discrepancies between what my echo dot and echo show report as ""current temperatures"".

It chimes letting them know you’re connecting and then you’re able to speak to them. I like it so much that I bought 3 of them to put in different rooms of the house.

I do feel like the sound quality when playing music isn’t quite as good as our Alexa, but that could be because of the speaker location. It doesn’t seem to project as much.

"This was a gift from family so we could share family photos. Echo was easy to set up and linked quickly to my Amazon account. Photos were easy to upload and categorize into albums. Image quality is very good. Alexa is quite smart and you can ask her a variety of questions. So far we have used Echo to display photos, play music and seek answers to questions. You get a lot for the price. We have only just started to learn what Echo can do.The only thing we discovered is you cannot create a Family Photo Vault and share your photos between family members that live in other countries.

They're perfect for randomly adding things to your shopping list or checking the weather... or if you want to hear a terrible joke.  We have no complaints whatsoever.

"In my opinion the Echo should never be 5 stars since the whole concept is to constantly learn and improve upon Alexa’s abilities. The hardware (Echo Show 8) is great, a little heavy & sometimes ‘glitchy’ (nothing unplugging and plugging back in won’t fix). I think the Show should come with a stand as a standard vs an additional cost/expense (sitting directly on the counter makes it more prone to spilled liquid etc).  Alexa always gets smarter and there are more skills it seems daily. I do feel a little confused on how to expand the system by adding an Echo Dot, Smart Home functions and the integration of all these items.  For example building groups/rooms etc was confusing and how to play music everywhere... the same station or different stations and can the Echo Show control all of that? I find myself physically turning my Echo Dot off in the other room because I don’t fully understand how to get my Show to make those adjustments.  I know it is possible but a high level blueprint or matrix would be helpful. Otherwise I love Alexa and I am excited to continue watching how this technology grows and how it is changing the way go about our lives. Great stuff!!",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"We ordered the Alexa Show on the recommendation of a friend. It was a pain to set up— ended up having to get on the phone with support to get it functioning properly.

I’ve used the recipes feature a few times, but I really with there was a way to save my favorite recipes to it somehow— adding the link to it in the Alexa app or something. The feature is a bit useless most the time since I can’t pull up my tried and true online recipe favorites.The video calling feature will be nice to finally use  once we get my boyfriends parents an Alexa Show (they don’t have iPhones so FaceTiming/video calling is a challenge and usually low quality— the show should be a better experience but I can’t speak to it yet.)",3,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0

It has only stopped working once.  I found that removing the power and applying power again solved the problem.  It's a computer so it makes sense that once in awhile you have to reboot.

The negatives are (a) it is not easy to set up; (b) I can't find a way to take the date, temperature, and time off the screen when my photos are ""playing""; and (c) unlike the Echo Dot, it does not tell me when I have notifications. If I ask about notifications, however, it will tell me what they are. Perhaps I don't have the settings correct, but as I said, it is not easy to set up the device.

I’m learning things. Last I would like to give kudos to the sound quality on the Show 8 it’s pretty awesome for such a small device.

My rating would be all 5s but I’m having account confusion so when I call the account says it’s my wife instead of me - and we have different accounts.

I'll be speaking directly to one Echo, it'll light like it hears me and then not respond, and off in the distance I'll very faintly hear this one talking. It's pretty annoying. I have ESP enabled and it still does this.The other thing is that Amazon keeps showing a list of things to try at the bottom, even though I turned that off in settings. Amazon, I've had your products for years, I know how they work! Please stop telling me useless things.",3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
Pros:Excellent Build Quality,2,1,2020-4-27,1,2,0
We keep our Echo Show in the kitchen. We do so because she actually helps us with recipes and with cooking itself. We set timers for everything. We maintain our shopping list on Alexa. We listen to music and have questions answered. We are almost dependent on her. Our real story is that we had one and over time we started to hear a bit of static at times. So we had to purchase a new one. We didn't have the heart to let our first one go so we moved it to the bedroom and now we can talk to each other using the Echo. Love this product and all it can add to your life!,5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Honestly, beyond disappointed in this. We purchased and Echo Show 5 and loved it. So much so that we figured we would move the Show 5 from the living to our bedroom and just get a Show 8 for the living room. Because of course you would have EXACTLY the same functionality built into the device that is larger/better. But alas, no. No way to make the clock large, you can't even choose the same wallpapers as you can on the Show 5. We were really impressed by the sound, but for everything else you lose, this wasn't worth it. We will be returning this for a Show 5.Echo team,  if you would like to discuss this more. I would be happy to provide some further direct feedback. Thanks for making the Show 5 so awesome though!",2,1,2020-4-9,1,1,0
"I love all the “skills” you can use on this device! The show will even suggest (in text) “skills” you can try. It is has enabled me and my family (who also have Shows and also live in different states) to easily stay in touch through video, voice and text messages. It’s like having your own private social media network. Also, I really love how the Show 8 ( not sure about other models) has an actual physical shutter to shut off the camera. I use my Show 8 daily, I use voice command to tune to my favorite local talk radio station , set timers and reminders, check the weather and check out current news events and I’m learning new stuff the Show 8 can do all the time.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"My first Echo show does not disappoint! I bought this before Christmas when they offered special pricing and paired the deal with a free third generation echo dot.I think this device is more responsive to my voice than my original dot, and commands are promptly and accurately delivered. I love to use this for cooking new recipes, viewing lyrics to songs I love and listening to my favorite authors and music.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Show is a great device. It has a lot of features and can do a lot. Favorite is shopping list. No more forgotten items. Tell it and check the app on your phone at store. Down side is there are lots of commands to learn - exactly. No real instructions. I thought it would open to Facebook but not really. (They have their own device.) Texts show up on screen. Had some trouble with setting up video calls. One great trick - my mother forgot to hang up phone, I got busy signal for hours. I sent message to Show that said ""Hang up phone."" She did and then called me. Overall - great.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"We have a 10.1 inch echo show, an Echo show 5, and an Echo show 7.  I gave the Echo show 7 to my parents in Florida, and they love it.  My son will be going to college in 2 weeks and he wanted an Echo show, so we bought this 8 inch one for ourselves and will give him the 10 inch one.  My wife was concerned that the bass on the music wouldn't be as good as the 10.1. Much to her surprise, the music, including the bass, is  awesome.  We know the quality and functionality of Echo shows.  The Echo show 5 is on my desk in my home office..",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"The Echo Show is my favorite IOT device. We have three first gens, two second gens, a five (don’t care for the 5 at all) and now the eight...love it! The second gen has been my favorite as the display and sound are the best. It’s great for a large open space. We have it in our kitchen. For most spaces the eight will be perfect. Great sound and display. Amazon hit the sweet spot with value and features on this device!",5,1,2019-12-1,1,1,1
"Overall, a nice device to integrate into our home setup (more than 2-dozen smart devices, in an IoT integrated home).We've had the first generation of Show devices since they came out and I was excited to see the upgrades. Hands down, the sound quality is greatly improved! Nice improvements to the deeper bass sounds, although I could argue to almost to the point that the highs drop out.",4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"We've had the Echo Show 8 for about a month now and used it to replace a 3rd Gen Echo Dot.  I must say that as far as voice recognition and sound quality, the echo dot was much better.  The Show 8 just can't seem to hear at the same range.  Sometimes I can be just a few feet away and it won't hear me, but the dot which is now 25ft away will.The screen is decent, except it is always putting stuff on the screen that i don't want.  I don't want it telling me what to try and the bottom all the time. I also don't need to see the score of last nights game all day long.  Maybe give me an option to acknowledge that I've see the score by tapping on it.",3,1,2020-1-24,1,1,0
"I purchased the Echo Show 8 for my mother to use as a video calling device. My mother does not  have a cellphone which seems to be required for setup and to make video calls, this is not stated in the device requirements. Setting this device up remotely from another state is impossible. The Echo Show 8 is not suitable to send to seniors to use as video calling devices during these Covid-19 times for these reasons. Do not buy until a better method of setting up and administering has been created and tested by Amazon.",1,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"I like the visual aspect, being able to see time and temperature at a glance, and things such as lists and calendar when asked. I've disabled many categories of the constant distracting and annoying stream of suggestions. This Show seems to have considerably more trouble with speech recognition than my Dots, Echos and Echo Auto, at least when it comes to requests re. lights off and on and such. Because of placement location, I don’t use the touch screen capability at all...and probably wouldn’t anyway since this strikes me as being counter to my reason—voice activation—for having Echos. Too, whisper mode is whimsical...you never know whether your interaction will be loud or soft.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"The Show was a Christmas gift.  My son set things up.  However, it uploaded ALL of my photos from my camera.  Do I want a picture of my car battery on the Show?  No.  How about medically sensitive photos, which I have a lot of.  I can't even run the slide show for fear of what will be shown.  I deleted the Amazon photos app from my iPhone, but apparently it's too late, all those unwanted pictures are there, somewhere.  I need MORE CONTROL over this device.  It should only display photos I want displayed, not act as a vacuum to all my photos.  I'm not sure what to do next.",3,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I love the new Echo Show 8!  It's small but packs a powerful punch.  The sound quality has improved dramatically!  It has much more features than the first version.  I love that it's smaller but has much more interface.  I use it for my smart home technology...turn on lights, cameras, etc.  I also use it to answer my Ring doorbell as well.  I'm sure my knowledge of what else it offers is lacking, but to that note, it does everything I need it for and much more.  I would definately recommend getting the Echo Show 8!",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"At first didn't like it. Didn't think I needed it.. but it's grown on me music sound ids awsome for desk top speaker got some good thumping base it's not portable I mean no battery always need the ac outlet. And it's great for traffic and weather conditions don't  have to look on my phone just teach it your commute and your home location after that just ask Alexa while you get ready for work its pretty cool. It also tells me if amazon is going to make a drop off today,  and when the p as package has been deliverd.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"wow! i got this for my wife but we all love it. i can check the video doorbell, and even make regular phone calls on it. sound quality is amazimg, picture is clear, ease of use and set up is a breeze.the only thing i would change is the little ""try saying..."" things that stay on bottom of screen on home page",5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
I got this for the bigger screen.  I love it as much as I have my Echo spot.  I have so much integrated into Alexa that these little gadgets are a big part of my life.  We use it to control all the lights.  No more searching for lightswitches or trying to handle those with full hands.The Show has a big enough screen that when trying to find a recipe I can read it on the screen.  Big enough to enjoy making calls with.  Have been watching videos on it and enjoying those.  Important part of our home now.,5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"We enjoy the games and storytime. It will play movies and videos from available sources and the sound quality it great. The picture quality is really good as well. I really enjoy how everything I want to look up is so easy to access. Shopping or recipe searching, it's all super easy with clear pictures and great information display.The only thing that bothers me is the issue we have with all our Dots, it will activate and start spouting information when it is triggered by a similar word to it's wake word.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I love all the Echo products. I started with the little disc ones and now have progressed to the Echo 8 with one in each room  I like that when you use the Ambiant noise, the fabulous choices come on the screen for selection with Amazon Prime. Good sound for everyday radio talk, and very convenient to be in any room and be able to ask time, weather, recipes, talk radio, music streaming or meditation mode. There is an off camera button to slide on top as well as a sleep mode that will sense when the room goes dark and dim down for sleep. Alexa still has a lot to learn, over all this is a great price for all she does.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"Bought a couple of these to upgrade a couple dots I had in different rooms. The 8"" size is perfect for bedrooms, kitchen. The built in speakers are nice and clear. The device works as it should. Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and we use these constantly. The display and speakers are almost the same as the larger 10"" Show which is another feature that is amazing for the price. The camera shutter is a nice add on. I like the idea of flipping the shutter and not worrying who is watching. Setup is simple, the device comes registered to your account. Put in your amazon password and you are all set. I didn't even need to put in my WiFi password. I'm guessing that is because I have other Echo devices on my network. Overall great product.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"It's got a great screen. It's got great audio. It looks so much better than the old Show. But honestly, this one picks up the wake word ""Echo"" maybe 50% of the time, leading me to yell at it and generally not believe that it'll hear me. In comparison to the 1st Gen Show, which worked 99% of the time, this is super disappointing and leads me and my family to shout at it constantly. Couldn't recommend it in comparison to the other wonderful devices that make up the rest of the Echo family.",2,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0
"As a standalone product, this device is an excellent audio player and even a surprisingly adequate video player despite the sub-10"" size. Where it really shines, however, is as a major player, or even the central hub, of a whole house connected ecosystem. Augment it with a network of Echo Flex devices (and their various attachments) throughout the house, and with other connected devices such as the Blink Mini (Amazon's indoor camera) and a desktop with the Echo Show 8 on it becomes a command center for your entire living space.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"When the sound is in low volune, Alexa can't hear me.  Hard time set up door bell camera.  Customer service can't help, the person has no idea.  Too bad, Amazon page said comparable, but has no idea how to help customer set up, and the the final answer was the other end camera software skill not comparable.  Very funny, huh???",3,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
"I like the way that it is built and seems to be sturdy. I like the way it will listen to orders and respond. I don't like the fact that it is slow to respond. For example, if I ask Alexa to show me the front door. She will respond with okay and then I have to wait a couple of minutes before she will show the front door. By then whoever was there is gone.She will also start playing music if she is left alone for a period of time. I hate that. I know she is listening to me all the time and trying to learn.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"I was doubtful this was more than just a luxury and we'd probably never get one, especially since my wife was initially very creeped out by the reported 'snooping' of these machines. Anyway, we got her mom one for Christmas and she changed her mind; so I just got her a dot and show for her birthday. She likes it a lot and it's growing on me, especially as a route to modernizing some of the core household appliances/routines. I was able to very easily connect the wifi outlets I had purchased from TanTan which control some key lamps around the house. We connected a few bluetooth devices and even the two Fire Sticks we had previously. There is some learning to do on both sides. We need to learn how to ask questions the right away and Alexa will learn about our habits, etc. We're still struggling to work out the video calling feature. I'll update on this feature if/when we get the resolution/answer. Connecting/uploading your photos to Amazon photo allows the Show to play through slide-shows when you're not using it for other things. This will connect to Amazon Music, but we have yet to get iTunes connected. (Not sure if this is allowed on the Show.) Impressive how it learns. BE AWARE, the MyQ garage door opening system from Chamberlain requires you to pay them monthly to use their opener with ANY other smart-home device, app or service, such as IFTTT, Google home, Alexa, etc.., Terrible decision! steer clear of their device; there are many out now that will work with other bring your own device smart-home systems/standards. The manual slide to cover the camera and the manual 'mute' button for the microphone is an added bonus but I still wonder if that is more cosmetic than anything else.",4,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I bought this for my mom and I at Christmas, so we could have the joy of spending time together, cooking and working out even when there’s distance between us!  We have Only had it For a few weeks but so far I love it!!!  I’m curious if I can also use it as a electronic photo frame to look at my pictures, but haven’t look into that yet.  Either way it was much worth it!I also purchased a screen protector which I think is kinda crap but it does the job for now, but I do also recommend the more expensive stand that allows you to move the screen in all directions.  It’s magnetic and very sturdy which is perfect if using it in the kitchen, you definitely want something to hold it so you don’t have to worry about spills.

"We have a dot in each room, I don’t understand how anybody could live without, but... how did the echo show slipped past me? It’s amazing we just got done redoing our room and I haven’t set up our TV yet and not knowing much about the echo show I asked her to play a prime movie and To my surprise she opened up my series that I was watching. It is a must have I have no idea how I lived without this, I lose my phone at least five times a day and it is so nice that Alexa can find my phone that alone makes it worth the money LOL",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,1
"I had a first generation Show that died when I broke the cord. When I got my elderly Mom a new Show, it was a great disappointment because the screen was smaller and it was harder to navigate for her. But this new Show 8 is much better than both the smaller one and the older one. The screen is crystal clear, nice resolution. It's as large as the first one, but it comes with a detachable cord, so my recliner can chomp as much of the cord as it likes now. Best of all, the sound is sensational. Full, deep and rich. I love it.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0

"We enjoy the Echo Show for its convenient features: Text while streaming radio, songs, wiki articles, recipes, etc. These are nice features. And the sound quality is good, but sometime Alexa becomes unresponsive and we have to unplug the device to ""reboot"" it. This bug happens when we are streaming radio or playlists and want to stop. Alexa won't respond with the appropriate actions even though it clearly hears the command and the voice. Also, we had to turn to outside sources for figuring out how to call our relatives on their Alexa devices. We tried asking Alexa but she didn't know! :)",4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"I bought this device so I could listen to music on my favorite apps, get news updates and find recipes. The sound quality is surprisingly excellent and the device's appearance is very stylish. However it is very difficult to install apps and to figure out the commands to access the apps you need. Example, if I ask for a specific station on Pandora, it shuffles songs on Pandora instead. You have install the Alexa app on your phone and even then it is not very intuitive or easy to find and install apps. When I finally found Sirius radio the app it wouldn't install. There are many pre installed apps but you cannot see a list of them on the device. Instead the Echo verbally name the app and ask you if you want to try. It would take forever to get the list from the device. I do not have any smart devices linked to the Echo so cannot speak to the usefulness of that feature.  I am very disappointed that there are so many things that Alexa doesn't know the answer to. I will keep the device for the basic use but it did not live up to my expectations.",3,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I was concerned about the chore of having to reconfigure all my connected devices, smart light bulbs, light strips plugs and thermostat.  That turned out to be a non-issue.  I unplugged the old Echo Show and then plugged in the new one, connected to my home network (wi-fi) then signed into my Amazon account.  Everything was there and working, even the apps on my iPhone that adjusted light colors and thermostat settings all worked.  No need to do anything... it was Great.  The new Show  looks much better and takes up less room on the counter and has a sleeker design and larger screen than my old one.  The picture quality is better (not vastly better - but noticeable) and the sound quality is much, much better.  Deeper and richer sounding than the old Show.  It's not on par with a Bose home theater system but, for a small counter top device, music has a very good, quality sound.  My old unit was a first gen Echo Show and that was a good device but this new one is far better all the way around.  I would highly recommend upgrading to this.  Also, I took advantage of Amazon's trade in and got a $30 credit plus a $25 gift card toward the purchase of the new device.  With $55 off you can't go wrong !  One last thought, I bought the stand for the new Echo Show separately, It's not really needed but it's nice to be able to adjust and tllt the unit to avoid screen glare.  It fits on the bottom of the unit perfectly and is magnetic so it stays in place.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,1
"We're very pleased with our Echo 8.  The setup was easy, voice recognition is great and the display is stunning -- as well as entertaining.  The display is constantly changing with respect to backgrounds as well as select information reference news, weather, current events, etc.  Additionally, when Alexa is asked a question or given a task, the display often enhances her answers or adds to a skill, such as timers.  We like it so much, we now have two.  I guess that's the best recommendation we can provide.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

For my needs (weather, sports scores, YouTube videos, and using it as a Bluetooth connected speaker), the Echo Show 8 has shined.  For me, the 8 inch screen is ideal with a relatively small form factor.  All videos are vibrant, look great, and the 8 inch screen is big enough to show details.  My favorite tablets are also in the 8 inch screen range.  I am very satisfied with the sound quality of the Echo Show 8 as well.

This one sounds just about as good, the stereo separation is better, and the screen is a little bigger, even though the overall unit is smaller than the original show.

The reason why I gave only 4 stars on sound quality was because it gives off almost an echo when Alexa talks, unlike my Echo Dot. But I am sure I can play with that a bit.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"I use it primarily to check in on my animals. There are very few instructions that come with the Echo. I have had to unplug it and reboot a couple of times because there was no sound. It would recognize that I asked something, but you couldn't hear a response. Also, when I ""drop in"" from my phone, the icons are confusing. Are they muted when they're white or when they're black? I wish you could get a full manual without an additional charge. I also bought the stand to ""aim"" the camera,  but it's really not very versatile. Only has like 3 positions.",3,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"Up until now I have been a huge Alexa fan and telling everyone how they need to get one.  Prior to Christmas I have had a number of the Alexa throughout the house and had no issues. At Christmas I purchased 2 Alexa Show 8 and 1 Alexa Show 5; I personally use the Show 8's.  I tried and tried hoping a software update was underway but it is driving me crazy.  The device does not hear correctly and often not at all.  I had to stop using the Show 8 as my alarm because 1. It was not going off 2. When I play sleep music all night, the device no longer responds to commands by morning.  The blue light comes on indicating I was heard, but nothing happens.  I give the command to stop the music and nothing happens.  The Only way to resolve is unplug and plug back in....every morning.  So, I went back to using my phone for my alarm.  I hear the wife each morning having to keep yelling at her Show 8 because of the same issue but she is trying to get the alarm to turn off.  Again, the voice command bar indicates she is heard but nothing is happening.  There are times when I drop in and the other person cannot hear me at all, this happens WAY too often.  There have been times I was traveling and dropped into check on the kids.  They could not hear me so just walked away.  Very disappointed.  When the next versions I am asking for complete upgrades with no costs.  No way I will spend additional money until I am sure the device issues and bugs have been resolved.",1,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I bought the echo show + blink camera bundle and it has been perfect for viewing my security cameras while I’m working at my desk. It easily integrates with both Ring and Blink.

"Often times I find myself in the kitchen prepping meals or cleaning or just hanging out and with the Show, I'm able to play music, watch some Hulu or Netflix, and find my happy place. I also love that it's always popping up new recipes to try and many of them have been a hit with family and at parties. I purchased an Echo Dot to go along with it so now I don't have to run from room to room to find someone or deliver a message. Alexa does it for me! This is the best at home helper yet!",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
I love this device; but it is a little cumbersome to navigate. Like if you pause a movie and come back later you have to navigate over to the movies you were playing instead of having it right there.Also the lack of Netflix is just mind blowing.,3,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
We like everything about ECHO 8 ! Can't say enough good things about it. Works great in the kitchen for following recipes or cooking videos. Amazon music sounds great and we can stream on all our devices if we want whole house music going. We have Amazon photos loaded as our home screen and pictures rotate with ease.  If your going to use this in the kitchen please spend the little extra and get the swivel stand to keep your ECHO out of spills or messes while cooking or prepping food.,5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"Originally bought the echo 5 as a Christmas present for my parents and they loved it but the screen was rather small for them. I bought them the 8"" screen and they love it.  A little configuration with the Apexa app and I can call them or 'drop in' to their device and they can see my 6 month old son every day.  Fantastic for calls and they love being able to ask it questions.If you can score a deal like I did ( echo 8 and an echo dot for 79 bucks)  i highly recommend the 8 over the 5",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0

Not really sure what the point of having a screen is then....I got my parents a G o o g l e N e s t H U B M A X (lol) and it plays Youtube perfectly they use it In the kitchen almost as a TV.

The speakers are great and provide the volume for when I want to jam while cleaning and exercising.

Sure enough, just that easily I was watching Prime Video Jack Ryan. I had no idea I could do that!",4,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"First I love this thing, I loved that my wife loves this thing, this was a Xmas present for her, she is in a full time care facility, this echo show allows her choose and play the music and entertainment she likes, without a care givers help, it enables her to call me anytime, and let's me drop in and visit her, I connected it to care facilities WiFi, trained alexa for her voice, and disabled a few things like movie trailers and web browser, until she gets more experience using it",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

"This is a wonderful first device. Our daughter received a Show 5 for Christmas and we wanted a larger one for music and with better sound. At this price point, the Show 8 is ideal. We’ve integrated Spotify into it as well. I don’t understand the negative reviews regarding the “ try this” text at the bottom. It’s not intrusive, you likely aren’t watching TV or movies on here and it’s literally small text. I was hesitant and now am so glad I got this thing. The perfect size, sound, and price.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I bought an Echo Show 5 earlier and like this larger sibling much better, mostly because of its bigger screen--which makes things easier to read and view from farther away--and better sound. I expect that I'll eventually buy a couple more to replace earlier, more limited Echo devices I own that are spread around my home. One knock I had on the Echo Show 5 was that even at its highest brightness setting, the images, etc., seem too dark to me. For whatever reason, that isn't a problem on the Show 8.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
Set up was incredibly simple.  The screen is much more practical in my view than the Echo Show 5.  I was impressed that I could stop the cycling of comments and pictures.  I have it where my handicapped wife can see it and I can use drop in to check on her.  She was bothered by the changing screen.  The fact that I could turn that off made it great for our purposes.  The only thing I would prefer is if I could turn off the notification sound when I do a drop in to chech on her when she is sleeping.  Overall I am extremely impressed with it and have ordered a second unit.,5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
on the most part echo show is good ! but I had problems with freezing and privacy issues !! if you have others on your acct. even if they are on a different wi fi 20 miles away theyDONOT need permission to drop in !! they CAN answer your calls if that person is also in there contacts and can listen in just by saying answer alexa!! this did happen to me and can happen to you!!  as for video call its great and all other features I love .

"I absolutely love my echo show 8, I spent hours debating on getting this one or the 10 and trying to decide which one was better for the affordable price and I am telling you with my black Friday deal it was definitely even better. The only differences that kept me going back and forth were that the 8 has a 1 megapixel camera where as the 10 has a 5 megapixel camera and the 10 is 2 inches bigger but let me tell you the camera is great, sound quality amazing and loud so no regrets here! I might still get the echo show 10 down the road just because I love my alexa/echo gadets but right now I am thrilled and happy with my echo show 8. I would highly recommend it.

These ""ads"" that I've read so many bad reviews and angry reviews about are not really ads, just like everything else it is giving recomendations, as you can see in the picture I sent both echo shows I have, have them at times of none use so just sitting there, but they don't pop up like ads for car dealers or like big sales going on. They are just recomendations. I don't mind them, she doesn't say them to you, they just show up when you aren't doing anything or talking to her.

My only problem is I can’t get it to pair with Bluetooth so I can listen thru my stereo.  Will continue to work on that.

"We have both the Echo dot and the Echo Show 5 as well as the Echo Show 8. Having all three devices allows for a great comparison. Each device has its place and each is an excellent value (what it will do for what you pay).Buying them when they are on sale is the way to go, given that they have frequent sales (worth the wait). But of the three, the Echo Show 8 really blows the others away. First, having the video screen brings significant advantages to the Echo Show 5 and 8 (the number represents the approximate diagonal size of the screen in inches). Being able to watch videos, see news as text and have the words for songs show up (they do for most Amazon Music songs) makes the Echo Shows well worth the investment. The sound on all three Echos is excellent, but the Show 5 has deeper bass and better volume than the dot and the Show 8 has about three times the volume of the Show 5, with excellent bass. And the larger screen on the Show 8 is not only larger than the Show 5, but much brighter.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0

I also wished I could get netflix and disney+. But eh. Love itUpdating this. I bought this in December 2019 and it is now August 2020. Dropping it down to 3 stars.

"The Show 8 lacks customization options that the Show 5 apparently has.  You can change the background and what data scrolls through, but the size of the time, the temp and showing today's date at all are not options.  You also constantly get Alexa suggestions.  Many tips on customization seem to be for other devices as there is no ""Home and Clock"" setting on the Show 8.  The only clock setting is 24 HR.  My mistake for thinking the 8 and the 5 had similar features, but the Show 8 options seem very lacking for any device with a screen.  But then the misleading tips on using the Show 8 didn't help that misunderstanding.The frustrating thing is that the Show 8 is almost a very good product. It just lacks basic customization which takes away from its other features.  If it had the UI of the Show 5, likely this would be a 5 star review.

I had a chat with support in which they said ""it has already been escalated to be fixed in a future update"". They HAVE a switch (see pics) to turn it off that simply doesn't work on the Show 8, it does work on the Show 5.

We had hoped to do video calls with the grandparents but so far after a month we still haven’t done even one.

My only issue is that, we use YouTube, disney + and other streaming services that the Echo Show is not compatible or wont integrate. It does have Hulu, but now a days there are so many different streaming services that if this device was compatible, it would be a solid 5 star. Also as far as more features, it would be nice to have a maps feature or a better search engine integration. Hence that is  where the google devices are a bit better when it comes to searching directions or certain restaurants near you.

I think the nest doorbell is better I don’t want to change. I haven’t sent it back hoping Amazon will correct this problem. Amazon customer service was not helpful at all on this matter.,4,1,2019-12-22,1,1,0
Traded in my original Echo Show for this newest Echo Show that Amazon sells.  I was worried that the screen might be too small but it's actually bigger and brighter than the one I had on the original Echo Show.  Sound is good and the voice recognition is excellent.  Definitely a good trade up!,5,1,2020-8-14,1,1,0
It basically is an over priced echo dot.  I spend more time trying to say instructions in the right way that it will understand what I need that it just makes more sense for me to look it up myself on the computer.  It has tons of skills but do not understand what most of them do because just gives vague descriptions.  I will keep because I like the alarm clock and to listen to music but will stick to the cheaper dots until it is capable expanding on what you are asking of it.,3,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I like it because, unlike the Google Home Mini, you can rename it. Mom has an Echo Show and I have one too. Mine is named Echo and hers is named Alexa. No more blasting of all devices at once when I ask a question.  Very nice. The video is exceptional. We are going to give one to my niece who is having a baby. We can use the 'drop in' mode to say hello anytime without having to make a telephone call. Kids can talk to Grandma without making a telephone call. Truly hands-free. Yahoo.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"I disagree with Amazon's design team here. I'm looking for similar features between the Echo 5 and the Echo 8. Specifically, the ability to the ""Home & Clock"" experience. This experience is present with the Echo 5.With the Echo 8, Amazon design team made a conscious design choice to **remove** this experience.",2,1,2020-7-15,1,1,0
"Mostly very satisfied with this alexa device.  We bought it primarily for the slideshow feature to replace an old digital photo frame in our kitchen.  The Show 8 that we bought looks good and is the right size, but I'll be damned if I can figure out how to change the speed at which the pictures change in the slideshow.  I've searched hi and lo, and while there are instructions for doing this, they do not match the preferences/options in our device.  So, the pics change really, really slowly.  Hoping this gets fixed in a firmware update or something.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I could go on and on about all the cool things you can do with Alexa connected to a touch-screen video display, but you probably already know these things.  What you might not know is that the Echo Show 8 has really great sound too!  Put up against a Bose Wave System the Show stands up well - the highs aren't quite as crisp as the Bose and the Show's sound is more directional than the Bose - BUT it's well rounded, full, clear and pleasing sound powerful enough  fill any room.  We really like it!",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
So far this has been an enjoyable product. I got it to connect all of my devices that worked with an Alexa. She is definitely not a google tho. This product is more for entertaining. We have asked her several questions that she did not have an answer to. She is a little stubborn with her demands at times. I may have to ask her more than once. My favorite feature is having song lyrics pop up while listening to music. You can not view your amazon cart on this device. Picture quality is good.,4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1

"The echo show is a great center piece to the smart home.  It is able to recognize voices very well and naturally interacts with all of the Alexa services.  The improvements that I would like to have is the ability to order the way that services are accessed (when requesting a song, directing the device to pull from Amazon Music before Spotify), the ability to access additional video apps like Netflix, and a typing search feature within videos.  If I ask for The Avengers from Alexa, I get some song from Spotify instead of the video (even if I am already on the videos screen to provide context.)But please don't read those improvements as a negative review of the product itself.  It's a solid piece of equipment that makes the home bar much more fun.  It runs the lights, sounds, and helps to order new supplies.  The interface has already been improved, and I don't doubt that it will continue to get better.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"Got this thinking it would work with new Blink cameras, but what good is it when it won't show video or warning when cameras are motion-activated. Amazon says the Echo Show and the Blink software doesn't allow that. That renders it useless. And the Try ""Alexa"" suggestions that CONSTANTLY appear across the screen are driving me batty. There's no way to stop them, it just makes me want to take EVERY Alexa device in my house and throw them into the garbage bin. I should've listened to the other reviewers. That Try ""Alexa"" thing is like living in The Twilight Zone...it just won't stop, it keeps coming after you. I'll give Amazon one week to fix that...give me a way to turn it off, and if not...then I'll be sending this thing back.",2,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
I have both the Google Nest Hub (7 inch display) and the Amazon Echo show 5 and 7.  There were a few things that reviews online did not emphasized and actually place Google as the winner between the 2 and I have a different opinion because of the following.  I think Echo show is a better option for some because of the following...1.  Echo Show 8 has a bigger screen than Google Nest Hub.  Echos Show 5 is about $20 less the Google Nest Hub.,5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0

I enjoy the interesting subjects to ask about flashing up on the screen as well as seeing my appointments and reminders pop up.

I don't do video calling, it will show me my front door on voice command (and answer by voice if I wish) with my ring doorbell which is nice but hardly justifies the cost, music  quality is good, I can watch Prime video but I can do that on my smart TV with a much bigger screen.  Still learning about this viewer and hoping to find some other uses that might make me glad I bought the thing.

Loved that I was able to do an upgrade and with the sale, plus the 25% discount and the $30 trade in Gift Card (which they gave me to use instantly) it was a steal!  I was going to get the 2nd Generation Echo Show because I loved the 10in screen, but I didn't think the $100 difference was worth the extra 2in.  I know it also has a few other features, but those didn't matter to me.  I couldn't find any reviews that compared the Echo Show 1st Gen with the Echo Show 8.  I wasn't sure that just 1in in screen size would be that much of a difference, but it really did!  The sound is so much better than the 1st generation too.  So glad I did the upgrade.  I also purchased a stand for it.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,1

"This is another great device from Amazon. The sound quality is great for as small as this device is. Works as expected. One downside for me (which is why 4 stars instead of 5) is the show uses WiFi data continuously. I have a data allowance per month I am allowed to use on my home WiFi. The echo dots do not use WiFi until you tell it the ""wake"" word. This would be a nice feature to turn on/off on the show devices for others out there with the same problem.

"The host of Amazon Alexa products I just purchased was somewhat disappointing but I'm hoping their technology will catch up with Google and Apple as far as integration, connectivity and AI. I bought 4 echo dots, 1 Echo Show 8, a Fire stick and a Toshiba Fire TV. So far, Alexa is pretty limited in her capabilities because you have to download apps to do basic things Siri and Google Assistant can already do without all the extra setup and work. Also, the connectivity is spotty and understand I have a Netgear Nighthawk with 2 mesh extenders. The coverage is good. The other issue is the Toshiba Fire TV remote quit working in the first month of ownership. The Echo Dots I thought I could sync like a home theater as Amazon advertises but apparently only on certain devices that they don't warn you about first. So basically it can't perform a basic important function I bought it for. All in all the possibilities there, but so far my experience has been very disappointing. I've used Google for years but loved the concepts Amazon is trying to accomplish. Their technology just doesn't seem to be there yet which is surprising.",3,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

When not talking to my daughter, Alexa keeps me entertained with music on demand (sound quality is great), and I'm still learning about other ""skills"" and features.

The sound quality is great, and once you get the hang of the voice commands it's easy to set. I wish it gave me more control the clock display, but that's a minor nit. I'm impressed by the number of radio stations (I'm an NPR geek, and all the stations I listen to I can get), and by the way it connects to my Spotify account.

"I have not even utilized most of the features available on the Echo Show 8, but I still love it! I don’t know why people complain so much about the messages across the bottom of the screen. It’s not like you are staring at the screen all day! The scenery changes during the day so it’s not the same screen or you can customize it. I just love being able to view things while hearing about it by Alexa. My favorite so far are the recipes, but it shares news articles that I wouldn’t have seen if it weren’t for the “Try This“ tips showing across the bottom of the screen. The screen is HD and looks really great even watching YouTube and music videos. I love the video call feature as well. It’s just a great product that I would recommend to anyone!",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I've had mine for about 4 months now and for the most part it was working beautifully. NOW for some reason it no longer reads my Audible books. It says, ""Sorry, I'm having trouble playing to book."" for any book I attempt to have it read. Prime videos play with no problems but not my Audible books. Really annoying.  One other thing, I wish the clock stayed centered. You have that nice big screen and the clock is usually floating off to the side somewhere.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"This is my first time with a tech product like this. I just got it for Christmas, and I am not currently using it to it's full capabilities (video call, smart home) and still playing around with it.  It does have some really cool features and can do way more than I expected. Sound quality is great for playing music. Setup was super easy.  But sometimes I feel that if asking a question I could get a better/faster answer if I googled it on my phone. I considered getting this for my older parents but decided it was too complicated for them and would cause a lot of headaches.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

I like being able to turn camera off. would have liked to have more indept instruction, like trying to add slide show to screen saver of photo from my photos, got caught up in amazon photo and it only down loaded some of my photos not the ones I checked to be in screen saver. would love to have a choice to stop all the advertisement. I recommend the show. I would give it a 5 star if the instruction was better and advertisement I could stop.",3,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
I bought one on a trade in deal and I have it next to the bed for an alarm and for smart light operation.  I really like the suggestions of skills and things to ask Alexa.  It displays news and has my photos constantly scrolling the home screen.  These newer Alexa devices have great microphones.  The older ones seemed to have a problem when the music was playing and volume was up high.  You'd have to yell over the music. Not these new ones.  Great product.,5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
I dislike nearly everything about this thing. The most frustrating is a complete lack of any instruction with the device. And I resent having to fork out another $10 for a separate manual on how to work it. I got in order to have video calls with elderly mother as she doesn’t have FaceTime on her smartphone. And I’m not comfortable granting access to all my contacts when all I’m looking for a s to manually add one.  Ready to send the dang thing back.,1,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0

I am impressed with the echo show 8. I bought the echo show 5 and it was a great device and worked flawlessly except for one problem..the sound was pitiful. The show 8 is fantastic and the sound isn't earth shattering but its sound quality is really nice and is good for listening to music. It has some bass and doesn't sound distorted at max volume but fans of bass heavy music may find it disappointing. The microphones hear me easily when I say the wake word while playing music. I hot the show 8 on sale for$100 and its an even better deal for the lowered price of $100,5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0

I have only had it for a couple of months and I am disappointed in the service and support or should I say lack of support.

No one will answer the phone and there is no option to return it even though it is still under warranty.,1,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
"Does not integrate with fire tv cube in same room well. Not the best at recognizing wake word. Have to use different command than cube. Ask for lyrics to a song, but only gives the first verse. Asked for song release date. Stated a  much later. The camera is angle so that if sitting at a table you have to place something under it to tilt camera down. Probably designed so you have to buy a expensive stand. Most of Alexa appearscto be getting dumber.",2,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

"I purchased the Echo Show to put in my kitchen so I could bring up recipes on Pinterest or other websites while I'm cooking.  I was using my phone prior to this but the screen would go dark and I'd have to wake it every 20 seconds.

We originally purchased an echo show five when we started getting all of our home automation products when we discovered the show eight I fell in love because the screen was so much larger and easier to read and search for products. I have used it to make several recipes and my kids love that they can see the lyrics to the songs on the screen when we play music. The only problem I have had is there are times when I try to speak to her that she does not recognize  the command that I am giving and performs a different task or does nothing at all.

"The device is well-designed, with good sound. Basic set-up is straight-forward. The settings menus are limited and selecting certain options have unexpected consequences. Two browser options are provided. Initially, I went with FireFox but found that it timed out after five minutes despite trying everything. Amazon's Silk seems to not have the same problem. Given how long this product has been available, it's strange that some of these issues haven't been addressed.

I have had Echo with Alexa for several years and have enjoyed them.  This one has the show that makes all the difference.  It shows you the words when playing the music with words.  Is shows recipes you want to find and holds them on screen while you follow the recipe. It connects to audible and reads to you.  It researches something you want to know and tells you about it. I am learning more everyday and I am thrilled with Echo Show 8!,5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Love this one. Size is good. Sound is good. Price was really good on sale. But Alexa needs to get smarter. Too many I don’t knows and the music on prime does not allow you to play  more than one song at a time. Come on Amazon- you sold me one for every room. Now you want another 15 dollars a month if someone in my family wants to listen to something else.

It should have the option to display a cam on the home screen at all times! Maybe it’s a skill I haven’t found, but seriously disappointed that integration isn’t there yet, and if it does, why isn’t it really easy to find?  That is the main disappointment in the first 24 hours.",3,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
The new software makes this so easy to setup and integrate with Alexa and Ring. Now when someone rings the doorbell they immediately are displayed on the screen. A very useful feature. Setup only required selecting the correct WIFI network/password and signing this device to our Amazon account. We use the Smarthome APP and it appeared as a choice on the setup screen and I am not sure if that is why integration was so seamless. Great product.,5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
Don't quite know how to use it yet but it certainly looks good.  I bought two for bedrooms that are far apart. It was able to answer a couple of easy questions but it could not tell me it's serial number. The printed serial number on the back was too small to read for my old eyes so I used a barcode scanner. Didn't actually need it since the SN was on Amazon's order. Very nice. The second Echo Show did not arrive with the first one but that's ok.,5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0

Some of the random things that show up as Alexa suggestions are pretty odd and they do show up all the time, but I can ignore them for the most part and a few of them have actually been good suggestions.

"We upgraded to this from a non-show Echo - we put it in the same spot the other one was in and everything - and I was very surprised at how much worse the microphone was, both in hearing my wake up command and interpreting my speech. I'm not sure if it's becuase where the mic's are on the Show or if the mic's on the Show are inferior, but it definitely DECREASES the usefulness of the Echo. The sound is still good, but it seemed better on my old Echo. Again, I wonder if it's b/c where the speakers are placed.",2,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0

I am not alone in this, as Amazon's own forums and many blogs online also feel that this nag should be controllable by the user.

The 1 is turned all the way up, and have moments when I can hear what is being said to the 8, sometimes not at all. Amazon blew it with both the 5 and the 8. I’m returning the 8 and am so frustrated I’m looking at alternative non-amazon devices. I’m an Alexa super-user and it’s taking a lot for me to give up on them. But enough is enough.

Instead, it has a clock that occupies about 2 percent of the screen in the upper-left corner and that may actually be SMALLER than the Echo Dot’s display.ADDENDUM: In Night Mode, the clock is somewhat bigger - about 10 percent of the screen in the lower left corner.

Still hoping to get the wake to classical music function to perform as well as the 5; I expect to get there.

Please make a special  “seniors edition”. My grandma calls Alexa everything but Alexa and I wish she understood names that were similar to hers. She ends up yelling at it and unplugging it!

It's nice to have a screen to look at when u ask for weather and news but it doesn't work with alexa app so it's a lot harder to set up even tho u have a screen to look at during set up. And surprisingly the screen doesn't have many options to use with it mostly cameras everything u can do with an echo and TV. I'd of thought the screen would of had more options. It's nice but not what I expected. Guess it's cheaper than portal lol if u want to video chat with fam but it'd harder to use than an echo and does half the things echo does. Id say good for kitchen stuff over bedroom. It's nice to wake up to a clock and weather but I'm sure cheaper options for just that. In kitchen u can look up recipes and make shopping list or order products.,3,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
Only one issue  that bothers us is all the advertisements and recommendations you cannot turn off. Otherwise it's a great item to have in the house. The Echo 8 blows away the echo 5 that's for sure. The quality of the picture and sound is amazing. I always use Alexa when I'm cooking or just cleaning up the house. Video calling is great..just remember the other person needs to have a similar item like the echo 8 or the 5 or even the 10,4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"I bought this item for my husband who was transferred to a rehab from the hospital.  He was being isolated while in the rehab for 14 days....so, there was no way to see him.  He had been in the hospital for 30 days after testing positive for Covid 19.  He has neuropathy in his hands and it is difficult for him to use a cell phone....I thought this would be a good way for us to be in contact.  Since I wasn't able to go into the rehab to set up the echo show, I had to rely on the staff there....they were not familiar with the item, so, we never got to the point of them placing the show in a position for me to actually have a video chat, but, it did enable my husband to just tell Alexa to call me, which was worth everything..and it did enable him to listen to his favorite internet radio station all day and evening....since being home, we now are able to video chat with our kids who don't live in the same state as we do....it is a great item to use, in many different ways...I haven't even tried all the other stuff it is capable of .....LOVE IT.....",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

The audio and video quality is very very good. I think this is one of the best Echo devices out there, if not the best. It also is quite expensive but I love it.

Overall it is a good product and I really like the photo screen saver function as well as a quick view of the weather and other items.The one major downfall is the microphone is terrible. Echo show can't hear if it is actually being used for music or similar media and is poor at best when it is silent in the house.

Also, I can't seem to control the brightness of the screen by routine or voice command.  The lack of certain video services like Disney+ and Netflix is a definite drawback.

The echo 8 delivered big! I would recommend and have bought some as gifts. IMO this is the “baby bear” echo, it’s size is just right.

I also  find sometimes that I can listen to podcasts when I have pages and pages of documents to scroll through, although when I have to pay attention to what I'm reading, I find the podcasts too distracting so I tend to switch back to spa music, but I always have something playing now and I'm finding I really enjoy it.

"Bought this as part of a recent sale on the Echo 8 and trade-in offer (25% and $30 for first gen).First off, the screen and speed of the echo is excellent compared to the first gen that is slow and lower resolution.  Commands are better understood and dimming options improved too!",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
Worth every penny. The set up is a breeze and very intuitive. The feature are amazing. I use Skype for most of my phone calls and the integration with my smartphone makes it a breeze. I also have started to convert my home into a smart house. Alexander controlled my smart bulbs and outlets with no slips. I found Wyze products to be the easiest to integrate. I sent back another manufacturer's outlets because I couldn't get them to work.,5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"We really like this one-not too big for the counter but not too small to see from a distance. Sound quality is very nice and we like being able to coordinate our Amazon music through the Echo into different rooms. It's nice to have the option to listen to music, podcasts, radio, news or watch shows on demand.

"I love my Echo Show!!! I know many people complain about the ads for different skills running across the bottom of the screen. Personally, I don't mind them at all. Sometimes they give me ideas of things to try with Alexa. I love being able to pull up recipes in the kitchen. The screensaver shows our photos that we have in Amazon Photos.After having it set up for a couple of months, I have no complaints! I now have 3 different Alexa devices. I am considering getting another Echo Show for upstairs now.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"We got this as a gift.  My wife doesn't like the invasion of privacy by Amazon, but we take the bad with the good.  Having music in the kitchen is fun.  We have used it for recipes a few times.

I considering putting a sensor on my garage door as we leave with it open now and then",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I am very impressed with the sound quality of this product. In addition, when I ask Alexa to play music types, such as love songs, her compilation presentation is superb. The suicide videos from VEVO are awesome, too. When I call, “Alexa, play soulful music videos.” She immediately starts the videos. This is true for any category or specific artists or songs. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product. Ask this lady anything, music, definitions, benefits, weather, scores, etc..",5,1,2020-1-20,1,1,1
"The Alexa show is a great idea. I keep the camera off and don't need this feature since my phone can do all this. I use the video feature for recipes and watching sports highlights. One major flaw of this product is the voice recognition. I have several Alex products and even though I am in the same room as the Alex show, sometimes the other Alex respond instead of the one closest to me. This needs to be improved.",3,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"There is not as much customization as would be expected.  When playing siriusxm, rather than going to the home screen or showing any content, the device just stays on a static page with the station displayed.  I can force it to home by speaking, but would like an option to ""auto home"" on static screen app display.  Additional customization options for the home screen would also be nice.  Sound quality, on the other hand, is amazing, with a good wide range and no distortion.  In all this is a really good device, and after a few more updates, more customization options may be available.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
I love this device. I really like that I can put pictures for the face while not in use. It's pretty easy to set up. I am still learning all of the things it can do but I am happy with it so far.

"The sound for it size is remarkable. Great for video calls. I also like the ongoing information provided like news ,weather etc. Another plus is the Alexa integration. One design aspect that I found bothersome was the angle of the screen. I wound up placing an object under the back of the unit to raise the rear so the screen angle was less. Not a big deal but a future design change that would allow adjustment of the viewing angle should be considered..",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
Lo esperaba con muchas expectativas. La instalación y configuración inicial es demasiado sencilla. Prácticamente se realiza sola. Sin embargo la instalación de skills importantes para dispositivos inteligentes no funcionan como debería (Xiaomi por ejemplo).También nos llevó tiempo lograr la instalación de Spotify y Prime Video.

"I have a couple of Echo 5's (bedroom, kitchen) which I really liked so I purchased an Echo 8 for my office. I'm an author and have grown spoiled with Alexa.

I also appreciate being able to make announcements to my husband in another room without having to yell or get up (not lazy, LOL!).",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,1
"The Echo Show 8 works as it should but has some downfalls IMO. First is the lack of Clock Faces that the Show 5 has, actually the 8 has none. I use this in the bedroom and would love to be able to look over and see a clock in the same screen position every time. Second is the screen does not truly dim at night, it will put out enough light on it's dimmest setting to light my bedroom enough to see everything in the room clearly. I wanted a desktop assistant with a clock not a nightlight that my 2 and 4 year old grandchildren would be happy with. I am disappointed enough with the Show 8 that I am going to purchase a Google Home Hub.",2,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
I am hoping that they come out with a camera system that allows local storage for these units. As of yet they have you over the barrel paying for the cloud storage which is crap. I like them because the wife can quick look up recipes and these display our family pictures. I also built outside sockets in five zones to turn on and off our Christmas display in the winter and no more messing with timers. There are a lot of possibilities here with these units if Amazon doesn't get any more greedy. Time will tell.,4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I have Echo show 5, 7 and now 8.  Eight is outstanding.  Set up was a dream.  It works great with my Ring doorbell.  It lets me know when someone is at the door and when I ask to see the ""front door"", my Echo Show 8 switches to the front door camera.  This is an app improvement and now my Show 5 and 7 let me know when someone is there.  Of course you must install the ""Ring"" skill.  Works like a dream.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for our family all to use. We are still learning all of its different functions and features but so far so good. I got the slate version and it's a very attractive device, much like the Google Nest Hubs. Really good sound playing music and it recognizes voices accurately. We already have an Echo so the two can work in tandem. I've streamed a movie on Prime while cooking in the kitchen and it accomplished that beautifully. Also a great buy, since I got it during the Black Friday deals so it was discounted, even though just released. Recommended!",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

"So it has been a learning curve.  I only had an Alexa echo dot until now.  My sister has a older model as does my 80+ yr old mom.  We have figured out how to call each other but are still in learning mode.  If anyone has some tips, please share.  The sound quality on the 8 is really good for music and news but there seems to be a delay in the calls sound.  Also, sometimes my echo dot wants to answer and not the show.  I ended the communication for the dot but it seems to revert back.  Again still learning.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"We were looking for a replacement for the Dot and the price point difference between the 5"" & 8"" was not significant so it was a no brainer at that point. Once we agreed on the placement setting it up was easy and quick. Literally took a couple of minutes. Plugged it in, answered a few questions and off we go. Connected the Wyze cam to this, the screen is so clear we can see it across the room. My fiance's favorite part is when she's listening to music and the lyrics are shown on the screen she can sing along like with a karaoke.",4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
I do not know why Amazon released this large version of the echo without a large clock. I would like to be able to read the time without squinting. Until amazon changes this easy to fix software feature I will not remove my 1 star review,1,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0
"I like everything about this except for the Alexa ""Try this.... "" recommendations that are on the screen.

It’s been helpful for news, remembering to add groceries to my list while right there in the kitchen and I ran out of something as I was cooking.

"Had a Spot by our bedside for several years, never satisfied w/ the very small screen size or poor speaker. We added a better-quality bluetooth speaker but it was too much clutter on bedstand. Several weeks back, Amazon offered a very small credit  trade-in so we purchased the Show 8. Screen size would have been perfect, but unlike Spot & other Show models there was no way to change the clock face display, so the numbers were very small & unreadable for my wife & I. We returned it for credit (not a good experience) & eventually got a Show 5....which is PERFECT for us! Price has dropped in the 10 days since we purchased, darn.",2,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0

"The only good thing about this device is the screen for searching videos, with that being said this was hands down the worst Echo product I’ve owned.The main problem I had with the device was it would constantly stop playing music in the middle of a song or if it was connected to my group it would pick and choose which songs it decided it wanted to play while my other devices (Echo 2nd and 3rd generation and Dot) continue to play music. This device must have been programmed by an angry wife because the “Alexa” on this device does not listen to a word you say or at least my device didn’t, I get the chime at the start of my request “Alexa volume X....OK” or sometimes she won’t even acknowledge my request. The sound quality was great and I like the camera for checking  on my dogs while I’m out. Over all I was not impressed and decided to return for the Echo studio.",2,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0

I am really enjoying my Echo Show 8.  Love being able to view security camera on it and playing music..plus all the other stuff you can do.  .  The speakers are great.  I never expected it to sound as good as it does.  I have read where people complain about the suggestions at the bottom....they do not bother me at all.  In fact I like the suggestions.  In my opinion Echo Show 8 beats Google hands down.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
How did I ever live without this in my life. Want to hear a certain song? Ask alexa. Cont figure out that guyvwjo was in that movie? Ask alexa. Want to talk to my son on the other end of the house? Dont yell ask alexa to drop in. Want to reorder your arm brace that tgw dog has eaten for the third time? Just tell alexa. After a week i no longer have to speak to my spouse or child. It is amazing,5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0

"I’ve always been skeptical of the Echo devices and didn’t see much use for them. I figured it was nothing more than just a glorified Bluetooth speaker. I was immensely surprised after seeing a friend video to his mother on his Echo Show 5. The video and sound quality were equally good.  He then showed me the other Echo devices he had placed around his home and was explaining the different “skills” Alexa was capable of. I don’t remember much of what he said because I busy ordering my own device at the same time. I also ordered one for my mother as well and she absolutely loves it. It’s good to know that Alexa is constantly learning new skills so the device is getting “smarter”, which hopefully, will make it even a more enjoyable experience.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

The best is that it works with several camera devices, that can display on the screen with just a few words. Works with Ring, Arlo and Wyze devices. Really like this device.",4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0

The distance between our homes,  vanishes as we talk each morning.  Since my sister's husband died, she needed someone to talk to any time of the day or night;  we use the show.

The Echo Show 8 is like a Fire table but fatter.  I'm not impressed by anything so far.  My Echo Dot picks up my voice better than the Echo Show 8.  I think the audio and microphone issues is due to the fact that there is no stand (but this is just my guess).,2,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0

I love this item. It does everything you would want. It has Alexa Integration. It has prime video and prime music. You have a Ring doorbell? It works with that too. People giving it 1 or 2 star reviews only because it has a Try Alexa message are being nit picky at best. You can make it so it only shows up on the home screen.

Don’t like that you can’t conference call and it should be equipped with a swivel instead of having to purchase separately.

"I've been satisfied so far, whisper recognition how cool is that, being considerate of others, big screen to show what you want to have alexa show, down fall, the screen does not sleep when in idle or no option, when you want the room dark, I regret not getting the adjustable stand, it would have come in handy, I'd recommend this product we are having fun with it, more to learn.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
The screen constantly shows things to try on the bottom of the home screen. This can't be turned off. I know everything it can do since my I have had an echo for years and years. I don't need this message spit in my face every time I look at the screen. I would NOT recommend this product and may just send it back for this reason. Buy the google one you'll be much happier,2,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"The Alexa Show 8 arrived and was easy set up in my living room. Almost everything is perfect EXCEPT Alexa now says of my lights in the living room that they are not supported by the room. This is nonsense; they certainly are. And there are no other issues with the rooms and lights and Hue Bridge. I have found no work around anywhere. Extremely annoying issue, especially when no help is offered.",4,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I like the ease of set up and integration with my other devices, Alexa/Blink/Ring, etc.  The display is better than anticipated.  I am still playing around with it but so far I am impressed and will likely order a second device.  Good job Amazon!I only rated four stars because I haven't had it long enough to rate a five yet.  I will update after a few weeks/months.",4,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"I received this as Christmas gift and am completely thrilled.  I saw more than a few negative reviews about the ads that show on the home screen. I have to say it does not bother me at all. Not like I am constantly staring at the screen like a TV.  I  love that I can ask Alexa what time is the game on and she answers me, or tell Alexa to add an item to my shopping list as soon as I notice I am out of some item that is not a ""weekly buy"".  Setting alarms and playing music are easy as asking Alexa do it!  My Mom and brother also have this so now we can video chat and it is great.  I just need to get some smart plugs so I can control some light and such.  I am not very Tech savvy and I did not have any trouble figure out how to get the most out this unit...and there is always google to help answer any questions or get step by step instructions for what you need.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I owned an echo show before, the thinner one and loved it as an alarm clock.  It bothered me that the pictures I stream in the background were cropped.  This solves that issue.  It is a little bright for an alarm clock according to my wife, but other than that we love it.  It is big enough to actually watch shows or movies on it bedside.  The audio could use a little more quality.",4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
My daughter and I love it. She’s at the age where she can stay home alone and it gives her much comfort knowing I’m just a call away. We tried it out. I went down the street hung out. She thought I went to the store. And I dropped in on her and she was fine. Waited a little longer she called me to see what I was doing. It also gave me comfort knowing we can get ahold of each other.Music is awesome. Had many things you can do. But the main thing we use It for is to FaceTime.,5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"THE AUDIO QUALITY IS TERRIBLE. I sent the first one back and the 2nd one does the same thing.  Music streaming cuts in and out, low/terrible bitrate.  Even with an excellent wifi signal strength.

"How could this not have been in my home before! I’m seriously glad I purchased it during the holiday season. It was out of stock but I purchased it anyway and it was well worth the wait! There’s so much that you can do. For me it was my baby monitor. Since I have two floors and the nursery is upstairs I just put a Wyze cam on the crib and voila! “Alexa show me the crib” and presto! Genius! And don’t settle with just the Show 5. Believe me you’ll be disappointed in the sheer size of the thing. For around $80 and it came with an Echo Dot for my upstairs, you can’t beat that.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
I docked 1 star because I feel like there should be more video type skills to add to your Show.  I also think that its greatly missing a feature of casting or sending webpages to your show from your phone.  My wife wanted to use a recipe that she found on her phone and was unable to figure out how to get it on the show.  Overall the device is great and we like having it.,4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
We love it. Even though Alexa goes rouge sometimes and answers questions not remotely close to what we asked. We love requesting songs and seeing the lyrics scroll on the screen.

We have ours in the kitchen and it is a great addition.,5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I have only had this for a few days, but I love it. Matching visual with Alexa's voice is so much better. I love that it accesses my Ring doorbell fairly fast. It shows lyrics when playing music.

"Love, love, love the Echo Show. I got this at Christmas, and am still discovering what I can do. We have it in the kitchen, as that’s where everything happens. Echo goes dormant if the room is dark, but when we walk in it “wakes up” with a screen of your choice  (ours is set to paintings) also the time and local temperature. It shows news highlights and other items that you’re interested in. Since it’s in the kitchen , we look up a lot of recipes and can store those recipes and access later. I haven’t tried the video chat yet, because we need to find people who also have Alexa or the Echo Show. So far, we’re the only ones in our family.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I like the screen size and the pixilation is great. I do however have a challenge with voice recognition.

I had the smaller Alexa Show in the same spot where this o. e is currently, and I never had those issues.",3,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I am disappointed in the show. Maybe my expectations were too high. I read independent reviews evaluating the show vs Google products. The Results were close but for the money the show 8 was recommended.But finding the skills and getting them to work seems to be problematic. For example, I found a skill that reads stories for kids. It shows multiple stories but when I ask it to read a story we get the same story every time. When I ask for kids songs one time I get a great selection the next time it’s the same 6 songs over and over.",3,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"This is a great product. The sound quality is amazing and so is the voice recognition. The biggest downside here is that it’s not compatible with Youtube, Netflix, Peacock and some other streaming apps. Your stock with Amazon Music and Amazon Video. What’s the point of having a screen if you can’t access the services you love. I just returned and bought a Google Home Hub.",4,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I gave it 3 stars because you can’t turn off the suggestions and you can’t go directly to a website, you have to go to google first and then a website. (I called echo support to check). I can type it faster. Other than that it is as described and like every other Alexa device. It has a rather large footprint so be sure to take that into consideration of trying to decide between sizes.",3,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0

"I recently added the 8 inch Echo Show to my home accessories of 2 existing Echos, a dot and standard configuration.  I located the Show in our dinning nook so that we could see the camera coverage and also use it for timers, information and music.

It creeps out my wife a bit for she feels that not only can Alexa now hear us but also sees us.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"This show has a large screen, in fact larger than I anticipated, which is not a bad thing. Since my spouse is handicapped she answers the ring doorbell and accesses our Arlo cameras through Alexa.

I don’t really watch movies but I think it has a large enough screen for that.",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"I was using my iPad 3 as a alarm clock for the past few years, but Apple let me down over the years. So, I switch out my Apple products with better gears. After changing my iPhone to a Samsung Galaxy Note and Apple Watch to Samsung Galaxy Watch, I figured to change out my iPad-turned-alarm clock to a smart clock or smart display clock. Echo Show 8 was all I need and more. It is the perfect size for my nightstand and very easy controls to understand. I gained more than a alarm clock, I got a personal assistant who can turn on and off my tv. As well as getting smart light bulbs for Echo Show to become a master switch and the set the lights to a specific color or dimming settings. Thank you Amazon for creating an amazing product for a 21th century home.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"It took a while for me to decide to buy this. My old alarm want looking very good. Then it went on sale and I was able to make payments. I figured “eh, let’s go for it”. I absolutely love it! I can say “”Alexa add milk to my shopping list” which she does and I can bring up on my phone when I go to the store, because like most people I make a list and then guess what.....leave it home. surprise! As far as the things to try....I think people are just looking for something to complain about. I absolutely LOVE it! Especially the recipes,  There was one called baked ziti, it was delicious, but HUGE I spent $40 on ingredients. Wasn’t as good reheated though. Alexa can also play sleep sounds to help you drift off, you just have to sign up Amazon music, I believe for $3.99 a month. Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,1

I don’t like that I can’t turn off the skill ideas. ...ask Alexa this... it is very annoying!I do love the recipe ease in my kitchen and my photo wallpaper show!

We just use this device for fun. We do not have any interest in controlling our house through it. The first thing I did was turn off the camera. We don’t need to be watched.

Awesome speakers. This sits on the counter in our kitchen and has great sound quality through the kitchen and living room. The only complaint I have is that it doesn’t have a cover for the camera lens. We have the smaller one in our bedroom and it has a little switch you can hit that flips a cover over the camera lens. Why wouldn't they put that on this one too?,4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
I bought two. One for me and another  for my mom who lives in Missouri. What can’t you do with this device? It works perfectly with Ring and my XM subscription!

You can’t view your Netflix or Hulu movies or shows but you can manage your accounts. It’s pretty useless; just a fun toy. I don’t really recommend it.

It won't connect to my ring doorbell and I called Amazon about it and he had no clue so he called the ring company. Well she and I tried everything and she said i have to call Amazon. At that point I am done.

"Poor all around, bad video, bad sound. Maybe it is defective. Going in The box and going back. Sound has become a bigger issue - there is no sound, no music, just the annoying alexa voice. So speakers work, just can’t play music or videos or ... a well made product",1,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I like the Echo so much! Just ask for music and you’ve got it!! It is big enough to use in the kitchen to follow recipes, watch movies and view pics. I like the ability to close the camera shutter and to turn off the mic when I want to. I play games with Alexa too.  You can also ask Alexa what was the last thing recorded and erase it!  I asked Santa for the smaller echo and a smart plug for Xmas!  So far I’m very pleased😃",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,1
"A lot more fun than the dot. Screen rolls with interesting tidbits from current news to music suggestions to recipes to just about anything.

However, 1) that's very hard to do and 2) It WILL NOT allow you to stop the continuous onslaught of ""Try... blah blah"" at the bottom of the screen.  I hate seeing those and I hate that their appearance (a movement) attracts my attention from whatever else I was doing. Similarly, the screen cycles through formats and photos pretty quickly and abruptly, again using motion to capture my attention.

This Echo Show is just what we needed for our family room.  We had the 5 and it felt just a bit too small for our large room (but it is perfect now in our kitchen!) and so we got the 8.  Love it!

I highly recommend this seller and this product,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"This was the best gift I could give my 79 year old mom. She doesn’t have to remember pushing buttons or settings. She can  ask random questions, the weather, set reminders as often as she likes. Even jokes. She plays music and makes calls! I like it for the drop in feature I have set to view her chair and I can check on her regularly in the day.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
I believe 8 inch screen is just right for being in the kitchen.The sound quality is very good with surprising deep bass. Screen is not bad either.,3,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
Spent a day using it and it's not worth the price. Screen only turns off when you ask Alexa and the screen temp were my biggest issue. The speaker is good but the premium you pay for the screen and stripped down tablet with little functionality isn't worth it. The better value alternative would be to just get the Dot and buy a Fire tablet or similar.,2,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"It is too bad that Amazon would ruin an okay product by making it impossible to stop the stupid ""Try"" suggestions on the home screen.  ""Try:  How do I make meatballs?

"GARBAGE. This is a brilliant piece of hardware but the UI/UX is mailed in. I thought amazon had some of the best software engineers?I bought this to use in the kitchen to view recipes and listen to Spotify. Well you can do each, but not at the same time.",1,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
I was impressed with the sharpness of the screen and being able to integrate this unit with the other units I own.  The sound is very good but not as good as the 10.1 inch unit which I also own.  Amazon has done a great job in creating a system that is fully integrated and works together with other units flawlessly.  I would highly recommend purchasing this and other units sold byAmazon.,5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Just like all of the Alexa units throughout our house, this Show 8 set up fast and is flawless. So far we love it in our Kitchen. The screen looks great and the sound is impressive. Love the integration with Ring alarm system and doorbell camera. It is genius to turn all of the units in the house into glass break and alarm sensors when connected to the Ring alarm system.  Great job Amazon!",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"Using my photographs as a slideshow background is frustrating, as many of my pictures do not fill the screen.  The Echo Show then divides the screen into three parts, showing the photo in the middle section, and trying to triple the picture.

"I had never had an Echo Show. I am not real happy with other Echo Devices, but this one is pretty cool. I would definitely repurchase this item again. I love all the options it gives you.

Keep it up!!",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0

I have other Echos that aren't the Echo Show and they are fine. Bummed.",2,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"This works great, but I have the same problem with it as I had with the Kindle I bought, not enough instruction on how to set it up for some applications.  For instance; making the Echo show communicate with another Echo show device.  I looked up apps that are supposed to make that happen and I found probably 20 apps, with no real indication of which one I need.  The one I picked didn't work and I got frustrated after an hours and gave up.  When I have time I'll try again, but some instruction would have made this a much better experience.",4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"It does what it is designed to do. My kids enjoy playing amazon music, and with some songs the words scroll on the screen and they sing along.

"I went into set-up and disabled practically everything, but I still get the 'say Alexa...blah blah blah.'  If there is a way to disable this it is not intuitive, so  I don't really care if I could follow 1 dozen steps to do this.  Just an ad for Alexa with some nice pictures in the background.  All the useful things it does can be done with the original unit.",2,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
I just spent an hour on the phone with a rep that told me the only option was drop in and that you could not call another echo device. I thought that was stupid to allow other free access to your device. Once off I tried to just call and it works and they have to answer. I asked the rep specifically if you had an option to answer and was told no.,5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I have owned all iterations of the echo.  Amazon continues to improve the units. Near field works better, sound quality and video have also been improved.

"The Echo device is great; the ""Promotion"" and Amazon's Client Service are not. The Echo promotion advertised that one could get 25% off of a new Echo, plus be eligible for $30 rebate by trading in the old one.  I placed the order and filled out the trade-in info at the same time.  The 25% discount was not applied, and when I phoned, was told that it would be applied as a gift card after the trade-in was received.  The trade-in was accepted, but the 25% discount was not applied.  After 90 most frustrating minutes with the online chat ""assistance"", the fifth ""assistant"" told me the discount would not apply because I ordered the Echo before sending in the trade-in, despite the way the promotion was described.",1,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"We made a REALLY good decision getting the Echo Show 8! It’s a great go-to. I never have to worry about forgetting anything because Alexa will remind me, and all I have to do is tell her to remind me! The Echo Show is great for being productive and all, but it’s also great to have when you’re lounging around and want to listen to music. Alexa will also just sit and talk to you! 🤣 The only problem I have is I noticed the speakers started to muffle a little when I played music. Not sure if this was a manufacturer defect or my fault, but it is bothersome.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,1
"Looks great, but I'm not sure that the sound quality is the best. We had an echo show 5, which I liked, but I wanted to move it to another room so thought I would upgrade to the show 8 in our living room/kitchen.

Love my new eco show 8 i already have the eco dot 3 so i decided to give this one a chance and I’m glad i did love every thing about it i love that i can also use it as a digital photo frame that alone mskes it 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Love that u can watch movies on it love that it shows my ring doorbell its just a great little even more i love that u can shut the camera for privacy,5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,1
"This is our fourth Alexa device (along with 2 dots and a tap). It fits very well on my desk next to the computer monitor. It can hear the “Alexa” command from across the room.It has very good sound quality, and a crystal clear display. We are very happy with it.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"Pro's: great picture, quality sound, easy setup, fits neatly anywhere with or without the moveable base. Con's: very limited access to popular apps that stream movies or T.V., difficult to return to movies after pausing (you're better off touching the screen); Doesn't allow you to download apps like a tablet.  Overall it's a great product, but needs an evolution push, which I hope is in the works.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,1

También el audio es genial y funciona como un foto frame. Puedo hacer también llamada por Skype a teléfonos fijos y móviles y también llamada por Internet a otros dispositivos de Alexa. Lo que que si le agregaría es que se pueda ver Netflix .  Solo se pueden ver películas con Amazon Video Prime. También se puede navegar por Internet o ver videos de YouTube por web. También le agraria el poder instalar esa app de YouTube. En fin el producto es muy bueno.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I received this as a gift and had my doubts that two seniors to get it going and use it. Set up is simple as long as you know  your WiFi password.  After that Alexa walks you through it.

Echo show 8 screen keeps shutting off. I have to keep tuning it on and because of that the photo slide show is useless and when I do turn it on the photos don't change.

Just installed our ALEXA Show 8. It's good to see your family az well as listening to music etc.. The only thing that would make it better would be a wide angle lens. To view two or more people we must really squeeze together.

Good picture quality on the screen.",4,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0

I really got this as a multipurpose clock since I needed a clock for my living room. Decent speaker and hooks up to my ring doorbell easily to answer/monitor front door. I wish this had a full screen or bigger clock which was my main purpose for buying this. Hopefully that will be updated if so I would give it 5 stars. I also have a echo show 5 in my office. The smaller ones speaker isn't great but that's expected given the size. So if your looking for better speaker bigger screen definitely get the 8. Hope this helps.,4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0

I added on the music station to the service, it's $3.99 and i get commercial free music, love it.  Watch movies and i have just gotten started on it's features. Way more to come.

Super impressed with how far these little speakers have come. When cleaning we use this to play the radio vice our Bose system on the tv.  Ads ads and more ads are its only downfall.

This was a big upgrade for us from the Gen 1 Echo. So far we are loving it!  Was easy to set up and integrate with our Ring cameras which was the main reason for buying it.  Takes about three seconds to bring up the camera's witch is faster than viewing on the phone app or taking time to bring up on a computer. The sound quality is very good.

Our Echo Show was a gift.  We enjoy music and recipes.  We don't have any devices that it can control and we don't know anyone else with an Echo Show so video phone calls don't come into play.

The show will bring up recipes, but rarely one for what I want. If you DO find a recipe you like, you can save it. However, when you need it again, you will have to call up all recipes and go thru them.

Definitely worth buying. The picture is great the sound is great with wonderful and surprising bass and its heavy duty. Actually has some weight to it.

Voice recognition and command functionality are not perfect but I also understand this is a fairly young technology. I want the understanding of the system to increase so it can better it's ability to fulfill requests. Such as 'Alexa, randomize my thumbs up list on pandora.' This is something it can not due right now. The Echo products do not let you use a full app. It's more like a super simple version of an app. So again I don't like the functionality limitations and hope they change this soon.",3,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

Alexa can do small things make a grocery list, make a phone call and remembers Birthdays, anniversary, and little things I have a habit of forgetting.

I purchased two of these to companion my ring stick up camera. I have been so pleased with this product because it has become so useful when I want to know what is going on outside my home.

Alexa also randomly listens in and will randomly say the same thing "" I dont know that one."" when l I'm having conversations with others people. There are times she does not answer or will say I'm having trouble connecting and has to be unplugged.  The speaker also could be better.

It works with my Ring security system. Alexa has answered many questions for my wife and myself. However, I was very disappointed at how difficult it was to have a video phone call with our daughter. We bought her an Echo Show 5 and none of us could figure out how to use the Drop In feature. I emailed customer support and their reply was not very much help. I'm pretty good at figuring out computers and smart phones but I feel like giving up on this feature.",3,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

People complain about ads popping up, but you can easily stop those by going into setting.  All-in-all, I would say this was a fine investment!!!",4,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
I use alexa to turn all my electronics on. Before I used to crawl into bed after a long day of work and forget to turn off the light. Now I get to be lazy and have an AI do it.

"Echo Show 8 does not make good use of screen space and provides limited configuration options, especially if using it in a bedroom.  My main issue is the clock.  The time is squeezed in the top left corner in its daytime layout, and in the lower left corner during the night layout.  You can't configure and change these layouts.  In addition, the night view sets the background to an adaptive ambient lighting which you can't turn off, so you get the lighting whether or not you want it.  I have some other minor complaints (such as, calendar only has one view option), but its not worth trying articulate all of them.  With all this said, there's also many very nice and useful features.",3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0

Some simple spoken commands confuse Alexa or doesn't know how to interpret--I may be spoiled by sci-fi expectations.

I’m really happy with the functionality and I’m also happy I spent a few extra dollars for the 8. It’s been great so far but I do share the same frustration as others with the “try Alexa” commands that constantly flash along the bottom. You should be able to shut those off as those aren’t necessarily revenue drivers for amazon so I’m not sure why they are so wed to making them mandatory.  It’s the only reason this doesn’t get 5 stars from me.,4,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0

I video call my mom in NY all the time. I leave my mom messages all the time. She will announce things. Ask her what movies are playing near you, restaurants, ask her anything.  (When he is stumped she will say “hmmm, I don’t know that) you can set up routines.  When I say Alexa what’s up?  She gives me the news.  I can go on and on.

Alexa is by far less usable on this device than any other I have. Alexa regularly performs the wrong activity when given a command. Alexa does not understand the stop command on this device. The device frequently takes on a mind of its own which requires unplugging the device to make it stop. The sound quality is at best sub par.

Great purchase for my older parents. They love the voice commands and ability to video call the grandkids by just asking Alexa to dial them (grandkids asily downloaded the free Alexa app to their phones from the app store). No more fumbling through complicated phone apps which for older folks (60-70 yrs olds) can become challenging and frustrating. This was a win win.

The Echo Show 8 is the first Echo Show I have purchased. I have two echo dots that I received for free and I love how useful Alexa is to have around my house.

Displays lyrics for songs and even has Hulu integration. And probably a butt-load of stuff I haven’t explored just yet. I do wish it had more video skills like Netflix and stuff. But overall I definitely recommend this product.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0

"The show is great for watching videos, playing music, or reading recipes. However, it is definitely a downgrade in voice recognition and staying connected to other devices. It constantly needs to be told twice what to do. It will sometimes search for some things nowhere near similar to what was asked.

It has a difficulty recognizing me telling it to stop the timer when it goes off. In addition I have Arlo cameras for which there is direct integration to work with Alexa. However I find it that it takes a very long time to load at times (upwards of 2 minutes) and on occasion it doesn’t load the camera feed at all. Overall I would have to say this is a 3 star device. I also have a google home speaker which I feel works a lot more fluid and has better voice recognition.,3,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
My Echo Show 8 arrived about a month ago and has not been able to display recipes since day one. You touch on the recipe and the screen goes blank. This also happens for news and other articles that popup on the screen. tough one them and the screen goes blank. I called Amazon support and they told me this will be resolved in a future software update but could not say when. My show 8 had the latest update already. My wife and I are very dissatisfied.,2,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
I was really hoping that when I purchased this that it wasn’t going to be something you were going to be limited to do. I bought this for my lady so that she could watch shows on it but there’s is only Hulu and well we don’t use that. You can’t even add more apps. You’re stuck with the ones that aren’t built in. Very upsetting.,1,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
I traded in my Echo Show 1.  The Echo Show 8 has a bigger screen and smaller footprint.  Fits on the kitchen counter perfectly.  Alexa integration is better than ever.  We use the Echo Show 8 primarily for music and the sound fidelity is vastly improved over the previous version.  I often connect to my stereo via Bluetooth.  My old echo used to loose connectivity fairly frequently and I would have to power cycle the stereo's Bluetooth to connect again.  I have no issues with the new device.  I also had to power cycle my old unit because it would get locked up.  That too has been fixed with the Echo Show 8.  Alexa voice recognition is on point as well.  This was a great upgrade!,5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,1
Makes great for face to face calls.  Good stereo to it also.  Just wish they were not into listening in on people.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"SO glad we bought this! We use it more than we ever expected! Great on the nightstand (all-in-one alarm clock, sound machine, radio, weather/news & calendar, etc) in kitchen or living room. Pair it with Echo Dots throughout your home for intercom. Possibilities seem endless!",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0

On Monday we had a cell phone outage.  I attempted to make several calls to contacts through my Alexa and they would not connect even though I was able to see the contacts on my Alexa.  I was only able to call my daughter from my Alexa.  Not sure why it's hit or miss with this thing.,4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
I bought the show 8 because I have a show that I love. I really enjoy having the larger screen and the show 8 has much better sound. During the initial setup I was very disappointed when I realized that the show 8 dose not allow you to have a customizable clock screen. Why would Amazon not carryover this great feature from the show 5. I considered sending the show 8 back because of this shortcoming. I was looking forward to having a large analog clock on the screen of the show 8. PLEASE FIX THIS AMAZON!!!,3,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

I love that I can ask to see my front door and see who is there in seconds. So far, so good and no complaints.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0
We love it!!! The display is so clear and the speaker is amazing!! I wanted the 10 inch but I’m so happy I went with this one! It’s the middle one and I’m my personal opinion why pay more for a 2 inch bigger display? The size is perfect! I got it to display my photos and because Siri doesn’t always here me. This model has a built in camera cover and a button that disables the microphone and camera for your privacy. So that feature makes it better than the 10 inch!!!,5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
I absolutely love the Alexa stuff but echo show 5 or 8 is great. When I’m away at work I am able to call and talk to my little girl in the morning and she can see me and I can see her. I love everything that it allows me to control in my house. Just a great invention,5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
Product mgr should be fired. Constant buffering issues. Eventually loses camera's IP's. When used as advertised with Wyze cameras the best you can get is 15 min view time before it times out and toggles all its other nonsense. NOT practical as a means to view Wyze cameras. To bundle these together is fraud....Menu's are horrible they take forever to back out and return. Basically a $100 BAD JOKE....,1,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Gift from one of my kids to use for seeing each other on phone calls. First use, worked well, but had to hand hold the device to get into the camera view. Afterwards, wanted to place the device where the camera view would frame a seating area, but found there is no way, outside of a call, to turn the camera on for siting purpose. A ""Help"" inquiry answer was not relevant. Second call this Sunday resulted in no audio on both ends for three tries. Not a gadget I would buy for myself. Now have four Alexa devices, but what for?",3,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
Right out of the box it was easy to set up and connect. I opted to go with the bigger screen in this model and was not disappointed. Picture is sharp and clear and the audio quality is good.

I love the large screen and being able to select pictures that I want to scroll.,5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

The rep told me I needed to buy a Non-Amazon set of Bluetooth earbuds in order to pair with the Show 8.  Even though in the Alexa app, it states that the Buds are a wireless option.  AND, the Alexa app designates the Echo Buds as a “gadget” to work with the Echo Show.  But they WILL NOT PAIR.  And the Amazon rep confirmed that.  Literally told me to buy a non-Alexa requiring set of Bluetooth earbuds not made by Amazon.  Not cool, and a horrible design flaw in the Show 8.  Bad move, Amazon.  Buyer beware.",1,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

I don’t know what happened to this generation but it can almost NEVER hear me. I replaced an older model because my husband and I used it a LOT and figured that the newer version would be a treat.

Product is well made. Voice recognition is spot on. Two suggestions. 1 speakers sounds good. Would be nice if it had a front facing speaker for the sound to come towards you. 2 would be nice if it was capable to set up stereo sound to have another Alexa device pair with it. Sound quality is ok. But to have that wow factor. Any of those suggestions with blankets a wow factor. After all. I'm just comparing it to there othere echo devices.,5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

Main reason we bought it was for a baby monitor with our Blink cameras and to video chat with family. The set up is super fast and easy. We uploaded a bunch of pictures and it scrolls through them in the background. The screen also will go dim with just the clock showing when we turn the lights off for bed so it isn't a disturbance to either of us sleeping.My only issue is there wasn't any instructions or quick start on features or using the show so we just had to tinker with it and find out.

"Such a convenient addition to the household...I listen to whatever music I want whenever I want to, I ask Alexa to add stuff to my shopping list, ask it to convert measurements, show me recipes, play breaking news, do math calculations.....the list is endless !!",5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
The larger size is easy to see and read.  The sound quality is great.  I love that when streaming music the lyrics stream as well.The recipe finder is a terrific feature as well.  The new feature that allows the camera and microphone off is much appreciated.,5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I am now enjoying music once again. Basically an unlimited choice of songs, albums, etc. I don't have to key up a turntable or load CD's. All I have to do is ask.A wide range of information is readily available as well. I am more than happy with this device and plan to extend other options to the system.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I love mine. I use it to play music and watch recipes while cooking. It has so many features that I’m still finding new ones and I’ve had it for a few months. The only issues I’ve ever had is sometimes it doesn’t understand what I’m asking but after a few more times trying, she usually gets it. And that only happens once a week if that.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0

"Tech support needs a little more training and knowledge of their own product, when I called people were laughing babies were crying, hard to heard and understand also “There is a 50/50 change you echo show can do that” was the answer I got, after 15min wait.. It’s a wonderful product I love it!!!!!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
I have to say I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews. But honestly I think it works great and some of the other annoyances that seem to be bothersome to otters are negligible to me. Or you can make changes in the settings as other reviewers have stated.,5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"Love this device! The concept is exactly what I wanted. But the Alexa skills just aren’t made for a visual display. Was super excited about the idea of putting recipes on here but that skills is the absolute worst. With this kind of device, I’d want to be able to easily customize my screen and the order of what I see on it but I haven’t found an easy way to do that. Love the potential with this device but Amazon just doesn’t fully take advantage of the opportunities here.",3,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"This is an excellent product, the sound quality is outstanding and it's ability to integrate with many different types of media, including bluetooth capabilities sets it apart from any products in category. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for this type of product!",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
I’m so glad I went with the 8 instead of 5 because the screen is bigger. This thing is powerful in sound and the connection to my amazon account syncs smoothly. It even shows the lyrics to the song so I have no excuses for singing the wrong lyrics. I love this thing!,5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,1
"We had a Show 5 for awhile and loved it, this is even better with the larger screen, we love the whole Alexa system. Moved the 5 to the bedroom. This 8 is really great especially using our Ring doorbell and interacting with our Dish Network receiver.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Quite possibly the greatest gift I've ever gotten for my wife, she uses it in the kitchen for recipes and music and have had no problems, easily set up and very enjoyable. Price was incredible, Made the mistake of not getting the stand which I am going to order soon.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"I don’t understand why the echo show 8 doesn’t support the stick up cam battery even when it is online. What if all the previous cameras you’ve purchased are battery operated & not hard wired (which is convenient to move around for strategic reasons)??? This echo show would have been a complete failure! It does not completely serve its purpose.Other than that, the picture & sound quality I guess is okay.",3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"This is a useful device. The sound is no where close to the echo plus. Perhaps its because there is no sound that come out the front. The echo plus is a cylinder,  so sound comes out 360 degrees. Also in having a hard time turning her off. I have had to unplug the echo show many times because it did not do it on command. I thought the time would be much larger than it is.",3,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"Replaces the older model quite seamlessly. Haven't had it long enough, especially during the holidays, to try all the features. But ""she"" has answered all questions and played music well.  Haven't had a chance to watch videos yet, but I'll get to it.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
I like a lot of the things Echo 8 can do.  I really like how the music sounds rich and really loud.  I  like that the lyrics  to the songs is written on the screen.  I still have a lot of things that I want to check out.  So far I really do  like it.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
I received one as a gift. It is ok I was a going to use it as alarm clock but I have to shout to get it to shut off. Watching videos is simple but some times it has problems finding a video. Basically it seems to have software similar to a smartwatch.,4,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
Good size for a kitchen top or desktop without having too notceable footprint.Microphonee appears not be able to pickup  commands across the room well.  Speaker not as powerful as Echo Show 2. Screen size between Echo Show 2 and Echo show 5 is just right.,4,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
I didn't own a Echo Show before this so I was unsure how we would integrate this into our lives.  Looks great on our kitchen counter and we use it more than I thought we would. To say the least we love it and enjoy learning how to get the most out of it.,5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Music sounds great with this Alexa, very good range across the frequencies.  Setup was very easy and intuitive, most of the setup was already done from my account information.  Picture quality is excellent, I have watched a few movies, recipes, and even my ring doorbell.  Overall This is just the right size for the kitchen of bedroom.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
My family and I have several of the Alexa products and we really enjoy all of them. I have enjoyed having the Show. I have purchased the Ring doorbell to be installed to work along with the Show. I look forward to using all the products together.,5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
I was a little iffy. I'm buying it since we had the old 10-inch. I like it so much more. I want these devices. However. I don't know Alexa isn't the smartest. You tell it one thing. I don't think you said something completely different. She says I don't know. I'm half the stuff. It's great for little things and sometimes turning on and off the light. But they really do need to work on just the Amazon Alexa feet. Sure. But the device is pretty good.,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"Overall, it is an absolutely amazing product. The video quality and color are great. There are so many options available to enhance the viability of the Echo Show 8. It is easy to set up and connect using the intuitive screen display. The built-in Silk browser is very handy. Great product",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,1
I love that you can make phone calls on this and you can watch movies if you wanted to on Amazon prime. I cannot watch movies on Netflix on it though but maybe on another version that will be available. I love that I can see my photos display on the echo show.,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"Overall I am happy with the Show 5, but really annoyed by the pricing. I ordered it the week before Black Friday on a special pre-release offer. Then on Black Friday it was $20 cheaper. But it gets worse! Now it is another $20 cheaper meaning it is 40% off what I paid as a ""pre-release"" customer. NOT HAPPY AMAZON!One tip - You can use the Show as a sort of home security camera using ""drop in"". However, without the optional tilt base you will pretty much be staring at the ceiling with very little view of the room.",4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"Love this new addition to my house!  It first came cracked but amazon did its thing and sent me a new one! I love having it around the house!  I will pull up music, recipes, tell you the weather, and much more!  I will be buying another one for my parents!",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"The best screen yet, I just wish it were larger.I highly recommend the optional base. It not only adds some needed height but allows you to tip the screen down just a bit which I feel was required.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
Highly recommend. We had an Echo before we got the Show. The regular echo is really helpful but the Show is so much better. I feel like we get a lot more use out of it. I love the fact that we can display any of our security cameras on the screen.,5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"The microphone does not work. I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She does not use technology and had to wait for me to help her set it up over the phone. I got her an echo dot also. She did not understand that the View was supposed to respond to voice commands, just like the dot. I was able to go to her house this week and tried out the View, which does not respond to voice commands. I looked for help online, restarted it, reset it to factory commands. It just does not work! When I got home, I looked up my order and saw that the return was only good until January 31st. That was a crappy Christmas gift.",1,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
It's handy to use and easy to use.  I can access my home security cameras easily and it also reports any sounds or movements detected in my home.  Also great for so many other functions that it's an amazing tool and enjoyable asset for the home.,5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"I used this product to be able to like to my other smart devices. I like that I can set it in my kitchen & ask Alexa to look up a recipe. You can ask just about anything. Some things Alexa did not understand. The time is displayed large which is great. You can set alarms, reminders, add things to a shopping list... Overall this is a great device & I love it.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"The best Echo device I've own. The screen is clear. Speaker is loud and clear. I love everything about it. It does everything my Echo and Echo Dot do plus more. Thanks for the big 8"" touch screen. It's a lot easier to configure since. You can config all on the device instead of using the Amazon Alexa app.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,1
"Incredible sound and picture. We can watch our favorite shows and listen to our music in high quality from any room where we have these devices. We have a 5 inch in every bedroom, and the larger ones in the common areas such as living room and kitchen. Highly recommended.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"The video and sound quality are stunning! This is the third Echo Show for our home but the other two are Echo Show 5s; the 5 is a great product but the difference between the 5 and 8 is shocking. This  Echo Show 8 rivals our very expensive 4K UHD TV! I am thoroughly impressed. Well done, Amazon. Keep them coming.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,1
The Echo Show can do everything the Echo Dot can do plus some. I like the fact that it connects with my Ring door bell and will show who is at the door and I can speak to the person as well. I like that it shows all the Amazon Prime movies and you can play games on it like 'Deal or No Deal' or 'Jeopardy'.,5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I highly recommend if you have a loved one in an assisted living.  After 3 months of not being about to see our sister in person, a neighbor recommended the Echo Show.  Our sister has gone from deep depression to dressing each day and calling us when she wants.  We can check in on her care, visit with medical staff while she is there with them and chat.  It has made a great difference in her mood and has given us a peace of mind during this crazy time of COVID.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"This was a gift from my son. I enjoy technology and also own an Echo and Echo Dot. All great devices. I use the Show for entertainment mostly. I have also made video calls with it, checked my calendar, looked at photos, listen to music on Sirius FM and other Amazon Music, checked out movies on Prime, asked various questions, search and look at recipes, and tested out the vast array of skills. I'm sure I will be utilizing this device for a long time. It is now part of the living room.",4,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"Perfect for everyone. My 2 year old has a new best friend. We can drop in on the device from the cell phone and communicate, listen to music, she like you tube. Better than a nursery monitor. Getting one for every room. All u need is wi-fi no monthly payments",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"Originally ordered the Show 5. It met my expectations except the sound. I decided to keep the 5 for a smaller room, but ordered the Show 8 for the kitchen and Bam!... room filling sound as anticipated. The larger screen helps me to read recipes across the room. I went all in on the Alexa ecosystem this Christmas. Yeah... Amazon probably knows everything about me now... but they probably already did.... they certainly know my buying habits. The services they offer is and the associated devices are a bargain. I’m a fan. Keeping bringing me value, and I’ll be a fan for life.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

"I owned an old Echo (the first release) and Echo Dot, and I'm very happy with both of them. I thought that adding video would make it more interesting. The visuals associated with my requests are really useful, whether it's the weather forecast, the lyrics of the songs on Amazon Music, or the video feed from my Ring doorbell. The fact that the new Echo is bilingual is also a great feature.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"My family and I were initially very excited to get this device. It was a little irritating to see the occasional advertisement for a skill pop up over our photos, but we could love with that. Unfortunately the advertisements got worse over time and now take over entire screen. One out of every five screens is a phot, the rest are advertisements.  Getting to the point where we will be getting rid of it and going back to the old speaker only device.",1,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"This is not only an Alexa, it scrolls through your pictures as a photo device.  The time displays which serves as a clock.  Great to have option to ask to see option to ask to see visuals of questions you ask.  Speakers are great...we play music all the time",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I live for these devices. Have them all over the house. However, I have to repeat myself constantly and it's a bit embarrassing when I have guests. It kind of becomes the joke when people visit. They speak to alexa to see what she understands or comes up with.",4,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0

I love how can watch cooking videos and get recipes and hear the news is pretty good. The only thing I don't like is when you put it on night mode you can still see a little background light.  And also when you try to tell her to turn the brightness down you have to get up and do it manually,5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,1
Alexa is very good at recognizing my words and so far no misfires.  Even my wife has now become used to asking for help with the weather or recipes and the integration into Ring has worked very well which was the initial reason I wanted to install this,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

L-O-V-E it!! Does so much for so little money. A touch screen controller with that quality is in the thousands of dollars in the pro market. Works as a digital picture frame as well and does so much more. I can even see my ring cameras by just asking Alexa.,5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
The main complaint I have about Alexa is that this technology doesn't seem to know as much as Google. There have been several questions I have asked that she wasn't able to answer. I really enjoy the digital photo album feature and seeing old photos.,4,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
Alexa knows our voices on this device but is sometimes unable to identify us. Music sounds great but your voice through it doesnt sound clear to the person you are speaking to. Alexa misunderstands what we say on this device yet understands us well on other devices. Packaging was poor. The item was free to bounce around in the bigger shipping box with minimal scant bubbles inside box and the shipping box was fairly torn up on arrival.,3,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"For 80 bucks, fine. Audio is OK, bassy and fun, if not a bit boomy and soft on treble. Voice recognition is only OK, doesn't like my Mom. Alexa is a league behind Google Assistant in answering general questions. For the $80 I paid for these, pretty OK.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
I love my echo show 8!!! It keeps me entertained while cooking or doing dishes. I have it connected to my Ring. Com and I can see what’s going on all around my house!  I love that she will make calls for me at my command. I think this is a great concept!!!,5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0

"I bought this despite reservations expressed by others about the clock size and the ""Try this"" feature that appears across the bottom.  But the review by viperamd64 convinced me that the shortcomings could be overcome by properly setting up the device.  The sequence viper suggests doesn't exist.  You cannot go to Home & Clock. From settings you go directly to Home Content.  And making the suggested changes to Discovery and Rotate Continuously did not make the clock bigger nor stop the ""Try this"" messages.  I will keep tinkering, but I hope Amazon will update the software to fix these problems with an otherwise excellent device.",4,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"Echo Show is wonderful on so many levels. It provides all kinds of information and entertainment, choices of what you can do, and just a friendly voice always there when you need it. For those of us who don't often speak to anyone, Alexa seems like a friend.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"Does what I was expecting. Only disappointment was the lack of clock faces and style and the small clock, no full screen. I don't want photos on the screen just a standard display when not in use. The clock or clock and date in a large font would have been wonderful.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
I mainly bought this to integrate Ring-door bell so I can see Vedic when someone hits the bell before I open the door. It tries to connect to ring and just goes to home screen without displaying any video. I like Alexa dot a lot which does everything for $29.,3,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
"The resolution is pretty good, but the sound is not that great. It also feels a little slow and It freezes from time to time.

First the device is awesome and I love it that said I used the trade in option for 2 older Echo shows and one cylinder style echo. They were all in working condition without any damage . They said they would give you (up to 30.00 off) well I did the process getting 30.00 off and then was billed 25.00 each because they only credited 5.00 for each device. If I knew Amazon would do this I never would have sent them back and instead just used them in different areas of the house really disappointed in the “trade in” process.,4,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
I received this as a present. I really enjoy the visuals and especially appreciate the ability to have easy visual access to recipies.I also think the speakers are better and enjoy integrating it with my other echos for whole house music.,4,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

I am so disappointed.",3,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"Plugged it in and it pretty much set itself up. Got it mostly to link with my Ring Video doorbell, so that my wife doesn't have to call up the app each time to see who's at the door, and it works great. Nice speakers for a non-detacated sound system. Glad I got it.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

"Decent product, but in two months it has had issues where we have to unplug it so it resets.  It also disconnects from WiFi occasionally.

"I WANTED A LARGE CLOCK FACE (with a nice choice of backgrounds) showing day of the week, date and temperature. NOT POSSIBLE, which is utterly amazing, since that is what is available on my Echo Show 5.I've already sent it back!",1,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"I had the first ten, and it was OK, but too bulky. The Show 8 is perfect for my desk top with better sound, better picture and ab available rotating/tilting base. The camera/mic can be easily turned off when desired. I am extremely pleased!",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"As mentioned the set up using the screen was very straight forward and easy. Two things we still need to investigate is how to get all the Echo's to play the same music at the same time, and to use the new echo as an intercom as we had before.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
The larger screen makes this a good choice except for not having clock face options that allow for a full screen clock. What is worse is that the picture on Amazon indicates one is able to have a full size clock. I am not sure what the point is of having a larger screen but a smaller clock. Amazon will hopefully offer a download for a variety of clock faces for the Echo Eight. Until they do I encourage you to buy the Echo Five if clock size is of importance,3,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
We love our show that we have in our bedroom and we have an Echo Show in our living room so that should say that they're great products. You can link your ring to Alexa and that is a great feature. I promised if you buy it you will not be disappointed.,5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"This is an excellent upgrade to the original Echo Show. The aesthetic changes allow it to blend easily into the background when not in use. I love that I can mute the mic AND close off the camera - the added privacy option is an appreciated touch. The integration of the speaker means the focus when you are video chatting is on the people on the screen, not the giant speaker. I do wish the stand was hight adjustable in addition to having tilt and swivel; right now, I'm using an old paperback to set it a bit higher when video chatting with friends and family. Other than that suggestion, this is an excellent device.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Great product but ads make it unusable. I got this device so I could upload photos and have them rotate on screen. I see more ads than pictures. Yes, I know there’s setting to turn them off but it doesn’t work!!! The ads still show up. I don’t like sleazy stuff like this. Make it easier to turn them off. Why are there ads at all? Never buying another one of these again. Just sell to your advertisers since you seem to love them so much. It’s better to get an echo speaker to control your smart devices and you won’t get ads. Amazon keeps losing my trust everyday. You can’t treat your workers or your customers right.",1,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

I have been using the unit for about a month now and it works as expected.  Set up was very simple and picked up all of my existing devices.  I like the feature of seeing my Ring doorbells.  I use this as a bedside clock and so much more.  Very happy with the purchase.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

"It's a great addition to the Echo line.  I love watching my stored pictures pop up throughout the day.  I would appreciate some control over the frequency of the picture changes.  The settings are easy to change but slow to act.  All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
With the current pandemic we needed a way to see our grandmother who didn’t have FaceTime capabilities.  We set this up for her and she now loves it. Easy to use for those not computer/tech savvy. Even the setup was manageable for them.  Bought the stand to go with it.,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0

I like it for using Amazon music and a few other things. but at this point I don't consider it a primary item that's totally useful for depending on doing daily tasks, it's just handy and helpful at times, at this time in my life. I does not respond to my asking questions the same, from time to time, For instance, I can ask it to repeat a song, and it won't, but the next day I can ask the same question, and it will understand and repeat the song like I asked. ( as per example).",3,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
We got this as a gift for a family member who lives far away. We set it up so that I can add photos to our amazon photos shared album and then they show up on her screen!

I made this purchase to replace my 1st generation Echo Show with smaller screen.  The sound is great.

Replaced my Echo 5 with this.  Besides the screen size the biggest difference is better sound quality on its own; For some reason when I blueooth connect this to my tv sound bar it requires a bluetooth connect each time i use my soundbar for my tv and then try to use it later for my show 8.,4,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0

I purchased this BRAND NEW echo show 8 a week before christmas and it came in time. I needed this for my gender reveal to show pictures on a slideshow and play music. It worked perfectly for one day then  alexa just stopped responding. I called amazon customer service on was on the phone for hours with troubleshooting options and went through all of them. They decided it was not functioning right and sent me a RECONDITIONED one when i payed for a BRAND NEW one. Thank you amazon for ruining my christmas and gender reveal........

Sound is Ok, getting Alexa to manage my house is....  also, why can I use amazon on my IPhone but Alexa pretends apple does not exist in her universe.

So far, it just makes a half decent alarm clock and a good speaker. Otherwise more hype than anything.",3,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"One of the things I love about the Echo Show 5 is the ability to display a full clock.  This is not an option with Show 8.  In order to continually display the clock, you need to set up the Do Not Disturb, which will show the clock and turn off the Things to Try.  When playing prime video's, the picture is clear and the sound is good.  Overall, if I had purchased the Echo 8 first instead of the Echo 5, the shortcomings wouldn't have been as obvious.  In all honesty, I prefer the Echo 5, even though it doesn't show video, which is something I usually do on an IPad or TV.",3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
I have this in my kitchen and love it.  Get to visit with my grandchildren through video.  One problem is in the contacts.  A phone number that I am trying to delete and it will not let me.

"I had high hopes for my Echo Show. Love my Echo Dot. But the Show has a very clunky design & takes up more counter space than I expected.  Voice recognition works pretty well.

Wow if I realized the echo show 8 was going to be like a iPad on my kitchen island I would have gotten it sooner.  It’s beautifully large for seeing recipes and reading mail.  Just love it.  Glad I added it to my collection of Alexa products,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
I love the echo show and the blink camera.  The reason I have it a 4 star is because the camera only stay on for like a minute.  I got it because I wanted to constantly see what was happening with having the press continue or the camera just stop showing me on my phone or the echo.  I really wish they would make it so the camera can stay on your phone until you decide to stop it.,4,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

If you’re lucky and it gets your command, will probably get it wrong and you’ll have to repeat it several times which is even more frustrating.

The Echo show 8 has been a great addition to our device family. The screen size is fantastic. We can easily read the weather from a good distance away. The alexa integration is as good or better than what we've come to expect from the echo devices. The only problem I have with the Echo Show 8 is the sound quality. We bought a Echo Show 5 and I was very impressed with the sound quality but the screen size wasn't big enough for what we were going to use it for. I was disappointed that the Echo Show 8 does not sound as good as the 5. If you're just using it for a smart screen then you can't go wrong but if you want sound quality try a 5.,4,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0

This device is like having a friend in the room.  Many great songs to choose from.  BUT my favorite feature is the call my phone .  I lost my cell phone in the house.  All I had to say was Alexa call my phone and it rings my phone .. I found it in the laundry basket under some clothes.  It really is all the hype and worth the money.  If your on the couch and don’t want to get up just tell Alexa to call your kids she does it for you and you can remind them to drive safe or whatever .  It’s really great,5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
Great device but lack of video content is a bummer. No Netflix or other Prime Video competitors - just Hulu (Ugh!). Also suffers from very bassy audio - like most Echo devices. The equalizer just can't reduce this enough.,4,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0

One thing that should be improved is the time sequence for the slide show the fastest speed is 2 minutes which is slower than the time sequence that is used for the built in  Travel Show that comes with the unit. I also added my smart light plugs which comes in handy. I was impressed with the sound quality of the unit.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
Love the look of it. I did get the stand and it makes it look so much nicer. It’s great overall. But when alexa starts talking or ur listening to music you start to hear the speaker really raspy and thats on half the full volume. The hulu app: it doesn't let you pick from ur own profile and doesn't let you pick episodes. It helps to tell alexa “play so and so season 2 episode 3”. Not to many  video apps. But it has everything else the echo dot does just with a screen.,4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0

"Bought this to interface with my Arlo Pro 3 system. I was surprised at the ease of setup, and the video quality.Also surprised at the quality and volume of the audio. My 5 year old grandson is in love with it, lol, he's playing",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"We upgraded from the 5 so we could have video calls and see our new grandson. I'm glad we did, the picture size is good without dominating the living room. The 5 is now on the night stand and really make for the ultimate alarm clock!",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"My first one didn't work so they sent me another one. I love listening to music on it. Sometimes it doesn't listen to me so I guess I need to set up voice recognition. I like having the screen so you can see the words to the songs. I hope to set it up to talk to people on it. Love that we can take it out on our deck and listen to all kinds of music, so much better than radio.",4,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
Positives: I liked how it easily integrated with my Phillips hue hub and lights. Video quality for face to face calls is really good.Negatives: The main thing I have this for is to be able to face to face chat with family members and this device falls flat in that capacity. Either the other end can't hear me or I can't hear the other end. It not the device network either.,3,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

I added my Echo Show 8 to my home and I'm very satisfied. Being only used to listening to Alexa on the echo dot the screen on my show has made it even better!

"I love the product, but there are two things I don't like. 1. Let's get rid of try Alexa. So annoying. I already get emails on this subject. 2. This needs an option so screen stays lite in low light. Placed in Theater Room. Have to yell Alexa to see clock. Distraction for others.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
i have been having a great time with this device.  I have uploaded an album of pictures that scroll through as a slide show and I can make video calls.  It took a little while to figure out how to set it up.  I wish I could control the slide show more.,5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

"Echo Show 8 was easy to set up.  I've only had this for a short time so I'm still finding out all it can do.  The only disappointment so far is that I can not change the ""call name"" to whatever I want. A family member's name is Alexa so this can get it confused. Right now there are only limited things I can change it to like ""computer"" etc. Other than that we are enjoying it thoroughly.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0

"This smaller model of Echo Show is a convenient tool in the bedroom.  Not only showing the time, you get a weather report, music, a front door view and more without leaving your bed.

The video display is quite good.",4,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

I hope that Amazon is working to somehow adjust the Echo Show 8's microphone sensitivity, it really needs it!",3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0

"I got this as a gift. Never would have thought of purchasing one. Now im so glad I have it! Has lots of on-demand features like music, weather, and news. I would say Alexa falls a little short on AI quality. If Alexa has to read something from the internet due to lack of internal knowledge, she reads only what she can display on screen. Voice recognition fails more than I would expect. Im excited to try out the integration with RING camera so I can finally see when someone pulls into the driveway.",4,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0

I would rate it higher but I hate that annoying suggestion at the bottom of the screen. I read that there is no way to get rid of it but someone said to just put a strip of black tape over it so I may try that. Sad that you have to diminish the screen size like that.

After the second unit still having issues with the sound quality.  After a day or so unit sounds like someone talking from the bottom of a well.  Little to no Bass.

Bought this primarily to stream Sirius XM while paired with an older Bose Soundlink Mini. Pairs fine. Problem is the app sucks. All it shows is the Sirius XM logo and the channel.

Alexa seems to prefer accessing Amazon music however we have tried and failed to access Spotify for specific music. That is a problem for us since we have a Spotify account and we have music on that site. Alexa has difficulty accessing Apple podcast specific episodes.

I did some research and apparently this happens often enough that I am stunned that Amazon hasn't fixed the problem.",4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0

I bought the echo show because my daughter said I would be able to use it to talk and see my grandkids like we do on FaceTime. That was not the case my fault I should have researched further.

"I bought this expecting that echo show and ring doorbell will seamlessly work together but echo show doesn't show the video when ring doorbell is pressed, it just announce some at door and even that also is random, sometime works sometimes not. It looks to me as a half baked product.Don't recommend.",2,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
This was easy to set up and integrate with my echo dots.  The picture quality and sound are excellent.  Voice recognition is very good but occasionally you do have to repeat yourself.  I like the fact it has a built in slide to cover the camera versus having to put a piece of tape over to protect privacy.,5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"I have owned 3 of these, starting with the original. This is BY FAR the worst.  It doesnt respond to its wakeup word.  It does things I dont instruct it to do, constantly not understanding basic directions. Very unhappy, and probably done with this now that my Ring system makes it not needed.  Stay away from this.  If you already have Alexa and are happy with it, skip this versiom and wait for the 9 version, or the 10 version.  But the 8 version is terrible.  Just terrible.",1,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
I really liked this device. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I wish I would put a timer for the background pictures. Sometimes they stop for a long time and then others it doesn't even change at all. Also wish that it would just open up YouTube rather than having to open up a web browser.,4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

"I had several echo 3s first.  Very happy with them.  Then on black Friday I ordered at echo show 9.  I really like it.  Great to have the echo with visual and touch screen.

Its great for recipes.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

If I would have known I would have never bought it.,3,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

The Echo Show 8 is a great way to catch up with my sister that I'm not able to see as often as I'd like.  I bought one for each of us this past Black Friday and now just love the chance to see her when I talk to her!  I was intrigued by the 'burned duck' commercial and the young woman's ability to connect with her father via video so when I saw the items on sale I figured it was the right time to buy the two of them.,5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0

Seeing the screen reminds me that I have Alexa right there to answer questions -- I would forget to use her when I just had the dot. I would prefer that there were speakers in the front though.

Voice recognition is still a challenge. Overall I recommend this as the 5 is small n works best as alarm clock substitute as opposed to a tv alternative as well as smart home controller.

I purchased this product over the speaker because it was advertised as being able to ask Alexa to display ""the front door camera.""

Product is ok.  Not what I expected.  Good luck trying to return.  I had to call customer service to request a UPS pickup.  They processed the labels twice now and they didn’t have enough common sense to use my residential address.  They keep sending UPS to my p.o. box.  Seriously give the staff some training.,3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
Found that this was obviously much louder than the echo 5 and the screen is better. So if you are a light to decent sleeper you may not need this. Only issue I have is that they took out the alarm clock visually on the home screen that is on the echo 5. So a smaller space or room go with the 5. Larger space the 8 is a must-have.,4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

Sound is amazing. Alexa use is great. Having said that more apps and more control for existing apps would be fantastic. The show feels like a small version of the Cube.

"I love the concept and product features but in reality the device just doesn't work.  The most common phrases Alexa says are ""I'm having trouble connecting"" or ""something went wrong"".

Every other device in my house is online and working and Alexa struggles more often than she works.",1,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
