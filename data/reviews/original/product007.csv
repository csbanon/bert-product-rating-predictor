I really like the new Fire TV Stick 4K.  I has more memory than the previous one and has an TV off to turn my TV off.  It also has an all-new Alexa Voice Remote.  It seems to download faster than the old one.,5,1,2018-11-12,1,1,1
"I received this 4K Stick on Nov. 26. After installing and start streaming noticed that picture is not really bright. Messing with TV settings would not do any significant changes. Went to stick settings and changed ""Always HDR"" to ""Adaptive HDR"", well, brightness improved, but picture became bad, like playing VCR tapes on UHD TV.Anyway, called tech support and went through all motion and nothing helped. Ordered replacement, just to make sure its not isolated problem, but very skeptical it would help. Support emailed me that problem reported to Developers for investigation, but from what I know it usually comes back as ""problem with customer's TV"".",1,1,2018-12-1,1,1,0
"Update to my review, when I posted my original review see below, Amazon called me within 5 minutes.  Very helpful customer service person.  We tried a process on the device.  It fixed the AV sync issue.  I told the person if this stayed stable I would revise my review.  Sadly I do have to revise my review and say the process they had me do is not a permanent fix it would seem  Each time I use the Firestick it is out of sync again.  I even use my receivers sync option, I can get things synced but the next time I use the Firestick I have to either increase or decrease the sync time.  When I use my previous 4K Fire product ""not a Firestick, the flat square unit / the last generation I believe""  Everytime I use it sound is in sync no issues.  I admit the newer Firestick is faster and a bit better picture. I bought it for the DV option.  But having to manually adjust sound each time I watch a movie or other source through it is not worth the effort. Returning the unit.Original review:",1,1,2018-11-17,1,8,0
"**UPDATE**Changed from a 3 to a 4 star. Amazon reached out to me about the issue I was having with my fire stick hdmi cable and exchanged my fire stick for a new one. No problems with the new one so far. I'm glad they replaced the whole product because my remote started turning the TV on and off, I had to remove the batteries for it to stop. it happened twice I'm unsure the reason why. But the new set up I got hasn't had any problems.",4,1,2018-11-5,1,8,0
"Update: I had to move the fire stick to the living room so that it would be directly by the WiFi box in order for it to work. I had to move the Roku back to my bedroom (where the fire stick initially was) and that still works with ZERO buffering issues. Now, suddenly a month to so later, every single time I try to use the fire stick I get a message on the screen that says, “Home is Currently Unavailable. We are unable to connect to Amazon services. Please check your internet connection or try again later”. I then click the “go to network settings link” and it shows that I am connected and that the signal is great. Yet, I still can’t use the freaking fire stick. It has been 4 days and it still keeps saying that it cannot connect. Even though our phones, tablets, TVs, laptops, DVD players, Xboxes, and PlayStations are connecting fine, I rebooted the WiFi. I’ve tried disconnecting and reconnecting the fire stick to the WiFi. I’ve tried everything. I have always been a roku owner. I finally decided to give the fire stick a try and I regret it. I like the setup of the fire stick, but it’s pointless when I can’t even use it. I’d give it zero stars if I had the option to do so. I’m sending it back.",1,1,2018-11-28,1,8,1
"UPDATE:  I lowered the rating to two stars because it appears the only content available on Amazon Prime with Dolby Atmos audio is the Tom Clancy series, ""Jack Ryan"".  We were hoping to stop buying 4K Blu-ray disks and start streaming UHD HDR movies with Dolby Atmos through the new Fire Stick 4K.  We were surprised and disappointed when we purchased the online/streaming version of ""The Incredibles 2"", it only had Dolby 5.1 audio available..!I was even more disappointed after searching through the Netflix App, none of their 4K or Dolby Vision movies/shows were available with Dolby Atmos audio though the new Fire Stick 4K either.",2,1,2018-11-5,1,8,0
"I really like it, picture quality is great & there are lots of shows to watch on it. I was under the impression I would be able to watch all the shows for free though, that is not true. There are lots of movies you have to pay for to watch but it was still a good buy",5,1,2018-11-13,1,8,0
"We have a Sharp Roku TV that is two years old. The performance is a bit slow opening Playstation Vue and Tablo.  We tried DirectTV Now and it was unwatchable.  The menu was so slow changing channels that I cancelled the service (even though it was on promo for $10 a month).I saw that the Roku 4K stick's remote now had power, volume, and mute. Since it's a bedroom TV, sleep timer was essential. I read the sleep timer would be added later this year. The convenience of that is we would no longer have to use the Roku TV remote once I set the TV to automatically turn on to the Fire TV Stick.  My main concern was performance.  If this stick could push 4K with it's faster processor, then it will be great for 1080p.",5,1,2018-11-8,1,6,0

"Update to review below:After leaving my review, I received a phone call from a gentleman by the name of Steve. He reassured me that he would pass along my frustrations to Hallmark and see if anything can be done.",4,1,2018-11-14,1,6,0
The Fire TV Stick 4K works great. The most common problems people experience are:1. HDMI Extender (Included) - Use this because it is also an antenna and helps with Wi-Fi reception. Wi-Fi 2G is stronger and 5G is faster. If you are having Wi-Fi problems use 2G.,4,1,2018-11-6,1,2,0
"Prime Video works fine with this device, but Netflix is sub-par compared to Apple TV 4K.Netflix decides what format to select based on the audio/video capabilities of the player. It will only play 4K/UHD through this device if the 4K Firestick is plugged into an HDMI port that supports 4K at 50/60 Hz. On my TV, a 2015 Vizio M-55C2, there is only one such HDMI port, HDMI 5. This port won't upscale from below 720p, so my SD content and devices are unplayable on my TV without moving the HDMI cable to port 1 or 2. Apple TV 4K is happy with 4K at 30Hz, so no cable moving needed.",2,1,2018-11-5,1,2,0
"Reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 , cause few tiny details. Mirroring is not working on new device, its just not available like on previous model. Also remote control slightly lugging .Other way new device is Great. Very smooth operation, easy install and setup, Crystal clear view. Just hope Amazon Team include Mirroring with new software update.",4,1,2018-11-5,1,1,0
"Three in a row now that have had various problems (pendant fire tv, fire cube, fire stick 4k).  Not sure why I keep trying new ones.  Still hoping Amazon will come through.The good about this is adding the dolby vision throughout including in menus is a very big picture improvement.  Even non-4k apps like playstation vue which normally don't look all that great get a huge visual improvement with this stick.  In addition it's finally nice to have a remote that controls the tv and volume.  They also did a good job of improving the speed which was a huge blunder on the fire cube.  For those reasons we are keeping this one instead of sending back.",1,1,2018-11-6,1,1,0
I really like this new device as it packs a lot of power at a great price.The new remote control is very handy as well. No more searching for the TV remote to adjust the volume or turn off power. The only thing I expected to have more memory not just 8GB other than that it's a great device I recommend it,5,1,2018-11-6,1,1,0
If you get this new Fire Stick forget cable. I love this new Fire Stick. I need one for each room. It has more features and stations that are free and come with the First Stick.,5,1,2018-11-5,1,1,0
"So you’ve heard about cutting the cord and you’re excited to save a little money, or you remember when you could stream just about any movie on Netflix, and you think a Fire TV Stick is the answer. The Amazon Fire TV Stick isn’t very expensive, but if you don’t wish to deal with the stress or disappointment, do your research first.After getting sick of paying for a whole cable subscription to watch nothing but local news, I installed a $600 antenna, only to find out the only channels available over the air in my area are PBS. After hearing about the Fire TV Stick, I thought I had found the answer. I was wrong.",1,1,2018-12-8,1,5,0
"This is my first time with a fire tv stick. So far is awful, firstly because I can't use most of the apps in it because I'm in DR. Secondly it keeps rebooting by itself! I think I was sent a faulty one. Tried to contact Amazon several times with no success. There's this thing every time I get out of an episode I'm watching on Netflix or Amazon Prime, it blanks and won't respond.So yeah, save your money.",1,1,2018-11-5,1,1,0
"So I love the fire stick. I do, it’s freaking awesome and all that. But when I upgraded to the 4K (and yeah, it really does make a HUGE difference over the regular), it just randomly stopped working one morning, four days after I bought it. Turned the tv on and nothing. Now, I called amazon and they’re sending me a new one, but here’s my gripe - my brand new technology stops working FOUR DAYS after I buy it, I spend 37 FREAKING MINUTES ON THE PHONE ABOUT IT, the dude finally says he’s gonna send me a new one and acts like I should freaking THANK him because “it’s free.” Are you serious? You think I’m gonna have to replace a brand-new item days after I bought it and PAY for the privilege? Plus the wasted time on the phone. I have NEVER had a REMOTELY bad experience with Amazon’s customer service, and while I realize this guy is likely just their one EEO choice, it left a nasty taste in my mouth. Ugh.Tl;dr: Thing crapped the bed after a couple days and Amazon’s customer service finally failed me.",1,1,2019-3-9,1,2,0
"I bought this primarily to compare to my 2017 Roku Ultra and to get Dolby Digital sound from Directv Now, which the ultra doesn't support for some reason.Setup was easy, plugged it into an extra input on my Denon x6200w.

"I have owned Fire TVs since the 1st generation box (2x 1st gen, 2x Sticks, 2x Pendants), and I have never had a problem with the hardware or streaming performance. These 4k Fire TV Sticks have put an end to that good luck.The main problem is an audio issue that causes the sound to cut out every 5 minutes or so of streaming video. It will stay cut out for several seconds, then come back with a very noticeable delay (500ms or so) which makes Netflix or streaming TV unwatchable. I have also seen strange picture glitches when streaming 4k HDR content.",1,1,2018-11-27,1,1,0

"Was going to buy two more of these after I used it for awhile, this is a quicker device than previous gen models...for now. Buyer beware if you expect this to mirror or receive casts from your phone or tablet... It won't do that anymore... previous gens did!!! Very dissatisfied. If you want that feature (I sure do) then buy something else. Thanks to OS upgrades on my first gen and second gen sticks, they are becoming unusable due to slow performance of the bloated Amazon OS. Also, if you live stream Thursday NFL on the device it's super choppy and studders in the video, it's unwatchable. Second gen played NFL great, very smooth. I have this new stick wired to Ethernet and it sucks only with NFL live stream, everything else plays pretty smooth. I've played Amazon streams, Netflix, hulu etc, just an issue with NFL... Defective?",1,1,2018-11-21,1,2,0
"Its a great device but difficult to manage and not very user friendly. The hidden print is that you dont get ""500k free movies and apps and channels"" youtube is free and they have some free nature sounds channel and some kid games. Most everything else you have to buy or have a subscription to. Its 99 dollars a year for Amazon prime movies and pretty much anything else you want on Amazon site. Then Netflix , Hulu, Starz, HBO now, Sling, etc. ALL have a paid subscription. Also, if you want to watch anything that is on regular cable channels you have to have a TV provider (dish, direct tv, etc) so if you want to watch you have to pay for cable which is the WHOLE point of cutting the cord. If you pay for cable anyway why would you need this? The Alexa is pretty useless too. She always opens the wrong thing. At least I got it on prime day at half off. I already had my cable turned off so I have to live with it.  Don't bother, stay with cable.",2,1,2019-8-5,1,2,0
"Zero is my rate for this product. This product is 100% shit. I rather have Roku with live TV and more with no issues.4hrs of installation, even changed the wifi password and I still plan on returning this. NO LIVE TV. Basically nothing current, you dont get channels automatically, you have to download them or pay and still won't be live channels. Nothing is easy to find. A movie trailer played and then when I asked Alexa to find it, an app popped up which I had to download to watch the movie and also had to chose which way to watch and then find out I had to get another device. Parental control is soo over used I had to turn it off after 45 mins. I have never been more disappointed in a product and this is my 1st Amazon device product.  I won't buy any Amazon device products.",1,1,2018-12-5,1,2,0
"I've been using the FireTV stick for about two years, so I was a little skeptical ordering the 4G stick. That ""skeptical"" label can be removed right now. App downloads are much shorter, and the picture is much sharper. So far it hadn't needed repowering (like when the old stick became stuck). All that might change next week, but right now I think Amazon has hit a home run with this product.",5,1,2018-11-5,1,3,0

"Two issues: first, random audio loss, no matter the app or source... Doesn't happen on same services on different hardware (PS4), then, second, payed $50, less than 30 days later on sale for 15 less. I'm getting so tired of Amazon. Oh yeah, and tech support for the audio...""reset the stick, check your internet""... Doesn't even listen that I've already done all of that!Otherwise, this could have been awesome! Great AV system control... The remote control features are the best. This could be a great piece of hardware if it functioned properly and I didn't get ripped off just for being an early adapter...",1,1,2018-11-27,1,2,0
"I received the Fire TV Stick 4K on launch day. I own the previous model and this is a much better experience. First off the remote is a huge improvement. The power button on the remote can turn on my tv, my receiver, fire stick, and switch the inputs automatically so the fire stick is on screen and ready to go with just one click of the power button. It's really nice. This is how it should have been all along. It gets even better though... lets say my TV is already on, and my receiver is set to a different input such as my FIOS tv box? All you do is click the home button on the remote and the remote switches the receiver to the correct hdmi input on the receiver for the fire stick! One remote to rule them all, and yes it controls volume on the receiver too! This is excellent. It's highly configurable. The setup is quite nice. You can define which inputs get picked when hitting the power and home button. You can define which device the volume buttons control. Amazon has done a great job with the Fire Stick 4K.It's faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. I've used Roku, Chromecast Ultra and Fire Stick... I like them all for different reasons. I also dislike chromecast because 5.1 audio will not work on my receiver because chromecast refuses to support Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1. Fire stick has no problem handling DD5.1. This makes my plex and netflix experience much more enjoyable. The remote is better than not having a remote (chromecast). Roku's are very nice as well. All 3 of these options are great in their own way and frankly I had thought fire stick was the least desirable but recently I've come to realize I prefer Fire stick so I pre-ordered the 4K fire stick and I could not be happier with it. Amazon needs to keep up the good work. The 4K stick is a solid product and an excellent upgrade from the previous model",5,1,2018-11-5,1,5,0
"It's OK, a bit over hyped. Even though benchmarks show this is more powerful than the cube and the pendant, in actuality, there is no real world difference. I was annoyed because pairing this with the dot only had limited success. Once every thing is on, the navigation works fine, the voice commands ""open Netflix"", ""tune in ABC""(if you have Hulu live)- will work fine. The 2 main voice commands I need to I need to work through the dot are "" Alexa power on and Alexa power off"" to power on/off the fire TV stick and the TV. The voice command functionality to control system power on/off through the remote control works perfectly- so I know everything is communicating properly between he Fire TV stick and the TV. I can get the TV to turn-on by saying ""Alexa tune to ABC"" for instance. The problem here is that after I turn the power off,  when I turn it back on and go back to Hulu- there is no sound- Then I have to force-stop Hulu and restart the app to get sound back. I don't know if that's a bug in Hulu or in the pairing of the dot/fire TV- but either way it makes the roundabout way of using the dot voice command to power on the Fire TV and TV useless. I called Amazon support on this and they verified the same results as I had both with documentation and testing it during my chat session. The volume up/down also does not work through voice command via the dot. I think the most important dot pairing functionality is missing (voice command controlling power on/off) hopefully in the future they will fix this. The device on it's own is OK, the antenna is not as good as the one in the cube. If you want system voice control (without needing to pick up the remote) and more consistent streaming capability, I would recommend the Cube over this device.",3,1,2018-11-12,1,3,0
"if you have small kids, I don't recommend this installed on their TV, you can put parental controls, but if you have scary movies in your watchlist, the covers will appear; so if you want to watch something with them, I suggest you look it up first without them, not like NETFLIX where if you have a kids profile, they won't see scary stuff. Can't believe AMAZON can't work on that (i called to ask) if anyone has a workaround doesn't include watching deleting your watchlist) please share",1,1,2018-11-14,1,2,0

"Let me tell you, I was super excited for the launch of the new FireTV Stick with its leading edge technology and processing power.  Well, it’s got that but there’s a couple bug, game breaking problems I have with this thing.1) The Amazon platform is basically retooled Android, which is a crap interface. It’s cluttered, redundant, and Amazon being Amazon wants you to use all their services over everyone else’s so not only does their menu get in the way but the top third of the home screen is promotions for whatever they want to push.",3,1,2018-11-11,1,3,0
"Our main streaming service is DirecTV Now, and this stick doesn't run it right. The app seems to works and then just freezes. When I go to run a speed test, the connection is super low, and then ramps up over time back up to full speed. It's as though the app crashes the stick.  Other things seem to work fine, but not the app we use the most.  Will return and continue to use gen 2 and gen 3 devices. Too bad.UPDATE: So, I deleted DirecTV Now and did a fresh install. For the past three days, things actually worked well and considered revising my rating. Then I tried to watch a little Sunday football. CBS froze over and over again and caused the app to continually crash. Thought maybe it was the local CBS stream because other channels worked fine. Then I tried the Roku I have in my kids room, DirecTV Now worked fine. Figured I'd give it another go for the second game, same result. Watched Rams/Seahawks in my kids room with no issue on the Roku device. Again, other apps seem to work fine (I think) on Fire, but this stick isn't right just yet. I'd wait for problems to work itself out.",1,1,2018-11-6,1,2,0
"I was looking for replacing my Roku LT streaming box which was released 100 years ago (in electronics years.) I couldn't resist when Amazon threw the trade-in offer at my face with $25 off for a Fire TV, and 2.99 cash value.",4,1,2018-11-5,1,2,1
"Ok, so if your like me you wonder what exactly does Fire Stick do? Well 1st. saves you a lot of money Compared to having say, a Genie with 5 tv's hooked up. 2nd. gives you the option of more, lots more to watch, may even be overwhelming in choices. 3rd. Less HDMI cables to purchase. So lets get to what it really does, gives you apps like Prime video, Netflix, Hulu, and too many channels to list here. That's I think why they don't. Get every channel including many local channels that you can think of, like TNT,SYFY, PBS and so on. HBO, Starz, and those channels like Netflix are at a cost but add it up and you will probably, more then likely save a lot over cable or satellite. Sports are a little different as far as some places have, local sports channels you can get included in your cable package. This you will have to pay for unless your watching live on local channels.Now what's different between Fire tv and Roku Ultra besides the price? No VUDU on Fire tv, which if you are like me I have movies on there for yrs. Anyway no HDMI cable is needed for Fire tv it plugs straight in to your TV, Receiver or equipment like an OPPO Blue-ray player and so on. The two are the same except those four things. VUDU, HDMI cables, and price. each have quad-core processors, 4k at 60fps. and Voice control. Fire stick seems to preform very well if you hook it up correctly. So in the short of it go with FireTV stick, if you want to spend far less depending on how many TV's you have, and you like ALexa voice control. If you don't mind paying  more and want things like VUDU go with the other. You could do like I did because we have 4 people watching TV's to get both. Each give you two people at a time watching other channels or devices. I have two FIRETV Sticks and two ROKU's. 2 are straight into TV's for full 4k at 60fps, 1 straight through my receiver and another through my OPPO 105D which give me 4k at 30fps. True 4k at 60fps is very rare out there yet so most equipment that's just a few yrs. older will still give you 4k but at 30fps. I personally don't see a difference but it's hard to find a show that is recorded at a true 4k 60fps. as of NOV. 2018. Oh I missed something important to me but not others as much which is ROKU Ultra has a net cable connector and wi-fi which FIRETV does not. I like the fact that there is never a problem with connection or speed with a net cable versus wireless, plus you don't have to type in your security code with a net cable connection to setup.",4,1,2018-11-10,1,3,1

"I got this because I needed it to operate with the new Fire TV Recast. Bottom line is the Roku Ultra wins out easily based on the quality of 4k video plus the abundance of streaming apps like Vudu with 4K content. I got this for 4K which it indeed does but it fails miserably on a high end OLED screenThe 4k video out from FireTV 4k Stick absolutely fails on my LG OLED screen. I uploaded two pictures running credits (black background / white text) of the same movie. One picture shows the ""black"" of the screen almost greyish while the other picture is the same movie credits but through my Roku 4K and the black is as it is supposed to be on OLED which is all true black.

"My only regret with this Fire TV Stick is that I waited so long to buy it.  Let me get right down to it:  I have an older smart TV, was told I didn't need it but I certainly do.  And it works fabulously.  In fact, the connection and clarity are so much better with this stick than without it that I'll watch Netflix through this operating system, which is just superior to the Google Chromecast that came with our TV and is cumbersome and just plain odd.  Amazon makes a smart TV truly smart, which is what it was meant to be.  What a fabulous bargain vs. Directv or previous cable!  We've cut our bill from $70/month for a basic TV package (after all the supposed promotions expire on any cable service or sattelite) to $119/annually for Amazon Prime which we get anyway for shipping, books, etc., plus Netflix $8/month plus Hulu $8/month plus all the wonderful stuff on Amazon Prime with their channels and music.  We now have more channels than we can ever watch.  If you really want to boggle the mind, add the Netlix DVD subscription for a couple bucks a month and get recent movies that you can't get on streaming and voila!  Better TV and better program channels without all the dumb ads.  Why did I wait so long?  You don't have to!  This is a hands-down fabulous product that works right out of the box.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,2,0
"I love this thing! I can watch Prime video, Hulu, Netflix, and a really good selection of free apps. Easy to use, Alexa works great when we are looking for a specific movie.

"If you're new to Fire Sticks or you're wondering what the difference is between the new 4K and the older models, then let me help you!  I have both (one for each TV)  and while they are both more or less the same thing, the new 4K version is worth the extra couple of bucks due to the extra speed and increased convenience of some thoughtful features.The 4K version has the new upgraded Alexa remote, which is such a triumph compared to the older Alexa remote, due to the fact that they've finally added power, mute, and volume buttons.  Hooray!  No more scrambling around for your TV or cable company remote control when you need to change the volume in a hurry.  The voice controls are also more sophisticated in this version, so that I can actually tell Alexa to ""switch back to HDMI 1"" or ""switch back to cable TV"", rather than toggling the Input button  on your TV or cable remote.",5,1,2019-1-17,1,6,0
"I waited to start season 3 of Man in the High Castle JUST so I could watch this season in 4k HDR with Atmos. And the only way to get that trifecta is with this device. I'm sad to report that so far the only thing that seems to stream in 4k HDR with Atmos is Jack Ryan. The ONLY thing. Even that has been hit and miss. Sometimes its' got all three, sometimes it's just 1080p HDR with Atmos. Sometimes it's 1080p no hdr and no atmos. The Netflix app doesn't seem to support HDR or Atmos at all. No matter what title.The diagnostic shows my signal is 'Very Good' over my 5Ghz home wifi. I'm getting stellar 4k HDR Atmos content on my Apple TV 4k. It sit's right next to my Fire TV Stick 4k. I've rebooted, updated, restarted, etc. I've worked with two nice associates over the phone about the issue. So far the results are still the same. The last rep I spoke with said that they had forwarded my issue to 'the developers'. I was told I should expect a call back today. We'll see how that goes.",3,1,2018-11-6,1,5,0
"I really wanted for this product to work but unfortunately it failed miserably. I got tired of having to switch devices to have support for 4k, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Atmos sound. Each device supported one thing vs another but none supported all the options at the same time - which was what Fire TV 4k claimed.Really cared about 3 applications: Netflix, Prime Video and YouTube and none worked as advertised. For starters, Atmos sound never worked for all three. Prime has (to my knowledge) only one show as DV + Atmos : Ryan. The stick played it only in HDR + 5.1 + 4K.",1,1,2018-11-9,1,5,0

"I have spent the entire day on the phone with Amazon troubleshooting and trying to return one of these new 4K Fire Sticks. Back and forth between tech support and sales. Hours upon hours; talk about the runaround. They just do not want to accept that there new and improved devices have a weaker wifi signal than the older GEN 2 Firesticks. I ordered 2 new 4K sticks. One receives a very good signal in my Living room 30 feet from the router. The second device receives NO signal at this location. They nearly refused to exchange the device because it does work ""5 feet"" from the router.

"I have an Amazon fire stick on every TV. I bought a 4K TV about three months ago and, when I saw the new 4K fire stick on a black Friday deal, I ordered it. I installed this new 4K fire stick just like I installed any other fire stick except for the new steps whereby you program the new remote control to control the volume, receiver, TV, etc. My TV setup all runs through the receiver to one HDMI port in the back of my TV. Very simple set up. All the other fire sticks worked fine, no problem. So I followed the fire stick set up instructions which are super easy and started to watch my new 4K fire stick. Great. Loved it. Then, it was time to watch something on cable so I flipped the input on my receiver to my cable box like I have done hundreds of times since it was set up over three years ago.  White static.  No signal.  All I did was unplug the old fire stick which was working fine, plug-in the new 4K fire stick, set it up, that’s it and nothing more. White static instead of my cable box. Nothing was touched, nothing was changed, just a swap of the fire sticks. So tonight I called customer service and that is why you see the interesting photograph attached to this review. They picked up right away, no hold time to get an agent on the phone. I got nowhere in 45 minutes with this agent. She put me on hold twice because admittedly she didn’t know what to do and was chatting online with some “higher up“ agent which she couldn’t put me on the phone with. The second time I was on hold was the last 25 minutes of the 45 minutes in total. I just couldn’t stay on the phone any longer.  I’m very dissatisfied.",1,1,2018-12-3,1,1,0
I picked up this streaming stick yesterday at Best Buy to replace my old First Generation Fire TV box. Needless to say this stick is a huge upgrade in software and usability over my old box. Faster response times in all apps and the new remote alone makes it worth upgrading.Once I hooked the stick up it went through an easy setup process to recognize my TV and also find how to operate my old Yamaha Digital Sound Projector to control volume and mute functions. The power button on the remote controls my TV off and on as well. This effectively eliminates the need for my receiver and TV remote for most things. This is why I said the remote alone makes it worth the purchase. If you already have a device that is compatible with the new remote you can buy it separately for $30. I should note that my 1st Gen Fire TV does not work with the new remote and would not pair with it as it is not compatible.,5,1,2018-11-15,1,1,0
"Fantastic!  We gave up our cable months ago.  Installed an indoor antenna.  Received CBS and NBC local channels along with PBS.  Received everything in high definition.  With cable, we would have to pay extra.  With Fire Tv Stick we now get ABC.  Wasn’t very excited about voice recognition, but that proved exciting.  All in all, it is an inexpensive replacement for expensive cable.  Everything is available but I am hesitant to be charged a monthly fee at present.  Maybe someday.  And then it would be less than half of what we were paying for cable,",5,1,2018-11-5,1,2,0
"I see where people had all kinds of negative experiences and believe the key may be that your TV is connected to the wrong part of your router. Mine was. I have DirectV and ATT fiber to the house. Check to see if your router has two connection speeds. Mine did. Everything kept stalling on me until a really savvy tech guy at ATT figured out that all of my new tech items (Echos, etc.) were all hooked up to the same slower speed on my router. The instructions for the  new Fire Stick say, be sure you have it hooked up to work with a higher speed on your router. The tech at ATT put my Smart TV and the TV with Fire Stick on the guest network setting which is much faster. All problems disappeared. Its working great although I've yet to figure out if I need to change the input everytime I decide to watch streaming TV or go back to regular DirectV.",5,1,2018-11-26,1,1,0
"I purchased this TV stick with great anticipation. The New GE83000 Chipset for graphics, was really the key selling point for me... Little did I expect a product flaw to manifest itself. The MTK8695+MT7668 Wifi Architecture has an inherent flaw in maintain a good consistent connection to the network. I'm an IT professional for a living, and deal specifically in networking. I've spent the better part of 5 days, and many hours trying to isolate the problem, to no success. The Problem is the connection will spike and time out randomly every 5-10 minutes. Most streaming services response with a slight stutter, others completely freeze, and forget playing on games via multiple, it simply does not work.

"Let me start off by saying we love all of our Amazon products. We currently use an older gen Firestick with our Ultra HD LG TV. It has worked great for years but when we saw the 4K was on sale, we figured we would try it out. After 3 days of use with the 4K stick, our TV began to glitch. It would get stuck on the volume mode flashing between level 10 and mute. It would change menus when nobody was pressing buttons. After being told we may have a “bug” in our TV, we narrowed the issue down to being from the Firestick. I couldn’t find any negative reviews between this product and LG to confirm our suspicions. But seeing as the TV works fine with our older Firestick and without the 4K, I can only assume it was that. We may order the product again to see if the first one we received was defective. I will update my review if so.",1,1,2018-12-16,1,1,0
"I have had nothing but trouble with this product.  I can only say that it's got some sort of design flaw.  Though the picture quality is good the sound quality is frustrating.  Randomly the sound drops for a microsecond, just enough to be disturbing.  Sometimes not at all, sometime only a few time during a film or other times practically every few seconds.  I thought maybe my TV and old sound bar were to blame.  I bought a new tv and upgraded sound bar and I still have problems.  Tech support told me that it was because my sound bar wasn't registered (or linked) to my Fire account.  The tech very politely and patiently walked me through that process but to no avail.  I looked on Google and it seems that I am only one in a crowd of people experiencing the same problem.  Last night the problem was so bad that I decided I wanted to exchange it for another in hopes of getting a non-defective device.  My device is return eligible through July 6, 2019.  The customer service rep that I was required to contact did not seem to understand my frustration and actually told me I it would be a warranty issue!  I reminded them that it is return eligible through July 6 and I shouldn't have to deal with a warranty run around.  Up until that point I was ready to try another device.  I was finally sent a return label.  I""m not sure what I will do next, maybe try a Roku?  I'm so very disappointed and defeated.  I have two other (older) Fire devices on other TVs that have no issues at all. Oh, and this is the BEST part.  Amazon is charging me shipping to return their defective product!

"In my opinion, this has got to be the best Fire TV devise so far.  I have every Fire TV since Amazon got into the streaming business, and this is the fastest with the best picture and sound of them all.  I also use the latest 4K Roku, 4K Apple TV and the Chrome-cast Ultra, yeah, I'm a streaming junkie.  My go-to streamer has been the Roku, but now I have to re-think that, as the new Fire TV stick just looks a little better, and seems faster.  The Apple TV is nice, but do not like the remote.  The Chrome-cast has really nice picture and sound quality, but don't like the fact that you have to ""cast"" what you want, like Netflix, etc, from your cell phone, and Chrome-cast does not support Amazon Prime.  So, with all that said, I like the new Fire TV stick and will use it probably more than the others.",5,1,2018-11-16,1,1,0
"We recently bought 5 of these 4K Fire TV Sticks, and we were planning to add a couple more. We have a big house and lots of TV's. It is a great streaming device, but I was surprised that there's no way to completely turn off the device unless power is removed. I tried putting it in sleep mode under settings, and my Tenmars TM-195 3-Axis RF Field Strength Meter still shows frequent very strong bursts of activity. I don't know why it would need to be transmitting all of the time.Edit: I just saw the bad quality of the video after Amazon's algorithm compressed it, and it's difficult to see the values on the meter. Sorry about that, but the meter jumps about 50 times more powerful from the opening EMF readings. Then it subsides for a few seconds then jumps back up again.",3,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0

"UPDATED REVIEW:After making some updates and some trial and error I have the product functioning fairly well. Amazon suggested that I update the firmware on my router. That helped tremendously. It made a major difference on the speed of download and also did away with most of the buffering issues I was having. That is a must do step for anyone wanting to use one of these. I still had terrible picture quality on Netflix but I discovered the source of that. While trying to install Hulu it told me that I had to disable my VPN in order for Hulu to install. That made me think maybe that was the problem with Netflix. Sure enough, turn off the VPN and Netflix has a good picture quality.",3,1,2018-11-23,1,1,0
"This device might be good if you can get it to work properly. Maybe I received a defective device, but I have wasted over 3 hours and a lot of anger trying to get Amazon to send me a replacement. the problem is that I received it as a gift from my parents who live 1000 miles away, so there is no way for them to return it, but I also can't exchange it for a new one because I didn't buy it. Have been a Prime member for over 10 years and never been so frustrated with Amazon customer service. Usually they are pretty good handling my problems, but this has been a ridiculously frustrating experience.

So to use volume or turn-off, etc. would mean going back and forth.  Plus there were other incompatibilities!!  Well, this happened of course 4 days after the no return date!!!

The Fire Stick remote is larger with real buttons, a home button (come on Apple), replaceable batteries and real forward and reverse buttons that are much more responsive than Apple's. It also turns the TV on and off.Edit 1 week later:  Taking off a star because Amazon inserts UNSKIPPABLE commercials for their ""original"" shows. This may cause me to plug the AppleTV back in.

I bought 3 of these around black friday time so thankfully paid only $25 for them.

The Fire Stick requires you to watch commercials. You can't fast forward. When you fast forward during a show you can’t see what you are skipping. Our DVR lets you see while fast forwarding. Very disappointed given all of the 5 star reviews. Haven’t watched commercials for years. Not for me I guess.UPDATE - Amazon called in response to this review (Very impressed btw!). Amazon customer service is excellent! They explained the inability to skip commercials was controlled by the network app (NBC in this case) and not a limitation of the Fire Stick. Makes sense. Upgraded rating to 3 stars. Fast forwarding during a show is still an issue as you cannot see a preview only a time stamp. Picture is very clear.,3,1,2019-7-16,1,6,0

Once reseted, it still gone back to the red screen. I unplugged and replugged the Stick into the outlet, now it shows a black screen of death. I unplugged and replugged the Stick into another HDMI port, still the same. Mind you, I'd tried to use the included dongle from the box to no avail.

At first I thought it was only in the HBO Now app but then the Home-screen started glitching. Keep in mind I got it Friday too! I am so sick that I have to return it.

"Still requires anyone with a significant UV/Vudu library to maintain a Roku/ATV, etc if you have a lot of movies that are UV only (Paramount, etc.).  (I'm aware of the sideloading option and hoped it would address this problem but a) currently locks up all playback on the FireTV if I try to play a UHD movie via sideloaded Vudu b) support still stinks because those UV only movies don't show up in FireTV search (and do on Roku)).  Maybe someday the remaining UV members will join MoviesAnywhere.  Or maybe Amazon will get a clue and get a deal in place so Vudu is supported (or join what's left of UV)  (Note to Amazon - I'd be more likely to buy movies from Amazon if I didn't have to leave your device to see what I own in Vudu on a different device, because I then just buy there.)  5 stars if Amazon ever understands enlightened self-interest and either deals with Ultraviolet or Vudu.On the plus side, when connected to a TV that won't properly pass Dolby Digital plus to a receiver or sound bar, this device allows you to select DD only so that the Fire TV transcodes DD+ for output over ARC or optical.

"I was forced to buy a new 4k model when my old firestick stopped working, and couldn't finish the boot process.  That 4k firestick along with a second 4k model purchased in the last month are now $100 worth of trash.  They garbage compared to the previous, model that I owned, which at least lasted for a little over a year before it died.  I bought the one for the bedroom to replace the dead one, and decided to get another for the living room.  Now neither one works.  Both stuck in an infinite loop, continuously powering on and off.  Won't even stay on long enough to do a factory reset.  Looking online people suggest changing out the power block which I have done.  I've tried 4 different Samsung fast charging blocks as well as 3 different Firestick blocks, and a couple Apple iPad 2.1 amp blocks.  Nothing changes.  The price went up from under $30 each to over $50 but neither unit made it through a month. I get it, the old units didn't do 4K, but neither do these new ones, now.  I'll be calling Amazon support tomorrow, but I bet they won't fix the problem. They'll just do like they did last month and tell me they're out of warranty and all they can do is sell me a new one.  What ever happened to quality manufacturers, and companies standing behind their products.  From talking to friends and co-workers they sell an awful lot of these Firesticks.  Everyone I know has at least one.  Can't they talk to their Chinese supplier to get them to improve product reliability, or is the low quality of these new models Amazon's fault, because they've pushed their suppliers to use cheaper components to meet a lower price point?  They're just little android bootable drives when it comes down to it.  We don't really need to buy Firesticks.  There are a million Android tv boxes sold online.  There must be at least one of them that uses quality parts, even if it costs a little bit more, it's worth it, in my opinion, not to have to deal with all the time and aggravation of trying to find and then testing out all these supposed ""fixes"".

I purchased this item as part of a bundle with the new Recast and a digital antenna.  Once part of a bundle ships, trying to cancel and return an item appears to be impossible, even with the Amazon help line's assistance.  Now, to just change over to the 2nd generation fire stick I have to wait until the whole bundle ships, return them, ensure I get my gift cards refunded back to me, and then try again from scratch.  I'll be using this time to look at other options entirely.  I WILL NEVER bundle again, and I am not sure I'll be getting any more Amazon products.",2,1,2018-11-12,1,1,0

"I'm a huge fan of the FireTV Stick. I've probably ordered 10-12 for both me and other family members. The first thing that I noticed with the 4K version was then certain channels started to skip frames (i.e. Hallmark). A  Netflix original, The Crown, was also doing the same thing and I stopped watching it because it was so bad.  The strangest thing about the 4K version is that it won't hold the TV settings (brightness, contrast). As I was watching a show, the picture steadily got darker. I thought maybe my TV wasn't working properly, so I put the older FireTV stick back on the TV and both issues were no longer a problem. I expected more from this new version. I would avoid buying it until software updates fix these problems. I will be returning this tomorrow. Also, I think Amazon was sensitive to the battery cover being too hard to use, and as a result, the 4K remote didn't have a tight fit.",1,1,2018-12-9,1,7,0
"EL dispositivo para ver streaming es muy bueno, tambien para juegos.

Adicionnalmente como no reconoce memorias con otros formatos como NTFS limita al dispositivo por no poder ver los videos grabados en 4k con el osmo pocket.

"I have an older Fire TV Stick that works good, but when I plugged this one in I was taken back by how much faster it is! Where I used to wait for it to load after the old one went to sleep, this one is almost instantaneous. Even though I don't have a 4K tv, the images are much clearer and the colors brighter. The addition of an on-off button and volume control for the tv makes my tv remote useless as I can do everything I need with the firestick 95% of the time. I have had some wifi issues that I believe are related to this new stick, thus the 4 stars. IE: I have had multiple times where the dreaded little spinning circle will appear on my tv/program, usually in the middle of watching something. Since the network setting on the firestick showed I had a good connection without problems, I assumed it was my extender that was causing the problem so I kept changing locations with the extender and the firestick to no avail. Last night it was acting up really bad where I couldn't watch anything so I 1) rebooted the wifi extender which didn't fix it, then 2) rebooted the main wifi/modem, which didn't fix it then 3) rebooted the firestick by unplugging and plugging it back in and problem resolved. So, I think it's safe to assume the firestick was causing the problem. Once rebooted I haven't had any problems. At least I know that if I have this happen again how to fix it. Overall, I'm very happy with this firestick.",4,1,2018-12-1,1,6,0
"I have an older Fire TV stick whose remote looks similar to this one.  Only the added volume/mute and power buttons are new - long overdue.  I don't use Alexa anywhere so I can't comment on that.The big problem I have is the formatting of the channel guide.  The stations are listed horizontally across the top and the times down the side.  You could fit more channels per screen if they were listed vertically, as a major competitor does.  Also, when you finally get to the end of the channel guide and want to go back to the beginning, you have to scroll all the way back - it doesn't wrap around!  To its credit, the fast backward button can be held down and scrolling will continue until the button is released, unlike the competitor.  I have psvue and assume the the same behavior is found in other streaming services.",4,1,2018-11-9,1,5,0
"The Fire stick didn't work.  I contacted Amazon and was directed to try several different orientations, including finding another television.  The technician only wanted to tell me it was my fault it did'nt work.  I finally through it in the trash and went to Roku.",1,1,2019-7-15,1,1,0
"I will start by saying that indeed the new stick offers a lot of bang for the buck. It was nice that volume controls, mute and Power were added to the remote. The 4K and HDR abilities are awesome for a device that cost so little. My Fire TV box has been awesome from day one. Plenty fast, great picture, easy to navigate and well worth the cost. This new stick however, while offering so much takes a major turn when it comes to picture quality. This might sound unusual to some people but I actually purchased the device to use with my Roku 4K HDR TV. The TV itself has a beautiful picture but when it comes to the Roku part and my streaming TV service provider, DirecTV now, less attention apparently has been paid to getting the DirecTV Now app working as well for a Roku TV as it does for most people with a stand-alone Roku. My Fire TV box is Flawless with my TV service. The inability to change channels quickly by simply holding down the scroll button it's where the Roku Falls flat for people who need to change channels with in particular apps like so many streaming apps today. The Roku is also slow to pull up the program guide and change channels. This is where the new Fire TV stick comes in. It indeed shines brightly when it comes to changing channels fast and the program guides pulling up immediately. It does take longer for the picture to stabilize at a higher quality with the stick compared to my TV box. The quality is very off though.  there are quite a few options available to fine-tune things within the new Fire TV stick and I've played around with all of the settings but none will allow the picture quality to shine the way it does using the TV normally or on my TV which uses the Fire TV box. I have an old Fire TV stick in another room which handles the menus, channel changes and picture quality so much better. Most people might be able to live with their picture looking more like it is a grainy 720 resolution. There is such a drastic difference though between the regular TV picture quality through the built-in Roku app vs this new Fire TV stick. If someone has found a workaround or knows if there is an issue that is being addressed, I would love to hear about it. Outside of that one major complaint, this is definitely a great device for the money. If Amazon and Google ever come to terms with YouTube, it will be even better having the regular YouTube app back again.",3,1,2018-11-10,1,1,0
"I've been a Roku user since they came out (current model is the Premier Plus) but I was starting to have to reboot it often when playing UHD content (mostly in Netflix; I don't recall issues with Amazon).  I decided to give the Fire Stick 4K a try to see if it would fix my video issues..  I've only used it one day and so far the video is better (and it is noticeably faster).  The bad part, and what I think others experience, is sound drops (about 5 per hour; less than a second, both on Netflix and Amazon content).  I would get this very, very, infrequently with the Roku; but on the Fire Stick it is too frequent.I plug my Fire Stick directly into the same HDMI port as I did with my Roku; on a Yamaha RX-V483.  My TV is an LG OLED.",4,1,2018-11-9,1,1,0
"I was incredibly disappointed to learn after purchasing the new Fire TV Stick 4K that Amazon had removed Miracast from the device functionality. It had been included in previous generations and I had no reason to believe it wouldn't be in this one. This means that you cannot cast or mirror your laptop/mac screen to the TV using the Fire Stick. That was one of the main reasons I purchased it so I wouldn't need to plug my Mac into the TV via an HDMI and adapter anytime I wanted to stream a non-Netflix, non-app supported video. Especially considering I bought the Fire Stick for a smart tv that already has much of the Fire Stick's functionality built in. I also was hoping that my Echo Dot 2nd gen. would integrate better with the Fire Stick. That was the only reason I got Amazon's product instead of a Google Chromecast and the Amazon products truly do not work as well together as they should. For context, I also have both a Google Home Mini and a Chromecast for my Bedroom TV. In my opinion, if you already have a smart tv that can play Netflix and Hulu, there is no reason to get this device",3,1,2018-12-3,1,1,0

"I bought this as an upgrade from the first gen firestick and could not be happier.  Our dog chewed up and destroyed the tv remote for this tv awhile back and we were unable to find a replacement (for a reasonable price).  So we have been using the cable remote no problem. When we decided to cut the cord and get rid of cable I wasn’t thrilled about having to control the tv by only the buttons on the side of the tv. The firestick remote works PERFECTLY with our tv!  No it does not have an input option but with this tv we only watch hulu, netflix, and amazon so it always stays in the same hdmi input.  So happy with our purchase and will probably be buying a second one for the living room tv!A bit more info.....we had bought a couple “universal” remotes to work with this particular tv and none of them ever worked. The firestick remote gave me 5 tries (fingers crossed) for it to work and on the fifth try, it worked.  You choose the brand of tv and it gives you very simple instructions (changing the volume) to sync them.  I’m not tech savvy......at all..... and I hooked this up in about 5 mins.

"When you consider this small device can stream in 4k, the technology that went into making the 4k Fire TV Stick is really quite impressive. The user interface is quite snappy, although there can sometimes be a delay in populating the various menus/tabs. This could be due to the wireless network connection, although it is a 5GHz connection that is less than six feet away from the router. My current internet speed is not the best, at 25/3Mbps, but as its only user, 4k streaming should be possible with a small amount of overhead left over. My experience tells me, however, that this device would likely prefer connections a bit faster than this. I would assume anything 50Mbps or faster for download speed would be sufficient for smooth 4k streaming and faster menu population. I also found that my old Fire TV box worked much better with a wired connection, but I wanted to avoid that option if possible with the Stick, since it attaches directly to the HDMI port and I wanted to avoid putting any unnecessary strain on said port. All that being said, there is no reason to deduct a star for these issues, as they are both minor and in no way degrade the performance of the device (a solid 1080p picture looks almost as good as 4k at the distance I sit from a 70"" screen). Would recommend as an upgrade, especially when on sale.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,9,0

Not at all true, you can’t turn directv box o or off only tv and sound bar, then I was told to watch directv I had to download app, I downloaded app but couldn’t sign in Amazon that it a problem with the ATT app. I’m done with Fire products",1,1,2018-11-19,1,1,0
The Fire stick 4K is awesome! I was able to reduce my Directv bill from 160 dollars to 45 dollars by switching to their streaming service using this incredible gadget! It's easy to use and has all my Amazon benefits in one package as well as everything else you'll need. Streaming is where it's at and for that you need a Fire Stick. I purchased the 4K stick and the picture is absolutely incredible. Once again Amazon delivers!,5,1,2018-11-18,1,6,0
"While the Fire Stick 4K does connect to bluetooth speakers, it has two major failings.First, there is no compensation for the delay of bluetooth, which means that audio is out of sync. Tragic fail! Meanwhile, this is a basic feature of Android phones, syncing bluetooth audio with videos. It's especially obvious with Hulu.",1,1,2019-3-24,1,6,0
"I like Firestick 4K  very much. It enabled my older Smart TV to get YouTubeTV and other subscription channels as well, thus bypassing the cable company and its clunky set-top box and remote control and expensive cable-service fees. There are two things about Firestick 4K that need improving: (1) better layout of channels on screen; (2) having to use Restart too much. I am beginning to get the hang of channel surfing, and I really appreciate having only one remote control device. My wife often asks, ""What ever happened to off and on?"" Well, this Alexa-powered remote helps to answer her question about off and on, but then using that navigation button really challenges her. The screen designers need to spend some more time with housewives to make the interface easier to use. For example, my wife likes to watch Fox News, which comes up as a recently-watched channel. When we click on it from the Home screen, Fox News does not start playing; instead, there is a message to go to the computer and enter a 9-digit code. Very annoying, so she uses the voice-activated control via Alexa, and things get brighter. Voice recognition is excellent as is the stream quality of the video; in fact, I think the stream quality is much better than what we see using the set-top box and cable service (which we still subscribe to in case Firestick does not live up to the hype.) Firestick 4k is helping us to cut the cord!",5,1,2019-11-26,1,4,0
"I got the Fire Stick 4K today and promptly hooked it up. The TV is a newer LG and fully capable of 4K/UHD. The Fire Stick hooked up quickly and worked ok. The problem is the Amazon 4k programming. The available programming is so dark that most is just unwatchable, it's terrible. I watched bits of every 4K movie/series/everything available and only two were bright enough to realize the difference. BOSCH is not even worth viewing and it's even dark in HD.I've yet to see 4K or UHD shows via the stick, they are in HDR.  Why should I change the settings on my TV every time I want to watch TV with this device? I'm not going to so that's that.  I have triple checked every setting on my TV to make sure they are correct and optimum. I've had this TV just over a year so I believe I have it figured out.",4,1,2018-11-21,1,5,0

I do that & then it asks me to subscribe.  What was I already paying for? Then  Amazon sends me an email confirmation that I bought the app for $0.00. Price is fine but I have no idea what is happening and why I can't get what I thought I had already bought? Why do I have to buy separate apps? Somebody pls send links to help.",1,1,2020-9-24,1,4,0
This fire stick requires you to manually power off and on the fire stick each time you want to watch television. I have 2 of these remotes and they both have this same defect. The earlier fire stick never had this problem. I believe it is a software problem caused by the sloppiness of Amazon management trying to release these devices before they were fully tested.Later I was contacted by phone from Amazon on this problem. The lady whom I spoke with suggested clearing the cache on the HDHomeRun App which worked at first but later it failed just as before.  The Amazon lady kept telling me that the problem was with the  HDHomeRun App but that doesn't explain why this App works fine with the older version fire stick.,1,1,2019-1-10,1,7,0
I ordered this new 4K Stick after reading all the reviews.  I found that it is faster than the 2nd gen sticks that I was using.  Apps download and install very fast.  The only problem I found was that I could not get Sling TV app to install.  I subscribe through Amazon for my Sling TV.  I have it on my other sticks.  I chatted with an Amazon rep to see what the problem was.  I found out that the software of the new 4K stick does not support Sling TV.  My only course of action given me by the Amazon rep was to return the 4K Stick.  Very Disappointed,2,1,2018-11-20,1,1,0

"If you plan to use this to access your Fire TV Recast content from a location outside of your home, you must know that it will NOT access your Over-The-Air Content (OTA) from an HD Antenna.  This is such a glaring oversight I can't even believe it.  If i had known this i would not have purchased a Fire TV Stick, let alone 2 to go along with a Fire TV Recast..Let me explain...I recently cut the cord and installed an outdoor HD Antenna and wired it through my existing coaxial cable in my house.  That is amazing and now i get about 35 FREE HD channels.  The challenge was figuring out how to set up a DVR to record OTA content and stream content as well.  I did a lot of research and ended up buying a Fire TV Recast along with 2 Fire TV Sticks...  1 Fire TV Stick for use with the Fire TV Recast.  This has been great, the connection is good and it has the apps i need (Netflix, Prime, Hulu), and the menu and integration with the HD Antenna also works well.  I also downloaded the Fire TV App on my iphone and ipad.  This app is amazing as it lets you access your Fire TV Recast content (from anywhere) including your LIVE TV and DVR'd content.

"I have 3 Fire TV Stick 4K's. And I initially loved them when I first ordered them. But in the last few months, I have grown tired of them & I'm actively searching for a new brand of streaming player. Why you may ask? Because, after never having issues, I have been recently bombarded with messages that tell me memory is low & prompting me to delete apps. Usually in the middle of watching something, that message will pop up & stop all streaming. And I believe it is because Amazon decided to add something called FreeForm, IMBd, #AtHome & news: All apps i can't delete or remove. I never asked for these, I never downloaded them. But there they are, using valuable memory. And I can't get rid of them. I have never & will never use those apps. I checked them out & find zero value in them. But I'm stuck with them. It's disappointing to say the least. Even though it's more expensive, I may look into the NVIDIA shield media player. It's $150, but I believe they don't add bloatware to your device AFTER you've purchased it to completely ruin your streaming experience.Update: 8/27/2020: The memory issues have gotten progressively worse. I've had to delete even more of my apps and I'm constantly being asked to delete more. If I had known when I purchased these sticks that Amazon would add their own apps post-purchase and interfere with my streaming preferences, I would not have bought them. I have 3 of them and a recast. I am always getting the ""recast off line"" message, even though it isn't, but that's the least of my gripes. I am heavily invested in the amazon ecosystem, but I am finally gonna uninvest myself. I will still use prime, prime video & prime music, because I have no issues with their services. I am just looking for another way to stream. Do yourself a favor, before you buy this product, decide how many apps you really need. If it's reaching double digits, don't bother with this stick. If you're fine with 4 or 5, it should suit your needs just fine.",2,1,2020-6-17,1,3,0

I’ve had a Pioneer Kuro Plasma TV for the last ten years picture still looked great so I ordered the fire stick cause it said it would improve the quality of the picture. I’m sixty nine years and maybe I’m seeing things but by golly I think it does look better. I know for a fact that the sound coming from from surround sound system is definitely better. Only problem I have is wit the wheel sometimes it takes me a different screen and I have to exit out and start all over again. But al in all I’m very happy with it.

There are very few buttons, but it does what you need it to do.  The Alexa voice feature is awesome.  You can say ""Alexa, go to Netflix, and it goes to Netflix.  You can also ask your remote all the other Alexa stuff like ""Alexa, what is the temperature"", and she will respond through your TV speaker.  It contains tons of apps, and currently I have Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, MLBtv, and also found a America East app where I can watch college basketball.

This thing is a real PITA to setup.  The hardest part is getting the Firestick to recognize the Wi-Fi. No matter how hard I tried I could not get it to connect. The firestick kept telling me I had the wrong password even when I finally decided to push the WPA on the router.  I don't know how or why but it finally connected. I looked at some of the menus which is all I had time for since it took almost 2 hours to get this far. But I finally got it to work after having to download a browser.  I went to use it 2 days later and it would not connect to the WiFi  I had to push the WPA to hook up which took a while.  I went to use it again and it would not hook up.  I'm not going to keep running to my control panel to keep resetting my router for this thing.  Why won't it hook up with the password which I know is correct?

"I should just send this back - it's useless for mirroring, casting (worse than that beautiful- but just mocks me with my stupidity to think it would cast- maybe I need prior versions). BUT, BUT, BUT!!!! Amazon has removed ability to cast a PC screen (mirror) to firestick 4k- so all the beauty , amazing flexibly has been mortally wounded. No way to cast or stream your PC screen to fire stick 4k without jumping through 15 steps and buying more hardware- they actually went out of their way to remove mirroring. Workarounds are complex, if possible and costly. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED - it's become a paper weight if you wanted the great benefit of casting your PC screen to your TV, like Chrome-cast. Who made the decision to ruin this?And to think it's easily a cram-down sale afterwards. I'd hoped for so much more. The technology, simplicity i, packaging, etc. is elegant - but to through everyone under the bus and think no one would notice is what ruins products, sales, and development teams being shut down. Someone made a poor, poor decision based on some 'confidential' marketing plane of ho many people would be upset about mirroring/casting- they maybe misjudged as the weed blow by and their program closes.

To be fair if your good with coding you can do anything to this firestick so I have herd from people that are good at it. I found a video on youtube of a guy that gave the code and a couple of apps you can put on the fire stick for free. With this app i can stream any movie, tv show etc. You have to be in the app to access all of the downloads. I have not tried it for sports just because i'm not into sports.  It advertises Hulu, Netflix, Disney plus. etc You still have to have a subscription to get into these apps and watch the shows they provide.

"Updated review: Now that I have been using this thing for a while, I am updating my review. The internet connection on this thing is terrible! I bought the Ethernet adapter and it did not help. I primarily use it to stream Amazon prime Video. Whether I use the Wi-Fi or Ethernet, the shows often stall when I begin to watch them, then go to a very low resolution so it looks all blocky and blurry. I tested my internet connection, and it is plenty fast enough, so the problem is with the Stick. The TV is only 1080p, not 4k, so that is not an issue. I even tried changing settings to reduce the bandwidth needed (changed audio to basic stereo, etc.) and it did not help. My 10+ year old Blu-ray player streams amazon prime better than this stick. This stick cannot even satisfactorily perform its primary purpose: to stream Amazon Prime Video. It's pathetic. Do not buy.This Fire TV stick works OK, but has some annoying design flaws that could have been easily avoided. 1) The volume control is poorly implemented. Even though the Fire TV sticks all (theoretically) can use the HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) to control the device they are plugged into, this stick does not control the volume in that way. Instead this has an infrared emitter in the remote that controls the TV directly. That's fine if the stick is plugged into a TV, but most monitors can't be controlled by remote, so it will not control the volume on a monitor. By contrast, my tablet will easily control the volume on my monitor through the HDMI port, so I can watch Prime TV on my monitor from my tablet, but not from this stick. 2)  The stick is just a tiny bit wider than the standard spacing between HDMI ports, so if you want to plug this in next to another occupied HDMI port, it won't fit - you'll have to use the little HDMI extension cord included in the box. If they had simply chosen to make the stick just a tiny fraction of an inch less wide, it would fit. Another poor design choice. -- So to wrap it up -- this stick does sort of work, but not if you want to use it to control the volume on a monitor or plug it straight into a TV. This should have been a simple, inexpensive way to turn a monitor into a TV, but because of design flaws it doesn't really allow that.",1,1,2019-3-22,1,2,0
"I bought the standard version first and had horrible results. The unit buffered constantly. I read reviews that this is the result of processor speed.  Amazon did everything in their power to make the situation right. so if this was a review of Amazon Customer service they would get 5 stars plus. I also read that the 4k version had a faster processor so I gave this one a try.  Once again, constant buffering. I thought maybe it was my internet provider but I ran a speed test on two computers in my home ans I am getting 260 Mbps. Certainly fast enough to support video streaming.  Until Amazon upgrades these units, I recommend saving your money.",1,1,2019-7-15,1,5,0
"I was fully prepared to love the 4K Fire Stick when it arrived but sadly I can’t say I do. Certainly it has some great aspects such as excellent wi-fi range and speed, ease of use, and a great remote with TV power and volume controls. But there are fatal flaws in mine, most annoying of which are audio sync problems. Upon first seeing a significant sync problem I found a solution presented online. Simply set the “audio” settings of the device to “stereo” instead of allowing it automatically select among the available Dolby settings. Limiting the features included just to make it work isn’t exactly ideal but I could live with that. However we still get less severe audio sync issues, just enough to be annoying. It comes and goes. No fix found. There is also a problem with exiting Amazon Music and going to streaming live shows. No matter how I exit Music, when I open PSVue (our streaming provider) and play a show if we pause the video the last music we were playing restarts – loudly. Start the video and the music stops. It can be stopped by going into “Apps” and doing a forced stop on “Music” but this is temporary and will return. It can also be stopped by going into “Prime Video” and playing a few seconds of any show and then going to Vue. Again temporary and way too many clicks to be acceptable.I still have an old semi-obsolete Roku3 that I hooked up to another HDMI input on the same set, using the same wi-fi. There is no audio sync problem and there is no problem with “Music” not closing. And yes, I have swapped the units between the two HDMI inputs with no change. I’m now looking at a newer Roku with an expanded remote.  More money but hopefully less annoying.",4,1,2019-9-17,1,2,0
"First off, the big problem we're facing is it's very unclear when you're making a purchase for money, vs watching something that's free.  This product ignores your Amazon Prime settings that put up a password screen before purchasing something, even when it's running the Amazon Prime app.  If you tell the Fire Stick to please use a pin code before purchasing, it throws up that pin code every time you enter anything, including entering Netflix to watch stuff for free.  So again, it's entirely unclear whether you're going to spend money vs just watch for free.  Family members keep buying stuff because of this egregious UI flaw.  And it kinda feels intentional.  It feels like they're trying to trick people into making purchases.  Or they're just really, really bad at User Experience.The other problem is some apps don't pause properly; you have to HOLD down the pause button to keep the movie paused.",3,1,2019-8-24,1,2,0
"Revised. I have raised my review to 3* from 1*. I tried every adjustment I could think of to make the problem disappear. I gave up and switched on my old firestick and it worked flawlessly. So, I unplugged the 4k Firestick from the 2.0 HDMI and plugged it into the standard HDMI. The problem went away and it worked like it should. So, why only 3* you ask? If it wont give a great picture plugged into the 2.0HDMI, then what good is a 4k device?1st off, I have 2 other firesticks(basic) and a Roku Premium plus. They all work fine but the 2 firesticks didn't have a volumn control, so I decided to upgrade to the 4k firestick. Its plugged into my 2.0 hdmi. The sports I watch have a stutter with the new stick that does not happen with the other sticks. Nice clear picture, but watching a baseball fly through the air, well you see 3 flickering stuttering balls (no Im not drinking and my glasses fit fine) This is a no go for me unless someone can give me a fix. Like I said, this is the only one of 4 sticks that does this.",1,1,2019-8-21,1,2,0
"Finally, Amazon decided to add volume and TV power button as well.  Before, you were forced to use two remotes (TV remote for volume and power on/off the TV, and then the Amazon Stick or Fire TV remote to operate the rest).Generally speaking, this is a decent product but it could improve:",3,1,2019-5-24,1,2,0
"Smooth operation even though it's wireless.  4K UHD looks great.  Does Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos on limited titles now.  Hoping there are more in the future.  One thing I have noticed and I'm letting this slide as I hope a new update will fix this.  Some shows that are in Dolby Vision (The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) are only in 5.1 and my receiver says the resolution is 1920X1080.  I thought that Dolby Vision was automatically 4K.  Oddly on my Sony UBP-X700 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player that also streams Netflix and Prime, Sabrina in Dolby Vision is indeed showing 4K Resolution.  Same Netflix same receiver same LG Oled 55"" TV.  I don't know why this is happening.  However, Jack Ryan on the Firestick 4K also shows in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos and my Receiver verifies it is indeed at 3840 x 2160 4K.  The Roku Ultra plays it at 4K UHD 5.1 NO Dolby Atmos on that box.  Again, I love the Firestick.  Hopefully new updates and improvements to services will fix these little anomalies.",5,1,2018-11-6,1,3,0
"I was transitioning my lovely but tech challenged mother from traditional Cable TV to Play Station Vue. I knew the old PS3 I had was difficult to navigate, even with the remote. I prefer a wired internet connection and had no desire to buy a PS4 as I no longer play games (although tempting). I first set my Mom up on her iPad with the PS Vue app, and used Chromecast to stream it. Worked extremely well - but my mother could not figure out how to cast it and struggles to navigate the iPad (rheumatoid arthritis) as her sense of touch has degraded. (perhaps there is an iPad setting, but I have always avoided Apple products due to Steve Jobs being a deadbeat dad). I digress. I was loathe to go back to cable (only one cable provider in my area), so I went with the Amazon Fire Stick. She is comfortable using it - the simple remote is key. I even bought one for myself and use it too.The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the wireless receiver appears to be weaker than the Chromecast.We experienced intermittent delays when we first switched over from Chromecast, but I moved the wireless router and it works pretty well now. The issue could be on the Sony side -I've researched it and there are a myriad of reasons why it delays. I am not positive it can be blamed on the Fire Stick, but I did not have the issues with Chromecast.",4,1,2019-2-17,1,2,0

Some of the issues I had related to the overall experience, while others related to individual apps. Since this whole thing is a package deal, I see no reason to separate the two. This is the 'Amazon FireTV stick' experience, after all.  Some of the disappointing stuff that I ran into while trying to set it up over Christmas...- Most of the content that is being dangled in front of you is behind paywalls for the various channels.

"I've tried Roku and Apple TV and my built in Smart TV app but none of them provide the combination of highest quality Dolby Vision picture and Dolby Atmos sound capability this unit provides for $35. I have all this working thru my Denon AVR on an LG 2017 OLED TV...The picture and sound quality on Amazon Prime content, as well as, Netflix is truly astounding in full 4k HDR. I have my unit using hard wired ethernet and a FLIRC adapter so it works with my Logitech Harmony Universal remote...everything just works great! As more and more content becomes available not only in 4k but with Dolby Vision or HDR/HDR10 this unit is able to provide such a great picture it makes watching 1080P non-HDR content look like what SD tv looked like compared to HD years ago.....and the Dobly Atmos sound (when available and with a properly configured sound system) makes a very noticeable improvement as well.....I'm not sure about the improvement between the various Dolby Surround/Dolby Plus/DTS/DTSHD/DTS Neural.....BUT Dolby Atmos truly jumps out as a significant improvement. Since this Fire 4K Streamer provides all the latest video and audio standards you don't have to compromise on anything...not even cost...it is almost 5 times cheaper than the Apple 4k unit that frankly was much flakier when it came to being able to deliver the best sound quality from Amazon sourced content. I did have to play around with some of the CEC settings to get reliable Atmos functionality on this Fire unit but once there, this unit is very stable...no shakes, jitters or break-ups. I like Roku stuff but they don't off such a full featured unit meeting all the latest audio and video standards yet in a streamer...and when they do, it will cost more than this Fire Stick I'm sure...at this price it is not worth waiting for another brand to come along...I think at this price and feature set the Fire 4k is a no-brainer.",5,1,2018-11-29,1,2,0
"The video signal is fine, but I’m docking the Fire Stick 4K two stars for not having the ability to adjust the delay on Bluetooth audio. I’m using this in a ceiling mounted projector, so I can’t easily run an audio cable down to my speakers, but the stick’s built-in Bluetooth transmitter has an unwatchably atrocious delay. I could forgive this if there was a way to adjust the relative delay between the video and audio streams, a standard feature on most streaming video devices (and past Fire products), but the feature is conspicuously missing from this product. Despite people clamoring in the forums for a firmware update to address this, Amazon continues to do nothing.In the end, I came up with a convoluted solution involving taking audio out from the Fire Stick 4k’s HDMI port, passing it through the projector to a 3.5mm jack, and from there to a specifically selected Bluetooth transmitter and receiver with aptX Low Latency, and back out to my speakers. The pair of Bluetooth devices cost me about 80 dollars, significantly more than the Fire Stick itself, but it worked.",3,1,2019-8-20,1,3,0
"I recently ordered this fire TV stick in combination with a couple echo dots to dip my toes in the water, and see how I enjoyed the ""Alexa experience."" I'm very pleased! A little backstory--we have a smart TV, though it's not very ""smart."" It just doesn't offer all the apps we want, so I have always used a ROKU device with it. Sadly, I recently broke our ROKU out of sheer clumsiness. I was about to order a new one, but my kids had asked for Alexa for Christmas, so I took a moment to do some research on the array of gadgets that Amazon offers. The fire TV stick and echo dots (on special 2/$50 at the time) were a relatively low risk initial investment before possibly purchasing more devices.First off, the voice feature included on the TV remote works well and accurately. You simply press the microphone button, pause for half a second while the feature activates and then tell it what you want to watch. I took this a step further, however, and connected my fire TV stick with one of my echo dots. That way I can tell Alexa what I want completely hands-free. I just have to specify, ""on fire TV,"" with my command.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,3,0

(The remotes on my previous Fire TV and Roku devices did not.) What really impressed me is that they can be programmed (during the setup process) for multi-device configurations, like if you have a soundbar or receiver that takes care of the audio.

"First of all, I own two of these, and the Fire TV AKA Firestick is a very good device. I highly recommend it overall for all the reasons that many other reviewers are singing its praises. It does many, many things very well. It gets 5 stars for voice recognition, stream quality, and Alexa integration. I love having all my content available on one home screen. Roku does a very good, job as do the other competitors to Firestick, but Amazon's device is clearly the best of the bunch, in my opinion. Though I will say that the others are getting better, too.By the way, a lot of people complain about there being so many advertisements on the Home Screen and other content screens on the Firestick. But I disagree with this. Because it isn't like Amazon is spamming us with ads for dishwashers and outdoor BBQ's lol. They have simply created a huge landscape with tons of channels and content that in many cases I would not have even known about were it not for the ads and icons for them. To me, this is a plus not a minus. I have some minor niggles with the Alexa integration and sometimes the wonky connectivity of either the Firestick remote (in my bedroom) or the Logitech Harmony Elite I use in the living room. BUT these things, in my estimation, are part of the natural evolution of the platform, and they have been getting steadily better since I started using Firestick a few years ago.

"I own 2 Fire sticks and 2 4k Fire sticks.  Overall have loved these devices aside from the barrage of Amazon-pushed ads and inability to fully control what you want to see up front.  However, my most heavily used non-4k stick recently got frozen in a loop of upgrading - stuck mid-way then rebooting and going thru this sequence unending.  I found the extremely difficult to find ""Chat"" section in Amazon where you can chat with a customer service rep.  We tried to trouble shoot with all the reset and factory reset settings - without resolution. Ultimately, the rep got back on the line and said my device is broken and cannot be fixed as it is out of warranty.  I purchased in Nov 2018 and no Jun 2020 it is worthless!  It automatically updates and during this process it died.  He offered me a one-time 15% discount off of a single item sold and shipped by Amazon.  Now I shop constantly on Amazon, using my Amazon Rewards Visa card as many do.  My first thought to replace like for like - but then why would I buy a device which can apparently fail rather easily shortly after the warranty fails?  So I looked at a competing Roku device - ultimately deciding to wait a few months as an updated version was due in the fall.  I also need a new TV, so I researched and selected one (sold and shipped by Amazon) placed it in the cart and no discount was there.So I opened another chat session (a week later) and armed with transcript from previous chat asked why no discount.

Movies grouped in various genres, but they often do not fit the genre they are under.  Moreover, there's no way to drill down and do a smart search within a genre or within the Prime movie library.

I tried every picture and contrast setting on my Samsung 50"" 4k tv, but nothing had the nice quality picture that I get from the Apple TV. The colors are muddy, the contrast is lacking and shows we watch like ""Outlander"", ""Poldark"" or even the nightly news just lacked any luster. I also noticed some difference in the sound quality that my surround system provides, and the Apple TV is noticeably better with the sound separation as well. After 3 days of using the Firestick 4k, I couldn't stand it any longer and went back to the Apple TV. I give 3 stars, but the remote would be 4 stars (it could be better- I like the one on my older Firestick better- smoother feel- this one is not as smooth), and the picture quality would be 2 stars.

Called Amazon and was on the phone for 2 hours with them walking me through everything I had already tried. They finally decided it was defective and told me to bring it back to the store we got it.  They suggested we order it through Amazon instead because it comes preregistered to our account, so we did.  2nd one arrives and starts up, we get connected, and it says it’s downloading an update.

"After the last Fire TV 4K pendant review, I said I would never purchase another Fire TV device. After reading reviews and watching several videos, I decided to give the latest and greatest a try. It does respond faster, but it fails on some features. First, they cut system memory from 2GB to 1.5GB. The device was already lacking as far as system resources were concerned, but I guess that's how they were able to lower the price. My biggest problem with the device is the fact that they advertise that it has Dolby Atmos Sound. But what they DON'T tell you is that the only Dolby Atmos that you can play at the moment is the 8 episodes of their series Jack Ryan! Other providers of Atmos, do not support Atmos in their app (Netflix, although this is Netflix's fault), or isn't even offered (Vudu). To me this is a huge oversight on Amazon's part, and if it was not for the fact that Atmos works on 1 TV show, it would be a blatant case of false advertisement. Another thing that is lacking is the fact that you can not hook up a USB device to play your own content. I use Plex to stream my own content, and it works great, but I shouldn't have to run my computer, along with TV, AV Receiver and Fire Stick just to listen to my music or watch my own movie collection. If Amazon would just add the Vudu app that will run Atmos, I'd give it at least a 3 Star rating. Disappointed, again.",1,1,2019-1-29,1,3,0

I don't have any 4K TV's just 1080P projector and flat screens BUT I discovered the great little 4K fireTV streaming stick works wonderful at 1080P resolution and includes the ability to automatically control my TV and soundbar volume using it's one simple slim remote!I stopped using my NVidia shield and other FireTV box and purchased 2 of these 4K fireTV sticks with updated remotes for both my livingroom and bedroom and can't be happier!",5,1,2018-12-11,1,3,0
"My remote from my older version hit the floor and doesn't work. I wanted to buy a new remote. Told it was not longer available so I'd have to upgrade to the 4k. That sucks, but okay. Well, I have to reset this thing about every other hour. It just Freezes completely, over and over. The upsell was not worth it, not to mention, ALEXA IS ALWAYS LISTENING. I can have a conversation about wanting to buy something with my wife and then the next time I'm online, lo and behold, that product is being advertised on my sidebar. Really Bezos? You're not rich enough? You need to listen in to how you can get more more more!  Get off your butt and save the planet already. You have the means.",1,1,2020-9-18,1,3,0
"The only thing I can use my stick for right now is to see my front and back door cameras everything else are useless. Once I plug it to my ""Samsung one connect"" box, the device keeps on rebooting, which cause my TV to shutoff as well.  It's unfortunate but unless someone has a better experience with the device...  I'm returning it at this time. I haven't heard anything from Amazon about that issue.Today (Feb 5th 2019): I just noticed my review hasn't been submitted which I've submitted about 3 days (1st week of January) after I used the device. I'm posting this now because I'm upset with Amazon. I've read the window to return the device has been closed. I've reported this issue before. The device is useless, since once connected power goes out. Please don't tell me to use a bigger block charger because that is not the issue. I'm not the only one complaining about this. So I need to return the item and get my money back.",1,1,2019-1-7,1,3,0
"I would like to be able to give a better review, but have only my experience to share.I have not been able to get the device to establish a connection. It randomly stops at the initial update, or trying to connect to Amazon. This gives just enough hope it's working to draw you in and keep you going, prompting you to try again. An hour latter, I'm all tried out. It's going back.",1,1,2019-4-16,1,4,0
"Update: I've had the stick for 4 months now. There is 1 big problem. The remote turns itself off after not using it for a few minutes. It saves batteries. Previous models didn't do this & you'd have to change batteries often. Because the remotes are working off Bluetooth instead of infrared like most remotes. The problem with it disconnecting is I sit here every single time hitting buttons. Nothing happens. Takes like 20 or 30 seconds to reconnect. So if I want to pause, I can't when I want to. If I want to play the next episode as the 1st is counting down, I can't. It's great that I am on the same set of batteries, but I had already got rechargeable batteries for my other fire sticks. I'm used to changing batteries every few weeks. Now back to my original review..I have five fire sticks. That's right. You heard me, I have 5. I've retired some. But I have one in each room. I got two of these 4K sticks. I got them on Black Friday. I was under the impression that these particular sticks are faster then the previous model. I was under the impression they were an upgrade and maybe had more features. I think it's fair to say this is not true. In fact like most things these days this newer model is missing features. If you want to screen mirror from your phone, you can no longer do that. It is not any faster. I see no new features. Alexa works the same as it always did. You can still sideload apps obviously. The only major difference is during the setup process, the stick knows what kind of TV you have. It asks you to turn the volume button up & miraculously you can control your TV with it. I can't speak for every TV but I have Sony TVs. The remote will turn the TV on and work the volume. If you are only using the fire TV stick and don't need to switch HDMI ports, than this remote is all you need. That alone makes the stick worth it. You don't need a 4K TV but if you do have one then you can get the 4K. However, if you want the 4K then you have to pay dearly for it. You will have to upgrade your Netflix. Netflix will charge you out the butt. You might see a difference. Reality is, you probably won't. But you'll feel better about it cuz you paid a lot of money and it's telling you you're getting 4K. Personally, I dropped my Netflix down to SD. I only get 480p & it looks just as good as it did when it was 1080. But what do I know? Lol.",4,1,2018-12-13,1,4,0
"The Fire TV Stick 4K works really well, I'm very impressed with the voice recognition. For example, from the home screen I can say ""watch Disenchantment on Netflix"" and will start right up. The same thing can happen with Hulu also. Playback controls with the voice also work great.The biggest downside to this device is the Amazon Fire platform. It's clunky and cluttered and doesn't make sense to navigate. When I go to ""Your Videos"" there is one bar of movies that I own - and it's the SECOND bar. Why not the first bar?? Also, you have to scroll side-to-side to get through all of them, which is too much scrolling for 200+ movies! Everything else is prime video, videos to buy, videos to rent, videos to stream from other services and advertisements. I couldn't find a place to see just my video library without all the other crap thrown in there. It's so obnoxious. There are suggested apps that I've never used or installed - I wish they would just go away. I think what barely passes as an OK touchscreen experience does not translate well to the TV. I'm glad I got it for $25 because I think $50 is too much.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,3,1
I can't believe Amazon did away with mirroring for the new 4k device. What a joke. I would not have bought this had I new that before hand. I will now have to go back to my hold  Stick. More money down the drain for Amazon. Amazon you need to fix this. Bad Robot!,1,1,2019-1-3,1,7,0
"I have to say: I'm pretty impressed with the new FireStick. I previously owned a FireTV 2nd edition, which to this day no other Fire TV seems to hold a candle to, so I have to admit I wasn't expecting much out of this device.I've pretty much tested it into the ground at this point but I'm still no where near complete as I don't have some of the necessary features like Dolby Atmos and an HDR tv to really see what it can do. Even with that being said, I can attest that it does hit the 4k resolution as promised.",5,1,2019-3-24,1,2,0

"I have an Apple TV 4k and a Firestick 4k and the Firestick is constantly crashing and rebooting, most of the main apps keeps crashing or freezing for no reason, and almost every app I use on this device has horrible buffering issues. I wanted the Firestick to replace my Apple TV 4k since I think Apple is overpriced but unfortunately I'm sticking with the Apple TV 4k because I don't have the crashing and buffering issues like I do with the Firestick 4k. I've tried just about every type of troubleshooting solution and the Firestick doesn't cut it for me and I think it's a device that isn't ready for Prime Time just yet. I believe the devs need to get back to work on making the device more stable and less buggy. I wish I could return it but I'm SOL since I bought it at Best Buy and I'm outside of the return window.",1,1,2019-7-20,1,4,0
"Does not currently work for Disney Plus.  Was given as a gift for Christmas after researching and Amazon touted this to work for Disney Plus.  Worked when I set it up at end of December.  Sometime in February quit working and will only ""twirl"" while trying to connect.  Tried everything Amazon told me to do verbally or via the help forum.  Nothing works.  My Roku works no problem on multiple TV's and I can stream on all my Apple Devices via the App and on my PC at Disney+.com.  Therefore the Firestick 4K or it's software is the issue.  Since I did not order it myself I cannot find an easy way to request to return it for a refund. It does work for Prime and Netflix so far with no issues.  I am trying to contact Amazon to return this and if successful I will update this review.",1,1,2020-4-3,1,2,0
"This is not my first Firestick. I still have the old one (moved it to an older tv). I wanted this one because it has the volume control right there on the remote so I no longer have to reach for the tv's remote. However, this Firestick often has problems with losing its connection to my wifi. The reason that i know it's the Firestick and not my wifi is: 1) The old Firestick doesn't encounter this problem;  and 2) In the same tv that i have the new Firestick in,  I also have a Roku box plugged into that same tv. And when the Firestick loses its connection, I can switch over to the Roju and it is still connected and streaming apps just fine. I even tried switching the ports to see if one port has a problem but, no. Whichever port the Firestick is in, it looses its connection to wifi after a couple of hours.I returned one version of this new Firestick because it had the same problems. I just put up with the replacement because I do like the firestick. I just hope eventually they'll have updates that correct the problem.",3,1,2019-7-19,1,2,0
"I have read this from so many reviewers that I'm not sure its worth saying again... but maybe, just maybe, amazon will get it together and fix the issue if we just keep saying it... The wifi in my house is perfectly fine, my ipad/laptop/phone/etc can be in the same room and experience no issues at all, but the firestick will suddenly cut out with an error message about the wifi signal.  I have tried the fix of connecting a longer hdmi cord (apparently this fixes the issue for others - which suggests a serious design flaw in continuing to build this as a ""stick""), but it made it actually made it worse (increasing the frequency of dropped signal errors).  I've found the only fix is to try to connect to another wifi, then reconnect to my own - OR, do a full restart of the device.  Happens about every hour or so.  Very frustrating!",3,1,2019-12-2,1,2,0
"Have a old 42"" Plasma TV in the bedroom, cutting the Comcast able and moving to ATT TV. This Firestick worked great, crazy easy to set-up (if ordered from your Amazon account and used at home it is already configured making it super easy!). At first I did not find the ATT TV app so simply asked Alexa, she took me right to the download page and with a single button push is was loaded in less than a minute. Same for the PBS Kids app that my daughter watches a lot of kids shows on, installed in less than a minute as well. If I knew this was going to work so well I may have skipped the ATT TV box in the living room all together and just used Firestick on every TV. Remote is super simple, intuitive, definitely recommend if you need an easy and cost effective way to make you old TV smart.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,2,0
"Recently purchased the Vizio 55"" M-series Qled tv from Amazon. I've been using Roku devices, and even have a 4k version, and it's an excellent streaming solution. However, Amazon has been improving the Fire line of streaming hardware, and since I've always had positive experiences with Amazon products, I decided to give this 4k streaming stick a chance. Of course it has the major streaming apps (with the exception of Spectrum TV app, but that's more Spectrum's decision, I believe). To be honest, the only apps I'm primarily concerned with are Prime Video, Disney +, Apple TV+ and at some point Netflix and some premium channels. But having access to apps like Pluto, Crackle, etc is welcome, too.Anyway, back to the review of the actual product.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"I have a 55"" LG Smart TV that is barely a year old.  It works great, but there are not a large variety of apps available from the LG storefront.  Thus, I decided to get an Amazon Fire TV.  Since I have a 4K TV I bought the 4K Amazon Fire TV.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.Setup is a breeze.  Simply plug the Amazon Fire TV into an HDMI port on the television.  Attached the included power cord to the Amazon Fire TV and plug it into the power outlet.  Put the two AAA batteries (included) into the remote and your Amazon Fire TV is ready for setup.  To get to this point takes all of a minute (literally).  Next, the on-screen menu walks you through a series of set up prompts such as preferred language, wifi network setup, popular apps to install, cursory Alexa voice recognition training and then your Amazon Fire TV is ready for use.  To get to this point is less than 5 minutes.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0
"Embarrassingly, I did not know how a Firestick worked. It sounded too good to be true, but I decided to give it ago during Prime Day and this little stick converted my dad's old non-4K flatscreen TV into a 4D Smart TV with much-beloved apps like Youtube and Amazonprime without having to purchase a brand new TV! The firestick connects directly to the HDMI port. I purchased one for a TV with a burnt-out HDMI port and I am in the process of figuring out if I can use the firestick with a VGA to HDMI converter for that TV. Will update if it works! If you have been debating this little device a go, I highly recommend.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,3,0

"After an hour of frustration trying to get through the remote control setup for my ViewSonic projector, trying various different IR profile numbers and codes and searching on the web and reviews for answers  I finally called Amazon support through the “call me” feature on the order itself. That was great and they called me right away and connected remotely to my $25 fire tv stick 4K (half price on Amazon day) to trouble-shoot and eventually came to the conclusion that the fire stick Remote is not compatible with any projectors. In other words you can’t control the volume (and I guess a couple other things such as on/off) with it. Not the end of the world for me since I plan to hook the sound up to a sound bar or receiver eventually anyway (and I can always use the projectors remote for the projector volume/mute/on/off) but it’s more remotes to juggle and it was VERY  frustrating that the fire stick setup FORCES you to configure the remote for volume for some device And projectors are not supported and there is no easy way to bypass that part of the set up. So the workaround is just to lie and say the remote works with a code that it really didn’t work for to get past it. You can come back later to the settings and change it of course.Other beef was that I also had the problem many other people had with prying the back cover of the remote off to install the batteries. I tried several small and tiny screwdrivers but that didn’t work and ended up scratching up the back of my brand new remote. I finally found a razor blade and was able to Wedge that in the crack and pry it open enough to get a little screwdriver in there to get it all the way open. Obviously a design/manufacturing flaw that’s not easy to change now for Amazon but  I never had that much trouble putting batteries in hundreds of other remotes...",4,1,2019-7-20,1,1,0
"We received an email informing us that our smart Vizio TV will no longer support The built in Amazon Prime app (it’s 6 years old).  Amazon kindly gave us $25 off the purchase of this stick.  I was under the impression this stick would simply allow me to continue streaming Prime on my TV but it is SO much more!!  It can be programmed as a universal remote which is great for us in eliminating a TV and surround sound remote!  The voice activation is amazing and works with either device (turn on surround sound...and my receiver powers up)!!  We stream Netflix too and no longer use our TV’s built in apps because the user interface of this stick is simply far superior!!  My only gripe...and it’s a big one is in regards to Netflix.  When “hovered” over a show, a mini trailer begins to play.  My wife and I were only on season 3 of a series...but the trailer that began to play was from the current series.  In a matter of 7 seconds of us scrambling to grab the remote...2 MAJOR spoiler alerts were revealed.  Sooooo disappointing.  Wish this feature could be toggled...so be aware!!",4,1,2019-8-16,1,2,0
"Used it in my 5th Wheel on a wifi hotspot and it worked flawlessly. The Alexa it made a few errors, but can be overlooked.UPDATE: I love this thing so much, I bought 7 of them, for different areas of my house and 5th wheel. Paired with a mobile router, there was absolutely the best picture and 0 latency issues. BTW Fubo.tv has the best price and only was lacking 2 channels, being ABC and CW. CW has been added, and we get ABC from a not to be named relatives fiber account. Fubo.tv is $55 as of this writing and includes 3 concurrent streams and 500 hours of DVR, surpassing all of the other ""Brand named"" streaming services we looked into, with more available channels, streams and DVR size. If you  have Netflix you can add that to your home page list, as well as any other apps you use to view shows. Downside Alexa only works with prime and the major apps. it won't for me anyway pull up anything inside the fubo app, will just take me to the app itself. It will however list hulu for shows, so was disappointed they don't do the same for Fubo. Most streaming service don't include ABC just for info. Hulu does, since it's owned by Disney.  So on Amazons part, must get a kickback for having Alexa find shows within hulu and not Fubo. normal course of business I guess.",5,1,2019-9-5,1,1,0
"At first I was happy with Amazon FireTV, now I'm about to throw it away. I do NOT pay for advertisements. Ever. I waited for Hulu until they had no advertisements. Amazon has slowly pushed in advertisements all over the FireTV. And now, the screen saver that would catch every visitors attention and spark conversation has gotten commercials like every couple of images. Are you kidding me? This is a deceitful business practice. They did the same thing with their tablets charging money so you could disable advertisements on your lock screen. Infuriating. Now with Disney+ coming out, which looks amazing, and not being supported on FireTV, I'm sure I'm looking for a better alternative.I was already unhappy that there is such load clicking sounds coming from the remote, it sounds like one of those dog training things. I was unhappy they added a live television menu option at the top of the screen. I was unhappy that they added ad banners all over their video menus that expand and play noise when you move around. I was wondering unhappy when the thing started bugging out and would keep as content overlayed while you were navigating. The screen saver changes just pushed me over the edge.",1,1,2019-10-23,1,1,0

They really don't care about the customer, this is just another profit center for one of the richest companies in the world.  What a shame.I have this connected to a Fire TV Recast dvr.  I bought it so I could ditch cable tv.  The Firestick used to have its own section that displayed your live over-the-air tv channels along with a link to the tv guide.

Big improvement over the old Fire Stick that we replaced. Our old Fire Stick was about 5 years old and had served us well but we started having issues with it so we ordered the new 4K version.We were having issues streaming TV programs.

That includes the highest resolutions including 4k and is compatible with 1080P and yes they have some offerings in standard resolution as well.The huge enchilada is that you get free one and two day shipping.

The 4K stick is faster than the HD model and the TV power and volume control are really nice. I like it better than the HD version with 2 exceptions:  It does not recognize my HDMI ports on my 4K TV as being HDCP 2.2 compliant.  I can watch 4K prime videos with the prime app that is on the TV but not through the Fire Stick 4K.  I have verified with the TV manufacturer that the HDMI ports are HDCP 2.2 compliant but the fire stick says no.  Bummer!! I will try a different HDMI cable but don't believe it will make any difference.  The other problem is somewhat minor.  The live video picture and sound will play in the corner window when scrolling through even though I have the settings turned off so the video and sound is not supposed to play.  Netflix has the same issue except I can't find any setting to turn it off.  Otherwise it is a good product.,4,1,2019-8-3,1,2,0

In addition a TCL TV which has Roku built in.  Having some experience with them all and previous use with Chromecast, I prefer the Fire Stick and the Roku app.My biggest complaint with the Fire Stick is that they seem to just wear out over time.  For example I had a HD version (not 4K) that began to take a long time connecting with the internet.  Once connected everything moved ever so slowly.  It still works but I retired it to the closet.  My first 4K Fire Stick also became glitchy after a couple years.  I couldn't get it to synch with my TV and Receiver.

"Update: The new PS4 Dualshock controllers with a lightbar in the touchpad will sync and work, but there's a bit of a lag issue with button response, making a lot of games unplayable.Not compatible with Amazon's own game controller or any other that you link to it. This includes PS4, Xbox One via Bluetooth and wired with an OTG cable. It will recognize it as a generic game controller, but it won't do anything. The Fire TV Stick 4K is programmed to block the inputs, even from the official Amazon game controller. Fun fact: In the Fire TV Stick 4K, when you open a game it tells you that no controller is detected, would you like to buy one now? If you select yes it takes you to the official Amazon page to buy their gaming controller, but won't let you purchase it. In the description of the official Amazon gaming controller it states that it does NOT work with the Firestick 4k. The Fire TV Stick 4K will however let you spend all the money you want on games that you can't play without a controller. There are tutorials online on how to install unofficial, untested apps at your own risk, and try and get other controllers working, but they can break your Fire TV Stick 4K, and have the potential to open up your network to all sorts of malware and viruses.

"I upgraded from first gen 4K boxes to the 4K sticks to get better x265 support in Plex and really for no other reason.  And in that, they work great.  There are just a few codecs the built in Android Exoplayer can't handle properly.  I can stream 4K 10 bit HDR no problem in directplay, but as mentioned, every once in a while I come across something it can't play like a video with AAC that it needs a transcode for.  The GUI is snappy although like all Fire TVs it is very convoluted.  Everything is missed together, live TV, Prime premium channel subscriptions, recommendations installed apps, all mixed in with pay VOD content and recommendations for other app downloads and purchases.  I would prefer a way to organize the home screen to display the content I want in the order I want, just as live TV on the top row and then apps etc.But the bigger problem I am having with the stick is the lack of storage.  The box has microSD so when I would toss on downloaded RPGs like Ys 1 + 2, Final Fantasy or other games like the Genesis collection, the stick quickly fills and then you are bombarded with notices of being low on memory, with the only recourse being to delete content you have paid for.  Even on a stick, there should be a microSD slot, especially if they want to push game games on users.",2,1,2018-12-28,1,2,0
"I have used Chromecast, Nvidia Shield TV, Apple TV, Roku and they all have their plus and minuses. Recently I purchased the Fire TV Stick 4K with the hopes to have a device that supports all the HDR (HDR10, Dolby Vision, HDR10+) formats and also gives me Dolby Atmos support and reliable performance. There is no device on the market that currently supports all these formats in one box. NONE. I have been impressed so far. The only problem I see is there is no resolution matching available but I think that is a software thing. I do like that they have frame rate matching though. After using it for a few weeks and adding the Fire TV Recast, it's a no brainer for cord cutters who are already comfortable with the FireTV interface and enjoy the heavy focus on Alexa integration. I look forward to adding the Echo Link Amp when it comes out to have an even better experience. Highly recommended.Only major nitpick is, no resolution matching, all content will display in 4K or 4K upscaled.",4,1,2018-11-15,1,4,0
"Bought it because I read that you can use Alexa echo dot with it to turn TV off and on but it doesnt.  Setting it up to work with the echo dot is not easy and I still have not figured it out.  So to me this is not the hands free device I was led to understand it could be.  Remote that comes with it recognizes command to turn the tv off and on but when you tell Alexa using echo dot the same thing, she does not recognize the TV device.  Alexa on echo dot does not recognize any fire stick command.  Very frustrating when this should be easy.Streaming is ok but I was able to do that without the firestick through my TV apps.  I also cannot figure out how to get my local channels without switching to my cable so I cannot cut off cable TV either.",3,1,2019-8-18,1,2,0
"I just got this thing in today and let me tell you that I am happy with my purchase. Before I continue let me just say that the blue ray player that I am using is an out dated model for Amazon Prime. Amazon will no longer be available for me on my blue ray player after 9/26/19 so they generously sent me a $25 discount on any of their fire sticks available. Even their cube. The Fire TV streaming stick (with Alexa built in, 4K Ultra HD, Dolby Vision, Includes the Alexa Voice Remote) was fairly more expensive (although not by much) and went on sale for $34.99 - $25 comes to $10.69. So I immediately jumped on it and ordered it. For under $11 I am having the time of my life with this thing. It works so damn well and much better than I could imagine or had hoped it would. With a good indoor antenna I can watch my local channels. With this fire stick I complete my television watching experience. I thank Amazon so much for their generosity because they did not have to do that. I can now watch my shows on my television in the clearest of quality. My Sony Bravia never looked so good. And, if I want to know the time, I just hold down the speaker button and say ""Time"" and Alexa tells me the current time, and the weather if that is what I ask for. It is an easy set up and as long as you have an HDMI input it will work flawlessly. I don't have a 4K and that does not matter. So if you read this and your HDTV is a little out dated, don't worry about it. It'll work for you too. Get it. You will be glad you did. I guarantee it. Besides, my sister has a 4K Visio and my 120 Hz 41"" Sony Bravia looks better than hers. But, it is a Sony!Buy this. I have broken away from cable for the second time and now with this, the cable king is dead and buried! Why pay so much for channels I will never watch? And to a company that will raise their prices any time they want and there is nothing you can do about it and they know it. That is why they are so arrogant about it. I come from the time when color TV was new. We did not pay to watch television at that time. The most you had to worry about was someone stealing your roof antenna. Now, with an internet connection - that we need anyway - and a fire stick, you are good to go. So Go!",5,1,2019-9-26,1,1,0
"They need to stop advertising this as supporting Atmos - it does not!  Perhaps with the perfect combination of TV and planetary alignments you might get it to work occasionally but you’ll need medication for the hypertension you’ll suffer for that fleeting periodic satisfaction.  If you’re considering this for that purpose, go visit the Amazon forums to browse the horror stories...On top of that issue, I’ve had repeated problems with crashing and buffering and movies stopping in the middle of playing for 5-10 minutes (this is with the added Ethernet hard wired dongle).",1,1,2019-12-1,1,2,0
"Last night we were looking to watch a movie.  We selected one ""recommended"" by Amazon.  After clicking on the selection there was no indication of any price for watching and we started the movie.  Midway through, the movie was cut off and when we went back into the movie, now we were given 2 methods (both requiring that an app be installed on our TV) in order to continue to watching for free.  In lieu of this, there was an indication at rental would be the usual rate of $2.99 for 48 hours or we could purchase it for $9.99.  Just to try, we installed one of the apps, and immediately we were exposed to a commercial ad to which none of the usual Firestick commands for fast forward or reverse would work, before the movie would continue ""for free"".  Shame on you Amazon, for using this type of trickery.  AS A PRIME CUSTOMER, I WOULD  HAVE EXPECTED BETTER, MORE UPFRONT AND HONEST TREATMENT THAN THIS.",1,1,2019-8-15,1,2,0
"I actually like the user interface better than Roku. It has nice colors, seems a little more HD than Roku even though I only have a 1080p TV. The voice is nice to have. But here's where Fire TV Stick got it wrong: A male HDMI connector juts awkwardly out of the Stick.. the only way to connect is to stick the Stick itself right into your TV; no using your existing HDMI cables, which are male to male. Given how long the Stick is, 6 inches or so, that could be awkward if your HDMI ports point toward the wall and there's not a 6"" space.On my TV, the HDMI ports are slightly recessed and point downward – so I had to use Amazon's included female-to-male VERY short HDMI adapter. The female end goes on the Stick, and the male end into your TV. Once again, even the adapter only renders your Stick a slightly longer male connector. There's never any way to use your standard HDMI cable from TV to Stick. My Roku is has a female HDMI port, so it wins.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
"I love the new Fire TV stick with Alexa voice remote it is great and much better than the last generation. The only problem is trying to open the remote control to put the batteries in which is a complete nightmare. It is not easy and it took me about 30 minutes to open it. Amazon needs to fix this because it can be frustrating and I had to watch some Youtube videos on how to open this remote, but they didn't help me and ultimately I used a box cutter to gently pry open the remote slightly and then push up to open. I hope these batteries last a long time lol. If anyone knows an easier way to open it please let me know.",5,1,2019-3-31,1,3,0
"What good is a high-tech, 4K, circa 2018 device if you can't get the remote open? Further, if the remote is impossible to open, why aren't the batteries already in it? Why does this device not come with Gorilla Tape included to help get the remote open? I'm not even done hooking this thing up, and it's already getting a 1 star review because Amazon created such a brilliant impression with their impressive and simplistic packaging, and allowed that to contrast against engineering a remote that simply can't be opened. I think Google figured out why they can ask for more for a Chromecast, that doesn't have a remote, and still make more money than Amazon. No remote, or one that opens.",1,1,2018-12-21,1,4,0
"After using the Firestick for about 2 weeks, we are ditching our Cable company.  Gone are the nights of having 600 channels and nothing interesting or inviting to watch - there are ALWAYS cool things to watch with Firestick.  We get our local channels, favs, and can pick a la carte what channels we wanted all along.  Fans of PBS please note that PBS does not as yet stream so that is sadly unavailable to date, and there are premium channels that require a subscription.  For the most part, we have used the channels included in our Prime membership and have stumbled onto great shows we didn't know existed.  This system is easier to install than most Cable systems, the picture is much clearer, we don't lose the signal during bad weather.  I don't know why we waited so long.  Cut our bill from $180 to $45 a month.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,2,0
I love the savings that I’m getting switching from Xfinity to Firestick paired with a local internet service. I was paying 46% more for cable internet service with 100 fewer cable channels.Firestick offers a feee iso app that works fairly well for using your own keyboard to enter passwords user names and search features.,4,1,2019-6-24,1,3,0
I have not had a lot of time to use the firestick 4k.  But I will say that it is significantly faster then the original firestick I bought back in 2016.  The original one had become so slow it was basically unusable.  The 4k version is just as fast as my Roku Streaming stick +.  I also like the fact that it can turn on and off my tv where as the original would not.  It basically set itself up which was a bit unnerving.  It pulled my WIFI password from my account which I did not expect.  Not really sure if that's a good or bad thing.  I was on the fence about buying 1 but decided to buy it when they dropped the price to $25.00 with a code.  As of right now I am happy with the purchase and would buy another if I needed it.,5,1,2019-10-15,1,2,0
Device does not easily identify which titles are prime/paid content. The app built into my visio TV highlights each title that is prime with a tag so you can easily see if it's going to cost you extra money to watch it while you are scrolling and browsing for movies/shows. This fire stick doesn't have any prime title identification what so ever throughout the browsing menu so you have to click on each and every single movie/show to find out whether or not it's going to cost you extra money to watch it. This is clearly not an oversight. It's a bait and switch ploy to try and get people to pay more money for movies and shows that aren't 'free' readily watchable prime content.,1,1,2018-11-23,1,4,0
"I only bought this because amazon sent me an email saying they were soon discontinuing support of their video app on my Panasonic smart tv, and it's already been doing strange things, like saying I don't have an internet connection when I do or that I'm not a prime member when I am. I don't care much for American tv, or tv in general, and only watch youtube and free prime member videos on the tv and use a vpn to watch the iplayers in my own country on my tablet or watch my own dvds.  I'm planning to return there as soon as I can anyway, and I got enough of a credit that this cost me under $17, so I'm making do with this until then. I don't know a lot about what apps are available and care even less.I've only had this for about a week, and these are some of the things that I hate about it.  The home screen is cluttered with all sorts of things I don't want,including things I've already watched or decided against, and I haven't found a way to delete them like I can on my tv app, which has always been uncluttered by unnecessary things. There's no search on it that you can type into like there is on my tv app. Talking to it often gets the wrong thing or it doesn't understand what I want at all.Even going into the prime video app where I know what I'm looking for exists, telling it what I want more often than not takes me to some other obscure app that I've never heard of that I have to instal and almost everything has to be paid for, or if not, there's advertising. There's an episode list in my tv app that is much easier to read, find, and navigate than big photos with small hard to read words at the top like on this fire stick. That's one of the reasons why I cancelled netflix. One of the biggest things is that my tv has a no signal shutoff that works with my tv apps and with my dvd player, but not with the fire stick, so it would stay on forever if I didn't switch it off myself. That's how I get to sleep when I do, to fall asleep watching something. The only improvement to my smart tv is that I could watch something on my web browser that wasn't supported on my tv. If this wasn't a cheap temporary thing for me, I would have probably looked into alternatives more than I did.",1,1,2019-8-2,1,1,0
This device was very easy to hookup and with an Amazon account it almost sets it self up for streaming and gives you quick access to Amazon Prime moves and more plus 4K output is great over all. I did find that in order to get the best results from 4K movies and videos some picture tweaking gave some of the good 4K stuff the wow factor. I have found not all movies and videos exhibit the same quality that I would like to see but this is not a fault of the fire stick but the way the movies were made or upscaled to become 4k. Going to Your Tube and playing some of their 4k videos was a great way to calibrate the tv settings to match the fire stick. Watching videos there especially Sony 4K was absolutely amazing and even standing a foot or two from the TV revealed definition and color so real that it looked like the subjects were just out side a very clean window. Wow factor! The TV that is currently using this is a Samsung  UN55JS8500 Ultra HD which is now showing off it's colors and then some! There is also a few tweeks you can do on the Fire TV stick to which will enhance your viewing. All together Congratulations Amazon! Great product!,5,1,2018-11-24,1,2,0
Product works great but batteries were dead. And the hdmi cord extender was not in the box. I called customer service and they were going to issue me a new one. I asked if I would be able to use this one until the new one came. She said yes. 2 minutes after the phone call the fire stick cut out.I called back and he said that’s what happens. So I said cancel the new one and I will keep this one with out the extended and having to use my own batteries.,3,1,2019-11-27,1,2,0

We have 3 tv's (2 smart tv) and we put a fire stick on each tv.  We had free trials on all the service provides and went with Hulu and Amazon Prime.  We tried 'Sling"", but it does not pick up the local channels (CBS, ABC, NBC) without using an antennae.... well... that was more than buying another fire stick.  Hulu does connect with your local tv stations.  You cannot watch the same program on two different tv's - but not a problem for us.

"I previously had the Amazon fire box which worked fine, so I ordered the new Fire stick with Alexa and volume control on remote... TERRIBLE problems losing internet connection constantly, tried moving it to upstairs tv where router is, and it did not do any better. And design is stupid, requires the extender/ internet enhancer in order to fit, then it hangs all wonky from HDMI plug, had to tape it in place. Do love the volume control on remote though.  I Returned the fire tv stick for fire tv box/ pendulum, no problem with internet connection, but there's no volume control on remote. My biggest beef is that I was told it works with Spectrum but there is no spectrum app offered, so You have to download each channel separately, AND go thru the activation process a couple dozen times, so frustrating and time consuming, ugh! (Then I had to do it all again when I returned and swapped it). Also, there is NO free CBS streaming channel (only CBS all access for a fee, same with Hallmark channel).  Roku has Spectrum app, SO it's MUCH EASIER, ONE DOWNLOAD you get ALL the channels you subscribe to available in one spot... INCLUDING CBS and Hallmark for no extra charge, if they are included with your spectrum subscription.

"I have an 8 year-old plasma HD TV. It's been fine picture quality-wise, but over the years support for various features/apps have been dropped (YouTube, etc.) When Amazon notified me that I would no longer be able to stream Amazon Prime on my TV, I went ahead and got the Fire TV Stick 4k since I didn't feel like buying a new TV to replace a TV that works just fine otherwise.Setup was super easy. Within minutes I was able to get everything going. Streaming movies and music and browsing the internet now works amazingly well. I haven't gone through all of the crazy number of apps available, but the one I have are pretty cool.

"So we bought it in January, and installed it about 3 weeks or so after receiving it. Installing it was fine. We previously had the Gen 1 Firestick on an older Vizio LCD. We only use the firestick on that tv, in our bedroom. We don't have Comcast nor Directv. We bounce between Hulu, Netflix, and Prime. We got tired of bouncing between two remotes, especially just to turn it on and control the volume. When this new stick came out with tv controls, we had to get it. It simplified our lives. The first 6 weeks were fine, and then one night, the tv controls were not working. Not the power, not the volume. The other controls worked fine. I was I easily able to toggle between apps and hit pause, rewind, forward just fine. Upon close inspection, I noticed the volume did work, but I had to be 2 inches from the TV, which makes it useless. However, the next day, it worked fine again. Two weeks later, it did it again. And then a couple days later it happened again. I'm disappointed bc I through out the old tv remote, and this ""glitch"" only happens late at night. So I've had 3 nights already where I've had to get up and turn off the tv late at night. I regret throwing out the old tv remote. Now I worry, when is the next time this will happen?",3,1,2019-4-3,1,2,0

"Original Review - Frequent updates cause lock ups creating need to restart device.Updated - 07/27/2019, received call from Amazon support regarding my review and concerns.  Gentleman was very professional and sought to remedy issues.  Helped with some issues though nothing regarding my original concerns were resolved.  To be fair, I did not have time to work with him on an extensive troubleshooting process but I changed my review from 2 to 3 stars based on concern and outreach by Amazon.  If my issues don’t continue, I will update again to improve score but right now, too many updates and was very frustrating in that I had to basically unplug it and re plug it in to get it to come back to life.  Amazon support was top notch.  He knew he caught me at a bad time and followed up via email with a direct line to troubleshoot the issue further.  That being said, when I buy a product, especially because Amazon pulled support for my Sony dream system, I am not happy to spend any of my personal time “fixing” issues I never had before I was forced to switch to a new device, I had to pay for so I could continue to access a service I was already paying for, with the added hindered effort of yet another weak link to accessing my home network.",1,1,2019-8-26,1,1,0
"I originally purchased this in November 2018, after purchasing the original Fire Stick about a year earlier. After a year and a half (March 2020), I started experiencing connection problems. It would randomly drop the connection for no reason. I originally chalked it up to the internet connection, but I was able to stream on my computer and my original Fire Stick.I have now used my original Fire Stick for the last 5 months until it too also stopped working correctly. While I SOMEWHAT understand the original Fire Stick becoming obsolete, I would have expected them to last more than a couple of years. I am now replacing both with a new Fire TV 4K only because I have basically no other choice. It's either this or Roku, which I recently purchased and it doesn't give me the apps I need. I'm taking the Roku back and purchasing 2 Fire TV's, again, only because I don't have other options. I'm really not happy that this only lasted a little over a year.

"I have had the regular fire stick for a while now with absolutely no problems and when I got a new 4K TV last month you could tell the picture could be better when streaming my Sling TV.  So I quickly went and ordered this version to match my TV.  I was super excited to get it and get it all set up.  And for a few days it was perfect.  Less than a week later I noticed this white line along the bottom of my screen.  This line was not there with my blu-ray, video game systems, or when streaming on the TV's installed apps.  Only when I streamed something thru the Fire Stick.  So I tried everything with the stick I could think of to get rid of it.  I switched HDMI ports, I restarted it (numerous times), put it to sleep, checked the video settings, you name it I tried it.  Nothing worked so I went to Amazon for help.  And the lady was helpful.  She didn't actually do anything, but the line disappeared so I counted that as a win.  I was once again excited.  Until, yet again, a few days later the line came back.  So once again I spoke to someone from Amazon.  They sent me a replacement and it came fast.  Yup, I was excited all over again.  Unfortunately, as soon I started this new one up the damn line came back.  This time within minutes.  I'm just so frustrated because with the non 4K fire stick I didn't have this problem but I also didn't have the quality.While Amazon support was definitely helpful and fast, I guess I'm just going to have to deal with this line because I don't know what else to do.",3,1,2018-12-16,1,2,0

"There is a bunch of very bad advice in the other questions and in reviews. This 100% works on 1080p TV, no do not need a 4k TV to use this version. It does future proof your purchase a bit and there is literally no reason what so ever to get the regular HD version. This was for a second TV and my house, we've all gotten pretty use to using only this device to watch TV and wanted the updated remote with volume control. I thought that the volume control would actually run on the fire tv and create variable output on the HDMI, but it actually configured the IR on the actual TV and run the native volume, this is important if you have an alternative audio source. I am not sure if the Fire could control the variable output method, it just seamlessly configured this way, which is what I wanted. Only downside is you have to point the remote at the TV because it uses IR, as opposed to the rest of the remote feature that has a non-directional wireless connection.In terms of the set-up, I had to use the enclosed power cord and I couldn't use the USB on the TV, a bit annoying because it is just one more thing I need to plugin. The system actual started with the TV USB connection, but then told me it needed more power, I assume the TV has a lower USB 2 power, and this needs USB 3.  The included HDMI extender was required for me just because of how the inputs are arranged on my TV, needed a little extra angle. This dongle was included.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,1,0

This year, 2019, I got the opportunity to purchase the 4K Fire Stick for $25 during the Prime Day Sale. I was pretty much ordering for the deal, thinking I could always find a use for this thing if I didn't love it. The device came in a day or two later, and I wanted to see how it all worked from start to finish. First off, the setup is so much simpler than anything else I have used. I loved the fact that it found my sounder and was able to program to it without any effort on my part. This is a huge leg up over Apple devices. After setup it was easy to add applications. I added everything I needed and started trying all my streaming licenses on the Fire Stick.Quality is fantastic, everything works as it should.

Honestly, they've all done what they were supposed to do so much better than Chromecast or Roku ever did but the thing that really annoyed me into even writing a review is that in the newest version of the firestick they took away screen mirroring. That is, the ability to cast from your phone or anything not owned by Amazon to your firestick is gone. That means no casting spotify to your screen or an app from your phone or a tab from Chrome unless you have a smart tv that can do it for you. Sure there's a workaround with AirScreen but I don't really get why they'd remove that functionality in the first place. I'm so used to getting annoyed sitting at my computer or having headphones in that I just cast to my tv so I can take a break not being able to do that hit me harder than I thought it would. Otherwise though, it's a great product. I can't say I've ever really had problems with the fire stick outside of this one.",3,1,2019-3-24,1,2,0
"I appreciate the video streaming features of this device with my 1080p flat-panel TVs--I have chosen not to purchase UHD-TV, since the differences are barely noticeable at normal viewing distances. I bought this in the effort to future-proof our viewing, meaning I don't know how long reasonable-quality 1080p TVs will remain available and affordable now that UHD is becoming popular.Having made comparisons between the two (HDTV and UHD-TV) I decided my existing HDTVs are fine for the present--as a hobbyist artist/painter I do appreciate the fine texture of UHD displays, but find that without getting closer than most of us actually do when viewing TV, the UHD doesn't offer significantly more in the overall TV-watching experience than my current HDTVs. The advantage might come when viewing in projecting a 12-foot diagonal (or larger) image on a screen, as in a theater. Pixels can be seen if viewing from two or three feet away when viewing the 1080p projected image.  (Incidentally, the digital projectors at the multi-screen cinema in our town are all 1080p, and no one complains at the quality!) As most TV and projection experts who have compared discernible image quality differences in the two resolutions have said, the biggest factor in the perception of image quality is related to image CONTRAST.",3,1,2019-11-26,1,1,0
"We purchased this on a Black Friday sale in order to be able to watch Disney+ without having to cast from my iPhone all day and kill the battery (my toddler is obsessed with Pixar films and with these winter storms, we're stuck inside a lot) and so far I'm very impressed. We had a second generation Apple TV and it had met all our needs until now but by comparison it streamed super slow, hung up all the time, had no live TV, and in general was starting to show its age. The only two places I've found it to be superior were the fact that the older Netflix app did not force me (or more importantly my toddler, who frequently grabs the remote) to watch a full-sound preview for any movie we happen to rest our ""cursor"" on for more than an instant, and I could use a remote app on my phone to quickly type passwords or override my kid's maniacal button-clicking. Otherwise the Firestick wins hands down! Much more customizable interface, I was able to stop automatic video previews for every app except Netflix, parent controls were clearly extolled and easy to find, videos play almost instantly and in great quality without any change to our internet, and it's lighting fast to switch between apps. The remote controlled both our ancient hand-me-down plasma TV and brand new sound bar with almost zero setup and they all work seamlessly together from only the one Firestick remote. I swear there's twice as many programs on the apps I already had and new apps that work great for free. I was pleased to find the Apple Plus app did in fact let me watch iTunes content I had purchased from my Apple TV; I really hadn't been expecting that. And it turns out that all this time my Stars subscription under Prime would have gotten me multiple live channels, only the Apple TV never showed me an option for that. It was front and center on the Firestick and now I'm watching lots of neat programming I didn't know I could get. Suddenly my subscription seems a lot more valuable....In short, a great product that I wish I'd switched to much sooner!",5,1,2019-12-10,1,1,0
"Why are there many YouTube videos on how to open the fire stick remote battery cover?  Why, when you search google, does one get hits of people asking how to open the remote battery cover.  Amazon does include a special instruction on how to open the remote battery cover.  One may ask why this is needed in the first place?  Every remote I have ever used it was obvious how to open the battery cover.  It was easy.  But nooo,  not Amazon Fire Stick.  Why all the YouTube videos on how to open the battery cover? Because 1) The included Amazon instruction DOES NOT WORK, follow it and you will probably end up destroying the remote, and 2) it takes a very special trick using rubber gloves or scotch tape to get it open the first time.  I'm nor making this up.  It's too ridiculous to make up!  Watch the YouTube videos.  This may be a great device but they get a zip rating if one can't use it because you can't get the battery cover open.  Buy ROKU or Apple TV and you will be much happier.",1,1,2019-3-6,1,2,0
Definitely a step up from the previous models. I don't really use the voice recognition so I can't really comment on that. One thing that does really annoy me is there are times when the remote just won't work. To make it work I would have to change the source then change it back to HDMI and then it would start working again. I don't know if it's just a defect are the remote that I have but both my fire sticks have the same problem. Other than that the works great and it does what it needs to.,4,1,2020-4-25,1,3,0
"I love how easy setup is on the Amazon Fire stick.  The best setup feature, in my opinion, is how the unit integrates with both my TV and audio system.  The power button on the Fire TV Stick powers the TV and the audio system on simultaneously.  This is a great feature and now I rarely use either of the other remotes for the TV or the sound bar with subwoofer.  I remember the old days where you had to look up codes in the manual and try three or four codes to get remotes to sync with TVs, etc.  Not with the Fire Stick.  The setup is super easy!  Voice recognition is fantastic...just tell it want you want to watch or listen to and BAM! Alexa delivers it to you on screen.  I have stopped using my TVs integrated smart-tv menu and switched 100 % over the Fire Stick.  Amazon has done a great job with this technology.",5,1,2019-9-2,1,3,0
"I bought about a year or so, and have been using it sparely on my living room TV.  For weeks mow it started having connection issues... I've contacted Amazon on several occasions by online help, with no avail! They had me walk thru all types of troubleshooting, with the end results being the same! So today, I tried talking over the phone  with an associate only to have to jump thru the same ole hoops! All I was wanting was a replacement!!! Not a refund, nor return, a replacement! While jumping thru said hoops, the issues were still there! The CSR told me to wait 24 hrs, and she'll call back and see if its working okay then, if not then she would check into a replacement??? Okay, I'm on the phone with you right now with it having issues and you won't replace it, but tomorrow you might?? I have two other fire sticks that I've never had any problem with, just this one! And I hoped Amazon would replace it and they wont! Like I stated earlier, It would be different if I was seeking a refund, but I was only wanting a different unit, heck even a lesser model non 4k I would have been happy with... Its disappointing that Amazon would not stand by a product that bares their brand on it!!! And after being a prime member for years, and dealing with something like this makes me rethink my membership! So I do plan on buying another fire stick, ( not thru Amazon ) because I like the product and when it works its great! I will end up tossing this one in the trash, and taking the $40 dollar loss...  I just always thought Amazon was better than this!!!",1,1,2020-3-14,1,1,0
"Let me first say that my attitude toward the Fire Stick if biased. My rural TV cable company is forcing me to streaming, taking their HiDef channels off of cable and, if I want TV (as I am outside of reliable broadcast reception area in this mountainous area) offering me a streaming package of their g'zillion TV and movie channels. ""We recommend Fire Stick since Ruku doesn't seem to integrate well with our service."" The told me. ""Since we have wired 95 percent of our customers with fiber optic to home service, streaming TV instead of maintaining copper makes economic sense and provides better TV service. I am one of the 5% not on fiber and not programed to be in the near future. My Internet is DSL and my wired phone is Voice Over.  While I am paying for ""...up to 10GB..."" I have 6 on a good day. I can stream a local or news channel or an occasional movie (my usual fare) and wait for my computer to paint the screen, or I can turn off TV and have a responsive computer (OneDrive takes continual bandwidth). None of this has to do with how good Fire Stick is. But I would sure rather have my 4-tuner TiVo on a separate TV link than the beautiful TV picture that the Fire Stick paints. I would like to be able to fast forward live TV through commercials (after I have backed up or paused the signal with the Fire Stick with a button or with assistance from Alexa. I wish recording and playback and turning on closed caption and other familiar controls were less stodgy. If I had chosen to avoid paying for cable and TV and just stream the channels I want, I would likely love the Fire Stick. Since I am forced to go to Fire Stick and have to pay even more every month to watch the same few TV channels I always watched on cable, I am less enthusiastic about Fire Stick than I ought to be.",3,1,2019-8-17,1,2,0
"I first ordered regular firestick for my non 4k tv and I liked it. So I ordered 4K firestick for my Sony XBR Bravia ""4K"" TV.But it keeps showing in 1080 only. So I contacted service chat and they transfer me to Tech. Support.",1,1,2019-7-21,1,3,0
"Apparently, the selling point on the Fire Stick are voice recognition and Alexa integration, but since I haven’t used either of these features, this review evaluates how well the device streams TV and movies (which I believe is it’s actual purpose). The answer is “Ok”, but it’s many, many other problems outweigh the good picture quality and availability o& channels.Let’s start with the pros:",2,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
"Forget searching the web or Youtube or Prime movies by punching letters on your remote one at a time or scrolling through scores of onscreen apps.  Simply say ""play Superstition by Stevie Wonder"" or ""play John Denver live"" or ""how much is Paul McCartney worth"" or ""how many times has Mick Jagger been married"" or ""when is high tide at Bodega Bay"" or ""when was the last California earthquake"" or play KCBS radio"".  This thing is nothing short of amazing!  Amazon needs to provide more stars to rate this gizmo!  If you are wringing your hands over whether to get this thing just stop it.  Do it!  Do it now!",5,1,2018-11-24,1,3,0
My old fire stick gave up the ghost so I ordered a new one.  It had a couple of nice additions I like.1).  The ability to Customize your Screen Saver with your own photos.  Very nice.  I need to experiment with what size images render the best.  Horizontal are better than vertical orientation.  Large sizes will crop the top on one loop and crop the bottom on the other.  I haven't yet googled for a page that details what sizes render best... still on my eventual todo list.,5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"YOU HAVE TO HOLD A BUTTON DOWN ON THE REMOTE TO ACTIVATE VOICE COMMANDS. Makes me want to scream with frustration how backwards that is. The point of voice activation is INSTEAD OF PRESSING BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE! Then, after holding the mic button and speaking your command, you have to point the remote at the TV, or it might not work too well.  I tried to bypass the remote with Echo dot, but it mostly doesn't work right.  For instance, if you say (to the dot)  Alexa, mute Fire TV, it does indeed mute the TV, but it also switches the input without being asked to do so.  Often have to repeat commands when using the remote itself. And don't try to raise or lower the volume with voice commands-  it continues to raise or lower continuously. If you say to the dot, Alexa raise volume, i will raise one notch and stop, which is nice.Dot integration works well with streaming services, especially netflix.  For some reason it does not seem to recognize 'Open Prime Video' which is baffling given that it's Amazon's own service.  If it played dumb when you asked for anything other than Prime V, I would understand that.  Mostly I wish I had just gone with the plain Fire stick.  Fortunately, I got it half price on Prime day.  Cannot recommend, needs to go back to the drawing board and become an actually voice activated remote i.e. - you speak commands without having to press any buttons and the remote responds. The regular price is as much as a dot already, and I don't care how big it is or heavy, I wouldn't be moving it if it worked right.",3,1,2019-7-20,1,1,0
"UPDATE 8/6/2020: Amazon has called to follow up based on my negative review, and once again is trying to get me to spend my time to try to correct this corrupt device. I told the rep (this is my 5th request!) that I want the device REPLACED. The fire stick has already proven to be corruptable. Why a BILLION dollar industry like Amazon can’t simply send me a replacement device that costs them $2 to produce, I have no idea. I’m shocked that Amazon is being so unreasonable and cares so little for my peace of mind. I DON’T WANT THEIR HIJACKED INSECURE DEVICE HOOKED UP YO MY WIFI. REPLACE IT, AMAZON.Original post 8/3/2020: Device arrived, set up (not my first Fire Stick. Replacing the older, slower model). Worked great for 2 days.

"UPDATE: Kristina with Amazon's Tech Support Team contacted me within 10 minutes of leaving this review. That alone made me quite happy indeed. Kristina was amazing and very professional, and did everything she could to troubleshoot our issue. While she was not able to get the Hulu app working, she did show us a temporary workaround the issue by mirroring devices. Now that Amazon has done their bit trying to get things to work, I can now go to Hulu tech support, and apply pressure to them to get their app working on my Fire stick.This was our first ever Fire stick we purchased on July 19. The few apps we cared for: Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, and You tube worked great. Then three weeks into using the stick, the Hulu app suddenly quit working: Error 94. We've done absolutely everything recommended and beyond to fix this issue, including tech support with both Hulu and Amazon, and neither party's been able to fix it. Hulu claims Amazon performed an update on their end, so they are getting this complaint from their subscribers. Amazon tech support said they'd escalate my complaint to higher tech and I should be contacted, but that hasn't happened yet. So now we are disappointed with this product, which we purchased to replace our Sony blu-ray player because that will no longer support Hulu.",3,1,2019-8-23,1,2,0
"My old Fire Stick lacked volume control buttons so I always had to have my cable box or TV remote close at hand.  During Prime Day, I bought the newer/faster/better 4K version which eliminated that problem.  As claimed, the 4K Fire Stick is faster and more powerful.  Unfortunately, the new remote was clearly designed for people with small hands.  Despite adding 3 new audio buttons, the new remote is about 1/2"" shorter with buttons so closely spaced that a normal thumb press to land on more than one button at a time.  Amazon also reduced the depth of the index finger depression on the back of the remote - a feature that made the old Fire Stick remote perfectly stable in my hand.  I now have to hold the new remote near the bottom, pressing buttons with just my thumbnail.  It's altogether awkward and hard on my thumb joints.  I can't imagine why Amazon's engineers decided to make the world's smallest remote even smaller but the result was a decidedly inferior user experience.  I hope Amazon's the next generation of remotes solve these problems, perhaps adding a white or silver option so I can find the dang thing when my room lights are turned down.",4,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
"Nothing but issues! The first Fire stick I got came DOA out of the box. It’s was obvious that there was no fixing it but I had to go through all of the call center scripts for a 30 minute phone call to get a new one sent. The new one worked out of the box but has been nothing but problems since. It will constantly buffer even when it’s the only device in the house using the WiFi. It gives me the same notification EVERY SINGLE TIME ITS TURNED ON! I constantly have to re-download apps, reassign the network and/or restart the Fire stick all together to get it to operate normally. A new issue it started having is having the screen saver come on while I’m actively watching something. I bought this because the Roku I had was a little older and some of the remote functions didn’t do me any good so I wanted to streamlined with my Prime account to make things easier. It has not made anything easier. I have no desire to call in to get support when I have already tried everything to power cycle, update and reset the stick and I’m done with it.",1,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
"The Fire stick is constantly using data, LOTS of data. We are on satellite internet because of our remote location, 12 days into our billing cycle we lost all most all connectivity, our phone is through our internet as well so we were essentially cut off. After driving to a location where we could call our ISP we were informed that we had exceeded the cap on our ""unlimited"" plan. Apparently after 150gb the ISP prioritizes everyone else's data ahead of you, effectively choking your connection with out actually cutting you off. So after we discovered that little gem of information we tracked down where all our data was going, you guessed it, fire stick is in constant communication with the mother ship. They chatter like a couple of millennials because in 12 days that innocent looking little device had consumed 153Gb of data or about the amount of my previous two months combined. So now we'll spend the next two weeks with no phone or internet, thanks Firestick.",1,1,2019-12-25,1,2,0
"This review will be from the perspective of a technologically challenged old person. I had a Chromecast device before this and I like it okay but it has its limitations. The fire stick 4K was extremely easy to install on my 6 year old Toshiba flat screen. I have one HDMI port and it plugged in there just fine. The streaming quality is excellent and everything loads extremely fast despite me having the slowest HughesNet internet connection on the planet. I have subscriptions for Netflix, Prime and Hulu and those are probably the only apps I will ever use on this. One thing I love is that I can actually shut my TV off and it stays off. The Chromecast would not allow my TV to ever shut off and if I was gone for the entire day the TV would be running with a screensaver on when I got home if I did not unplug Chromecast. I have no clue how to use the voice control Alexa portion of this. I tried hitting the microphone and talking to the thing but nothing happens so I don't know what I'm doing wrong or how to fix it so that's why I gave 4 stars. I don't have any kind of smart devices in my house and I only have the one old TV so possibly these voice features just won't work for me which I don't care about anyway.  I am sort of confused as to how the picture quality is so excellent because I am not normally able to watch anything in HD quality because I don't have enough bandwidth or internet speed. I used an old PS3 for years and then the Chromecast and both of them give blurry pictures. This thing is like being at the Marcus movie theater!",4,1,2019-7-17,1,1,0

"The remote is so cool. I learned tonight that I can use Voice Command to switch from TV Input or Source HDMI1 to HDMI 2 for example. For my TV I use HDMI1 for the Fire Stick connection and HDMI2 for my computer connection to my flat screen LED TV. After a conversation with Amazon Tech Support we were able to configure the remote to switch from one HDMI Input to the other and his allows me to only the Fire Stick 4K Remote to control Volume, TV On and Off, and Input source. Go to Settings, Equipment Control, Cable and follow the directions. Note use ""Cable"" as the name option and then select your HDMI option. After following the directions you will be able to say ""Alexa Go Home""  or ""Alexa Switch to Cable"" but ""Cable will actually be the HDMI number you said "" cable"" would be.

"Performance and features and especially the remote of the Fire TV Stick 4k is great and a huge improvement over previous versions but, I really wish it has more than 8 GB's (only 5.34 GB's are usable!) memory or even allow you to adopt external storage so you can expand capacity.  Yes I am aware you can do workarounds by using an OTG cable and manually moving files around but that doesn't really work because you can't change the save location of apps.

"When I first purchased my 3 firesticks I would have given at least 3 stars. But, after the software was recently updated I can only give 1. You can no longer arrange apps, on your home screen, as you would like. You are forced to accept Amazon’s idea of how it should look. You can “pin” one app to the front, but that’s it. Every time you download a new app it puts it behind the pinned app. If it’s in your way you can’t move it to the end of your screen. It stays right behind the pinned app. The only way to move it is to delete it or pin a new app. My once orderly screen is now a mess, making it impossible to find anything quickly. It’s like living in a room where the furniture keeps rearranging itself.  This might seem relatively minor to some, but it makes me ask; what will they force on us next? Only Amazon apps on the home screen?  As soon as I can afford to replace my three devices, I’m moving to a company that lets me have control of my own property. In the meantime, maybe someone at Amazon will come to their senses and put the software back the way it was. Then, I can save even more trouble and continue with my “just okay for the money ” piece of hardware.",1,1,2019-3-23,1,3,0

"The few moments the two fire sticks work they work great.  However, I cannot watch more than 10-15 minutes of streaming video before both of them drop the internet connection.  I have tried this on several TV's on both the 2Ghz and %Ghz networks and neither of the 4K Fire sticks are able to hold a wireless signal.  Which is unfortunate because it has turned them into useless pieces of plastic.I do not have any of these problems with my smart TV running the Amazon APP or my computers streaming from the Amazon website.  None of them lose internet signal connected to the same network at the same time and different times.  If Amazon is able to fix this connectivity problem with the firestick then it will be worth the money.  Otherwise, Save your money and just stream from their website on a PC through an HDMI cable to your TV, or your SmartTV apps.  I have had no problems using any of those prodcuts.",1,1,2018-12-2,1,4,0

"I have had a Fire Stick in my ""Zen Den"" for the last 4 years.  My 'smart' TV in my exercise room that should be able to stream Amazon, Netflix, etc. was constantly buffering so I began moving the stick between TV's and then decided to just get one for that room too and chose the 4k.  I love it.  The only issue is that if you have patchy wifi, it reflects the output (buffering, blurry picture, pixelating).  I plan to replace 3 Hoppers with these but because of our patchy wifi, will keep our main DVR/Dish Hopper.

"Works fine so far except for one thing. While I get Dolby Digital (surround sound and Atmos) when watching Amazon content (when supported), when I watch Netflix content, I have so far only been able to get stereo. I have made sure the Audio format has been selected as 5.1 digital in Netflix for the content I have tried and the receiver shows as multi-channel but there is audio only in the front left and right speakers. The Amazon Fire (2nd gen?) that this replaces and which is still connected to the receiver via another HDMI input, gets Netflix in 5.1 Dolby digital surround sound. I've compared the settings between the two Fire devices and they are the same, as far as they can be being two different devices.Otherwise, seems to be mostly as responsive as my 2nd gen Fire TV (both of which are faster than the Fire TV Cube which I returned due to its comparative sluggishness). I do also like the improved video bit depth choices in the settings (8, 10 and 12). It does seem like the Amazon provided UHD HDR content I've viewed with this (so far just Man in the High Castle) is very dim (LG B6 65-inch OLED) and forces me to mess with picture settings on my TV that I do not have to mess with when viewing UHD HDR content on UHD discs and Netflix. I do also wish this had a jack for a hardwired Ethernet connection like the Fire TV. Much more reliable and faster.",4,1,2019-1-16,1,1,0
"Amazon's 4k Fire stic! Burns brighter in ease of use and overall quality picture and sound then the Apple or Roku devices that it competes with. I have only one complaint with Amazon's streaming device: the fact that you land on the top most guides and cannot change that is a major pain. Every time I start my fire, I end up changing category pages rather than scooting through my frequently used apps. The decision to lock your arrival into that top row of page choices is counter-intuitive. I'm not even looking at those page choices. Other apps have figured this out and open their respective apps not n the top shelf page choices but down in the real choices we want to make--whicb slice of entertainment are we going to tuck into first. It is only in this area that Apple surprises by letting the consumer reorganize his device management how they want it if Amazon would make the same flexibility part of their streamers design, the competition would be wiped putApple has a nice solid brick of a device, but it offers no real quality difference in what the 4k Fire and Roku sticks offer.  So, fantastic buy, really the best buy, but with typical baked in design elements that knock the thing back a few pegs.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0
I love the Firestick! It allows us to watch many great shows through many great apps (as long as you have a subscription).Cons: It sometimes has issues. At times we will be watching something and the audio will be lagging so that the audio and video don't match up. This will continue on to any app in the Firestick. The only way to fix the problem is to restart the Firestick. This issue occurs once in a while.,3,1,2020-5-17,1,1,0

"I own 4 1st gen sticks and 1 4k model (3rd gen?)The reason I have so many is that I cut cable a long tome ago, so I need 4 for my TVs around the house and 1 for travelling....and here is where the problem starts.",1,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
"Amazon won't be supporting my Roku device in 2 months, so I decided to try a Fire Stick. The Fire is somewhat better in that the Roku power switch didn't power my TV on and off but the Fire does. The voice recognition feature works well enough and requires that I push a button, so it isn't always listening. Maybe this is a fluke, but when my son went online on his PS3 while I was watching video on Amazon Prime, the system dropped the Prime signal. It said that it was no longer online. However, my son's system and our phones found the internet through my wi-fi as they should have. The Fire suggested I move the TV closer to my router (not doable). Shutting down his PS3 got Prime back. This didn't happen with the Roku.The only reason I got the Fire Stick was to watch Amazon Prime. If the problem with viewing Prime continues to be an issue, I'll go back to the Roku. For a casual watcher, one is as good as the other, otherwise. The controls are just a bit different between them.",4,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0
"I was on my laptop and found an app for the library that let you check out movies and books online.  It is called Hoopla.  I had to carry my laptop over and hook it to the TV with an HDMI cable.  After watching, I would take to the laptop back to my desk.  I started researching on devices to mirror my laptop.  When I found the Fire TV stick, I read all the reviews and decided to try it.  I was going to get Prime anyway and thought that it would be worth it with all the movies available.  When I hooked it up to the HDMI port and followed the instructions, it was very simple to get everything going.  Right away I saw the Hoopla app available to download.  I no longer have to drag my laptop over to the TV to watch the movies.  It is great.  The only problem is that I am hooked on the series Bosch.  It's not really a problem, I just want to watch all the shows.  I have found a ton of movies that I want to watch and there are old TV series that I like.  It is well worth the money, especially if you have Prime.  Even if you don't, there are other apps that you can use that has free content to watch.  You just have to look and investigate.  I do not have a 4K TV but I bought the 4K stick because of the advanced technology.  It works perfect with my older TV through the HDMI port.  The remote turns on the TV and controls the volume as well.  All in all, it was a great buy for me.  I bought it at Best Buy because I could pick it up that day but will consider buying from Amazon now with the Prime membership.Update:",5,1,2019-2-7,1,1,0
"Absolute waste. Does not work. Once it goes to sleep it does not wake up. The only way to wake it up is to go to the device and unplug it, wait 10 seconds and then plug it back in.  I worked with support and they were unable to fix the issue so they sent a replacement. Unfortunately, replacement has same issue. On top of that, if you wish to watch content advertised as “free with prime” it only works occasionally. It won’t allow me to watch, it tells me I have to sign up for Hulu or purchase it. I shared this with support as well, and even allowed them to control my screen. Here is one example, Star Gate Atlantis, all 5 seasons are free with prime, but it only lets me watch some of the episodes. This has happened with everything I’ve tried to watch. The only solution is to go to my Roku, or to my iPad,  where the content is readily available (as advertised). The issue is specific to the fire stik. The rep told me I’m required to get Hulu to view content that is advertised as free with prime. His exact words!!! If it’s free with prime I should not have to buy Hulu to watch. I’m returning it.",1,1,2019-3-22,1,2,1

"So I have a fire stick already and ordered another for a different TV. The new one arrived and it wouldn’t get past the opening screen where it says “fire TV” in white with a black background. So I called customer support which was very fast and helpful but after unplugging and re-plugging it countless times it was deemed to be defective.  The tech was very patient and courteous and patient.  He ordered me a replacement and it arrived the next day.  I plugged in the replacement and it did the same thing. I tried both units on 3 different TVs and keep in mind I already have a fire stick that works just fine on those TVs.  Once again I called customer service and got a tech with an extremely difficult to understand strong accent. He put me on hold for a while and asked “what would you like to do to resolve this”. Well, you’ve proven you can’t get it right twice now so I decided to order a Roku stick and give that a try.Now I have two boxes of defective parts I have to pack up, print out labels and take to the UPS store to return.",1,1,2019-2-13,1,1,0
These things SUCK.... I have very good internet and absolutely no problems when using my roku or other devices... But this thing wow..... Not only does it produce a low quality image for the first few minutes before it decides to actually provide a decent resolution it randomly quits working.... Sometimes it'll stop working in 30 minutes sometimes an hour but as far as finishing a movie? HA good luck. It'll act as if it quit receiving internet and needs to be reconnected and I have to reboot the device. Again it's not my wifi causing this this is the only device I've had issues with. This is so the SECOND fire stick I've owned and both have had this issue. Im starting to give up on Amazon items. My echo buds and my fire stick both have issue after issue. They just release items that aren't ready without any care and expect us to be the test subjects.,1,1,2020-2-18,1,1,0

The built in remote will control your TV power and also the volume. I was also pleasantly surprised they included a short HDMI adapter cable if you have tight tolerances. My only complaint is the power cord is only around 5 feet, if you have a USB port on the back of your TV you’re in luck.

Later my TV just shut off right after we ""re-Turn on"". We have no proof it's the problem with the 4K TV, so we changed to another TV and same issue happens after 2 months of use and it started shutting itself off like the 1st TV.

"My old Roku stick was going bad.  I have had it for a long time and enjoyed it, but wanted 4K when I replaced it and decided to do some reading up before making a decision.  The 4K Firestick seemed to be a good choice, so I bought one.  The first thing I noticed when hooking it up was that I could not get YouTubeTV on it.  That was not disclosed anywhere in the ad. YouTubeTV is the only streaming service that offers all the network channels in my area and I've used it for a couple years.  After researching it online I discovered it's not available because of a feud between Google and Amazon, although the YouTube app is available.  That's confusing and Amazon is being childish in this feud (So is Google, but they aren't my issue here).  DirectTv Now is the next best streaming option in my area, so I tried the one week trial.  In watching it on the Firestick I noticed that the audio was not in sync with the video.  It was very noticeable and annoying.  So I tried Netfix and Amazon Video.  Both had the same audio sync issue.  I rebooted the Firestick removed the apps and reloaded and I STILL had the audio sync issue.  At that point I gave up on the Firestick and returned it.  I instead purchased the Roku 4k streaming stick.  It works flawlessly with YouTubeTV. Since I still had time on my DirectTV Now trial I tried it and there were no audio sync issues or any of the other apps.  Amazon, if you want the Firestick to compete with Roku, drop your foolish feud with Google and  build better hardware.",1,1,2018-12-22,1,4,0

"Hooked it up to my new 4K TV, entered password for my wifi network and... nothing.  ""Could not connect to Amazon"". Checked everything, went to support page, restarted everything.... nothing.  Went on the web, where there are a number of people who had the same problem, apparently stick doesn't like Comcast.  Security settings suggested to be a problem, but even with firewall turned OFF, didn't work. If can't get support for this soon will be returning it for a Roku.Update: Spent about 7 hours on 5 calls with customer service. 2 calls provided by phillipine based service-wasted my time. 2 US based agents much better and one was superb. She even called to follow up 2 times. Nothing we tried worked, stick kept on trying an Amazon web site that delivered a 404 response.  Then, the day after the last call, it showed up on my home network and was able to connect.  Now finally seems fully functional.  Great picture, easy to use. Alexa remote seems to work well- was able to bring up ring doorbell on tv- but haven't fully tested. It should not have been so hard to get it to work, but happy with final result.  Would have returned it, except customer service rep Kristina was so fantastic. Glad I waited. If you have this same problem, there is a key combo that ends with hitting menu that showed the website the stick was trying to access.

The fire stick works great. But don’t get ripped of in the promotion. I was supposed to get a 20% credit for trading in my old fire stick and buying a new one.

"We like the Firestick.  We are looking forward to Amazon working out an agreement with YouTube TV so we can get all of our local channels live.  Right now we are lacking NBC, and are using an air antenna to fill in that gap.The video and audio quality is excellent.  Navigating the many choices with Amazon Prime, NetFlix, Philo, and YouTube TV took a little while to get used to.  The available content is almost overwhelming.  And moving from a world where our viewing was based on a set schedule from our former cable company to a world where we watch what we want, when we want, took a little getting used to.

I already had Alexa devices deployed around my house so I was plugged into the eco-system already.I took the Firestick out of the box, plugged in the HDMI and power cable and it basically self configured and installed itself.  Honestly I was shocked that I didn't have to do anything.  It even somehow correctly determined the TV type I had and configured the remote control to work with it.

I tried troubleshooting with customer support (which was very helpful and she tried her best to help) but after trying for an hour she said to try doing a factory reset and sometimes it takes a couple of hours.  I completed the reset, and waited and waited.  The customer support called me every hour, but after an additional two hours (now a total of four), I decided we had a defective one and returned it.  Rather than wasting more time on trying another, I went with the Roku Streaming Stick+ and found that the quality was the same, but the interface on the Roku is way better.

Instead what do they do? When you try to make the picture full screen they have a disclaimer stating and I quote  (NORMAL IS THE OPTIMAL WIDE MODE AND CAN NOT BE CHANGED) so you are stuck with a picture sometimes only 22.5 inches on a 50 inch big screen!",1,1,2019-2-1,1,2,0
"It sat on the kitchen counter for a week after we got it, until I gathered the nerve to hook it up and try it out. We lost our HBO thanks to the contract dispute between it and Dish; then I subscribed to HBO through my Amazon Prime account, and while it said everything was fine, we couldn't access any HBO programming. After a couple of hours on the phone with a patient Amazon tech, we figured out that while our TV may be ""smart,"" it is not genius enough to handle subscriptions - it was born a year too early. (We had a conversation about how helpful it would have been if a pop-up box had told me that it was incompatible while I was trying to install, rather than putting both of us through all these hoops. He concurred, and said he would have a chat with that department.) SO, cancel the subscription, refund the month I was charged for, and we planned to buy a new TV - until I thought about the Fire Stick. And it works like a charm. BINGO! Last night we watched the first three episodes of the final season of Game of Thrones - really the only reason I got it, but I think there will be LOTS of reasons to  keep it.",5,1,2019-5-20,1,1,0

"Amazingly good at streaming performance.  Turned to a FireStick when an early Blu-ray player would soon no longer be supported by Netflix.  Even with now relying on Wi-Fi, rather than ethernet, as the source, the picture is nearly instantly at full HD resolution and the regularly degraded images and occasional pauses are no longer interrupting the viewing experience with Netflix or Prime.  The presentation of NFL Game Pass screenings is perfect, too, unlike the buggy presentation when we previously used a decent laptop computer to stream games on the HDTV.  We are still learning how to use the integration with Alexa, but the two devices readily found each other.  We are still learning the voice control aspect of the remote control, too, but it is quite intuitive to use the physical controls.  Having ordered the 4K device from Amazon Prime, it came with all our account data already entered, so setup was basically confirming what was preloaded and specifying the WiFi information.

I have all the apps I watch in my smart tv so the real decision will be made when I take it with me on travel.The two things I don't like about the Fire Stick at all, is when I'm watching a series sometimes it will just stop streaming at the end of an episode and everytime it does this or I stop it myself and go back in, it has either taken me to a random place in the series or the very beginning and I have to search for the location I stopped at. With regular Amazon Prime, it will take you right to where you left off.  When on Amazon music it also picks up right where you left off which I like.

"For $50, you're not going to find a better streaming device that can play Netflix, Youtube AND Amazon content in HD. Most other streaming devices (with a few exceptions), run Android mobile, which cannot run the 3 streaming services in HD. That fact, along with the ability to modify the stick to your liking allows for endless possibilities. Obviously with an Amazon device, the emphasis is on Amazon content and some advertising, but it's easy to look past once you've been using the device for a bit.While my personal favorite streaming device is the Amazon Fire TV 2nd Gen (Discontinued), this device is comparable in smoothness of operation and is miles ahead of the Amazon Fire TV Stick 2nd Gen as far as performance goes. While the spec sheet might not blow you away, the hardware combined with the software make this a winner. And Amazon stnads behind the product. The support is quick to help fix the problems, and if the device can't be fixed, they are quick to replace the item.

The remote synchs with your primary TV remote. . .allowing you to control your TV with the stick remote.A recommendation.  You have to download and reinstall some (not all) of your apps. This isn't an issue if you check off the box at the time of purchase,  to have Amazon install your setting from your current stick. All your saved apps will appear in the apps menu on the stick.

"Had this now for about 2 maybe 3 weeks, I figured it's time for a review. The Fire Stick 4K is the best sub-$50 streaming device you can get. The picture quality is great through both HD and 4K content, the sound quality on most apps blow their Roku versions out of the water, and the Wi-fi signal almost always remain strong & durable. This stick is also compatible with a Ethernet connection but you must purchase a separate Ethernet adapter first though. This stick is also Dolby Atmos capable, but only on Prime Video for now, and right now Jack Ryan and Suspiria (2018 remake) are the only two Atmos content on there. So no, the Netflix app on the stick has Dolby Atmos support, just Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 only.I'm also very glad YouTube is officially back on Amazon devices since the Amazon vs. Google feud ended a while back, now we just need YouTube TV to be released on Amazon devices so I can try that out at some point in time. Only two notable apps not on Amazon at all are Vudu and Spectrum, the former is not a huge dealbreaker as I wouldn't mind just using the app on my Xbox One X.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
I just got my new 4K firer stick on September 19th 2019 her it's recently and sell for $49 when I got it for a good deal for $34 save 15% and I bought a new from wrote case for it also I would recommend the fire 4K fire stick it's a very good item it's a lot better in you don't have any very many glitches with it it streams well and so lot better than the 1st one so I would recommend to get the 4K fire stick it's a good law item to have it saves on your TV bill and it's and it's at a very reasonable price if you can get it on stale stuff $49 that's pretty reasonable but if you get it on sale or are of the sound and on Amazon is where I got it I would recommend it to others have a great day and take care I hope this helps.,5,1,2019-9-20,1,2,1
"This is basically what you'd expect for a streaming device, but the requirement for the additional power connection  is annoying.  I have a PoE switch that I bought the ethernet adapter for, and when I plugged it in, the Fire Stick was not being powered.  Since there are no other ports, how do I then connect the power adapter??  Seems like the unit should figure this out then PoE is available and plugged in, but it didn't power up.  So it otherwise seems I wasted $15 on the ethernet adapter.  Otherwise, the interface is top notch, like you get from Prime, and the streaming works just fine.  For some reason, I did have to go back in and re-enter all my login info after I had done it prior.  Not sure if you have to do this every time you move it from TV to TV, but if so, that is also annoying.",3,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0
"So my first problem:  How to open the battery compartment?  The visual ""instructions"" on the sleeve of the remote were less than helpful.  Fortunately, someone else who had the same problem posted a YouTube video explaining his frustration and demonstrated how to do it- but even then, he had problems on the demo video.  This is just unacceptable.  I have minor arthritis in my thumb joints, but he didn't - and he still had problems opening the battery compartment!  Once I managed to open the battery compartment (already mighty frustrated), I inserted the batteries.  Tried the power button - nothing happened.  Several more tries until I concluded the batteries that came with the remote were DEAD ON ARRIVAL.  They must be ancient - I replaced them with some of my own that are at least three years old.  They were very weak, but at least the remote fired up!  That is a shameful thing for Amazon to do to customers.  So now, I'm unable to ""fire up"" my Fire TV for lack of batteries.  Shame on you, Amazon.",1,1,2019-7-19,1,1,0
"I think this is my first bad review ever. If you have a 4k TV without it being a smart TV (highly doubtful), this will get you streaming video. For everyone else, the voice commands were very difficult, and it took more time to get what I wanted with voice commands versus just clicking the apps, either on the fire stick, or on the TV. Since the TV already has apps, no need for the fire stick. The fire stick should come with a link to a sortable .PDF file that tells you exactly how to perform each task. There are likely forums and information out there but the customer shouldn't have to search. I also use cable, was able to voice switch between the apps on the TV and cable, but the fire stick voice commands did not work well with the cable. I was able to say change to channel 511, but if I asked Alexa to go to ""name of show"" on channel 511 it couldn't find it. I gave the stick away. Future versions should come with a simple instruction sheet pointing to an online sortable file.",1,1,2019-3-4,1,1,0
First the remotes power button only tells you to try alexa to do things other than turn off the damn thing; it used to work for maybe a month. Next thing is its really difficult to know exactly where you are on any menu: instead of a mark showing where you are; the whole list moves and you have to learn what position on the screen the different words on the list are located to be sure. What moron came up with that idea? I cant imagine a group of morons decided on that style. I guess they wanted to be cute; but I want to know exactly where I am; not hoping and trying to find out I was wrong and feeling stupid.The help menu sucks; there isnt even a search option for basic words; just quick tips and help videos. Is there a video on how to make the on off button work on the remote? Oh did I just get lucky buying their product that is so cheap the buttons stop working in the first few months?,1,1,2019-5-2,1,1,0
"This is a great device overall - pushes beautiful 4K content effortlessly, thanks the solid internals.  I will say though, that for those considering buying it because Android underneath it all, and can sideload all kinds of funky stuff, be warned.  There is very little RAM, and even less storage.  And the stability comes into question once you start wandering even a little off the reservation.  Apps hanging etc.  Would be an absolute dream with 3GB RAM and either more built in storage (at least 32GB) or a built-in USB3 port/SD card slot.Interesting fact, I was able to add an OTG cable to 3 port USB hub with built in Gbit ethernet, and the storage attached to the hub and the ethernet all worked without a hitch.  Just FYI.",4,1,2018-12-14,1,2,0
"I’ve been a long time Roku user and purchase the Fire Stick 4K while it was on sale over the holidays. I absolutely love the user experience over Roku. I feel like the Fire TV was snappier at loading apps than my Roku 4K, and the overall app designs were more pleasing to me than their Roku counterparts. That being said, they are missing Vudu, Google Play Movies, and Fandango Now. I like to buy movies where the best deal exists. I know these apps have functionality with Movies Anywhere, but I own several movies that are not participating studios and therefore won’t cross platform sync with Movies Anywhere. The other thing is there can be multiple results for the same movie (HD, UHD, w/bonus materials). It’s too much in my opinion and I’d rather just see a single title show up with the highest viewing option. I think if these gaps were fixed (and maybe a few other minor tweaks), Fire TV would be the best streaming solution in my opinion.",3,1,2020-1-16,1,1,0
"I heard so many things about the Amazon Fire TV Stick and I must say that so far it’s lived up to my expectations.

"I got a new TV over the '18 holidays and it was time to upgrade my streaming device so I purchased the Fire TV Stick 4k as well as a Roku Ultra.

"I decided to pick up this new 4K Fire TV Stick for the bedroom but it ended up becoming our main streaming device for the house unseating the more expensive but older gen 2 Fire TV box. Both offered 4K video and great picture quality BUT this stick is just quicker moving around the menus and loading apps like Netflix, Hulu, Kodi, and live streaming IPTV.This came as a total surprise to me that the stick is able to stream and move around faster/equal to the older box even though the box was hardwired ethernet and this stick was simply connected to my wifi network.  Actual speeds were 58 MBPS wifi on 4k stick VS 78 MBPS on the hardwired box but the stick was smoother.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,1,0
"I have used this for about a month now and I am extremely pleased. I was originally using a satellite TV service along with apps installed on my smart TV. This has taken the place of both and made using the various services so much easier.I connected this to my LG television and ended up getting the optional Ethernet adapter since the TV is right next to my internet router. I’m not experiencing any issues with connection and picture quality is excellent.  I’ve replaced my satellite TV service with Philo and saved $100 per month. Between that and my other supported services like Netflix, PlutoTV, and Hulu, and Prime Video, everything I could want to watch is available through the homescreen and controlled with the Amazon Fire remote. I have not tried to use it with my Alexa Dot, but it’s really cool having everything integrated. Setup was also very simple and the Fire Stick automatically detected the LG TV and the Vizio sound bar so they can be controlled on the Amazon remote.",5,1,2018-12-22,1,2,0
"I bought mine exactly on November 18, 2018. Today is July 17th, 2020, and its starting to go bad. So, that fits the 1.5 yr. timeline when it goes bad. I have only 12 apps downloaded and the stick is starting to alert me that I have ""NO MEMORY REMAINING"". REALLY???. The stick will send me to this page in the middle of watching Fire and refuse to leave the page. I now need a new stick. Should I take the $25 off deal, or wait for the new device launch later this year? No, I don't have any ""inside info"" on Amazon's product launches, but in the past Amazon has sold the stick for cheap just before introducing a new product replacement. Paying $29 dollars for the stick sounds pretty good, even if it's only for 1.5 yrs. of usage? Or, should I wait to see what Amazon will offer? Putting the $29 toward an improved stick seems like the more logical move. But, there is no guarantee that the new stick will be any better then the one offered now. Just putting ""lipstick on a pig"". I may just wait.",3,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"I love Amazon and all their products HOWEVER I am not happy with the fire stick.  I've had too many issues with the remote not working.  The cost of the remote is nearly the cost of a new unit.  I suppose I can reach out and request that Amazon replaces the remote since the units are fairly new.UPDATE!  USER ERROR! I originally gave 1 star, not because I don't love Amazon EVERYTHING but because I've had issues with all my remotes.  After posting a review, Rachel from Amazon called me in legit 30 seconds.  EXCELLENT SERVICE!  I was busy when she called...HOWEVER she offered to call me back in the late evening at a time that was convenient to me.  She called as promised and fixed my issue. So BRAVO!

"I have Roku and have been a big fan for many years. What I like about Roku is that there are lots of apps available. Not that there are very little apps for the Fire Stick, it's just that sideloading apps that are not from the Amazon app store is a hassle and sometimes doesn't work. Overall, even with what is available from the Amazon app store it still is a great streaming device.The stick was installed in my bedroom TV which is a bit further away from the router which is in the living room. Network signal was not great according to Fire TV stick analysis. So i upgraded my router to a newer model (it needed upgrading anyway) and now the wifi strength is perfect. No lag in streaming any of the 4k Prime shows and Netflix. Using the Alexa voice control was also a little helpful when you are too lazy to 'type'.",5,1,2019-5-25,1,1,0
"We have six televisions in our house and have had satellite and cable premium packages through DirectTV and ATT.  Our  monthly bill was more than $700 for television, internet, and mobile phones with almost half of that related to television costs.  We decided to stream television and we have tried a few options including hulu live and PS live television.  We have Fire Sticks on each of our televisions and recently upgraded one of our televisions to a Fire Stick 4K.While we have loved the Fire Sticks, we find that the Fire Stick 4K delivers maybe a better picture but is absolutely faster in navigating through apps, tv listings, and streaming content.  The Fire Stick comes in a small box and is simple to install.  All you have to do is plug it into the television and plus the Fire Stick into a USB slot behind the tv, and you are done.  It's that simple.  We honestly do not miss our cable or satellite and we will never go back.  I'm not sure how either of those options will survive in this technological age unless they start to reduce their prices to be competitive.

"This purchase was from points off my wife’s credit card. I already have 2. But this new one is the best yet. It has a power button that turns off the fire tv and tv ( without doing any programming). The volume being on the remote is also superb. The fast forward and backward seem to be a smoother transition. I also have 2 Apple TV, they are great when you use Apple products. But this new setup makes getting around crazy apps much easier. Great update, apples updates are not near as noticeable and the apple brick is a pain to hide. Had to get heavy duty velcro to hold it to the back of my tv. Everything is wall mounted also the wiring behind TVs, very clean look. This is no problem with the fire stick and has never been. Cost comparison 5 fire sticks for the cost of Apple TV.My reviews are from, all my reviews are accurate. I delete all the company’s who ask to review the item the day it and the product arrives. I am reviewing purchases where I have used it for months and get to know the product. I don’t review some items.

I got an Echo Dot for Christmas and gave one of my Roku’s (4k stick) to my niece, so I decided to replace it with the 4K fire stick. I wish I had read the reviews - it was literally in the first customer review that said the Charter Spectrum app was not supported.

The reason for 2 star is because after soending for the device in order to get the best picture out of this we have to pay $7 a month like a subscription just to see it in UHD. By far the worse idea and almost made me return it but my other one is old and I wanted to upgrade. Thanks for robbing me from that experience. Maybe they should tell us it’s $7 a month that way people know and just keep what they have. Sad that everything has a monthl6 plan now. Greed with Amazon is at an all time high. Does anyone really need to charge for HD specially when they bought the 4k UHD product for that purpose. Smdh they should be ashamed. I doubt anyone actually pays for that. They rather it go to waste before they let you enjoy the product to the fullest. Same effect as restaurants that rather throw away food then feed the homeless. Sad how many companies make poor choices since they’re rich and could care less at this point lets keep robbing the less fortunate til they feel abused enough to speak up. Thanks I honestly regret all the money I spent with companies that rob the average hard working person. Keep your HD Amazon guess you guys must be struggling to charge $7 a month for something that should come with the device.

As best I could tell, she was insisting the problem was with my internet connection.  I told her my internet speed was 100/100 Mbps.

"Overall, in terms of function, this is an improvement over the original Fire Stick.  Less lag, higher quality picture, fewer pauses during streaming, although they still happen.  It was a little difficult to get the remote to pair with the stick, and once in a while, they stop communicating, so you have to ""reboot"" the system for them to start talking to each other again.  One thing that really bugs me is that the stick itself has a very (very) short HDMI cable  - it makes it a little difficult to insert, and then it just hangs from that cable.  It would be nice if they made it a couple feet long so that the stick could actually rest on something and not just hang there.  I suppose  could use my own, longer HDMI cable, but as long as Amazon is supplying a cable, it seems like an easy thing to make it longer.  Other than that, I'm reasonable happy with the Fire Stick 4K.  It's definitely better than the original Fire Stick, and that was my primary objective in purchasing it.",4,1,2019-2-17,1,1,0

"I love shopping on Amazon - I use Alexa and actually own a Fire Stick for travel.  In looking to outfit my numerous older TVs with a streaming player, I naturally had to look at the Fire Sticks as well as Roku Streaming Sticks.  Fire Stick Pros:  1)  Easy to set up, 2) Nice looking and easy to use remote, 3) Has a lot of the channels I would want in my streaming device (still need HBO Max and Peacock IMO).  Then I tried the Roku Streaming Stick+ - comments:  1) Easy to set up, 2) I like the Alexa remote better - its sleeker, more high tech - but its still easy to use, 3) It also has a lot of the channels I would want in my streaming device (also needs HBO Max and Peacock IMO).  So why did I pick the Roku?  I wanted to keep things simple and Roku offers me a simple display of my channels without too many placed ads and ""features"" littered throughout, so it is easier to navigate through what I would like to watch.  I really do not think I need Alexa on my remote or on my TV, and I do not want to see everything that Prime Video offers while scrolling through the Fire Stick (I also subscribe to Prime Video, but I don't want to see it displayed everywhere).  Finally, although I like the Fire Stick, I deducted two stars.  The first star deducted is due to the fact that I am being charged almost $8 to return the Fire Stick unless I return it directly to an Amazon Locker!  I've purchased hundreds of items through Amazon and I believe this is the first time I am being charged to return anything.  The second star deducted is that I have to completely package up my return in a box.  I have returned dozens of items to Amazon, and I would say 90% of the time I can just drop it off at the UPS store without having to package it up.  Not with this purchase!  Is this Amazon's way of getting back at me for not keeping the Fire Stick?

The remote is BIGGER than the Apple remote, which means we can actually FIND it without having to get out a search light (we hate the fact that it is so hard to find the Apple remote. Talk about form over function!)  All in all, it is easier to use than the Apple TV, but does everything we need. Only one big complaint - we are Canadians currently living in the USA with credit cards registered in Canada. Amazon REFUSES to let us rent or buy videos on Amazon Prime because of this. So every time we want to spend money on a movie, we have to switch off the Amazon stick and go back to Apple (which will take your credit card regardless of where you live). We are at a loss to understand why Amazon Prime does not want our money, but ... so be it. We will give all our extra money to Apple, until Amazon Prime gets over itself, and takes Canadian credit cards as well. Seems really really stupid to us, though.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,1,0
I bought my 4K fire stick earlier this year however did not write a review at that time. I am not very knowledgeable about some more recent electronic products so I know I am not able to use the stick to the full value. I have used to a number of times and it sometimes does quite a bit of buffering. I recently purchased an Ethernet Adapter to use with it and buffering has not occurred since then. I like the 4K fire stick better than a similar product which I have used for some time now. I am quite satisfied with my fire stick. I have not tried using the Alexa integrated and Voice recognition as so far it has been possible for me to locate what I want to watch or do without using those. Part of my lack of thehnical knowledge I guess. I have considered buying another one to use with my second TV as I don't want to move the stick back and forth between two TV's,5,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0
"I purchased the firestick for a TV that we moved to our screen porch; we created an outdoor Living Room, so we could get some fresh air and relax outside during the Covid-19 pandemic. I do not have a lot of experience with streaming apps and this device is amazing! Very easy to setup and great quality over my Wi-Fi. I love it so much that I bought a second one to use in our bonus room where we do not have cable. I highly recommend the firestick if you have an Amazon membership and are considering cutting the cord. Yes, there are fees for the apps like Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, etc. but there are also a few free ones and trials for the others so you can find your favorite.I love asking Alexa to find me a movie or show that I want to watch, as well. She usually does pretty well.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
"As a FireStick Gen 2 owner, I wanted to explore cutting the cord with my cable company (Spectrum). I decided I'd try YouTube TV (with great reviews) for a month. First off, I had no problem with the FireStick Gen 2. All of the Prime content and other content was great, no video or audio problems. Downloading & using YouTube TV (YTTV), I found that the live (and recorded) streaming quality was substandard to cable. YTTV allows you to view the geeky info on buffering, video resolution and connection speed, and I found that the max I was getting was 720P @ 60 frames/sec. Even with that, the video stuttered, (I'll add in skipped, jittered, fluttered, buffered not that it describes it but just for those searching for the right description). In short, the video was not smooth. Especially noticeable with sports and any type of scrolling. YTTV was only connecting at about 20 mbps. My FireStick Gen 2 utilized the (optional) ethernet adapter and I was running that through a 50ft cable to my router. Foolishly, I thought that maybe my old, very long Cat 5 cable was the sticking point so I ordered a $12 Cat 7 cable and ran that. No difference. As a last try, I ordered the new FireStick 4K and replaced the Gen 2 unit. That WAS the problem. The FireStick 4K with a faster processor and 50% more memory more than doubled the download speed of the Gen 2 FireStick. My reading is now around 45 mbps (speeds will vary depending on content and program). Live and recorded content is at 1080p and the video is smoooth! Just like cable! Not only that, I programmed the remote (very simple to do) so that it turns on/off my receiver and the TV at the same plus controls volume on the receiver and mute - all in one!I love this unit and highly recommend it for cord cutters. Next step - I'm buying an Ooma Telo unit and transferring my home phone then bye-bye cable!",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I'm a Prime member but rarely used the video&music portion of my membership.  Previously I was accessing the video thru my DVD player which had a clunky user interface (which is probably why I didn't use it much).  Amazon ended support of the Sony products.  I got a $25 discount code and thought...why not.  I have an older 1080 HDTV but opted for the 4K FireTV to be prepared for a future TV upgrade, plus cashed in some of my Amazon Rewards and had this for free.Biggest complaint is the remote, specifically, the back is a real PITA to get open.  I have literally opened thousands of battery compartments.  Nearly every one in intuitive.  I expected this to be the same, but NOOO, I struggled with it for a good 15min before finally heading to google for some assistance.  It seems that this is by far and away the biggest complaint.  Do yourself a favor, don't struggle with the remote like I did, head over to google or youtube and watch a video or two and you will get it open fairly quickly.  Amazon needs to change the design of the remote battery cover and/or get the quick start/manual updated, because it is clearly not as simple as ""open the remote and install the batteries""...but in all honesty, opening the battery compartment is something that will be done infrequently and you really don't want to cover popping open every time the remote drops on the floor (which already happened a few times for me).",4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
This is my second 4k stick unit and i have no complaint what so ever. We have a couple ageing tvs in the home that still work wonderfully but wont be getting future updates thus causing some streaming apps to no no longer work.  This would my solution instead of buying a new tv and it has worked wonderfully.  The 4k stick has definitely come a long way since the first gen stick and is now far faster and more reliable.  I was up and running instantly as set up was a breeze.  The app store is huge and theres plenty to watch and choose from.  And finally the remote feels wonderful and responds quickly.  You get all this in a very discreet package that doesnt take up any extra space in the home.  This is a great device and definitely recommend.,5,1,2020-8-22,1,1,0
This is a big improvement over my two previous Fire Sticks that I use to stream TV throughout my house.  This 4K unit is much faster than my others and adds on and off control and volume control of my sound bar and TV.  Now I don't need all those extra remotes cluttering the table and my wife has stopped complaining.One nice thing about this Fire Stick is that because I bought it directly from Amazon it arrived pre-programmed with all my existing apps.  Installing it was literally as simple as plugging it into my TV and watching.,5,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"This is great if you're streaming Amazon Prime but forget about Netflix which is one of the apps that it's supposed to support.  It just stalls out after about 15 minutes into the movie.  An error message says that it cannot play that title at that time.  So I've switched to different movies only to have the same thing happen.  However, I have no problem streaming Netflix on my computer or on a DVD player - just with the Amazon TV sticks.  I recommend going with maybe a Roku.",1,1,2020-3-15,1,2,0
"We bought this device so we could get rid of cable. It works fine for Netflix and Amazon prime but so does my smart TV without the Firestick. The best streaming service for our needs and budget is YOUTUBE TV but the Firestick does not have an app to support it. How is that possible? There is a Youtube app but that is not the same as a Youtube TV app. Why doesn't the Firestick support all the streaming apps?  Now I'm going to have to buy a Roku and the money I spent on Firestick is just down the drain. Amazon, you can do better for a customer who has been a Prime member for over 15 years.",2,1,2019-3-5,1,2,0
I had a 1st generation stick that was soooo slooooow. I thought it was my wifi signal because my router was very old and sometimes my phone wouldn't get great wifi either. Replaced that. Helped a little but hardly. I wasn't sure about getting a new stick because I was afraid it would be the same. The TV I use it for also isn't 4k. I plugged it in just now and OMG. Night and day difference. It actually responds when I click buttons on the remote. Like it is actually a functioning piece of technology. Amazing.I got the 4k version so I could upgrade my TV in the future if I want. I don't use the voice recognition either. I live alone and just end up feeling like I'm talking to myself.,5,1,2020-7-10,1,2,0
"First off, I had the previous iteration of this device, the Fire TV Pendent. It worked pretty well at the time, but with this upgrade, a major selling point for me was the remote and the faster CPU. Once I plugged the device in and fired it up and got it configured, I could definitely see a major speed increase over the Pendent (which wasn't that much of slouch to begin with).Set up was easy, but initial will take some time as it also updates the device to the latest software. Once that is done, it will walk you through steps to integrate the remote with your TV. If it works, you'll have a remote for the Fire TV as well as your TV where you can power on and off your tv, control the volume of the TV, and if compatible with your TV, you can use the voice control to switch from one HDMI port to another as well as to your cable port if you have cable or a digital antenna, which is what I have as we dumped cable years ago.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0

"This is a favorite purchase of my family, and we ended up buying more for other members of the family. I love that we can get Prime Videos, as well as all other streaming services, TV channel apps, YouTube, and a variety of other apps. I recently tried the audiobook function, and it was a great feature to have. This has made life so much easier, and I love that you can use the voice recognition on the remote.Unfortunately, it does not work as well as we had hoped when trying to give directions through our Alexa/dot. It can pause well, and play again if we do it soon after pausing. One problem is that after it is paused for a while (maybe a few minutes, not very long at all), if you say ""play,"" it won't play. It will be on a different screen, which is very frustrating. I have tried to raise and lower the volume with Alexa, with minimal success. The fast forward and rewind functions are the worst functions with Alexa - they either keep fast forwarding to the end of the movie/episode, or rewind sporadically. If I say ""next episode,"" it seems to work every time. Unfortunately, if it is a TV show with the option to ""skip intro,"" Alexa doesn't seem to recognize that command. I would like to see Alexa recognize many more variations of commands, so you don't have to keep a list of exactly how to say some thing for Alexa to operate properly. Perhaps if it doesn't understant what you meant, it could say ""did you mean X?"" - and then learn from your response so it knows what to do the next time.",5,1,2019-7-9,1,0,0
"Love 4k fire tv. Works most of the time with alexia, but sometimes has issues. Might be user error that is causing some control issues. There are lots of setup options that I might have configured incorrectly.The main reason that I do not give it a 5 star rating, which it should clearly deserves, is that there is no ""Native Youtube"" app, though access is there, but pretty poor implemented. No Google play music app, No Google play Movie app, and rampant commercialism.",1,1,2019-1-2,1,1,0

"I bought this because my 65"" Samsung UHD Smart TV is getting a bit too long in the tooth now to be able to access some among this enormous, and in my view rather unpleasant, proliferation of streaming services.  I was an ""early adopter"" and and this is one of the pitfalls of that strategy, alas!  The new services are not developing apps for a TV as old as mine, and unfortunately this includes a couple of biggies, Disney+ and CBS All Access, rendered mandatory by being the only sources now for their content, which include ""The Mandalorian"" and ""Star Trek: Picard.""But I digress.  I opened this product and it was well-packaged and complete, except it does not come with wired Ethernet capability -- you need to purchase an additional attachment for that.  Fortunately my 802.11ac router sits only about 18 inches from the device so I do not need it.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"it took a few phone calls and talking to some nice rep some not so nice rep but finally I had to finger it out to get it to work.  When I 1st got it, it was like a no brainer to connect.  I am no professional but this is not the 1st TV that I have hooked up!  For what ever reason the fire stick ""shuts down"" everytime the TV is off I tried different HDMI port, different outlets on the power strip etc.  I had to take the fire stick out and replug it so it would reboot.  called support got a lady who gave me two options either 1) send me a new one or 2) update software and call me back to check on me in a couple of days.  I didn't want them to wast money so I opted to try the update,  noone called me back so I called got a rude support person who talked to me like I was stupid!  refusing to send me a replacement but really gave me no other option,  everything he wanted me to do I told him I had tried,  Finally unwilling he agreed to send me a replacement.  well, that didn't work either!!!  I finally decided to try plugging the usb power to the back of the TV instead of the power outlet even though it is not recommended because it says it might not have enough power to load the update but low and behold, it worked!!!  NOT one single support person suggested this option!  To be fair, so the problem may not be the firestick, I still don't understand why.  I have the same power Surge protector power strip and DVD player, sound bar, Satellite box. VCR (yes, VCR) all worked but the fire stick didn't.  the fact that there is no independent power button for the firestick  (it's  synced with the TV so the power on the fire stick turns on both the TV and the fire stick) causing it not to restart after the TV was turned off.  Now that it's the power of the fire stick is plugged into the TV as soon as I switch the ""input"" of the TV to HDMI port it's plugged into it fires up!  Then there're those channels or apps or what ever you call them.  Most of them want you to subscribe for a fee after a trial period.  There are a couple free ones and of course there's always Amazon prime stuff to work.  I only got this as a secondary source for when there's nothing to watch and didn't want to pay monthly for streaming service.  now that it's working It's ok  I just can't get over how rude that one support guy was!!!",2,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
Great product to make your not so smart tv smarter. I had several TVs that did not have smart apps built in and when I cut the cord I needed a solution that did not involve a cellphone to turn things off and on because not everyone in my family can learn new tricks. I had chromecast on a few which worked but it meant you had to pull out a phone to start to stream something. This fixes that and provides a remote for the old school folks.The remote integration works really well and is easy to setup. I have used it with sound bars TVs and multiple brands of amplifiers successfully. It almost makes the universal remote worthless and with just a TV and soundbar it would. It works through walls and cabinets and functions great with my harmony smart remotes as well. Picture quality has been great. I have my own 5g wifi router and google fiber so bandwidth has never been an issue getting higher quality streaming than with my hardwired chromecast at times.,5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying that I am in my early-mid 30's and I fear that I am getting to that age where I cannot keep up with the latest technology anymore. I have a smart TV and was relatively content using various apps through said TV. The only issue I had was the receiver being a jerk at times and requiring a restart when switching apps (like going from Netflix to Hulu and suddenly losing audio). I just figured it was time to buy a new receiver.But then I learned of a streaming service called Shudder and it looked like everything I have ever wanted. Unfortunately, I had no way of accessing Shudder through my TV and so I did some research and found that Fire TV Stick was one option. I'll be honest here; I had no idea what a fire stick was, how it worked, if I needed to purchase other accessories or services to use it..... The good news is that I know how to use the Google machine and so I was able to learn that this fire stick was indeed a simple and straightforward means to access Shudder.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Today I decided to watch philo tv on my amazon fire stick, only to find out that amazon used the fire stick to post a very divisive political message right in my face. The message expressed support for a far left radical violent group black lives matter. I chatted with someone in an attempt to have it removed and they apologized and told me it was an ad and would last 24 to 48 hours and there was nothing they could do about it. I have been seeing this garbage all week on different tv stations and would just add them to my long list of banned stations who think I care about their political beliefs. But unless you want to get rid of the fire stick entirely and switch to Roku you are at their mercy. So just know if they want to send you political brainwashing info that you don't want to see there is nothing you can do about it.",1,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"I bought this to upgrade an old Vizio (semi-)smart set because the Vizio performance was glacial at best. When I saw the Fire TV Stick on a half price sale it was a simple impulse buy. Two days later, I plugged it in, logged into WiFi, Amazon, MLB, YouTube and YouTube TV and I was up and running in mere minutes. Its performance is on par with my Roku. Although it would only work on the 2.4 band because of the distance to the router, the streaming performance is excellent.I really like that I can access all of my commonly used functions on the Stick's remote control, including power toggle and set volume. This means that the Vizio's remote can now live in a drawer somewhere until the batteries explode. Remote functionality is also on par with my Roku. I love the fact that the Stick's remote doesn't have dedicated streaming service buttons like the Roku which gives it a cleaner look. I also don't subscribe to any of the Roku's four dedicated buttons' services, but I digress. The Roku remote does have a headphone jack that I have occasionally found helpful but I don't miss having it with the Stick. I do, however, love the fact that the Stick's remote has a mute button. Roku has volume but no mute. I have not enabled Alexa and do not intend to so I cannot comment on that functionality.",4,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I bought an Apple TV a couple years ago in hopes of enjoying online streaming. While the device is a nice piece of equipment, in my opinion it lost out to the Fire Stick. Setup for the Fire Stick was easy. I installed the stick next to another HDMI input, and the one thing I noticed about my Sony is that they certainly didn't plan for wide HDMI plugs. I was able to find 'slim' HDMI cables on Amazon which I included with the order.Unboxed, well prepared. Quality packaging. Instructions were top shelf and an 800 number is included because you have to call in to activate your Fire Stick. The serial number is attached to your order number. The whole activation only took 10 minutes. It was so easy to login to our wi-fi router then Amazon Prime. This opened up a whole new world of new apps that I didn't have on our Apple TV. We bought the stick mainly to try out Disney Plus. D+ loaded quickly. I started watching a Disney tv series and compared it to the 2 year old Apple TV. Compared to the Apple, the Fire stick was lightning fast. And it was excellent at displaying the action scenes. On the Apple TV, some action scenes started to pixilate and blur compared to the Amazon stick-- which kept up and played the movies perfectly.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

When set up the controller also works my TV On/Off, volume, changing channels, and even returning to the previous channel by pressing the center button, you just have to experiment with it a bit to find out what does what. The only thing I came across during set up was syncing the remote which is the first step.

However, I have Alexa devices all over my house (dots, flexs, lights, switches, etc) and I rely on them for everything; so maybe my expectations were too high - but the biggest disappointment was how the Firestick did NOT integrate to my other Alexa devices.I honestly thought I'd open up my Alexa app after installing the FireStick and there would be an opportunity to 'add' it to my Alexa app, and therefore my Dots & Flexs…. nope, didn't have the option, didn't find it in a 'discover' and to use it I can't just speak to my wifi virtual no-touch devices - I literally have to hold the FireStick remote and push the button and only then can speak for the FireStick Alexa to hear me.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0

I grew to hate it more and more and more.First, the shape, terrible.  I can't tell which side is facing the TV and which side is facing me when I'm not looking at it.  A remote, by definition, should be used without looking.  Something simple, yet so frustrating.

Tried it on multiple other TVs, swapping out power from other sticks we have (all TVs are running a fire something at our house) and this one is now just a $40 dud.

Unfortunately I had no idea commercials would even be an option or I would continue to just watch prime on my phone and not have even bothered with the stick. If the stick was free and so was prime fine. I would understand the constant commercials but it is not and I did NOT pay good money to have my shows constantly interrupted. This is crap and makes me want to return it and get a fire stick off the black market instead already loaded with movies and shows that wouldn't subject me and my family to this constant interruption, and I mean constant.

The hook-up instructions are plain and it works as described. The picture quality is upgraded from what it was on the Blu-ray player, we have Closed-caption where we didn't before, it is much easier to restart a movie that you couldn't finish,  it is much easier to search for a particular scene, and the rewind function works much better than on the Blu-ray.

"Have you ever wanted to control your TV with your voice? Not only that, but you get to do so many other things with this product that you just got lucky for discovering. This product can bring you so much joy and relaxation. Before I tell you more of the wonders of the Amazon Fire Stick let me tell you a little bit of its background. There are different generations of the Fire Stick, but the amazing one I’m talking about is the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K. It was released in October 2018, which shows that it’s pretty new. It’s very modern and easy to connect to your TV! What are you still doing here? Go buy it! Anyways, I know some of you are still here so here are some specific reasons why you should definitely buy the product.Before I tell you my reasons I’m going to tell you what caused me to buy this product. I bought the Amazon Fire Stick for $40 and it was totally worth it! I tried it because I barely used the TV before I bought it! The reason I barely used the TV was because I barely had any channels on the cable and I don’t watch the news. I knew that the Amazon Fire Stick had many apps included and it’s made by AMAZON, come on, that’s a steal! In addition, I heard it was controlled by your voice and it was true! This product made the TV not only just a screen but actually made me want to use the TV. You can count on this being a valid review because I am a trustworthy or credible consumer. One way to prove that is that I like to try new things. Another way to prove it is because I use the Fire Stick literally every day and it made my life less boring. If you know me I will let everyone know if something is a good product or not. Finally, I’ve had the Fire Stick for a while now and still like it! As shown above, now you should know my background story with the spectacular Fire Stick and why you should trust me!",5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"I bought this stick recently after months of struggling to get our supposedly high-end Fire TV Cube to show 4k Prime Video content on our LG OLED TV (model LG OLED55C8P), and eventually was forced to conclude they just weren't properly compatible with each other. I'd turn on the system and the TV would report no video from the Cube. I had some workarounds but all of them required me to downgrade the stream for viewing.Anyway, I waited until the Stick 4k was on sale, swapped that in, and no more problems. The picture is super-sharp and there's not a single glitch or hiccup when I watch 4k content—both Prime video, and even with the Netflix app. I turn on the TV and the Fire TV Stick, and the TV immediately says it's receiving a Dolby Vision signal. I hope eventually Amazon finds and fixes the technical issues with the Cube because I did like that device, but for now if I had to pick one or the other, it'd be the Stick, no question.

When that one died - or at least I thought it had died it stopped working on the network and all troubleshooting was unsuccessful - I decided to replace it with the 4K.  My local wifi service had improved its sustained speed so based on the numbers it should work.  The problem?  When I got the new one it would find the network, then it  would  start to contact Amazon and then stopped.  The error message?  ""cannot reach amazon.com please check your network.  . ""  After research I  found the most common problems were 1) poor  wifi signal 2) router channel  issues.  I focused on these two problems I purchased a signal extender/booster and it worked fine but no change in the firestick situation. I spent three (3) hours on the phone while working through the router and my internet provider to test the channel issue.  Still didn't work.  Finally I broke down and bought a Roku.  In 15 minutes I was up, running, watching all  my channels and no lag, not logon issues, nothing!  Just my programs streaming.  My current theory is that the issue may be systemic.  Perhaps the ISP or their router is selectively refusing these devices or something in the protocol.  I have no answers and I cannot invest anymore time in a search for them.  But if some one from Amazon reads this, please know I love you products and your services, but you may want to see if someone (some network) is throttling or otherwise interfering with this type of device.",1,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
Before I purchased this device I had 2 separate conversations with Amazon Customer Support (ACS) on two separate days. I was assured multiple times in each conversation that I can play downloaded (using Amazon Prime shows downloaded to the Prime App on my Samsung phone) videos WITHOUT an internet connection.To add some background I have satellite internet with limited data. With this internet plan I have extra data that I can use between 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.I use this time to download videos to my phone. These downloads are what I am trying to play on the Fire device...Amazon shows-->Amazon App-->Amazon Fire Stick. What could go wrong?,1,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I bought the Fire Stick because Amazon no longer services Sony Blu-Ray.  I use a 9 year old Sony Bravia TV and Sony Blu-Ray DVD player which, until now, were problem free.  I installed the Fire Stick.  It did not connect to Wi-Fi right away.  It kept searching & searching & searching.  After shutting down and restarting the TV a couple of times and getting the same message, I decided to let it reset over night.  This worked.  When I turned it on the next day, I got the Wi-Fi security screen, entered my password and was immediately connected.  Another problem was with my wireless Sennheiser TV headphones.  I could not use them with the Fire Stick.  After repeatedly checking the settings and posting my problem on the Amazon forum, I found my answer at the Sennheiser website.  Sennheiser recommended a digital TV converter which was no longer being sold.  I ended up getting Blu-tooth headphones which were cheaper than a digital TV converter.  I found this entire process to be very time consuming and confusing.The Fire Stick uses the term ""apps"" for ""channels"".  Amazon Prime still uses the term ""channels"".  This was also confusing because I wasn't sure where I was suppose to start when I added the Criterion Channel.",4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I don't use alexa, so could not give a fair rating. Would have liked more information on all the firestick capabilities.  It has many which I will research and implement over the winter months. Prefer hobbies over sedentary boob tube watching. This works fine for my limited use. So easy that I was able to set it up. Remote is small, easily misplaced in cushions & covers. A 2nd remote would be a nice option. Making a 2nd purchase to eliminate cable altogether. The additional cost of TCM, while considered a nuisance fee in the industry that consumers will grudgingly pay & accept made me more determined to ""cut the cord"". Happy to eliminate foul language & offensive channels from my home. Let others pay for the privilege of being offended. Thank you amazon for offering at a reasonable price.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
"I got the device because the rural cable TV was too expensive and would have required another upcharge for channels generally included with cable services such as Spectrum.  The internet service they provide was sufficient for streaming.  I retained internet service and installed Amazon Firestick.  There were some initial issues involving splitters where the signal came into my house.  The technician reworked the connection devices outside the house.  With Firestick I was able to use Hulu at around $45 dollars a month.  I am also able to use Netflix and Amazon Prime.  Once the signal issues with the internet connection were resolved, it worked fine.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,2,0

I recently upgraded to the FireStick 4K from the original FireStick. I don't have a 4K TV but I liked the new features offered on this product. Shipping was a bit slow due to COVID issues but it arrived fast enough. The batteries shipped with the device were dead but luckily I had some AAA batteries at the house.Setup was a breeze. I wish there was a way for the new stick to automatically pull in all the apps I had on the old stick but instead I had to download manually. I could immediately tell a difference in speed. The old stick lagged when I would choose a show or an app but this new one is smooth and fast. I really love that the new remote has volume control for my soundbar. That's one less remote to worry about. There's also a power button on the new remote that will turn everything off for me when I'm done. That's a little thing but nice to not have to power down each device separately.,5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"So  with my purchase of a new LG 4K 82"" I wanted to improve the picture quality for streaming apps which is the majority of our viewing.  All my devices including cable connect through my Onkyo audio/visual receiver.  I have found the picture quality through the Onkyo to be better than directly through the smart tv.  Formally I used Apple TV device to connect to Netflix (4K subscription) and YouTube.  Since it was not the Apple 4K version I figured there would be improvement with Firestick 4K.  After first installing the new firestick and moving the old one to a guest bedroom I found the Netflix picture to be much worse on the new one.  After researching, I changed the option on the new firestick from default HDR to dynamic - remarkable picture improvement! So, comparing the picture quality from Apple TV to Firestick 4K, I give the Firestick a marginal notch above the Apple for one reason:  A huge improvement in visual noise.  Could this be due to Dolby Vision?  Possibly so.  To some extent this may be an unfair comparison because I'm comparing the Firestick 4K to the older Apple device.  Honestly though, the clarity and resolution of the picture is about the same, but almost all of the noise is gone on the Firestick.  And the deciding factor for me was that the Apple 4K device is significantly more expensive,. I would have given the firestick 5 stars except for one issue:  The equipment control option.  I do not want my input to shift to the firestick everytime I turn my system on.  Unfortunately with equipment control turned OFF, it is flakey and still comes on about half the time.  Finally, I do not use voice control or Alexa so no comment on that.",4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0

"I've been a Roku guy for a while.  Great interface, ease of use.  But the Roku's don't last that long, and I wanted to try an alternative.  I'm glad that I did.  Based on the reviews, I skipped the basic firestick for the 4K for the better chip and memory, and I think that was wise.In comparing the 4K to the Roku Ultra, which is twice the price, I think that the two are basically equivalent, with some features going each way.  The higher end rokus, including the Ultra, have a remove that had a headphone jack - that's a really nice thing when you want to watch some TV at night when the kids and/or spouse are sleeping.  The biggest benefit of the Ultra, besides not being a stick so having some more space for cooling and component parts, is the button to find the remote control - which, if you have young kids, you know can be a major time saver.  We use that button two or three times per week. And the Roku interface is, IMO, cleaner and less obtrusive - as opposed to the fire interface that pushes other Amazon products on you (but what do you expect... well, aside from a microsoft Windows/Explorer bundling style anti-trust lawsuit at some point in the future).  I'd compare it to something like iOS or ""stock android"" vs. some manufacturers bloated android overlays.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0

"Having been a loyal customer of the Roku for many years, and paying like $99 and more for their devices, I was super hesitant to purchase this similar product for about 2/3rds less money. But WOW, this Fire TV Stick works great! Now, I do not have a 4K tv yet, but I did get this in case I purchase a 4K tv in the near future. First thing I noticed right away is how CLEAR my old tv picture looked with this new Fire Stick as opposed to my Roku. I'm not sure why the pic is clearer with this, but it is. I can get all the channels I used before, but I found more on the Fire Stick! The setup was super easy. With my Roku I couldn't control the tv volume, but with this new Fire Stick, I can. I love it, and will use the extra savings $$ to buy myself something nice for me! (my tv by the way is a Vizio that is I think 4yrs old).  Excellent purchase.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0
"After decades of using cable or satellite TV service, we finally cut the cord.  TV service alone was costing us $120/month.  We've had an antenna on the house for many, many years so we were always able to access numerous local channels regardless of a TV service.  Still I really lived by my DVR via the local cable company; this was the feature I was going to miss the most.  It's been 3 months now.  I don't really miss the DVR.  (We can still buy an over the air one if we want to.)  Streaming via the Fire stick is awesome.  We bought two 4K Alexa variety.  There are more TV shows, movies, and documentaries, etc. than you can watch in a LIFETIME.  A lot of free.  And it is very clear if you need to rent or buy the streaming option.  Those that are not free, I've been checking out via DVD from the public library, if available.  Recently I discovered a PBS app which I downloaded to the Fire stick.  Again this is the free version.  Last night I watched the first episode of Chasing the Moon which aired on PBS in July 2019.  Free.  As a supplement to the Amazon Prime streaming, we do subscribe to a Disney+/Hulu/ESPN bundle directly from Disney. We like Disney movies and my husband loves sports.  I've used Hulu a lot as well.  The Disney+ bundle is $13.70/mth includes tax.  So, for $23.71/month - Amazon Prime and Disney bundle (vs $120 per month for local cable) we get everything we want.  Oh, sign up for the 30 day free trail of Amazon Prime first.  Then when I went to sign up for Prime a couple days before our trial ended, Amazon gave us ANOTHER 30 days free before our subscription started.  Wow.  So we got 14 months for the price of 12 months.  I'm very impressed by streaming TV.  I don't miss the DVR.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"A little background:I stream everything and do not have cable. Have been running two Nvidia Shield (2015) boxed for a few years now. They were so impressive I tossed the old Firestick in the junk drawer in the kitchen. The only turn off with those is the inflated price. I think no streaming device should be $100+++. I have also played with a few chinese boxes, they all SUCK! They claim 4-8gb ram and quad-octa core processors, and they ALL lie about this! With those specs, they ""should"" out perform the shield with a meager 3gb ram, however there is no comparison in performance.

It stays in the app longer if you disable screensaver but it still exits the app, I don't know how long 5-10? minutes back to the amazon home screen, the remote doesn't respond to the arrow keys when it is in screen saver you have to press back/home and then you are lagging as the firestick jumps around to places you didn't want to go.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I ordered this product to replace my 2018 Fire Stick.  I have been having increasing issues with the old Fire Stick especially with no sound on certain apps, video and audio being out of sync and some app functions not working.  While some of these issues may have been within the apps themselves, I found that the quickest resolution was to restart the Fire Stick.  However, the issues would always return sometimes weeks later or the next day and occasionally I would have to reset my old stick to Factory Default. After multiple attempts to troubleshoot the problem, I was left with either live with it or buy a new Fire Stick.  I got a really good deal as a Prime member so I opted to buy a new one, at least for the TV I use most often.Firstly, the stick is slightly larger than the old stick.

"HBO NOW and HBO GO were recently discontinued.  HBO GO is now HBO Max - but since Time Warner and Amazon have been unable to strike a licensing deal, Amazon Fire TV doesn't support HBO Max (which I get free with my cable subscription).  If you want to bite the bullet and pay $15/mo for just-plain-HBO (the successor to HBO NOW), you'll have to create a new email address just for that subscription - because your old HBO NOW account (and your old email) have been converted to an HBO Max account - which Amazon Fire TV doesn't support.  Yes, to keep watching HBO you have to sign up for a standalone paid HBO account through Amazon and create a new email address to do it.  (Just-plain-HBO, by the way, has a limited library compared to the more complete HBO Max.)Amazon shouldn't be advertising the Fire Stick as compatible with HBO, this is deceptive.  I'll update my review when this issue has been resolved - if I don't return it and buy a google chromecast first.",1,1,2020-8-10,1,2,0
"This is a good tool to stream movies and music. After I got one for our bedroom, I bought a second one for the den to replace the old method I was using to stream movies down there. I gave it four stars rather than five because nothing is ever really perfect or has no room for improvement. I rarely, and I mean rarely, give anything a five star rating for that reason alone. Having said that, this little Fire Stick is pretty darn great. It improved picture quality and streaming speed, plus I can listen to music that I had no access to before with the old system. Set up was easy. Easy. There are no subscription fees or anything resembling that. You buy this gadget one time, plug it in, connect to your network and that's it. You use apps that you are already paying for. It took about 10 minutes to get it all plugged in and ready to rock. Then, just follow the prompts. A lot of apps come included with it and some of them are free. No extra charge if you already have those services. Some DO cost extra, so just pay attention with that when you're choosing your apps. Some are free with ads, so those are just like regular TV. It comes with an HDMI extender if your port is in a tight place. It's about 4"" long and bends fairly easily. I used it on my TV that's mounted on the wall because the Fire Stick would not fit other wise. The cord to plug into your electrical outlet is detachable from the Fire Stick. I didn't measure it, but I think it's about 6 to 8 feet long. Overall, this was a very good purchase and I'm happy with the results. Especially for the price. The improvements I got are impressive for under $50.",4,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
"I was using the Roku 3, an older Roku. I decided to give the Firestick a try. I think the stick picks up the internet better then the Roku. I had some apps that buffered more with the Roku and seem to work better with the stick. What I don't like about the stick is the availability of apps. I know there has to be advertisements, but I would like a blank page and I can chose my own apps to be seen. Also I don't like the fact that I have to log out and my family log in to use their Prime. We don't like the same apps. Now I am thinking about a newer version Roku. I agree with some of the reviews about turning the the TV off. I think the stick should be disconnected from the internet when it is turned off, as should the Roku. I think the newer Roku's do now.",4,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0

"Someone else wrote about some of these same issues. Firestick 4K kept restarting by it's self and kept loosing server connection both hardwired and via wifi not to mention it was signing me out of my account so I had to sign in every time it restarted. Plain and simple is it just crapped out but here is the fun part; I spent 2 hours on chat with support in a good faith effort to try and fix the issue. When everything failed and it was clear it was unrepairable here is where I was left; I bought the Firestick 4K 1 year and 29 days ago so 29 days out of warranty. The rep was good (so I thought) at first he offered me 15% off a new one but when asked if he could do something more because it was only 29 days out of warranty. He told me he escalated the issue and requested I be sent a new Firestick 4k and I would get an email in 2 to 3 days. Great! right? Hold on....After 4 days and no word I contacted chat again and was told it was being addressed it was just taking longer then usual and I would get an email in a day or 2 and even sent me an email confirming the 1 to 2 days. Well here it is a week later, I have heard nothing from them and here is a kicker for you...I pleaded for them to do whatever they could to get it resolved sooner then later because I am disabled, live alone and hardly leave the house so tv is a big part of my outside contact. Well that's my story so I will just say ""good luck if you have to get help from Amazon support"" it is clear they are just saying what they have to in hopes you go away.***Update***",1,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I bought this only because Amazon chooses not to make Apple + TV available on my earlier Fire devices.  It is not a featured app on this stick.  You have to download it off the web site.  Then, it allows you to access free Apple content right away.  To continue full access, you must buy the Apple + subscription, but it does not allow buying an Apple Subscription within the app.  It makes you find an Apple device (IPAD, IPHONE, etc.) to buy the subscription using your Apple ID.  I then had to delete the app and reinstall it using the Apple ID that I used to buy the subscription because there is no Apple sign in allowed except upon the original installation of the app.  This is all confusing, frustrating and time consuming.  It may be Apple's problem but puts you in the situation where Apple people say it is Amazon's problem.  Well, yes and no.  If Apple didn't have this block on buying within the Firestick device there would be no problem.  If Amazon promotes this device as Apple + compatible it should make sure the Apple app allows the Firestick to purchase the subscription like it does with their featured apps.  Otherwise, they should warn people that they are in for installation frustration until you can figure out what to do.  My preference would have been to use the earlier Fire devices I own to load the Apple app and not have to buy the new Firestick just to get the Apple content.  Now I own three Fire devices one of which was just to get access to Apple + TV.  The Firestick 4K works as advertised but this lack of coordination between Amazon and Apple makes it frustrating for the user.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Ok. This latest Firestick hands down has better streaming quality than our Roku device for the same money and having the Alexa integration is a bonus as well as having TV volume and power control once the unit is synced to our Samsung Smart that is a few years old. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that the home button, in my opinion, doesn't really do anything when you tap it. You have to use the back button repeatedly to actually get back to the home screen that appears when you initially start the unit. The only thing the home button is good for is when holding it down for a few seconds, a munu if all your downloaded apps appears. Ok, I'm not a software engineer, but home should mean ""home"" like the Roku is. And this is something minor but noteworthy, my wireless keyboard that is paired with my TV will not work with the Firestick. It does with the Roku and with other functions of the Samsung TV such as it's built in browser etc. I can't stand searching or inputting usernames and passwords with the on screen keyboard and toggle with the remote. Though it has Alexa voice recognition, there are times when an actual keyboard is more efficient and preferred.Lastly, it would be great if, when using the Firestick remote to turn on the TV, that it defaults to the Firestick as the source to use upon powering on. However, the TV will turn on and go to the source menu as it would if I was using the factory remote. So, I must then grab that factory remote to select the source for the Firestick and launch. It's just and extra added step that could be eliminated. If it can't be automatically selected by using the Firestick remote to power on, then at least put a source button on the Firestick remote so I don't have to fumble with two of them. Oh, First World problems.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"Bought this new FireStick 4K... well It did not go so well... wouldn't work,  Amazon sent me out a replacement' well it didn't work either, then another one.

I think that Amazon is so big that customers get lost in the transfer of information and all the explanations that one has to convey to them' I do thanks them for finally resolving the issue..

"I purchased 2 AFTV 4K Sticks as I use them with other pieces of TV gear such as a MythTV DVR connected to 2 HDHomeRun Extend Over The Air Tuners which allows me to record or watch up to 4 OTA Channels at once from our local market.  Some of these channels still are sending 1080i and 480i Interlaced video, and most devices will not provide any deinterlacing in the actual hardware device, but the AFTV 4K Sticks are suppose to now provide that function.  Overall, the deinterlacing function works pretty well.  I was using Kodi as my front end software with the Mythtv Addon to watch live and recorded local channels on the AFTV Devices and performing the deinterlacing within the Kodi software which did a fair job as well.  It's not perfect as I can still see some interlacing and jitter in the picture, but it's a little better than the software deinterlacing I was using.  The AFTV 4K Stick does seem much more responsive than my prior AFTV Gen 2 Stick and surprisingly, even a little snappier than my AFTV Gen 2 BOX which was a real surprise.  I also subscribe to Playstation Vue Access level which provides several ""Cable"" channels that seem to work well.  I did notice however that when watching Playstation Vue on channels like Fox News Channel, Fox Business Channel, etc where there is a streaming ""Ticker Tape"" at the top of bottom of the screen, the right to left motion of the ticker is extremely jittery and jumpy as is the associated video.  At first I thought it was my eyes, but when I put either of my original Gen 2 devices back into service and compared the video, the AFTV 4K Stick had a very pronounced Jitter which is very odd because I believe Playstation Vue ONLY outputs a 720P video stream, so it should be smooth as butter all the time, and it IS on the old Gen 2 AFTV devices, but rather jumpy on the new AFTV 4K Stick.  Hopefully either Amazon or Playstation can address this issue soon because it is a bit hard to watch.  I also tried watching the Fox News Channel and Fox Business Channel AFTV Applications, and the video and scrolling tickers are always smooth as butter on all of the AFTV Devices, so I'm not sure what is going on with that.  Anyway, I got them on sale on Prime Day, so If I get tired of them, I can always sell them used and get my money back and move on to something else.",4,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0

Amazon Fire won out for 2 reasons. I’m a Prime Member and have a Kindle and Fire TV supports HDR10, Dolby Vision, and HDR 10+. Roku supports HDR10 only. At least this is what all the techies online and YouTube advised for the best picture and sound quality. LOL. The Fire TV Stick took me 5 minutes to set up and I was immediately able to stream Disney Plus on my big screen TV equipped with a sound system. Picture and sound quality is awesome.

"Streaming quality is good, better than what you get in a browser many times. If you don't have a smart TV its worth it just for being able to close the 8 tabs in your browser from all the different streaming services, and the remote. Alexa remote also controls the volume, mute, power on your TV as it functions like a simple universal remote. It does not have volume control in software so if your TV's volume doesn't affect the line out, you have to control volume on your external audio device if applicable. The apps from the major streaming services are all very good.Alexa integration with the remote is good, but integration with Echo devices is pretty bad. Frequently if you tell an Echo device to ""Play (title) on Netflix"" it will say it's getting the program on Netflix but nothing happens, or it wont recognize the title. You'll also hear ""That is not supported on this device"" or ""Hmm, I don't know that one."" Simple commands like pause and play rarely work because Alexa assumes you're talking about your default music service.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I purchased this device because I had read that the all-new apple+ app was now included.  I have an apple tv box, but I find the tiny remote that came with it, along with the interface, extremely frustrating!  Not to mention that it takes an eternity of seconds (I know, first world problem) for my shows to start streaming!At first I was disappointed that I could not seem to be able to log into my Apple account--it would allow me to input my Apple ID and password, but then the screen would just freeze.  After several attempts, I found another comment mention that you needed to download the fire stick software updates first.  I downloaded about three software updates (why in the world I have to download each separately defies logic) before I got my Apple+ app to work!  I love the interface and I love the fire stick remote so much better than the Apple TV box!  Shows start quickly and smoothly.  There is one issue I cannot seem to fix, which is that most of my library TV shows do not appear under my library--I have to search for the show individually to be able to watch them.  It's not like I am not allowed to view my purchases, they just don't automatically appear under your library as you would expect.  Also, the sorting functionality of the app needs to be improved--especially when you have hundreds of movies to scroll though!  Finally, why is the VUDU app not included?  I have purchases on VUDU from studios that do not participate in Movies Anywhere, thus I cannot view them on Prime or Apple+!  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.

I am satisfied with it, I like it better than Sling. However I got my new tv on January 5th, and little did I realize that after 1/1/20, AT&T Now would no longer be compatible with Roku! I was so upset! I love the Roku TV, the picture is great and I got it on sale. I definitely did not want to return it. Nor did I want to switch streaming services. So I got this Fire Stick. People said it wouldn't work with a Roku TV, but it does. Just added the stick to an HDMI port and when I want to watch live tv, I just switch HDMI outputs to the Firestick. There's a guy on YouTube that shows you how to use it with a Roku TV. Not too big of a hassle. I still prefer the Roku format over the Amazon Fire Stick. I think it's just easier to use, but this works for now.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0
"It's hard to express how relieved I was when I got the Fire TV Stick 4K after using an original Fire Stcik. It is sooo much faster and easier to use.. That said, I have had issues with voice (which wasn't working initially, but is working now) and with conflicts between the Fire Stick remote and an Echo sitting about 20 feet away. Also, I have a problem with the Fire Stick that existed with the older Fire Stick: on my older LG TV (2015 model, I think), audio doesn't work unless I switch from external audio to internal audio and then back to external audio. Every. Single. Time. It's a pain, and not necessarily the Fire Stick's fault ... although my cable box does not have this problem. Other than that, it's great to get a 4K picture on my 4K TV. As for Alexa ... whatever. As many people have observed, Alexa has not evolved much over the years, and it's worse at finding the video content that you want than it is at finding the song that you want on Spotify, and I'm constantly frustrated how often it has problems with the latter. I might use it more often if I was using the Stick for regular viewing, but I get most of my services through the cable box, including Netflix and Amazon Prime (via Cox). I just use the Stick for Hulu and Disney+ at the moment, and because it's a pain I've used in primarily for Star Trek, the Mandalorean, and Hamilton. (All of which were good.) Bottom line: If you're using an old Fire Stick, upgrade, and if you have a 4K TV, upgrade to 4K.",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Lets face it, cable tv is getting more and more expensive.  My husband and I just can't afford to pay over $200 a month anymore.  We want to watch our shows, but we simply can't do cable.  My daughter and son-in-law showed us how to work a firestick, so we got this one.  It's so easy.  You download your tv channel apps and watch them on the firestick.  Most apps are Free, however some you do have to pay for.  My cable bill is $10 I pay for CBS All Access.  Highly recommend the firestick.  I've had not 1 problem in the year that I've had one.  I just purchased this one because we have another TV without anything on it and we are giving it to our granddaughter, so she's all set for Disney+ and other channels she enjoys.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0
"Well, it works. Got it on sale, hooked it up (to a Caavo Control Center- if you're not familiar with it, look it up, you can thank me later, np), works as advertised. Much faster than Roku Streaming Stick (albeit, Roku SS is about a year older, so...). Don't use voice recognition, nor Alexa so can't say much about those. But Netflix, Hulu, B/R, ESPN, Sling, Movies Anywhere, Fox Sports, Youtube, Prime... all work as advertised. One downside: there's no VUDU. You can sideload it, but it's all messed up.

"Have a first gen firetv box, first gen tv stick and 2 4k firesticks. The 4k sticks are very fast, millisecond lag on loading, no buffering and excellent picture. The 4k sticks have a better picture and quicker load times than the old firetv box, also so far neither 4k stick has frozen up like the old firetv box occasionally does. 4k Firestick way faster than first gen stick 6 second load times and blu ray player 20 sec+ load times. Using tp link c9 router with 100 meg service. All devices within 60 feet of router.Initial setup was a mixed bag. 4k stick automatically detected my network and prime account (nice) but would not proceed without trying to detect tv type. Could not skip this part (4k stick directly into HT receiver therefore no sound from tv). Seems like Amazon designers assume you want to give full control to firestick over your HT system. Had to go through many settings to turn off automatic control of other equipment. IMO too much tweaking for a simple addition of a streaming device to a HT system. I just want it to display video content.",4,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0
"So we went on vacation to Florida and rented a place with Not so Smart,  TV's....  all they had was Comcast...  and it Sucks!!  I'm telling my wife we're screwed unless I can buy a cable to stream my junk from my laptop to the TV...  Target,  here we come!!  So the girl at Target says...  just buy a Firestick and all your problems will be solved....  you guys have prime, sling, netflix...  Yep...  DUH!!!  why didn't I think about that and WHY didn't I bring our firesticks with us?  OHHH  I thought the place had smart TV's....

"I own the original Fire TV box and it has started to get buggy so I decided to upgrade to this stick. I read reviews that the 4K stick runs smoother than the cube so I chose the stick. The interface is very fast and smooth so no complaints there. A big problem is the streaming quality is not consistent. I would start out on a 4K stream and it would then downgrade to 1080 HDR. Then if I picked another movie it would play in Ultra 4K HDR. If I paused it, it would drop down to 1080. I bought a new smart TV and the prime video app played consisten 4K UHD HDR so I returned the stick. It should have come with a built in ethernet.",1,1,2018-12-16,1,2,0
I had the second generation fire tv stick. It was starting to lag and the fire tv 4k was on sale. I was contemplating whether to get this or a roku and settled on the fire tv stick because it was cheaper.This fire tv stick is so much faster than the old fire tv stick. I would often have trouble using disney+ and there was a slow response time for netflix and youtube tv. This one pretty much can cycle through different streaming apps quickly. This fire tv stick was also able to open up my ring cameras and show me the feed using Alexa voice control... something my old fire tv stick would buffer but never show the feed.,5,1,2020-7-19,1,1,0
"I  live in a rural area, no cable, no DSL and I will never use Hughes Net again. I get all me data thru my ATT unlimited. I hardly notice it when they throttle me. It's so great to be able to watch so much commercial free. Avoid the apps at all cost, unless your fine with your time being stolen. My time is worth more to me than sitting thru commercials. I buy the shows I want also. I make about $50 per hour so a show that has 10min of commercials is stealing $8.33 from me for every ten min of commercials. Purchasing a Season of, lets say, Impracticle Jokers for $19.99  pays for itself after 2.5 shows. If we consider my off time as OT then my time is worth 16.66 for every ten min and the purchase of the show is paid for in about 1.25 episodes. And I am not pi**ed of and fustrated.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I had an initial setup issue with blue tooth earbuds, but I got that resolved by buying an ethernet adapter. Apparently the Bluetooth earbuds were interfering with my wi-fi network. The only known issue for me now is the volume control when I’m using the earbuds. When I connect my earbuds, the audio from the TV is transferred to the earbuds (no sound on the TV) but the volume control and mute buttons on the remote do not control the audio I receive on my earbuds, the buttons are still trying to control the audio on the TV, even though there is no sound coming from the TV. The audio output to the earbuds seems to be fixed. I can control the volume with the earbud volume control on everything I’ve tried except Amazon Prime content. The volume control on the earbuds has no effect.The other thing I don’t like is this. I use a learning IR remote for the other HDMI inputs and there is no way to “learn” the Firestick remote on an IR remote, although I do like the simplicity of the Firestick remote. To bad there isn’t a way to control basic functions on other devices (other than volume and mute) such as change input, change channels, program guide, etc., maybe through an onscreen remote.",3,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"I like the idea of having something other than just regular TV to watch and Amazon Prime video was good. I find the remote almost too small, and easy to lose. I have to keep it in its box which is bright orange so I know where it is. It was also extremely difficult to open the battery compartment. There was even a You Tube video about this. Guess I wasn't the only one with this problem. The lack of instructions is annoying and I still haven't figured out how to jump around with the buttons. The FF and reverse just seem to keep going and don't stop until they've reached the beginning or end so I don't use them.  The Alexa feature is good in theory but it doesn't seem to like female voices. I have to yell at it. Last night Prime Video didn't work at all but I don't think it was the remote's issue. All in all I like having Prime Video but the remote could be better.",4,1,2019-8-15,1,2,0
"Fire Stick works great for the most part.What absolutely drives me crazy is that when you are scrolling through the movies you have purchased, it always goes back to your latest purchase when you exit from reading the plot line or watching the Trailer of a particular movie. It used to be that as you did that, when you use the back arrow on the remote it would leave you at the current place in the the list of movies instead of going all the way back to the beginning of you ""MY MOVIES"" list. I have more than 250 movies that I purchased. So if you've scrolled to movie 225 and select to watch the trailer and then press the back arrow, it takes you all the way back to movie #1 instead of at movie #225. Then you have to scroll all the way forward to movie #225 in order to keep scrolling to movies past #225. I hope I explained this well enough.",1,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Had a Roku 3 and thought it was great until i tried to side load apps. Roku doesn't want you doing that. Well dammit........ok, I have ro buy another streaming device. Not wanting to spend big bucks I opted for the firestick and let's make it a 4k....hahaha, rite (sarcasm). Well,  to my surprise the firestick blew the Roku away. I could side load 3rd party apps,  user the internet, stream video without buffering in 1080p and in the limited 4k content. Wow the 4k looks really good too. Did i mention the tiny footprint?  You can't even see the firestick,  it takes up 0 space since it connects on the back side of the tv, completely hidden from view.  All is good,  better than good,  but wait a minute. I don't think i have many apps loaded on the firestick but it is full.  What the &%$@!!, this thing should have 16 gigs min. not 8 gigs. 32 gigs would be even better.  How can they have made this blunder! I don't know if there is a way to remove the bloatware but that would give 2 or 3 gigs that the firestick desperately needs. Seriously, that is the only flaw I found and it's a big un. My review wouldn't be complete unless I mentioned that the remote is very well thought out for a minimal / simple device. You can get away with no keyboard most of the time by using the voice to text feature.  The firestick does a decent job dictating. The batteries last a long time and you don't have to point the remote directly at the tv to get it to work like my tv remote. The price has dropped over the last year and is a bargain that will satisfy your average user.Update: I decided to drop the rating from 4 stars to 3 stars due to Amazon removing the cast feature for Windows PC. Amazon supported casting from Windows devices in the past and for some unknown reason they pulled the plug. The only work around for Windows 10 devices is to use the ""connect "" feature available through the notification panel (lower right corner} of the window 10 desktop. The default setting is to duplicate the screens, however you can change this to extend display, which allows you to keep working on the pc screen while watching a movie on the tv screen. Basically you have 2 monitors. This is the only work around. since no 3rd party apps will work. Booo Amazon, Yaaaa Windows.",3,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"My older Firestick actually works better than this one. I bought a new Samsung 4K tv through Amazon, with this 4K Firestick from Amazon I can’t get the sound to match the video, like when talking on a movie the lip movement doesn’t match the sound. And the picture, for 4K, isn’t all that good. I bought the Apple UHD tv box, sound matches the picture, and way better video quality. But the Apple setup was $150., Amazon 4K Firestick I got on sale for $30. So way different price, but also way different quality.And, I don’t order anything from Amazon anymore that won’t fit in my rural mailbox, otherwise I get a note in the mailbox about a package in town, drive 30 miles to town and stand in line at the post office. Doesn’t seem to be anymore “two day delivery” from Amazon. No choice, they send me a vacuum cleaner through the post office, like they think it might fit in my mailbox.",2,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"I purchased this to replace a ROKU-3.  Both the ROKU and this remote is very difficult to manage with large male hands, constantly slipping and constantly hitting the wrong button.  As for the Stick's video quality it is very good.The Home screen layout is irritating because Amazon is constantly trying to push content that they apparently deem to be important....but it is in my way!  I wish there was a way to clean up the Home Screen and to prioritize the apps that I use without other suggestions getting in the way (there might be a way to do that but I have not found it).  Thus, I prefer ROKU's Home screen to this Fire Stick.  As far as I can tell all of the apps that I used on the ROKU are available here.  My issue with ROKU was that it was obsolete, technically speaking, when I got it.  I hope that this Stick includes enough memory to operate well.  The Alexa on this remote works very well.",3,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

It works pretty initially, and our Internet connection/ buffering is soooo much faster now.The screen/app has a nicer look to it, with options from all our registered accounts showing up on the home page. The TV/Blu-ray/sound system still aren't fully integrated, though. We still need to figure out how to get Alexa to talk to our TV through the Firestick. I think it's a network interface thing.

"I'm trying Amazon prime,but it seems like the shows I want to watch, I need to purchase. I wish I didn't have to go hunting for free content. I wish they would just. Separate pure Amazon prime and free content would already be included and downloaded so I could see what was available. I have picking clicking on something then it turns out I need to purchase or it's a subscription to Netflix,HBO or something  else to watch that show ,WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF AMAZON PRIME VIDEO?? WHAT IS IT OFFERING?? On cable or Netflix you don't need to go searching for free content I can download apps, but some off them are just junk ,bravo is just tons of real housewives.I couldn't even get NBC to work .(syfy'channel, ECT) they need to make it easier to use and include better content . I plan on using PRIME FOR AT LEAST 6 months since I order allot of. Stuff ,and I already bought the stupid stick, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. ITS A HASSLE.

"So I'm a huge Amazon fan. At least once a week you'll see an Amazon package on my doorstep. You can't imagine how it is during the holidays. We have been exclusively streaming in my house with FireSticks for 3yrs now and we all have our own Kindle Fire to use. So I'm torn about this because I love Amazon so much. But since we got the new FireStick with the remote that now controls the TV volume and the power button for it as well, we've had some issues on and off. We had couple of times around the new year that it seemed almost like it got stuck on the home button or it kept resetting itself maybe? It was strange but it finally seemed to correct itself. I thought about sending it back but it was working fine after that and I honestly couldn't say at that point that it was the remote that was to blame. I've seen what it was doing happen before. It's been doing just fine until last week when the volume buttons wouldn't work anymore with no clear reason for it. Everything else was fine. We ended up changing the batteries out to see if it would help and it actually did from what we could see. But then today, the power and volume controls were working but the other ones (home button, play, fast forward etc.) stopped working. Since we're not overly good with tech stuff, my husband again thought it was because of the cheap dollar store batteries that were put in it lol. So all he did was take them out and put them back in and all of sudden it was working again. So I have no idea honestly. I love the new buttons because my tiny humans were constantly losing either the FireStick remote or the TV one and it was super annoying. So only having to worry about keeping track of one remote has been great. On a side note, I'd actually recommend a case for the FireStick. It's helped us keep track of it better. But I'm just a bit disappointed. I was really excited for the recent changes but not if it's just gonna be working half the time. I'll likely reach out to Amazon to see what's going on but I'm just let down with this one I guess.",3,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I have used Roku devices for years with great results, but when I needed another streaming device I saw that this little Fire TV Stick was on sale so I thought I'd give it a try.  After using it for a couple weeks I am very happy with it. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one or recommend it to a friend, especially when it's on sale. It is very easy to set up. Just follow the instructions and it will guide you through the process. If you have Amazon Prime this little guy is designed to integrate with Prime Video and makes it easy to find whatever you want to watch. You can easily download and use most if not all the major streaming apps such as Youtube, Youtube TV, Hulu, Netflix, and many more.  I would say Youtube TV and Netflix (my two main apps) load and perform a little faster than my Roku Premiere, but My Roku is a few years old and the difference isn't huge but it is noticeableI like the voice integration a lot. Alexa is very useful. If I want to know the weather forecast while I'm watching a show I can just ask her via pressing the mic button and she will tell me the forecast and go right back to the show. In fact, if you want to know the capital of Hungary or the population of Los Angeles or many other useful (or useless) nuggets of information just ask her.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"I purchased this to replace my previous generation Fire Stick. I recently purchased an iPhone that offered free Apple TV+ and my old generation didn't support this application. I have been pleasantly surprised by this unit and some of the perks from the old one.  It's super easy to set-up, it's plug-n-play like the other versions. I love the new remote design. It's a bit heftier in weight, which I like, but still compact like the previous ones. I also love that they've incorporated an on/off switch for the TV as well as alignment with my surround sound unit for volume. It sets this up automatically when you start the set-up of the device.The negatives are minimal so far (I've had it for about a week). I have a Sony sound bar with a Sony TV. The soundbar can timeout from the Alexa remote. That means somehow the remote isn't fully functional to the wireless device. That's a bit disappointing since, I thought I could reduce having another remote out to watch TV. The voice recognition is spotty at times. It either can't find what I'm looking for or it just clicks on/off without responding. My house is an Amazon house, so I have Alexa with my Echo, Dots, Kindle and my phone. There can be overlap where Alexa can't decide which device you're talking to her on. I'm not sure if that's part of the issue here as well. I know there are settings to restrict which Alexa responds based on setting but it doesn't seem to work with the Fire Stick as well. The only other thing that was a bit of a pain was that I had to download apps again. Since this ties to my existing Amazon account and I have multiple Fire Sticks, it would have been nice if it recognized what I had already pre-loaded. Instead I had to search for the apps to download individually. I should mention that I have fully cut my cable. I use this Fire Stick to access the majors; Sling, Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, etc. Other than that, I've been happy with it so far.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I like the stick, processing is fast. Memory could be better but most of all there is no SD card slot and the memory is insufficient. After the Amazon bloatware there isn't much left.Most people are forced to buy additional devices to try and address low storage issues which are problematic as well. So, to begin with you need to install a SD Card or a thumb drive attached to the devices using a special 2 way cable OTG and USB. USB devices or the thumb drive can be attached to one available USB 2.0 but most people use a USB hub. Please note the stick uses USB 2.0 so even if you get a USB 3.0 your speed is limited.",2,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0

Having also recently purchased a fire tablet and been less pleased with the performance I was skeptical of another Amazon branded electronics device.

The remote paired seamlessly with my aging Panasonic HD TV and controls the power and volume on it perfectly.",5,1,2019-3-3,1,2,1
"I was hesitant to get yet another electronic to the many our household already has. But since one of my smart tv’s Amazon Prime Video app is no longer supported by Amazon, Amazon send me a $25 voucher to apply to a fire tv device. This plus finding the device with an additional discount, motivated me to buy it. And I have to say, I love it! My favorite part is that it allows me to consolidate several streaming options into one that includes my Prime subscription, Netflix, HBO Go, and it even allows to connect to DIRECTV but that connection is not as smooth as the others so I still need to default back to the DTV remote. Additionally I started using the Amazon Photos up and uploaded all my pictures from my smartphone (5,000+) and I can use them to set a customized screensaver. So when we are bored of watching shows, we just seat there watching our memories in photos. There are some other fun screensavers you can ask Alexa to search for like a thunderstorm (my favorite, not sure why), fireplace, beach, rain, etc. But there’s more, I signed up for the 90 day Amazon Music Unlimited trial offer I received with the fire stick and we are enjoying it so much. Alexa in the remote works fantastically and I’m considering getting the cube so we wouldn’t even have to press down on the remote to interact with Alexa but not sure I wanna spend the extra money there yet. Finally, the fire stick I ordered is the 4K and I have to say our old smart tv is looking its best.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"I got this thing a couple of years ago while on sale.  It was amazing what it could do for such a low price.  I assumed that they were trying to make money by sucking consumers into the Amazon universe.  However, I found out that was not all they were doing.  As we all know by now, these devices like Alexa, Siri, etc. listen to us all the time.  That was easy enough to fix, with a small drill to destroy the microphone.But that was not the end of it.  Through a pihole (a self-hosted DNS), I discovered how often this device calls home with information it has gathered on you.  I got more and more elaborate blacklists and regex commands to stop it from sending this information home, or gathering advertisements to shove down the throats of my family.  What is it sending?  Who knows.  But probably not just your viewing habits.  It can also snoop around on your whole network to see what your computers, laptops, tablets, phones, cameras, and all smart devices are doing.  So, I also needed to start isolating the firestick from the rest of my network.  And I needed to do these things without hobbling its abilities to do it primary functions.  This took time and work.",3,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

Now I just use one control instead of two different Samsung remotes. I don’t have cable. I only have high speed internet and a $27 dollar ultra thin digital antenna purchased through Amazon.

"I ordered what I thought was a new firestick (found out later it was refurbished) after a week the remote stuck, they sent a new one but didnt resolve the problem so I was sent a replacement  firestick and I returned my original.  Imagine my shock when I connect the replacement  firestick and it says Hello Robert! Instead of Tammy as the original did. To clarify my shock, Robert is my deceased fiance who passed 2 years ago in my house, I found him. He did not live with me and the laptop I ordered the firestick is not even a year old and my amazon account with the email connected to it was not made until months after he passed. How does this happen? I was traumatized everytime I turned it on and saw hello Robert. I am still dealing with the trauma of his passing in my house which is a different address than I currently live and I contacted chat last night when I felt able to cope with this situation. Everytime I asked to speak to a manager, ask for the general managers name and number, chat disconnected. I was on chat 2 hours repeating myself to 3 different chat connections to be told the replacement  was derregistered to me and registered to Bob's account, a dead man. I never got a reason other than someone from his family had to do it. Have I lost my mind? Is his ghost haunting me? No. Amazon messed up and somehow registered my device that is a replacement  and came to my house in my name same as original but they registered it to of all people, my dead fiance. So besides the trauma of bringing back the horrible memories of that horrid day, I lost all my free trials, have paid for a device 2 months ago,that I was able to only use full benefits for maybe a week. I would not have knowingly bought a refurbished one to begin with. The issue was finally resolved by resetting to factory reset, which could and should have been told to me in first few minutes of first chat. I never got a managers name, the general manager or ceo name and contact info and lost weeks of services and couldn't watch prime videos I pay for until very early this mo6.

"The setup was straightforward, easy and quick. I love how the device turns your HDTV into a smart TV without the smart TV cost. I gave the Firefox browser a try, but the Amazon Silk browser is SO much better. With the Amazon Silk browser I can save to favorites. I can watch any show that streams over the Internet such as a morning news show or a network show that streams at a later date using the Amazon Silk browser. I love all the app options and the downloader. I just can't say enough about how great this little tech device is for my TV. There are TONS of apps to download and all of the apps have different offers, i.e. free show or pay per view. Also, if you have a cable or satellite subscription you can get on firestick and download the app for that channel in your subscription. I prefer the app over the streaming service on the subscription because there are more viewing options.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"I don't have cable or satellite TV, just a TV with a DVD player. I decided that I might as well try The Fire Stick as I have Amazon Prime with all kinds of free programing included. I wish I'd done this sooner. I can watch shows that I began to watch but didn't get to finish for one reason or another. One example is the series ""Banshee"" which aired on Cinemax a few years ago. I'm not sure that I finished all four seasons but I know I missed a few individual ones so I can catch up now and not have to catch it at a certain time that isn't convenient for me. Not having to put up with commercials for the most part is a plus also. I just had a knee replacement a few months ago so caught up on some TV programs while in the hospital. Now I remember why I don't have regular TV after watching all the commercials that interrupt the programs. Between that and the recaps they show there can't be much more than 30 minutes of program in an hour of broadcast. All this is gone with The Fire Stick. I got the 4K upgrade after reading the reviews and it is great with my 24"" 1080p HD TV. The picture is sharp and clear and a pleasure to watch. I have a sound system hooked up and the sound is tremendous and room filling. I would recommend this unit to anyone looking to escape the bonds of cable or satellite and take control of what you want to watch.

I immediately installed it in my workshop, where I've been using an old Roku 2 XS (model 3100X) which is not compatible with a Roku voice remote (the Roku 2 mode 4200 is, however). I won't bother comparing the latest Firestick to the old Roku, but I will say that the Firestick remote made a bad first impression, but more than made up for it later. The FS remote is very small, and doesn't feel comfortable in my Sasquatch hands, and it uses the little AAA batteries instead of the longer lasting AA size. But the tactile feel of the buttons and control ring is far better for me than any of the Roku remotes. The voice recognition works great, and will do things I wasnt expecting. Ask for the local weather, or ask for the weather in any city. Ask for Abraham Lincoln and get a picture and brief history lesson. Ask for the local time, or for the time in London. It wont carry on.a conversation, but it will respond to a lot!Picture zoom and pan! Who knew? If you can find the settings in the many menus, you can set up the remote to allow zooming in/out of the screen. And if you're zoomed in tight, you can pan in all 4 directions to find the image you want! I love that!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"On my third 4k stick locks up constantly with at&t tv now.Several calls to amazon support and several Chats with At&t support has gotten me nowhere, each one blames the other. until this issue is resolved i can not recommend the 4k stick. The At&t app runs on 3rd gen pendant and a 2nd gen box also runs fine on a 50 inch Toshiba fire tv and a tlc 32 inch roku tv. Tired of repacking them up and sending them back to amazon so for now this one sits in the junk drawer,glad i didn't pay full price.",1,1,2019-11-4,1,2,0
"A friend recommended we get the Amazon Fire TV Stick.  The first port I plugged the Stick into configured fine.  For convenience to a power source, I moved it to another HDMI port.  Things did not go that well.  I called customer support and they helped in showing me how to reset the device but not much else.  After some experimenting I finally got the Stick to work correctly.  My receiver didn't shut off any longer when I pressed the Home button on the Stick control.  To reach a convenient power plug I have ordered a HDMI 3' extension to plug the stick into to extend the power adapter.  Setup and navigation is intuitive.  The device works well with our TV and receiver.  We are pleased and the convenience of having one remote to do everything without hunting extra option buttons is a real plus.  I do find the remote shape and size a bit uncomfortable to handle.  It is a bit too small and rounded for easy gripping.",5,1,2018-11-29,1,1,0
"I bought the Amazon Fire TV device in 2015 for my husband. He still has it in use. I never much messed with it.  I recently ordered a Fire Stick 4k for the Family Room where I watch more TV. I got to say this is a pretty awesome device. I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm sure it doesn't have everything per some peoples reviews. But it has quite a lot of apps to chose from, and if you already subscribe to them, like Netflix, Hulu ect. Adding the app and logging in is a snap. I got apps for everything I had so I can go to each one with one remote. The remote was the simplest thing to start with, it got my TV volume and on/off with out me setting it. How pleasantly cool. I thought I was in for some setting up. Then I just had to log into my Amazon account. Easiest thing I went through.  Picture quality is pretty amazing. No lag or buffering when watching. Our internet is not top quality but not the slowest either.  You can hook it up to a network browser app to your computer and access the internet. The features are almost endless. The only thing I would want on it that isn't there is My kindle e-books. I would love to sit and read my books on the TV not having to hold anything and just use the remote to turn the pages.  Especially in the winter when you are all bundled up. Well I guess I can dream. Amazon, Please make us an Kindle E-books app for your Fire TV stick.  But other then that I'm pleasantly surprised and happy with a very well put together device.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"I previously owned three original fire sticks, which at the time provided me with a good entertainment experience. However I just purchased my new FireTV 4k and I was impressed. The menus where easily navigated thru and I could see an immediately that the performance was much better. With the older models, they reported week WIFI  signal strength, however once I replaced the original I saw the new 4K reported a stronger WIFI strength even though I had not moved anything other than replace the older Stick.For the first two days, I played with the options and setup all of my viewing channels (Which will allow me to discontinue my cable box usage to save money), however on the third day my 4K remote for some reason stopped working . I tried all sort of options to see if I can get it to re-synch (even removed and pulled out the batteries and replaced them with new ones). This did not help. I started to think simple and check the posts where the batteries connect and under a strong light I was able to see there was a film on the contacts. I wiped them off using a Q-Tip and a tiny amount of alcohol rub, then cleaned them off using the dry end of the Q-Tip. This resolved the issue.",5,1,2019-2-12,1,1,1
"Over the years, I have employed: Over-the-Air Antenna; Cable; DirecTV; and Dish.  Fire TV Stick 4K beats them all -- that is when the same product is available.  EXAMPLE:  Pandora Music Service.  I have been very pleased with my Pandora stations received over Dish; that is until I accessed the same stations through Fire TV  Stick 4K.  WOW!  The quantum leap in audio quality equated to the jump from mono to stereo.  IMHO, this trait alone validates the worth of Fire TV Stick as an investment.  The return on that investment is the pure joy of the aural experience.  NOTE:  I SUGGEST THIS MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE WITH QUALITY AUDIO EQUIPMENT.Although I can't compare video from same source material, the video on the first season of Amazon's Jack Ryan would rate as the best seen to date on my Samsung 55""; plus, the surround sound reflected my audio comments earlier.",5,1,2019-7-6,1,2,0
"Greetings,The Investigation Discovery app makes you login to them repeatedly. With that being said, you get real comfortable watch a program, that has at least 12 commercial, every 15 minutes, which are the same commercial every single time that has absolutely not relevant to you at all. Then you change to another show and you have to login again. Logging in all the time is not fun. You have to copy a code that the ID Investigation Discovery app gives you, then you have to go to your computer and search for their website. Once there you enter your code, then you have to pick the cable service you have. After this has been done, it either lets you in or doesn't. If it doesn't work, you have to do everything all over again. Then you have to get a different code, which you have to play around with the app until it gives you another code.

I have owned several of the previous versions of Fire TV and Fire TV Stick and decided to upgrade to the 4K Fire TV stick because of the hardware improvements over the older versions. Secondly I was having a problem wirelessly streaming 4K with my second gen Fire TV. I had made several improvements to my wireless network thinking it wasn't providing a strong enough signal to stream 4K to this particular location but still had no luck. When the sales started over the holidays I initially bought one 4K Fire TV Stick to try in my problem location. After a quick simple installation I was up and streaming 4K without any problems. This Fire TV stick packs a lot of power in a very small package. I wouldn't waste money on the Cube unless you're looking to have an installed network jack or an Alexa voice enabled device. I liked it so much I bought two more when they had the 2 for $60 deal running. I would have given this thing 5 stars until recently when I tried to screen mirror to the 4K Fire TV stick. AMAZON! why would you remove that funtionality from this thing. This isn't a deal breaker for me but it might be for other people. I was able to easily get a functioning work around from the App store. Also the new remote is awesome. It easily integrated power on/off and volume controls with my TV (75' Sharp) and surround sound speakers (SONOS).,4,1,2019-1-2,1,2,0
"After 20+ years, I finally ditched my cable company! I'm using Sling along with this Fire Stick 4k and couldn't be happier! I do use Alexa all through the house, but I don't use it to control the TV (though I can, it's just more hassle than using the remote) nor do I use the voice recognition, so that leaves just the remote. The interface does have a learning curve to it. Honestly, when I turn it on (and the remote does turn on my receiver, TV, and Fire, all to the correct presets), I wish it would default to the channel guide instead of the Prime home page - and getting to the guide takes several remote button pushes - but the guide is just as easy as my ex-Cable company's DVR guide (once I get there). I also wish Sling (or whatever cable channel platform one uses) defaulted, instead of ALWAYS having to select it from the menu. That would be a nice option.I have HBO and Starz through Prime and the guide is great for showing only the channels I subscribe to.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
When amazon got into making streaming devices I was thrilled to finally see some long overdue competition to apple. Apple was making one of the best streaming devices built robust enough to last a lifetime. Enter FireTv !Maybe the name is giving it a lost vibe and amazon is proving to be incapable of making anything good out of the fire brand. Bought the firetv stick 4k and started seeing issues within the first three months. It had only one job to do ! keep a connection stable so that the cloud can take care of delivering content to viewers. Nope! Won’t Do!,1,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0
"The Amazon 4K stick is really the best value streamer when it is on sale.  It provides Dolby Vision HDR which is something you really should have if you are considering buying a new TV other than Samsung who still refuses to add Dolby Vision to their TV sets.It isn't the most powerful streamer.  I own a 2019 Nvidia Shield Pro TV which is the most powerful streamer in the market today.  But for one 8th of the price (when on sale, otherwise 1/4th) you can't go wrong if you don't need gaming or very high end features.  The picture quality for 4K and 1080p content is equal to my Nvidia Shield.  Although the Nvidia Shield will upscale 1080p content to 4K significantly better than the 4K Stick.",1,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"This unit replaces a 3-year-old Fire TV box, the old style one.  It has a noticeably faster processor and a slightly better picture, and is unseen behind the TV and therefore less obtrusive.  It also has more apps, some that the other unit doesn't offer.  (I contacted Amazon and was told some of the newer apps are simply not compatible with the older electronics in the ancient-by-comparison Box unit.)  And having ""4K"" (actually a misnomer, what companies call 4K is not QUITE 4K) capability will be a plus in the near future when I replace the TV which this stick now services.One nice feature is that the power button on the remote can turn on the TV; I can even turn on the TV by telling Alexa to do it!  And it's nice to have volume control on the remote, especially since the native volume of the Fire TV does not match that of my settop box (neither did the old Fire TV Box, it was way louder and not itself adjustable).",3,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"The Amazon Fire Stick 4K works great for my application.  I don't have a 4K HDTV so can't speak to this.  The streaming quality is very, very good for the 720p HDTV I'm using.  The pleasant surprise I've found is how much faster I can move around Netflix and Prime compared to my old way which was through my Blu Ray player's wireless to stream these applications which was very slow in comparison.  The Fire Stick 4K is extremely fast and I love the Home button to get all the way out immediately instead of repeatedly hitting the Return button as I had to do on my Blu Ray remote.  I've used the Voice Command a few times and seems to work fine.  It didn't recognize what I was saying at first but then did which is more going through a learning curve on what to say.  It will bring up a particular show name instead of me typing in the title through the search which is so much faster.Amazon sent an email on my Blu Ray player saying they weren't going to support it any longer while providing a $25 coupon.  I decided to get the 4K Fire Stick even though my HDTV isn't 4k so it will work later when I do upgrade to a 4 HDTV or get a newer processor supporting the Atmos sound.  So I got the 4K stick for $10.  Best money I think I ever spent, really worth the full price just to have the ability to move around so quick along with the Voice Command supported.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"This is my second Fire TV stick.  I lost the remote to the other right before Prime Day, so good time to upgrade.  I have it hooked up to a 10+ year old Phillips flat tv.  I bought it when they began to fall to a reasonable price years ago.  The quality of the Fire TV picture is great.  I will say that the programming being watched must also be in 4K for you to get the 4K quality, which most of us probably didn't think about.  It does not convert the programming up.  A couple times watching, the episode of the show being watched lost signal and took me back to the home Netflix stream.  I did not experience this with the old Fire Stick, so now sure why.  I have not had cable for many years now and this is good enough for me.  I only have Prime, Hulu, and Netflix (paid for by T-mobile) and I am satisfied as I watch less than 8 hours of tv a week; sometimes no tv at all.The only downside to the Fire TV is that if you do still have Comcast Xfinity or you subscribe to their Live TV streaming as I did about a week ago to get local news, you cannot stream it on Fire TV.  There is no app for it, no capability to do it.  I do have a smart tv that I could watch the Xfinity Beta app on, but the Fire TV remote and interface is better than my smart tv (which I purchased on Prime Day when I got the Fire TV 4K).  Therefore, I may cancel my Comcast Live TV, even though they gave it to me for $10 a month on top of my internet.  You cannot go wrong with this.  If you are new to no cable, give it some time to get used to it.  This is a good deal.  Prime/Hulu has excellent shows.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,1,0

I recently had to purchase a new streaming device after Roku stopped supporting HULU on one of theirs and I decided to go with the Amazon Fire TV Stick.  I will never buy another Roku product because they can just randomly stop supporting services on their devices and try to make you buy upgrades.  The Fire TV Stick was so easy to connect and set up with the exception of the voice recognition and Alexa.  I don't know if I have to be an Amazon Prime member to use Alexa but I am not and Alexa is not working on this device.  It doesn't really matter to me because I don't need it.I like the remote control on this item much better than the Roku remote because it pairs with my TV and I only need this one remote to turn the TV on and off and stream content.

Our TV also has Bixby voice control and an Amazon Prime app so we are duplicating efforts a bit.

"My order arrived on July 6th. We bought it because we couldn't stream the service we just ordered without something. We used it a total of five times between July 7th and August 8th. On August 9th it just stopped working. The remote wouldn't work at all. We did everything, replaced batteries, tried to re-pair it with the FireStick...nothing worked, it was just dead.

It kept losing the connection to the internet...off and on, off and on, yet everything else in the house was working, and streaming, just fine!

I looked online today at the ""details"" of my replacement...it's a REFURBISHED FireStick and REFURBISHED Remote. I understand that it's their ""choice"" what to do...repair or replace...on warranty items, but mine was 33 days old, 3 days past the RETURN date on Amazon. Is that the life expectancy of all electronics these days? Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful they're sending me a replacement rather than me having to send it in for ""repair or replacement."" However, I really think I should be getting a brand new one since I just paid the price for a brand new one not 33 days ago! Is is my fault that I got a LEMON?

I love this one, I haven’t had to reset it once, and I really could not be happier.If you have an older version of fire stick is giving you problems, it probably means it’s time for an upgrade.

"This was MY FIFTH Fire Stick! I bought my first one in 2014 and replaced it in 2016 because it went bad. Then I got two more in 2018 for two other TVs in my house. On all of them there is sometimes a streaming problem where movies or videos have to stop for a while, or sometimes stop completely. Lately however I have been using my stick to listen to Audible books -- and sometimes have a problem where a book will suddenly stop. I WAS HOPING that this new stick, being ""4K"" and all, would put a stop to all that disruption of viewing and listning -- but no - this one has  stalled no less than four times already on audiobooks since I installed it LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO!UPDATE - next day - So I got a call fom technical assistance after posting the review and am raising my star rating from 5 to 3 -- based primarily on the rapid response to my concerns. Turns out I should not have spent the extra ten bucks for 4K because it is not compatible with my TV which is NOT 4K -- Probably my fault for not knowing this - surely it must have mentioned it in the product info. As far as my streaming/buffering issues, tech help said the problem is probably with the app and I should try uninstalling and reinstalling the apps that are showing problem - the Audible app for sure and probably YouTube ... if anything else stalls out I will try to uninstall and reinstall the apprpriate app to see if that helps. In short, the new stick should work just about the same way that the other three, non-4K, sticks in the house - one of which is now a ""spare"" in case one dies. However, I am still annoyed enough about unnecessarily spending the extra $10 for a 4K stick that I am withholding the last two stars.",3,1,2020-5-20,1,0,1
"Some shows and channels never streamed very well for us. There would be lots of buffering or sometimes not connecting. I honestly never thought that our older model (other brand) tv box was the problem. Adding the firestick is like having a new tv. The image is much sharper, and we never have any trouble connecting. We also bought this for an older relative who suffered endless frustration trying to use three or four remotes just to watch tv. The Amazon Fire Stick has been a huge relief. She's told me many times how much she loves it. She can pick up the firestick remote and say ""Turn on the TV"" or ""HDMI2"" to change the input source, or just ""Go to Netflix."" (I know she can also just click the button to turn on or off the tv on the fire stick remote, but I think she likes telling it to turn on.) Frankly, I think the usual hodge podge of boxes and remote controls is punishing for older people to use. If you're the son, or son-in-law, you really should buy this for your older relatives. And for yourself as well.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,1,0
Like I said on my other post for the other forestick I just wrote a review on to me if you already have a first or second generation don’t bother to buy this it does not go as far as the others for WiFi it buffers all the time I have to reset it constantly and my first gen works at the furthest point of my house where the 4K won’t even connect the only thing that is better you have slightly more storage and the volume buttons on the remote itself I would rather buy the remote then the stick bc they say it’s better and faster but this is my third one bc I was going to replace my old ones w the 4K and ended up putting the 4K back in the box and using my first gen so yea if you have one already don’t waste your money on this it’s not worth it plus when I called in for a replacement after 3 months of use it was a huge hassle so just not worth it,1,1,2019-5-18,1,1,0
I had the previous model that is square with dongle and was pleasantly surprised with that model.  When the new 4k with voice remote was released I thought about it...but when they had the price drop I jumped on it. What a great device ... let me explain. Older versions were limited with lagging streams and lack of apps. These new devices are flawless at least for me. I do have faster fiber with faster wireless routers so experience may be different for others. The streaming is flawless and picture perfect on both 4k and reg sets. I watch the prime video and my wife has Netflix she watches often. Better yet i placed in the spare bedroom and with Dish app stream in that room all the standard channels and dvr (I do have sling with service) for free. I was worried it would be lacking but it is not. I now have a remote dish receiver that I purchased and every time i have company had to pay to activate and utilize now I will never have to pay for use again. How great is that... Overall this device is steps ahead of the older first generation and enjoying the new versions with voice remote. At this price it is a must have especially if traveling for business etc. If anyone interested in Dish discounts please ping me as well. Happy with current purchase and recommend to others,5,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0
"Ok, I love Firesticks. That being said, I replaced my old Firestick with this new version about a month ago because it finally quit working after almost three years. I thought that I'd be able to get all my old apps on the new stick... Nope. No big deal, I can get past that. But just last night the new Firestick locked up while I was watching Netflix. Couldn't get it to do anything. I had to unplug the stick then plug it back in, then it wouldn't even turn on. So, I finally got the fire tv logo to come up but it won't populate. So,the only thing I can figure is that it broke. I'm gonna get another Firestick, but I'm pretty perturbed that this thing is only about a month old.",2,1,2020-8-22,1,1,0
"Easy to install and log-in, and almost as easy to install streaming apps (the Roku is a bit easier in this area).  The device is reliable, has a crisp picture and works well, generally.  The area that I can fault is the user interface (UI).The UI is very ""glitzy"" with emphasis on color, motion, sound and cramming the maximum number of choices on the screen at the same time rather than clear information on each offered program.  A user wants to see several bits of information clearly and when they first browse the program:  whether the content is available ""free"" or as a part of their Prime subscription (when looking on Prime or some other paid ""channel"" accessed via an app on the FireTV device), or if there will be a rental or purchase; the user also wants to know what other viewers or reviewers have thought of the content (e.g., star ratings or review ratings), its genre (crime drama, comedy, etc.), a brief synopsis of the content - hopefully with an option to ""see more,"" the running time, and its rating (PG, PG-13, etc.).  FireTV shows only some of this info in the apps I have and then it is shown only after you go down to the second level after you select a program or third level before you play the content.  If you decide you don't want to play that content and ""back-out"" of the selection, you go back to the top-level display of all offerings but your ""place"" in browsing the offerings is not preserved - - you need to go look for where you were when you tried the selection that you ultimately rejected.  I call this a ""punishing user interface"" because it causes you to do a lot of work to recover from any mistake or dead-end that the UI itself leads you into.  This and other UI annoyances make the FireTV UI less than a 5-star rating.  But to be fair, neither is Roku's UI something you are going to write a rave review about.  Maybe Google or Apple has done better, but I don't have these to comment on.",4,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"I love these devices.  They are amazing and connected to the Recast and a streaming service, we more than we had with cable and TiVo all at a much lower price.  Combine this with the power and volume buttons on the remote and the integrated Recast DVR (500 gig multi-room TiVo device) make this well worth the price.  Using Alexa on the remote for your smart home devices is icing on the cake.  Even with our SmartSmsung TV we use this for DirecTV Now (AT&T) as the Samsung app has problems.  It is unfortunate that it does not work with YouTube TV yet.  It is important to get this released as soon as possible.One minor complaint is more a function of Alexa than the Fire Stick. There does need to be some better identification of the target device for Alexa.  If you link your Echo Dot to the Fire Stick, any request to play something defaults to the TV, even if you just wanted to play something on Echo.  Alexa also has no concept of multiple locations tied to the same account.  If you are lucky enough to have a second location, Alexa can't isolate the devices and commands for each location based upon where you currently are.",4,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"Bought this as an upgrade for an older HD model that started getting spotty wi-fi reception after a year of use. The spotty wi-fi reception seems to have been caused by a system update, n9t a failing device. This kne worked fine for the first hour after installing until it decided to update, after which I started getting notifications that my signal was weak and had to restart the device (same fix I used on the older model).The voice recognition works well... when it decides to work that is. Voice recognition goes in and out at random, I'll get the 'ding' in response to hitting the button, but it will randomly refuse to acknowledge that any verbal commands were given. The voice recognition on the older model still works perfectly.

"I was really frustrated with getting this setup.  I do not have a Smart Phone and am not as well versed in high tech gadgets as I am with computers.  The instructions were not very clear to me.  I had no idea what ""pairing your Fire Stick and remote"" meant.  And I was at a loss as to how to get to the setup screen.  But I did some troubleshooting based on my computer experience and finally figured it out.  Technical writers for the Fire Stick should not assume everyone purchasing one is familiar with all forms of technology.  Just a few illustrations and sentences of step by step instructions are all that would have been necessary.Now that it is set up, I am thoroughly enjoying the streaming experience.  The picture is nice and clear, as well as the sound.  Usually I have to have the volume way up when watching regular TV, but it is very loud and clear. I have not used the voice recognition, as I don't feel comfortable with Alexa.  Navigation is pretty easy once you get used to it.  I love that you can stop it in the middle of the movie or show and you can resume it right where you left off the next time you want to watch it.  The remote is very small and has a slick surface and rounded shape, which makes it easy to drop it and hard to keep it in place if you lay it down.  It wants to slide or roll off your couch.  I have a remote caddy, and the remote doesn't stay upright as well as my other remotes.",4,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"The device itself is great if you are only going to use it for Amazon Prime related streaming and other applications as long as it is not Netflix.  I have had a horrible time trying to use this Firestick to run Netflix.Once I get Netflix to run it works fine, but getting Netflix to run on this device is a mission.  You basically have to clear data/cache, uninstall/re-install the application, disconnect/reconnect the power and if all else fails restore the Firestick to factory settings.  And the worse part is I have to go through this every single time I try to use Netflix.  If for example, I'm watching a show on Netflix, have to step out and turn off the TV, when I return Netflix will no longer work, so I will have to go through the steps all over again. I spend anywhere between  5 to 10 solid minutes going down a checklist and series of steps just to watch a show.",2,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"The 4k output looks good on the TV, and the unit is responsive to all commands. As expected, it has good integration with the Amazon ""universe""--Prime video, music, photos, etc (with the current exception of the Amazon Ring devices, which I understand they're working on). It has a decent number of the streaming services available, certainly almost everything I use. (I do have to switch over to my TV's Android OS for some of the Korean and Japanese streaming services some in my family enjoy--I didn't mark the unit down for this. It can't support every streaming service from every country in the world.)My one continuing annoyance with this 4k device, and for ALL Amazon Fire TV units (and I own or have owned most of them), is storage. Every app, every streaming service requires memory, and there isn't a whole lot. I've purchased several of the family game packs which my family enjoys when we get together, but I can't load them on my system. I'm constantly having to go into the apps, and deleting things I use in order to load something else I want to use at the moment. I was hoping that they'd at least add some kind of microSD support. I'll happily go out and purchase a 128 or 256 GB card to supplement it.  Bottom line is that it's just bad design. Their engineers are NOT paying attention to content requirements. And if I were to write this on an evening where I had to spend an inordinate amount of family time loading and unloading apps, I might knock this down to 3 stars.) This is the only real, solid negative to this device. And it's extraordinarily disappointing that they haven't addressed this even in the latest versions. (The Cube has a whole 16 GB. Nice try, Amazon, but a definitive and resounding NO! If you don't want to put 128 GB in the unit, then give us a microSD slot so that we can add it ourselves.)",4,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
At first this was the best player I've tried.  It can play everything without any problems like buffering except that it tends to overheat!  It doesn't feel hot on the outside but after it quit several times I removed the plastic cover and it was very hot inside!  I stuck some heat sinks onto it and now it seems to be working OK but why didn't they check the design to see if it's going to overheat before they start making and selling it?  I've been in contact with Amazon Tech Support about this problem but they have been NO help in providing a unit that doesn't overheat!Another problem is the resolution of the display won't stay set!  On Amazon when there is a 4K stream it tries to change to 4K each time even though I've gone into the menu and changed it to 1080P several times to save data.,1,1,2020-6-2,1,0,1
"I was hoping to be able to provide a much better review on this.  I own numerous Amazon Fire devices including 5+ Firesticks, 4 of the Firestick TV HD (that seems to have disappeared from existence in the Amazon device offerings), the Fire TV, multiple generations of Echo devices and too many fire tablet and readers to list. I also have several competing devices but will focus on this device as it compares to the prior Firestick and latest updated device. I tried this on both a 4K UHD Utra 60” Tv as well as 2 other 1080p (plasma and LED) displays of equal size. Unfortunately I did not see any improvement in quality to the image display. The same quality was received by updated (less expensive non-4K) version.On a positive, I do appreciate the addition of the power off button on the new remotes as well as the ability to control the volume from the fire remote. I have not had an opportunity to test if the new devices can be controlled independently through a multi function smart remote such as a Logitech Harmony but will look into that next as well as if the new remotes can operate older Fire tv devices so they can also benefit from the power on and off as well as volume control.",2,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"Gave this a try for the first time. It’s fast, Alexa is useful, provides great picture, no lagging, it controls our soundbar which eliminates another remote.But it doesn’t deserve full stars and here’s why, putting batteries in is a pain in the butt, they seriously need to redesign how to open the back, I wish they had app buttons on the remote like Roku does, just hit the Hulu button and bam, your there. They need to streamline their home page so all your apps are easier to see and get to without seeing a bunch of show/movie suggestions, Roku does a great job of just keeping it simple!",4,1,2019-6-10,1,1,0
"I'll preface my review in saying I bought the Fire Stick 4K specifically due to it being necessary to manage the Fire Recast (over-the-air channel tuner / DVR) I had also bought.  It's functionality in managing the Recast is why I gave it 3 stars, as it does this part very well.  (If you're buying it for the same reason, I touch on that part at the end of my review).However, if I'm judging the Fire Stick 4K as a media player (it's main function), unfortunately I would have to give it only 1 star.  I'll start by saying I have a Samsung 4K TV with the necessary HDCP 2.2 HDMI input.  I also have a quality WiFi router positioned very close to the Fire Stick with a solid 5GHz connection.  For all other inputs (DIRECTV, Xbox One, Apple TV, etc.) I use roughly the same video settings with great results.  However, the Fire Stick 4K had an instantly noticeable dark, soft image (no matter what the video source) and washed / flat colors.  I worked for quite a while on tweaking the settings between the Fire Stick and my TV to achieve the best picture possible, but it's still far from good.  The biggest impact I achieved was from turning the Fire Stick's default HDR setting from ""Always HDR"" to ""Adaptive HDR"" and simultaneously turning my Samsung TV to the ""special viewing mode"" of ""HDR+"", which is odd because it seems that reigning in the HDR on the Fire Stick while simultaneously enhancing HDR on my TV would be counter-productive, but for whatever reason it gave me the best results.  Still though, this only fixed the picture enough to make the signal from my new HD antenna / Fire Recast combo tolerable enough to live with and avoid a cable / satellite bill, but far from ideal.  I learned quickly that I definitely won't be using the Fire Stick to stream Netflix, Prime, Hulu, UHD movies I own digitally, or basically any streaming video beyond the OTA channels I need it for.  Which is a real shame as this is, after all, intended as a 4K media streamer first and foremost.  (I'll be using my Apple TV and Samsung SmartTV apps for those, as I did before.)  Sad, because it actually has extremely smooth set-up, it functions excellently in terms of usability, and I love the remote.  Everything about it is great except the one most important function:  picture quality.",3,1,2019-5-3,1,0,0

"Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV & Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating.

"It works ""okay"" but it does have some issues.  Every now and then it gets dumber than a box of rocks and ""forgets"" the remotes paired with it.  When it does that, you have no way of navigating to the Settings to repair the remote.  The only thing you can do is unplug it from its power source, count to fifty and then re-energize it.  after it goes from a cold boot, you regain functionality of the remote that came with it and then you get to reconnect your other remotes.  Mine also likes to reboot on its own.  In the middle of a movie right when you get to the part that makes the previous hour come together, bammo, the Fire Stick decides to do a restart.  Luckily, you can pick up where the movie dropped off but it kind of takes some momentum away from the movie.  Mine does it at random times so I don't sense it to be heat our power source related.  None the less, I'm putting an HDMI extension cord on mine, moving it away from the TV and seeing if that helps.As for integration with Alexa, my jury is out on that one.  I have an Echo Show that seems to get really confused when I ask it to open an application on Fire Stick or I ask it to launch a particular movie.  It's probably just a setting somewhere that makes my Echo Show not realize there is a Fire Stick it can control (Yes, it sees it under devices, it just doesn't know what to do with it)",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I have a FireTV 4K that dangles from the HDMI port. It was pretty responsive and worked rather well with my Vizio 47"" 3D (1080p) TV. However, when I purchased a new 49"" 4K LG, it never did fully integrate with the new TV. Every time I would turn on the TV, I would have to reboot the FireTV with the remote several times before it would come on. This was extremely frustrating and sometimes would take a half hour or more.With the new FireTV Stick 4K, I have never had a problem when I turn on the LG TV. It immediately fires up. It streams well, has excellent integration with the LG's 4K formats, including HDR and Dolby Vision, but I have not seen a response to material that is listed as 4K UHD. I don't think this is the fault of the FireTV Stick, but a limitation of the LG TV's 4K implementation. However, that is not an issue. I still get very good picture quality, both color and resolution, with HDR and Dolby Vision streaming, probably helped by the fact that my internet service is listed as 450 Mbps (maximum). I have read that streaming at anything above about 80 Mbps will successfully process 4K material, so I have plenty of bandwidth for those formats.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0

Seriously, it's that much better.Second, I don't understand why, but side by side on the SAME TV the Fire Stick has a noticeably BETTER image.  They both stream well, no skipping or buffer issues.

Using a speedtest app from the Amazon App store, the Fire TV clocks in between 10 - 20 Mbps download with a Ping response 50+ ms on average via a ""very good"" connection. While this is fast enough to stream most 1080p HD content, it is not fast enough to stream 4k content. By comparison, the Xbox One within the same entertainment center receives wireless download speeds in excess of 150+ Mbps.

I stumbled on a great Amazon deal and got it for $25.Update:  After using the Fire TV stick 4k for a few days, I continue to be impressed with the picture quality.  My only negative comment would concern the limited functionality of the remote control to navigate the guide in my Internet TV app.  There is no way on the remote control to tune directly to a specific channel number. The  navigation up/down ring will only move one line at a time to surf channels in the guide so going from channel 1 to 100 requires 99 clicks. Also navigating with the left/right ring one line at a time to advance the time in the guide from 7 pm today to 7 pm tomorrow  requires at least 23 clicks.  I hope that Amazon Fire TV can improve the functionality of the remote control.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

It works very well!  I can watch just about anything offered by the plethora of apps/channels available.  I use Netflix, Prime Video, PlutoTV, and Disney+ mostly, with a little History and SyFy.  Alexa integration is abysmal however.  ""The girl"" as we like to call her without arousing her attention, is dumb as a brick, and controlling the TV with it is just as bad.  About the only thing I can reliably do is ask her to turn on the TV...changing the inputs fails every time, either because she plays dumb, or says ""OK"" and nothing happens.  Another word of advice...get a long-range Bluetooth keyboard and link it to the FireStick4K.  Typing while searching using the remote is tedious, and the keyboard integration is very good.Overall, this was a good purchase.

"On the positive side, the streaming quality (@ 25 mb) was very good and the choice of live channels on YouTube.tv  would have met our preferences.  The Fire controller was easy to set up and paired with the tv easily.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa did not work at all for YouTube.tv.  When I asked for a channel or program, Alexa always activated the YouTube video library, not live tv.  We were evaluating streaming services as compared with Dish satellite, which we currently use and found the navigation to get to a particular channel awkward at best and confusing at worst.  For example on the Dish controller, once you know the channel number you simply enter three or four digits and you get the channel.  On the Fire Stick you either scroll through the channel listing, or go to the screen key pad and point the cursor to each letter in the name of the program or channel (awkward!).  If you happen to hit a wrong key or control on the stick you could end up in netherland.  More than once, I had to restart the fire stick because the home button didn't get me to the beginning.  Another annoying thing was that when the home button worked, which in fairness was most of the time, the Fire Stick home screen always showed a variety of streaming options.  It would have been nice if you could control what the Fire home screen showed through the Settings function.

"My wife and I were given two fire sticks for Christmas. Started out just fine. Then we began having issues with one of them. By following the help section and troubleshooting, we were able to fix the problem. But this issue keeps happening. Like I said we have two fire sticks. The one we are having the issues with is our main TV. The other one doesn't seem to have any issues. Although we don't watch that one very often.I'm really getting tired of this issue. The issue is this, the unit cuts in and out and then takes forever for it to regain the program. Or it won't load anything at all. It has also been resetting itself. You'll be watching a program and it just leaves the program and goes back to the home page. I really like this thing when it's working, but when it does theses things during programs it becomes maddening.Any ideas on how to fix this situation?",3,1,2019-4-24,1,2,0
"Although everything else is wonderful, this does not work with the Spectrum TV App which is my service provider so it is great for movies and streaming but I will have to opt for a Roku now because I would like to be able to watch my paid TV service as well.",3,1,2019-7-22,1,3,0
I dropped my cable company recently and went to Hulu. I do have a smart tv but I love that the fire stick kind of serves like a hub for all my tv apps. I like the addition of the live tab however Hulu channels aren’t on it. Philo channels however do show up so at least I don’t have to open that app to see what’s on. I also like that Apple TV is on here too as I have purchased digital downloads of movies in the past so it was nice to access without a different device. The fire stick travels well I take it with us on vacation so we can watch tv. I love that alexa works with this however the program will sometimes search on fire tv and not Hulu or Philo.,5,1,2019-11-9,1,1,0
"Our flatscreen smart TV is now an ""older"" model and some of the apps we used with it are no longer supported. The Fire Stick was an affordable alternative to replacing the TV, which is still working fine and has a good picture. We can now stream Prime Video and YouTube videos through the Fire Stick device. There are lots of other apps available with content we haven't yet explored. The Fire Stick was very easy to set up, and the HD picture provided is of very high quality. I've used the voice recognition feature to somewhat mixed results and the search and navigation functions are not as intuitive as they might be. But overall we are very satisfied with the product and relieved that it helps us to continue to use our ""older"" TV with such a good picture and great options.",4,1,2019-9-27,1,1,0
"I originally got the Fire TV cube to replace my aging first gen Fire TV box because I liked the idea that it could control the dvr box, tv inputs and sound bar. However, I have an echo dot in the other room and it usually responded instead of the cube when I asked turn on the tv, etc. It got real old real fast and I returned the cube.  Well lo and behold, the Fire TV Stick 4K can also control the same devices with the same functionality, with the added benefit that you press the mic button on the remote so it knows you want to speak to it instead of any other Echo devices that are lurking and listening nearby. Plus the speed and WiFi connection are great improvements over my first gen and the remote has buttons that automatically programmed themselves to turn the tv on and off and change the sound bar volume in case you don’t feel like asking Alexa to do it. I’m really loving the Fire TV Stick 4K a lot more than I expected.",5,1,2019-6-1,1,1,0
"I have been using the the 1st Fire TV with 4k for 3 or 4 years now. Actually 2 of them. This is the square black box about the size of one and a half decks of cards. I read hundreds of reviews for this stick 4k and did not see direct comparisons between the units. So here is what I found.With Amazon points and a sale got this cheap enough to give it a try and see for myself if there was a difference. Hell yes there is a difference! For one, I have several videos on my media center PC. With the old FIreTV I can play the videos using Kodi but fast forward or reverse would bog the unit down and occasionally crash it requiring a restart. With the new it all works as you would expect.",5,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0

"If you are not tech savvy , do not buy this. It’s my fault  I’m giving it one star in everything. First of all my grandson said “Grammy that is not a roku, it’s a fire stick”. I guess that was the first problem. #2 Don’t call “Alexa Suri and don’t call Suri Alexa. #3 You will be able to connect it up, I think. #4. You  should be able to turn it on , good luck with that. #5 You will then spend at least an hour loading every app....oh yah you have to have a computer near by to load them. #6 I bought this little diddy, to watch tv Spectrum on my new  “smart TV “ ( let us not go there on that adventure ) so I got  this to download a spectrum app .... guess what both my smart TV and my Fire Stick will do not have spectrum app, nor can you ever get it. #7 How can humans think up a system that is so complicated , and say it is simple. I dream of the old days...you bought TV, came home , plugged it in. Connected a flat antenna wire to the back. You got three stations, cbs,nbc, and abc.  Programming  was very good back then, you liked one of the three. If the picture was “snowy “ you went to the attic and turned the antenna.

"I got my fire sticks today. So far (it's been all of 15 minutes) the remote figured out my soundbar and TV, took all of three minutes. The Stick had to update, started watching a program, then the remote needed an update :cautious:. Hopefully this doesn't become a habit because the update pops up in the middle of the screen.I don't have a 4k tv, but the remote is very responsive and the Stick seems to work better with the extender. It says it in the instructions if you need better wifi to use the extender. So of course I tried it without and it was buffering like crazy (watching the Duke game), no stuttering now with the extender on it.",5,1,2018-11-20,1,1,0
"First of all, I absolutely love my FireTV Stick. The picture quality is amazing on my 4k TV and all the apps work better than on my Samsung TV. But when I want to use Alexa, I get rather irritated, because I am pushing a button on the remote to talk to her, so why shouldn't I just push the other button and change the channel on the remote? If integrating Alexa with FireTV is so great, why can't I control the FireTV on my other Alexa devices? Then, I would not need to push a button on my remote. Changing channels is a nightmare with Alexa. She is so slow, that the cable box has time to change to the first couple numbers she enters before she finishes entering the whole number. I was trying to get to channel 233 and 212... it took me each time to channel 2 on my DirecTV box. The setup process is easy, but it would be great if there was a multiple profile setup, so when I am in my Illinois home, it knows what network and that I am using DirecTV and when I am in Florida, it remembers that I have Spectrum and that the wifi has a different name and password. Traveling with the FireTV Stick is not as cool as I thought it would be, since I have to get it logged into the network to use it, and many hotel networks require a bunch of hoops to jump through to get connected.So if you are not a traveler, and you use a cable company with a slower responding box, you will absolutely love the FireTV stick. I am going to have to figure out a better solution for my DirecTV, since it doesn't wait very long for channel input. I will probably keep the FireTV Stick for my Florida trips instead.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

Fire-tv-stick 4K quickly recognized the Q35 after putting the Q35 into pair mode.I have an old TV. Upon activating the bluetooth on my Q35, TV speaker volume is removed and all sound is directed to the headset. There should be a workaround to have both the headset and TV volume working at the same time. Unfortunately, being brand new I have not figured it out.

"There is not near enough storage in the stick to take advantage of all it offers. I downloaded Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, CBS All Access and one other app and have almost filled my storage. I had a firestick, from 2018. It kept telling me storage almost full and to uninstall some apps. I contacted Amazon support. Old stick said 5.28G available. The representative told me new ones have 8G would give me alot more storage, so I ordered a new one. After got new one I noticed that it said 5.28G just like my old one. I contacted Amazon support. All sticks are 8G but after the preloaded apps put on only 5.28G available for customers to add apps. Want to say Amazon gave me a huge refund on this new stick because of the mis information. But there still isnt enough storage. Can install and uninstall apps as needed but they told me each time that is done residue is left in storage. Eventually have to put stick back to factory settings to clear storage and reinstall and sign back into subscription apps etc.Also I have trouble (with both sticks) with audio cutting out. When that happens I have to back out of app. Turn off. Then on and go back to resume watching. Amazon support remotely went into stick did something. Helped for awhile but wasnt a permament fix.

I can't figure out why it's unable to simply do all that automatically, as it's not a new account.And I don't like that just pausing it for just 5 minutes, takes it back to the menu, and not the show. And today, it took me somewhere else completely, and when I tried to pick it up where I left off, it began playing an episode from a past season!  Huh?  So I then had to hunt through the current season, as I wasn't keeping track of the exact episode number, before I paused it.  More wasted time...

"When service for my older Roku ended a couple months ago, I had no idea which way to go with a new streaming device.  I went into my typical research mode and was still undecided, but a couple perks suddenly made it easy to choose the 4K Firestick.  As a Prime member, I love the convenient integration of all the subscription premium channels that Amazon offers, as well as being able to choose the standalone apps that were on Roku.  Even though I don't yet (or may never) have a 4K TV because no one is currently broadcasting in 4K so why bother, it seemed a no-brainer to get the most updated version and streaming quality of picture afforded by the 4K stick, so the choice was easy and I've not regretted it.However, the stick comes with VERY MINIMAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.  I'm one of those users who likes to familiarize myself thoroughly with a device and its capabilities before installation, and the 3 steps in the enclosed installation manual left me more than puzzled about customizing the settings.  So, I did what I encourage all of you to do -- call $K tech support and have them walk you through ALL THE STEPS. You'll be glad you did. Some things (that I didn't want) were turned on as defaults on the stick, and frankly, it wasn't clear what certain settings even meant or what would be optimal for me.  Even going through the entire setup process onscreen doesn't explain many of the choices that can be tweaked.  For instance:",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I ordered three of these FireTV Stick 4K devices and they work great.  The remote replaces your TV remote you can turn the TV on/off and control volume at the same time.  Now that the YouTube TV spat is over, these are a great addition to your home.  The only problem I have is that one of them OCCASIONALLY drops to a slow speed so that I get SD quality video, frozen video or even drops a connection (while watching TV on an app or even just downloading an app).  I have 1G fiber and so speed should never be a problem.  My iPhone show over 300Mbs at this location.  I tried to have it replaced but Amazon now requires you to go through a chat instead of just clicking a return.  That means doing all of the things most folks try first (unplug, reset to factory, try other access point or modem, swap out other FireTV unit).  In the end, a promised email to tell me how to return never came (checked SPAM) so you can't return a defective one, but at the $25 Christmas price it is not a big loss. UPDATE.  Apparently some other issues.

"I don't usually write reviews, but I am very impressed with the quality of this product. I used to stream my streaming services on my Blu-ray DVD player connected by HDMI to my Vision TV. I know that was a bit antiquated, but it worked okay for me. That is until, I could no longer access my premium ad ons on my Hulu subscription. I saw that this was on sale during the Amazon July 15th and 16th events, so I jumped on the chance to take advantage.Best $25.00 I ever spent! This fire stick has elevated my viewing experience to a truly enjoyable viewing experience. Now, I can access all of my streaming services (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu and Starz) all on one platform and at a much better quality. Also, my Hulu premium add ons are available through my firestick. The initial set up was intuitive and the steps were easy to follow. Integration was seamless and now I only need one control to turn on my TV and manage my subscriptions. If you are thinking of buying this item, do it! It will improve your viewing experience.

"My other option was purchasing the Roku streaming stick+ (4k). I decided to go with the firestick because of the different apps it can run and the customization I can do on it. I like using Alexa to find movies, tv shows, and apps as well as controlling the media I'm watching (rewind, fast forward, pause) and asking questions. The remote has a power button and volume control buttons that can control my TV (I have a curved 4k Samsung TV) so that I don't have to keep switching remotes.  The remote that my TV uses is actually universal but it does not allow me to use Alexa so I can push it off to the side. It is very simple to use and will work on any TV that has an HDMI port. I like how portable it is because I can take it with me when I travel.  The Dolby Atmos sound system sounds great and the picture quality is amazing. Customer service is available 24/7 over the phone or through chat. I received a replacement device the very next day after the one I originally ordered wasn't able to install apps after downloading. The fire stick does put amazon products and media front and center, but it isn't a big deal to me.

After I ordered it I saw the standard fire stick but the price difference was only $10 so I didn't bother changing the order.  Bottom line is that it works great with my older Vizio TVs, paired the remote with one TV and it also works with the other.  The real reason I bought it was to use on a projector, I was a little concerned that I saw somewhere on the listing that Amazon indicated it wouldn't work with a projector.  They might have meant that the remote won't work as a remote for the projector itself but it works as expected with the Fire Stick.  In the past I rarely watched Amazon video content but with the Fire Stick I have been using it often paired with a projector and an ancient Panasonic surround sound system that I haven't used in years - great theater experience.

BUT you can say “Alexa go home on fire tv” and Alexa will turn on your TV, change the input to fire tv, and voila.Basically it’s theorized by some commenters that amazon wants you to buy the more expensive options, so they disabled the ability to control your fire tv with products other than the remote (since the functionality is clearly there when using “go home...”)",3,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I am talking to  people that are using this to interface with either a video projector or a receiver.  This product is so well designed with interface options matching any imaginable requirement. First, to connect it to a video source to get the 4K capability that source must have 4K compatibility, the receiver must have that or it won’t provide a recognizable signal.  An obvious requirement but the negative reviews are a result of that missing standard.  The package includes the stick which must be powered, and must importantly, an extension that allows you to plug the extender into your receiver and then the 4K stick in to the extension. So you have only a small HDMI plug to deal with.  I mention this as with many installations into a receiver you have multiple HDMI sources and space at the receiver is “tight”, the extender provides only a minimal amount of space requirement.  In my installation, I offer this to show the projector folks the flexibility that this design offers, I have a PS4, DVD player, home Direct TV, and now the Fire Stick all in place at the same time.  The 4K works perfectly, but you do have to have the necessary bandwidth.  Installation was flawless, with the software update taking about 15 minutes.

Now I only wish I had done so sooner.The remote alone is worth the entire price!  No longer do I need to use a separate remote for TV on/off and volume.

"I recently cut the cable tv, well, to be honest, I'm still in the process. I'm not sure how useful a firestick would be without subscribing to a ton of services. I have sling tv (which has AMC) for $30 a month, Hulu without ads for $11.99, Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime (of course) and a free year of Apple TV (not sure I would pay for that service as the library is limited and they put items on their main menu that you have to purchase separately which is not user-friendly). I opted for sling instead of Hulu live because I needed AMC and I went with Hulu without ads based on the reviews of the cheaper version.  The firestick works great. Minor lag with voice recognition, but I can't use it to search all of the streaming apps. You can't say AMC or HGTV on Sling. It doesn't recognize the command so I'm forced to search through the menus. The remote is small and based on the recommendation of my daughter I purchased a sleeve in a bright color to help it stand out in the house. Also, the one drawback of the entire setup is the inability for me to change inputs from the Fire TV remote. I can turn off the tv and adjust the volume but it does not have the ability to change inputs which really stinks coming from a Comcast voice control remote.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0

I use Verizon mobile hotspot as my internet connection, and there is no lagging. I do not have prime but im considering purchasing prime so that I'll have access to free movies. Right now, I'm renting movies from Amazon and I also have a Netflix subscription. I do notice that when I watch Netflix, it is a bit pixelated at first but it clears up after a couple minutes. and maybe that'll go away completely over time (just received the fire stick yesterday).  I do not have Alexa but the voice commands still work. All you have to do is hold down the microphone and speak commands while holding. For example, ""fast forward 30 seconds"", and it works! The set up process was super simple. The remote automatically connected to my 1080p Hisense (not smart) television so that I am able to adjust the volume and turn the TV on/off using the fire stick remote.

I love the new 4k firestick I don't even have to use my TV remote now some of the benefits of that is that it saves money on batteries a course and on top of that it's a lot easier to use plus I've often thought that the Fire Sticks need it some kind of sound when they first boot it up now they have that and I love it it's a lot more cleaner all around kind of image both on the device and the screen and operation it's a lot nicer and has some interesting new features so far I haven't found a single bad thing about any of the improvements they made to the fire stick this act upon boot up I'm glad I sent it to my TV I was kind of questioning if I should even do that but in the end I'm glad I did because now I can only control the volume but since my TV said to my surround sound I can also control the volume of my surround sound plus Alexa is a lot better as well much more clear audio much more clear picture and much more clear on speech what I mean by that is Alexa can understand me a lot better than the old ones before Alexa had kind of a problem with understanding different accents and drawers so a lot of people we're having problems cluding some of the friends I know talking to Alexa now with the new 4k it's a lot easier I often find myself now telling Alexa to pause my shows if you would have told me 20 years ago that I'd be talkin to my TV I would have called the police and had you admitted to the psychiatric hospital let alone that my TV now talks back to me,5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"Pro: Good picture and if you get a decent network connection it tends to stay up. Comcast is pretty good but for what Fire Stick/Cube offers it is a better deal financially.Con: Fire Stick/Cube doesn't really understand many voice commands and with its minimalist approach to the remote control you don't have alternatives like a Comcast remote. For instance ""Alexa Channel five"" usually results in a panel of random channels none of which is my local channel five (I have both Recast and YouTube TV which have my local PBS which is channel five) If I say ""Alexa Tune to Channel Five"" I generally will get channel five.

"I've gotten very accustomed to Amazon devices & I've got to say, that I really do like them. Just opening the newest Fire TV Stick 4K and the product itself is quite compact; which is great! The Fire TV Stick 4K itself is shorter in length than the remote, which is also not huge, but quite comfortable size unless you're beyond a giant. Set up is super fast from plug in, to ""programming it,"" 10 minutes or less..w/o a doubt!! (Not including login to your existing Netflix, etc accounts.) NOT complicated by ANY means!! It does it all by itself, just follow the on screen prompts & push whatever buttons on the remote & you're all set!! REALLY THAT SIMPLE!! If it's anything like my Fire TV Box, I think I'm going to like it A LOT!!My ONLY question..which I wasn't quite sure about when I was placing the order was..I had originally wondered if the Fire TV Stick 4K would require to be plugged into a wall outlet or not? It might seem like an obvious answer of yes...but the reason I was thinking about this is because sometimes devices like this can SOMETIMES get it's ""power"" from what it's plugged into..& I know that would mean that the HDMI spot on the actual TV would need to be able to ""handle"" that..but I wasn't sure if MAYBE Amazon would've considered this & worked out a perfect solution, so that you wouldn't need to have one more thing to plug in, behind your TV.  .... Sadly they didn't ""handle"" it... let's be clear..the Fire TV Stick 4K does include ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING you'll need, (except for a TV), & it's SUPER EASY to set up.. BUT one less wire would've been FANTASTICALLY PHENOMENAL!! But that's just one small detail, so far! Maybe they'll address it w/next version??",4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
This review is not about the quality of the Firestick 4K but about the lack of customer service for a defective device.I purchased a 4th Firestick last week.  After one day the remote became dead.  I called customer service to obtain a replacement.  The call was transferred to a Firestick specialist in India who agreed that a replacement was required.  But last week the price was $34.99; reordering now is $49.99.  The customer service manager told me to call back to get a refund for the difference in price.,1,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
"Quite enjoying my firestick 4k so far, previously I had bought a new blu-ray player that would allow me to access Netflix, and later Amazon Prime.  The blu-ray player has a set of touch controls on top, and had gotten some sort of bug that it would start cycling through all of the options, play, pause, off, on...  so I decided to get the stick.I'm quite glad that I did, it's so much faster, where before I would have to give it 5-10 seconds to load up something new, or a little less to go to a new episode, now with firestick 4k it loads up almost instantly.  And yes, I'm using the same exact wifi, did not swap out anything except the blu-ray for the firestick.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
I ordered two of these fire sticks at once one of them doesn't give me as much of a problem as the other matter of fact it gives me like 90% less of a problem but Amazon corrected it and granted to replace the fire stick that I struggled with the last two or three months my Morty had just expired like 2 weeks before that because they only offered 90 day warranty on it that I did not read a knock was aware of I had assumed that it was a one-year replacement warranty so it is only a 90-day warranty if you're not satisfied with that you need to contact them as soon as possible if I struggled with it kept having to reset it kept having to unplug it it would freeze up Alexa wouldn't work more than half the time and my remote won't unpair I can never get it to pair back and then when I could it still wouldn't work properly with volume or power the other fire stick is great I'm not saying that the fire sticks are a bad thing I just probably happened to get a lemon I just appreciate the fact that Amazon takes the time to treat their customers with respect and fix incorrect things accordingly if you ever have any trouble with stuff you purchase a highly recommend to contact Amazon customer service by phone or through chat not in the app that only gives you certain options and a lot of us need to express ourselves and what the problem is not just hit return print out a label and send it back,4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I replaced an OEM adapter with this FireTV one and never looked back. This thing is wonderful. It didn't take long to learn its interfaces to everything and with Prime it supplied almost everything I desired. However, recently I looked into Showtime directly from Amazon Prime which was significantly less than my DISH subscription. I ordered it and canceled DISH and gained $9/month (first 3 months) and $4/month (after that). I did find out though that Prime only got me to East and West Showtime and did not get me to Showtime Beyond and it's other Showtime channels. But, signing up for Prime Showtime DID give me Showtime Anytime ID which allows me to get to all the channels via my Kindle or PC. My PC has Miracast and Prime Video work like a dream with it. So, anything I can do on PC I can now display on FireTV. For those who don't know it, if you HOLD the Home button on your remote you will get some ICONs displayed. One of these is MIRRORING which you select when you want to cast your PC screen to the FireTV. Good articles on Internet for setting up Miracast, chaeking your PC to see if it has the capability, and using it. Love the FireTV.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"The Fire Stick works well with my tv. It’s a basic plug & play. However, I haven’t yet utilized its capabilities in conjunction with Alexa & voice activation. Nonetheless, it’s a great accessory for those who just have basic cable. The rental fees are reasonable, but also there are additional apps for some free viewing. As I’ve said prior, it has more options available; that I haven’t unveiled yet.Great accessory, good price & offers more options with basic cable hook ups. We’re very happy with it. A good purchase. It’s also a good idea, to see if your tv has the proper input plug. I have an 11 year old Sony 40” HD & it works well with it.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
Update: got a call from amazon telling me he was looking at my fire stick and it had an update that needed to happen. Despite it saying it checked for updates two days ago and there were none and we have been having this problem for awhile. It’s been checking updates for over twenty minutes and nothing is showing. I’m now worried my account has been compromised as he did have info on my account and from my account but his info on my fire stick was far from correct. Beware suspicious calls from “amazon”.Picture attached is an amazon prime show LOL: Australia. It keeps going pixelated and only stops if I exit out of the show and then open it again. This is the second ring in the latest fire stick ... circus...,2,1,2020-7-13,1,0,1
"There were two reasons we made the jump to Fire TV, cutting the expensive ""cable"" to satellite or cable tv and the voice command feature.I'll start with the voice command feature first.  We have a blind individual in our household.  We needed something simple to use that would get her to content without having a tremendous number of remotes or devices.  The firestick fit the bill.  It allows her to tune to live tv just by asking Alexa, but she can also access Sirius XM using the same remote.  Alexa has excellent voice recognition which makes life much simpler for her.  Works beautifully.  The remote having just basic functions allows her to easily control volume and power as well - if she doesn't use Alexa directly.",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"Have been using this for months now, and have become very frustrated with it.  Yes, you can download plenty of apps to watch free stuff, but they don't work well.  The stick will drop the program you're watching over and over again.  And once dropped, you have to start from the home page and go all the way back to the app and show you were watching, and sometimes, it doesn't even start where you left off.  This same thing happens if you pause a show you are watching.  You would expect to be able to just push play and start from where you paused it, but no, you get to go back home and start all over.  In addition, several apps don't work with the remote.  For example, hit pause on the RedBull App, and you'll find yourself watching a different show.  Fast forward and reverse have the same results.  Last, but not least, many of the shows play at a low volume, so you have to really crank the speaker volume... until the commercials run; then you're scrambling for the remote to mute so that you don't piss off the neighbors will the loud yelling.  In the end, I do not recommend this streaming option, as Roku and others do a much better job.  Hope this helps save someone the headache this has given us!Had to add to this review, since I can no longer stand the stupid remote.  There is no backlight, and the buttons are too small, the same size, and right next to each other.  You will find yourself constantly hitting the wrong button, like hitting Home instead of Pause (they are stacked together), and then you'll find yourself all the way back at the home page and you'll have to navigate back to whatever you were watching.  Who thought this was a good idea.  They should be fired.  With all that space on the remote, you would think they could make bigger buttons of different shapes, and leave plenty of space between them.  What a joke!!!",2,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"Fire TV Stick 4K does all the bells and whistles that you want it to, while supporting bigger video and HDR. The big difference between this and its predecessors is that it doesn't have a button attached to the device, so you risk suffering technical difficulties without DIY troubleshooting or at least without an appropriate cable or device to help with it. It still carries good power and performance for getting my streaming services and little games that I like playing here and there.Apart from that, it still impresses with Alexa on the side. Now if only its remote can recognize my words better...",4,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"Much faster than my older 2nd generation 1024 stick. Easy to set up. The new remote control is nice. The new volume, power, and mute buttons are very useful. Streaming quality is very good. Interface integrates nicely with Amazon's Recast DVR. No problems at all.I am not happy that Disney+ is not expected to be supported. That would mean that I have to reconnect my old Roku streamer.

"Update 8/26/2020After getting a low memory warning repeatedly I factory reset the device. Doing so cleaned up and made 4 GB available. I only installed 5 applications that use less than 500MB. After isntall, it showed about 3.5 GB available. 2 weeks later, it shows 1 GB available. Looking at data and cache use by the 5 apps, combined they do not add up to the missing 2 GB. Something in these Fire TV sticks eats your memory and there is no way to clear it without a full factory reset (which means installing and logging into all the apps all over - something that is fine doing once, but not something you want to be doing quarterly). I'm lowering my score to 1 because this is unacceptable in such a widely used product and it renders it worthless.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0

I won't bore you with the number of steps it took me just to get to Prime, or the problems I had once there, so I'll just say that I bought the stick as an easier way to get there until I upgrade my TV. Since I don't have a 4K TV or Dolby Atmos yet, I can't speak to how well that works. However, I got this stick for the day when I do have both those things.Pros:",4,1,2018-12-19,1,1,0
"I own an iPhone, but still chose the Firestick over the Apple TV here’s why!This has been one of the most pleasant experiences and purchases I have made from Amazon. I’ve had a home theater setup for a while, but never purchased a universal remote for simplicity. Let me tell you I absolutely LOVE (caps lock for emphasis) the remote on this thing! Voice controls and changing inputs with voice (so much faster than flipping through inputs manually)  being able to control and connect my receiver to the remote painlessly and ridiculously fast. I got this whole thing setup and going in 15minutes and I’m still raving about it to friends and family. I love the entertainment hub system and my absolute favorite thing about it is NO LAG!

"I have a great PLEX setup on my NVIDIA Shield TV.  It was easy to setup and has lots of features.  I wanted add another PLEX client in my wife's workout room, so I went with the Fire TV Stick 4K. The included apps like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc all seemed to work well in my tests.  The PLEX client was terrible. The performance was slow, and many of the movies and TV shows would flash/flicker between the video and a green screen.  After an online search, it looks like this is a common problem. I wasted hours trying suggested solutions, but it was not fixed.  I am returning the Fire stick.  Either the this hardware is not good enough to run PLEX well, or this platform is not well supported by the software.  It's not worth my time to try to fix it.  I expect a better user experience.",3,1,2019-6-3,1,1,0
"Okay I love my Firestick. There was almost nothing to the setup. I've had to reboot about 3 times since I got it but it really is a great option. HOWEVER I believe that Amazon must be using this remote control to test some sort of proprietary cloaking technology.  Because this remote can apparently blend in with anything. I can be looking right at it and still not see it. Maybe it's the curves, the small size, or it's using a black that is in a special color spectrum but I lose this dang thing on a daily basis!!!! Right now it's been lost for 3 days. And it's in a 1 room apartment!!!! I literally moved all furniture looking to see if it fell under anything but nope I think that it is gone forever. Thank the gods there is an iphone app although it's a little slow and clunkity. Either that or I pissed off my house elf.  So my only advice to Amazon (and reason for only 4 stars) is that it needs to have a ""find my remote"" beeper feature and it should come in multiple bright neon colors. Because it looks like I'm going to shell out $30 for a new one which makes me very unhappy. When I get it I'm disabling the cloaking feature by painting it a bright shiny glow in the dark pink!!

"I own both the FireStick and the FireTV Stick 4k. Got them both last year in 2019. I use them frequently. I am in a 2 week trial of YouTube TV as I am moving away from satellite. The FireStick only receives live tv up to 720p, the 4k stick receives live tv @ 1080p.  I also receive much higher bandwidth with the 4k, in fact sometimes with the FireStick it defaults down to 480 or 360.  Even with the fire stick in the TV closest to the modem/router ( about 4 foot away) the Fire Stick still only receives in 720p.  I recently found this out because the app, YouTubeTv, has a selection where you see what resolution you are getting.  I have DSL and at best where I live I can get up to 12,000. So I cannot get 4k.  On my 65 inch LG OLED TV Amazon Prime app I can get sometimes high rez and HDR, but usually it defaults to HD ( 1080 ) and/or HDR. My other TV's are older LG 55 inch 3d 240 3d TVs.  They are 1080p max.  However when I stream in archived files from Netfix or Amazon Prime, or on demand shows off of YouTubeTv, like The Late Show, Colbert (CBS) it moves up to 1080.  For live streams, even if you have a 1080 HD set, GO with the FIreStick TV 4 K, its got 2 gigs of RAM and 8 gigs of storage and a super quadcore processor, and, the picture and sound quality are great.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"Very poor processing power in this Fire TV Stick.  It stutters on live TV performance.  This means tickers aren't smooth but jump around (skip frames/judder).  Live sports skip frames which are deal breakers for even the least of picky.  It happens about every 3-5 seconds.  I thought I had a defective unit which my daughter bought last November for me.  I used it very sparingly as I had an Nvidia Shield TV and that streamer is buttery smooth for live sports on TV.  I decided to visit some forums and read up and it seemed like my problem was certainly not the norm for this device.  Well the reconditioned unit came in that replaced the original and although it's marginally better, it still has judder.  Enough to scrap it and never use it.  I know what I'm doing on video settings too.  I'm an audio and video junkie.  I've tried 4k rez with auto refresh, 1080p/60, 1080p/50 and all have the exact same amount of judder.  I've hooked the FTV up directly to my LG C9 OLED and then to my Anthem AVM60 Processor back to the LG - same amount of judder either way.  So, over the weekend I decided to dust off my Fire TV Pendant 4k and give it a try (AT&T TV Now App).  Guess what?  Buttery smooth motion effects and banners.  Like, zero judder.  I'm even using the same power block, USB cable and ethernet cable as I was using on the regular FTV 4k.

"Bought a pair of these FireStick 4K's to try with my PLEX server. I have been using Roku boxes for the past couple of years and have been happy with them. to my surprise the FireStick 4K worked great, it was easy enough to setup and streaming quality was great. the interfaces are different between the 2 devices, but after you use it some, there is no problems. i like how the FireStick 4K has the options to adjust the sound and picture, not just for an app like PLEX, but for the device in general also. you can increase the dialog/speech louder or level the volume. has the options to do HDR, and screen scaling if the image goes off the screen some.Need to pick between the Roku 4K stick and FireStick 4K? in my opinion, they are pretty equal from what i have seen so far. streaming quality is great on both. screen saver on the Roku is a clock, which i love, and on the FireStick they use pictures. that is still cool if you have pictures on your Amazon account and want a slide show on your TV as a screen saver. Both units have mostly the same apps. looks like the FireStick 4K has a few new ones i did not see on Roku. mainly options for local channels, but it was only 1 or 2, not all in my area.

So it was a little bit of a learning curve being a strict ROKU owner. Last a Christmas I received smart switches and other smart devices to turn my home into a smart home. That’s when I decided to take the plunge and see what the firestick was all about. Well lemme tell you! Having Alexa and the firestick is highly convenient and the streaming is amazing. I actually like it better than the Roku. Now I did buy the Ethernet adapter so there was no buffering. Yes Amazon does throw their shows and stuff in your face on the front page but other than that no complaints. It took a little while for ALL the voice commands to work but now that it does.

"Having previously used an earlier version of the Fire Stick, we purchased the newer Fire TV Stick 4k to use with a new tv screen. I am definitely not a skilled tech type person - just an average user. And we were able to install the new 4k stick and log on easily as Amazon Prime users. The only change we made was to add a PIN because of visiting grandkids.What is driving us crazy is that even after logging on, the interface cannot keep track of our recent videos, wants to charge us fees for programming that is free for Prime members every other time we try to use the service. Logging out and back in doesn't help. We have an awful time searching through menus hoping to find a better way to return watching a series (i.e. Justify, Season 1) for ""free"" as part of our Amazon Prime membership. We finally gave up and moved on to Season 2 -  so far, so good.

"I purchased this unit due to the remote, which now sports a mute button , volume and power buttons, making it an attractive competitor for the Roku Ultra that I already have.  It's fine, but I don't expect to be ditching my Roku anytime soon.  I do like the ability of the Firestick to power both the receiver and the TV at the same time, but I've found that the two are frequently out of sync - it keeps turning one on but not the other, and I have to go dig out the receiver remote anyway to set things right.  Never had this problem with the Roku remote  And WHY oh WHY Amazon did you not incorporate the ability to beep the remote when it gets lost?  This is one of the major reasons I'm primarily sticking with the Roku system.  Otherwise the Firestick remote would have been fantastic.  I'm also having ridiculously bad audio lag with Sling on the Firestick - about 1-2 seconds of lag on anything I try to watch.  Strangely, the lag is not present within any of the other apps that I've tried (Amazon content, Hulu, Netflix).  I do find that the Amazon content on the Firestick is lightning fast - way faster than Roku's Amazon app and i think even faster than my older Fire TV unit.  I'd keep this for the Amazon content as it is quite nice, but out of general convenience and lack of issues, I'm sticking with the Roku for just about everything else.",3,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0

"I bought 4 Fire Sticks 4K for my kitchen, Living room, bedroom & office. I was wanting to cut down on cable. Installing them was easy. Lots of putting in info so be patient. The picture was always clear on all TVs. Sound quality was always good. We had the best of HuLu package where you would get the local channels and lots of other cable channels + whatever else HuLu had to offer and whatever the Fire Stick has to offer. It cost us about $55/mo. It was better than paying $170/MO. My issue was wi-fi/streaming connection. I have good router/wifi connection. Heck, you can get wifi all the way outside to the furthest part of my yard! 👍🏼Many times the I’d be watching a program and the Fire Stick would shut off and return to the Home screen. I’d reboot it. The same thing would happen. I called HuLu. I did what they told me to do, which was what I already did and it did the same damn thing. Our family tried it for a month and we couldn’t wait to go back to cable. I had to call HuLu about 3-4 times regard issues. The other issue was that if you wanted to watch anything up to date or new you had to buy it through Netflix or since we already had HuLu you would have to get Showtime or HBO or Cinemax if that particular movie was being shown through that premium network. Well hell, by the time you get Netflix, a Showtime or any other premium network, you’ll be back up to paying about $120.00 or more! I was so frustrated and truly pissed. So, I was able to go back to cable under a 1yr. contract at a cheaper price and add on. When all was said and done I was paying about $130 and no hassles.

Not the case.  Technician was helpful in getting the stick re registered in my name, so all 3 devices are registered to me, and I'm still get the benefits of Amazon Prime through my wife.A small negative that I have to work around; the power cord for the stick is too short to go through the wall behind the TV down to an outlet, and the USB ports on my 2017 Sony KD-55XT20E are only .5 amps, so there's not enough power to support the stick through the USB port without the power cord going down to the outlet showing.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,7,0

I have my stick connected to a soundbar.  This soundbar actually shows up in my Alexa devices.  It even shows as an option for multi room music.  If I call on Alexa to play music through the fire tv by name it will not do it.  If I add the fire tv to a “multi room music group” it works great.  The only problem is that the multi room music group requires two devices at a minimum. So I add a second device but then of course it plays on the other device simultaneously.

"While the stick is reasonably fast and streams very well, the interface/menu leaves a LOT to be desired.  For example, I cannot get to a standard grid view of my Amazon saved programs.  It has a single line of programs that you have to scroll right through to find programs you have added to your watchlist.  Every other system (Dish, Roku, blu ray players, etc.) have a My List selection that brings up a grid for easy access.  Amazingly, the Fire TV Stick does not.I also have not been able to find a selection to view ONLY titles available with Prime (something that is extremely easy to do with the PC interface).  You apparently can use the voice feature to search for Prime only titles but for someone used to menu selections, it isn't there.",3,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"I've been a long time fire TV user/fan. I will still use my older fire TV devices, but this one is being returned. So 3 Stars for a great streaming device, minus 2 Stars for a remote that needs very specific AV equipment/setup/brands in order to work as expected.Problems I'm having: first it's crucial to understand that this remote will only control the volume for a preselected set of sound devices (TVs, soundboard, receivers). I'm sure there is a list somewhere, but I haven't found it. Also the volume will only work with line-of -sight devices. For me these two oversights on my part made for a not so plug and play experience. On my downstairs TV the ""sound bar"" I use is not supported so no worky work there. My upstairs TV has a nice built in AV cabinet, with the receiver behind a clean wood door.  Again 2nd attempt is a solid no go. Mind you I only discovered this by asking the polite customer service reps specific detailed questions. Without my intervening I would have likely spent another 45 minutes troubleshooting an impossible to fix scenario.",3,1,2018-11-6,1,0,0
"I only ordered this because there was an offer I saw and thought that this would be a great enhancement to my aging Samsung Smart TV that is getting to be very slow on the apps to move around due to all the constant updates that are pushed to my TV.  Since getting the Fire TV Stick, I use the same APPS I used to use, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube etc but with this FireTV Stick 4K version, everything is supper fast the way it should be.  This is much faster than my Samsung Apps were when my TV was brand new.  I never use the Samsung Smart Part of the TV, now all I use is the Fire TV Stick 4K version even though I do not have a 4K TV.  I would only buy the Fire TV 4K version as it has a faster CPU inside and overall speed is faster.  Since my purchase, I have subscribed to Prime so there you have it.  Oh and I bought a 2nd one for my other TV.If you travel, take it with you and you have access to all your apps and shows wherever you go as long as you have an HDMI input in the TV and WiFi.",4,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0

I originally brought this to stream... Baby Shark but now we use it for so much more. We usually streamed through the PS4 but it became annoying when my toddler would get ahold of the controller and even more annoying when the controller would get bumped and skipped videos.We seriously love the fire stick.

"Originally had the older Firestick on 1 TV. Streaming not so great but we decided to get rid of 2 out of 3 cable boxes anyway, plus buy a 4k stick for the other TV without a box. The 4k stick worked well. The old stick, not so well. Meanwhile, the new stick kept trying to connect to 2.4 g with me then going into the network option to switch it over to 5 g. (The Firestick was telling me it didn't like the 2.4.). And the TV with the old stick was also having major problems. Evidentally, the sticks like to grab onto whatever g being transmitted, good or otherwise. So, in my home system of 1 router with 2 repeaters, I made the repeaters only transmit 5 g. Still not good. The router was ""deciding"" itself what g it should send to the repeaters anyway. So I switched the repeaters back to both bands. Then changed the router, now splitting the 5 and 2.4, taking choice away from the router. I could then solidly pick the 5 g band for the sticks. So far, so good. Excellent streaming now on the 4k stick TV. Better, but still not so good on the TV with the old stick. Now going to buy the more powerful 4k stick for that one.",4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I do really like the Fire Stick and I love some aspects of the remote such as being able to turn the TV on and off, and being able to control my sound bar. The only thing I don't like is that there is no longer a direct connection between the remote and the Fire TV itself. For example, you can no longer have the remote underneath your blanket and still be able to control the Fire TV. It has to have direct line of sight to control the Fire. I understand why they did this, to give you the ability to control your TV and Sound bar setups. I just hate having to lift the remote up, and point it at my TV, it's just annoying and unnecessary considering the older models have this technology. It's part of the reason I have always preferred Fire TV to the Roku.But me personally I'd pay an additional $20 to have this direct wireless connection like every other Fire TV I've had, and also the support for the TV and sound bar. I haven't seen any other complaints about this which surprises me, maybe I'm just a little harder to please. I have to say though I was a little disappointed in the remote. I think an easy fix would be to have it so only the volume controls and power controls be the normal remote style and then change every other control to go directly wireless like the old remotes.",3,1,2018-12-17,1,1,0

Ok so when I got this the instructions say point at TV and it should pop right up. I am going to save you all the two day research I had to do to get this thing working. First whatever HDMI port you put the stick in see what number it is on your TV. Most TV's have about 4 ports and they are numbered. Then turn on your TV and make sure you have it on the correct HDMI number. Mine was in number 4.  Once I did that Firestick TV will pop up on your screen. Point the remote at the TV and hold the Home button (the one that looks like a house) down for a few seconds until the orange light starts flashing. Then it will say something remote synced.  Then you will get prompts that will ask for your email associated with Amazon and your password so have those ready. Also have ready your password for your internet and know your internet name. You can go on You Tube for the rest of the set up details. The part I already told you is not on the You Tube videos epecially the part about the HDMI  setting. After I got it set up it works like a champ. So so much cheaper than paying $211 a month for cable TV.,4,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"One of the small wonders in the world.  Everything works great to turn an old tv into a smart tv.  You can access all of your third party applications such as Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.  I appreciate the addition of other free third party applications which give you just another layer to access additional tv shows and movies for you viewing pleasure.  Tubi, Crackle, and IMDbtv just to name a few.  Oh and don’t forget about the ability to control your home automation with the voice controls.  This unit is a real powerhouse of fun and ease of use.  I love the Firestick in 4K and even bought one for my kids room to watch YouTube Kids videos.  I almost forgot that you can also listen to common music apps such as Amazon Music, Apple iTunes can be accessed, Pandora, and Yahoo music are available in addition to several other apps for various purposes.  I can’t believe how much they packed into this tiny unit.  This is certainly one of the more clever devices as I feel that ever room could use one.  I’d say the only thing that is frustrating is that the remote turns on multiple tv’s when they are the same brand and within reach.  I have two tv’s mounted to one of my kid’s bedrooms.  They are different age groups and like to do different things.  Turning on the tv for one may turn the tv off for the other.

"I thought this would be better than the original but except for some streaming improvements it was pretty much the same.  As with the old, the cords to the unit are too short.  Especially the HDMI cord.  Even in the guide it tells you not to have the unit too close to your TV, yet the cord itself is hardly long enough to get beyond the television.  The product really should be useable right out of the box and not require you to go buy more accessories to make it work more efficiently.  Additionally, like the previous version, I'm forever having to restart it to receive the wi-fi signal.  The router is not that far away...maybe 25 feet.

Only thing is the volume control does not work on my tv so I still have the use the tv remote to control the volume but other than that I love it.

"I love my fire-stick.  My husband doesn't.  What it boils down to is habits and what you find worth your time. Everyone has habits whether they realize it or not. I am not one to channel surf, my husband is a channel surfer.  At any given time he is watching multiple sports games.  He is used to being able to hit the recall button, not to mention, he knew the channel numbers and had a channel guide that would go days ahead.  This comes with having satellite for 20 years!!  I found that his familiarity and comfort was not worth the 165.00 a month (that continually raised every year).  With the fire-stick, I watch the same things I did, he watches the same things he did and we are doing it at a third of the price.  It is very easy to use.  You just have to adjust because it is not the same set-up as a satellite/cable company. Installation was easy.  One of our local stations struggles to run in the mornings, but it is the station not the fire-stick.  That station didn't run on satellite flawlessly either.  Again I love my fire-stick and will continue to use it.  Very worth getting rid of that satellite bill.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
I had one of the Roku devices that utilizes a remote that interacts via WiFi link rather than dedicated RF or IR signal and that can become intermittent at best. The Amazon device uses RF/IR remote that is much more stable and reliable. The interface is nice but don't get me started on the insane costs for watching Amazon episodic programs. Tease you with one free show and charge for every other following one unlike HULU or Netflix. But I digress as the stick device does an excellent job with intuitive interactive setup that's easy. Highly recommend its performance as well. Am also going to test the Fire Cube next as a comparison.,5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0
"So in my bedroom I have a smart tv but I don’t have a cable box. I can only stream Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime, YouTube, etc. I have a Vizio tv and I should be able to access all this streaming content because it’s a smart tv but the apps were always crashing and so slow. I would check the WiFi and it was fine. I could stream it on my phone just fine and even cast it onto my tv fine so it wasn’t the WiFi. I concluded my actual smart tv was just subpar. I decided to get the firestick and see what would happen and it works amazing! No more crashing! I can fast forward and rewind all I want without the app crashing and having to reboot the tv! I should have gotten this firestick a while ago!!",5,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"This is awesome. It replaced my xbox (or as I call it, my $200 Netflix machine) and it is worth it. The overhauled hardware makes this lightening fast, and the quality it beautiful! The remote is simplistic and the setup is easy. This remote does have the IR sensor so you can adjust your tvs volume. I also have this linked to 2 dots, 4 smart plugs, and a wyze cam. You can control all of those with the voice command in the remote. You can also control the tv from your dot. It's also convenient to for vacations as you can plug this into hotel tvs. My only gripe is that there's a lot of menus to go through to force stop an app if it freezes. (Which has happened 3 times for Hulu over 100's of hours of playing video) If you want something easy to use at a good price with the potential to make your house a smart home, this is a good accessory. It does have access to YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, Pandora, and a TON of other apps. At some point, I'll pick another one up for other rooms in my house.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,1,0

For price can make a non smart TV and technically you can sideload Android apps if you know what you're doing. Excellent for IPTV and other streaming services.

"I just do not get this. I know how to use it and understand the functions, but why? Smart TV and voice activated remotes have been around for years and they don't have the burden of being also integrated with Alexa, which is a mess of an ""assistant.""My cable company has a free app that I can play on any device, so I bought this firestick because it was on sale cheap enough that I figured that I would set it up on the firestick for the bedroom TV. Doing this would save us by getting around the addition cable box costs. But these sticks only access the most useless and/or redundant apps for TV and not something useful, like the cable company apps. Our cable company doesn't care, because I can load their app on every other device in the house and cast it. But this one device where it would make most sense, Amazon is blocking it.

"I just got this in today, and 5 minutes after plugging it in I’m already way more excited than I was for the previous 2 versions. The first thing you notice is the remote setup. It didn’t just connect to it and that was that, it actually setup the remote to work with my surround sound receiver! One less remote! After setting up remote, setup my apps. No lagging going between apps and selecting, download, back out, reorganize, select app, get out, scroll through, select another, set to download, back out, move apps around.... it all flowed great. All this was done late, so after connecting all my accounts, I was done for the night. Hit the power button on the remote and tv AND receiver turned off! I know universal remotes isn’t a new concept, but hitting 1 button and all devices turning on/off, I’m more excited about not needing any other remotes for this tv again than I am the 4K.As I said, I just got it and all I’ve done is set stuff up, plus there’s still the issue of no Vudu/UV access, so tentatively giving 4-stars.

"Who knew? I received a notification that Prime Video would no longer support my smart Sony TV, which is apparently a few years too old to be smart enough for Prime Video. The only options they offered, short of buying a new TV, were Amazon devices like this Fire TV stick.The stick changed everything--for the better. What I previously thought was just shoddy streaming from Prime Video turned out to be Prime Video phasing out my smart TV. Episode photos wouldn't show, streaming would be interrupted, pausing caused malfunctions. The Fire TV stick made Prime Video more like Netflix. I had no idea that something like the Fire TV stick would improve it that much. The downside, of course, is that Amazon forces viewers to buy additional Amazon products to stream their stuff, which yes, we should resent because Netflix doesn't do that. On the other hand, it has so vastly improved the streaming quality and options on my TV that I'm too thrilled with that to be resentful. I use none of the voice recognition features, however, because I don't want even more privacy breaches than we're all already dealing with. I don't want Alexa either, so I can't comment on the voice qualities, only that the stick has made streaming Prime Video and my MHz subscription via Prime much better.",5,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0
"I hope this review is helpful for some people. Especially if you have not had one before. I think a lot of it depends on your Internet. It obviously runs well if you have high-speed Internet and depending on if you’re close to your router or have a booster. The convenience is amazing. I already have Internet/TV through Fios So I’m not using this in lieu of paying for TV programming. However one of the biggest bonus is that I can link it to accounts where I have already bought Movies on demand. So all of the family movies I bought pre-release on demand through files can be viewed on any TV with the fire stick. Yes it is tied to the TV is plugged in it. It is connected to the Internet at your house or wherever that you use. The idea is not that you can take it with you on the go and still have your same channels and programming so keep that in mind if that is how you plan on using this.

"Works well at showing streamed programs -- when the streaming is properly working, which is mostly (but not always) the case.  You need a fast Internet connection for this to work at its best; mine downloads at about 70 MBPS which is almost always good enough.  The documentation is shoddy, but with only a few buttons to play with, you can figure it out.  A complication is that vendors of streaming services do not necessarily treat the buttons in the same way, so if you can cadge a manual from your streaming service provider, you will be ahead of the game. (I haven't tried to do this.)Later: The device found an interesting -- and annoying -- failure mode: it would drop the connection from Hulu (our streaming service) such that one would have to use the remote to re-access the program.  This started happening more and more often (as frequently as once a minute), and finally made the device unusable.  I replaced the first one which I had when it did this -- and eventually the new one did it also.  Amazon suggested un-installing the device, and then re-installing it (a nuisance), and this seemed to have fixed the problem.  (Amazon provided an instruction sheet describing how to do this.)

I had started with a Roku for my streaming needs but then things started happening I would constantly have to reset the Roku muplitible times. So when this went on sale a couple of weeks ago after the Roku froze again for what seemed like the  1000th time I looked on Amazon and saw that this was on sale. I have always heard good things about the fire stick and fire tv and having owned a kindle fire I am like ok so I took the plunge and bought this. I used it tonight for a little bit and it was like night and day. It didn't freeze up it worked flawlessly and I didn't have to reset it  I guess I should have gone with the fire stick long ago not to mention how much faster it is compared to the roku. If you are on the fence on buying of these don't be this product is amazing. You can get plently of viewing entertainment with this and for free as most of it is free. I have Hulu and I have prime so I get plently to watch along with cable for the locals actually we are sharing my mothers internet so the cable tv is basic nothing more if you are looking to cut the cord so to speak def get this it is so worth it.

Despite this not working as intended, and people on the internet complaining about this, Tech Support just asks me to FDR the device. I've already done that TWICE and it hasn't resolved the issue. Additional issues include: CEC HDMI response is non existent (the device doesn't turn on the TV and change input to the Fire TV) and also, YouTube videos are frequently out of sync between video and audio.

"So glad they finally added volume control to the remote.  It was the one thing the remote needed the most.  I only give 4 stars because on two occasions now while was watching multiple episodes of the same series in one day the thing froze and said I had no internet connection but I did have internet connection because I talked to my other alexa devices and they worked fine.  So I'm not sure if the freeze up is with the firestick after being in use for so many hours straight or with YouTube TV, which is what I was using to stream the episodes on demand.  I do know the only way to get it to work again when that happened was to go to settings, Firestick, restart firestick.  Thus the 4 stars.  Also I wish they would  add YouTube TV to the live TV choices.  you have to add it as a separate app.  There is functionality the other live tv apps get to have via Firestick that YouTube doesn't because they haven't added it as a live tv choice.

Decided to buy after reading reviews and it’s definitely better at streaming! I don’t really have any sound/video matching while watching at all. However sometimes there is still a lag and the fire stick freezes my tv even though my laptop or phone is still playing. Initially I thought it was spotty WiFi connection, but this has happened a few times when I’m right next to the router too.",4,1,2020-1-29,1,1,0
"The Fire Stick does not work with Spectrum, doesn't even have a Spectrum app at all. On top of that, most of the tv channel apps don't work with Spectrum either. They don't allow you login with Spectrum as your provider, the button just leads to a blank screen. If you have any other provider it appears to work fine, but us Spectrum customers? Thrown to the wolves, left out to dry, utterly neglected; its truly unbelievable that everything with Spectrum isn't seamless after how long these complaints have been going on for. If there is no plans to fix these issues then Spectrum needs to be removed as provider from all apps, and Amazon needs to enforce that. Amazon also needs to have a disclaimer on their products that they do not work with Spectrum TV.One of the best parts about this, is I talked to Amazon support about these issues with some of the channel apps and their response was to reach out to the app developer or my service provider. Hilarious, I, as the customer need to make sure the apps on your product are working properly? Not a great way to sell a product, eventually the word will get around.",1,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"Dear Amazon - this product is really a disappointment. I purchased my 4k stick on Ebay not Amazon...sorry about that. But just the same - I'm not happy at all with this product. The very slight improvement in resolution is TOTALLY diminished by the fact the picture is so darn dim. In order to view this device you need to change the TV's picture mode to ""Game"" or make other custom luminance (increase) settings on the display (TV). Then whenever you watch anything else (such as if you are viewing all your sources via a 4k AV receiver) you then need to change the display (TV) back and forth to the appropriate display settings. THIS REALLY SUCKS! and I only hope you (Amazon) are trying to get this resolved.....after all, it's already been over 9 months since release. From everything I read online, MANY if not all your users of this product are experiencing the same thing....Thus, this device maybe your lemon and will need to be recalled. On the other hand, Netflix 4k is a dream.... Love-it!",1,1,2019-2-25,1,1,0
"Edit#2: this is about three weeks from the original review. After a few set up issues, we have been using it consistently for over a week with zero issues. When it’s set up and when it works, it is fantastic. Amazon has also followed up with us to see if they could help us in any way so that was nice.Edit: Shortly after I submitted the original review my remote just stopped working completely. As I said below, I already had trouble getting it set up in the first place so this is just doubly frustrating that a few days later it connects to my TV only but now doesn’t work to connect to the app. I don’t know what is going on with this thing.",3,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I always stayed away from the fire tv in the past as my experience with the first generation fire tv stick were horrible. Always lagging, slow and with constant freezes I ended up returning the onces I picked up for black Friday deals with in 2 weeks.My go to had been Shield TV ever since but this latest gen Fire TV 4k has definitely made a huge impact on my opinion about Fire TV stick. Now I can confidently say this the best bag for the buck amount the streaming media contenders. Don't get me wrong Shield TV is definitely a monster but costs as much as well. This is 1/4 of the cost and meets the needs of a regular streaming media binge watcher just fine. For the cost of 1 Shield tv I can buy 4 of these bad boys and hook them up to every tv or hdmi monitor I have.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I've had the original Fire TV box since day one when I started desperately looking for a cable read: ""Devil"" replacement. That tech was very impressive and ahead of everything else that Roku or Amazon released for years. Then I bought a 4K TV last year and I just wasn't getting the quality I expected for a said next wave television. I thought it would still be killer to just watch and listen to my TV with the same original Fire box. Then I started realizing that it you have 4K TV nothing's going to look right unless you have 4K equipment, no matter how good your imagination is. So I finally took the plunge with this hot new 4K Fire TV stick and while I was impressed it wasn't  mind blowing or anything. So first, I noticed that what looked terrible on my year old 4K TV specifically the Home screen looked crisp and new again. Though only a bit better than an original 1080p Fire TV box on a 1080p TV (Sceptre). At least it looks the way it should again I thought. Then I watched some Terminator 2 on Sling TV. Then I was blown away, the film looked as good as I remember it looking on an old analog glass screen TV when I had a child's ""eagle eye vision""! I was blown away, it was on the part when Sarah Connor was attacking the creator 's family. I thought I was going to die! So obviously this stick enhances standard Sling TV definition too. I had my GPX speakers hooked up too and I was terrified, it was that immersive! Finally! I can enjoy watching internet TV! Music sounds mostly the same though to be honest. I eventually turned off my speakers to try turning up and down the volume after I saw I was at least able to turn the TV off and on. I noticed that the TV's native sound had gotten better too. Though still nowhere as good as speakers are. There's so many 4K stick only options that improve sound and picture quality. The thing is super fast, as fast as the original box. Some things work incredibly faster than that. The whole experience still feels flimsy to me though with these things. Though that's the intentional design I guess. So I'm only giving it 4 stars.",4,1,2019-3-1,1,0,0

"In a little independent comparison study, we bought the Roku 4K Premiere and the Fire Stick 4K at the same time, and set up each on two similar TV's.  Not being too critical of the new Roku...it did pretty much as it should, although the unit did run a bit overly warm to the touch, we thought.  We first used the HDMI cord shipped with it, but had some glitches and even had an onscreen message suggest that the proper HDMI cable should be used for newer capacity (or some such wording) device.  We also used another HDMI to check it out, but similar results.  No such issues with Fire Stick, (although Hulu itself and not other services did require a couple of restarts over the last few weeks) and we simply enjoy the interface better.  Plus, although I didn't think the Alexa voice feature would be one I would tend to use much, I find that we really do.  ""Alexa, find (whatever favorite show) on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Video, whatever"" is pretty simple - although Alexa needs some specifically worded instructions sometimes.  It's fairly intuitive to adjust to that syntax, though.  All in all, not hating on the Roku - have used Roku for years with an older model - we just plain like the Fire Stick better.  So we bought a second one, and gave the Roku away...they're all pretty inexpensive, and ditching cable will save us enough in one month to pay for the second one, anyway - with a few bucks left over.",5,1,2018-11-22,1,1,0
"What I liked about these  (I purchased two) was the picture quality,  crystal clear!  and that there are channels you can watch live instantly for free.  If not for the Fireticks,  The house would not have been able to view the Superbowl.  Our local air channel blocked our satellite company for more money and we had disconnected our ""air"" antenna a while ago.  So frantically I was trying to get the fire sticks up and running.  I was worried  as I didn't understand some of the set up.  That is what I disliked about  it.  The set up was not as cut and dry as I was told and some of my TVs are not smart tvs and other are but I had to use the HDMI connection in order to have my smart tvs work with the.  They are already HDTVs so I'm confused about that.  When I have more time I'll be calling TEch support for some questions I have.  But for now THANK YOU AMAZON FIRE STICK HD 4K for  having the Fox Sport app Live for instant streaming  and LIVE viewing for FREE!!!  All was very happy  as everyone thought  they would not get to see the Superbowl.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"First let me say I love Amazon! I gave this Firestick 4 stars for only one reason, I would like to see a back light on the remote control. It would make it so much better for  people my age (73) to see the buttons on the remote more clearly at night. That was the only thing I miss about Dish, their lighted remote control. We cut the cord on cable and bought the Firestick so that we could watch tv by streaming, it is more affordable and no contracts! The Firestick is easy to connect, affordable and you don’t have all the extra pieces of equipment sitting under your tv. Highly recommend this almost perfect Firestick!",4,1,2019-11-22,1,1,0

I like the programs that I am able to find with this player. I am very pleased with the internet that I can go to and I can find my exercise program on it. I have a Roku but I really like The Fire TV Stick now. Wish I would have set all my TV's up with it.One thing I really wish is that you can buy a cover or it came with some reflective color as it is smaller and harder to find than the other brand.  We spent an entire afternoon looking for it after grandkids left and it had slid down in the new entertainment section and was inside the black legs that connect. We looked and looked with flashlight and I finally found it. Just a thought as it would be nice to have a color you could see in the dark.,5,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0
"This is the best streaming device you can get in the market right now. The setup was super easy and took me about 10 min to finish. Alexa integration is the best part of this device. She recognizes my voice almost 99% of the time. I was stunned with the accuracy of the alexa. It saves alot of time and avoids burden of typing using the remote. The only drawback is, i am using this on my projector and firestick doesnt support it very well. For example i cannot use firestick remote to control volume or switch on/off my projector. I tried couple of workarounds but finally i gave up. Hence im using two remotes now; one for firestick and one for my projector. I recommend this product.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
Purchased this to try over the Roku Ultra and after a month or so I went back to the Roku Ultra. These are my reasons why. No Vudu. You can download it through the downloader but only in standard and not 4k. The layout is terrible. Cluttered layout that just seemed to get in the way. Your apps should be on top but instead recently watched is and all it does is make everything look like it is duplicated. Dolby vision and Atmos seemed to work part of the time. Still an upgrade to the backwards Roku Ultra that only handles HDR and Dolby Digital/DTS. I switched back due to the simplicity of the Roku Ultras home screen that made sense and was not a cluster and the fact that Roku has Vudu. Other issue that I almost forgot with the fire stick was the screen going blank and the lack of memory. Could have installed an sd card slot. Fire stick eats memory quickly and I had to delete apps because of the lack of memory. I hope the next gen devices correct these issues. I know a lot of people love the fire stick 4k and that's great. It just wasn't for me.,1,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I'm giving the firestick no stars due to the fact that the instructions give you absolutely no idea how to open the remote to insert the batteries. WTF! I have to watch YouTube to figure it out.

"I bought the first generation of the fire stick a few years ago to check it out.  The constant buffering problems drove me crazy and eventually back to satellite tv.  This version of of the fire stick 4k streaming along with a new alexa remote is a vast improvement from the earlier model I had.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and can report that it functions great out of the box.  I did buy an lan extender for it with and ethernet extender so I could directly connect it to my router.  I have tried it without the ethernet cable plugged in and I didn’t notice too may buffering issues without the ethernet cable.  But my router is right next to the tv so I didn’t expect too many problems.  For me the biggest selling point, is that fire stick is  compatible with Disney+ and it mirror sharing app is the only thing that works with my ipad and iphone.  I have a samsung smart tvs at home and mirror casting won’t work with any of my apple devices due to the bad blood between the two companies.  Being able to cast through the fire app makes my webex/zoom work meetings so much easier since like so many people I need to work from home during COVID-19.  The reason this is a four star instead of five star review is the for some reason the colors are little cooler on the fire stick tv compared to the other inputs and the tv won’t allow me to adjust.  Again I don’t know if this is limited to samsung tvs, but it is a little annoying not to be able to control the color vibrancy on the fire stick like I can with other inputs.",4,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I like the product, overall, but no less or moreso than say...a Roku.  But the home and pause buttons mid lower above volume, I am finding I often, very often hit the home when I mean to pause, even when I think I have the correct button.  They are small, in my opinion, and their shape or possibly shallow rise does not lend well to differentiation between button and case.Super annoying.

"I've been using Windows 7 Media Center for my home DVR (don't laugh, it works great). But when the PC running it started to crap out I looked for alternatives. I got a good deal on this on Prime Day, along with a Fire TV Recast it replaces my recording setup for less than what a PC replacement would. This setup does have the advantage of watching recordings at all my TVs, providing I get a Fire TV Stick for each one (no, I don't thing moving the stick from TV to TV is practical)The interface is a bit lacking. Granted I'm coming from a very TV focused DVR setup to this, which is more streaming focused. However this interface is mostly an advertisement for Prime content, with a sprinkling of links to other streaming services. When you add in the Fire Recast you do get local channels, both live and recorded, but you can tell that part is definitely an afterthought. You are mostly encouraged to watch streaming, and just getting to the live TV channel guide is sometimes difficult. Most of the time I find myself just hitting the mic button and telling it to show the guide. It's nice that there are voice controls, but in some ways you are forced into using them unless you want to spend a lot of time looking.",3,1,2019-8-9,1,1,0
"This thing is the new performance king of the fire TV family and out performs the old TV stick by a landslide. our provider is Directv now and the app used to be extremely sluggish on the 2nd gen Firestick.i used to be envious of my friends Apple TV cuz it runs the app really well. Now, with the new fire stick, everything loads up in an instant and the guide is butter smooth, just like the Apple TV for less than half the price! and it beats the Apple TV on the amount of 3rd party app support as well. you can side load apps make the fire stick do many amazing things!and the remote, I love the remote. no other streaming device's remote is universal at this moment. I used to have three remotes. one for TV, one for sound bar, and one for the streaming device. now everything is combined into one. all the controls shrunk into a small remote, with a few buttons, but that's all you need. amazing!",5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0

I have a lower priced Kindle Fire. All the same offerings but with ads. This is kind of the same. I was watching a commercial and it prompts me to click for a discount. While that's good for some, I found it a bit invasive, but hey, it's Alexa!Speaking of Alexa. It does not work nearly as well as my Kindle of phone app. It's a watered down version or ""new employee"" version, because it seems confused! lol If you ask for one thing you might get told ""she"" doesn't understand or you might get a completely different result. It connects then disconnects to the tv. It kept turning my fan on rather than changing the volume. My fan isn't a ""smart fan"" it was just on the same extension cord. If Weird.

"This device failed to meet my expectations, but I found a simple work around.  It is used with and controls the TV that was connected to fiber optic cable.  To access EZVideo (another amazon product), the Firestick was plugged into a USB port on the TV by Willamette Valley Fiber cable installers. When I turned the TV on the entire system had to boot up and I had to go through 6 to 7 control operations before I had a channel to watch.  This was a topic of conversation today at a meeting of several ham radio operators, and we came up with an easy solution.  I obtained a USB cable with a wall wart.  The Firestick plugs into this cable to satisfy its power requirements.  Now, when I push the ""On"" button on the TV control it is just a matter of seconds before I have a viewing platform available!  Of course Firestick is on continuously 24 hours a day, but I no longer need to wait for the device to boot up. So, it did not meet my expectations until I and a group of other ham radio operators came up with the current solution.  My advice to prospective users: DO NOT plug it into the USB port on the TV, but get a proper cable with USB extender connection and plug the wall wart into house power. Let it run 24 hours a day and your TV will come on very quickly.",1,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"We decided to cut the cord and go 100% digital services, specifically YouTubeTV.  We have 3 TVs (non-4K) in the house that do not have ""Smart"" apps so I needed a way to add them.  The Amazon Fire stick was the perfect choice.  Not only did it do all the App we needed (YouTubeTV, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Now and Disney+) but it also controls the TV power and volume.  I compared this to the Roku options and to get the TV controls, I would have had to pay much more for their more expensive 4k capable devices.  Total waste of money, besides, what 4k TVs do not have smart features built in.The only issue I've run into is that on a much older Philips TV, I was getting a ""Format not supported"" message, but a quick google search provided the solution.  Also, I've noticed a bit of a lag when navigating menus, but nothing that wouldn't prevent me from recommending this to all my friends.  My wife wishes that they would stay in the app you used last.  When turning the TV on, she has to go to YouTubeTV each time, but that is also minor.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

They must be getting this question a thousand times a day (literally) but they don’t want to answer it.  Before finally admitting that they don’t support it, they referred me to my cable provider 5 or 6 times, which was nonsense.

"My old Firestick stopped working.  I had it for several years.  Wasn't sure if this would work with my Sony 2011 tv, but didn't see much choice except buying an older version -- but didn't think that was wise.  I have the tv hooked up to a JVC receiver and Bose surround sound speakers that are ancient but still give excellent sound quality, so don't want to buy a new replacement for them --IMO newer electronics are rarely better quality than older.Long story short, this took about 5 minutes to set up and unbelievable to me, gave me options to select the brand of receiver, and what do you know, the Firestick now controls the old sound system via the remote.  That makes me a happy camper.  If the old firestick had that option, I never found it.  All the years when setting up remotes and receivers was a huge hassle, looking for the right brand # to punch in, not having it work, blah de blah.

"Bought my first firestick and loved it so much went back to buy a second one, since it is so easy to transport to a different TV in the house.  The 4K stick was the only one I could get at Best Buy as the basic ones were sold out ($10 cheaper).  After talking to sales guy, he said didn't have to have a 4K TV...I had read reviews and thought well maybe in the future might get 4K, so I went ahead and bought.  I have a two story house and I could use the first firestick anywhere in the house.  The 4K which I was trying to use in my bedroom(furthest from my router/modem) said marginal signal, and I could not get a picture, so I just thought have to get a stronger router/modem.  But I thought might be worth a try to use the basic stick that I had in the family tv and was using to transport between the two tvs until I got this 2nd one.  Sure enough no problems getting a signal with the original plain stick....Crazy huh??  Not sure what the problem is, but because of this have to give 3 stars.

The remote control is Bluetooth, there is only one universal remote option I could find, it's the Logitech harmony hub.

"The Fire TV Stick 4K does everything it is advertised to do, and does it well.  Compared to one ""casting device"", the Fire TV Stick is heads and shoulders ahead of the game.Obviously, the direct tie to the Amazon video library is a plus, but the wide multitude of apps is also outstanding.  In my experience, the only comparable system, though with somewhat different approaches, is the Roku system built into the TV to which this is attached.  It is notable that the two systems actually can be complementary, not redundant.  Some apps, for example, available on both systems, seem to function better on one or the other.  Other apps (i.e., ""Tatort"" from 'das Erste' German network) are only available on one or the other.  {Another example, Roku also has its own channel streaming older movies and TV shows.} Coupled with Prime, The Fire TV Stick provides access to potentially thousands of hours of [nominally] free entertainment, albeit for an annual fee.

"I have 2 Echo Dots and I thought this Fire Stick would be the perfect addition to help us control the TV with our voice when our hands are busy. We have two kids. The main show we watch is Spongebob Squarepants on Prime. ""Alexa, play Spongebob Squarepants on Fire TV."" Nothing. After research we figured out how to get her to turn the TV on but that was the limit for controlling the TV itself. No volume options. When she finally understands us enough to pull up Spongebob on TV she can't play any of the options by voice because there are so many different choices for Spongebob. We tried everything we could think of including telling her specific season/episode combinations and after feeling defeated, we called customer service who confirmed that it won't play by voice control because there are too many options. FINE. We will watch something else when we have to use our voice. After telling Alexa to play Mickey Mouse Clubhouse over the course of a few days I realized she goes to the same episode every time, not where we left off. Another strike. The final straw which is making me return the device is the fact that Alexa seems to have selective hearing. ""Alexa, pause."" Nothing sometimes, sometimes she will do it. I get this enough from my husband and kids. I don't need more defiance from a 'smart' device. We are beyond frustrated and I really had my hopes up for this.

He said all that would work my the fire stick so I took it and from the start it wasn't smooth scrolling thru the menus really bumpy and it was just shut off sometimes while using it and I would have to unplug it and start it over. So during the holiday sales I got this the 4k fire stick with a dot 3rd gen for 50 bucks so i jumped on the deal if the stick worked the same as the older one no big deal at least i got a dot out of it witch every one needs!!! But to my surprise this thing thing is way better than the first gen, it's much smooth and faster. Load times could be better but that's probably because I'm using 2.4gh instead of my 5gh wifi so it connected to all my other alexa stuff like my speakers lights cams ect.. so yes I would recommend this 100%",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"The Gen 1 fire stick that my daughter and her husband gave us almost 5 years ago was really showing it's age and taking forever to respond. I had been thinking about upgrading for the past year, but couldn't resist the deal this week. Only $20 for the 4K, after a $5 rebate for return my 1st gen. A no-brainer. Even after way too many G&T's, it didn't take all that long, for this retired, old geezer, to enter passwords for my network, netflix and hulu. My Prime, Acorn and Britbox (thru amazon) were detected without login.  What a difference the 4k made in response time.Don't ask me about Alexa. I refuse to talk to some spying, intimate object, so I can't comment. I think you may need some other gizmo for the remote to work, but either way, that ain't happening in my house.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0

"I started out with an expensive android box and the company went out of business and sold out to a company that has NO customer service. Aside from that, I was the only person in our family who could use it. My husband is very computer illiterate and hated it! It was a learning process to use! Now, it was time to replace it before said husband threw it down the road, so after watching LOTS of videos on these things, it came between this or the Nvidia which was way more expensive so we are trying this. So far this is an 11 on the scale compared to the old android.I got up this morning and found my husband had the TV on, with his favorite channel no less and he did it all by himself with NO guidance from me! His first time even! OMG was I a happy camper. It has the big picture boxes to choose, and altho there is free IPTV services with no too great quality picture, I do pay 9.00 per mo. for an awesome IPTV service of 6000 channels and HD quality live TV. So, if you need something simple and great to use, try this and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I purchased this on my own with no payment for review.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Really truly hate this product.  I purchased it because Amazon stopped supporting my older Sony device I was using for streaming.  I've used this item a  couple days now and it is extremely lacking.  I would return it if I had any other option to stream Amazon Prime related content.  The UI is cluttered.  There are all kinds of things shoved all over the screen even after I filter to my Amazon Watch list.  It only allows for one row of options and the rest of the screen is all unwanted click here types of things.  It is virtually impossible to find content without knowing exactly what you are looking for.  The player also does not display Prime specific content vs additional charge content until after you click on the content.  I really just want to see the things that are include with Prime, not get excited to watch something and find that it costs more money.  I also dislike the fact that all the Amazon streaming devices include Alexa (Spy ware) built in.  Again, I don't want it, but am forced to bring a microphone into my home to use a service that I have paid for.  The microphone will not work long though, then again I have found myself watching more Netflix on my old device, and my family has already discussed canceling Prime all together.  If it wasn't for the 2 day shipping it would have already been canceled.  This is an epic fail by Amazon.  This device should be so much better and just isn't.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  I read the reviews of the bad UI and they are all correct in how terrible it is to use.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I took advantage of holiday pricing and picked this up as a replacement to an original Fire Stick.  I have to say, the performance increase in significant, and the new features make it well worthwhile.  The new remote integrates with the rest of my audio visual equipment, and includes volume control.  The Alexa integration is tighter, with increased functionality.  My Echo device can now turn on and off the television, play music through the attached receiver and speakers.  This version of the Fire Stick offers 4K video support.  While my television is only 1080P Full HD, the device produces even clearer video that it's predecessor.Again, I feel this is definitely a worthwhile upgrade even if you don't have a TV that supports 4K.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,1,0
"We had an old Fire Stick on my bedroom TV but didn't have a compelling reason to use it regularly because we bought a Samsung Smart TV. When the 4K Fire Stick went on sale I bought it, hoping it would solve a few problems for us and it did. Streaming is faster and less pixelated than before. The picture overall is much better. More importantly, I can now avoid having to use the ugly interface and versions of apps that come with my TV because I can replace that completely with the Fire Stick's landing page and apps. The apps are more current and a critical app like You Tube is laid out better than the version Samsung uses. I LOVE the volume buttons on this version of the remote because I can leave my soundbar remote in my nightstand and don't have to fidget with two remotes anymore. I'm not sure how or why, but when I set up this stick it paired with my Sony sound bar and woke it up to get recognized by the Alexa/Echo ecosystem and I can now control it with voice commands, which I was not able to do myself manually before.  Why that happened, I don't know, but I'll take it. I also bought an after-market silicone remote cover in a bright blue color that protects it when it's dropped on the floor and makes it easy to find between blankets and pillows on the bed, which has improved the whole Fire Stick experience even more. I use one remote for the stick, TV and sound bar now and love it!",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

I placed a call to Amazon regarding a fire stick- 4K that has broken for the second time. The 1st time it broke I received a replacement the next day. Now for the second broken Fire stick-4K I am being told it is out of stock and I can’t get it until Tuesday by one of your supervisor. I went on the website and saw that If I order the Firestick in the next 8 hours I can receive it tomorrow. I was just lied to. I placed a second call to Amazon and was told that the rule is based on the deliver area that I will receive the item from now up until Tuesday. Now you have Fire-stick -4K  and they are not on back order? I want a replacement for the second broken Firestick 4K. I have been lied to and told they are on back order and that because I called after 3pm nothing can be done until Monday. My understanding is Amazon is 24 hours and are breaking ground on delivery.

"Nothing to dislike about this Fire Stick.  I have the original one and it still works fine,  but this one is faster,  the quality of the picture is better and so easy to use.  I love it!!  You will not be disappointed with this for sure.  I had a little problem with the closed caption,  but when I tried it again it was super easy to use and adjust to my viewing.  The first thing I asked Alexa to do was to turn up the volume,  which she did and it was perfect!  I especially like the on and off switch which also turns my TV off and on.  As long as your TV is HD it will work for you!  Enjoying this so much!!!  Highly recommend!!!",5,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0
"I have used Apple TV and Roku, both with ethernet cable connections.  This Amazon Firestick is much better than those, even though it only uses wi-fi.  The hi-def resolution is better for some reason, as well as the sound.  The remote is easy to use, unlike the Apple tv remote which is a disaster.  Now that the Firestick includes volume control, I only have to deal with one remote.  It also comes with Silk, a kind of rudimentary internet browser, which could be used in a pinch (the cursor is a circle that you move around with the remote).  One other cool thing is that if you have Sling TV, you get a ""previous channel"" button (it is called Recall).  This is very useful.I knocked my rating down a couple of stars.  The interface screen is getting ridiculous, almost impossible to navigate.  It also defaults to show you shows you have to pay for, even if you only want Prime (free) shows.  Not good.  Somebody needs to do a lot of work on the interface.  It is most definitely not user friendly.",3,1,2019-7-20,1,1,0
"Just received this new Fire Stick TV 4K this evening. The instructions provided are worthess. I made all the connections, plugged in the fire stick to outlet, and then as directed on the TV, held the Home button next to the Fire stick for 10 sec which then caused the remote to start flashing a white/blue LED. Nothing else worked and the instructions on the TV (in every language on the planet) just tell  me to press the Home buttone on the remote. DId that and nothing else appears on the TV. This is ridiculous. I bought this to replace my First generation Fire TV box (which worked but was getting slow) on a special price from Amazon. Guess I'll box this thing up and return.Really upset about this...you would think the instructions that came with this would be a little more instructive and not tell you ""after pairing  your remote follow the on screen instructions to control power and volume of TV. And nothing to tell you exactly what pairing is or what to do if you don't get the on screen directions.",1,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"I had high hopes for this 4K Fire stick.  I've used their older fire stick and had issues in which movies would pause in the middle and you'd have to unplug the fire stick to correct the issue.  Then I switched to Roku and that has been working like a charm for a couple of years.  However, the lure of watching movies in 4K was too tempting and when I saw this go on sale, I decided I'd see how it works.After three weeks, I am disappointed.  First, the 4K movies that are available are very few, and none that are very good.  If you are buying this to watch 4K movies, the selection is only on Amazon Prime and there are only a  handful to choose from.  Note, I have a cable provider so I didn't buy this as a television or cable replacement - the main reason I bought this was faster processing speed, 4K movies, and the Alexa feature on the remote.",3,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
"I like the price drop, first and foremost ,there is almost no lag time between channel changes, unlike the standard firestick which takes a while to go between channels. The picture quality is great also along with the media access if you already have Prime. My only complaint is an error code coupled with a picture freeze sometimes, I'm not sure if it's the firestick or it's HULU. At any rate the selection and overall performance has been good, if we see an increase in the error code then we'll investigate to see where the issue actually is. Here's the bottom line, it's a much cheaper deal than any cable provider as long as you have high speed internet.",4,1,2019-8-31,1,1,0
"Before you start reading, let me warn you now, if you are an Apple hater don’t bother finishing this review. I have Apple TV in my living room and master bedroom and did not want to fork out $180 on one for the spare bedroom. I purchased this when it was on sale for $25. I hooked it up side by side (separate hdmi inputs) on my living room tv to compare to the Apple TV. Right away I was disappointed. There is a noticeable difference in the video quality of the two units. The fire stick is not as clear. Apple TV is very intuitive and the fire stick is not. The fire stick is also much slower. Perhaps the biggest complaint I have is that the fire stick has frozen  up to the point where the remote will not recognize the unit, even when I tried the restart button combination! I’ve had to unplug power three times in the last three weeks! I’ve owned three different generations of Apple TV over the years, and never had a hang up this severe!My advise is this. If you already have Apple TV, pass over the fire stick. If you’ve never had an Apple TV, give it a try. My brother and nephew love their fire sticks. (Never had Apple TV)",3,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0

"I have several Roku devices and a Fire TV stick and a Fire TV Stick 4 K.  I got the 4K Stick in Feb 2019 per my purchase history.  After spending approx an hour with tech support, (Amazon tech support is great, Fire Sticks are not) I finally got my problem resolved by doing a complete factory reset, which means I had to go through everything I went through to set it up when I first took it out of the box.  The issue was with the Alexa part of the Fire Sticks.  I had the same issue with both the Fire Stick and 4K Fire Stick.  While I was playing Jeopardy or when Alexa was speaking for more that a few seconds, the Alexa voice would just stop.  Like I said the other features worked just fine.  However, the Roku device seems more user friendly to me.  It offers more channel options, and I have never had to do a factory reset even on Roku devices I have had for several years.  Don't get me wrong.  I love Alexa, I have a 7 and 8 inch Fire Tablet (which is connected to the docking station to make it work like an Echo Show), I have  2 Echo Dots and an Echo spot, and I think they are all great.  I have Alexa set on my Android phone as my default voice assistant.  I have many smart home, car, etc devices connected to Alexa.  So many in fact, that I have issues if my internet is out.  If you want TV streaming device buy a Roku.  If you want an Alexa device, get an Echo Spot, Dot, a Fire tablet 8 inch or bigger I would suggest, and though I don't have them an Echo or an Echo show, would probably be great too.  (Along the same note, Amazon is not permitting reviews on the new Echo Auto yet.  I got one as soon as I got my invitation.  I have the same issues with the Echo Auto that I have with the Fire sticks.  Alexa's voice stopping, also have issues with my Flash Briefings not working, and it is worthless when using it for directions due to the voice issues.  When I am able to review it, it will get 1 star or maybe two.  And Amazon has a list of vehicles that Echo does not work with.  My truck is not on that list, so it should work fine.)  Again, I am an Amazon and Alexa junkie, but I will not buy another Fire Stick or another Echo Auto.",3,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0
"I have watched numerous Prime videos on my PC and was always pleased as I was able to watch whatever I wanted at anytime.  I always got a quick response when I chose a video to watch and had uninterrupted viewing.  Based on on my experience with my PC I decided to get the Fire TV Stick so I could duplicate my viewing experience in another room on a larger screen.  However, this didn't happen.  Yes, I was able to watch some videos but many times I received a message about insufficient bandwidth or slow internet speed.  So, my experience with viewing videos on TV hasn't been as good as watching on my PC.  Perhaps I should have simply purchased a larger monitor and not bothered with the Fire TV Stick.I  was unable to insert the Fire TV Stick directly into the back of my TV because of space limitations.  I could have used the extender that came in the package but I chose to buy a  longer cord that better suited my situation.

I received it quickly and installation was very straight forward.  I know have all my streaming services in one place.

I use this fire stick (4k) on all of my TV's even those that aren't 4k just because I noticed a huge difference in the speed of the devices. its mainly noticed when switching tabs, loading applications and basically everything.So to sum up.

After a couple of hours trying different suggestions I found on the web, I found one that worked and was relieved that I wouldn't have to return this. It's important to know that it took me months to find a good, working streaming service and the only one that really worked reliably for me was YouTube TV.So after using the hack version of the YouTube TV app, I found that the audio was not synchronized with the video and even after trying to adjust the synchronization on my soundbar and TV, I couldn't get it to synch. Looks like the adjustments are to slow down the audio due to slow video, but in my case, the video was actually ahead of the audio and there appears to be no adjustment for that. At first I though this was because of the hack version of YouTube TV I installed, but I saw similar issues with Netflix, although not as bad.",1,1,2019-2-24,1,1,0

"The device functions well enough. The fact that it controls the volume and power on my projector is a nice touch The main problem I had was they removed the prime banners from the upper left corners of movie pictures.  What this means in practice(even if you tell alexa or type PRIME only followed by what you are looking for ie. PRIME only Elvis), is that free prime, pay to view, and subscription hawks, are all mixed together.  The only way to find out what it is, is to click on it to find out.  This makes searching for Prime content(that you paid for, by the way), impossible in a general search.  The only way to be certain is to browse withing the prime fixed menus.  Yes, you read it right, a general search is now impossible.  This is obviously an attempt to sell you more stuff, stuff I would have bought anyway.  Now I'm not buying anything off of them until they fix this, because searching is so ridiculously hard. I don't really need much stuff for my apartment this year(it's full), and my prime subscription may not be renewed because of this.  I don't mind Amazon trying to sell me things, I get that , but I wont have my time wasted.  This is the first time, I've been truly annoyed at Amazon in the 10 years I've done business with them.

Frames are dropped quite often when trying to stream 4k (it's not constant, but it does happen).

Using Verizon wireless I get charged twice for my data unless I can tether into the device and I cannot afford to be charged twice for my data. I have a 50 Gig account which costs $245 a month but using wireless, I only get to use 25 Gigs of that 50 Gigs and can barely get by on that 25 Gigs without any streaming. By Verizon's own admission, to use my Firestick for TV would cost somewhere between $1200 and $2000 a month for data. I tried their ""Unlimited Account"" that I thought would run the Firestick but there is nothing unlimited about Verizon's accounts and used the 20 Gigs that comes with the unlimited account in less than 2 days leaving me 28 days without internet for the rest of the billing month.

I am frustrated because: (1) the Fire Stick 4K suggested a controller that is not compatible with itself and (2) there is not currently a Amazon game controller that works with the Stick 4K.

"Fire stick 4k will turn any TV with an HDMI port into a smart TV. Even many smart TV's become smarter with the Firestick. Apps are available through a downloader app to accomodate most any watching need. I have completely dropped satellite and am now watching local channels through an HD antenna and any IPTV streaming service I choose all with the Firestick. You need a sufficient router being fed by decent internet service (mine is the lowest speed our local cable supplier offers and it works fine). Once in a while it will spool for a few seconds but very seldom. If you can hard wire your router to the TV it will provide the best service. If not, a router of sufficient power will suffice. A wireless extender will help get wireless to TV's in farther locations. I currently run 4 TV's, each with a Firestick 4k and am well pleased. Love the fact that the Firestick remote is the only one you need for operating the TV power and sound and accessing your channels. It is feasible to have free local channels and utilize free streaming services if you choose and not pay for watching TV. Or you can utilize any number of streaming services that charge a fee. Again, all this is done through the Firestick. I cannot say enough about how the Firestick brings together your TV viewing into one enjoyable and affordable arena. We have even set up a DVR for our local live TV channels where we can set up recording for up to 2 weeks. Streaming has come of age and if you acquire a proper router, sufficient internet service and do your homework you will never miss satellite or cable TV again, let alone the gigantic monthly bill.

"Like millions before us, we finally cut the cord.  Discounts were available for this device as well as a Roku 4K stick and I chose to purchase one of each for my 2 smart TVs, risking confusion in operating the 2 devices.  I'm happy with both, but the Fire Stick remote is more intelligently designed, with the voice button in a more conspicuous location and the volume controls also easier to find and operate.  Each remote needs buttons that light up in the dark, like my previous Cox Contour remote.  A nice feature with the Fires Stick was the HDMI extension adapter, since on my Samsung smart TV the stick would not fit without being left on an angle, which didn't seem to be an adequate connection.  Happy to join the cord cutters, saving over $100/month despite spoiling my family with YouTubeTV, Sling TV, Netflix, and Hulu.  But this is a fast evolving, new world and like smartphones, cable modems, wifi routers, let alone ISP service, I expect changes/advances in all the Sticks every 2-3 years.  Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"Overall I like this product very much. I've been using the Prime Video app extensively. This app is far better the Prime Video app on my Tivo and Xfinity X1. It starts streaming much faster. You can actually fast forward and rewind and see where you are in the video. I'm using the Amazon Ethernet adapter with this Firestick so I can't speak to the wireless performance. To power the Firstick/ethernet adapter combo I'm using a short USB cable plugged into my TV's USB port (a 2011 Samsung 55"" Plasma 3D TV). No problem doing this so far.My big issue w/the Firestick is the dark picture it produces. No amount of adjusting the Firestick's settings increased brightness. Customer support was no help. The background noise while speaking the the tech was so bad I had to end the call. My only solution was to increase the overall TV screen brightness. Not an ideal solution because now my other inputs are too bright. Based on how many hits I got searching for this problem it's a very common problem going back years. I'm kind of surprised Amazon has not fixed this. Maybe the next version?",3,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I bought this for my parents while they are away on their anniversary and wanted something easy for them and for the fact they HATE DirectTV (it’s pretty worthless unless you like nothing but infomercials and home shopping) and stuck in a contract until October.  So I Just received it today so I could set it up before they returned next week. It came neatly yet simply packaged. I wasn’t sure what to expect but it was so easy it was ridiculous. Just plugged it into one of the spare HDMI port then into power strip behind the tv stand, popped batteries into the remote, pressed power. It’s pretty self explanatory if you’ve ever set up a computer to a WiFi network and enter basic info. That’s it. We looked up some shows with Alexa along with some obscure music titles and it found them without a problem. Menues are simple and easy to navigate. Movies played perfectly with no issues even better than my Sony blue ray player. The price was definitely right and well worth it! I hope they enjoy it and I pray they don’t lose the remote with it being so small.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,1,0
"This a decent streaming device and works with many 3rd party streaming apps. The most important thing to me is now Disney+ can be used on my TV without screen mirroring from a mobile device. Since my cable carrier company does not allow the Disney+ app to be downloaded and run in their 'environment', we could not watch it without using a TV connected mobile device. Make sure you have an available HDMI port on the TV to plug in the Firestick and an electrical outlet close enough to the TV to plug in the Firestick power supply (included in the box). The only issue I had with setting up the Firestick was when I tried connecting it to my network. I'm not really sure what went wrong, but I got it to detect my router after two attempts, unplugging the power to the Firestick and waiting about 30 seconds both times and then trying again. Once I got it connected, it has stayed connected and works each time I select it from my TV or cable remote. Over all, I would recommend this product. Now it seems like a good time to seriously consider cancelling my cable service.",4,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"This firestick could be great, Amazon ruined it though.  Of the 8 gigs of memory, Amazon preinstalls about 5 gigs of their junk on it, so memory is at a premium.  I only had a handful of apps, History, TCM, ESPN, Netflix, and NBC installed and I was already receiving warnings I was about out of memory.  I used ES to delete out Amazon Photos, Alexa Shopping, Amazon this and Amazon that, Alexa this and Alexa that, live tv, news, etc.  I wish I could delete out game circle and a few others which seem to have no way or option of getting rid of them.Once I deleted out all the crap I didn't need I had a ton of room and the stick streamed fast.

"The Firestick delivers such a broad array of services and capabilities to your TV that it's utility is undeniable. The problem is the ultra-slow streaming. I have other streaming services that are delivered outside the Firestick, and I rarely, if ever, see the dreaded buffering donut. The Amazon Fire Stick buffers so much, it is not watchable. Unfortunately, the best resolution is to buy a new TV, or another device through which you can access the various streaming services, not using the Amazon Fire Stick to access them. I am beyond disappointed. Amazon tech support has a standard set of supposed fixes, but they will not help. You're stuck with paid streaming services that you cannot watch because the video pauses much more than it advances. The simple solution would be to buffer on the device, much more than is presently available, such that pauses don't affect the viewing experience. If the  ISP is causing this, I don't care, because that's beyond my control. My problem is I paid for a device. Just make the thing work or give me a refund. The damn thing sucks.",2,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
A lot faster than my old fire stick.  It may be due to the fact that I purchased the connector to plug cat 5 cable right into fire stick instead of using my wifi. I have 500 mbps though my ISP however i believe it is the fire stick that can't process data fast so i decided to purchase device and it makes my fire stick finally enjoyable.No more pausing to buffer when I'm using Kodi to stream. I love having access to all my favorite tv shows and movies without having to pay 5.99 to rent a movie. Finally I can stream without praying that it doesn't pause again to buffer.,5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I've been using this for a couple weeks now and very disappointed. It cannot handle streaming from an HD Homerun, it freezes up and you have to reboot the fire stick after about 30 min. Hooked my OG fire stick and these problems went away. Maybe it's something that can be fixed with an update, or maybe it's hardware related...I'm not patient enough to wait and find out.Just wanted to update this review. After seeing it I was contacted by Amazon with questions about my HDHomerun and was told they were working on a fix. The update came out a few days ago and it still does not work with my HDHomerun for more than an hour at a time. From what I've read on the HDHomerun forums Amazon is now blaming the HDHomerun app, even though it works fine with the old Firesticks.",1,1,2018-12-3,1,1,0
"Fair is fair.  When I purchased the ""All-New Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD and Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player"" back in Oct 2017, I slammed it.  It was slower than the ""Amazon Fire TV | Streaming Media Player"" that I purchased Dec 2016.  I complained and Amazon, to their credit, reached out to me to understand why I was so unhappy.  To me, newer tech should be smaller, cheaper, faster, and this wasn't faster, not by a long shot.Fast forward to my recent Prime Day purchase.  I am a very happy camper.  Not only is this device (a stick) better than the old device, it also now has a volume control and on/off button that controls my TV.  I am down to one remote.  How cool is that?",5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"I already own two Fire TV Cubes; I picked up the Stick for travel and vacation.  So far, so good.  The look and feel is identical to the Cubes, so the family had no issues operating the device.  It's responsive, and the picture quality is great.  But what I really like is the ability for the Fire TV Stick to navigate through WiFi captive portals (the page where you have to agree to terms before being allowed on some public WiFi networks).  The device comes with a short HDMI extension cable and a longer USB cable for power.  I swapped out the long USB cable for a 12"" cable.  It makes for a nice setup completely behind a TV -- the HDMI extension allows the Stick to fit into tight spaces around the TV inputs, and it can be powered right from a USB port on the TV.  Just realize that if you use a TV USB port for power, you will have to power on the TV to supply power to the Stick.  So no ""Alexa, turn on the TV"" if you set it up this way.  If you want voice power-on, you will need to power the Stick from an always-on USB port.Overall, I'm very happy with the Fire TV Stick, and so are my kids.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I am thrilled with my 4K Firestick. I bought one and almost immediately bought a second one for our guest room. In our townhouse, we could only have cable in the livingroom, as the Association does want cables running throught the house or in front of it. This solves that problem, so now we can have the full cable tv experience on any tv anywhere in our home, without the cost of cable. I cannot say enough good things about how easily and seemlessly it works. I got a 14 day free trial to Sling and liked it so much, I decided to subscribe to it and get rid of cable and can easily watch it through the Firestick. The firestick makes it easier to take advantage of Prime videos, which I almost never did before. I also added Pluto TV, and can easily see what's on live tv through the channel guide (for Sling AND Pluto) under the Live tab. I can also access my Hulu account and have everything in one place. I LOVE this thing so much, I convinced my sister-in-law to buy one too; she loves it as much as I do. You really can't go wrong. Buy it!",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0

"I've had 3 Fire TV devices now going back about 4 years. My original Fire TV had issues so I switched to Roku. I tried a regular Fire TV Stick a couple years ago, but the apps were not as polished as they were on other platforms, and the unit lacked the horsepower to have a smooth, fast interface. So I went back to Roku.Fast forward to now, and my Roku Stick + has begun to slow and have overheating issues. So I pulled the trigger on a new Fire TV Stick 4K. I'm happy to say that Amazon has finally caught up with, and surpassed, the competition with this product. Setup was a breeze. All the capability is there; all the speed and power the old ones lacked. Because of Amazon's reach and the rise of their in-house streaming products, the apps from popular services (like Sling TV), which used to be seriously flawed are now fantastic. I can control multiple AV devices (not just the TV), allowing for simultaneous yet individual settings for an additional soundbar. Wireless AC delivers the speed you need to flip quickly through libraries of 4K content.",5,1,2019-4-15,1,0,0
"I received this quickly, installed it with no problem, and started using. It seemed to load very slowly and then kept dropping the connection to the internet. I reloaded it, reset it and my network connection kept showing a very good connection and then it would show connection lost followed by reconnect 10 to 60 seconds later followed by a disconnect. I checked my WiFi router and it was solid and WiFi was working with all of my other devices very well. I read the reviews and questions trying to figure out if I was doing something wrong or whether the device was faulty. I had put it back in the box to return and decided that I should contact product support for some help before I returned it so I pulled it back out of the box, hooked it back up and it works GREAT. Fast, no disconnects, no problems. I have no idea what caused the difference but for right now I am a happy camper. My concern is that this may be short-lived but for now I am very pleased.

"I have purchased and recommended the 2nd generation fire sticks for a while. I have given a bunch as gifts. They really are remarkable products, with so much capability.  I purchased the 4k due to promotional pricing and I knew I was soon to be getting a new TV.  My 4 year old Samsung has been getting more and more vertical lines in it. I updated my AT&T internet service explaining I was going to want to stream 4k. As fate would have it, an irresistible deal came up on a 4k TV. Put older fire stick on one HDMI input, the new 4k on the HDMI/MHL input. Same picture!!! TV had problems, sent it back, got a new one. Same thing. When I choose a UHD show on the 4k fire stick, at the bottom, says Ultra HD, as soon as show starts, kicks to 1080. My internet speed tests through the fire stick show between 60Mbs and 100Mbs. Called the TV company and they say it's the fire stick or my internet and that I should buy a new DVD player to test the TV. AT&T says speed is sufficient for 2 4k's streaming at the same time. My sister has the 4k fire TV box, same thing. She does already have the Ultra Blue Ray DVD player and 2 pre-recorded movies. I must say 4k  is a beautiful picture. But I bought a 4k fire stick. NO 4k !!! Also, Alexa doesn't hear as well on the 4k as my other fire sticks.",2,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0
"I've had the regular non 4k Firestick now for about 3 years or so, and in the last year it has been going off line a lot telling me ""connected but with problems"", and buffering a lot, or we'll be in the middle of a show and it just kicks out back to the main screen. I thought it was my internet I have had really low speed (like 15mbps) for the last 5 years, I finally gave in and got higher speed and it seemed to make have made the issues worse.  So when a friend told me the 4k works a lot better. So I bought one when I saw an add on my fire stick to get one at $24.99 instead of $49.99 . I am very glad I did.I've not had one single issue It comes right on and no more ""connected with issues"" or ""not connected"" or ""Can't reach home page, no internet connection"" since I've switched, no more buffering, and no more kicking me out of apps!

"I purchased 3 of these altogether after buying 1 and trying it out and liking it for the most part. Mostly pro's here but a few cons. I never purchased a fire stick in the past due to their limited hardware and I never was a stream freak but for years I streamed music and movies locally from pc to pc using windows smb and kodi media center for htpc client in the living room. This year I remodelled the living room completely and parted ways with the laptop, 3dtv, and 5.1 surround sound. With new walls, flooring, and new furniture I decided to get a new tv and hanging shelf and do away with anything clunky and un-used. I purchased a Samsung QLED Q9F 65"" and wall mounted it above a hanging shelf and around that time I noticed as I was doing some shopping on Amazon that this new 4k fire stick had just released and it could run kodi with not much effort and handle 4k streams. My tv already had lots of online streaming apps but afaik not capable of running kodi or if possible it could I still didn't want to use a 3rd party app to download and install it on the tv memory so I chose the fire stick. All the online streaming apps run great and so does Kodi. The only con is that it doesn't have a good enough gpu and/or cpu to handle 4k remux or complete 4k bluray iso files without skipping. I had to encode to crf 17 and I think at that resolution the highest bitrate that works is 30MB/s or less. It bothers me that it is sooo close to being perfect but for the price it is totally worth it. It will play full 1080p remux and bluray img files flawlessly it's just that it wont quite do lossless 4k. It does however handle atmos 7.1 with no issues as far as I can tell and HDR as well. It also pairs well with my tv for the fact that it is almost the same remote in size and by design and for most functions it will even serve as the tv remote for almost everything. If you are bothered by the volume control on the Q9F remote then it helps to use the fire stick remote to turn the volume up or down instead of using bixby voice to do it in increments that you set. I havn't tested the wifi due to purchasing the ethernet jack but I do run a 5ghz wifi network and it should perform well due to being close to the access point but with local streaming I've always preferred wired. I'm amazed at what it does handle due to being small in size and fairly cheap in price but a future 4k fire box is in need of for anybody serious about lossless streaming. I'd say 8gb of ram/quad core intel cpu/gpu capable of rendering 4k res at full bitrate/and built in gigabit or 10gig ethernet and it should be able to monster everything around. In the meantime if you are running kodi from a pc for 3d and/or 1080p and you are looking to do 4k, then stick to pc with a 1080ti or better and lossless 4k aint a problem, but otherwise encoded 4k movies using profile main 10 with a crf of 17 will run perfect throughout the entire movie on this 4k fire stick. It is easy to setup hardware wise and during the on screen setup it's very straight forward. I'm only giving it 4 stars cause I think it should've had more ram, more memory for apps and storage considering solid state and thumb drives store so much in a small form factor these days, and gigabit should've been fit to the device directly and/or at least offered in addon adaptor. Even with a slightly higher price these perks could've put it at the top of the streaming tech race but if you don't have a fire stick at all and you have amazon prime, netflix, 4k movies of your own and time to encode them then don't hesitate to buy. It's totally worth it at it's current price.",4,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0
"Ours constantly loses sound. Whenever we turn the TV off and then on again we have to unplug the Firestick from the TV to get the sound to work.

Hopefully you get a good one, because ours is a pain. Also the Alexa portion doesn't understand what you are saying. I got it to work right once.UPDATE: I changed my review from 2 stars to 4.

"In early April there was an update released that brings back the mirroring feature, to find the update go to Settings > My Fire TV > About > Check For Updates.  What I liked about my old fire stick is after the initial pairing and getting it set up I no longer had to have the fire stick on a wifi network, this comes in handy when staying in a hotel, RV or cabin where wifi can be an issue or non-existent... I've also seen reviews by truckers who have sleeping cabs and a little tv in there.  As far as I know, this is the only device that allows you to mirror without the device being on a wifi network.This may not be a big deal to a lot of users but for those of us that did use it, we were a little upset that the option was removed.  During the initial setup, you will have to link the fire stick to a wifi network and get everything all set up but after that you will be good to go.  Keep in mind that when you do not have the fire stick on a wifi network you will not see any of the apps you have installed on the fire stick, you will basically only see settings (this is because the stick is not on a network).  After initiating the mirroring, simply fire up Youtube, Netflix or whatever app on your phone/tablet that supports mirroring, rotate the phone/tablet to landscape mode and start the video.",5,1,2019-4-29,1,1,0
"Amazon itself is pure quality as far as I'm concerned, and the fire stick has made it even greater. I would feel safe in saying that 90% of all that we order comes from Amazon.

With the fire stick we have so much to choose from when it comes to movies, documentaries, weekly programs, and so much more. We've barely scratched the service that comes with fire stick, yet we're already impressed with it. It is 100% bargain all the way.

After my husband and I got it all up and running, we had no idea how specifically to operate the system. For example, we did not know how to find the channel guide. I found the little fold out card and started reading off the quotes written there. You guys really need to raise your game when it comes to operating instructions. Everyone is not 20 years old. Some of us grew up in a time when we had to change channels by actually getting up and walking to the TV set to turn a dial. We have all come a long way since then. It would be terribly helpful if could meet us half way by providing decent instructions. Rant over!",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

I just finished setting up a home theater in my bedroom and decided to upgrade from the pervious Fire Stick, mostly to improve the connection.

We started with the concept to drive the costs of TV / Videos/ Media down.  We also looked at our Amazon purchases over the past few years and decided to step up to Amazon Prime.  Is this lower cost faster shipping or a media package or what not sure but this turned out to be one of the keys to this drive the cost down.  Purchased a long range in home antenna and several large flat antenna's.  This gave us local TV on our Flat Screens - not every channel but enough.  Then we were given an Echo - one of the best gifts ever.  Now own 3 Echo's.Then the move to Fire TV Sticks 4k - with the constant upgrading on Flat Screens and in delivery systems the slight increase to 4k we thought would be worth it long term.  No comment on that decision yet.  But we liked the first Fire Stick so much we now own 3 of them.

I kept having issues with the 1080p firestick.  It worked.  But had issues with keeping the quality of the stream.  At first I bought the Amazon Ethernet adapter which works well.  But I saw an article where the firestick 4k has better wifi and is faster.  I can honestly say it is faster and streams a lot better.  I also stream some content from websites.  And the 4k stick works almost as good as my computer.  The 1080p stick had many issues freezing.  I am so happy to get this on black Friday for $25.  But at $50 it is still worth it.

For example, the intro indicates that Alexa can navigate to the cable channels. However, what Intried exactly the same command and it did not work.

"I own several Streaming Devices, such as the Apple TV, Google TV, NVIDIA Shield, PlayStation, Xbox and have used the Streaming Apps in several generations of Samsung and LG TV's.  I've always loved the NVIDIA Shield (and still do) for it's Build Quality, Storage and Streaming Quality.  It was the only device providing 4K streaming for a while.  However, after recently purchasing several Alexa Devices for my home, I decided to try out the Amazon Fire TV 4K Stick.  This is by far the Best Device I have in terms of Streaming Quality (4K), Overall Availability of Streaming Apps (Well Except for 1 which I will discuss later), Responsiveness of the Device and Apps and finally the Voice Recognition and Alexa Integration.  I have decided to replace my other devices, Except for the NVIDIA Shield (which I will be keeping because it is still amazing!), with either the Fire TV 4K stick or the Fire TV 4k Cube (so I can have a little onboard Storage space).Now for my Only Problem with this Product, the Fact that the Fire TV does NOT provide the Vudu App.  Personally we have been purchasing and using the Vudu App since it debuted almost 10 years ago.  There is a Workaround, so that you can get Vudu to work on the Fire TV, but requires some technical knowledge and enabling other App Sources on the Device.  We purchase All of our Movies on Vudu and use it to store All of the 100's of Movies we've accumulated over the years (nearly 300 so far).  I'm assuming this is because the Amazon Prime App directly competes with Vudu for your Movie Streaming business. However, that doesn't mean that Amazon shouldn't provide support for the Vudu app.  I know this is a minor item, and it really doesn't sway me from replacing my other devices with the Fire TV devices, but wanted to make sure that I made others aware, just in case you use the Vudu App.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,1,0
"I'm that I replaced the Fire TV with this new Fire TV Stick 4k. I didn't really need to upgrade because the pendant Fire TV i had been using worked flawlessly, it had 4k and HDR (High Dynamic Range).

I also have a Fire TV Recast and it automatically integrated once powered on.The new Fire TV Stick works just like the Fire TV but can handle Dolby Vision HDR.

Amazon always wants to control every aspect of it's products functions... like making you watch Amazon commercials before Amazon Prime programs, you can skip these commercials with Roku. You cannot watch the pre-recorded programs on the Fire Stick/Recast when the internet is down... why not?  Everything you need to watch is in your house, the recordings are on your in-house bought and paid for Recast DVR hard drive, you can address the shows without internet, but Amazon will not let them play... why?  It seems Amazon does not care about problems regarding the electronic gear it produces.  Amazon produces it and then says take it or leave it, not caring about the investment the consumer has made in Amazon.  We cannot leave it after we already gave you our money, we are stuck with whatever problem arises.  When there is a flaw in the development and function of a device, it seems there is no effort to correct it... the answer to the consumer is that they will forward it to the developers.... Yeah, right!  Nothing ever changes or gets corrected and we never hear anything back.  I went through this with the Amazon Fire Phone (two of them) in which Amazon just dumped us all and pulled support... and now with the Fire Stick and Recast DVR.... problems Amazon will not fix or address.... they told me that's the way it is designed and you have to live with the problems or quit using it.

"When can I expect a firmware (bluetooth specifically) update to this device so that my OG PS4 controllers and 8BitDo controllers work? I ordered new 8BitDo controllers specifically to use with RetroArch on my 2nd Gen Fire TV Stick 4K with my brand new 4K TV, and they don't work. They pair successfully, but none of the inputs register. So I figured I'd try my OG PS4 controllers, and they pair as well....but again, no inputs register. WTF, Amazon?!? I have over $160 of bluetooth controllers that pair with my Nintendo Switch, and my old Android TV without issue. But my brand new Fire TV Stick 4K? Nope.Now from what I've read, you (Amazon) silently removed support of your own Amazon branded game controller from the Fire TV Stick 4K through an update, and that is probably the reason for the issue with the other controllers. So really, it should be an easy fix for you. This thing is EASILY 5 stars with that part working correctly. It's fast, I can watch all of the content I'm interested in, and it's very discreet...no big box to plug in, etc. But without being able to use my wireless bluetooth controllers? 2 stars.",2,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0

"I purchased this Amazon 4k stick as a test. I wanted to connect it directly to my AV receiver and see if the sound quality is better than my currently connected Echo Dot (connected via 3.5 aux). Without question, in a side-by-side comparison switching inputs back and forth from Echo Dot to Fire Stick, streaming hi-fi quality music via Tidal, the Fire Stick sounds much, much better. I had to do the initial setup on a TV before moving it to my receiver (this receiver is in my office and is not connected to any visual display as I use it for audio only).End result, I'm very pleased that I was able to get even higher audio quality in my office, but this really highlights a gap in products from Amazon. I'm disappointed that I can't get the same quality out of an Echo dot (intended for audio-only) that I can get out of a Fire Stick (which is not intended for audio-only). Not everyone wants to purchase an Echo Studio. This doesn't address the need for those of us who have invested a lot into our audio systems and just want to add the convenience of Alexa without deteriorating quality in-between by using an Echo Dot.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

I hate the Samsung remote for navigating Netflix and Prime. The buttons are too teeny and good luck messing with the Samsung remote in the dark.

I had applied an Amazon coupon for 1 of them and placed my order yesterday, then when I looked at the confirmation email today I saw the coupon code was no longer applied. I cancelled my order and will find something else. Or will buy from another retailer when I can find it on sale. I'm furious, that you would change the price after purchase! That's disgusting behavior for any retailer, and I will be reporting this to the Attorney General! I buy from you every day, and was ever considering being a seller, but this is abhorrent practice to do something so underhanded. If it's not illegal, it's unethical!

So far he is very happy with it and loves he can get local news and record his fav shows, I finally found THAT was one of his biggest issues.I had hoped the Alexa integration would be the final piece of the pie to get him to agree to cut the cord (he is one of Alexa's biggest fans!) but I can't get the integration to work.

"Keeps hanging up on buffering. I can watch the exact same streaming programs on my laptop or via an old Roku box compared to the firestick 4K. There is nothing that I watch that requires a 4K connection and all I get is streaming service notifications that there are problems with the download and then the program shuts down and quits. I've talked to tech support. My speed tests run in the 15-16 average and this is perfectly fine to stream via my laptop, which I connect to my TV with an HDMI cable. Never a problem. Not once. I'm not willing to pay double per month to up my download speed. So I'm going to return the stick (if I can) and use my laptop for streaming or get a Roku box again, but beware that the 4K stick automatically converts all downloads to 4k ""quality"" (I never had a quality problem before) and will require more bandwidth than you might have a with a standard wifi service (I have AT&T).

It also does a setup for having the remote control the TV and the receiver (my Fire Stick is plugged into my AV receiver). It works great -- I can power on/off both the TV (Samsung) and receiver (Onkyo) by just pressing the power button on the Fire remote. During power-up it also sets the receiver to the correct port for using the Fire stick. The volume on the remote controls the volume on the receiver.

However, I'm not sure if it's the app or the device but sometimes a video won't load and i will have to unplug the fire stick for it to work again.

When I told him I had it plugged into the HDMI port on my Dell Computer monitor, he said no, it must be (and quoted the requirements) a ""-TV- with HDMI inputs"" and insisted using a computer monitor would either not work at or would be intermittent at best.  This is a 4K 27"" Dell, about a year old, that I previously had an Apple TV plugged in.  I decided it wasn't worth arguing and said process me a refund then.

Even so, the Firesticks are working tremendously well. I have two TVs (about 10 and 12 years old); one laptop (about four years old) and a state of the art desktop, about one year old. I'm definitely not an expert, but it seems like quite a bit of power would be needed. The firesticks (one for a bedroom TV; one for a living room TV) do a superb  job. The bedroom TV is seldom on, but the living room TV, the desktop and the laptop are usually all running all day, every day. Everything is working so well I can hardly believe it.

"So as a tech guy I look at specs, reviews, the usual... I have 1 of each gen fire stick. The 4k is the 3rd gen and interestingly enough the highest spec, but the worst functionality. It is much slower than the previous gens and more often than not it will require a reboot after a few hours. Also the wifi ability to connect to 5ghz networks which is a known issue in the previous gens of just not working on a 5ghz band is still persistent in this gen... I can like previous gen connect to a 5ghz network, but thats it, it just gives network error. After the years of using fire tv and just recently coming across a family member who has a newer roku, I have now made up my mind to go roku. It is faster in a sense that is jaw dropping compared to fire tv stick. I feel like an idiot for using a fire tv stick for so long. There are no ads unlike the fire stick... i have never shopped from the fire stick and if that is the reason for your purchase, i cannot comment on it. for a streaming device, roku has amazon video and most (indeed just most, not all) of other normal apps, like hbo go, netflix, etc.....",1,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

If cheaper at that time I will definitely buy 2 more.I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this remote control makes it the only necessary gadget to use for your home theater as long as you’ve already switched to the video and audio selections. I have a 2008 Samsung DLP, a cable dvr and a 2018 Sony receiver on a tv table stand in a corner of the family room. My 2006 Onkyo receiver wasn’t worth repairing.

I don't have that many apps but if I wanted to add any I would need to remove some first. My old stick kept messing up and getting slower....constantly causing me to clear caches and do restarts {sigh}.... hence the reason I looked into this one @ 8GB.But installing it yesterday I see it has only 5.68 GB as well, plus the added frustration of re-downloading all my fav apps and signing back in or re-activating....",2,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0

You do have to hold down a button when speaking to search. And a fun accident I had was when my echo dot heard my firestick Alexa and searched for what firestick said. Good times. You can also click a button and what's on your phone plays on tv. Without setting anything up. It just does it. So freaking awesome. As far as 4K, no idea if it does that on my not smart TV. Don't really care. Power on/off, volume, and voice search has me in love with this item. And it's not expensive. Really love it. Really great for Amazon prime/Kindle/whatever members.

HBO is even retiring its app from Fire TV, so you will have to go through Prime Video to watch anything on HBO after July. No thanks.I’m sure there are lots of corporate finger-pointing reasons for this, but the bottom line is the same: two of the biggest and most popular streaming services are not available on Fire TV.

You can place your Amazon order, set reminders or alarms, listen to your favorite streaming music or pod cast, play games, view family photos, and much more.  It's amazing that all this is possible in a tiny device, about the size of a harmonica.  Actually, it Amazon!All that praise aside, one slight request would be to improve the screen saver.  While there are some very cool pictures - you can even customize them with your own - I would also like to have an option like the Apple TV.  Apple's device displays absolutely breath-taking videos for its screen saver.  Amazon could take it 1 step further, by streaming continuous screen saver videos directly from the internet - as opposed to built-in screen savers.  Apple's videos are beautiful, but they're short, and eventually they just stop.  It would be nice to have continuous (looping or infinite) streaming screen savers, essentially doubling as motion video wall art.  Just an idea...",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0

I immediately purchased a new large home router, added a network extender, tried both 2G and 5G networks (5G is recommended by Amazon for this problem, but the result is worse), and tried to calm my wife's frustration with them. The home screen is way too busy for our desired use-we only need and want the apps we use to be on the home screen and not be cluttered up with everything . We don't want the Amazon Photos app, but you can not uninstall it. We don't want the Amazon Freetime app because it is way too restrictive for our family use (tried it on our great grandkids Fire HD tablets) and have uninstalled it many, many times, but it always reappears again. We should have total control over what apps we want on our purchases-not Amazon! Amazon apparently just updated , 11/1/2019, one of my fire sticks and added a ""News"" app which is mostly their founders liberal ideology sources.

This though, it works great, has no slowdown, supports dolby so i always get great sound and has great picture quality. There are a few things keeping me from rating 5 stars... I'm still not all for their UI layout. Its over commercialize and far less customizable than an Apple TV or a Roku. Alexa functionality is better but because it can control devices how I use my harmony with voice control has changed a bit since now my alexa is trying to make the fire tv 4k control things as if it was a cube (you need to turn on device control to utilize volume on the fire tv remote otherwise id turn it off).

It is particularly annoying when I'm watching a series, so I can't just pick up there, which should be so simple. I have to go searching for whatever I was watching in the search area.On top of it, Amazon seems to have slowed down the old stick to force me to buy the new one. I already bought one. My previous to one got so slow it was unbearable and became completely inoperable... coincidentally at the time they came out with their new one.

As far as Kodi, i’m not so sure. Ive done a lot of research and downloaded a lot of add ons but I’m not have very good luck. I can’t get the movies to play right or at all, I know my wifi isn’t the fastest but I don’t have any issues with my other streaming apps. All in all this is a GREAT alternative to the chromecast (which doesn’t have a remote) and I would say EQUALLY as good as Roku.

"I have had many firesticks and really liked them all and the 4k one with the power button and volume control was icing on the cake.  I bought this one in November of 18 and its only lasted till now and is starting to have issues.  The major issue we are having is there no sound after 20 seconds of the firestick being woken up from sleep.  This has been happening a lot and the only way to fix it is to restart the firestick.  I did try doing a master clear and starting over but the issue is still happens.  I thought I would try a warranty repair as it seems defective (never had this problem with any other generation of firestick) but the warranty is only 90 days.While I do like the firestick, I have noticed that other older firesticks keep locking up because of the home page trying to auto run videos and ads.  Really wish there was a way to disable this as it really slows down the firestick down.  So in the end I'm giving up on the firestick right now and will try my luck with a Roku.  I had one years ago (still working) and there device home page is just the apps you have without any adds or prime video trying to play.",2,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"The Firestick was easy to install and, as advertised, I could use it to watch the free Amazon Prime videos included in my Prime membership.  Sharp ""smart""  TV did not have a Prime Video app and received notification from Amazon that the app on my Panasonic sound system/home theater would not be supported after October 2019. I had been using the Panasonic system with the Sharp TV to watch free Prime Video  shows such as NYPD Blue .  So far, it has functioned as advertised.",4,1,2019-8-18,1,2,0
"I love my old Firestick so when the Roku we got for Christmas would only work if you had internet, we didn't think twice about getting the new Firestick for another TV.  Well, what we didn't realize is that the old Firestick worked because we had internet when we started using it. Like Roku, it doesn't work unless you have internet.  Our internet died a month ago (was a router and card) and we have limited other choices where we live. Phone companies are no longer selling equipment for/support the type of system we used, cable isn't available here and the 2 satellite companies in our area both have high prices with low GB for data.  So when someone told us to just screencast everything we tried it with the old Firestick. It works with other streaming, but not with Amazon streaming even with setting the phone at the highest data-stream settings. We ordered a new router and hopefully it will work long enough to get the new Firestick working.",3,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Good price if you can get it on sale and very good device for streaming media. Wifi is good enough for HD stream, not sure about 4K quality since i dont have one of those 4K TV to test out. Alot of free content online like youtube or plutotv. The new remote is good since you have have volume/mute/power button without using another remote to control the TV. Just wish they got a querty keyboard built-in also so i can type quicker like when using the web browser. As far as the Main interface, it could use an improvement, it doesn't allow you to remove the sections you are not interested in, maybe they will update with options to remove it in the future. Overall is still a good low cost device that can do alot",5,1,2019-9-9,1,1,0
"UPDATED 2020-01-25:Someone on AVS forum posted a solution to the long-standing video freezing issue with the Fire TV Stick 4K and certain channels like ESPN using the AT&T TV Now (formerly DirecTV Now) app.  Go to the Fire TV's settings, then display and audio, then surround sound, and select ""best available.""  This fixed it for me.  If you're still experiencing video freezing with AT&T TV with ""best available"" audio selected, then you have a different issue unrelated to this bug.",4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
"Overall, this is a great product for streaming.  It's easy to set up and use.  The picture quality is excellent and it has most of the apps I use.  As of the beginning of July, 2020, it doesn't have HBO Max.  My biggest knock on the product though is that it has very limited memory.  You can only add 6 or 7 apps (like Netflix) before it maxes out.  You can't delete the built in Amazon apps you don't use either.  You can add an OTG adapter to add extra memory but you have to jump through hoops to configure it.  It would have been easy for Amazon to add an extra USB port of an SD card slot but they didn't.",3,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"I received this sometime in June and by August 1st it has stopped working. Luckily they are exchanging the stick itself, but not the power cord or the remote. I understand that it's not likely the remote given it will still work on my TV's power and volume, but will be super irritated if the power cord is the problem and I'm forced to exchange that, as well.A couple things... The new remotes do have a power button and volume control for your TV. Those features are handy and should have been on the original model. I find absolutely no difference in performance between my 4K stick and the original fire sticks to warrant the increase in price, however. If it turns out I received a lemon and the new 4K stick does work better, I will update my review accordingly.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"The Firestick packs a heavy punch for an excellent price with its processing speed, voice recognition, and remote functions. With that being said, I love Hulu and for whatever reason, the Firestick and Hulu app do not mesh. I’m now on my second Firestick with the same problem...Hulu constantly fails to load, requiring me to restart my Firestick multiple times per day to get Hulu to work. I never had this issue with my Roku, which tells me it’s an issue with the Firestick platform. It’s a huge pain to constantly have to do this, and neither Hulu nor Amazon appear to have an effective solution.",1,1,2019-10-11,1,1,0
"First off, let me state that we JUST 'cut the cable'  BYE-BYE! C-ya! I did a lot of research prior to the 'cut' and I'm glad I did!  We looked at Roku, SlingTV and a host of others.  Final choices were OTA RCA HD Platinum antenna, Comcast Internet (only) anf Amazon's 4k Firestick with optional Ethernet adapter.  The picture quality looks AMAZING, the interface is a little busy, but manageable and the features...are countless.  I decided on the optional Ethernet adapter and very glad I did... no buffering, GREAT image quality across the board and no letdowns, whatsoever.  If you have an Amazon Prime account, good internet speeds and want to save money?  Why not?  Remote works well, can synch all your devices for operation and built in Alexa 'on demand' is great.  There is a microphone button ON the remote to 'use' Alexa...which is all I want or need.  I don't utilize that feature as much as some because I'm still capable of doing things on my own, thank-you.  Overall, I'm very happy with the purchases and functionality thus far!",5,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"I don't like the fact that almost on a daily basis I need to unplug the thing to reset it. I like to sleep with the tv on, and it won't let me. After a couple hours it asks if you are still watching. If you don't reply, you don't get tv, but the tv remains on, but blank. Pain in the butt to download apps. For many apps it requires you to go online, get a code, enter it, sign in with your internet provider (which takes a few minutes), go back to ""Home"", find your channel and most times it works. Tends to lose internet connection alot, even though when I go to settings it shows my connection is very good. This happens several times daily. I have a wifi booster and signal is excellent throughout my house. I'd only purchase this when on sale, otherwise it's not worth the hassle of all the interruptions in service and missing live shows. For some reason NBC is the worst, followed closely by ABC. Constant, consistent issues with those two.",3,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"Initially I was looking for a replacement to my Samsung smart TV controller. But because I loved the small size of the remote I couldn't get used to those huge universal remotes. Eventually I decided to buy this to essentially replace all the smart functions my smart TV did like YouTube, Netflix, Pandora, etc. I still needed to be able to access settings like picture settings and sleep timer and things like that so I also ordered the sofabaton and I use that to program the few buttons that still barely work on my original remote. I ended up having to use my friends old Samsung tablet with an IR blaster to program the other buttons that didn't work anymore on my remote. I don't watch TV much so that portion was never a problem but the sofabaton had enough buttons to add for that.Ultimately with both devices connected it ends up becoming a long remote. But seeing as how I rarely use my TV. It's not really a problem not having them connected and even when they, the slimness of the fire TV remote is nice and small. Features work well. Alexa hears me clearly without issues. And everything works flawlessly...so far at least.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"While the Nvidia Shield TV is hands-down the most capable and versatile streaming device I have ever owned, this is a VERY close second.  I have owned almost every streaming device you can imagine: Apple TVs, Rokus, past-gen FireSticks, and Chromecasts.  Having said that, you couldn't do much better for driving a secondary TV in your home.  If access to content is your goal, this does almost everything (absence of YouTube TV and Google Play Movies being two possible deal breakers).  The interface is snappy and the hassle-free setup is a dream.  The biggest standout feature, in my opinion, is the ease with which the remote can be configured to control your home entertainment setup.  I purchased this with a refurbished Vizio TV and refurbished Vizio sound bar.  The process for setting this up as a universal remote was so intuitive and painless that I consider it the best feature of the device.  I use only this remote to control my entire home entertainment setup.  The price can't be beat; and when weighing this against the king (Shield TV), it's a decision to spend less than $50 for almost everything, or north of $150 for absolutely everything.  This is the best purchase I've made this year.",5,1,2019-9-24,1,1,0
Amazon has outdone themselves with the Firestick 4k. Adding TV controls to the remote and turbo charging the processing power while maintaining a price point under $50 they have hit a home run. I have been using the Second Gen Fire TV boxes in my house since they came out and up until the Firestick 4k haven't seen any product that warranted me to upgrade. Now I have been slowly upgrading my Fire TV's to the new Firestick 4k because it's processing power is on par to the 2nd Gen Fire TV but the added TV controls is a game changer. The only way that they could top this is if they allowed you to expand the Firesticks memory via MicroSD like the Fire TV allows you to do. Overall im very happy with the product.,5,1,2019-4-24,1,1,0
It's a nice addition to 4k tv.  It is better than the built in smart tv option built into the tv.  Samsung UHD I think runs on Tizen and it's rather buggy.  My Samsung UHD remote was on it's last leg and directional buttons were not working well so I was looking for replacement remotes which all turned out to be more expensive than the Fire Stick 4k so that made my decision easy.  The Fire stick remote is nice and simple and looks to be well made.  I had the 1st gen stick for my 1080 tv which is still in use but I also just bought another 1080 HD 2nd gen stick to have the upgraded remote.,5,1,2019-9-24,1,1,0
"This is probably the best upgrade the firestick has had so far.  I have bought several fire sticks, then the fire tv, this one is far better than all of them.  It is fast and there is no waiting to load anymore. We don't have cable anymore and this was the turning point for us. This firestick also alleviates the need for any other remote because it has a volume control and an on off button. Of course it is equipted with alexa which has been a go to for me over the last few years. I love the ease of use, automatic set up and overall quality of this device.  The only reason I don't change them all is because I know in time this will be upgraded and when it is I will purchase an upgrade for my original firestick that doesn't have voice control. I love Amazon because the guide is easy to follow and it is great to have all my apps in one place.",5,1,2018-11-25,1,1,0
"For over a year I've had issues with my Firestick 4K not loading some apps. Usually I could get around the issue by repeatedly launching the app until it would work. Occasionally this doesn't work after 10+ attempts and I just give up. I contacted Amazon support today and because my device is older than a 1 year, it's out of warranty and Amazon does not care that their product is buggy. Sure I could have contacted support sooner, but relaunching the apps multiple times seemed like the easier option. Conversing with Amazon support today for over a hour accomplished nothing afterallI'm an IT professional and Audio-Video pro, and I tried all troubleshooting procedures. It's very frustrating to do a factory reset, download all apps and get them logged in again to find the issue isn't fixed!",1,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"Prior to purchasing this Fire TV 4K stick, I have 3 separate remotes; Insignia TV, Samsung soundbar, and a Fire TV stick 2nd gen. I must use all 3 to use the tv for Hulu/Netflix.

Mind you, my soundbar is connected to TV via optical cable, not HDMI-CEC. It's magic!",5,1,2019-10-4,1,2,0
I wanted the new 4K version of Firestick for the improved wifi and overall performance - but I also wanted it for the newer remote.

"I don't pay for over a 1000 channels. 900 of which I would never use. I do use an rabbit ears and Netflix and Amazon Prime. This Fire stick has helped me get more out of my smart tv that recently stopped being so smart. I can use the tv for my antennae, but can't get online with it anymore. I do like how quickly the Fire stick operates and how easy it is to use by just speaking what you want to watch. I wouldn't mind it if you didn't have to push the ""Talk"" button on the remote to tell the Fire stick what you want, but that is a very tiny con. Most of the time, the things have been watching are at organized at the top of the menu anyways.",5,1,2019-6-2,1,1,0
"I  had previously used Roku  but I bought a new Oled TV and am moving my old plasma into another room with the Roku 3 I have hooked up to it. Since I have an amazon environment in my house ( show, dots, spot, etc)  I thought this would be a great addition. I bought this along with the Roku Ultra on Black Friday and thought I would move to the Amazon fire stick but wasn't sure. I will say setup was very simple.  I really liked the fact it could control just about everything via voice, cable box, sound bar, access the internet, turn on and off my smart light switches, etc. Well it is good for that but where it is truly lacking is the interface and the apps. The interface (what you see when you turn on the thing) pushes you to amazon first, nothing wrong with that but you have to go through various menus (not with your voice) to get out of the Amazon pushed items. I played around in it and tried to find one of my favorite Roku channels, C/net. It give me tech news, car reviews, etc. Well I couldn't find it anywhere and when I started to use the voice function to find it the results were not what I wanted, OK one app  they dont have. I tried another app I liked- a news station from my old home town, again nothing. With the firestick you really have to know what app you are searching for if you want to find it by voice and I just didn't see a lot of apps on this even though they say there are thousands. It may offer Dolby vision and is cool that it can control all your devices eliminating the need for a bunch of remotes however for me it just doesn't  have the apps I want. I know they may add them later-maybe- but Roku has them now and as I said the navigation is a pain. So my decision is made. Keep the Roku and return the firestick.",3,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
I love all amazon related electronics! The fire stick is amazing. I recently cut off my cable and strictly use wifi. This allows me to still watch my favorite shows and without the high price of cable. I got the regular fire stick for my two other bedrooms but decided to give the 4K streaming one a try to my living room tv. I’m so impressed. The screen is so clear and bright. It’s almost like I upgraded my tv because the picture quality is so much better. It was so nice that amazon already had it set up to link to my account. All I had to do was plug it up and log in my Amazon account and It was ready to start watching. I would highly recommend getting the fire stick and upgrading to 4K.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
"My third gen Firestick, each generation has improved the user experience big time. So far used Netflix and plex.

Ya, sorry, it matters.",5,1,2018-11-28,1,1,0
This is a clear improvement over the earlier remote without voice control nor volume and power control. I am using this with the fire Recast box and a 7-speaker amplifier. With this combo I can operate my home theater system in streaming and broadcast TV modes with this one remote. The complex menus in today's streaming interfaces can be a pain to navigate. Adding the Recast function only made it worse. The voice control cuts through the menus and gets me to where I want to be much more easily. I still use the 5-way navigator but only to fine tune my selections when needed.,5,1,2019-10-30,1,1,0
"OK, this is the most TERRIBLE remote to try and open!!  There is a depressed area on the back, which you would think  makes the back slide open (to insert batteries), but the damn thing does NOT SLIDE!!  I ended up having to pry it open with a nail file and wasn't sure if the darn thing would break or not.  THIS IS VERY USER-UNFRIENDLY and Amazon or their manufacturer should be ashamed of themselves for selling this product!  I'm a long time Amazon customer, and this is the WORST product I have have ever bought, simply because of the inability to open the back so that you can insert the batteries.  I mean, come on, Amazon.  This is your Firestick and there is a MAJOR DEFECT with simply opening the battery access.  Booo!  Hiss !!",2,1,2019-1-3,1,1,0

And adjusting your mindset to think of content not by station number, but by subject and proper name.

So now I needed another Fire TV Stick for my main TV which does have internet and apps, and access to Hulu, but it wasn't the same, and confused my husband. This Fire TV Stick is an improvement over the first one I got, it now has off/on for the TV and volume control, we don't need any other remote control for our main TV.

"Don’t buy this. Amazon goes out of its way to keep you from watching anything.if you use a vpn. I have ExpressVPN, which is one of the better ones out there, and in fact Amazon sells them on their site. And yet, when I use the VPN, and then disconnect from it to watch prime videos, Amazon punishes me with a firestick that stops working. It gets stuck on connecting to network, even though my router shows that it is connected, and the only solution is to reset the device to factory defaults. So far this has happened to me twice, and each time you lose all your add-ons, all your personalization, and you have to start from scratch. I am disgusted by Amazon’s handling of this. And if you want to get customer support, guess what, you cannot email them. Unfortunately for me and some other people, using a phone or using chat is extremely difficult. Therefore as far as I’m concerned customer support services doesn’t even exist.

"Overall, this is a huge improvement over the old Firestick I had which had become very problematic. With the older version,  everything loaded very slowly, and almost nothing played smoothly, and sometimes skipped and stopped. I was thinking the problem might be inadequate bandwidth in my internet connection, but I was getting occasional onscreen warnings that the ""firestick was running very hot"" , so I decided to upgrade to Firestick HD. WOW. what a difference. Setup was fairly straight forward, though I had to sign in and re-register some of my premium apps like Netflix, HBO Go and Showtime Anytime, overall, just a slight inconvenience. The Firestick HD loads almost instantly and the apps load and run very smoothly and clearly. There is an issue that has me a bit curious however. I use a Bose quiet comfort headset to keep from disturbing my condo neighbors when I want to crank the volume on movies. Lately, and it seems to coincide with using the new Firestick HD, I am noticing some muddiness and slight sound distortion in the low register sound range that was never an issue before. Is anyone else using Bose, or similar headsets through a remote Bluetooth connection and noticing any issues with the new Firestick? Anyway, I'm extremely happy with the overall performance, and highly recommend that anyone who is using the old Firestick version upgrade to HD, it is well worth the price. I have an older Samsung HD television, that doesn't have a smart hub, so the Firestick is a must for premium access.",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0

We decided to give up cable because well the price kept going up. We boosted our internet and since we have lots of streaming services we decided to either get a new tv (my husband’s idea) or buy a fire stick to try out. Well I scored a great Black Friday deal so I win! Ha! In your face husband! Alexa works great with the remote. My 6 year old can use it properly. The picture is enhanced and looks incredible. It basically made our tv look better like it went super saiyan. I’m able to watch animé with my son on it. The definition looks great! My husband has no complaints because we saved so much money. His football looks great too which is why he wanted a new tv, for football of course. I would recommend this product for people who are streaming. We are able to watch Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon tv, listen to Amazon music, watch Cartoon Network and ESPN+ all on the same device. I’m now interested in purchasing an echo dot for our living room and our daughter because if she asks Alexa about Frozen 2 one more time, I honestly don’t know if I can handle it even though the soundtrack is super catchy. ; )",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

"For the $, this is a great media streamer.  Offers 4k, HDR, Dolby Vision, and quality sound.  Picture quality in Amazon Prime and Netflix is very good.  Sharp and colorful.  While there are a good amount of apps (Netflix, YouTube, HBO, Crackle, etc), I feel they missed a couple big ones.  When I first installed it, there were no Movies Anywhere or VUDU apps.  I was considering returnng the Stick, as I have lot of movies on those apps and was looking forward to having them available to watch.  A few days later, the Movies Anywhere app was available for download, which was a very pleasant surprise.  No VUDU app still, but most movies cross over to Movies Anywhere, but still think VUDU should be in the app selection for those without a Movies Anywhere account.  Seems a big miss by Amazon.  Also the silly fight between Amazon and Google, means no Google Play app, which is just stupid on both parties.  Amazon Music is available and pretty good, even without the Premiere music membership.  It does tend to push Amazon Prime more than I'd like, but I expected that.  The only media streamer available that can compete with this, and offer Dolby Vision, might be the newest Apple 4K TV streamer, but that is almost 4 times the price.  Typical Apple ripping off their customers, yet people keep paying their outrageous prices.  Ok, back to the Amazon Stick 4K. Amazon has created a good product here, especially given the low price.  Happy with purchase.  Wish it did come with a network cable adapter.  You have to buy that separately.",4,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0

But so far so good. Some quick overview of what I like and don’t like so far just from yesterday’s experience.,5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
UPDATE: 6/26/19Having lived with the firestick for a time now I still think it is the best of the bunch especially if you have prime. What I do not like is the fact that if you can not aquire a wifi connection it is literally useless. You will only get the settings screen. No home screen or any apps just settings until you get a wifi connection. Even Ifvyou have games or in My case external storage connected that does not require wifi to function. I am in a situation that my wifi flakes out now and then and when this happens the stick becomes completely useless. I really like the firestick but this is so rediculous that you can not even get to a home screen. Extremely irritating to not be able to at least get to the home screen so I can access games and other storage. No good reason for this design. No wifi say so but let me get a home screen.,4,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
"I really wish someday that Amazon will bring to market a streaming device that doesn't have these audio and playback issues. This is the second AFTV4K that has random audio dropouts and it also has trouble maintaining a 24Hz playback cadence, it will eventually lose sync and start skipping frames; totally unacceptable and completely preventable with proper developers at the helm.The alternative, of course, would be for Amazon not to cripple their Prime Video app on other devices such as the Apple TV 4K(very little 5.1 DD+ support), that sort of corporate appendage measuring might make the people in the corner offices happy but all it does it hurt Amazon customers trying to use Amazon apps.",2,1,2018-12-1,1,1,0
I love this new remote that came with this 4K stick. The power button and volume buttons mean I never have to use my separate (also tiny) TV remote that is lost constantly. Now I just keep up with this one and don't have to use the TV remote. Alexa voice can also switch to cable or HDMI and even my 7 yr old can switch to HDMI easily to play xbox. I am thrilled. The quality is also apparent since I can now stream 4K on my 4K TV.  I had the Fire TV one before and the regular voice remote. I switched these out and got rid of the 1st gen Fire stick and original 3 in super small remote that was in my daughters room. So glad they made these bigger.  I have casebot brightly colored silicone cases on all of ours now and we rarely lose them. As always the Fire stick is awesome. We subscribe to Hulu and Netflix and Starz and also have Kodi on it. Cable isn't needed with those. Saves a ton of money. I have put everyone I know on to these when they 1st came out. My favorite thing about them is that I can pack one for vacation and easily plug it in in 2 minutes and the kids can watch whatever they want.,5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"I upgraded from the first generation Fire stick (which was still functioning!!) to get the new one to improve the quality of the picture. I always could tell I was using a streaming device rather than watching live TV with our old Fire Stick, and it made a noticeable difference with the upgraded Fire Stick. I am so glad that we finally did it and upgraded. We also like the voice commands, though we haven't experimented a whole lot. One of our favorite things is that it has made our TV remote somewhat obsolete! No more multiple remotes. We can control our volume and turning our TV on and off with the FireTV remote.",5,1,2019-7-11,1,1,0
"I mulled over upgrading to the FireTv 4k Stick from my original FireTv 2014 ""box"" for too long. The myriad of reviews and discussion online over-simplified the decision by only looking at paper specs of hardware ""speed"". What they failed to account for is that this FireTv 4K stick is a newer version of Android and includes an updated remote. As soon as I set it up, I noticed I was now running newer versions of apps such as Pluto, which the developers had stopped updating for older versions of FireTv/Android. The updated OS and hardware have one wonders to remove any jitter or glitches from the user interface animations. Additionally, the improvement to the video hardware show improved color range on my Netflix streaming, this alone makes my 12 year old TV feel new again. To top it all off, the new remote is very effective, best in class. It was able to automatically detect my TV (unlike ""universal remotes"" of the past), and control Power/Volume and select inputs via Alexa. I don't say this often, but this product is a real winner, especially at the price point!",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"This is the perfect device if you enjoy watching the boot screen loop over and over. Amazon has had a known issue with these devices getting stuck in a boot loop and they offer nothing serious to prevent it from happening. Streaming content can, and eventually will, cut out while you are watching, and the fire stick will restart, over and over. I can't fathom why this happens. I have a generation one Chromecast that still to this day functions flawlessly. I don't understand how a company as large and wealthy as Amazon just sends out products like this. Seriously, this thing was great for about a month. One year in and it might as well be used as a door jam.Edit: I just this POS flying down the street, giving it the funeral it deserves. Honestly, this is by far the worst streaming product ever created by human hands. My crappy 1st generation Chromecast out performs this thing, even after 6 years.",1,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"I got the 4K fire stick to replace an older model Roku. It looks a lot nicer to not have the corded Roku unit plus the fire stick will be handy for travel. One thing I really like about the 4K fire stick is that when I press power on its remote, the TV and sound bar both come on too. Only one remote needed! Initial setup was very easy and there were lots of additional options in the menu to fine tune the setup as needed. The only issue I had is that even though my Internet signal was 20-25Mbps where the fire stick is, sometime when streaming movies it would stop streaming and go to a white grainy screen - not the buffering screen, it was like it lost connection entirely. I had to restart the fire stick to resume. I purchased a $40 wireless extender for the room and have not had the problem since. The fire stick is a couple rooms away from my router so there may have been some interference with the signal. Overall I am very pleased with the fire stick. It is very fast and has very good picture quality.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"This was really a simple device to install on my two televisions. I was able to immediately see what was available and the interface is very easy to add other channels you want whether for free or for a fee. I have 2 televisions of varying ages and capacities and the Firestick just makes viewing them better. The visual quality is really good. Once in awhile there is buffering (with very recent movies) but I suspect when I change to a different internet provider that may diminish. My plat thus far was to cut the cord to a cable provider and step one has been achieved. My next step is get a different internet provider that offers (and guarantees)  more speed and reliability and that is in the works. Buying the Firestick on sale was an unexpected bonus and savings. Now that I have cut the cable cord, I will save even more money and be happier to see what I pick and choose and not pay for things that do not interest me.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"This is my second firestick, added for a second tv. What an improvement! The 4k offers a clear hd stream with crisp color & definition, even in dark scenes.I’m less impressed with the voice control, as it generally doesn’t seem to give me what i ask for, but since my response has been to skip using it, the fault may be mine, as i may not be giving it enough time to learn my voice.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
"I have been uses Roku device for years, since their first version and they have been getting better every year.  I now have four of them.  When I bought a ""Smart"" TV I found the menu to be convoluted, complex and difficult to use.  Additionally I could not get the channels that I was getting with Roku so I added yet another Roku streaming stick.I decided I wanted to add ""JackBox"" to my channels... Oh Oh... it doesn't work with Roku...  :o(",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"Very impressed from the get go. Packaging is Very well designed and is of great quality, you can feel like you are opening a well though-through item. Set up was very easy and flawless (if you purchase this through your account on Amazon the stick comes already registered to you, and I found that to be very convenient). It recognizes your TV and other controllable devices on your Wi-Fi in under a second. Streaming speed and quality is fantastic. If you wonder why I gave it 4 stars...my annoyance is quite simple yet has a a lot of value to me. No sleep timer so if you are falling asleep watching something not so interesting you have to rouse yourself and turn it off yourself, or sleep with it on. Overall convenient, good quality product.",4,1,2019-5-19,1,1,0
"I really love my fire stick. It was very easy to set up and has an intuitive OS. The voice feature on the remote is great. I have also downloaded the Amazon Photo's App and use it to select and save pictures for my screen saver. I am using the fire stick on a projector and was easy, works beautifully. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it should have a much netter integration with cable companies like Infinity. I have to pay Amazon for services that I already have e.g Starz, Epix. In some instances where I can log in e.g. NBC, ABC, i have to create a different log in which i find to be unnecessary and a waste of time. I am enjoying my Fire Stick but these simple things would make it a 5 star product.",4,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0
"I ordered the regular fire stick first about a month or two ago.  Too slow!  Got too hot!  This 4K stick is mindblowing compared to the old slow one.  I won't have any heat issues with this one like I did the other one.  I got a 4 port and ethernet connection, 40 mm fan, and aluminum heat sink strips that I put to my 4K stick.  It stays nice and cool now!  Amazon, I just cured the heating issues for your firestick.  I got the pattern.  You can''t have it!",5,1,2019-10-16,1,2,0
"This new Fire Tv Stick 4K is awesome. Setup was easy and picture looks great on my 4K TV. Lots of new video and audio settings to use versus the previous Fire TV Stick. Every app plays videos perfectly, in great quality, and loads faster than previous Fire TV Stick.  Some people have said they have issues with DirecTV NOW but I have not experienced any issues. It lodas faster on this device than previous models and picture is great, no buffering, no issues whatsoever. The Fire Stick menu pages even load faster. This thing is amazing. I am using the ethernet adapter but tried it with wifi as well and both connections work flawlessly. Only thing that kind of bothered me was Amazon has the HDR set to be always on by default which does not make a lot of sense. I set mine to adaptive and even tested on one of the 4K HDR movies on Prime and as soon as the movie loaded it turned on HDR and when I exited it turned it back off like it should. The route is a huge plus as well being able to turn on and off the tv and control the volume with just the Fire TV remote. I love this thing. Not sure why so many seem to have issues. This is an amazing device and well worth the money!",5,1,2018-11-28,1,1,0
"I had the older version of this and I noticed things about it that I didn't care for, so i'm glad that they have improved this fire stick.1. It now has a power button, which is fantastic because now maybe the batteries won't die so quickly like the other remote did.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
Love my Firestick! Easy to set up and ready to go right out of the package. When you plug in and turn on it automatically updates to the last eat version. Depending on you internet speed will determine how long it takes. For me it took about 15 minutes and after about 5 minutes to set it upUPDATE; I have revised my review. I have been using my new 4K Firestick for the last week or so and I have to say the experience has been horrible. No matter what app I try to watch something on it freezes and says it looses connection. I have checked my internet speed and it is fine and working properly. I have an older firestick and it works fine on the same apps with no freezing or buffering. Most of all no apps crash every time I try to watch something. The only plus is the remote with volume and power button where you can turn your tv on with the remote and control volume. I would wait to purchase this until they fix the bugs they have. Hopefully soon.,1,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"As far as I can tell, the Fire TV Stick works great. We have had cable forever and had been thinking about trying streaming services to reduce our monthly utility costs.  We are now saving about $50 a month and have many more choices than we did with cable.  The streaming, however, is not perfect.  Right now we are using Frndly and YouTube tv.  They both have choices and features we really like, but also have some downfalls.  YouTube tv has many choices with local, movie and sports channels available.  The part I don't like about it is sometimes a box pops up saying ""Are you still watching?'  and if you don't answer the tv goes off.  This is a problem for  2 reasons. One, my 93 year old mother lives with us and she isn't able to understand the firestick remote to answer when the box pops up so if she's watching tv and I'm not around when that box pops up, the tv goes off and she doesn't have anything to watch.  If we are gone for several hours and that happens, it is a real problem.  I have tried to find out if there is anyway to get rid of that feature, but haven't found a way as of yet. Or if I'm in the other room just listening to the tv and don't see the box pop up next thing I know the tv is off.  YouTube tv needs to fix that.  Also we love the features on Frndly and the 72 hour playback ability, the only problem is that at time the actual streaming seems to mess up and you end up with a circle going round and round like it is trying to load the program.  I know these are more reviews on the streaming services than the Firestick, but just wanted to let others who are considering changing to streaming some of the holdbacks.  Mostly I would just advise if you have a loved one with dementia, cable may be a better choice than streaming because you can't just push the channel button up and down to find something to watch.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0

Bought this 4K fire stick and ethernet adapter after reading reviews. I'm returning fire stick when used over wireless network constantly buffers and than cuts off.  Even worse when using the etherent adapter. Wireless router sits right next to TV and I have 400 mbps service and 3 year old Samsung TV.My none 4K fire stick works better than this 4K model.

"I've used a number of platforms for streaming, the last one being the Roku stick.  After using it the first day a message appeared informing me the stick was overheating.  Unsure about its authenticity, I went to the back of the TV and sure enough it was so hot I immediately shut it down and when it cooled I removed it.  Never thought about reinstalling it.Subsequently I ordered the Amazon Fire Stick 4K, have been using it for about one week and its been outstanding.  No issues with overheating at all.  It was very easy to set up.  The apps that came with it were some I've used before and I was pleased they were immediately available.  I ordered additional apps which were downloaded quickly and ready for use.  The remote has volume control which my previous remotes did not have which made it necessary to keep the TV remote handy.  I'm very pleased with its performance and recommend it most highly.",5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"Our smart TV was getting a bit old, and some of the aps' versions were no longer supported (and couldn't be updated).  We bought the fire stick mainly to overcome this problem; however, we were very pleased when the response and streaming experiences were much better than those with the smart TV only.  Both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video response times are much faster.  In addition, there is more streaming opportunities than you can possibly watch.  So far, I haven't been too impressed with the voice aspects of the remote.  I would say it works about 60% of the time; however, the hand remote itself is so simple, I rarely even want or need to use a voice command.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,1,0
"The purpose of getting the 4K Fire TV was to watch movies with Atmos. Tried to watch 4K Atmos recorded movie (Jack Ryan) and I could get Dolby Surround + . I called Amazon tech support and they suggested me to upgrade my internet speed to 15Kbps. I subscribed for the blaster internet which is 1000Kbps, though the maximum speed I could get is between 480Kbps and 500kbps, which is way beyond 15Kbps. To my dismay, I could not get Atmos sound, while Atmos worked very well when watching movies on Netflix using 4K Apple TV. Overall sound and picture quality improved significantly but Atmos did not work. Amazon tech support could not help. Any suggestion from the 4K Fire TV users is appreciated.",4,1,2019-9-5,1,1,0
"I tried setting up my newly purchased Fire TV Stick 4K but could not get it to pair/sync with my new Samsung UHDTV.  To begin, I had a difficult time removing the back cover of the remote to insert the batteries.  After several tries I was able to remove the cover and install the batteries.  The cover was VERY stiff and hard to slide off.  I then hooked the device up to my TV but could not get the Fire Stick to turn on or to recognize my TV or my TV to recognize the Fire Stick.  After numerous tries (about 45 minutes) and even trying different plug-ins behind my TV I finally gave up.  I reinstalled my old Roku and presto!  My TV immediately recognized my Roku and connected with no problem.  I thought it would be nice to use the Fire Stick with my recently purchased Amazon Prime account but I'll stick with Roku ... at least I know that works.  I have returned the Fire Stick to Amazon ... lesson learned.",2,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

"Before getting the Fire Stick, we used to stream programs via the Wii U until they began dropping apps like Hulu and Amazon Prime. To be blunt, I wish I had switched a long time ago. Setup was easy and fairly quick. No more charging the Wii pad, so many more apps to select from, just a small receiver vs a console taking up space on the media cabinet. The wifi connection is great despite the router being on the opposite end of the house. I am more than pleased with this purchased.

"I have many 2nd generation Firesticks.  This was on sale, so I figured I'd see if it's worth the upgrade to the 4k model.  It's peppier and zippier.  My main gripe is that I got it for the tv control.  It's downright awful with my Vizio TV.  I have to get up and be standing directly in front of the tv, a few feet away for the power and volume/mute buttons to work.  This is my main gripe.  Since that's most of the reason I wanted to upgrade, it fails.  Why can't it use CEC to control audio and the tv?  The RF/bluetooth  control of the fire stick itself is very good.  IR, very bad.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0
"The stick I received didn’t work. This was my 2nd as Ive had one for the living rm tv for almost 2 yrs and it works fine. I wanted one for the bedroom tv. With this one the remote won’t work the tb volume and if I turn the tv off or go to another source when I go back to the fire stick it’s not there, I literally have to get up and unplug it from the phone wall, power source, plug it back in for it to show up. What’s worse is after calling Amazon and having them walk me thru the set up process, it still not working Amazon said they would send me a replacement. Then the rep goes away comes back to say they can’t send a replacement but will give me a credit for the $42.38 I paid and I could reorder another one. After agreeing that I want another one I was informed the new price is almost $8.00 more, what the heck??? I get I broken product want to return it and have to pay more?? What type of customer service is that? It’s not my fault i got a dud and want to exchange it for one that works, but I have to pay more. After getting upset they get back on the phone and tell me they are going to give me a promotional credit that I’ll see in a few days but can’t use it to place the order for the new stick at that time.

"Reason for only 4 stars is the fact that amazon failed to understand when you have many devices and family and friends over we need more then just 10/100mbps for internet speed on our fire sticks. I have 500mbps internet speed from Spectrum but during holidays it struggles and I have the best modem and best router that's fully compatible with Spectrum so please amazon for future fire sticks please make them 10/100/1000mbps. I bought a Netgear USB wireless wifi device that's AC1900 for only $45.00 dollars and it's running @485mbps strong so please Amazon get with the times and understand we have many devices connected to our Router and Modems so we need fire sticks to be stronger. ""Also please upgrade the Remote we need a ""previous button"" on the remote and better ways to Navigate through Live TV.

If you plan to use it at multiple locations, meaning multiple ISP's, it will not allow you to connect until you reset it to ""new"", which means you have to re-install ALL your apps, etc. every time you want to take it to a friends house for movie night.

"First of all I'd like to get to my main problem with the Amazon Fire Stick 4K.  I already have several Apple TV's and a Roku streaming device, all with CBS All Access.  Our subscription is with CBS directly so it was very easy to add to Apple TV and the Roku.  Amazon's Fire Stick is very different, you cannot use your existing subscription to CBS All Access.  You can only start a new subscription which I thought was very strange but this was confirmed with Amazon customer service.  Only Amazon knows why they decided to implement CBS All Access this way.  Since it would be crazy to have two CBS All Access subscriptions I have decided to return the Fire Stick since it doesn't give me any more benefits than I already have on the Apple TV's and the Roku.  I do like the layout of the Fire Stick and it works great but the CBS All Access issue is something I have a big problem with.  At some point in time maybe they'll fix this issue, if they do then I'll be back.",3,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
"I upgraded from the 2nd generation Fire Stick to the 4k and there most definitely is a speed difference. Not nearly the lag time between screens and things zip along nicely. A couple things I would do to improve the remote would be to add a dedicated button for the OTA channel guide. It’s quite cumbersome to have to navigate to it each time you want to use it. Also, it would be nice for the TV to turn on to the same channel it was on when I turned it off. Each time you turn on the TV you have to pound your way through a series of buttons just to get back to the OTA channels. One last thing would be to add an “exit” button. If I am watching something on TV and decide to scan through the channel guide, there’s no way to exit to get back to what you were watching other than to scroll back to that channel and hit the enter button. An exit button would simplify that. Once you get use to how things work with the fire stick you can more easily get where you want to go. It’s just that it can take getting use to.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"My PS3 (yes, it's nearly two models old) is finally in the process of giving up the ghost, so I purchased both the Chromecast and the Fire TV Stick 4K to compare them. They both are excellent products and have their perks. I enjoy the Chromecast because I can cast pretty much any media using my phone. However, where movies and apps are concerned, I LOVE the new Fire TV Stick 4K! I was able to pair the controller to my television and audio transceiver; with that, I can turn on/off both with the Firestick controller and turn up/down the volume. Using the microphone, I can request any movie, television show, or application install it and follow simple steps to connect previously subscribed programs (i.e., Showtime, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, ABC, NBC, CBS, YouTube). Ultimately, the controller is simple, does what it needs to do, and is easy to use. Overall, I am wholly satisfied with this product—five stars on all accounts from me.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0

It  took me a while to figure out it was the 4k stick causing the problem because we were right in the middle of getting rid of our cable.  Did a factory reset with Amazon customer service but it went right back to the sync being off.  Swapped this one with another I had here and no problem since.  Tomorrow I plan to try to return it.

"I bought this device last week and it's really a great device.  During setup, I was surprised how well it detected all my equipment and configured my remote with little interaction from me.  All it did was ask me to use the volume up and down buttons to verify that everything was working correctly.  After setup, the remote was able to control the volume of my receiver.  It was also able to turn on the TV, and receiver, using the power buttons. The Home button could also switch inputs as well.  The most impressive thing was, even if the Fire Stick is unplugged, the remote still works and can control my equipment.  This means that if you use a USB port, on your TV, to power the Fire Stick and the Fire Stick only has power when the TV is on, the remote will sticll work when the TV is off.  This is really a great feature.Since the remote has a microphone, you can use it to change channels by voice. You can change channels by channel number of name of the station.  In addition, you can speak into the microphone, on the remote, and say ""Switch to input 3"", and the remote will emit the required IR code to switch inputs.",5,1,2019-1-30,1,0,0
"This isn't my first streaming stick, but it is my first fire stick. It wasn't easy to set up. It was hard to get the remote open to install the batteries. The remote power button doesn't actually light up, so I couldn't tell if it wasn't working because of me or the batteries. The cord isn't long enough to plug into the outlet, and it wouldn't work plugged into an extension cord. I finally got it set up, and I was prepared to start ""slinging"" with my promotional code bought during Prime Day. The code worked, but only for a $25 per month package. My email stated I could get three months for $15 with the code, but when I tried to get that package, my code wouldn't work. So, I could only get the $25 per month package and pay $9.99 extra each month. I wasn't happy about that at all. I will say the picture quality is great. I guess having Alexa is cool, but I'm not convinced it is cool enough for the headache of setting it up and not getting the promotion I was promised.",2,1,2019-8-31,1,1,0

"I bought this because my somewhat older Smart TV would not support live streaming TV News on Hulu and I was not able to upgrade the software to do so.  Hulu recommended a device like the Fire Stick, or Roku, or Chromecast to solve my issue.  The Fire Stick arrived and was easy to hook up. However, my 4K Fire Stick only sees my 2.4 Ghz wireless (not my 5 Ghz) and often drops the connection altogether.  Once this dropping of the connection begins, I have to reboot the Fire Stick, forget my wireless connection, and then reconnect to the wireless network again.  It takes two or three minutes each time.  It will do this over and over, every five to ten minutes, until I finally throw my hands up and swear and turn the TV off.  Other times it will work for days without doing this, but eventually it always starts up again.  I'm an IT guy, so I'm savvy on this stuff.  The issue is not my wireless network.  My wife and I watch TV together, and don't run anything off wireless other than the Fire Stick. Everything else is hardwired to the router, which is always preferable anyways.  I've noted the very helpful ""help tips"" from Amazon where they tell me to plug in an Ethernet cable to the Fire Stick, but unfortunately, Amazon forgot to put an Ethernet port on the Fire Stick (so they could save about 30 cents in manufacturing).  My only option now is to buy Amazon's Ethernet port adapter for an additional $15, but the reviews on the adapters are stupendously bad considering they're just an adapter. Apparently the Ethernet adapters are as hit and miss as the Fire Sticks themselves.  I may have to go this route if I can't find another solution.  As it is right now, most of the time the Fire Stick works as it should, but when it starts dropping the wireless signal, it's worse than worthless to me.  So the two stars are barely earned considering that this thing cost me 40 bucks and it's often worth zero bucks.",2,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0

"Update:While I was initially over the moon about this product, I’ve changed my rating from a 5 start to a 3 star rating. This is due to the fact that, for whatever reason, the fire stick causes all sound to cut out despite any attempts to turn up volume, mute and unmute, etc. The only remedy is to the unplug it from the tv and plug it back in again which consistently works. This happens probably twice a week (and did not happen before with past fire sticks).",3,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"I wanted to give this 5 stars but after having it for a little over a month I can't. We bought it for my son for his birthday because that's what he wanted. It was also half the price. So we thought such a great deal, since we have the older ones. I plugged it in and followed the instructions (this is our 3rd firestick but 1st of this generation) anyway he had it on his TV for a couple of weeks and his TVs back light went out (I'm assuming that's what it is, you can hear it and you can see the picture only with a flashlight) his TV isnt even a year old. So we bought a TV for him and put it on that one, thinking maybe it was just his TV itself but today marks 2 weeks that it's been on this brand new TV and low and behold it has done the same thing to this one. So idk what the issue is. But looks like I'm going to have to buy another tv once again and not use this firestick on it. Such a bummer because it was great at first but now even worse since I have to fork out more money for another TV. 🙄 Be cautious. Maybe the half priced ones had some sort of defect in them. 🤷‍♀️",1,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"it is not faster, not better than my 3yr old android tv box, which was able to do 4k, I got this because I will be losing netflix on my tv box soon, with this, even connected to the ethernet adapter and wired to the router, coming from a 80mbps connection... will not do 4k streaming at all, I tried the youtube app in it and lo and behold, the app will not do better than 1080p, other apps crash, I tried streaming the boys on amazon in 4k and the view became very tiny and it buffered for a long time, in contrast the old tv box would flawlessly stream in 4k, important note:every app you download into this, which is capable of 4k, will immediately be relegated to a max of 1080p/60fps by the firestick, I tried dcuniverse, YouTube, vudu, vimeo, the only way you can stream 4k is by using the browser..  I decided to give this to my mother, I guess I should buy something else, which I did!! I ordered an nvidia shield, and I am not shilling for them, but I must point out how much better a product it is than this firestick, don't waste your money on this bad product from Amazon",1,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
I have been running our big screen TV off an old mac desktop  for many years now with only a few problems like graphics card updates and other computer blah blah blah stuff. A fire stick and it is a marvelous improvement including the picture quality. Made me feel like a silly old guy who just learned I could use my phone to access the internet. The Fire Stick was easier than my computer to hook up to the TV  and delivered immediate satisfaction within 10 minutes. It has a few silly draw backs like the way the buttons on the remote are a little goofy and some of the updates made it quit working but within ten minutes to very savvy tech help on the phone had me up and running again. Also It is great to have a remote . Alexa is not that user friendly when it comes to finding movies or music.  I find it faster to type out the movie or music you are looking for.  So the Fire Stick gets a happy 4 stars.,4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"My primary reason for purchasing this was for Disney Plus and it works great.  It was simple to set up and just took a few minutes.  It was able to connect with my Sony TV and Receiver so the FireTV remote will change the volume, ect.  It works flawlessly with Prime Video and Music as could be expected.  Puts up a slideshow of my photos that are on my Amazon Photo app as a screen saver which is nice.  I have number of other Alexa devices like an Echo Show, Echo plus, echo dot.  I am still figuring out how all of those work together.  For example even though my FireTV shows the receiver as connected and the receiver shows up in my Alexa app, telling the Echo Show to turn on the receiver doesn't seem to work.  So there are a few things that aren't as intuitive as I would like, but I am guessing I will figure it out.  Using the Alexa on the remote works fine with the receiver.  I am pretty happy with purchase.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

"This FireStick 4K was no better than the regular FireStick. A piece of junk!! The picture quality more times than not is horrible...blurry, cloudy, pixated, poor. Amazon needs to take a lesson from Netflix and put the Amazon App back on peoples TVs instead of being so money hungry by Bezos. With all the problems these FireSticks have had I don't think I'll be renewing my prime membership this year. There were never any problems with the picture quality or the App when it was on TVs. I can see why Netflix beats out Amazon...their App is still available on TVs and they have no problem giving good picture quality to people with Smart TVs which was Amazon's excuse of getting rid of their TV App when the real reason was greed. Bezos has millions of dollars but doesn't want to put it into his company to update things to higher quality so people can enjoy watching Amazon on their TVs the way they use to.",2,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0

First, my surround sound is not compatible with the Firestick, therefore I have only TV volume.  2nd, I have to flip the TV to HDMI 4 to have Alexa capabilities?  3rd, the Firestick 4K came without the new HBOMAX app in the app menu, it was not available on a search of “HBOMAX”, and the HBOGO app I was able to download is expiring at the end of July.  These are not all of my issues, just the most frustrating ones.  If I could have given no stars ⭐️ for the categories of ‘Voice Recognition’ and ‘Alexa Integration’, I would have.  I had a professional A/V guy install and network my systems, so I am not an inexperienced person trying to go it alone.

"When it works, it works well. The issue is when you are not watching it for a few hours it is not working and needs to be rebooted. The screen says if this continues contact Amazon support which I have done 3 times. Guess what their solution is? Restart the device. Yes that does solve the issue temporarily, but it happens over and over and over again. Sometimes I have to restart it three times before it starts working.

"As an Amazon Prime member I really enjoy watching the free movies and tv series. I haven’t had any issues with it buffering while streaming and the remote is fast and responsive too. Since I didn’t want any wires showing I have the stick powered by one of the USB ports. The trade off is that it takes a little bit more time for it to turn on and you can’t tell Alexa to turn it on for you. I only did this because there isn’t an electrical outlet behind my wall mounted tv. Prime also has some 4K stuff to watch so with this Fire Stick and a 4K tv, you’re good to go.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,1,0

When it stopped working I went through all of the ""Easy fixes"" I ran up to  my local CVS & bought a 4 pk of the most expensive new Duracell Optimum AAA batteries as batteries seem to be one of the big issues with keeping this working. You have to make sure you go into settings every time your finished using the Firestick 4K. I am at this point so frustrated as it just won't work. I've ordered the wire that connect the stick directly to the tv so that it has a direct connection to my internet. If this doesn't work I'm returning everything & I will expect Amazon to pay for some of these batteries too.  I'm very let down with this product as I love Amazon.

"I live with roommates and like to watch shows using my bluetooth headphones so as not to disturb anyone. This works great. I'm able to connect the stick to 5GHz bandwidth router while connecting headphones via 2.4 with no issues. Obviously this stick works best if you're a prime member and use Prime Video. I'm a member so the Amazon eco system works fine for me. I don't find the Amazon home screen too intrusive and it generally has prime video suggestions for stuff I actually watch. It's fast and snappy in playing videos and I haven't really noticed any latency in use. I also love that it powers on and controls my TV volume as I would hate to manage a separate remote just to turn on the TV each time before switching to the Fire remote. It's crazy cheap to the point where it seems obvious Amazon is trying to get this, along with Alexa, in every home but it's simply a great value. No complaints, it gets the job done at a great price.

Considering I am saving $100 a month off my cable bill I can put up with a few glitches.  several times a week the voice and picture will not be in time so a reboot is needed. I did upgrade my internet to 300mbs and run about 280 when tested. I also purchased a dual channel router.  this seems to be enough to get good picture quality on multiply devices throughout the house.  I was concerned about data usage but the first month should come in around 750GB and I am allotted 1.2TB on my plan so that should be all good.  The menu is different and just like any other format.  Twice in a month I received an error message (Not sure it's a Fire Stick issue or YouTubeTV issue)  lost internet signal and checked and my signal was fine and it showed I had a good connection in the menu but would not load a picture on YouTube TV but after 10 minutes it came back on.  Strange I was able to watch on puter at the same time so I am not sure what that's about.  FireStick you can load all the apps you want and access any TV or live software.

"I purchased my first Fire TV Stick 4K back in July 2019 and I fell in love immediately. It was SUPER fast, and not just in comparison to my Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote. There was no lag time when streaming videos. I did have some interface issue with Hulu and Netflix, but both were resolved after a tech responded to my complaint on a FB ad for the 4K stick.  The 4K stick is also bigger than the first Fire Stick, but that's a small price to pay for the much faster processor. I knew about the volume control feature on the 4K when I purchased it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the 4K stick remote could also power on and off my TV *and* my sound bar.

"Like any other fire device this thing just works. I'm running a mixture of normal apps and unauthorized apps ( a VPN that I had to side-load among other things ). This thing just works. When the VPN is on amazons banner ads get a bit fruity and some apps namely Netflix & Hulu act a bit erratically, but that s a function of location spoofing and not the hardware's fault. It doesn't get hot enough to cause concern and functions like any other fire device. My only gripe is the lack of physical Ethernet jacks, but amazon in their infinite wisdom decided it was good enough to stream 4k content over WiFi. Basically if your routers decent and isn't overloaded with opposing WiFi signals, like it would be in an apartment complex it works. If not have fun streaming 4K content. Wired Ethernet would prevent this by removing WiFi radio interference out of the equation but that costs money and amazon wants this to be as cheap as possible, to get you in their ecosystem. Over all for $50 its a definite buy just beware of WiFi signal saturation in your area IF you will be streaming 4K.",5,1,2019-4-6,1,0,0
"This Fire stick is a great substitute to having a cable subscription. Before getting this handy little device, we had xfinity cable for a great. While it was nice having cable, we were watching the majority of our TV (80+ percent) via streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, prime video and HBO). Paying for both streaming services and cable made no sense so we went with the fire stick only. Best decision ever!The 4K fire stick has great display quality on just my 1080p TV and the interface is easy to work with. I'm sure Apple TV or another high dollar device probably has a better interface and remote (this one is a little flimsy) but for the cost (less than $30 at the time) this device cannot be beat.

Consequently I am rushing to watch the videos I have left in my watchlist on the Smart TV side prior to 9/26 while they are still free as I am finding that most of them are no longer included with Prime and you have to purchase another streaming option (e.g.britbox).

"I expected a lot better from my Fire Stick.  I have several Roku Sticks which I have been using for about a year.  I felt that the speed after selecting a show or channel until it loads and starts playing was slow.  My wifi network and internet speed is very fast.  I have 500/500 speed and an Orbi mesh system.  I get a very strong signal and excellent internet speed throughout my home.  So I thought I would try a Fire Stick.  I was very disappointed in the Fire Stick.  The speed appears to be no faster than my Roku devices.  In addition, the Roku menu layout and navigation is far superior in my opinion to that of the Fire Stick. The Roku menu layout is cleaner and far less cluttered. Lately, about every couple of days my Fire Stick locks up and none of the buttons work.  The only way I have found to fix the problem is to unplug the power to the Fire Stick then plug it back in.  This hasn't happened with any of my Roku devices.

"Fire stick is great for the price but given how you can’t download HBO Max and other apps widely available on most every other streaming service, it becomes less appealing. The UI is terrible, clunky, and easy to get lost in. The voice search feature barely works and in some cases, using voice search will cause your fire stick to turn off. Streaming video quality is also generally pretty poor.

"My life just got so much more convenient! You have no idea how much I love this product. I chose the fire tv stick over the cube mainly because of the remote. You have volume and power options on the remote (the cube doesn’t be have volume controls). I only need the fire tv remote for my tv now. It’s great ONLY needing one remote; it just makes everything so much simpler. I have an echo dot which I use to pause my tv as I’m walking out of the room if the remote isn’t handy. You can also ask you echo to play shows and she gives you options if that show is available on more than one app which one you want to play it from. There’s less of a delay when making requests directly with the remote (even by voice). I haven’t really had any issues with the fire tv at all related to lagging or anything of the sort that wasn’t just a problem with my WiFi. The app organization is solid.A lot of people have complained that the fire tv platform pushes a lot of ads... it has  suggestions texts at the bottom of the screen that come up with the screen saver and a recommendations banner at the top of the screen with your apps below. I really don’t find that to be problematic at all. I don’t see this as being spammy in anyway considering I generally subscribe to the app that the recommendation is linked to. If anything, it’s Somewhat convenient in finding new content considering you don’t get commercials and movie trailers like you do with traditional tv viewing. The image looks nice. The setup was incredibly easy; It even has an attachment if you can’t have the stick plugged directly into your tv. With deals you could control your tv with your voice for only $70 for an echo dot and a fire tv stick, possibly even less. That’s pretty luxurious for such a low price.",5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
Works exactly as I expected it to. Voice response works without issue. There are plenty of apps available. Far easier than relocating the laptop every time I needed the browser. Hulu integration is a bit of an issue as the menu selection doesn't persist when the Hulu app is launched but I suspect that is more a fault of the app than the device.  I have not needed to look anywhere else to get the unit working in its default configuration (ie youtube etc). Works better than the built in Visio amazon feature as it adds the ability to fast forward Amazon content. There is also noticeably better video quality and no frame rate drops in comparison to using the Visio built - in apps. At this point no regrets in the purchase.,5,1,2019-8-14,1,1,0

"This is built on Android, so you should get Android TV but of course this is Amazon so you do not. The UI they decided to put over it is junk it trys to get you to watch things on prime video constantly which I find annoying. Fortunately Google and Amazon started to play nicer again which means a YouTube app is available again but for the longest time this was not available.The UI was annoying but not the reason I no longer use this thing, there were two factors here. First being if the device was on too long it would become nearly unusable. The audio became a couple seconds behind and all input was very delayed until it was restarted. The other issue was with the mobile app. There are a few small kids in my house so the remote was difficult to keep track of, so the mobile app should have been great for us! It was not. They only recently let you use the keyboard which is insane, that should have been there from the start but it also just refused to work half the time.

"I had high expectations for this device. The 4k projection,  volume control for devices, ability to download 3rd party apps, internet ability and few other perks like Alexa are all great. However it doesn't seem to provide much space for apps and needs restarted frequently as it tends to blackout/timeout frequently.  Alexa doesn't seem to understand commands as well as thought initially either which make Alexas use basically useless. The structure for app selection could use a makeover to better simplify use. All in all I feel Roku makes a better quality product that is more user friendly.  I find my Firestick not getting used even a 1/4 as much as I use my Roku. The app selection is basically the same for both with only a few apps on either to choose from that are different. Firestick does not support the Spectrum TV app which is a big downfall for me as a user. There's plus sides and downsides to Firestick.

"The Fire TV Stick 4K works well in delivering shows and movies, is easy to use, and fairly efficient when going from one media application to another in my Samsung. My reception and streaming is very good, as I have fiber optic delivery along with a quality high speed modem. The problem with the Fire TV Stick 4K (or cables, or set-up, not quite sure) is that when watching any other program not through the FS, such as a different broadcast input source, PC, DVD, etc., frequent horizontal fine white lines streak across the screen, some type of electrical interference. It could be jagged white lines every second for five seconds, a single white line once every ten seconds, a burst of multiple lines for five seconds, etc. Rarely is there any break in the line interference display for less than 20-30 seconds. I have tried re-positioning the device and cables, and verified the plugs were properly inserted into sockets, but with no resolution. Not sure where to look next, let alone resolve the annoying problem. It works well for its intended purpose (5 star), but it also screws up things that once worked well (0/1 star).",3,1,2019-5-1,1,0,0

But the AirTV mini is also junk. In any case, the firetv stick replaced the AirTV mini and subsequently replaced all remotes. It was able to pair with Samsung TV to adjust inputs by voice command. it was able to pair with soundbar for volume adjustment. The apps on Amazon firetv os are up to date. Instead of using Samsung's TVOS, I just use the firetv. The voice button for Alexa is very convenient to control my smart lights already intgrated with Alexa. One thing I didn't like is the bloat. There's a lot of crap on firetv interface. There are lots of promotions for things that aren't even installed.  I prefer to keep things simple to reduce scrolling. It's not really customizable. The bloat continues to show.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0

"When we upgraded our TV to a 4K smart TV I figured we should also upgrade to a 4K compatible fire stick.  Well, this thing repeatedly spins while trying to load, and often says our band width is too low.  That is a bunch of crap.  We have super high speed internet here and only one other device using our network, which has no problems at all.  Plus we never got those messages with the old one.  I don't know if this stick is a defected one or what, but I'm tempted to chuck it and put the old box back on.  I'm really disappointed in this new stick. :-(",3,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
"I decided to give this a try after my Roku box wasn’t able to get the latest updates/formats (I.e. Netflix & Hulu). I am officially a fire tv stick fan! The layout and ease to find shows is seamless and I only need one remote now as it turns on and off my tv, volume controls, etc. I also love that I can tell it to launch Prime or Netflix. I can tell it to pause, rewind, etc.). Streaming tv has never been easier! I plan to switch out my other two roku boxes with the fire tv stick. Another feature it has that roku didn’t was I only had to link my “tv provider” for the apps like NBC once and when I launched other apps that require provider login, it did it for me! Saved me lots of time and frustration of having to type in my login/password for each app that requires a tv subscriber (i.e. AT&T Uverse). They’ve thought of everything!",5,1,2019-8-23,1,1,0
"Super disappointed. I bought this to stream Disney + since none of my TV’s would stream it. When I looked at the Fire Stick it said it would stream it. I got it, set it up. Worked great with Hulu. When I tried to watch anything on Disney +, it would freeze or have no audio. I unplugged it, reset it. It played one short video then same thing again. It would freeze or audio wouldn’t work. So then we asked the Google. Good old Googs informed me that Disney and Amazon apparently have some beef and Disney did not approve Amazon to stream its content. Several people experienced the same problems. Also in case you have a Visio TV with Smart cast, it also will not stream Disney +. Shame on me. Next time I will be better about doing my homework. Everything else on the Fire Stick worked great. Just felt a little mislead that the description on Amazon did say you could stream Disney + on it and that doesn’t appear to be true. So I am returning it and getting a Roku.",2,1,2019-11-18,1,1,0
"I upgraded from an Apple TV (3rd Generation, not the newer better one) to the 4k Firestick.  What a huge difference in capability.  One of my favourites is bluetooth to connect to bluetooth headphones, so I can listen to shows while doing work around home and walking from room to room.  The Apple TV had bluetooth, but only for keyboards and such, and Apple didn't want to provide this capability it seems.  That to me is the difference between Apple and Amazon:  Amazon wants to give you features and a great product so that you'll subscribe to Prime (Video) and use it.  Apple, on the other hand, seems to want to hold back features and keep the ""fan boys"" waiting.  Their latest Apple TV is a complete RIP-OFF compared to the Firestick 4K  (especially if you bought the fire stick on Prime Day!)Other things I use so far:  Plex.  Runs so well on the Firestick.  The library of apps available is enormous and am really liking it.  Streaming services are running very well so far on it.  I also",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0

So after the second one came and it didn't work on voice command OR the picture quality, I sent both back and said forget it...I plugged my old Fire stick back in and works fine.

"I am about to throw this out the window.  The Fire TV Stick will NOT control the sound.  I have gone through the set-up variations many times, tried all the applicable options, etc., etc.  The instructions on te brochure (replace batteries, get closer to TV) were done and are useless, then it instructs you to go to /devicesupport which has the exact same useless information.  After an hour of trying to get the volume to work, it doesn't matter how easy or hard it is to add apps or anything else.  The remote control does NOT CONTROL.  What junk this is, who needs this much frustration.  Back to the Roku, which has issues of it's own, like coming un-synced, but at least that can be re-done.

It synced right up to my older Panasonic plasma tv to control the power, volume, mute..AND because my Plasma is a little older i could never adjust on my second generation you couldn't adjust the aspect ratio... but with this you can right inside the firestick settings!

Step up Amazon, credit my account the difference.I inquired as to the ability of using the Xfinity streaming app and was told, yes.  After installation I try to do exactly that, nope can not be done.

All of them keep getting better and better, They allow you to install basically any android app from the internet which makes them usable with apps like KODI and IPTV streaming services. Its worked very well for my needs and functions as expected. Although a few downsides are that the controller is not grippy at all and is very very easy to slip out of your hand, Its almost as if it was intentionally designed slippery so you will buy a grip for it for more money.  Also Alexa's voice recognition is a hit or miss and can be downright frustrating at times to get her to recognize certain words.Final thoughts: If you dont mind spotty voice recognition from Alexa and a slippery controller design you will have no issues lol.

"So, due to my lack of need for the advanced features of my 2017 Shield TV and it's garbage remote I decided to try the 4k Firestick (I replaced a 2nd gen FS with the Shield) due to it's improved performance and the recent inclusion of YouTube TV. While this thing is 90% of what I want, that last 10% is a bit of a killer, and that is when the Firestick goes to ""sleep"" it still delivers a signal to the HDMI port, which keeps the TV on with a black screen and the backlight on. So, while I will likely keep this device, I won't use it, but rather will try and pair the remote with my shield so that it manages / recognizes my sound bar like it does with the Firestick. Also, I've found complaints for this going back years and yet Amazon opts not to address this, shows a true lack of concern re: Energy Efficiency.I'm glad I got this for 1/2 price as the remote alone is more expensive.",3,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I relied on a cable box for about 40 years, so there has been a learning curve for me in using the Fire stick. The picture is really great, with only occasional ""buffering"" pauses. It takes longer to ""turn on"" the TV, as I must select the App every time (usually Fi TV, which carries all my regular cable channels). I'm a member of Amazon Prime, so I have started to make use of the Prime TV choices, which are generally quite good. One awful feature is that the screen periodically freezes to ask if I am ""still watching."" The only way to resume is to click the remote, which can be very inconvenient if you are on a treadmill, or painting a wall, or baking a pie. (Checking FAQs on line suggests that there is no way to override this annoyance.) The only time I used the Alexa feature was out of desperation, when the Fire stick kept turning on subtitles no matter how many times I turned them off. I asked Alexa to turn them off, and, amazingly enough, that actually worked.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"My telephone company recently upgraded my DSL from 1Mbps to 5Mbps.  And now I have an internet connection that’s fast enough to stream shows to my television, instead of downloading videos to my iPad which was seriously affecting my vision. But now I could take full advantage of my Prime Video by using Fire TV Stick 4K.  Next hurdle?  I only have one HDMI connection on my tv.  I added an HDMI switch to my order and a second HDMI cable.  All arrived in 2 days, so now I was all set to connect everting.. with crossed fingers.Hooking it all up went smoothly.  My Fire Stick already appeared in my Alexa app on my iPad.  I placed batteries in the remote, signed into my Amazon account onscreen, and after the setup (very easy to follow) I started watching my shows I previously placed in my wish list on my iPad app.  I found the remote excellent, and using Alexa on the was wonderful, made searches ever so simple.",5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"I purchased this product due to its great price and how quickly it would arrive. When I finally received it, I quickly set it up and couldn’t keep it connected to my internet for some reason. At first, I thought it was my router/provider that was the issue, so when I unplugged/reconnected my router, I checked the fire stick once more and still had no luck. This time around I knew it must be the fire stick because my phone, laptop, etc. was connected and working fine. It finally stuck with the fire stick after two hours of disconnecting/reconnecting/resetting everything so I tried to watch a rented movie and the connection would drop again every 15/20 minutes. The rental fee for the movie was even credited back to me because they saw how poor the connection was on the device. Turns out, my brother gave his away because of the same exact problem! It may just be a minor issue they suffer as a product but irritating none the less. I hope they can get this resolved soon so less people keep disposing/returning them. I returned it immediately with all its original packaging.",1,1,2019-1-9,1,2,0
A while back I was gifted with the Fire Stick before this model. It had Alexa but not 4K and it didn't have the volume control or power button on the remote. I honestly didn't realize how much better the Fire Stick would be. I knew that it would obviously have some improvements from the last model but this really is a breath of fresh air.It's more discrete now that it is an HDMI USB insert rather than a huge square connected to an HDMI cord. You still have to plug it into a power source but it still is much more discrete and less bulky in the back of the television. The graphics are obviously much crisper but make sure your television can handle 4K. I put my old Fire Stick on my second television that can't handle 4K. The newer one is connected to my Samsung TV.,5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"I bought  2 4K firesticks less than 2 years ago and the one in the living room started ""low app storage"" we don't have many apps downloaded .we started clearing data daily having to sign into Netflix hulu and that became unmanageable.

The remote buttons are easy to find and it works well, but I did almost lose a fingernail removing the battery cover the first time, but now it slides off and on easily.

"I had the original fire TV stick. The remote for it was less than great- there was no volume control, no power button and no voice control. The new remote comes with all of that and is a major improvement. Set up seemed easy initially, until I tried to sync it to my echo or use the voice control. I had to install 4 updates and deregister the device, then register again (and subsequently uninstall then reinstall all the apps I had installed during the initial set up) before my alexa app/echo could find the fire tv or register voice commands. Everything works now, but it was frustrating to figure out what was wrong and I had to call customer service. I wouldn't have figured it out on my own. This is a good way to watch tv, listen to music or watch youtube on your tv aside from the initial issues.Edit: I'm now having issues with downloading free apps because of a ""payment issue"". My 1-click payment settings are all up to date. This thing is extremely frustrating to deal with but good when it actually works.",3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I replaced the older (I think the first version) of the Fire TV Stick with this model. The former worked well for years but it became outdated, recently I had problems to start Netflix on it. I do not use voice / Alexa at all as I am old-fashioned and do not like even friendly surveillance in the house, nor my TV has 4K capabilities. Putting these (useful to some) features aside, the new stick is much faster, works flawlessly, picture quality is really great, and I like new buttons on its remote that allow me to control TV on/off and sound. The old stick remote did not have that. Interestingly, the remote learned how to control my TV by itself, I did not have to put it in the learning mode nor enter any codes as remotes of the few years ago needed. Another good thing of the Fire stick is automated updates of the FireOS. It allows for easy sideloading of services that are Android apps but are not part of the Amazon ecosystem, which is a BIG plus. Overall, I am really happy with this purchase, it is a great combination of features, freedom of choice, and price. Thank you Amazon!",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"This firestick is very nice!  It pairs easily to your tv so if you are like me and have cut the cable cord then you only need this one remote instead of the tv remote, cable remote and Firestick remote!  I gave the Alexa integration 3 stars because its not very easy to set everything up with different people's voices and all that!  I have tried to do the ""household"" set up so we could ask Alexa to do different alarms and reminders and lists per whomever's voice she heard but it ended up getting confusing and wasn't working so I gave up.  They need an app to where you can call customer service and do a visual chat and screen sharing so they can see what all you are doing and help!  Other than that, which is probably all my fault this is a great unit and I am grateful that Amazon put them on sale for a bit so we could get one for the bedroom since the tv in here is just a basic tv.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0

"We use Fire TV Sticks on all of our TV's.  We also installed the ethernet cable adapters.  We also have an antenna that connects to a Fire TV recast.  The Fire TV Stick has a lot of great free apps that allow for streaming of all sorts of content.  Combined with the Fire TV recast, we get all of our local channels on all of our TV's.  Then add in the speed of the ethernet connection, and you have real time (no buffering) content across all your devices.We initially tried a cable cutting experiment on one TV before we actually cut cable.  The cost of the Fire TV stick was on sale, so it was low enough that we could try before we really invested any additional time or money.  The experience taught us that you really have to consider adding one or two paid streaming services, and that we really missed local channels, which is why we added an antenna and Fire TV recast.  Everything was working well, but there was occasional buffering from wifi - so we upgraded to the ethernet adapter, and now everything is fast and reliable.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"First, let me say FireStick TV 4K does streaming perfectly well. The apps load at a reasonable pace (100Mbps internet), the videos are clear, smooth and well detailed. For my HT application (Denon AVR, 65” 1080p Plasma TV, Paradigm speakers) it is a very functional solution, especially at this price point. My intended purchase on that day, was an Apple TV 4K, but the price stopped me cold. If you are setting up a 4K or greater resolution system, I can’t comment on what you see from FireStick TV.  Now for the issues: (1) Alexa seems to be something of a dimwit. E.G., she cannot search Hulu tv offerings with anything like reliability; (2) I continue to be mystified by what to le seem to be random viewing list offerings. A much more straightforward menu system would be appreciated. I’d especially like to have a system that doesn’t re-order the apps every time I watch something, interspersing apps and programs. I get the intent: show the user what he/she most recently watched. The apparent randomness is what sometimes leaves flummoxed.",4,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0

Even with Amazon specific content. Jack Ryan has lots of scenes with skies or walls a certain color and the HDR honestly looks worse than 1080p in general. Artifacts all over in those scenes completely defeating the purpose of HDR in the first place.

I then asked to cancel my subscription.In talking to Customer Service, I said that I don't want to pay for a service call or for a protection plan to cover their owned equipment.  Also I was up to $160 a month and it was too expensive.  They offered for me to sign up for the plan, get their equipment fixed, cancel the plan, and they would drop the price to half cost for 12 months of service.

I run a 7.1 surround Atmos setup and I cannot watch any Plex movies or any other apps that have a nice library of DTS or Atmos films.

"I was an early adopter of the original FireTV stick, and hadn't upgraded since.  Am using it on an old non-smart 720k flatscreen, and didn't think it would make any difference.  However, with watching more Hulu and Netflix, and the loading times associated on the old stick, decided when I saw the 4K stick at a good price that I'd go ahead and upgrade.  What a difference!  So much faster, more solid.  Easier navigation.  Love having the volume adjustment on the remote, even though I usually use my cable remote.  Just makes it easier having it both places depending on what I'm streaming.  Because the original generation stick was a bit clunky, I rarely watched any of the streaming services on my bedroom TV, now I don't have to think twice about it.  Can only imagine how this would be on a TV which was an actual SmartTV.  For the cost, don't even think about it.  Just upgrade!",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0

If in an app I needed to go to the menu find exit and answer the question when in the old days I just pressed the HOME button.  I decided that my time was worth more than the cost of a new one so I bought this one.  Keep in mind that I only bought this because the HOME button did not work on the old one.  I was happy to plug in the new one and presto chango i was right back where i started, THE HOME BUTTON DOES THE SAME THING ON MY NEW DEVICE, right out of the box.

I am able to watch You Tube TV and my other streaming services via a single UI.  I have been able to ditch the 3 remotes and combine into the one Kindle Stick remote.  The Kindle Stick remote controls my TV volume, powers the TV on/off, and controls the YouTube TV interface (as well as my other streaming services).  Simplicity.  One remote.  The picture clarity is 1080P through the streaming services.  The video is far superior than I was getting with Fios.

Don't waste your money....save five dollars and get the Chromecast. You will thank me for writing this.",1,1,2019-2-22,1,1,0
"I’d tried a Fire Stick from a couple generations ago years back and found it a bit glitchy, but when a deal popped up for this I figured I’d try it again. The interface has been sped up, and for the most part things seemed to work well, well enough that I ordered a second unit. Days later, an odd issue with the device popped up that soured me on the device and the customer service attached to it: neither device would give me the option to play episodes of a television season that I’d previously purchased from Amazon Instant Video; instead, it suggested that I play the episode via two streaming services to which I do not subscribe.This was some strange bug at the intersection of various divisions of Amazon, and when I contacted customer service I was bounced between them. I interacted with SIX different representatives whose entire arsenal of solutions consisted of restarting the device and de registering/reregistering the device. We tried lots of things, and it became clear that there was some persistent bug in the software or corruption in my specific instance of the show—the problem was somewhere on Amazon’s end. After an hour of being bounced between people, I lost faith that Amazon would be able to solve the problem with the devices and lost trust in the devices themselves. Representative Number Six was quite friendly as he processed a return so I could switch back to my old Roku, where my Amazon content plays just fine.",1,1,2019-7-22,1,1,0
this was a nightmare and it wasnt an easy trip to make it work and i have written several reviews now to have only hit he stupid back button on my mouse while moving it to edit my post so this is what you get for nowsupport was horrible and sort of abusive until a nice lady jumped in and even then it took 5 units to make 2 units work 2 of three shipments were late and teh voice thing is BS attempt to harvest cash thru firetv media when u have same media in plex or hulu or netflix .... making voice control a mostly fake feature,3,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"I do NOT recommend the fire stick. I don't know if it doesn't communicate with Vizio TVs or what, but this is the second fire stick I have purchased because it seemingly destroyed it's connection with my last vizio TV, and then the TV stopped functioning; I assumed it was unrelated - old TV... But today (this fire stick is a month or so old, the TV is only a few years old, given to me from my dad) I spoke into the remote, ""Finding Nemo."" It then asked for a 4-digit code (so my kids can't be purchasing things without permission) but there was no keyboard. I clicked different buttons on the fire stick, trying to get the keyboard to appear, but nothing. So I clicked the home button. Suddenly my tv went black but Action Locked! on the screen! So I called Amazon... He said unplug the fire stick, which I did, then plugged back in.. Now the TV turns on and after ONE SECOND it turns itself back off. With remote or power button on TV - same outcome! So, of course, he said it's an issue with my tv, call Vizio.... Thanks a lot! I'm going back to Roku!",1,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa built in, Dolby Vision, includes Alexa Voice Remote, latest releaseThis is our 6th Firestick. We have them in every room. By far the Firestick is the easiest best way to enjoy content. It's not perfect and none of the streaming devices are. We have Fiber to our house with 960Gbs down/ 900Gbs up on average. Some of the Firestick devices are wired and some use wifi. They all perform equally great. some of the older Firestick devices were starting to show some signs of slowing down and getting kind of sluggish. I did a reset and reinstalled the apps we are using most frequently and left out the ones we don't use anymore. The firesticks perked back up and ran as quickly as they did when they were new. If you plan on installing a lot of Apps just make sure to add more storage so the unit doesn't get bogged down.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"Don't get fooled by this device. All it does is provide an avenue or gateway to sites that require a paid subscription to view movies, news, local channels, etc.  There is nothing ""Free"" about viewing with this device that I have so far researched. Its like promoting Alexa Devices without understanding that you have to first subscribe to an internet provider before this device will work. My wife was 'sucked into this promotion' by QVC which tends to proliferate and embellish on products that really don't perform as you expect. If your looking for a way to connect to Netflix or Hulu, etc. this device will get you there quickly but all I wanted to do was watch Fox News and you have to have a subscription thru your Internet Provider like AT&T at an additional cost to watch a simple news channel. I figured it was a ruse but the wife really wanted to acquire it. I guess if you want to drop DirectTV or Dish and subscribe to a multitude of different media providers like Hulu, Sling, Netflix, etc you can watch HBO or Cinemax programs but to me will cost about the same and you have to rely on streaming thru your internet. I inadvertently signed up for Amazon Prime and did watch the Jack Ryan Series thru this device which was pretty good but that membership only allows a very thin spectrum of movies and shows.",2,1,2019-1-19,1,2,0

"PROBLEM: Too Wide, DC connection and AppsDISCUSSION: Construction of the Fire Stick leaves a lot to be desired of for those who have to use splitters due to the lack of HDMI slots on older model Flat screens  which only have one HDMI slot on them. Compared to ROKU, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is too wide for most splitters that prevents the use of the HDMI slot next to it on the splitters  and with the DC slot on the side of the Fire Stick rather than at the end, it prevents choice as to what HDMI slot that can be used on the splitter when more deices are using the splitter as well.",3,1,2019-6-3,1,1,0

"Having the Fire TV Stick 4K made it EASY and SIMPLE to ""cut the cord""!  Our side table used to be filled with various remote controls -- we're down to TWO, soon to be ONE (with my next Echo purchase). There are so many features that simplify ones life.  TV Search screens, for example, you don't have to find each letter!  You just go to search screens and TALK into your Fire TV Stick and it spells it out for you!  Another added bonus, this time of year I like to watch Christmas movies.  I just TALK into my Fire TV Stick and say ""Christmas Movies"" and it displays a TON of movies!!!  I have a Fire TV stick on 3 televisions and when I travel I take one with me.  I'm a fan of Amazon Prime and Netflix... yep... just talk to the Fire TV Stick!

"I have a 2016 LG OLED C6 TV that supports Dolby Vision. I bought the Fire TV Stick 4k due to this support. Through far too much troubleshooting, I've discovered that the 2016 LG OLEDs do not support Dolby Vision at 60Hz, but do at 30Hz, which is what is causing issues.The issue I then have with the Fire Stick is that when it is set to AUTO (up to 4k) for display setting, it does show Dolby Vision content on my TV, but it only outputs at 1080p. In fact, I've been unable to get it to show anything in 4k when set to AUTO. As soon as I manually set it to 2160p (4k), it outputs everything as it should in 4k, but it will not show Dolby Vision (only HDR).",2,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"I bought this to replace the streaming capabilities of the Samsung Smart TV and older Chromecast, previously used both to be able to use all my streaming services. I love that the Fire Stick works with seamlessly with all the streaming I use, Amazon Prime, Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Netflix. The streaming quality is excellent using my Wi-Fi, granted it will vary depending on the internet speed, mine is pretty good. It was very easy to set up and is easy to use, I don't use the remote that came with the Fire Stick, I use my Harmony universal remote and it works great. I also have not tried the voice controls, since I don't use the remote, which is needed to use the voice control. But other people I know use it and they say it works very well. I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a streaming device to use with just about any streaming product!",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. I had an older version of the Fire TV, and I was tired of switching remotes to control the volume. With this new device, you can also control the volume with the remote. This new device does an excellent job of receiving the WIFi signal. My older device was plugged directly into my router, but this new one performs perfectly well with the WiFi connection, maybe even faster, if that’s possible. Also, the set up was extremely easy. I did have to enter passwords for Netflix and another app, but that was easy too. One more thing: the streaming resolution seems to be much better than the old device, as well; and even better than my cable service. Fantastic!",5,1,2018-11-25,1,1,0
"Several months ago, we started having issues streaming Hulu on our 3yo Vizio TV and had been getting around it by Chromecasting it from my Android phone, but it wasn't the best experience.  Looking around for some options and the Fire Stick had great reviews and I was able to get early Black Friday pricing that took 50% off, so figured it was worth a shot.  The setup for all of our streaming services was very easy and so far all is working well.  Love that we now can stream Hulu again as well as get to use individual profiles, which Hulu had implemented a while ago, but our Vizio TV app didn't support.  The remote is easy to use and we really like the fact that we can use it to control the volume on our TV as well.  While we've only used the voice recognition a few times, it's worked well and is another great feature.  Wish we'd done this awhile back!",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"However...... I used to be able to view and manage my ""other"" 3 older Fire TV sticks, but this is no longer available.

And alexa has NEVER understood a single search for me - hence not a 5 star rating.  I don't know am I too well spoken (trained by Mountain Bell with a University degree)??

The remote is simple and works well. I bought the ethernet adapter too since I already have a network cable at my tv that I can use for the network connection. Voice recognition is generally good. I haven't figured out or even looked into how to get Alexa to recognize numbers as numbers instead of text but I'm sure there's a way. Generally very happy with this device. Also it comes with a short malexfemale hdmi cable so that the stick does not have to stick straight out of your TV.

"I don't want to praise all the achievement of Fire TV 4K (you can find plenty of them here) and want to go straight to the issues that I'm experiencing. So here are the main cons of Fire TV 4K:1) Doesn't support Vudu. AND IT IS A BIG ISSUE!!!! There are tons of reviews here about the absence of Vudu, but still ZERO reaction from Amazon team that is responsible for Fire TVs. I don't even know how many more reviews should be posted pointing this very problem before they open their gates. Please Amazon comment how many more reviews should be posted before you seriously start thinking about it? And why on earth Vudu? After all, Vudu is supported by every competitor: Chromecast, Roku and even Apple TV! C'mon Amazon, don't be evil and greedy and add that Vudu app to your list of supported services. I KNOW that Vudu can be sideloaded (there are plenty tutorials on YouTube) BUT we need something that works out of the box. What is the point of having thousands of ""mostly useless"" supported apps when you do NOT support the app that is used by millions (According to Variety, there are 25 million Vudu users here in US).",3,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

I was looking at Apple TV at Best Buy but the sales person said the Apple wouldn’t  solve my streaming problem with WiFi and it cost a lot more than the Fire Stick.

"*update* really, Amazon? Just read all the 1 star reviews and the majority say the same thing. Fix your product and stop sending refurbished replacements when we initially bought a brand new stick. Who does that?! I gave up and bought a Roku. Couldn't be happier.Firestick stopped working after a few weeks. Then, they sent me a refurbished replacement instead of another new one. It quit working after a week. Long story short, I initially bought it at 50% off. When they tried to rectify the situation after I requested a refund, they would only give me a 15% discount on a new one instead of the 50% I initially had. Really? I'm returning 2 faulty devices within a month. You think I'm going to pay more for the chance at another faulty device? Nope. I also had to return my 1st voice activated remote firestick because it stopped working within the 1st week. So that's 3 returned firestick devices.

It is nice being able to speak into the microphone instead of scrolling and typing characters. Some apps don't work well, BlazeTV has HORRIBLE audio lag behind the video that drives me up the wall and makes it almost unwatchable. If you are a conspiracy theorist you might suspect amazon could purposefully sabotage a conservative app platform, I am not sure myself but it is disappointing since that was my main reason to get the fire stick. Our smartTV already had netfix and hulu built in.Its pretty good otherwise, nice to be able to use our echo to give voice commands to play and pause video and all that.

"I bought this to hook up to a projector and I'm just so amazed on how clear the image is. I bought the original Fire TV Stick when it came out and it was pretty good for the time being but I can't believe how much better the quality this 4k Fire TV Stick is. For the best results though it's really going to depend on your TV and/or projector that you use. For an example, my projector is a 4k projector so it's really compatible with this Fire TV Stick.The voice recognition isn't 100% but to be fair, I really don't think there is a product out there that can be 100% all of the time, also I honestly find it easier to just use the remote like a regular remote to find things. Otherwise it seems like it keeps searching and finding things that cost money. For an example, if I ask it to play a movie it will go through Amazon's catalog and pull up the movie to rent or buy instead of searching for the movie on Netflix or another streaming service.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0

This went on sale during Prime Week (and will again during Black Friday Week) so how could I refuse?The 4K content support is wonderful. Everything looks better.

"The device is pretty snappy in terms of performance. I haven't used it for 4k as I don't have a 4k tv, but with HD content there was no stuttering or delays.  I like that I could turn my soundbar on and off and control the volume with the remote. A major competitor wouldn't do this.There are two annoying things.  One is that the ads/""featured content"" are above every other app.  Everytime you go back to the home screen you need to scroll down to whatever apps you use.  The second thing which sort of ties into the first thing is that if I pause a show (like doorbell rings, need to run an errand or whatever), it bring you back to the home screen where you have to go back through the ads to get back to restart the app you were using. This happens after a short period (maybe 10-15 minutes).  This seems to be so you can see more ads.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

Cost to replace 1st gen remote vs cost to upgrade to the Fire Stick with a remote was only about $20 more so I went with the Fire Stick. I have a 2006 Sony TV with an older style HDMI port, so I was happy the Fire Stick package included an adapter. Set up was very easy and quick.  So far, the Stick performs as well as the old box did (I do use the booster cable that came with). I was concerned about the remote being able to communicate with the Stick as my TV's HMDI port is in the back, but that has not been an issue.

"I had high hopes for the Amazon Firesticks and I have to say I own four of them including the latest 4K version.

It seemed worse on live sporting events and it seemed to be at the most inopportune times, like bases loaded 3-2 count and pitcher just about to deliver the ball. For the longest time I had assumed this was either due to my internet service of PlayStation Vue. On Black Friday I came across a great sale on the Roku Ultra device and decided to try it. To my pleasant surprise I have been watching for over a week and have not had a single freeze with the Roku Ultra.So to be fair the Roku Ultra is not a stick but a small box but if you want to watch tv over the internet with quality similar to cable the difference is pretty meaningless.

It certainly works, BUT there are settings that should be made permanent until changed ( persistent is the term ) like subtitles ( yes/no) .  The same VLC app works just fine on my Nvidea Shield .  Other options in the settings of the firestick and apps, are also not persistent and revert to default on the next session.  That's irritating, so the firestick has been relegated to the seldom used guestroom TV, and is secondary to a Roku box .  Occasionally some file format will not be supported by the Roku, and a secondary VLC unit is necessary to play that particular file.  The Roku series has the best remotes of the current media players, and the Shield/VLC combo has the best file format compatibility.  VLC is amazing .",3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"When it's working, it works very well; good, solid stream with no stuttering. Excellent audio and video quality.

As with many other users, I have entirely too many connection issues, even though my inexpensive Motorola phone remains connected, with no problems. The problem is intermittent, and I'm able to - sometimes - watch an entire show, or evening of shows...but, all too often, I need to restart the Firestick, several times, before it finally allows me to watch anything. I've seen possible fixes, including longer cable between Firestick and TV, and mounting the Firestick vertically...none of which *should* be required. At this point, I'm not at all pleased with my purchase, and am considering replacing it with a Roku stick.Later edit...too many issues, constantly ""losing network connection,"" constantly telling me there is no internet connection.

We don’t use Alexa much, but it’s worked fine for the few times I’ve used it, mainly to look for shows. Thought it was cool that I could use Alexa to rewind video, on some apps. Only gave four out of five stars because haven’t really had it long enough to rate it higher. There have been times when the remote stopped working and I had to unplug/plug in the Fire TV Stick to get it to work...seems to be a bit glitchy, but not too bad.

Having done my research online and not finding any complaints or answers and troubleshooting with samsung, I know it is not my TV because I have watched the same stuff directly through my TV and it looks great, no video issues at all, crystal clear.  I thought I finally figured out that the problem was not the stick itself but the piece of junk extension that comes with the stick. As a matter of fact I had replaced the stick (and the extension, just in case) thinking it was either the stick or possibly my HDMI port, until narrowing it down to that piece just yesterday. I was glad after 3 weeks that I finally tried it without and it looked so much better! I thought the problem was totally gone. But after watching for several hours, lo and behold, the shadowing/ flickering has reared it's evil head again. 😐 Amazon, you really need to work on that extension. But I fear that is not the only problem. It definitely exacerbates the problem, but the problem still exists in the stick itself. 😐  I will be keeping it, but only because I need it for the space and because some apps don't run well on my older samsung. The quality just is not up to par. 😕  I really hope they work on fixing the glitches in the stick and especially in the extension, if you can run the stick without it, I highly recommend it.  It really takes away from the quality.",2,1,2019-6-15,1,1,0
"We really loved our firestick at first. Love that all of our apps, etc are in one place! But after just a couple of months we’ve started having issues with the Alexa/voice integration. For some reason if we use the voice to search something it switches our whole TV to a different source and is no longer on the fire tv. It doesn’t do it if we type in our search, only when we use the voice control. Also, it sometimes has issues connecting to our wifi. Our actual tv will be connected and have great service but our fire stick won’t connect. So for those reasons, we’re really not satisfied and that makes me so sad because we were SO excited to get the firestick. We also had one instance when it seemed like everything was in chipmunk voice and going really fast. I was able to reset it and get that off but it was weird and just one other issue we had. I just feel like I’m always having to try to reset it, unplug it, etc because something isn’t working.",2,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
This is my third 4k version of the stick. One I bought for a friend and the other 2 were for me. My favorite was the old fire tv box that's been discontinued. But it died in a lightning storm so I traded it in for this version.My current purchase was to replace one of the first firesticks. I'm using it on an older tv. The upgrade of adding the power and volume buttons on the remote convinced me to replace the older firestick.,5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I love the FireStick 4K. I got one for each of my televisions. I got these to cut the cord from DirecTV. I really enjoy the wide variety of programs available. Between my Prime membership, Netflix and YouTube TV, I have everything I watch at a fraction of the cost of my DTV Service. The one thing I miss is being able to view the guide while still watching the program I am in. It's a small thing and I can work with the way the FireStick does it's guide, but it is just a little irritating to only be able to see what is currently on other channels. I like being able to see further into the future. Also, the DTV guide went out 14 days, not so with the FireStick. Other than that, I would recommend this product very highly. The quality is fantastic and the choices are awesome.",4,1,2019-6-6,1,1,0
I am in love with this Fire Stick Tv with Alexa.  It was easy to set up and everything I needed was included in the package.  I am using it on a large smart tv with 1080 psi.  The quality of the picture and sound is superb.  Alexa worked like a miracle as well.  I have very slow internet service and it is my only option at this time.  As result it causes buffering usually  3 to 5 times on a more current movie.  I watched two current movies with the fire stick during the afternoon and had zero problems with buffering.  I tried to watch a current movie[probably 1080 psi] during the hours of 7 to 10 PM and with the fire stick had buffering.  I switched movies to an older movie [probably 720] during this time and with the fire stick had no problems.  These are peak hours for the internet and due to what I suspect is max usage of internet at these times  affected the buffering.  I will consider buying more Fire Sticks 4 K with Alexa for other TV's in my home.  JM,5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"We had standard Fire TV Sticks and subsequently signed up for YouTubeTV service.  Unfortunately, they would not stream it in 1080p HD, even though we have very robust 200 Mbps broadband that consistently tests 230+ Mbps.  After working with YouTubeTV tech support at length, we decided to try a Fire TV Stick 4K.  We found it *would* stream YouTubeTV in HD and appears to have a better receiver because it consistently tests over 150 Mbps down.  (Our wireless router is AC2600-class.)  Things have gone well since then except the Fire TV Stick 4K periodically gets cranky and we find it's about out of memory.  To fix it we just clear the cache on all apps and manually restart.  Bottom Line:  It's a very good streaming device, with a great selection of apps, but really needs 16 GB of memory instead of 8 GB, unless your app collection is skinny.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

"I've always liked fireTv's since they have access to just about every app, they're inexpensive, have a decent UI, and typically feel pretty snappy (as long as they're less than 2 years old). Well this version is by far the snappiest and now that you can turn your TV on and control the volume I feel like this is the perfect streaming stick. It's the only remote we use now and it feels great not to have 2 remotes laying around constantly. Setup was incredibly easy I just plugged it into the TV and it asked me to test the power and volume buttons and they just magically worked. I'm honestly looking forward to a few of my older FireTv sticks to start slowing down so I can replace them with this newer version. Never thought I would say that.",5,1,2018-12-14,1,1,0

"I bought this stick with the fire recast for my new living room TV with all the bells and whistles. The stick is about 5 feet from my wireless router in direct line of sight and yet it keeps buffering and the picture gets very pixelated. So much for HDR, 4K etc... I have a fire TV 4k and a regular fire stick in two different bedrooms, farther away from the router and no L.O.S. and they work flawlessly. I had to force my router to a single 20MHz carrier on channel 165 in the 5GHz band where there's no interference from neighbors so that the stick is useable, but it still buffers and pixelates though not as bad. I read an article online where it says it's a known bug but no expected timeframe for a solution. Well Amazon what are you waiting for to fix it? You're selling the recast with this device in a bundle knowing that it works like s%$t?!?! I'm seriously thinking about returning it and getting another fire TV 4k (not the stick) but then I'd be stuck with the old remote. I just can't win I guess. Please let us poor consumers know when the fix is coming. I'll update my review once it's fixed unless I just end up returning it.EDIT: shortly after I wrote this review I was contacted by Amazon by phone to provide technical support and try and solve my issues. I find that very nice customer support however they were unable to solve anything at all. Disturbingly, they claimed Amazon was not aware of any bug. After a few more days with the stick 4K I've noticed that my issues are mostly using it with my fire recast. That's where I'm noticing the buffering and the low quality picture. I think I'm getting 480p at most when HD channels are supposed to be re-encoded to 720p. But very often quality drops well below that, so bad that you can see big square pixels everywhere. And again my other two fire devices work flawlessly, and the difference in picture quality is night and day. I'm no longer sure the issue has anything to do with WiFi performance at all. If you're using fire recast or plan on getting one, DO NOT BUY the fire stick 4K to go with it. There's something going on between the two of them and they just do not work well together at all. I can't believe Amazon is bundling them together, really?! Keeping one star and repeat DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON GETTING A RECAST.",3,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0

It took me awhile to move into my house to set up the Fire Stick again (November 2019). It worked fine after getting it on my new wifi. When I tried to use it later , I got a black screen. I tried the unplugging/plugging of the power and HDMI cables. Nothing. I used my four year old ROKU 2 to look up troubleshooting on YouTube.

Although the quality was good, it wasn't as good as when we first received the first one.  When Prime Day rolled around, I ordered 3 new 4K to replace the non-4K Fire Sticks we had on our other TVs.  I had my husband hook one of the brand new ones up onto the TV with the refurbished  Fire Stick: we are back to the sharper picture.  In addition, we have non 4K TVs that we hooked the other 2 new Fire Sticks up to.  Great pictures on both.

"I've heard about the Fire Stick and the Roku for a few years now, but always assumed that the set-up would be difficult and it didn't matter if I had access to my different streaming accounts scattered on several different devices. HOLY CRAP I was wrong. I settled on the Fire Stick because it provided access to Amazon Prime Video, something I was only able to access through our Blu-Ray player. That was a slow, complicated process that made me never want to watch Amazon Prime.Plugging in the Fire Stick and connecting the remote took about 30 seconds. The actual setting up of all my accounts took about an hour, with the verifying of info through my cable company, finding my passwords, etc. Once everything was set up, I literally just push the mic button and say, ""Alexa, play ......."" and boom, there it is, on my TV. Some of my other streaming services (Netflix and Hulu) sometimes have glitches that prevent loading or slow loading of content.

"Great product and works as advertised.  I did have one experience that I thought I would share, however.I have the firestick attached to a very high end Denon receiver. When the batteries got low in the remote, the firestick somehow would trigger the Denon to automatically raise the volume to full level (which thankfully did not damage my speakers, but came close). It did this several times. I even moved the firestick to another Denon receiver and it did the same thing. I then received a firestick remote low battery message and I put in new batteries in the firestick. Then the problem went away!  Because this could have damaged my speakers, I thought I would pass this knowledge along to help someone else. Moral of the story is low remote batteries can trigger strange runaway volume on receiver. So, when your firestick remote batteries get low replace them right away!  Or, when you get the runaway volume problem, shut down your equipment immediately and change your firestick remote batteries.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

The WiFi sensitivity could be better; it's noticeably weaker than my Blu-ray player which Amazon chose to obsolete for receiving their stream...really unclear why they did this!!!  Navigation of the screen is awkward to say the least.  Part of the problem is the remote which is a disaster!!!  First of all It takes a lot of patience to figure out what buttons control what.  Seems pretty non-standard compared to the millions of other remotes I have used.  Also, it is mechanically poor.  The round navigation button it already failing and makes the wrong choices unless you are VERY careful pushing it.  Very annoyingly, it turns off my TV when I push the power button!!!

Half an hour later, after feeling like the rep was listening to me and having me jump through a bunch of useless hoops, the problem was not resolved.  So, I  resolved to return and just get another one.  With the second I made it through the set up with no problems, but it still reboots spontaneously.  It seems to happen more with apps like Hulu and Netflix.  I  dread returning it because I know  I'll only get a partial refund.  That's what happened with the first one and I had to point out to the customer service rep that I returned a defective unit and had already purchased a replacement. Afterwards, I got a full refund.

For example when someone is speaking a language other than English, the show adds the English translation to the bottom of the screen. But the Fire TV subtitle (usually says ""speaks in xxx language"") covers it. So I have to pause, rewind, shut off subtitles, replay so I can see what was actually said, and then turn subtitles back on.

My problem is, I power mine via USB through my TV, so it shuts off with the TV and doesn't waste data.  After about 2 days it began constantly restarting itself over and over.  I tried a more heavy duty USB (not sure why Firestick doesn't just come with a more sufficient USB power supply).  This mostly solved the issue but occasionally it still randomly restarts when i switch from one stream to another or pause and come back.

"I bought 3 4K firesticks last summer. I think it was August but may have been September. 2 of them get used daily and 1 is in the basement so it gets used intermittently. The two that see daily use are almost useless most of the time. The remote is the worst part. It often just decides it doesn't want to work and until you curse it, beat it and bang it around it will not work. About once a week the firesticks themselves will freeze up and not work so you'll have to do a reset. I payed almost $50 each for these and really expected to get more use out of them. They have nexer been ""jailbroke"" and are not even close to full of apps. We literally watch netflix, hulu and a couple of childrens apps so the issue is not user created. Meanwhile the tv remote at my parents house is around a decade old and still works like a champ. Maybe the Amazon engineers could go do an internship? The county EMS bases I work at all have the older ROKU boxes that are a few years old at least. They all see daily extensive use and all still work great.

It also has replaced my long standing loyalty to the Apple TV device which continues to be so expensive for essentially the same technology, unless you have more advanced requirements (I only know about this from reading professional side by side reviews.). I can now truly use the world of streaming cafeteria style and not be indentured to anybody's proprietary greed.  There is so much content available nowadays no one provider has cornered the material on winning offers, and by the way, HBO, why are you stilling drip dripping your specials???",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I bought this fire stick mainly to play my m3u playlist through the IPTV apps and also for the youtube and to download some games to enjoy it with the kids. I do like the shape and the idea of the stick as it takes no space just attached through the adapter to the back of the TV and even the power cable I attach to the TV USB 5 volts outlet so it's really perfect at this aspect. Also, the other great feature is the remote that controls the TV volume and powering it on and off! I am using it with a non -smart tv and now with a Roku one and it controlled both (at the Roku I need to choose the HDMI input first). and regarding the games, I'm enjoying the car racing game which is for free and it was easy to pair a game controller using blue tooth. The bad about it is the limited memory so I won't be able to download more apps and the indirect process to download apps such as Kodi or IPTV player apps using the downloader. Overall, it's a great choice regarding performance and HDR 4K picture but the memory and apps need to be enhanced .",4,1,2019-6-1,1,0,0
"I bought a Fire Stick before they had the voice recognition feature. I liked it. I like Amazon Prime and I'm hoping someday to dump cable and just use Amazon, but I'm not ready to cut the cord quite yet.  Anyway one of the inconvenient features of the old Fire Stick was wearing my thumbs out trying to perform a search. The voice recognition on this product is pretty good. It has made using Amazon Prime much easier than it was before. The stream quality seems pretty good, but it is hard for me to judge because I really don't have anything to compare it to.",5,1,2019-5-31,1,1,0

"I couldn't be happier with my fire sticks. I bought two one for my bedroom and one for my living room TV. They were so easy to install nothing complicated and easy to maneuver. I find that there are many many free shows that I have thoroughly enjoyed so far. I have not purchased any apps. But probably will in the near future so I can receive local channels and CBS, and MSNBC. I can truly say those are the only things that I really miss. There is such a wide variety of jonra available to watch for free. There is no buffering it works just exactly like it said it's supposed to CARiD I am extremely happy and would strongly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in cutting the cord.

"I highly recommend this product at $35 or $30 each when you buy two (as the sale is set for today, 12/8, 2018). I bought two of the 2nd gen. Fire TV sticks (gave one away as a gift) and I bought the Fire TV [Square Box, the one with an ethernet jack]. This 4K Fire TV stick is the truth, especially at only $35. I didn't buy mine from Amazon. I bought it from Best Buy on Black Friday because I got other deals for buying a bunch of stuff from there at the same time. $50 is a bit much but $35 works! The product works very well. Watch a YouTube video about how to make it work as fast as possible. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime, this product is excellent for you! If you have a 4K TV, even better! ...although a 1080p TV will do just fine too. With the new remote control that operates your TV's power and volume, this 4K Fire TV stick is really awesome! It's convenient, light-weight (you can take it with you if you're on the go), and it's pretty fast! It also includes the ethernet jack on the power cable. That was such a good idea. If you don't already have any of the older ones, pick up two of these today at $30 each! Can't beat it. I know I almost sound like a commercial for Amazon.com right now. But I'm just a regular dude. I buy lots of stuff from Amazon; some stuff I like, some stuff I don't like. I bought the new Echo Show too and I think it's just okay. I only added that line to prove I'm not working for Amazon. Haha. Anyway, hope this was helpful to somebody. Peace.",5,1,2018-12-8,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like this because it would allow me to get DolbyVision. I'll give background on my setup: FTV stick plugged into an enhanced port on Denon S730h AVR running a premium certified cable to HDMI2 on Sony x900f TV. I also have a Roku Ultra 4640 plugged into a port on the AVR through the same path to the Sony TV. It works great, only no DolbyVision. I noticed the longer I let the FTV run the worse it  'seemed' to flash black screens with sometimes  random white portions of the screen. I swapped the FTV stick with the Ultra's port on the AVR and it did the same thing. I contacted Amazon support and they sent me a replacement device to see if it was a bad unit. The new one did the same thing. So I have to believe there is some compatibility issue with FTV stick and my setup. Sometimes I can get all the way through a movie with no flashing other times it will flash 5 or 6 flashes in  the period of a movie. Others seem to have no problems with the device so once again there must be something that the FTV stick doesn't like about my setup. Beware other Denon/Sony users.",2,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"I've had many Fire Sticks over the years, and have really enjoyed how they keep getting better and better. This one is no different. This is my first Fire Stick to have the integrated power button to control the TV, and I absolutely love this feature.I had been holding out on getting a Fire Stick for our family room, instead relying on our PS4 for all of our streaming services, including PS Vue. I finally caved on Black Friday, and got this stick. Ironically I feel like PS Vue works even better on the Fire Stick than the PS4 (but too bad it's being cancelled anyway!). The seamless integration with my entertainment system is fantastic. One power button and I turn everything off, instead of having to turn off the PS4 in its menu and then power down TV and receiver.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"Upgraded from a 1st gen stick, even though I have a 1080p screen I figured the 4k capability would be future proof and also have more CPU power for smooth menu use.  I also ordered this with an ethernet adapter.  This is a huge improvement over the original stick. I was surprised that the remote was able to be programmed to my Logitech z5500 computer speaker system. I can turn the volume up and down on it as well as turn off the speakers and TV simultaneously with the power button on the amazon remote.  WOW!Menu interaction and video loading are smooth with no delay. I'm very impressed. I will be getting another one of these for sure to replace my OG Fire TV Box on my other TV.

"Upgraded from the previous Amazon Fire TV stick to this new 4K version. Love the remote! It learned how to control the TV and soundbar...power on/off with one button. Win! That was for my bedroom system. I bought a SECOND 4K Fire Stick for the living room. The remote did NOT recognize my Harmon Kardon 3490 stereo receiver. Tried to connect for an hour...didn't play well. So, am using that 4K Fire Stick for my mancave (garage) system. It quickly recognized my Yamaha A/V receiver and works flawlessly! Again, one button to turn on/off and volume control. Badassy! I have two Amazon Echo's and for the life of me, can NOT link the new Fire's to my Echos (using the Echo APP, watched videos on how to do it...nothing is working). Kinda bummed about that...but, not a deal breaker. As for the new 4K compared to the earlier versions...snappier performance, video looks ""a little better"", and it has much more intuitive adjustment screens...well thought out. Worth the money. I did buy the $15 Amazon Ethernet adapter for hard wiring a Cat 6 cable to the Fire TV Stick...turns out I really didn't need it since my home WIFI is excellent. Oh well.",5,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
i have a 4k UHD samsung 75 in T.V with a Samsung sound bar (Bluetooth). this Amazon FireTV 4k gets me no sound. i trouble shooted it myself. nothing still sound. i disconnected my surround sound bar system to see that was the issue. nope still no sound. i dont think this device is 4k UHD compatible to samasung. even if it worked without my sound bar. i would give this device a bad rating. how doesnt want a theater experience. the device does work with a none 4k T.V tho. i get sound and works better.  to me this is False advertisement. All tho i am currently working with the Amazon FireTV developers on this issue. very nice people and know how to keep in communication. Hopefully we can fix this problem. it would suck if i wont be able to use my sound bar surround system. if i cant use it the way i would like will be sending this product back to Amazon. if you have a none 4k TV it works Great. no its not my HDMI ports i checked them they all work. just doesnt work correctly with the (4k amazon fireTV with Alexa device). Alexa doesnt work right either even with the regular flat screen TV. i think this device is way over valued should be sold no more than 15 dollars. if we can fix this device to work how it should with my sound bar. than yea this device should be sold no less than 70 dollars. which in current price is under valued. will update if the amazon developers and i can resolve this issue. sure hope so. Stand by for update. im sure we can fix this issue. still thoK. So they didnt call me back. I haf to reach out to them after the 48 HR wait. They couldnt fix it. So this product doesnt work on my my 4k T.V.  way over valued should be 10 to 15 dollars. Not 50.,2,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0

"I bought this thinking it was a simple upgrade to streaming 4k for my projector in my living room. I wanted to be able to simply plug it into the HDMI port and stream shows onto the wall as my old Chromecast did. It half worked. The video worked flawlessly but the audio was a huge problem, as in there isn't any. The projector has built in speakers and also has an audio out port on it as well to connect to a receiver. No matter what I tried, internal or external speakers, there was no audio at all. I gave up on the projector use for the Amazon Fire Stick and wend back to the old chromecast that worked perfectly but was only 1080p rather than 4k. 1080p with audio is still far better than 4k with no sound. Now my son uses the Fire Stick on the TV in his room. It works fine when plugged into a TV and he loves it.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
I have 5 Rokus.  Two of them are the 4K versions.  The picture plays well.  But I have to admit the 4K Fire Stick plays better than my 4K Roku.  I think Roku's menu and ease of use has a slight edge over the Fire Stick.  But the Fire Stick has alexa capabilities.I have ordered 4 of the 4K Fire Sticks and I am pleased and impressed.  The major improvement of the 4K Fire Stick is the the AC adapter.  The AC adapter gives the device more power to stream adequately.  The previous fire stick just relied on the TV power when you plugged it into the HDMI or USB port.  Those ports are low power consumption and basically limited the power and capabilities of the fire stick.,5,1,2018-11-27,1,0,0
"Great device. I had the older first generation Fire Stick. I used the old one for many years and it made my smart tv even smarter. But this new 4K fire stick is a must buy. I checked the price of my old one vs this new one and the price hasn't changed except now it's 4K but loads apps super fast and if you have a 4K TV then its a no brainer to buy this one. The interface is similar to the old one so you won't have to adjust your way of using your old one. If you own a smartphone you can download the fire app and use the smartphone to control the firestick. If you need to type something, you can use your smartphone to type in instead of clicking the one letter at a time which is a pain.

Much faster than my original fire stick. More options. Free apps to download.  I also ordered the HDMI extension and LOVE it. I’ll  install the old stick on a tv I have on my porch that I use only in the warmer months. Would have given a 5 star review but the remote is very difficult to open. I enjoy the Prime Movies. Got hooked on The Marvelous Mrs Maisel last year. Already binged on the new episodes a few weeks ago and ready for next years episodes. Haha. Great when my Directv goes out as it does at times — just have to use my Amazon fire tv stick !!!! I don’t have to miss episodes of my favorite soaps because they were interrupted by “Special News Reports” that cut out parts and sometimes my whole program. I just watch what I missed on Amazon.

"This Fire TV stick 4K version has replaced my Apple TV 4th-Gen. I never really liked the remote for my Apple TV as I prefer the raised navigation button that you get with the Fire Stick remote. I use it mainly for TV show and movie streaming through PlayStation Vue, Netflix, and Prime Video. Hands down the best feature is with the new remote that comes in the box. I no longer have to have to use three remotes to control the TV power, volume control for my A/V receiver, and of course the remote for the Fire Stick. When I press the power button on the Fire TV remote, it powers on/off my television and A/V receiver. Using the Fire TV remote, I can now control the volume and mute instead of using the remote that originally came with my A/V receiver.

This Amazon product rocks my world. I'm old school 55 years old. Got the Roku all through the house and several different types. Probably going to get a 4K TV in the next few weeks. Whith this Amazon fire stick and a 5 gigabit internet hookup there is no lag time. Fire stick menu is a rich environment. So many things to watch live channels just like cable. I've had this thing for 3 or 4 days and I still haven't hit the bottom menu yet. I just can't say how much this changes my television experience.

I accidentally clicked on an Amazon prime movie and, presto, I got an email the next day that I was signed up for Amazon prime at 15 bucks a month or something like that. That kind of made me mad. There was no warning or anything like that. Amazon should warn you that you’re about to subscribe to something. But they don’t kind of sneaky. Kynette scammy. But I like the fire stick. I just never open anything that has Amazon on it when I’m using.

If either Amazon or AT&T must use the Fire TV Stick, there should be the ability for the apps to use Alexa.I have a partner that is visually challenged and I have already set up the Fire Stick Accessibility Function. The issue with that is the TV talks to you, which is great but when in a particular program, talks for 10-15 seconds after you are in the program, causing missed dialog.

Probably when the stick was designed there were not so many apps around but now they add every day a new Amazon app and I have only 1.5 Gig available. Many of those apps you can't even uninstall (why would I need a Game Circle or Amazon Free Time) ,with memory so limited at least give me the chance to get rid of them if I don't need it. Wish I could see an app to clear all the cache and data, in order to recover precious space, I have to do it every time app by app. I count to see the next version with some of these and others improvements or I will rather buy one of those cheaper android TV devices  to regain the freedom to install on my device what I want !",4,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Our Smart TV came with build in apps for media streaming and I thought I will never needing a media streaming device. But not all the platforms are supported and so we decided to buy this fire stick.For weeks of using it, I’m so impressed with its  features and resolution. It is easy to install and set up. It came with HDMI extender which is very useful for me. It has a voice control which help me search fast and I do not need to type up. The remote is synchronized with the TV and the sound bar. With just one click, the power will turn on and off. The connection is fast and I don’t experience any lag.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

However, now it won't connect at all, giving me an error message, but does not tell me what the error is. Trying to find a phone number to call for catch support had been equally challenging.

"So I bought this roughly 8 months ago as of this review. It is used on a projector in our playroom on a movie style screen. I didn’t install it for 2 months while projector hardware was being set up. After that it was used maybe 3-4 times a week, relatively low use. Today after 6 months of light use the remote has stopped working. I am able to still use the fire stick functions since I downloaded the app and have other Amazon smart products in our home, but the remote which we use in the place of a traditional TV remote no longer works. I’ve tried 3 sets of batteries (Amazon basics, Duracell) and unplugged it and reset it. Just can’t get it to work.I like the product but disappointed that the remote barely lasted 6 months of light use. It wasn’t dropped or left outside or anything negligent, just stopped working.",3,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"After the initial setup, which was quite easy, this device works better than expected. I purchased this device to replace my $179 Apple TV box. The Apple kept dropping the internet signal too many times while watching a movie. I know it's not my internet connection but the Apple device. I have my iPad next to me when the Apple TV drops the signal and it stays connected to the internet. That proves that the Apple TV is dropping the connection and not my router. This problem is all over the internet. At a fraction of the Apple price this device is far superior. With the Apple I had to unplug it, wait 30 seconds, and plug it in again and hope it stays connected. After a while this gets annoying. The Fire Stick has eliminated this problem for now. I hope it continues to work this way. So far so good.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0

Still it looks better than any of the other devices.The main screen is a bit busy compared to the Roku, but I guess I will get used to it. My Roku is an older version, but it is 1080p.

With this device I now see a noticeable upgrade in performance with how snappy it is in comparison to the two previous devices I was using.There were audio dropouts which were quite annoying but that seems to have been fixed in an OS update. The remote is really nice in that it powers on my HDTV and AV Receiver, as well as works the volume for both.

The hardest part was getting the cover off the fire stick remote to install the two batteries (which Amazon kindly included).  The onscreen set up took another minute.  Seriously, it was so simple, it was scary.  In less than five minutes, we were streaming movies with the Fire Stick on our ten year old non-Smart Sony TV.And using Alexa is a breeze.  Want to see the movie “Some Like It Hot”?  Just press the microphone button on the remote, and say the title.  Want to see what Marilyn Monroe movies are available?

The menus are more responsive and best of all, using VLC, I can stream movies stored on my NAS without any issues.  The streaming quality is good.  I've also noticed fewer problems with wireless connection quality.There are a couple things I don't like.  First I think the menu navigation is not very intuitive.  Second, any apps you launch are still running in the background if you launch another app.  This is a pain because you find yourself having to shut them all down manually.  Each time you exit one, you end up back at the previous instead of at the main menu.",4,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"Bought this because my LG Plasma TV is pre-2015, so the built-in Smart TV feature doesn't work with YouTube TV, and I am changing from DISH satellite service to YouTube TV streaming service......I immediately found that ALL of my streaming is faster AND clearer using the Fire TV Stick.  The remote for the Fire Stick controls the streaming services AND the Amazon brand soundbar I bought previously....so, I only need one remote to control everything.....If I had known how much the Fire TV Stick would improve both streaming and basic TV control, I would have bought this a long time ago!  ALEXA is active only when pressing the ALEXA button on the remote, which is nice....I don't want my remote control eavesdropping on my conversations, and using ALEXA to switch between streaming services is v. handy.",5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
"Fire Stick stopped connecting to the internet at 4- months time.  Contacted Amazon’s India-based customer service who kept me waiting on hold over and over again for more than 45 minutes kept reading the same script over and over and over again.  Told me to pack up equipment in original box and they sent a return label.  Refurbished fire stick arrived wrapped in plastic, no remote, no box identifying the Serial # which is not on the fire stick.  So another call to the India-based customer service rep reading her script and telling me that the previous rep and supervisor should have told me to only send the fire stick back and not the remote, paperwork, etc.  So extremely frustrating.  This is an Amazon product needed to access their streaming service and its not made well enough to work for the year that it is warranted for and the support service based in India is a J O K E.

"I now love my Fire Stick! At first I had a bit of trouble with it. It would suddenly stop in the middle of the movie I was watching and tell my I wasn’t connected to my wi fi when I was. I had to check each and every time and check all connections and not a thing was wrong with any of them. This would go on for 10-15 minutes during my movie. I would finally get it going, don’t ask me how, but my movie would start up again. This happened about 4 times. I thought I would have to send it back. But after the last time it hasn’t happened again. I now don’t have one single issue with my Fire Stick! I love it!! The voice command (Alexa) is awesome!! I somehow got into the shopping list one time, I don’t know how I did it but it was easy enough to get out of. I guess the more I use the more I will learn about my Fire Stick! But after the initial set backs, I just love it so much!!! I just started using it right out of the box without reading anything. I don’t remember if instructions came with it or not. That was my mistake. You need to learn your Fire Stick by using it.",5,1,2019-2-6,1,0,0

It does most things well, but as many other reviewers have noted, the remote equipment control was only partially implemented and what does work is also intermittent.  Amazon's oversights in this regard, and their support stubbornness make the experience very limited.If you're familiar with CEC equipment control, you know it's supposed to allow any device that supports CEC to receive and send remote control commands over the HDMI cable.

"Very happy with new Fire TV Stick 4K.  We have a 55"" standard Samsung HD 1080i TV.  We had a Amazon Fire TV box (using it Wi-Fi) for streaming but it would sometimes freeze temporarily for a short time or streaming would be delayed sporadically multiple times.  It was very frustrating because 90% of the time things were perfect and other times it was a constant problem.  Since installing the new Fire TV Stick 4K on the same HD 1080i TV (using only Wi-Fi set up) there has been absolutely no delays, no temporary freeze ups or problems what so ever!  In fact streaming seems faster and completely seamless now.  We have also noticed an Enhanced TV picture, even though this is not a 4K TV, just a standard HD 1080i LED TV.  Would definitely recommend this 4K Fire Stick for non-4K HD TV's as well.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0

"I have become a big fan of Fire TV Sticks. As a result, I gave a few of the 2nd generation units to relatives and friends as gifts. I own one myself and I decided to upgrade to the new 4K one. I’m extremely happy with the image quality and the improved audio capabilities. In fact, I prefer to stream through it rather than from my very expensive Blu-ray player/Media Streamer. I use it in my home cinema with a very good Sony projector that shows all the image flaws and it offers an amazing image. However, this 4K unit does something that my previous unit did not - it sometimes mutes the digital audio output for a second or so. Both units connected to the same system, with a Wi-Fi router directly underneath. No problems whatsoever with the second generation, but this audio glitch with the 4K. I hope that this is something that can be fixed through a firmware update, since it hasn’t been long since this unit came out.

I bought 2 of these with credit card points because my local cable company offers their programing as an app also. It sounded like a good idea because they support 2 devices with HD instead of the one with your cable box plus having to pay more for HD and a second set-top box.The Fire was quite easy to set up.

Generic android and Windows TV sticks were usually slow and buggy, screen mirroring was unreliable, and I got sick of looking at a full size computer/laptop plugged in as well. For $40, being able to stream my local content as well as connect to my Shadow cloud desktop to do everything I'd do on any other computer , this is a great device, and costs less than a Chromebit or buggy and slow Windows Tv sticks.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0
"I like the fact that this plugs into the back of the TV and gets it off of the TV stand. After using this now for a few weeks I have found some problems / complaints that would make it better. 1. Add a channel up / down button so you can fully control your TV and still not need two remotes. 2. Alexa still needs work, give a command to change inputs and you may get a math problem such as 2+2=4, I don't know how to do that or not programed for that function, you may have to ask five or six times before change occurs. 3. Your recents lineup changes at will meaning you will have many multiples of APPs and shows or it may remove them altogether and you will have none, or when you first go to the FIRE TV stick from watching TV the your recents line is not there, you have to scroll down a few lines then back up to the top and then back down to get the recents line to appear. It appears they are tying to force you watch their shows because that is what is in the recents place not your APPs / shows. I don't have a 4K TV so I can't tell any difference in picture quality from the older model FIRE TV boxes. Other than these few things it works about the same as the older boxes.",3,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0

Too bad I have to give this a star. Amazon should be embarrassed that they sell this. It s absolute JUNK. I have to unplug it and plug it back in everyday. If I was not at home my wife and daughter could not watch this TV. It loses the WiFi signal all the time with the WiFi router right next to the stick. I had to take the device apart and drill holes in the plastic case because the unit gets so hot. We all know how well electronics work when they get hot :(.  It has never worked right. Unless you enjoy constantly fixing something and having to subscribe to multiple YouTube channels just to get your Fire Stick to work then get this. My advice spend  your money on the Apple TV. I have two and they are flawless. I have been an Amazon customer since there was an Amazon. I actually have a travel coffee mug they sent me for being one of the first customers.

After about five minutes, the screen goes into screensaver mode, and eventually sleeps.  When you wake it up, it likes to go back to the home page.  What if I want to get some food together?

I don't know if that has anything to do with the improved processor but loading times are few to the point I barely wait for my show to start streaming. The image is also beautiful. I also like this new remote. I can control the TV with only one remote. Kudos!The reason I'm giving it four starts is because I've noticed a line of horizontal dead pixels just above the bottom bezel of the TV. At first I thought my TV was faulty, but I noticed that the line disappears when I'm not streaming through the Fire Stick. It doesn't matter which hdmi port I use; the line is there. I've also noticed that this Fire Stick tends to have problems finding my 5Ghz network at times, or that the signal is ""marginal"" when I know for a fact the network is working properly. When I connect it to the 2.4Ghz network it works great.",4,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"I use the Fire Stick to access my Prime account and also to run the software to access my IPTV account. I was able to cut the cable/cord completely and ditch Direct TV once and for all. Now I can access almost all channels plus having the extensive libraries of movies on Prime and my IPTV. The video quality is great and you'd never know it was streaming. The 4K is a bit glitchy in terms of running other developer's software, but after a while it settled in and I've had now other problems. To give you an idea of the cost savings in cutting the cable; I purchased 3 FireSticks for my TVs. That total wasn't as much as one month's bill from Direct. My IPTV account is $29 per month, plus my prime account charges so I'm saving over a thousand dollars per year, with no scarf in quality or channel choices. Gotta love it!I haven't used the Alexa features yet but the stream quality is great if you have a good high speed provider.

Being that pretty much all 4k TV's made after 2015 support HDCP 2.2 in all HDMI ports, I assume this is more of a software issue.The remote works great. I only use my actual TV remote to switch between sources.

This is honestly, unacceptable. Currently, they are only for other products under the Amazon umbrella (IMDB TV), but it is an ugly direction to be moving in. This isn't supposed to be an ad supported product. People pay for the hardware. People buy content from Amazon. Stop trying to sell me more stuff, you already have all of my money.

"I previously had the Fire TV 4K (pendant design) streaming player, and it was great.  It's biggest drawback was not having volume & power buttons for the TV/soundbar, but I got past that with an add-on Sideclick device.  With this unit recently being on sale, I figured I'd finally upgrade to get the remote with integrated power/volume controls, and I'm really glad I did.  First off, those functions work great, and control the power for both my TV and soundbar, as well as the volume on my Yamaha soundbar.  What I wasn't expecting was the better picture quality.  The Fire TV device was 4K Ultra HD as well, but the new Fire Stick 4K has noticeably better picture quality, especially on 1080 & 4K.  In fact I was wondering if I was imagining things when my wife stated that the picture looked better.  Don't get me wrong, the Fire TV unit looked good, but the new Fire Stick 4K looks even better.

I have a Fire Box and 2 older Fire Sticks. The fire box is much more responsive and faster than the Older sticks and I wanted to replace one with another Fire Box. Unfortunately the Fire box is no longer available. I was hesitant that the performance of the 4K stick would be similar to the older sticks. It's not!! The Fire 4k Stick performs just as well as the Box even though it's smaller in size. It's a great step-up from the older generation sticks. No more lagging and waiting.

"This amazon device does work well. I had no issues with it. However, the selection and move options were.......extremely underwhelming. The base amount of channels and stuff this stick comes with is very very few. And even then, these are shows that you can find in other sites anyway. The only advantage of this stick is having access to the Amazon Originals series and let's be honest.....they aren't THAT interesting to warrant paying over $40 for this thing.You can have access to other shows and stuff but at an additional cost on top of the base price for this thing. There ARE ways to gain access more shows via jailbreaking but that's honestly a lot more hassle than it's worth especially since this device was intended to be used by my older parents who have no idea how technology works.",1,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0

So many free TV options, I wish I had ditched expensive satellite TV years ago! I was told that Roku was pretty much the same, but they ask for lots of personal information and your credit card without allowing you the option of opting out.

"Got this so I could move some of the streaming apps I use with prime and others to different tv's. Not all the tv's have streaming tools, so this is a nice movable option. Seems to work great with my Wi-Fi right out of the box, with no tweaking. My only complaint would be the initial sign up of each app can be time consuming, when using the remote to enter user name and password can be annoying. Luckily I only had to do it once for each.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,2,0
"I’ve had access to Amazon Prime Videos for years but I had a difficult time finding what I wanted to watch. With the Alexa Fire Stick I simply press the microphone button and speak to Alexa telling her what I want to watch. Lo and behold, it appears. If I interrupt my binge watching on a tv season I only have to tell Alexa where I left off. (I also believe that the Fire Stick rememberers where I was and automatically brings it up.). I LOVE THE FIRE STICK!!!  It’s like I’ve had another world open up for me. And the problems that you read about in previous reviews have been solved. There is now a button on the Fire Stick to turn your tv on and off and there are now two buttons to control your tv volume right on the Fire Stick. I do believe that Amazon has listened too what their customers have said, respected it and responded. IMHO the Fire Stick is now PERFECT!",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"Amazon has a great device to watch all your show, sports, movies, etc. all on one stick with numerous stations which are mostly free if you have a cable subscription. Make sure you have a smart TV and you purchase this Firestick (2nd Generation w/Alexa voice recognition). You can control all your devices (TV, receiver, cable box, DVR, On/Off switches, etc.) all from this stick. I highly recommended buying this item if you enjoy watching TV with the use of one device. It’s all in high resolution even up to 4K. Once you buy it, you’ll love it.....enjoy",5,1,2019-8-11,1,1,0

"I liked the ease of integrating this unit with my TV.  It works very well.  There are many apps to choose from but it does not have the Xfinity app.  I understand ROKU does have this app.  I am unsure as to why it is not included here, it should be so streaming is possible.  There is another problem that has developed.  I have two Samsung TVs; one older, one brand new, both flat screen smart TVs.  The 4K Fire Stick works very nice with the older Samsung but I lose the audio for a couple of seconds now and then when watching on the new TV.  This even happens ONLY with the Fire Stick.  Note also that I have two 4K Fire Sticks and both do the same thing in the new Samsung.  While one would like to blame the TV for this mishap, I believe it is a problem with how the Fire Stick integrates with the new TV--a glitch that should be looked into.",4,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

My 4k phone is my hot spot and I have to reconnect the stick to my TV every time I turn my TV on or the firestick wont connect, errr... I read that Amazon overlooked the phone hotspot thing and I should update the stick, if I can update this to let you know how that went I will. I also wish there was a way to set how long I want my show to stay paused before I have to go restart it.

"We waited a couple of weeks when this new one came out , then bought it because the price dropped. Received the FireStick followed the directions installing it. While using it everything worked fine except when we turned it off the fire stick wouldn't turn back on, we had to unplug the unit and plug it back in. We went online to Amazon help chat and they helped us trouble shoot to a point that they replaced the unit no questions asked. Within a day we had a new unit. They sent  us the return slip so all we had to do was to return it in the box to a UPS store. The unit was replaced and works perfectly. Has many features and is faster. You use one remote to control everything. I would recommend this and also recommend buying it from Amazon. Great customer service and instant returns.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0

"The firestick is a much better streaming tool than roku. Without much research i purchased a roku first and use it in my master bedroom. I acquired a firestick next for my living room and the firestick is much more user friendly. The roku has 2 cords attached, one for power via usb and the other an hdmi. The firestick plugs directly into hdmi and has 1 cord for usb power. For the roku i had to use the sticker on the top of the device to stick to the side of the tv because the remote needs to point directly at the device to work. Firestick is hidden behind tv and works very well. Also firestick connects directly to my tv and soundbar so the power button on the remote turns off the tv, firestick and sound bar. Roku i still have to use a separate remote for volume and to turn off the tv. Theres even more features with fitestick including voice control. I wish i had a firestick in my bedroom now rather than roku but too late to return",5,1,2019-4-17,1,1,0
"As tv provider companies are being bought out by the same companies that already monopolize the cell phone, home phone, internet and everything else, it seems that the tv packages are becoming more limited. Pay more but get less. I've heard so many people talking about taking control of their tb and being so much happier. No more tv packages with 50 channels or more I can't or don't watch but have to pay for meanwhile what I would like is not available, extra cost or in a higher package.

"I love my Firestick 4k. Last year I bought the regular FS (not sure of generation) and enjoyed it, but I wanted one that could perform better and faster. I honestly don't see a huge difference between the 2 except that the picture looks a bit better. I wish there was more than 8gb memory, but I enjoy having the volume button on the remote. Now, the only time I need the tv remote is to turn the tv on/off and to set sleep timers. The voice control performs just as well as my last FS. This FS might be slightly faster, but not so much that I notice much difference. All in all, I'm glad I purchased it. I enjoy using and having Firesticks.**I gave 4 stars because of the small amount of memory. This is a newer FS and one would hope there would be more memory.

"Streaming is great and I can watch Apple TV. However, the interface is messy and not intuitive. It's often hard to tell exactly what item, button, or tab is selected. See something you liked but don't remember the title? Good luck finding it again. Disorganization reigns. A lot of this is inherited from Amazon Prime's abysmal GUI, but with the Fire TV stick I was hoping for something more cross-platform like Roku (which I'll probably end up getting). However, my #1 complaint is that it constantly has network issues (even though no other devices on my network do). I keep having to unplug it to restart it. Plus, it constantly loses its connection to my Plex server, claiming the server is down (again, even though no other devices have any problems). Too buggy. Too messy.

Fortunately, I have still kept Roku connected and it is working beautifully.Sad!  I wanted to disconnect my Roku but it will stay in place.

"The ability to store apps on a connected thumb drive makes this device a real winner over ROKU!  But you have to get the Fire TV Stick 4K and then look at any guide for adding the memory using an OTG cable and a USB 3.0 thumb drive.  OTG cables with extra connections allow you to add other accessories. You should download ADB Remote Keyboard to your phone or use a ADB remote service from your PC to complete the moves. It will make things much easier.  Last tip is to use the grep command to find the packages (apps) you want to move over to your thumb drive.  It will make things much easier to find the right packages to move; i.e., pm list packages |grep oannhd.In my prior review, my apps were lost on my thumb drive somehow and I was finally able to repeat the process to move the apps over again, but had to start from scratch.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0

"I could not be more unhappy with the Fire Stick and customer service.  To keep it short and not replay my customer service calls,  after a few months our Fire Stick kept losing the internet connection which I discovered is a very common problem after doing some research online.  We are talking numerous times each night.  (We have already had the internet provider out who gave us all new hardware, we have always had a very strong signal everywhere in the house. We have had no issues with any devices other than the TV's that have a Fire Stick connected.)  We bought two other Fire Sticks at a local retailer about the same time and are now having trouble with those as well.  They were great at first and allowed us to cut the cord from cable, but not worth the frustration now.  As of last night, customer service said that the Fire Sticks only have a 3 month warranty but maybe they can look into some promotional pricing, although their people are still looking into it (since October 16th).  If this technology does not last more than a few months, there is no way I would invest any more money in it.  A rip off as far as I'm concerned.  Next time maybe Roku or even back to cable, but not Amazon again.  It's a shame they won't stand behind their product, makes me rethink all of the money I spend here.",1,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Updating my 5 star review to 1 star - and I would give it a -10 stars if possible!  Every single one of our fire Tv Sticks have started the annoying ""clear data or cache to make more room"" pop up over and over and over and over while watching anything.  And I mean EVERY Fire TV Stick we have (all 4K) even the one with 3 - yes read this - 3 apps on it.  That stick we only have 3 apps on has ONLY had those 3 apps EVER installed on it!  We have cleared cache, deleted almost all apps, and only reinstall them when we want to watch something on that specific app then delete it again, cleared data, factory reset (what a MAJOR pain because you have to reload EVERYTHING and sign in to EVERYTHING again!) and NOTHING works.  Amazon loaded the sticks up with unnecessary apps like Amazon Music, Amazon Photos, Silk Browser, etc etc that you CANNOT delete (whether you use them or not which we don't) and therefore using a majority of the storage capacity on the stick.  When searching for a fix the problem is all over the internet with people looking for resolution and Amazon doesn't provide one.  HMMMMMMM... My guess is Amazon is about to come out with a new Fire TV Stick and are annoying the mess out of their existing customers in hopes they will buy the new one.  NOPE - NOT HAPPENING!!!  Already upgraded once just a few months ago.  Never again!  So with that, we bid Amazon Fire TV Stick adieu, jump in a lake Fire TV Stick, so long, and we are no longer your sucker!!!!

"Very impressed! My FireTv box refused to connect to my WiFi after being refreshed back to factory as it's controller stopped working a long time ago. Rather than spend $30 on a new controller, I spent $25 on the upgraded stick. Which it turns out, is leaps and bounds better than the previous Stick. On par with the FireTV which was showing its age with storage messages despite having not much more than factory installed apps loaded on it.It's quick, it's responsive and it allows me the ability to control the tv volume. The Samsung TV I use it on has only been used for streaming so no need for 2 or 3 remotes until the included remote kicks the bucket.

First let me preface by saying my goal was to get live streaming TV including local football games without having to pay for a cable provider.  I have an older Visio television that has a few apps on it  and it is very slow. Mounting a satellite dish is not an option for me.The 4K fire stick and a 5G connection did the trick. It is lightning fast and the  amount of free content is unbelievable.  Fire Stick is very easy to install and it comes with very clear instructions.  There is some free live streaming but If you want live streaming of local TV channels you'll have to subscribe  to one of the apps that are offered.  I'm very pleased with the quality of the service and the choices of free apps available.  For example there is an EWTN app which provides the live streaming channel.,5,1,2019-9-13,1,1,0

I don’t want to talk to anyone, just let me return the dam  thing. It wont even do an exchange, which I wanted to do. This is the second Fire Stick 4K I’v bought in he last 2 months, the first one is working fine and has never rebooted in the middle of a video but the new one failed after 2 days of use.What aggravates me is this the 4 time I have problems with Amazon shipping or with defective problems.

With HDMI-CEC, it will even turn on my TV and automatically switch inputs to display the app/movie I requested.  The ability to integrate voice commands through Alexa is a treat.My few gripes:  No way to disable HDR content from triggering HDR mode on my TV.  As of this writing, YouTubeTV still doesn't have Alexa voice compatibility, but would like to be able to request a channel by voice.  No major complaints.

I found that it had so many more fearures than I thought. The quality is amazing. Its simple and easy to use. Just plug and play basically. You have to make sure it is connected to the internet but thats it, it really is that simple. Easy for anyone to figure out how to use. They also sell covers for the remote which I also love, it protects it since I have a 4 year old and makes it easy to find. I now use the fire stick more than I use the features on my smart tv. You can also just unplug it from one tv and connect it to another without any problem or having to reset any features, everything just stays put. You can take it anywhere. I haven't yet stayed in a hotel but I would assume that you can just take it with you and connect it there as well, as long as there is an HDMI port you are good, but it does require internet so if for some reason the hotel doesnt offer that you can always use the hotspot from your phone. I highly recommend. I have smart tvs and Ive had Roku but I prefer the fire stick",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I like the simplicity of the set up. It's even better when you order directly from amazon prime. I don't like the fact that it has to be plugged into an electrical outlet. Finding an available outlet within reach of the device can be challenging depending on hoe many other devices you have plugged in already. do yourself a favor and order a cheap 6 ft extension cord to go with it. Other than that connectivity has been pretty good. I've not used the voice commands that much. So that is why there are no stars for that. Still feel like big brother is listening in on me...Lol...I unplug it when it's not in use. I should also mention I'm not using a 4K TV. Picture quality is quite good though. The quality of the video on my TV watching YouTube seems better than what I see on my PC...(8 yes old) less loading time and far less stalling. Might have more to do with my ancient PC being obsolete. It Works great for Disney Plus! The Mandelorean series looked amazing. Smooth video and Audio. As entertainment goes you can't beat it for the price, and you can take it to hotels and use on your laptop when your out and about using wifi even though it can be tricky trying to find an electrical outlet at a coffee shop.

Until we bought this, our only TV option was DirecTV or a similar service. We were paying $90+ a month for basic plus local sports channels. With the Fire Stick, we now can stream Prime options directly on our TV without having to use a laptop, but it also makes our TV a “smart TV,” wired for the internet so that we can subscribe to great TV apps like AppleTV and YouTube TV (what we ultimately went with). We have limitless and affordable options now, and the TV quality (with a good modem/wireless router for our internet service) is second to none. And, we got our Fire Stick half price with sales.

"We upgraded to Amazon HD music today. Many of the tracks are streamed/broadcast in 24bit x 96K. This Firestick 4K has a maximum audio output of 48K x 16 Bit. While good, this is VERY OLD technology 16bit x 44K has been around since 1983 when the first CD appeared. They went for the gusto on the video 4K but dropped the ball on the Audio.My understanding is the only way to reproduce the 24bit  96K is using the Amazon Music Player through a sound system whereby (example) your PC / MAC has an HDMI or TOSLINK or Optical Audio or COAX audio output directly to your receiver.  There are significant sound resolution differences (in most cases, not all) when comparing 24bit x 96 to 16bit x 44.1.

There is a lot of bad advice on the internet about how to fix Disney Plus so it would work on the Firestick, so I tried them first with no success.  I use a pfsense firewall that blocks almost everything and I had to whitelist 52.0.0.0/11 and 34.192.0.0/10 in order to get Disney to connect to their streaming AWS servers.

"We've never had a ""Smart"" TV,  but we do have about a 2 year old Vizio 42"" TV from WalMart. We've always used a BluRay  player with/for streaming Netflix, Prime, Hulu, etc. We were happy with streaming using our bluray player until a fairly new bluray player stopped supporting Hulu and didn't offer Disney+. I started shopping for options and liked the voice recognition & app options with this Firestick. I don't have a 4K TV (yet) but liked the price in case we upgrade our TV in the near future.  I didn't want to do a review until after trying & using the firestick. We've had it a few weeks now. I also asked a few family & friends and researched my options, too in regards to streaming devices. I'm an Apple user, so I wanted the Apple TV, but didn't have room to run another HDMI CABLE from our wall mounted-TV to our entertainment center/table. Plus the price was more than the firestick. I also like that the firestick will allow you to use your TV for power so we don't have to run any more power or HDMI cables through our wall! This was important to us! We tried using a different shorter usb power cable than what came in the box (to make cable management easier) but we HAD to use the power /usb cable that came with the firestick. Not a big deal. Now I know what I was missing! I love the voice recognition options! I love all the downloadable app options. I don't use them all, but like being able to download them if I want to. I will probably never travel with the firestick like it says I can, but I like that I could do that too. I use the stick for Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video & Music and am very pleased with my purchase particularly for the price. I really like that I can listen to Amazon Music while browsing video menus!

They would not stream I troubleshot for three weeks with hulu Cablevision and Amazon trying to find out what was wrong finally I took the one fire stick that was on the upstairs TV and put it on the downstairs one with this wasn’t working and it worked fine so it proves there were two defective fire sticks that was sent to me the third one they sent finally worked. I think Amazon should be more careful with their equipment and it should be checked before it sent out. This was a new fire stick they were not refurbished and yet both of themWe are defective.

"This new generation of Fire TV Stick is a great improvement, particularly the ability to control my four-year-old Samsung TV from such a simple remote. It linked up quickly and automatically. We gave up cable several months ago, but still had to use the little oval Samsung remote to start up the TV and set volume. ( I call Samsung's little remote the  ""exploding black egg"" because it's constantly slipping out of the hand or off the couch onto the ceramic tile of our TV room, sending me to my knees to find the batteries and cover.) The new Fire TV remote, with TV control, is durable, small, better shaped and doesn't explode when it falls to the floor. My only complaint, as with 95 percent of remotes, is the color. Black is the color of true despair. Since most TV room furnishings are dark tones and lighting is necessarily weak, all remotes should be as close to glow-in-the dark white as possible. My solution is to paint the remote with acrylics or silver permanent marker.  I'd have colored more of it than pictured if I hadn't run out of ink.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,1

I didn't think I needed these, I couldn't have been more wrong hahaThe only thing I hadn't realized, is the firestick itself needs to be plugged into a power source. And if you use the USB plug to plug it back into a TV USB port I don't think it gets enough power and the fire-stick resets frequently.",5,1,2019-2-2,1,1,0
"I have a Seiki 32"" 1080p TV which is about 4-5 years old. I've been using a Roku XD box on it for years, and lately it hasn't gotten laggy, and generally, the picture quality hasn't been that great. I thought it was just the TV until I removed the Roku box and installed the Fire TV stick. The difference is amazing. The picture is much crisper, and the response with the remote is very fast. I've also linked my kitchen's Echo Show 8 with the Fire stick, and can use it to control the TV, which is nice when the remote is out of sight. It's not always as responsive, as I'm still learning what phrases to use for various commands. I've asked it to pause, open Amazon, mute, and so on, and it works.

This is an update to my first 1-star review of the amazon fire stick. I’ve had my fire stick for 3 months now and it’s SLOWER than EVER. It takes minutes and sometimes up to an HOUR to load one damn app. It glitches and will freeze mid-show or movie so many times you could paint your nails the entire time you’re waiting for it to load. I called in twice in one day on thanksgiving because my fire stick wouldn’t load anything hardly. The second woman I spoke to claimed it was an HBO issue and not Amazon’s problem. Which it was very much their problem because EVERY app is giving me the same issue of basically not loading or playing anything. She was just trying to get away with it not being her issue to fix. It also makes you re sign into apps more times you can even begin to count. It’s just such a beyond awful product.My first review-  Why is it so f***ing hard to find a live NFL game on firestick? Firestick makes you download every single “app” for anything and everything you can think of. Then you have to sign in or download each item and it’s becoming such a pain in the butt. I’ve had the Firestick for about two weeks and I’m so sick of it by now. Having to search for anything on here is so much more of a pain than just having a simple guide. Way too many apps and log ins and downloads required to watch just simple TV. I have cable through Xfinity and apps like CBS All Access won’t allow your cable to work. You have to pay even more money to them just to watch normal CBS!!! Honestly I thought I’d love Firestick and I’m to a point where I never would recommend it to anyone. It’s better to just deal with a cable company at this point.,1,1,2019-9-22,1,1,0
"For some reason, the Firestick crashes constantly. It gives me an error message that claims it has no network connection, and that I should contact customer support. I have contacted them - they told me to unplug it,then plug it back in. So now, I do this, repeatedly. It literally can't make it through an entire movie without needing having to do this. If you're watching TV episodes, you should expect to have to do the unplug-replug thing at least every other episode. Oh, and even though it says there is no network connection available- there is nothing wrong with my wifi network. Every other device in my house is connected. I'm writing this review on a wifi-connected device. The Firestick currently shows the 'network unavailable' error, but if you are reading this review, that means my network is just fine...",1,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0
Wish I would have purchased one of these a long time ago. There are so many channels to select from and multiple apps.There are however some that require a subscription but there are so many free channels I wouldn't recommend purchasing live TV. There are several channels that are live TV that do not require a subscription. I even get NFL live free. The Fire stick costs less that any cable subscription. I highly recommend the Fire stick. Only con I have found is it doesn't connect to local TV,5,1,2019-11-2,1,1,0
"We don't have cable, and we don't spend much time in front of the television, but were unable to view a photo-sharing site via Roku.  After researching the problem and learning the photo sharing site isn't updating the 2015 app and that the app works fine on the Fire Stick, we decided to give it a try.  There are bugs in the photo-sharing app via Fire Stick, but the photos are viewable.  When we encounter a bug, we simply uninstall the app, then reinstall it as an effective reboot.  We also were able to purchase a subscription to the Smithsonian Channel, which might actually result in us watching just a tiny bit more television.  Watched the Event Horizon rebroadcast of the announcement of the first photo of a black hole, and oh, did that make our Fire Stick worth the price!!!",5,1,2019-5-16,1,0,0

Fortunately I still have a working Samsung control to handle those tasks.  My other TV is a Coby for which the original control is long gone.  I had an older Firestick that worked for everything, but it later died, so i bought the 4meg to replace it.

"I was weary of the fact that my original very-first-generation Fire stick was performing, but the remote had been dunked in milk (someone-who-shall-stay-in-my-life-but-will-remain-nameless missed the remote control keeper box and the remote took a bath).  Despite alcohol baths, drying, etc.- the remote was never the same.  The phone app works, but it was just tedious to establish/reestablish connections, etc.Long story short- an upgrade was needed.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"When I ordered this, I wasn't sure which of the three options for the Fire Stick I should order.  I'm 70 and not tech savvy. I decided that the Fire Stick alone might not be enough, so I ordered the Fire Stick that comes with an extension - not the option with 3 pieces. As it turns out, I guessed right and my husband and I were able to see exactly what to do once we took the tv down off the wall. We did need to have the flexible extension because our Sony smart tv (about 6-7 years old) has a part of the plastic housing that sticks out and we couldn't plug the device in directly. Once we plugged in the device, we followed the included directions to set the system up and it worked. Our tv has very nice graphics and the Fire Stick does not degrade the videos at all. Sometimes the voice recognition doesn't work the first time, but we just try again. I was hoping that it would pick up our Hulu, but it doesn't. We don't use Alexa, so I really can't comment on that.",4,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I have owned several smart TVs in my life from Samsung and LG. They work well at first, then slowly you lose support for apps as you get used to using them. Not to mention, for whatever reason I couldn't get the NBC Sports app on my Samsung Smart TV, so I got the Fire TV stick and problem solved. Honestly I don't know what the integrated smart TV concept can make it. Each TV maker has a generally difficult to use, proprietary operating system with poor support and rarely any new useful features. All this for an extra $100 or more in costs to the television versus a traditional (non-smart) TV. Amazon comes along with an inexpensive device that does the same thing (and in many cases, more things) with a much more intuitive user interface, and simple integration with your Amazon account for paid content. Throw in the FireTV mobile app (free) and you can now use your smart phone to type passwords and things, or simply operate the entire device if you lose the remote.",5,1,2018-12-2,1,1,0

"The reason I bought the Fire tv stick 4K was that my Philips Ambilight 8 series smart tv is a great product in terms of picture quality and ambilight experience but it is kind of dumb and not that fast when using embedded apps like YouTube and Netflix, so I wanted to give it a boost. Using the Fire Tv stick 4K does just that and it is such a big improvement over the ‘smart’ tv experience. The stick runs very fast and smooth, the voice remote works like a charm and it replaces even the actual tv remote. No need to plug it to a power outlet, I just plugged it in one of the tv’s USB ports and draws power directly from the tv. One less cable to stick out. Great content from Amazon prime video. One small issue, I am not located now in the US so when trying at first to watch something on Amazon prime video I was constantly receiving an error related to geographical location even though my account is US based. I contacted Amazon Prime Video support via chat option and it was solved out in a few minutes, no more errors.I bought it on Amazon Prime Day for $24 if I remember correct, was given a coupon of $15 for using the Amazon Prime Now option, so in the end I paid less than $10 for this great device and got it delivered in under 2 hours. Thank you Amazon!!!",5,1,2019-8-16,1,1,1
"Documentation is sparse but that is OK, this is the sort of thing you learn by using. I was impressed with the very easy setup.I'm still learning, so I have not added any new services yet, just experimenting with the video services I already have - Netflix and Amazon Prime. Amazon provided an app and free service for Tubi TV, and I have not spent much time looking at that yet but a quick skim shows a lot of obscure B movies from the mid-20th century that might or might not be interesting to look into some time. If things continue to go well I'll start running a live streaming TV trial soon.",4,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0

I did upgrade from my Fire Stick to the Fire Stick 4k. I also got the optional ethernet device. I've got gigabit fiber optics to the house and gigabit ethernet throughout.The Fire Stick 4k is plugged in to my LG OLED 55in C9 TV. The Fire Stick install was trivially easy.

It's a Fire Stick so you already know it's awesome.  The 4k quality is definitely an upgrade.  Even standard HD media looks sharper on this compared to our regular Fire Stick.Navigating is a lot faster with the upgraded processor.

"Say you want to have Alexa turn on surround sound, specific room lighting and the TV and everything in the Alexa app looks good. Speakers? On. Lights? On. TV? Nothing. Tell alexa to turn it on separately and it works. But it ALWAYS changes the input to the firestick. Google Chromecast allows you to turn the tv on and off with ease without any issues with google home and doesn't change the input automatically. There are some great things about Alexa but the firestick is NOT one of them. You can stream from youtube to the firestick and I think a few other select apps but for the most part it is a massive failure as you won't even see the firestick pop up if you want to stream directly from your phone. The lack of support considering the price of the device is just sad.",1,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I’m super annoyed with it so far. I got it cause my old fire sticks (first gen) remote was not responding well, it would scroll to the left and then suddenly scroll 100channels at once. Since I put this one two days ago, my TV has gone crazy, it keeps turning on and off, it suddenly shuts off, it freezes shows. It has fallen out of the network more times in two days than my old one did in the whole 4 years I had it. Hopefully it solves itself cause I threw out the box and can’t exchange. 😖 I don’t really care about the whole 4K or the voice, I just want it to work.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0

I'm sure as I get used to it, it will improve. I took off one star for that but otherwise it's great.

"Wow! All I can say is that I’m wowed by this little gadget. It plugged right in to my 5 year old “smart tv” when my original fire stick stopped working. (Original Wouldn’t stay plugged in to the port). It took off running and the picture quality is almost unbelievable. The only thing I would change is to make a longer cord from the plug in to the added weight for the power adapter so it won’t suffer the same demise as my first one. Glad it did, though, as this fire stick and associated capabilities are far superior to the early model. I don’t subscribe to cable, I cut my cord when I got my first fire stick many years ago and bought an antenna for my window. One month of cut cable paid for both the Fire Stick AND the antennae. I have a 44.00 dollar a month internet fee, my Amazon Prime Fee, and my HBO APP for Amazon fire stick. (Dumped Netflix for HBO). Pretty cheap livin and lovin’ it!

"I really want to like these. I have 2 Fire TV Sticks 4k that we’re given to me because my grandmother bought them and didn’t want them. They were unused not even opened. I was so excited and really liked them at first. Even bought a brand new 43” Tv for my bedroom because I don’t have cable in my room so I never needed a tv before. But a month later and both Fire Stick seem to have the same problem.Both constantly have issue with the internet, but I’ve check the internet and it is fine. Even tried to restart the router and that doesn’t even help. It’s easier to just restart the Fire Stick. Apps crash. Apps freeze. Apps don’t even open. Home screen crashes and keeps reloading. Both Fire Stick do this. I’ve tried clear cache data. Force stopping apps. I’ve restored to factor default. Deleted extra apps. I’ve not used up all the memory on the Fire Stick anyways. I mainly only use 3 apps. PLEX, Pandora, and YouTube and occasionally Prime Video. And the only fix I have is to constantly restart the thing. I shouldn’t have to restart the Fire Stick every 5 minutes and I should be able to watch an entire video without it freezing or listen to more than 3 songs with out pandora just stopping. I’m really disappointed because I really liked them at first and was going to even recommend them over the Roku. But my mother has a Roku in her room and I never hear her complain. I even know people with Fire Sticks and they’ve never complained to me so I don’t know how I could end up with two bad eggs.",2,1,2020-1-1,1,0,1
"Bought this at the same time that I got a RECAST box and turned in our Comcast DVR box.  For netflix, prime video, Over-the-air broadcast - works great.  But every now and then, a recorded show comes through pixelated.  Thought I found a solution, but problem comes back sporadically.  Greatest thing about this Fire Stick is the remote control that now has volume control on it, and you can program it to turn on the tv and the sound bar at the same time when you press the power button.  One other anomaly using the power switch - when turning on or off, need to hold for about 1 second to get both devices.  If you quickly press it (like my wife), then just the TV goes off, but soundbar stays on.  When you press it again to turn the TV on, the sound bar will go off.",4,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0
"SO I do not use any of the fancy stuff,,the Alexa voice deal, the 4K deal,,none of the bells and whistles.  Why I bought this is I have a 720 TV with an original Firestick and it was driving me nuts.  I lost the remote (but my TV remote did some of the functions) and it would take 5 minutes to boot up,,when it did boot up.  It was hit or miss,,mostly miss,, to get it to work.  I assume it just aged out but I was waiting for a sale so I did not have to spend 40 bucks on a new one. . So when these went on sale for 25 bucks  I bought one as a replacement and I wish I had bought two.  It is on instantly, it streams anything  perfectly in about 2-4 seconds.  A Godsend for me.  So yay for me.  I use if for Amazon prime and for Netflix.  On occasion I stream a network show I missed.  Perfect for me.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,1,0
"So I ordered the most updated version of the firestick during the holidays. The first one I got kept malfunctioning. The picture would scramble every couple of minutes, and stay scrambled for a moment, then unscramble, and then scramble again, which was very frustrating. After tech support realized it was a problem that could not be fixed, they sent me another firestick. The second one was better however it malfunctions in a different way. This one does not scramble the picture, but anytime I press the voice control button, it changes the source on my TV to another source. Then it stays stuck on that source which is not the source the firestick is connected to. I wonder what the problem is going to be with the third firestick when it comes time that I have the time to sit on the phone with Amazon customer service to have them help me rectify this problem.",1,1,2019-2-12,1,1,0

With one click!I had to call Amazon, where customer service had NO IDEA what was wrong and wanted to walk me through setup again. Using every email address I ever might have used with Prime. Apparently the fact that I had signed into the Fire Stick with the exact same email address and account I ordered the thing with — the one that got me free delivery, because PRIME — meant nothing.",1,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0

"I’m highly disappointed in the FireStick 4K, especially considering the reputation that Amazon has and the online reviews that I saw prior to my purchase. I’ve had non stop issues with many apps, from constant drops in streaming to kicking me out my account. There are a few apps that I have to re-download every time I want to view something, for instance MTV & VH1. There’s not enough storage space so I have to trash apps that I’m not using at the moment to make room for another apps. Not to mention, Amazon has installed several of their own apps that are taking up storage that I don’t even utilize. And one of the most popular apps of all, Disney+ has had “known issues” since it was launched on the FireStick.And to add insult to injury, when I spoke to a rep she had the audacity to blame the developers and told me that I have to reach out to them myself to file a complaint, what kind of B.S. is that?! It’s Amazon’s responsibility to do their due diligence to test all of these apps before you offer them on YOUR PLATFORM!!! If I was still in the return window I’d definitely get my money back and give Roku a try, which quite frankly I’ll probably end up purchasing anyway.",2,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0

"It's amazing what this tiny little stick can do.  I have a Roku and have become frustrated by it's clunkiness and I use it for Amazon Prime and have been blaming Amazon Prime for providing a poor streaming service and this whole time it was the Roku.  I could never rewind with Prime before because it was so slow to respond that I would click the button 3 times before it responded and then it would rewind to the beginning and I couldn't get it to start again.  It was terrible.  Now with the Fire Stick, I use the voice remote to FF or Rewind and it works beautifully.  Sometimes it is hard to know exactly what phrase to use but that is minor complaint.  Another minor complaint is the menu can be weird - it is difficult to tell whether you or on a show or on the application.  It would be helpful to have something highlighted more clearly to know what will happen if you select ""enter""  Again, minor complaint.  For the price it is amazing!",5,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0

It EASILY sets up to work both my TV and my SOUNDBAR. The fact that my TV is one brand and my soundbar is another is no problem.

With one ON/OFF button the TV and Sound System turns ON / OFF with the user's preference.  One trick he learned was, when you are talking to Alexa, you need to press the upper button down so she can hear your voice/commands.  The wring offers Up-DOWN-Right-Left direction to highlight the box related to what you are subscribed to.  The six middle buttons offers Back, Home, Hold, Fast Reverse, Play/Pause and Fast Forward.

"Quite amazing device.  Installed this for a friend.  Nice tactile response on the remote.  Easy setup.  Basically turns any TV into a computer/smart TV as far as streaming video is concerned.  All you need is an HDMI input on the TV and a power outlet nearby.  My friend has a two story house with the router upstairs.  Still received signal downstairs (though I think they have an extender plugged in somewhere on the first floor).  No problems with SD (standard definition), but we had to log into the 5 Gigahertz channel of the router for HD.  (That was easy - just signed out of ""Netgear"" in the network settings and signed into ""Netgear-5G"" instead.)  Again, interface is very easy to use.Only thing I don't like is the microphone built into the remote; I'm a little paranoid about hackers listening in, which the FBI has warned about with regular smart TVs.  Told my friend to at least keep the remote in a drawer or closet when not in use to reduce the risk of someone listening in to their private conversations.  Anyway, the Fire Stick 4K is great.

I buy all of my movies digitally from Amazon and have built up a collection.

"Solution Found in my case: I don't have a 4k TV. I bought this 4k stick at a real good price for the 4k TV I'll buy around the holidays. I have an LG 1080p 60hz TV. Programming was mostly ok but the commercials would cut off and a still freeze frame of another commercial would lock up the TV. I had to channel back and forth to get rid of it. There would be 3 or more instances of this within 20 seconds. Then it occured to me......what if I replaced this 4k stick with a standard 1080p stick, and I did. Everything is now perfect. There is something about this 4k stick that doesn't like 1080p TV's, even though they say it will work on it, or my 4k stick is bad. I'll know better when I get my 4k tv in the future. From now on, I'll use my 1080p stick for my 1080p tv. This is all on my use of DirecTV Now. BTW.....I went through all the reset procedures on the 4k stick that was available and I uninstalled DirecTV Now and reinstalled it all without success.

Constantly having to factory reset the Firestick (this is after the last one I had quit after less than 5 months). Adding Disney+ just makes it worse. If you pause any program on the Disney+ app, the sound comes back and the screen goes black. Additionally, there is t enough free programming to justify using it for Prime Video.

"First and foremost, I am very familiar with the fire srick as I have the 1st gen fire stick and 1st gen fire tv. Just got this fire stick 4k for Christmas, it doesn't stay connected to wifi and apps keeps freezing. Occasionally it just gives a black screen and I would have to unplug the power cord and plug back in to reboot it. At the same time as all these problems, my older units stayed connected to wifi and function flawlessly on other TVs in other rooms.",1,1,2018-12-26,1,2,0
"This is the worst purchase I have made in years! The fire stick is the most difficult to set up and the most user unfriendly device I have used in a long time. It plugs into the HDMI port on the back of my TV, but it then also needs its own power cord. When your TV is mounted on the wall (as many are today) that alone becomes a real pain running another power cord to it. It also comes with ANOTHER remote control (as if I didn’t have enough remote controls now) that is one of those new high tech remotes that has very few buttons but can do a hundred different things. If you’ve ever had one of those remotes, you’ll know exactly what I mean. VERY, very user unfriendly! Then that remote wants you to use it to replace ALL of your other remotes! So, when I turn off the Firestick, my TV AND my sound bar both went off, too! Then, when I turned the TV back on, it came up with the Amazon Firestick screen automatically! Very frustrating! I unplugged it & put it back in the box.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

It’s all but 3 steps, when you select the option to already have it linked up to your Amazon account, when checking out.

One issue, I want attach it to an HDMI cord, so I had to make a quick trip to my local Best Buy to get an HDMI coupler.  I have my U-Verse feed all going through my home entertainment system, then to my TV and PS Gaming system.  Thus the HDMI cord.  I'm in my 70's and fortunately, my daughter and her husband, use Fire Stick.  They were a big advocate for me getting one.  They helped me over the phone (lots of face time due to COVID-19 and social distancing), with getting my first movie on Apple + to watch.  Success was sweet, so I stayed up late to watch another movie on Amazon Prime.  Streaming was great and watching the movies was even greater.  What a thrilling Covid night!",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

"I got this with a coupon when Amazon quit supporting my 75 year old mother's BluRay player. She hasn't been on a computer since 1008 so new tech is not her thing. This hooked right up, as advertised. It does look up by voice, which is correct most times. She does not use this feature though. It streams seamlessly, which is what she needs. The remote is NOT designed for old, arthritic hands but she makes do. It takes her long enough where it sometimes go back to a different screen and makes her start all over. that is the main complaint she has. Overall, it's a nice replacement for her BluRay and let's her use Prime and Netflix, which is all she needs. It even has fewer interruptions than the player she had so I'll say it is worth it for that alone.",4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I have an original Fire TV stick, purchased earlier this year and it works quite well. Although we haven't upgraded to 4K TVs yet, the 4K unit is faster than the original and has more storage, if I'm not mistaken. Plus volume controls built in. My only issue, and it has nothing to do with Amazon or the FS, is my AT&T wireless router, upstairs in my office and usually behind a closed door, does not support bridging to my D-Link access point in the stairwell. Having said that, the 4K stick still works smoothly and brilliantly through those barriers. I'm ready for another one because of the features and, at some point, we'll replace at least two of our flat-screens with 4K.

I really like the fact that this new stick dose 4k and HDR. And all the Dobly Versions . But it’s a little buggy at times.  Every once in a while it doesn’t have any sound so I just restart the stick and everything is good again once in a while  it also freezes . It is not that often so it is not enough to bother me a great deal it’s more of an annoyance than anything. I just wish Amazon would have improved upon the  Second generation Amazon fire tv BOX. This thing was a power house. Amazon had a chance to hit one out of the ballpark if they would have done that.  They could’ve competed against the likes of the Nvidia shield and Apple TV 4K for the most powerful streaming box. It’s too bad that Amazon TV box only did 4K at 30 frames per second  With no HDR. Amazon you should’ve made this 4K stick along with the Amazon fire TV box 2nd generation it would’ve been the best one to combination you would’ve ever had in a long long time.,4,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0

I reached out, this time through chat and the moronic agent told me to reset to factory settings, but neglected to ask if I still had the controller.

The voice recognition is not great. However, they do warn you that it needs to learn your voice and about you. I don’t let it listen in, or store ANY information on any past commands and so forth.

"Overall, the Fire TV Stick is a great product, bringing streaming and casting ability to your older TVs.  Setup is easy as is downloading apps.  My gripe is the stick itself is too large (wide) at the HDMI connection.  The thing would not fit in my Samsung TV with another HDMI port next to it.  My Samsung 32-inch TV has only two ports, right next to each other.  The spacing is such that I can only fit the Fire TV Stick if I buy an adapter, since the end of the stick partially blocks the adjacent HDMI port.  Hey Amazon, simply narrow the stick at the HDMI end so it will work with all TVs without having to buy adapters.  I would also move the mini USB power port on the stick to the end because the side mounting can also interfere with adjacent cables.  I've had to rearrange HDMI cable locations so that the mini USB port can be accessible.",4,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0

I havent really been delighted with the performance of this device. If Im using an app it will often just bump me back to the Home screen without fanfare. Boo, not happy. I get a lot of buffering. Boo really not happy. Apps that are considered free on Amazon were downloaded but then 'not found'. Tried downloading again, still 'not found'. Not just one app but all of them.

My Sony player has 2 HDMI in ports so I tried one of these first to see if the stick would work ok. It did and I'm really happy about that.

You can start programs and fast forward/rewind instantaneously. It's just amazing. I have the latest Roku stick as well but it doesn't compete at all with the Fire's speed.I think there are still some apps not available for the Fire Stick such as YouTube TV so that might be a deal breaker for some, but Amazon seems to be working to rectify that.

"In my living room I use an Epson video projector to view television through my cable box and Blu-rays through my OPPO 203 Blu-ray player. I hooked up the Amazon 4K fire stick to the HDMI input at the rear of the OPPO Blu-ray player. I used the HDMI extender which came with the 4K fire stick as it fit well in the back, as I had an optical connector out adjacent to the HDMI INPUT and it would've been too snug to insert the fire stick unit itself otherwise. I powered the fire stick with the AC adapter which was included in the package as well. Set up was really easy and smooth based on the on-screen instructions. With the projector and the Blu-ray player on and with the 4K fire stick connected to the HDMI input in the Blu-ray player I selected the input source from the OPPO remote to be the HDMI IN.  I don't have a 4K projector right now but the resulting 1080p projected images were excellent. With this set up the only thing that I couldn't do with the remote was adjust the volume using the volume control on the fire stick remote. That's really not a big problem since I do that with a separate remote control to my Sonos play bar surround sound system.

I already had a wifi extender and all the other necessities to make it run more smoothly. So, without those enhancements, I'm not certain how fluidly it would stream. However, for my purpose of watching Disney + on my secondary TV, it works adequately. It is worth the price I paid on sale. However, I likely would have gone another route had I needed to pay full price. I was disappointed at the small number of apps it comes with, most of which are not relevant to me or for channels I already have with my cable service or that come loaded on my smart TV. I would say, do your research and make sure you understand the features and limitations of all streaming devices out there. Evaluate cost vs needed features to avoid disappointing results.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Storage. I have to regularly go and clear the cache or remove apps (btw, I cannot delete any amazon-related apps.) We will be in the middle of watching a movie and will get interrupted with a screen telling us that we are low on storage. It happens all the time and it is getting increasingly annoying. I have deleted almost all of the apps I could possibly remove except for Hulu, Netflix & Disney+. If I have to delete those, this little device will be obsolete to my needs and I will be throwing it in the dumpster and lighting it on fire. This issue needs fixed with the 4K Firesticks. They’re junk. We have older versions that have never given us problems we may be swapping out to use instead. But an older version and use the money you’re saving to buy yourself a Happy Meal.

"I must say I am disappointed in this.  Amazon quit supporting the app on our DVD player so had to get something else to access Amazon Prime.  They offered a discount on the firestick so gave it a try.  Set up was super easy and with the extender, the device is tucked away out of sight.  I took some time to go through all of the settings and set everything up properly for quality etc but the quality is less than desired.  Everything through the stick seems dark and grainy compared to other inputs.  I made sure it had a good connection etc. but it seems noticable to me.  My wife finds it OK and doesnt notice it as much.  I think it likely has something to do with excessive bandwidth compression from amazon.  Ill give it a try but may end up with something else for our streaming needs",3,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"I am new to these devices.  My son set it up.  I do recommend this Firestick technology.  It worked much better than expected.  My son and I are still reading articles to find how to streamline it.  Worth the small price.  Improved my TV viewing experience.  My internet connection is slow.  So voice recognition worked well but sometimes does not recognize my voice.  We are both learning.  Stream quality kept up to my internet speed.  Was not integrated with any other Alexa device because I did not any  It required me to use my Direct TV remote, my TV remote and the Fire Stick TV remote to function properly.

"I already had an earlier Firestick and was pleased with how well it worked.  After readIng some reviews of the new 4k version so I bought it when it was on sale.  As reviews mentioned, the 4k one (even without having a 4k TV) is noticeably quicker to respond and having the volume control on the Firestick remote is a huge advantage - no need to juggle remotes!  Set up was super easy.  I was so pleased, I ordered another for a TV in another room.  If someone is a Prime member, this inexpensive, easy to set up device is a must have!

"Installation was a snap on 2 of these with instant tv power and volume controls ready to go. Video quality and speed is on a par with roku premiere with the amazon prime video app performing better on their own hardware of course. Conversely, the Netflix app loads quicker on the Roku. I had to make substantial lip-sync adjustments for both TVs the Sticks were using; no big deal unless you don't have that feature available. One nice feature was the Color Bit Depth adjustment found in settings. For my high end plasma I could set the bit depth to 12 (the sticks max) instead of the default 8 which reduces banding effects sometimes seen in backgrounds. Didn't like that Prime places an add in front of all their streams; something I didn't have when using a smart screen or Roku. This was despite the fact I turned off all notifications in the settings. I purchased these in order to use the new Recast DVR which I can't rave about.

You have no idea how much this remote is already saving my life, and that is just in the last 15 minutes of me getting everything up and running. I was so tired of having to reach for one remote to turn on and off the tv and another one to turn up and down the volume on my receiver and then the old fire tv stick remote just to find what I wanted to watch, now it's all in one, and I haven't even had time yet to find out all I can do with it.

Not sure if it’s the product I received or just an issue with fire tv in general, but even though the quality is 4K, it doesn’t seem to be as good quality as my Apple TV. Dark scenes appear “chalky” and unpleasant. I adjusted my tv settings to make it less annoying and I’ve just dealt with it since.

All the free stuff you have to literally go through hours of scrolling to find what’s free. Pluto tv is free but it only shows old movies and shows that are old as well. Definitely not what I thought I would be getting. You basically have to still have cable, but they advertise you to get rid of your cable tv and that’s what I did, now I’m sending this back and getting my cable back. Why would I buy this stick just for it to still show Amazon and cable channels, like I already have that, so paying for this is for what reason? You don’t get local channels at all! They are very misleading in advertising this device. I see why hundreds of thousands of people return them with the 30 days! This is going back! Buyer beware!!",2,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I have 4 Fire Sticks, 1 first generation, and 3 of the 2nd generation.  I got a new set up with a 50” Samsung 4K 7100 series TV and Yamaha YAS-108 soundbar; a 2nd gen Fire Stick in the back.  All hooked up thru HDMI and an Ethernet adapter for the Fire Stick.  I didn’t really need a new Fire Stick but I have always liked my Apple TV better being that it’s faster and has a remote with volume control.  So I thought I’d just give it a shot and glad I did.  This new Fire Stick took 3 generations to catch up but it’s there now.  The first thing I noticed is that it’s much faster and now I can just use the Fire Stick remote, with a power button, and volume control that includes a mute button.  The remote turns on and turns off my TV, and controls the volume on my soundbar.  All I did was unhook the other Fire Stick and swapped it out; uses the same power and Ethernet adapter.  Note that this one is longer but it still fit in the back of the TV without the HDMI extender they provide; which is actually thinner than the previous one.  If you don’t want that lag time in between menus, want volume control, and a power button, then get it; and it should be able to handle faster streaming and WiFi with the improvements. Recommend you buy an Ethernet adapter if you’re able to connect thru Ethernet but the WiFi works great too if you have good service and router.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0

I stumbled upon the 4K looking for a new remote for my old fire stick. Amazon had a special offer for me so I only paid $24.99 which really enticed me because it was virtually the same price as a normal fire stick. I had just upgrade our Wifi system with a mesh system and all the review I had read about the 4K said that it would drastically improve my streaming experience.

"I have two 1090p TVs, - living room and bedroom. Last year I purchased a regular (non-4K) fire stick, which worked fine in my main/living room system. When the 4K version went on sale recently, I bought one, thinking to move the original fire stick to my bedroom system and the new 4K fire stick with my living room system even though it's 1080p. The 4K fire stick is supposedly much faster, though connection speed and responsiveness was never a problem with the non-4K fire stick. Unfortunately, the 4K fire stick lost wi-fi connection frequently even though the wi-fi signal strength was very strong. (I have a very fast 5G router.) This problem never happened with the old fire stick. I put my old, non-4K fire stick back in my living room system and no more connection drops. Conclusion? I'm not sure, but perhaps the 4K fire stick is hyper sensitive to wi-fi speed fluctuations. In any case, it didn't work for me, and so I returned it for a refund.",1,1,2019-7-26,1,1,0

Fortunately, Amazon came through and covered it for me.As to use. I find the voice recognition to be poor. About half the time it won't select what i am asking for.

Has HDR, and although not everything that says it's 4K looks that good, I'm convinced it was just the video itself and not the fire stick, because some of the video is crystal clear.

Pretty strange how after owning this TV for over 5 years that within a week of ordering my first Fire Stick, they don’t want to support the *pre-loaded* Amazon App. They did however provide a discount code for $25.00 towards the purchase of another fire stick which I did use.

You can define which inputs get picked when hitting the power and home button. You can define which device the volume buttons control.

I figured this one HAS to work.  Wrong.  It has the same problems in that maybe it will turn on, or (most of the time), I will have to pull the power & then it will work properly.  No rhyme or reason as to when or why it may or may not decide to work.  It may come on with a scrambled, static filled screen, a totally blank screen or a ""Home not Available"" message, or, the most popular...No Signal.  I have 3 ROKU units & they all work  fine.  I have moved the FIRE TV Stick to various TVs in the house & it does the same on all of them.

Another thing is the power cord is kinda short so your outlet needs to be close to the HDMI port. Luckily I have a HDMI hub near the outlet so I plug the FireTV to the hub if not this would be completely useless to me.In terms of apps, I have all the same apps I need on my Apple TV. And the same apps on the Apple TV works way better than FireTV, if I pause a show I was watching and come back to it later, I have to exit out of the show and start from the beginning of the episode.

Those two things as well as a cleaner interface is what Roku 4K does better, I have this 4K Fire Stick and the 4K Roku as I was testing Amazon's item.Love the remote though, much higher quality and sleeker than Roku and the interface seems newer on the Fire although cleaner/cluttered like I said.",4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I love my Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa built in! I've had this Fire Stick for almost a month now and I haven't been disappointed yet. This Fire TV Stick works GREAT, I love how handy the voice control is and Alexa is great at finding whatever I want with very high voice recognition accuracy; I can even ask it for the weather forecast.I've had a Fire TV Stick without the voice for many years and thought it was a piece of junk, the remote was flimsy and the receiver rarely worked. When my old Fire Stick finally stopped working, I'm glad that I decided to give the Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa a chance to prove itself, it is a HUGE improvement over the old model that I've been cursing for years.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Not near enough memory.  Supposed to have 8 G  but actually only has 5.2 G with about 4.5 G already full with undeletable Amazon junk when you get it.So not enough room to download apps.

"When Amazon notified us that as of September 26 their Prime service would no longer work with our television we had to buy a Fire device to continue to watch Amazon Prime programs which we had come to enjoy over network and the current ""unreality"" TV programs.  It was fairly easy to set up even for a 69 year semi-computer literate person and it works well unless you expect Alexia to understand southern accents.  If you don't speak with an accent it is like eating food with no seasoning.  Alexia must like bland food.",5,1,2019-9-5,1,1,0
"Overall, the 4k Firestick is pretty good.  Streaming is fine, apps are fine, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon's Prime stuff all work ok.  The ONE big complaint is that about 20% of the time, the sound will completely drop out within the first 2 minutes of use - sometimes we can power off from the remote, let it sit a minute, then power back on, and the sound comes back; other times we have to pull the USB power out and do a hard reset.  Maybe its an issue between the Firestick and my Samsung TV.  I don't know what causes it, but it sure is annoying.  But other than that one issue, the device seems to be OK - no random lockups or reboots.  We don't use the Alexa stuff, as I don't want Amazon listening to what's going on in my house.",3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"We had been perfectly happy with no cable for 10 plus years and just streaming things on our Sony blu ray dvd player where we could stream Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix.  Then one day we received a message from Amazon telling us it would no longer support blu ray dvd players for Amazon Prime videos and that we would need to purchase a firestick if we wanted to watch Amazon Prime on our tv.  I hate the awkward remote and the fact that fact that it is so difficult to just browse Amazon Prime movies, it is like they are constantly trying to sell me other streaming services by automatically showing previews for movies offered by other services.  Absolutely hate this, it feels like my privacy and simple lifestyle has been invaded.",1,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"the only thing I really like about this is the price. but if it doesn't offer what you want, price is irrelevant. let's walk through the shortcomings of this Fire 4K stick and, pretty much, all Fire devices:1. DO NOT PURCHASE ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS USING AMAZON PAY - AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE YOUR BACK SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ANY BILLING ISSUES WITH A SERVICE PROVIDER. My point: on 10/19 I cancelled a subscription to sling tv that I set up using Amazon Pay. On 10/26 I was billed again for sling tv; ONE WEEK AFTER CANCELLING IT. I contact Amazon customer service (a nightmare in itself unless you have 3 hours to kill speaking to someone who has no clue what you're saying because they're in Pakistan!) and finally went to the top. I sent an email to Jeff Bezos and received a response from Jason Kayne of Amazon.com’ s Executive Customer Relations. His response:",1,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

Amazon customer service was very helpful and sent me a new firestick,  which probably was not necessary as i believe it was my user errors causing the issues.  With their help I was able to install the Firestick and it works great.  My service tech called me three times to assist me; even to the point of getting an Apple tech on the line with us to assist in mirroring (air play) from my mac computer to my TV.  I'm very pleased with the firestick and Amazon's customer service.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
I bought 3 of these (one for each TV) and a subscription to HULU as a replacement of our very expensive Dish network service.  I couldn’t be happier!!  These little sticks broadcast and stream amazing video quality and are very user friendly.  My kids love that its 1 button to turn everything on and then they use the voice control to find the shows they like.  This even seamlessly bluetooth connects my TV to the soundbar with 1 click of the button (something 3 techs that came to my house with Dish couldn’t do).  I wish I would have done this years ago.,5,1,2019-11-6,1,1,0
"I upgraded to this latest version because my first gen firestick was taking forever to load. I wasn't disappointed. This one is much faster and loads almost instantly. It also comes with a lot of controls that I have connected to my Yamaha receiver so now I can actually control turning on the TV and the firestick from this controller, which I couldn't do with my other one. It also have a volume selector which is really great. It allows me to use this as a complete controller when dialing up Prime movies!!The only negative I have noticed so far is that when it loads a video, there is some sort of lag in the quality of the movie for the first minute or two. It is kind of blurry for the initial start up and then it works itself out and is fine. It doesn't do it on every load but has on several. Not sure why this is happening yet but it didn't happen on the other one so I'm thinking it is doing something behind the scenes and needs to catch up. I will update this review if I find out why this is happening or how to prevent it. Overall, I am really happy I did the upgrade.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I bought this after Thanksgiving and although it was on Prime, it took weeks to receive.  The unit itself arrived in a box with understandable instructions.  I was able to hook up myself without calling my son for help which is a plus!  The shows present differently on the apps than they do on Roku.  For instance, once I logged into Hulu I then had to find my shows again and add them to the watch list.  One of the shows on my old (Roku version) Hulu account is now showing that I need to purchase an extended package to access.  I'm not sure it that's due to the Fire Stick vs. Roku or they just changed the show across the board.  In any case, I'll get used to the new way of looking things up and I think it'll be a good product.  I left off the one star due to shipping time and then having to re-load my favorites into the apps.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I still love the compact simplicity of the remote, and the voice response is excellent.  Installation and setup of the 4K Fire Stick was, as expected, straight forward and quick.

"This device has the potential to be excellent, but it has two significant flaws:The first and primary flaw these Amazon Fire TV devices have is the mbcache.db ... it grows until it consumes nearly all the usable space and then can't install games.

"I'm a big fan of Amazon products in general, and own about a dozen Alexa products.  The integration of Alexa into this latest version, along with universal power and volume controls for your tv, make this item a no-brainer.  I do own Roku devices as well, but the voice search on Fire TV is a big advantage, and it searches competitor sources, (like Netflix), to find titles.The Roku does have the advantage of a headphone port on the remote control, allowing you to use headphones without a separate bluetooth or plug in option for the tv.  These go on sale regularly, and can't be beaten for the price.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

Granted I have to wait to see certain programs but they eventually pop up on Netflix or Hulu which both combined only cost less than $20 per month and if you open them to use other apps available on the internet you can watch almost any show or movie within 24 hours after they play on cable or satellite Tv.

I bought this as a more cost effective option to replace my older apple tv that I couldn't update to get Disney+ on it.  It is MUCH better than I expected. Setup took less than a minute after I plugged it in...maybe because we already use several echo devices.  The tv I have it hooked up to is not a 4K but it works perfectly. Watched a show on it...great quality and noticed no issues. Will try it soon on another one we have that is 4K but really bought it for this one. Played around a bit.  Music playback and my playlists were great. Nice to just click a button to skip a song. I was able to get my smart bulbs to work without yelling to you-know-who in the kitchen. Is a quieter option when most of the house is asleep already.,5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"ABSOLUTELY!! Because: 1) To begin with, when it is purchased from Amazon, it arrives pre-loaded with your Amazon account information! 2) Just plug it in, and selections EASY to make and set-up from on-screen choices! 3) Five (5) Gigs of storage! 4) Easy-to follow menus to download, install, and control apps! 5) Easy-to-understand interface! 5) The Fire TV Stick 4K Immediately recognized my wireless router via my home's 2400/5GHz, WI-FI, and functions flawlessly. 6) GREAT hand-held remote design and function ... I purchased 2 within a month of each other - probably will be purchasing a 3rd and 4th ""Fire TV Stick 4K""! Finally, there is the ""Amazon Return Policy"" ... If you don't like it?

"So, I have the original Fire Stick still which works fine but if the distance to the device is more than average [over 13 feet] the original tends to not connect - I don't have that issue with this latest Fire Stick.  Also, it's much easier to use as far as navigation with this device and having a dedicated On/Off is a plus as with the original I couldn't ""turn it off"" and it ran thru the batteries super quick...I assume that is why the batteries always needed replacing.  Also, I don't own an Alexa or Google speaker/whatever it's called - but this Fire Stick has an Alexa ""helper"" in it for navigating the show menus - I haven't really used it but it appears to work fine.  I like this device very much, I very much like the Prime Video choices and I'm enjoying using it.

"I've been a fan of Chromecast since it first released. But this product works better in several areas. The connection to my wifi network is more stable. I have yet to drop a stream. Granted, this device is newer and I don't have the newest Chromecast to compare it to, so make of that what you will. Bought this during Prime Day for $25 which is a bargain for a 4k streamer (or any streamer) and significantly cheaper than the $80 Chromecast Ultra.The features I find most useful are the included remote, the fact that it runs a version of Android, and that it has 8gb on-board storage. One problem I've had with Chromecast is that sometimes the connection drops between my phone and the device, usually when watching long videos, especially with Youtube. That's not a problem with the Fire TV stick since the physical remote never loses connection. Running Android and having internal storage allows you to sideload Android apps that don't have official releases on the Amazon App Store. I haven't used the voice feature on the remote a lot but the few times I have used it, it has worked flawlessly. You can also connect other bluetooth devices to it, like a game controller. All in all, a very good video streaming device.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
So far I’m not impressed EXCEPT for the fact that it syncs with your tv so no need for two remotes. Some apps I had on my year old version of the Roku this device doesn’t have which is a bummer. It just stopped working last night in the middle of use and I eventually took the batteries out and put them back in and it worked again. It doesn’t have an option to search for apps unless I just haven’t found it yet but I’ve extensively looked. Maybe I’ll get the hang of it soon and update this. If you’re looking for a nice 4K option then this is nice for Netflix and Amazon Prime movies. The Alexa feature is sometimes nice when she works.,3,1,2018-11-13,1,2,0

AppleRemote is terrible, IMHO. I also appreciate the Amazon customer service in assisting us to integrate our Alexa with FireTV. We were careful to install the correct FireTV app on our phones which works ok if I can’t get to the physical remote. We had some issues with FireTV needing to be reregistered every time SCE shut down our power (yes, we get PSPS!).

"I bought three of these new Firesticks and also have the 2nd Gen 4K Fire TV box. The new remote with volume and power buttons makes this the best Firestick yet. I recently cut the cable TV cord and went with online streaming only, currently DirecTV Now for regular TV, but I'm also going to try out Hulu Live TV.  Since I no longer have cable boxes and I'm getting most everything using apps on the Firestick, the volume and power buttons are great and I can pretty much just use the Fire remote for everything. Set up of the remotes on two Vizio TVs couldn't have been easier with no coded to enter. The Firestick must have recognized the TV brand through the HDMI port and all I had to do was verify the volume buttons worked on the remote setup page. A 3rd older TV wasn't recognized but setup wasn't hard, I just had to keep hitting the button on the remote scrolling through coded I guess until I got the right one, similar to other universal remotes. Now I can control the power and volume on those TV's with just the Fire remote.

"I was looking for another Fire TV device and found out the Fire TV pendant 3rd gen designs were no longer being sold. It was a choice between the Cube and the Fire TV 4K stick for a 4K device. As I don't want an always on cube microphone listening to me 24/7 and the Fire TV stick has some good specs and all the 4K options you could want, it was a better cheaper deal over the cube. Glad it comes with a short HDMI extended since it was so long to fit directly into the TV's HDMI slot due to the shape of the TV back.I use it with an Ethernet adapter, it found and used it with no problems. Menu response is quick and latest Fire TV interface is an improvement. The ability to turn on/off and control the volume of an attached TV is really nice when it's a simple setup. One remote can now control a basic TV with Fire TV setup. It found the TV type through the HDMI connection and the TV functions worked with no problems on the Fire TV remote.

I am even installed it by myself, and I am 74 years old and have no technical skills. You will have a hard time trying to get the back off to install the batteries.  You have to use both hands, clasp entire front  and back with your entire 2  hands like you would clap, and hold the remote like your hands are 2 slices of bread with the remote as the meat inside.

Keep in mind that I have 4 firesticks in the house and they all have the same issues. Months ago, things seemed to work just fine, so I believe it is definitely software related. My Roku devices work fine at all times. Great devices but those behind the software development need to do more testing before they release it to the firesticks.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

It took a min and a second googler for us to figure it out. We thought the TV was gone and done. It was shutting itself off and on over and over and over. We called the manufacturer called tv repair shops yeah we thought the tv was done. Turns out when you program the remote from the tv into the firestick remote this can happen! It's not just me. This is something that needs to be fixed. It's a glitch! It was the firestick remote that was going haywire turning the tv on and off in a repeated over and over onset. You could unplug the firestick and the tv and nothing would reset. We had to go and program the firestick to a tv downstairs in the house to get it to stop doing what it was doing.

I received the first one as a Christmas gift from my son and daughter-in-law a couple of years ago.  It's great that it's portable from one smart TV to the next, but since I do a lot of crafting and spend equal amounts of time watching programs or viewing things on YouTube upstairs and downstairs, I decided to get a second stick to avoid the daily transport from one TV to the next.

"This is one of the best investments I made! No more expensive cable bills ever! All you need is a fire stick and some good quality wifi. Ever since we bought this fire stick my husband and I have saved over $100 every month. We noticed all we do Nowadays is stream. From using Netflix, Hulu, and amazon prime. So we decided to cancel the cable service and just buy a firestick where you can stream free movies, shows and more. We still pay for Netflix and Starz and prime, but I'd pay $20 a month instead of $180 sometimes $200 in cable services. Once you buy a firestick and connect it to your amazon account, just download an app called Morpheus Tv and Mobdro. Morpheus Tv is where you can stream shows and free movies and mobdro is a form of cable. It Streams Live TV.

This device streams very well most of the time but sometimes does show loading screen delays. So far if it wouldn't have the loading screen issue I would give it 5 stars but since it does have that issue I feel that 3 stars would be the best rating. I am not sure if it was from using for longer than 4 hours straight or something else but this issue was the primary thing I was hoping to avoid. If after a few months and this loading time gets worse I would have to say it needs a hardware revision (based upon my internet is running at least 200 Mbps) to improve loading times to justify a 3-star rating or above. Most of the time no issues are noticed and therefore overall I think I would recommend this to people I know.,3,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"Replacement for a perfectly functioning Roku XR that will no longer work with certain shows provided by Amazon Prime.  That's fine; time marches on.  But I expected this device to be better than the old Roku.  That was just not the case as many features of the Roku were missing and features that were there in the Fire just did not function well. For example, many and frequent disconnects from our LAN; the router is 12' away.  With every disconnect, I had to partially reinitialize the device.  Why is that?  You'd think the Fire would be advanced enough to hold the login data but I guess not.  This unit simply didn't measure up to the old Roku.

The quality of it is inconsistent, buggy, at times the fire stick kicks us out of an app. Customer service is not great, takes forever to get through, we did receive a message in response to our original review and followed  through on their recommendations. Unfortunately this only works for a time and a few days later it starts all over again. We get kicked out of whatever we’re watching and have to reset all over again.",1,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I bought this because I needed another firestick for another TV.  I have the first generation already.  Man is this faster and just seems to work better.  Remote has more range it seems and more options on the remote.  I also have an alexa in any room so this was a no brainer.  I had to take one star away because I have not had one successful attempt with asking alexa to work on the remote and also it seems picky about what bluetooth devices I can attach.  I have a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I could not get either to pair.  Other than that, still worth the $30 but I would be disappointed if I paid more.",4,1,2018-11-29,1,1,0
"My Samsung 7100 UHD smart TV had a terrible remote that made the TV almost unusable, a problem shared by all lower end Samsung TVs.  Rather than return the TV, I turned it into a dumb TV with the Fire Stick supplying all the smart features.  The best aspect is the excellent Fire TV remote, which is similar to the remotes on expensive, high-end Samsung TVs.  Problem solved.  Of note, I do not receive broadcast on this TV and watch only Netflix and Prime.",5,1,2019-7-15,1,1,0
"I had the 2017 Stick and sent it back. It overheated all the time and would reboot randomly. My main use for it was Playstation Vue, and it was pretty much unusable for that, even aside from the reboots. The new 4K stick handles Vue great - even better than my PS4 Pro. Great picture quality, snappy menus, no stuttering or buffering, consistent 60 fps framerate. It also works well for Netflix, HBO Now, Starz, Showtime, and every other app I've used on it. Alexa integration works pretty well. It's neat to be able to give fairly complex voice commands and tell it to do things like ""skip ahead two minutes thirty seconds."" The remote works well and feels good in the hand. The only reason I gave the 4K Stick four stars instead of five is that it pushes Amazon Prime shows too hard and makes it unnecessarily cumbersome to get to the content I actually want; nothing against Prime shows  - there are several I like - but it's a small portion of my use for the device and the portion of the Fire TV interface that Prime TV takes up is way out of proportion to the use of the device.",4,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0
"I was born in a wonderful, simpler time when we were kids who played outside and rode our bicycles for miles and miles. We belonged to Scouts, both boy and girl, and had tree houses that our dads built. We played in the irrigation ditches and no one had a lot of money. The only things that were smart were US; a fact that was reinforced by our scholarship grades and we were rewarded accordingly, whether the grades were good or bad. So, I only say all of this because I have little need for computers and avoid them whenever possible! But, sometimes we have to bend and with ""Game of Thrones,"" season 8 fast approaching and a Dish satellite without HBO, I had to move into the 21st century.I bought my little Fire Stick, watched a UTube and voila, I was watching Jon Snow faster than Arya's sword dance.

"I'd been using the integrated apps on my TiVo Roamio for years to access Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, etc.  But I found the apps through the TiVo to be very slow with cumbersome interfaces and inconsistent and non-intuitive navigation.  So I thought I'd give the Firestick 4K a try. I love it. Compared to the TiVo integrated apps, the interface is fast and responsive. I find the navigation intuitive and a pleasure to use. Setup was simple and took me all of 10 minutes from the time I opened the package to when I was enjoying programs. The built-in Alexa voice on the remote is especially handy for searching for programs and Youtube videos. I have an Echo in the same room and the remote and Echo play nice together. The Echo ring will light but quickly realizes I'm accessing Alexa through the remote and never gets confused - I'm impressed.My only suggestion for improvement: I'd prefer the back of the remote to be flat rather than rounded.  I like to keep the remote on a table near me and will often press a button without having to pick up the remote. That's hard to do because with the rounded back, the remote tends to move and slide. That's a small quibble though.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"Seamlessly integrates many apps without the need to enter into each app every time you want to watch something from them, which is so very great compared to the clunky and slow Roku. Features are nice and pretty smooth too.But I have had to repeatedly restart the firestick seemingly every day or two (degraded/loss of streaming, freezing/slow response, loss of prime live), which I almost never had to reboot roku. Also when I do reboot the firestick, it often requires me to unplug and plug it back in as for some reason, rebooting causes it to lose all power.",4,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
"Works fantastic and this is #2 for me and my old stick worked terrible, this is running fantastic..  and I cleared up so much bandwidth using it's  eitherlink capability so get the cord with it, alot of people don't know but eitherlink is always way over the wifi speed .. you may pay for 100mbps  but you get from your router about 60-75 megabytes per second and eitherlink is always running at at least 85 percent fast mind runs at 130 mbps so this fire stick is flying .. my old 1st Gen was so slow it chopped all up and I usually don't get hd .. this model is extremely fast even on wifi .. this is a 4 core processor with more ram .. and the actual stick is much larger .. fits fine just larger to house all the new improvements ..  seemless operating with the menus and I'm running up at 4k without any problem even though most broadcast in 1080 ..",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"This. Product. Is. Everything! Bought a new home and decided to change from cable to streaming services. Was used to using a voice remote so I really wanted that feature. I planned to stream Hulu Live, Philo, Netflix, Amazon Video, HBO Go and Showtime. I was already in possession of a google chrome cast and was given an xfinity flex from my internet service. The chrome cast was not as efficient and did not have the remote capabilities and the flex did not have all of these apps available. My friends use Apple TV which cost over 8x the firestick so when I found this product that streams ALL the services I want, has the voice remote, AND for the price it was a no brainer!! Bought several for each of my TVs and couldn’t be happier! Comes with batteries so you can be set up in literally minutes and synced to your TV so you only have one remote! Could not have been easier! Soo happy I went with this!",5,1,2019-11-2,1,1,0
"I have edited this review solely based on a call back from Stephania at customer service. She was excellent and explained the issue that I was having., which I had already solved after getting off of the phone with technical support. The answer was so simple that tech support should have been able to easily solve the problem, it was that the firestick only controls itself & I needed to use my Samsung remote to change the source. While I give her a 5-star rating, the tech support was so had that I need to be honest and average out the experience to a 3-star review.  After being on the phone for over an hour with support for the Firestick I was told by edward (edwardo?) that you couldn't use the firestick with Fios as the alexa remote won't change the input source. This would not be a problem if I could still use the fios remote, but it has been disabled by the alexa remote. So now I can only watch Hulu, Prime, and Netflix that I could watch previously as I pay for them. but I can't view all the channels that I pay for with fios. If you want to get really frustrated, try to communicate with their techs - English is not their primary language. All this & Fios claims that it supports Alexa voice remote.",3,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"Great device, and I bought five of them. However, on the living room TV with Home Theater System, after about two months of all day operation, the Firestick began rebooting in the middle of streaming programs. Over two days it became very severe, rebooting after five to fifteen minutes of operation. It would interrupt the streaming and throw it all the way out to the startup screen, as if it had just been powered up. I checked one of the other TV's using a Firestick 4K and it had no problems, so it wasn't internet. I found the 'Restart' feature - Home -> Settings -> My Fire TV -> Restart. After restarting it ran error free for nine hours, and another hour so far this morning. Also, after restart the Home Theater system didn't restart and we had no sound. After fooling with it for five minutes trying to get the Home Theater restarted, it restarted on it's own. Hope this helps someone. Still a great device and would buy again.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"This won't be a very technical review because I'm tremendously behind the times. But if you're someone like me, past 60 and unsure whether this gadget is for you, please get one and have someone else install it if you must. Not just because you'll have a whole new world of movies, TV shows and even the Internet to explore, but also because it makes doing that easier than it probably is for you now. I now use the tiny remote that came with the Fire Stick instead of a $200 remote I'd been using for years that needed to be programmed whenever I updated equipment and almost required a PhD to understand. The little Fire Stick one almost set itself up, and I was able to jettison the other one entirely. As soon as the Fire Stick was connected, everything worked better and more efficiently. So I am thrilled that I finally took the chance to buy and install one--and if I can do it myself, anyone can. If I could give it ten stars...I would!",5,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
"First, All as advertized.  I wanted to try youtubetv.  Firestick was easy to install and I asked Alexa for youtube tv, she found app and displayed the download page.  Next I started a 30 day trial with youtubetv.  I still had Dish so ran on parallel.  After 2 days I ordered 2 more Firesticks for my other 2 TV's.  They also installed easily.  Today I am going to cancel my Dish service (after 15 years of great service) and save $100 per month, with a $150 (three firesticks) investiment.

"Update May 6, 2019 - As we use the Fire Stick 4K with apps other than Amazon Prime Video we are seeing a general issue with the video and audio being very badly out of sync.  That is the sound and picture are not happening at the same time, the lips are moving but the speech has already happened.  This happens on a multitude of apps such as Netflix and Hulu among others.  I have reduced my rating from 5 stars down to 3 stars.  Whatever is causing this synchronization issue needs to be fixed with either a firmware update to the Fire Stick 4K or a change in the tool chain that apps developers are using to develop apps for the Fire Stick 4K.Bought the Fire TV Stick 4K in combination with the Fire TV Recast 75 hour.  We love this Fire TV Stick model.  Fire TV Stick finally comes of age and has decent features and speed - it will run all the apps without faltering at all.  Also like that I can control the TV on/off and the sound bar on/off/volume from this stick.  We have replaced 4 remotes with the remote for this Fire Stick.",3,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0

When they're at your house, it's a complete luck-of-the-draw in hoping you got someone competent to do it (and you usually didn't).Forget all that! This Fire stick is a complete game-changer.

"Since Amazon unveiled their ultraHD music service you would think they would flash the Firestick device to support their own service which right now is one of the worst Ultra HD music offerings available.  It doesn’t offer bit perfect playback, doesn’t integrate with Roon or other applications.  If it’s a hardware limitation maybe it’s time to spend some of the trillions of dollars you have and actually create a Firestick that also incorporates 24 bit, 192khz Ultra HD music capability through the Firestick.....

I happily canceled my cable TV the day this arrived.The remote is nice and minimal, but too small and slippery for my liking, so I recommend buying a silicone cover for it.

Well, I decided to take a chance and I couldn't be happier!! It has everything that the Apple TV does and then some! The only thing I can't do with it is use AirPlay but for me that is fine, everything I need is on YouTube for sewing videos.

"The stick was easy to get started with. It was already linked to my account so I just had to go through the process of providing credentials to the various services I subscribe to (AppleTV+, Netflix, HBO, Showtime, PBS) but Prime was already good to go. Streaming quality has been very good, data buffering is effective to keep the show going, and the user interface is pretty easy to learn. My spouse is a technophobe but she picked it up pretty quickly. My only peeve, a minor one, is you have to use the back arrow multiple times to get back to the home screen from many of the apps.

Stream quality is as good as the streaming itself.  Compared to my old smart Blu-Ray player, it is a miracle, it has no holdups plus it has access to more things.

I noticed after I purchased the 4K that the original Fire TV Stick also has the same remote, so both of them are better than they were before. Great streaming device.

I haven't used the Alexa feature as I have other devices in the room that have Alexa.The biggest annoying feature for me is that w.hen I turn the Fire Stick off and then turn it back on it goes to the default home screen.

"Easy to install and configure.  Tons of available apps/program channels/content.  Beautiful picture and sound on my 4K HDR TV.  I really like the intuitive and snappy user interface (using the supplied remote).  But when I tried to use the Alexa voice feature on the remote - WOW - super loud volume when Alexa provided audio feedback.  Painfully loud at times.  After some experimentation and working with Amazon tech support a few things became clear - different apps/content have varying volume levels.  Some are lower which causes me to turn up the volume on my TV.  But then if I try to use a voice command Alexa's feedback will be really loud.  And the bottom line is that there's no way to independently reduce Alexa's volume in the Fire TV Stick 4K settings.  So I'm stuck with painfully loud Alexa feedback at times (whenever I'm viewing content which has inherently lower volume level).  This would seem to be a major oversight in the Fire TV Stick 4K design - there should be a setting where one can reduce the volume level of the Fire TV Stick's audio prompts & Alexa's voice feedback.  Other than this one design flaw,  I'm really happy with it so far.",4,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0

"I've always owned Roku streaming players.  They great products overall.  In my opinion, Roku has let the competition overtake them.  I recently bought the newest top of the line Gen 7 ""Roku Ultra (4661)"" to replace my Roku Gen 3.  In reality that was needless to do .. the Gen 7 actually runs slower at times, especially on pressing keys and then seeing a reaction happen.  Other than the volume control is included on the remote for the actual IR of the television, I don't see any advantage to the upgrade.  Not so with the firestick.  It runs on the Android operating system so you can install so many applications to give you content and more.  The remote is okay and is absurd Amazon doesn't have a mouse app built into the unit (must purchase the super flaky Mouse Toggle program).  It's not perfect for advanced users like me, but for the average person it is wonderful and easy to use.  The interface is not my favorite, I like the Roku better by a bit ... but the options and ability to have access to the Android family of applications is amazing.  Yes you can also buy an Android TV box with much more power - but it's not needed for most people.  I just wish the units had more memory.

"It 'SAYS' you can cast, like from your phone TO the Fire stick. Ive had 3 different brands of phone since my first fire stick. Mysteriously, Not one of them has been able to connect. You're better off with Chromecast or a room if you want this feature because Amazon is straight up lying that it works on their proprietary fire stick. Can't get Google anything on it so forget playing any Google purchased videos. Won't even work thru the fire stick browser OR a downloaded Firefox browser. AMazon has balls charging $40 for a product that doesnt even work as ADVERTISED. Spent 5min on the phone with a customer service rep and after a couple of questions, her go-to solution is right to factory reset. Seriously? Yeah, no big deal for her to have to re-login to everything! The service on this thing, all around, is shotty. Streaming, video quality, connection. I'm pissed that I spent money to upgrade. To This.It advertises at 8gb. But after their requirements to operate, youre down to 5.64gb of space. But Then you have to update it so you actually go down to just over 4gb of avail space. Remeber the old days of small phones and comouters? Have to delete 5 apps so you have this one other one in the aoo store? Dleting FB so you can use a browser then delete the browser so you out fb back on it? Welcome back to that philosophy. Then, As soon as you drop below 1gb, you'll get constant alerts that you're out of space and need to delete.  Because Amazon eats up so much of the left over space with forced crap apps. I don't use IMDB. Can't remove it. Amazon FreeTime (for kids)? No kids but Can't remove it. And several others, that SHOULD BE A CHOICE!!!!!!!! I had my basic firestick for years and never had to delete anything, at any point. I got this 4K version in Nov 2019, and by April, my live TV option had been removed. and by july, with 3 apps, i was getting errors left & right that i was running out space. Even tho my apps amounted to not even 1gb. Customer service says the only fix is to reset to default. Now, without adding anything new, Other than what I always had on it, I'm suddenly getting errors that I'm out of space and must delete. I barely have half the apps I once did yet I'm constantly being told to remove. Nothing worked and they sent me a new one. Thats when i discovered that they are using up even more of your avail space for all the forced garbage. Those apps should be a choice. With only 8gb to start with? And the operating system already coming out of that, on top of the increased amount used to update it, when setup? The forced apps are just blindly robbing us of More space and they Still think its worth $40 freaking dollars? When your stuck missing out on so many android apps and the ability to actually cast from another device? (Unsure of just many side apps i tried, as well but conveniently and mysteriously, not one of them worked.) Its a rip off. Amazon as a whole is a complete and greedy joke. It's turned into merely an upgraded version of wish.com or picnsave! And I'm now looking for a Roku or Chromecast. JB needs to be kicked in the face with a reality check for thinking this acceptable to be ripping people off like this. For $40, there should be access to way more than 8 GB on this thing! ANd not so much of it used up by Amazon proprietary garbage that will never get used but every customer.",1,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"I have a firestick in my bedroom and an apple tv 3rd generation in the Livingroom so decided to upgrade the apple tv, I bought this on black Friday for 25buks and this thing is awesome! I wish I bought 2 to change the one in the bedroom as well. Love the volume and on and off Butten editions on the new remote, the picture quality is great, and it works far faster than the regular firestick. Setup was easy as well. There is no way anyone is going to be unhappy with this device. Alexa features are awesome, and I can send text messages to any firestick in the house using the app on my phone. Pairing the remote to my TV was easy, it didn’t find it automatically, so I had to select the TV brand and after that all worked fine. All the TV apps are available, and it has great accessibility features for the blind. Get this firestick 4K and you will not regret it for sure.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I received an email from Amazon saying they would no longer be supporting my blueray player in the near future and offered a $25 discount on this Firestick. Plus I had credit on my account, so with free shipping I had an amazing deal. Very intuitive and quick to set up. I haven’t used Alexa so I’m not reviewing that. I do appreciate having just one remote to use now! I only have an internet/phone bundle with Xfinity, so I watch Prime, Netflix and HBONow (which was all I watched before, so I cut cable cost substantially). No issues with buffering, I have a high speed internet. A slight delay turning on my TV that is barely noticeable. Same with the volume control. I’m just sayin’, but it would not be a deal breaker at all. Picture appears sharper, I’m pretty happy with it!",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"These days you can go with a Fire stick by Amazon or the OTHER big company's streaming options. I have used both and they both are great. However, the differentiation for me is the voice-component of the Amazon fire TV stick. I am surprised how well the voice search works and the integration with Alexa is terrific. We have several Alexa enabled devices in our house and I can use the remote to not only control what I watch on TV but also turn on or off other Alexa enabled appliances around the house.Plus, I can have the TV on and use the remote to control music playback or timers while working out in the basement. I have had no issues with playback quality or streaming. This is a worthy device.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
I really want to like the Fire Stick. I can get really good tv without paying an arm and a leg. Voice recognition is pretty good. I don't know about using it with Alexa but will work on that next as I add smart plugs to control the power to them.I'm taking 1 star because it does buffer more than Roku.,3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
I'm not sure what's wrong with it but it doesn't stay connected to the TV all the time. If I switch back to a cable and watch a show when I go back to the stick I will sometimes have to unplug it from the tv to get it to come back on.My old fire stick does not do this I put that back in place of the new stick to see if it's the tv but I never have that problem with the old stick I can go to a cable Chanel watch it then come back and the old fire stick will come to life immediately. So I know it's not the tv connection.,5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"I got my first Fire Stick with Alexa remote a year ago. Although I have an older TV that required an adapter to connect the Fire Stick, it worked great! Until about 2-3 months ago, when all of a sudden I was no longer getting sound through the Fire Stick. Picture was fine, just no sound. I spent quite a bit of time with Amazon support trying to resolve the issue, but never could. They kept trying to pin the problem on my TV, which made zero sense because I had not made any changes to the TV settings, and I was getting sound with cable. So when Prime Day rolled around in July, I bought another Fire Stick. I set it up with no problem and it works great. So, the problem with the other one was NOT my TV. We'll see how long the sound lasts with this one, but I'm happy with it.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
Has no storage download a few apps and you are out of storage. Alexa cant carry out very simple commands. You can not turn off the worst oral search I have used. They record your conversations and I have seen it get triggered by background noise. Even though you have very limited storage they wont let you delete any Amazon programs and Amazon prime tv is a joke now. If you want to rent s movie it'll be through Amazon or nothing. Piss poor android software. To delete Alexa recording you have to go online and try to locate it like everything else on Amazon the software is not user friendly nor accurate. Like when I'm Amazon shopping and it says you have 600 items from your search but when search from low to high price you now have only 22 and they dont have the lowest listed.,1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Works well but...I just wish Amazon would add programmable buttons on the remote so you could get straight into Netflix, Hulu, or another app. It would be awesome to be able to just go straight into whatever you programmed the button to do, without any other button pushing, including turning on your TV... Just hit the button and Boom! you're TV comes on and you're in Netflix or whatever it is you programmed the button to do.",3,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"I have multiple TV's in different geographic places. I have 2 Apple TV devices and 2 Firestick devices.  My goal at the outset of migrating from standard cable systems to streaming was to reduce overall cost. I started with my Apple investment to eliminate satellite services and leveraging my multi-decade investment in AT&T wireless. In the first two years using both AT&T investment in Directv Now combined with my AT&T wireless, the ROI was significant. Since I require high speed internet for my business, I prorated my multiple vendor isp costs appropriately. I decided to purchase the Firestick to test mobility between the Apple product and Amazon's. I find that Firestick travels better and moves around better when traveling. I just find a free HDMI port.  As we all know early adopters of streaming saw the best ROI's. As streaming vendors and the larger players in this market have adapted to the ""profit value of things""....the savings are now getting minimized.",5,1,2019-7-6,1,0,0
"The picture quality is good even though I have it connected to an economy TV set and I do enjoy it with one or two channels. Communicating with Alexa works fine. On the other hand, a frustrating problem with the Stick is that it is often ""iffy"" to be sure the telecast is the one showing in real time. Often some previous telecast is locked in. Then it's a challenge trying to obtain the real-time telecast. Another thing that surprised me was when I attempted to download a channel to the Stick that was part of my paid-for cable contract, I was asked to pay an additional fee. Also, I have still have not been able to load the local CBS, ABC or NBC channels to the Stick. I did not take advantage of the Sling trial promotion. Still experimenting with this product.Update - I drop this to 1 star - getting real-time telecast of fox news has become impossible.",3,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"The fire stick started my Alexa movement in my home. Where I once had a Roku ultra, which the earlier models didn't support 4k, so I upgraded. I haven't looked back since. It may sound trivial, however Alexa learned my TV and soundbar in a matter of seconds. I have since upgraded my lighting to smart bulbs, which makes my home feel like an episode of Star Trek. ""Alexa turn on all the lights"" and viola! All lights come on. Some people make the argument of how useful a cell phone has become, well I feel the new narrative is how we survived with out Alexa. My next upgrade is a Nest thermostat. The ease of use, integration, and cost to automate my home has been painless, cost effective and fun.This review was supposed to be about the fire stick, but Alexa is so much more than streaming device. So why I upgraded to the 4k stick to begin with, like I said, I had a Roku ultra, and my remote broke, so I bought a fire stick. The first thing I noticed was while watching 4k content, I couldn't game online. That was my first indication that I wasn't getting actual 4k content, I had to upgrade my router from an airport extreme to a Linksys 1730. That cleared up my bandwidth issues. Disney plus broadcasts in 4k UHD, which makes the movies amazing. If you are on the fence let me give you a few tid bits.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"It took me a long time to buy into this whole fire stick thing. I’m not technologically inclined so I figured it would be a hassle, AND my ex didn’t want to get rid of the overpriced DirectTV because of the football package they have on lock. Anyway, when I moved out on my own, it occurred to me I don’t want him much tv (maybe once a week) and definitely wasn’t paying cable prices. I ordered a set of fire sticks with my Prime account, and because I have Prime, that was the first thing loaded on my tv and it has tons of options for entertainment. I also have Hulu but have thought about canceling that because I don’t watch it as often as Prime.So, in short, amazing deal, super easy plug in and walk through set up, no cable bills - I’m forever sold.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,1,0
"I've had a few Firesticks, and they all work well.  Frankly, I don't notice an improved picture quality on the 4K version, but unless you are very close to the screen, 4K is often impossible to discern from traditional HD, so that is not Fire Stick's issue.  The voice commands work shockingly well.  The only problem I've had is that the Stick is powered by a USB jack, but the one that is built-in in the back of my TV apparently doesn't produce a strong enough current to power this stick, meaning that I have to run an extension cord to the back of my TV.  The directions warn that this might be the case.  I never had this issue with the original Sticks.  Thus, not a dealbreaker by any means, but perhaps an issue for some.",4,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
"Easy to navigate. Another great tool for viewing your favorite shows. I recently gave up my spectrum TV package and only have WiFi, because of another price increase.

Like local news, football games, some favorite TV shows. Utube has about everything. It's a must app. Thank you fire stick. I've cut my cable bill more than half.

If I could give zero stars I would.UPDATE: Tammie from Amazon called to help with the setup. With her help we got it set up. I will start exploring its capabilities. I am keeping one star knocked off because the instructions were so poor. But Tammie is contacting their engineering department to have them improve the instructions.",4,1,2018-11-10,1,1,0

"Amazon stopped supporting Sony, so we needed something else to keep watching.  We bought 2 of these and converted our home theater set up from RGB to HDMI using a new Yamaha receiver to switch between devices.  (We planned to add the second unit to an older TV)  There is not enough room between inputs to plug the Fire Stick in directly, so we use the extension cable that comes with the unit.  I have an extensive electronics and computer background, so I know that everything is connected correctly.  We have a solid 60 mbs internet speed through a wireless gigabit router.  Using other wireless devices does affect the Fire Stick one way or another.The Amazon Fire Sticks are a huge disappointment.  First and foremost, the picture keeps cutting in and out identically on both units, flickering between the picture and a black screen.  Rebooting sometimes solves the problem for a couple of hours, but it is not unusual have to reboot 2 to 5 times during a movie.  We have Cable and Blueray running through the same receiver and the problem is only with the Amazon Fire Sticks.  A web search suggested a hard reboot on the stick to clear it's cache, but that did nothing.  We've switched the Fire Stick to all of the different HDMI inputs with no improvement.  There is also a digital noise like static that shows up from time to time only in the Fire Stick video.  Again, we no issues with any of our other devices.",1,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
We will never buy another firestick. It cost us so much in data overages. There are only 2 of us in our home and we both work full time. We watch Netflix a little at night and some on the weekend.

"So I do not have just one firestick; I have four of them for my household.  I was tired of paying $5 a cable box for each of the bedrooms.  We still have cable but only in the main living room and we use the Amazon firestick in the main living room, master bedroom and two of the kid's bedrooms.  We download the main TV show apps and can connect to them through our cable so its like having all the stations, plus Amazon/Netflix, etc. all on one.  I think we use the firestick more than regular TV and my husband tries to get me to cancel cable because it is so expensive but I am still hesitant.This device is very easy to use.  Plug in, connect to wifi and you are good to go.  If there are any apps or services you have majority can be connected to the Firestick (like Netflix).  Like the voice command part because it makes looking for what I want to watch much easier especially for all my 5-year old cartoons.  I can say ""watch My Little Ponies"" and its there.  My 5-year-old has even learned to use it as well.  It does offer parental controls which is nice so the kids cannot purchase without approval.",5,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0

In addition, they're sending me a REFURBISHED RREMOTE? I didn't buy my parents a REFURBISHED SET, I bought them NEW and paid top price for it.

So I next tried the 4K firestick & it has EXACTLY the same issue.

Overall the Fire Stick is awesome. I have had no issues with the stick itself. Streaming quality is awesome with the apps from Amazon but third party apps are a hit or miss. Alexa integration is not a recommended choice for me but I just turn that feature off. I do like the newer remotes that can control my TV and the volume.

Quality is great! We even traded in our previous cable box only to go a week before the issue came back.  Second, we put one on our tv that sat unused because we're saving pennies and didn't want another 'rental box' fee.  Now we have another TV to use!  APPS that are available to the Firestick are quite varied, I was happy to get an all day news network back which our basic cable package can't even do.

"I got this device to hopefully make it easier to stream Disney+. What I didn't realize was how much easier it woud be to stream just about any service I use. (I've been using Chromecast up until now which is like pulling teeth) With the remote control, voice commands and integration with so many streaming services, Fire TV beats Chromecast hands down. I haven't had this for very long, but I've probably streamed more with it in the last few weeks than I did with Chromacast over several years. Chromecast was always having issues when I tried to stream.

In its beneficence Amazon gave me a $24 dollar allowance toward the purchase.  The device does perform well although However, I must access another step to open the Firestick's contents.

They graciously offered me a discount but not nearly as low as it was offered the weeks prior. However, what choice did I have, so.... Anyway, it required using the HDM1 port and since I already have that in use by an integrated sound system I have to resort to unplugging it and plugging in the Firestick whenever I want to stream Netflix or Amazon Videos.  If that isn't bad enough, I find the remote very ""old school"" - limited command functions and using voice totally confuses my dog and trying to talk to the stupid dog and stupid Alexis is just way too complicated.",3,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0

What we ended up with was clumsy to use, convoluted to access (via voice activation), and just not worth it, so we returned the Fire TV stick and haven't regretted that not once.

Voice recognition is not perfect but still very useful and works under YouTube search as well.  Navigation feels quick/normal and not at all sluggish.  I have mostly used for YouTube so far and noticed audio-video synchronization issue often but eventually they catch up but until then it is distracting.  I am not sure if that is YouTube issue or this device.  I, however, haven't noticed this issue in Roku premium.  Another advantage is that this version of stick works in many countries. The HDMI connection cable that comes with Fire TV Stick is little short and having little longer would help place the stick properly instead of dangling between this cable and power cable.Overall, this is a good device especially if it can be purchased on sale.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0

This one was purchased simply because we have a new tv.  We know the drill, what it does, the interface, etc.  We were hoping streaming might be faster, but didn’t expect miracles. We were wrong. This is significantly faster AND the picture is improved. Alexa is fully integrated, making voice recognition seamless. The older fire stick got moved to the new tv, so this isn’t a matter of a new tv making the fire stick seem better than it is. The comparison is on the tv that had the older generation.

My only issue with this product is that most of the 'apps' I want are not free, and cost big money! Make sure you keep the original packaging that the Fire Stik 4K comes in, so when you travel you don't lose any pieces. I think the packaging is very ingeniously laid out.

Not everyone thinks about where their HDMI ports are on their TV when purchasing items for it.Next-I used to use Prime TV through my xbox.  Now, I have this connected to my tv and my cable through xbox.  I got the bundle so I also got and Echo Dot, and I saw ""Alexa tell my xbox to turn on/off"" and boom-done.  The remote that comes with this also has the voice capability, so you can command what to watch and which app to use.  Netflix, Hulu, all the major streaming services and networks such as HBO (if you already have through cable youre good, otherwise a cheap monthly subscription works amazing) as any other gadget, and when compared to the ever popular device that begins with R and has four letters, it's almost a lough out loud joke.

Our batteries last on average 2-3 weeks in the remote (brand name, newly purchased batteries) and then the remote simply dies.Yes, it's possible to use your phone as a remote, but what's the point?",1,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"So admittedly I should have read more reviews & chosen better, but I'm not thrilled with this.The good: Everything works fine, I added my netflix, hulu & disney accounts easily enough, the actual physical setup was no problem.

"First, I love the Fire Stick.  It enables me to download pretty much any app and view on my older Samsung TV.  I have an older version (5 years old at least) of the Fire Stick.  It worked fine for me on my 5-7 year old Samsung TV.  However, I found it would often pixelate and took a while to load the already downloaded app.  Sometimes it would not recognize the command, and start again.  However, it did work and there were times it was great.  I did notice that if I am watching on an app, stop the play, and either back out to Home page, or just turn tv off for the night, when I turned on the TV in the morning to watch cable, the cable shows were pixelating.  Now, with the new Fire Stick 4K, I can move through the app selections quickly, no pixelating on the Fire Stick programs, Not having to reboot the system often, and it is just so much stronger!  I still have the pixelating when I go back to cable though.  I am reveiwing this as I wanted to let others know that upgrading to this version, regardless if you have a 4K TV or not is smart.  It will speed things up.  By the way: the Alexa voice control is so much faster!  I get to the Home Page, hit the button on the remote and say ""Continue playing Entourage on Amazon Prime"", release button and it opens Entourage at the exact spot I left off!  Now it did have an issue with me saying ""Play Entourage Movie"".  It took me back to the series.  I beleive that is a ""same name title"" issue.  I have not setup the Alexa voice controls for FIre Stick yet either so I suspect it will get better.  Bought on Black Friday, installed about 1.5 weeks later, so been using about 3 - 4 weeks.  Love it!  Happy I took the chance.  Bought this on a whim that upgrading would resolve some of the pixelating and rebooting. Wifi is 5 feet from this TV so no excuse for slow bandwidth other than technology upgrade.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Being used to a Roku, I find the Firestick interface clumsy.  It's also kind of a pain having to ""purchase"" (no charge) each app to put on the Firestick.  I bought this device mainly because Amazon was discontinuing streaming support for Amazon Prime on my 8 year old Sony Blu-Ray play and they offered a $25 discount on the Firestick.  Unfortunately I had a purchase deadline date to use the credit and by the time I had a chance to actually unpack the device and hook it up and test it, I was past my return window with Amazon.Another annoying feature is that the Firestick apparently requires more power to operate from the USB cord than the Roku does.  My Roku works just fine with it plugged into the USB port on the TV, but the Firestick won't work unless I plug the USB into the wall adapter.  For the TV that I have it hooked up to, that's OK as it sits on a cabinet and I have a powerstrip handy.  But, if it was being used on my living room TV it would be a problem as it's wall mounted and I'd have to run another power source up the wall to use it.",3,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0
"The Firestick 4K has impressive streaming performance and is very responsive without delays and has an excellent user interface but I have experienced problems with the Alexa voice control.  On one Firestick 4K, the Alexa voice control part of the remote just stopped working one day  There was not even a beep anymore when holding down the microphone button.  A factory reset did not fix the  problem.  Neither did replacing the batteries in the remote.  Only using a brand new Firestick 4K fixed the problem.  I have also found that if the ac adapter for the Firestick 4K is unplugged and plugged back in again that it can take a minute or two for the Alexa voice control to start working again.",3,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I have a old Samsung TV and none of the apps are updating and had a lot of issues with volume not working sometimes after the software update. I decided to give fire tv a try, since it’s a 4K tv with Dolby support and results couldn’t have been better, I now have all the apps which were either not supported or obsolete on my TV, before I used to connect my laptop for everything but I can simply cast it to tv without any issues if required.Another important issue was with sound, I don’t use sound bar and sometimes it was very hard to hear dialogues, that issue was also resolved after changing the sound settings to always Dolby digital.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"I own the original FireTV Stick and it was showing its age.  This one is faster so has a much better user experience.  The UI has also improved with the faster CPU allowing it to do more, but still responsive.  I do still see occasional double or triple key press.  E.g. I pressed the Back button once, and it act as if I pressed it twice or even three times and exit from what I was watching all the way to the Home screen again.  That can be annoying!  Perhaps a bug in the software?Otherwise, the streaming, video and sound is great.  I like that it integrates well with my stereo system and TV.  I can use just the remote for all 3: FireTV Stick, TV and stereo while watching.  Keep improving the hardware and software Amazon.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0

"I was skeptical of the reviews that raved about how easy this thing is to install.  They are all accurate.  You do not need to be a tech person for this.  You have to be able to open the box, plug it in and turn it on.  Seriously, that's about it.  Literally a 5 minute max install.Ok, I was even more skeptical of the quality of the stream. I am a video quality nerd.  If you are like me, you know when your video is HD or not.  If you are not like that, that's fine and then you really don't have anything to worry about with the Firestick.  I was blown away by the video quality.  It really is awesome.  Caveat: I have really only watched the Amazon Prime video content - that is the video quality I am referring to.  I will now begin exploring my other cord-cutting options and update my review once I have a Hulu or Sling or some other similar service.",5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0

"This device has potential to be great, but is hindered by a terribly cluttered UI and technical issues. Starting with the UI, 90% of what you see are advertisements for various amazon services or sponsored apps. You really have to dig through a ton of garbage to get to where you want to be. Sometimes half of the screen is covered by an advertisement.As for technical issues, we had problems with ours losing audio until the stick was restarted. This would happen with every use after about 30 minutes. Additionally, we had issues with remote connectivity; it was so bad that you could barely type anything because it either wouldn't respond or would act as if you clicked 20 times.",3,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"I have owned Roku and Chromecast. I like the options the Firestick has, it says that you need a certain amount of power from your usb plug in your TV if you are going to use that as your electrical outlet. Well my TV is not rated for the amount of power the firestick states it needs but it still works powering the device (that's a plus). The only downside I would say is that I find the Firestick will sometimes not connect to my soundbar or if I switch to my satellite from the firestick, it won't transfer the sound over. But that is easily (and annoyingly) resolved by shutting off the TV and turning it back on. All in all, I think it is better than the other streaming devices I have used.",4,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"We bought this to replace a two year old Roku that keeps giving us some “protected content HDMI copyright message”. The Roku thing is ridiculous and not the first time it has done it, it either doesn’t like our Denon receiver or Panasonic projector or the very nice HDMI cables we use, the fix is unplugging everything power and HDMI and reconnecting in a specific order. Our stuff is all hung from the ceiling and this procedure just sucks. So bye bye Roku! We have to other Firesticks in other parts of the house and they are excellent much faster than the smart TV’s they are connected to. This new version is much faster than those other units and that is on WiFi the Ethernet adapter hasn’t come yet for this one. Which is my only gripe- just make it accept an Ethernet cable from the factory, everyone else’s does and who really wants to tie up WiFi for a TV? I recommend it",5,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
"We bought this to replace our old fire stick. We had no issues with the old one but we decided to pass it on to our kids for the new tv we got them for their bedroom. We love the fire stick and were definitely excited to upgrade to a new one. BUT the new one doesn’t work 😂 The home button doesn’t do anything. I fiddled with the settings tonight and it still doesn’t work. Went to advanced settings and clicked on the home button option. It states “if pressing the home button on the remote does not bring you automatically to the Fire TV home screen enable this setting.” Ok, so I enabled the setting. The home button still doesn’t work. Worst yet, the Alexa feature doesn’t work at all. Nothing. I ask Alexa to find a show for me and the light on the remote just flashes blue and nothing happens. I’ll be reaching out for tech service regarding these issues tomorrow but will likely just return it as I’m thinking we must’ve received a defective remote 🤨 Gave it a star because it’s super fast!",1,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
I bought two of these. One was to replace the older gen 1080P version and the other to replace our travel fire stick. Glad we did as the last place we went had a 4k TV. This looked great and performed perfectly. Its even better now that Youtube TV is available on amazon. Directv now or ATTnow works great on it. Having our movies with us with movies anywhere is a bonus. I would highly recomend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive streaming device.,5,1,2019-10-15,1,1,0
"The fire stick is decent, but it has many flaws that simply cause me to seek alternatives for future purchases.  The device itself is slower than I’d like.  When I use similar capabilities on other devices like LG tv or Roku, it is faster.  There’s also very little space with which to install apps.  It is constantly asking me to delete other apps.  And the most annoying part of using is that all content is oriented to amazon prime movies and shows.  I want to use other apps to rent movies, only to find that amazon will not allow competing apps to provide rental material to users.  Apps like Vudu and movies anywhere can’t be used to rent movies.  The proprietary aspect of this just takes away from the user experience.  Other devices just don’t prevent user choice like fire products.",3,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0

When my allegedly Smart DVD player through which I stream Prime Video and Netflix began to have trouble connecting to the wifi router in my home and would routinely freeze when navigating through Prime, I decided it was time to try the Fire Stick.  The Stick hasn't lost contact with the wifi even when the Dot has.  There is no hesitation or delay in streaming.  Navigating within selected programs (fast forwarding and reversing) is smooth and glitchless.  The picture is clear and vivid.  I could kick myself for not doing this sooner.

"We cut the cable cord over 7 years ago and have never looked back using Fire TV. We initially took the step in between moves and were only going to do this temporarily for three months until our permanent residence was ready. We even wrote down the names of our beloved shows and what episode we were on. We made the move and we realized cable was not available in our area. So we continued cable free using only Fire TV and an antenna. Our intention was once we got tired of Prime or watched everything we would add on Hulu, Netflix or the likes. Seven years later and we are still satisfied with Fire TV. We recently upgraded to a fire stick and love it more than the box. At times we have slight lag time or buffering but not often. Cut the cord and buy this! Great deal!",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"So I’ve been presently surprised by this little gadget. I bought it for my “smart” tv in my basement that wouldn’t allow me to stream Hulu.

They both have volume control but the Fire has a mute option which is an improvement.The Roku remote has buttons for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, DirectV Now, Sling. This bypasses several steps that are required by the Fire stick. The Roku has software for your apps so you can arrange them with the ones most frequently used on top.

We spend over$140 a month on DirecTV with a dish, and that's it! No internet, no premium channels, no pay per view...what a ripoff! I decided to give this a try, but my other obstacle is that we also have only 2 providers of high speed internet (they are also astronomically expensive). We have T-mobile as our cell carrier, so I decided to try using the firestick with a mobile hotspot. I am happy to say that it worked! After we get through a few transitions in our home (in-laws move into their new house a few hundred feet away on the farm and hubby and I get the farmhouse to ourselves finally!) we will be getting DirecTV now. I did a trial with DirecTV now and the fire stick and everything worked well on the hotspot!

"What I love is this Amazon 4K streaming stick figures at all your attached devices i.e.: TV Soundbar etc. and you can control all devices from its remote. It is a nice remote control with Alexa voice control and mute and volume control of soundbar or TV.What I don't love is this UI is screwy with no real control over the various apps and how they are arraigned.  Too much screen real estate is given to Amazon advertising. The search is not global to all apps or channels. It doesn't seem to remember what you are watching. Come on Amazon you can win with superior hardware, but not if you make me feel ""facebooked"".",3,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0

Now if that's not enough, the improved clarity is immediately noticeable. I still have just a HD TV and a smartphone with hotspot but the upgrade is well worth the extra fews dollars.

There is a whole world of entertainment to be had for far less than the old price Dish and DirecTV charge per month for their pretty basic services.  I have had either Dish or DirecTV for at least 20 years and after my current contract ends I won't be going back to them any time soon unless they DRASTICALLY reduce their cost of services.  Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa Voice Remote, streaming media player is a pretty awesome product that is a easy gateway to streaming video services and applications.

"So I already had a 4K Firestick but decided to get a possible upgrade, I had been using the newer one since my older standard Firestick kept overheating.  Well now it seems that this ""new"" model of stick itself is faulty and incorrectly advertising, the picture shows a newer remote type with a light indicator but the devices within the box are of the previous version of 4K sticks.  So we have a bit of false advertising and faulty products on our hands.As stated my previous 4K had zero problems like this, and based on what I'm seeing it's not a matter of overheating like the standard Firestick, touching it I can not note any obvious temperatures beyond what it normally operates at.  However within just today, watching shows on Christmas Eve at home it has restarted on its own 3 separate times while mid show.  I'm not sure if it's just a matter of getting a lemon but I also got my parents a ""New"" 4K Firestick and they are having different issues plus again the remote appears to be of the older version without the LED indicator on the remote.  It would seem to me that Amazon had surplus of a previous 4K sticks in stock but had already printed out the newer boxes and they figured no one would notice.

"Streams fine with my Wi-Fi hotspot, as long as I have at least 2 bars (I live in a rural area);  lots more apps available than the older model of the Amazon Firestick.  I like the older model enough that I decided to buy 2 more for 2 additional TV's;  we are not interested in the voice or ""Alexa"" features, so I was happy to find out the ""Alexa"" part only turns on if you hold down the microphone button, it is not continuously monitoring all of the sounds in your house as a regular Alexa might.  I also was happy that all of the apps I already have (like Hulu, AT&T TV Now, and Amazon Prime) automatically set up on the new Fire Sticks as soon as I downloaded them - I didn't have to input passwords, etc. - based on being purchased by and/or registered to me.  The one I gave to my husband, he just had to register to himself, and it set up with the apps that he owns & watches.One could probably move the Fire Stick from one TV to another, but we find that inconvenient due to our TVs all being mounted on the wall, and having to pull the TV out from the wall and perform minor gymnastics to plug it into the HDMI (or other) port.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0

After a software update, I was finally able to successfully get connected to the internet.  The only answer I could get on why this happened was ""it's a technical issue.""

I’ve been a Prime member for a long time, but haven’t really utilized all the benefits - until now.  This was extremely easy to set up, although I had to look online for instructions because Amazon didn’t include any, which I thought was really strange. Now I have Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube as well as Prime, and I couldn’t be happier. I Bluetoothed my TV to my stereo, and it’s like being in the first row at a concert. You even have net access as well, almost making my computer obsolete. Buying a Firestick is so much cheaper and economical than buying a smart TV. It’s hard to believe that little stick does all that it does. And I have absolutely no issues with connectivity or buffering, as I do with my Mac. My only complaint is that I’m sorry I didn’t buy one sooner. Should I decide to buy a flat screen for the bedroom, I will definitely buy another Firestick to go along with it.",5,1,2019-4-21,1,0,0

I'm a gadgets lover. I like to try everything. But I found ROKU to be more reliable with cleaner interface (No, I don't work for ROKU).  Not all movies on fire stick are free so you gotta be careful of what you're clicking. I really hope the engineers are looking into fixing these issues soon. From reading on several forums.

"This is an excellent streaming stick with easy set-up, solid connectivity and snappy response.  My one annoyance is that because the remote has so few buttons, the way they work varies from app to app, especially the fast forward and rewind.  Sometimes it skips ahead or back 10 seconds (nice) but sometimes it simply changes the FF or RW speed (4x, 16x, etc.) Maybe this is the fault of the different Fire streaming services app developers, but I wish Amazon would enforce consistency.  Its a pain to have to learn the quirks of each app.  Amazon devices are also heavy with unwanted  advertising on the home screen that take up valuable real estate, but are generally easy to bypass or ignore.",4,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"Since Amazon advised they would no longer support streaming through my current DVR device, I purchased this using an Amazon special coupon for $25.  The product arrived quickly.  It was easy enough to install attaching the fire stick to my TV and outlets.  That's where the simplicity ends.  The remote required numerous attempts to simply get the battery cover off it was so tight.  After complete hookup, I noticed the process to stream requires the use of my Directv remote, the Alexa remote and my TV remote.  I thought I was doing something wrong, but Tech Support advised unfortunately that is the only way to stream.  So now to watch any Amazon, I am back to multiple remotes.  On top of all of this, my Soundbar, as confirmed by the Amazon Tech Support is correctly configured but simply doesn't work with the Firestick and they offered no explanation other than maybe its not compatible, which it is listed on their setup, or my Soundbar is not plugged into the TV, which it is.  They said they would escalate, but no callback to date.",2,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
I purchased this to add to an existing older smart tv. Some apps were no longer supported and it was fairly slow.

First thing we noticed : no more square box. Looks suspiciously like any regular Amazon Fire stick. But this one is really on fire. First off it connects to the latest 5G WiFi which improves the speed exponentially. The clicks are quieter. Big point is that the Fire remote now controls not only the unit itself but the TV and the sound bar as well.  No more looking for remotes when to turn things on or off. One button does it all. Also the volume is controlled by the Amazon remote. Talking about improvements!. Job well done, Amazon.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Very glad with my choice to cut the cord & go with the Fire TV Stick. Setup needed just a little more explanation about setting the correct input. I called support for registration since i did not realize I hadn't switched input to HDMI, so u could call it user error. Support was really helpful and patient. No extra charges as u get with cable services.  This 'input issue' was probably a no-brainer but I have only had cable since 1978 and I have not messed much with a DVD or other media for the TV nor the satellite fascination 15 years ago. (Trying to stress how new I am to this and how easy it was)I do need to reset the stick periodically when I get a 'no signal' message yet my internet is good.

Bought this fire stick mostly just to get Amazon photos on my tv.  I'm impressed with how fast this is over wireless AC as the pictures change quick.  Nothing negative about it so far.  I don't really need any other part of the fire stick except for the photos as my TV has amazon prime.  The games are kind of a nice feature for kids though.  All in all pretty nice little device.  I've got a Roku Ultra because I thought it would get my xfinity cable channels but in reality this is about the same but better because I can get amazon photos.  The Roku was so buggy with xfinity it was useless so actually I never use it.  I don't watch a lot of movies but I like doing slide shows of my pictures for family.  So that's why I bought the fire stick 4k.  Nice hardware.,5,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"If I could give this zero stars, I’d give it just that. I have an old firestick, which I have loved. However, the new ones don’t work with my tv. I have a 4K Vizio. If you turn the volume up or down (on the firestick remote, tv remote, or sound bar remote) the screen will go black and the firestick freezes. You’ll have to turn the tv off and back on to get it back. I went through three of these things, NONE of them were compatible. I’m assuming it has something to do with the volume control on the new firestick, but no one from amazon had “ever heard of this happening.” I’m sorry, but I find that really hard to believe that it’s just my television with the issue. Amazon needs to make this product compatible with all televisions, or just not sell the product. -100/10 would recommend.",1,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
This is by far the worst experience I've had with any firestick. I have purchased at least 8 for myself and as gifts. I've had issues with it since day 1.1. It wouldn't mirror from any other device.,1,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Works great!Only problem is that you will need a pair of sticky rubber gloves, a pair of forceps, super glue, a herd of Bolivian fire ants, and a lot of cuss words to get the battery cover off. Don't worry though, there are YouTube videos available to help you get the battery cover off (yes, I'm completely serious, there are LOTS of videos on this) but the videos will be of no help. You are on your own when it comes to trying to put the batteries in. Do yourself a favor and buy REALLY, REALLY GOOD batteries so that they last a good long time. Maybe by then your PTSD will have gotten better and you'll be able to cope better the next time you have to take that cover off.",4,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"The remote on this thing lacks decent rewind/forward controls.  Pressing either rewind or forward buttons moves 10 seconds in the relative direction.  That might not sound like a big deal, but it is if you have trouble understanding what was said in a particular part and replay it repeatedly to try and figure it out.  In such cases, you really want a more refined control of how far back it goes.  You can tell the remote precisely how far back to go, but that can be annoying in its own way, particularly if you're not quite certain just how far back you want to go.  It would be so much easier to just be able to hit the rewind button and have it go back until you tell it to stop.  I'd have given it 4 stars if the remote were better.Also, with all the emphasis on voice controls, people forget that they don't feel like speaking when they get sick (as it may actually be painful), but they do like to watch tv.",3,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"Lived in hotels for over a month and got sick of the limited television options. Because of the difficulty of connecting to hotel hot spots that require information entered on a website the Amazon Fire TV stick was the perfect choice. It never failed to connect to the hotel WiFi and launch the website to finish the connection. Streaming usually worked great even when the Internet connection was questionable. Wished I had bought this earlier. Being able to watch television shows and movies on Prime, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube and Disney+ kept my sanity on nights and weekends held up in a hotel room.  Will never travel again without one. Switching WiFi settings and Television controls was quite easy once you did it once or twice. Even back at home I've replaced an older streaming device and continue to use this great product. Worth every penny spent.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0
"We purchased the Firestick in April 2019 and it started having problems streaming by July.  The images and audio would freeze every 10 to 15 minutes for about 5 minutes unless we click out and back into the channel.  I thought for a while it was our internet service so I didn't say anything.  Finally my husband got frustrated and hooked up our Roku and everything worked fine.  We again tried the Firestick and again the problem returned so it turned out that it was the Firestick and not my internet.  The Firestick is a neat idea because it turns the TV on/off, has volume and I can change the channels on the AT&T TV all with one remote but the intermittent service is sooo annoying.",2,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"Have had a fire tv/sticks almost since they came out and continue to upgrade as they make better versions. The device it self works perfectly but the current remote design is a failure, the sliding cover on the back failed to hold it self on very quickly and I had to buy a silicone sleeve to fix the constant falling off. One of the older fire stick remotes I have used that design and it has lasted years so I know it can be made better.",4,1,2019-8-5,1,1,0
"TV streaming sticks have come a long way in a few years. The Fire Stick 4K is a small and powerful streamer that comes with nice accessories like and HDMI extender so that it can be used in a variety of situations. The remote works well even with the stick out of line-of-sight as is intended. Being an Amazon product it promotes Amazon content more upfront than other content but is still very easy to use and has excellent image quality. It does Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and HDR flavors all for $35 when it is on sale. My biggest problem is that has audio dropouts a couple of times an hour, sometimes more often. The audio will cut out for 1 - 2 seconds then return. The picture remains unaffected, just the sound cuts out. It will sometimes lose lip sync after one of these dropouts. Hopefully there is a firmware fix for this coming soon. A very sweet device that is just a step or two away from being a great device.",4,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0
"Never worked well. I put up with this item restarting randomly for over 10 months before calling Amazon for assistance. After walking me through troubleshooting (the same steps I had completed numerous times) a rep determined the remote was to blame and sent me a replacement remote.

"I have an older firestick in my son's room because he doesn't have a cable box, but when we subscribed to [the all-powerful mouse company]+ it was the only subscription service that our cable provider does not have an app for. So I needed a way to get the service to our family room (Which doesn't have a smart TV). So I waited for a sale, I didn't need the 4K capability for this TV but it was on a great deal, and I would rather future-proof to some extent. When I hooked this up, man was I impressed with how far the technology has improved since I bought my last firestick. This thing is way faster and basically makes any TV into a Smart TV. I am on the verge of adding a new TV set up in our master bedroom and I will be adding another one.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"I was looking to replace my Roku as I have never been a fan of their remote and interface. Amazon beats ROKU on every detail except the most important one: stream quality.

I finally unplugged the firestick and switched back to the ROKU, and boom. Not one steaming issue. Very disappointed.",1,1,2019-7-21,1,3,0
"My previous Firestick was acting a bit ""funky"" so I made my regular online trip to Amazon to check on prices. I read about the 4K Firestick, saw the price, read the reviews and the option to pay $10.00 a month for 5 months and it became a no brainer. I don't know if it's just me, but there also seem to be more free apps. I can get all my favorite TV stations via this Firestick so I'm going to be downgrading my cable TV, which will save me $$$. Setup was a breeze, even though there weren't any instructions in the box - received them via e-mail (a little odd). The picture is superb. Sound is great. My only complaint is that Amazon needs to redesign the way the back of the Firestick comes off....but if you already own an older model, you know the secret for this!! And Siri will find what you're looking for.Oh goodness - I've finally entered the 21st century!",5,1,2019-2-8,1,0,0

"I'm not saying that the firestick isn't a good thing--just that it's not working well in my situation.  I have a service that will often dip to 3g and at those frequent times my firestick will simply not load anything.  When I receive 4 g service on my router, it works pretty well, except I (and this is probably my fault) don't have much luck searching.  Sorry, I'm just not real happy with it--according to reviews, it works great, but as it comes without any kind of instructions I just don't enjoy trying to figure it out for myself, (no matter how simple it probably would be if I had something to go by ) and therefore don't get nearly as much as I think I should out of it.",3,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I really appreciate the Amazon fire stick. My cable bill had elevated to the point where I no longer felt that it was an investment that I wanted to make. The channel selection and my TV watching habits did not warrant paying $120.00 monthly. While considering other options I ran across the fire stick and took the plunge. It was easy to setup, offered enough programming for me. Works on all of my OLD TVs. All that is required is HDMI port. Picture clarity is excellent. The purchase included a free trial for Hulu. I plan to subscribe to Hulu + live tv in order to get local channels and sports for my hubby. Still this will mean cutting my cable bill in half. I do wonder about the “life” of the fire stick but for $35.00, even if it lasts only a couple of years, I’ll consider I got my money’s worth.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"Before I start, I would like to say that after hyping up the new 4K Firestick, A Close Friend went ahead and ordered 2 to replace his 2nd generation sticks. I was a little concerned at first because after watching review on this product, they talked about the wonderful job Amazon did revamping the WiFi on the 3rd Generation. I'm die hard Ethernet and I was worried. My 2nd Generation might see 61 Mbps on a 300 Mbps Connection. Boy, was I surprised. With the 3rd Generation, I'm getting constant speeds of 96 Mbps Down and I am now able to watch HD almost flawlessly. The Redesign of the remote was almost well thought. I don't feel there was a need for a ""Mute"" button. When I get a call or someone shows up, I just ""Pause"" what I am watching. It is my opinion that instead of a ""Mute"" Button, an ""Input Button"" would have been a more practical choice in design. All in all, I love my 3rd Generation Firestick and will continue to recommend it to friends. It's A Keeper!",5,1,2018-12-8,1,0,0
"Love the Fire Stick! The app isn't as easy to use as Roku since finding your channels is rather buried. All the programming is available but picking a specific network to watch requires just a bit more effort. I suspect that's why it has the voice interface. I'll have to give that a try next. Overall it's a good product!One thing to note: It actually came packaged with the extension cable that allows it to fit on a TV with minimal clearance between the casing and the port. Wish I'd known that when I ordered. Knowing this would be too long to fit in the small space, I ordered that extension cable separately. I'm sure it'll be useful when I connect something else up so I'm going to keep the extra.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"No matter what I do, the Fire TV Stick takes control of the ""TV"" name for Alexa, overriding specific group and device names.  Worse still, it does this in a way that DOES NOT WORK.  Since adding the Fire TV Stick to the TV in the basement, ""Alexa, turn on TV"" gives a ""Provider is having difficulty"" response, instead of turning on the living room TV like it was configured to do.  It would almost be acceptable if it actually turned on the basement TV (though I guess you're screwed if you have multiple Fire TV devices), but it doesn't.  I can't find any way to disable this malfunctionality, either, so it's getting returned.  Sad when Amazon's own ecosystem isn't compatible with itself.",1,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0

I did my own troubleshooting to see if I could correct the issue myself (changing HDMI ports on the tv, changing electrical outlets, etc.) Nothing worked. After I unplug then replug it, it turns on for about 15 seconds then goes black again. Everytime. I guess I just got a dud...

Anyway, I have another amazon fire stick and it's working great. So glad I got rid of my cable company that has been ripping me off for years. Done with that. This is the best. Have so many movies and shows to watch. My cable internet is $64.25, and with some of the channels I purchased, my total bill for internet and amazon fire stick tv is now $88.22 all together, was paying $184 with the cable company. I have more channels then I could ever watch.

"We bought one for the bedroom to stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.  Loved it so much I got one for the living room (easier than streaming through the blu-ray).

So easy to set up.  I don't use any other Alexa device, but the voice recognition on the remote works well.  I'm not a fan of ""talking"" to electronics.  I also ordered some of the silicone cases to cover the remotes - they are small and slippery.  Mine cover most of the remote but if I get any replacements I'll probably go for the ones that cover all the buttons too - they are small and will probably get dust/cat fur around them.  The 2 I have are also supposed to glow in the dark, but I am not finding that the glow effect lasts long enough to be worth it.

"As the owner of an older Sony TV that was discontinuing a built-in feature allowing access to Amazon Prime video, I received a $25 discount which allowed me to buy the Fire TV Stick 4K inexpensively.

I didn't check for updates, which might have helped, but I figured for the sale price, she would at least have one with a working remote. Needless to say, this is MUCH better. She has some very basic, original internet plan with 5 or 15 Mbps download speed, so I doubt she's going to get much in 4k, but the voice remote is great for my mom when she needs to appease my nephews quickly with some cartoons.

I love the browser capability so I can use Firefox on the big screen so everyone can see what I what to show them without tying up a laptop and streaming it to the tv.

If you want higher VPN bandwidth, you can use a dedicated VPN router that will offload the stick from this chore.This device also comes with a cool remote control but what's cooler is that it integrates with my Samsung TV's remote control very nicely, so that only one remote is needed to control TV and stick.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0

"Love everything about this fire stick! Very intuitive and after 2 weeks of dealing with tha local cable company I needed this to work for me. And hallelujah it did. It was very easy as well. I needed that in my life. You do need a good internet connection, I have not dropped a signal yet. Which is amazing. I dropped cable and went with YouTubeTV. Which is amazing itself. Local channels, plus loads of extra, multiple viewers aloud, recording. Streaming with this fire stick is huge for me! Let's not forget Netflix..everything is all in one place and very simple remote. I can't recommend this enough. I will add I did use the included wifi extender I believe it's called and it works like a dream!",5,1,2019-11-18,1,1,0
"Its astonishing to me that I was not made aware of this before purchasing since this is an easy-peasy great feature of ROKU. Just pair your earpods or bluetooth headphones to the iPhone Roku App and boom, you can both listen to whatever is playing, together, in Private Listening Mode, while not disturbing the neighbors/late at night. Its bamboozling. How could a streaming device not offer this feature?  Am seriously considering return. The deal breaker may also be that, if you manage to pair even ONE set of bluetooth headphones to your Firestick, you still CAN'T CONTROL THE VOLUME. (At least without jumping through numerous hoops, download this download that....Ridiculous. Very unhappy.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"This thing is small and hides behind your TV. There are no exposed wires hanging from the back to a box. It is fast. You click on an app and you are there. Movies play quickly and does not freeze up. If your internet does it's job, the firestick will do his. Adding other apps is EASY with a capital E. I had ROKU for almost a decade and you could add other things, but only what ROKU decided what they wanted you to have. The remote with Alexa, volume and power buttons will change your life. You do not need another remote if the firestick is your method of watching TV. Alexa works very well and will do almost anything you want her too. You can even browse and order things from AMAZON straight through the firestick :-)All in all, the firestick is great and for $40, I don't believe it can be beat.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"We had the previous FireStick, and it sucked. It was hard to find what we were looking for. As for switching between cable and FireStick? Fuggetaboutit. The new version is what we expected. Switching between cable and FireStick is a snap. Finding programs is a snap. (Note: many of the offerings require a paid subscription.) One of the main reasons we got it was to effortlessly find programs on Netflix and Amazon Prime, but we've discovered lots of other options we didn't know about. The remote makes navigating easy. Plus the voice command on the remote makes finding any program on any service easy to find--including selecting a season. My wife loves British TV, and FireStick has her in hog heaven.",5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
"Have the old Fire stick and it seems to have gotten really slow so upgraded to this one. Much better quicker and has a couple more apps to download that were free and have some good shows. It's definitely worth the money. Have saved a small fortune getting rid of cable, getting just an 11.00 antenna and a fire stick.  I adventually added Netflix but still am saving money, watching all my local channels and  can pick what movies to watch.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
"I turned in all of my cable boxes this past summer, as I'm sick of the rising costs. I'm left with one in the living room downstairs and have limited channels. I previously bought a regular Fire Stick for that same TV and love it. I decided to go with the 4K on my bedroom TV because it has volume control on the remote. It's an older LG plasma, but was simple to hook up and get it all programmed and ready to go. I got my original Fire Stick on sale during Black Friday and only paid $20 for it, so I was a bit disappointed to have to pay $50 for this one, but really...I've saved more than that just ditching all the cable boxes, and the one time fee for the unit pays for itself the first time you use it. Not to mention not having to spend hundreds on a smart tv :D Definitely worth the money!",5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0
"After months of struggling with the horrible cox DVR that came with my budget I-don't-really-watch-TV-that-much cable account, I finally ditched live TV and went all in for streaming with Kindle Fire. I was pretty much amazed by how much the technology has improved since my old Roku. The remote trained itself to turn my TV no and off and control the sound bar volume (How?? After hours of trying, I couldn't get the cable remote to do that?) - and the apps (like netflix) on the kindlefire work TONS better than the native apps on my smart Samsung TV. I do find the home screen..which is not exactly in an app but not exactly ...um where? a bit disorganized. But since I can just ask the remote to go to an app it's a small issue.",5,1,2019-1-27,1,1,0
"So I was really excited to purchase this but unfortunately it is not what I had hoped. Right off the back the volume and power button didn't work, I figured it wasn't a big deal  I could still hear everything I just couldn't adjust it with the fire remote and thought maybe it was because my TV was programed to a different remote. I found out it was just the remote was broken, when I get about 4in away from my TV it works! Then it started messing up every time I'd try to watch Netflix. Netflix would work on every other device in the house. Now I can't even use it because the volume doesn't work at all on it. Absolutely no sound. If I change the channel to the Nintendo or regular TV I have sound but not for the fire stick. Going to buy a Roku. I know two people who have them and haven't had these issues.",1,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"I decided to cut the cable but not all at once. I started with 1 Fire TV stick to try it out. I then moved into a house that did not have coax cable in any of the bedrooms and so I then purchased the Fire HD box and a good outside antenna. The video quality is great and instead of running co-ax cable to all the bedrooms I purchased 2 more Fire TV sticks and I am glad I did. The video and audio quality with the fire TV stick is as good as cable without the expensive cable bill. I have since cut the cord and saving over $150.00 a month using both the Fire TV stick and the Fire HD box If you are thinking about buying it, just do it and you will be amazed and glad that you did.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I have an older fire stick on the living room TV, and decided to make the old LG plasma in the bedroom 'smart'.  I had just finished setting it up when my wife walked in the room and asked what I did to the TV...  It looks amazing!  Some of the simple things that amazon has added are great;  the stick realized that I already had another stick in the house, so was able to auto-connect to a password protected router (that was unexpected).  It also 'knew' what TV I had plugged it in to, and automatically implemented the volume button on the remote instead of making me figure out which 4 digit code was associated with my ancient TV.  Simple things that allowed me to start using the device immediately.  It took me longer to move the dresser and find a power outlet than it did to set up this device.  Very well done!",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"Worst product!! Don’t buy it!! Its been in use for only a day!! Not even a week!! Worked fine this morning and now I’m stuck on the white & orange “Firetv” logo screen. 3 dots are loading down, been trying that combo thing with the remote.Called customer service, thought that a big company like Amazon, would care about their customers, but no! They hang me and talked to 6 diferent persons, nobody knew how to help, and last was a M&@$8!? Who went on a champ speech saying that it was my fault for using it outside US! When there is nothing about it on their description!!",1,1,2019-10-9,1,1,1
"Very good compact device, that controls my Samsung TV and it’s sound bar seamlessly. Alexa input is very useful for controlling search for stuff within Amazon movie interface, and also works well with Alexa connected home automation devices, for instance Wifi light controls, and my security cams can now be displayed on TV with simple voice commands, and without need forany other Alexa devices. I’m really happy that I’m now back down to one remote, the Alexa remote for 95% of my streaming viewing activity! Works well in coordination with the Amazon Recast device, seamlessly integrated into the Fire TV visual interface, so no having to change video sources to watch OTA live or DVR’d network HD sources anymore too.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"I really like having control of all my favorite streaming programs all in one remote. I do appreciate the newest remote with volume, power on/off, mute and Alexa all in one. I believe i have had four of these the first one quit working after about a year but I upgraded. One in my RV, Bedroom and family room. I still have some buffering especially with news shows such as news on and others. Prime video works without problems so does Netflix and other apps I have. When we travel I use a a jetpack wifi from verizon in areas with no available free wifi and the firestick works fine. Easy to install and manage. If you have an extra HDMI port on your TV it's worth having.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"First, I have both Roku and Fire in my house , so I am familiar with both interfaces. Hands down I choose Roku over Fire. My biggest annoyance with Fire is that it constantly interrupts my viewing telling me my storage space is low and that I need to delete some of my apps. This never happens with Roku, on which I have three times as many apps installed as I do on my Fire. Even after I delete numerous apps (several of which I really wanted) I continue to get the error message. It’s like Fire offers you all these options then penalizes you for taking advantage of them. Roku on the other hand has so many more app options and no limits. The main reason I got both of these devices was for AppleTv because neither of my current smart tv’s support it.",3,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Loving the new features of this model. The most important upgrade hands down is the volume button!! Can I get a whoot whoot?! I can finally put the other remote away! It has a better voice recognition too. Pairs up really well with the echo show and it can even turn the TV on and open Netflix by voice command on the echo show! Greater pixels, faster load up, easy to install.. what’s not to love? Finally hands free! I can start, stop, and pause the shows. Nicely done Amazon. Nicely done. Maybe you can make one that makes a sandwich too? I hope this was super helpful!",5,1,2019-9-15,1,1,0
"We bought this specifically to stream Disney+, as our smart TV's native app offerings have not included it yet. The Fire Stick worked great for everything else, including Netflix, etc., and integrated with our TV well, doing things like controlling the master volume for our sound system. But despite multiple attempts to get Disney+ to work, it never would. We went with an equivalent Roku device instead, which works perfectly.",2,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
"I dislike Alexa. It's overrated. I don't need it! The operating system is very poorly developed. The main home screen launcher, KFTV Launcher, while displaying a very flashy home screen, eats up RAM. While you are searching for videos, and look at dozens of images of the actors in the videos, it will use up all available space in the device. The symptom is that you are prompted to uninstall your apps to free RAM. The KFTV Launcher may have up to 3 GB of RAM used. It conceals this by making it impossible for users to manage the app to view app size, data, and cache usage. The Amazon solution is a factory reset. That is unsatisfying, indicating poor app development.",1,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I love the Amazon Fire Stick so much that I have TWO of them !I have one Fire Stick at home connected to the TV in the guest bedroom with the SmartIPTV app loaded so that family visiting from other countries can watch TV in their native language.

"In my area, there are only 2 options for TV - satellite or cable, and I just don't want a dish on my property. The cable TV option is at least $50 a month (no idea what a dish runs) but there's no guarantee you're going to get all the channels you want anyway.  Get yourself a Prime Membership for 12.99/month, buy the Fire TV Stick for $50 and you'll have plenty of entertainment. I'm single, have no children living at home, and own one TV.  I've been watching plenty of movies - with no commercials - that are included in the Prime Membership, and I installed one of the free apps for other programming.  Eventually, I'll probably add a subscription service, but I don't need it yet.  As for news programming, turn on the radio and dial in to NPR for real reporting.  Cut the cable and save your money for better things, like books or a newspaper.  (P.S. I am pleasantly surprised to find that having Alexa [included and you don't need another gadget] is actually useful for more than finding shows and movies.)",5,1,2019-8-27,1,1,0
"This is my first Amazon streaming product, I bought this for the bedroom TV. The TV is only 1080p but I grabbed the 4K thinking it would provide a smoother experience that the standard stick. I'm very impressed, the interface is silky smooth and super responsive. My main TV has a Roku 4 on it, I would say the experience is similar, both products have their ups and downs. This turns the TV on and off and changes volume levels, big bonus and it took basically no effort to setup. After several hours of streaming it is completely cool to the touch. I was concerned because I've seen reddit pictures of people strapping heat sinks to it. I really have no complaints. The only way to improve it would be a remote finder feature like the Roku 4 has. I will buy a second one for my son's room when they go on sale again.",5,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"Was very disappointed to find out that Amazon was not going to work with our Sony DVD player anymore, and our only choice was to buy a new one or switch to fire stick, yet turned out they did us a great favor.  Picture quality has improved dramatically, and the speed and ease for searching and fast forwarding was better that we have had on all 3 of our tv's.  The addition of ALexa was a plus as well, something that we did not think we would use, and now use it regularly.  Also, we only use an antenna for TV viewing, and the amount of shows, and apps that are included with this is unbelievable.  So happy with it, we immediately bought two more for our other tv's.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"I can definitely tell a difference in the speed versus the generic Roku...It does take some getting used to because the layout is much different than the tile format of Roku.

"Moving on from having an Apple TV for years. The TV Stick is far superior at this point in so many ways. Not the least of which is the price. I am very loyal to Apple products overall, but the TV doesn't necessitate the price tag. Especially when the Fire TV is so reasonably prices and offers what I feel is a far superior user interface. For anyone other Apple purists, I don't think you'll lose points if you skip the Apple TV. The only thing I miss is the ease of Airplay from the Iphone to the Apple TV, but otherwise, nothing but an upgrade.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"I upgraded from the original Fire TV set top box. The remote is pretty good, but it should have better options for adding IR functionality. Alexa still falls short when making simple requests. The user interface is still too limited in customization. A much better processor and decoding capability than the original. Completely lacking non HDMI audio outputs. The Ethernet adapter should be included or integrated. USB ports would be appreciated for data storage and accessories (like a keyboard).",4,1,2019-8-1,1,1,0
"That's mainly because it is just faster.  Reboots in flash compared to my old Fire Box and even previous generation 4K dongle.  Navigating once loaded is fast too.

"I didn't watch a ton of Prime video before acquiring this device but now that I've been streaming Prime a bunch I have to say that the entire platform, or at least this device, is absolute garbage. Despite the fact that you're paying for ad free entertainment it forces you to watch an ad before every episode of content and after just a couple of episodes it will just stop and force you to have to manually tell it to continue streaming. It's a cheapskate, manipulative way to avoid giving a high quality experience just as you'd expect a thoroughly evil company like Amazon to pull.

Ok i love my 4K fire stick however there is couple of issues that could be enhanced by software integration. For example the fire stick integration with Alexa Dot or Echo is extremely primitive and hard. you can not fully control the 4K fire TV through Alexa dot or Echo which should not be the case and the integration recognition should be way way easier from a Usability point of view .Some apps glitch while working for example Sling Tv will glitch on you if you are watching live TV you might need to go  back 5 mints from live TV if you have DVR enabled to make sure there is not glitch.,5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0

There were apparently a couple of updates & he said that issue seemed to have cured itself for the most part. Now, however, he said the apps were not functioning correctly or at all. He's pretty good at tech research, but he's so frustrated at this point that when I asked him what he found on Google about this most recent issue, he said he didn't have the urge to even look anymore & was researching Apple TV  as a possible replacement.",2,1,2019-2-7,1,0,0

I even tried pairing it to at least half of the millions of TV manufacturers they have listed (including JVC which is listed) with absolutely no luck.  So it’s back to continuing to watch TV using 2 remotes:  Alternating between grabbing my TV remote for the power & volume (as it changes constantly) & grabbing the Fire Stick remote to control everything else. Rinse, repeat.  Total & complete let-down, Amazon.  I’m looking forward to the day when my new TV HOPEFULLY gets included in a software update. Ugh.  Why is this so difficult?!  👎🏻UPDATE:  Amazon quickly addressed the problem and my JVC TV was indeed included a few days later in a FireStick software update.

Does anyone not do this automatically now? No options beyond that. Decided to just send it back assuming this was a sign from the universe that I didn't need to watch more TV anyway.

My previous integrated platform was bulletproof; now, with this Fire TV stick on the same HDTV in the same location and same router, there are frequent stops/buffering when streaming.

The gen 1 stick is now so slow and it is  constantly buffering, I have no choice but to give it an upgrade to gen 4 just so that I can watch Netflix.One thing that it failed miserably over the generations/years is that when it goes into sleep mode, it doesn't cut off the video signal to the modern TV so that I'll turns itself off.  When the Fire TV Stick goes to sleep, it keeps the TV on with a black screen instead of cutting off the video signal.  This is unacceptable as we are all trying to save energy.  I would watch Fire TV every night while falling asleep just to wake up in the morning with my TV being still on with a black screen again and again.

I really like the Firestick tv 4k. The easiest setup ever (tv & Onkyo sound sytem). The one thing I would criticize is the interface with the YouTube TV app. The resolution is lacking (780) when going through the Firestick (not with other viewers) and the Alexa & Firestick search function only work for prime movies and a couple of other apps so you need to go into the YouTube TV app to search for shows by using their search engine.

I shouted with joy when I asked Alexa to get me one of my Audible books, thinking it was a long shot but BOOM! I was listening to a book on my TV, so AWESOME!!! Thank you Alexa!!!",5,1,2019-4-20,1,1,0
"Absolutely pointless piece of technology. No need for it considering any smart tv has the ability to add the apps you’d want to use. I got it hoping that there would be something “special” with it but, there’s absolutely nothing on it that I needed. Biggest waste of 40 bucks I’ve ever spent. Research what you would use it for and if you have a smart tv then you can get the apps this would provide. Absolutely ZERO point in getting this for myself. Just simply not anything “special” that I thought it might provide. If I could go back then I would and I wouldn’t get this. Very choppy streaming quality even with the Ethernet adapter. Oh well, lesson learned.",1,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0
"Bought this for the sole purpose of using with Disney + but have been surprised at all the other features. I was using my PlayStation to use Netflix, Hulu,etc... but this is much easier. Haven’t really dove into the voice control but it seems to work fine.It comes with an HDMI extender which I didn’t know so I ended up buying one when I bought this.  It’s handy if you don’t have room to have the stick sticking out of your tv so far.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"I have 4K TV set and was using a regular Fire TV Stick before this 4K Stick. I do not why , but the original Fire Stick display looks better than this new 4K Stick.Furthermore, I must say that I am very disappointed that this 4K Stick cannot sync with the original Stick, which means that you do not see any recently watched list or saved list by using the previous Stick.",3,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"I like this fire stick a lot.  The only problem is a few reviewers plus some of the people who answered my question about an adapter due to space issues said the adapter was 12"".  As the photo shows that isn't the case.  We got it up and running but I do have concerns about the tight fit and the wear on the adapter cord.  Setup was super easy, Alexa works great and we have an older TV with an awesome picture.My other problem is we were not notified in a timely manner.  The package was barely on the porch.  Packages have a habit of developing legs in our neighborhood...since we were at home waiting for the delivery,  a doorbell ring would have been greatly appreciated.",4,1,2019-8-11,1,1,1
I am a computer Tech for a logistics firm. I have plenty of computer knowledge. Don't waste your money or time on this. This thing gave me problems right from day one. I can only watch tv for about 30 seconds then it starts to buffer .  30 seconds tv then 5 minutes buffering. I should have believed all the revue's. Don't buy this unless you also subscribe to one of those expensive cable/satellite providers. But that defeats the purpose doesn't it? I even bought a new router for $ 157.00 THE FIRE STICK. still continues to buffer. The problem is with the fire stick NOT THE ROUTER. AMAZON DROPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE. I am going to send this back. I want my money back. $49.95 for the un unusable FIRE STICK and $157.00 for the new router I had to buy that comes to about  $206.00 That I wasted. I have been burned by AMAZON Before. But it wont happen again. In the future I will go some where else for my purchases. PS: MY OLD ROUTER WORKS GREAT I HAVE 3 OTHER DEVICES THEY ALL WORK FINE WITH IT. I  I AM NOT THAT STUPID.  UPDATE:  I HAVE HAD THIS THING FOR A WEEK IT STILL CONSTANTLY BUFFERS. IT IS STILL USLESS .,1,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"I love the Fire Stick! It’s so easy to use and so easy to program. I have an Atyme TV which is a 4K tv but it’s apparently a Samsung built off brand, or so I was told. It was so hard to find a programming code for my Bose remote, but with the Fire Stick they had a list of tvs in the on screen menu and I just scrolled down and found my tv, and it was automatically programmed. I also now use a Sony receiver for my audio, and the menu asked if I was using the TV for audio or a receiver. I clicked that I have a Sony receiver and it programmed itself instantly. I now only use the fire stick remote to turn on and off both the tv and receiver. No longer using two remotes helps a ton, and the selection of what you can watch is amazing! I haven’t turned on my PlayStation in weeks, This is so much easier!",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"I had one of the earlier versions of this stick.  We were streaming Disney+ and CBS All Access through this device along with tons of Amazon Prime content.  I thought it was just bad wifi setup on our part but anyway, I finally took the bait and upgraded to this new stick, taking advantage of the 50% discount offered by Amazon.Whoa!  Glad I did.  This new hardware clearly has improvements over my old one - noticeable download speed, faster response, better remote response and just better UI experience in tandem with the new hardware.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"For those with a 4k capable device (i.e. TV or projector) this is a great option to have.  My 4k projector recognizes the fire stick 4k just fine, and while I had to calibrate the projected display (for the image appears darker than desired) the overall output is nice and clean.  Have at least a 60Mbps connection with Xfinity to avoid severe buffering (cause it still happens, but less often compared to when at 50Mbps).  Interface is easy and while I can't program the volume and power buttons to my projector (only programs via Infrared and not other Bluetooth remotes) I was eventually able to program my LG soundbuds, which is such a convenient feature (one less remote to deal with, kinda).  Bought the sidekick attachment to program the other features of the sound at so I have one remote ""bundled"".  UI still the same as the older generations but with a bit more snap thanks to the upgraded processor and RAM.  For those with Prime and enjoy using Prime Video, along with other apps (anime fan as I am VRV works far better on this compared to Roku) this is a must.",5,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0
I had a older Firestick I was using to stream iptv and movies. It was struggling  with newer streaming apps and would over heat. I even put heatsinks on it to help with the cooling.Saw the special offer on the 4K and decided to go for it. First thing I noticed immediately it's physically larger than the original.

"Things were going really well with the Fire Stick until Amazon’s last update. It took up more space than any other, therefore forcing me to delete apps i had for a year.  The update froze the stick, never completed, and prevented me from logging into my tv provider, which is required for some of the apps. I spoke with customer service who told me that there’s nothing they can do and offered me 15% discount on a replacement. That’s it. To review: their update broke my Fire Stick and they offered 7 bucks off a replacement. Give me a break...",1,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
"i have used all sorts of different devices hooked to my older flat screen (2009) to stream TV from the net and while they all worked as they should I was never happy with the picture quality... then I saw this one on Amazon on sale and thought, Hmmm maybe it would be better...? My TV is only a 720P so while the picture is good its not ""High Def"" by any stretch of the imagination, but when i hooked this up and turned the TV on to a show on Amazon Prime I was blown away! It actually makes my TV a lot more clearer, cleaner with a lot more detail than ever... it blows away DVDs and Blue rays... Now it could be my imagination considering the last streaming device I was using was my Blue Ray player which made watching Amazon prime like looking at TV thru a foggy lens..lol  I cannot recommend this 4K Fire Stick enough! I am very happy with it.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"We switched from cable and it saved a ton of money. Prior to cable we had Roku and constantly had issues with voice and video staying in sync. This isn’t the case with Firestick. We use Hulu for live local TV and Amazon Prime TV for many of their original series. I highly recommend cutting the cable.One thing to note: for the more expensive stick you need to 4K or higher TV. If your smart TV is older, get the less expensive stick. It works fine.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,1,0
"I have had every streaming device known to man. Even custom boxes built to install custom software, however hands down the firestick is the best entertainment software on the market.

The menus are easy to navigate and with a plethora of addons you will never be short on movies, TV shows, or music.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
We learned through on line research that we could power the fire stick without needing a power outlet.  Simply using the TV USB port as the power source and then plugging into the HDMI port allowed for an extremely easy set up without needing to add additional wires.  The fire stick was an easy way for us to be able to upgrade a smart TV to watch newer apps that were not supported by a 2014 Samsung Smart TV.  We only wish the voice recognition feature worked for all local cable channels and programs as a true replacement remote,4,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
"Fires TV Stick works well with TV's to reduce the need for a cable connection for TV service.  You still need internet access, and it needs to be fast enough to support the streaming you may decide to do.  Before switching, try to determine which streaming services you actually need, as most of them have a charge of some sort, and you may find with all the specialized channels you desire, it may be cheaper to stay with the cable.  Just a note of information.  Smart TV's usually have access to Bluetooth technology to support internet streaming.  Read your manual to determine what sites you can actually connect to.  You may have to load an app for some channels (Not built into the TV).  Again, do your research first.",4,1,2019-4-8,1,0,0
Amazon...I just want to thank you!  Alexa is a no brainer. Always loved her a bit more than google assistant. But I was always hung up on Roku so I never gave fire tv a shot...until now!

"I am very pleased with the Fire TV Stick. It was very easy to set up and it is super fast. We recently transitioned to fiber optics at home and will be dropping cable connection. All of our TVs were smart TVs except for one and the Fire TV Stick was the perfect solution to allow streaming to that particular TV. Now we can access our favorite content and stream to all of our TVs without the cables, cable boxes, and outrageous cable fees!! I have streamed using Apple TV and Raspberry Pi however the Fire TV Stick seems to be the fastest while also including more user-friendly features. The voice control with Alexa is very handy as well!",5,1,2019-4-27,1,1,0
"I have enjoyed the Fire Stick so far.  It was very easy to set up.  I have enjoyed some movies and still exploring other things to view.  The problems I have had are: 1) sometimes the sound goes off during a movie--no idea why; restarting seems to help 2) it is difficult to know when the Fire Stick is turned off.  I try to turn it off when I'm not using it to save batteries, but then when I try to use it, the TV gets confused because there is nothing to detect on the HDMI, even if I press the power button.  3) sometimes, the Fire Stick turns off our sound bar--unknown reason. 4) It is difficult to know when I have to pay for a show or movie--not very clear.",4,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"Not impressed with this at all. Got it on sale for prime day, and first of all, Alexa voice doesn’t even do anything, but that’s not the real problem! it’s been giving me trouble connecting to my WiFi.. sometimes my server doesn’t come up at all and sometimes it says it’s not in range when my router is literally right by my tv where the fire stick is plugged into. If it even does show up under network, it’ll say it’s connected, but when I go to the home page, it’s says I’m not connected to a network. This was a total waste of money. I’ve only been able to watch tv on it maybe 4 times in the 4 months I’ve had it! It’s fixing to go in the trash.",1,1,2019-11-14,1,1,0

"I wanted/needed a new 4K streaming box, after moving my 4K (2nd Gen) FireTV box to my main tv.  The hidden gem of the new 4K stick is the remote.  This is running my rig in the living room, including: an LG 4K tv, Sonos Beam, 2 Sonos Ones, and calling my Plex/NAS server.  Inherently, this made my living room infinitely nicer than my big setup with my 2nd Generation 4K FireTV box.  Please note: if you have a bunch of inputs running through an AV box (like I do), you'll need an HDMI extender (because the stick is juuuuuust a bit too wide). All I ask is for a new FireTV box...with this remote hotness.  I want to ONLY run my fireTV on my big rig downstairs.  The ability to turn my TV on/off + run my Sonos speaker volume through it is everything.  One remote for the wife.  Happy Happy.  For me: PLEASE PUT A 1G PORT ON IT.  Or give me an option for 1G throughput.  :)",4,1,2019-1-15,1,1,0
This is very impressive  it set up quickly and easily. It has a browser built in so it can connect through captured portals (hotels that require a log in ). That's a big deal lots of other streamers can't do this  It searches for requests you make across all the streaming services you set up. There are some amazon prime video adds but not a lot and they happen before a selection starts. Thus was another solid delivery of service and hardware from amazon,5,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
"I love the Amazon Fire Stick! When there is nothing on TV that I want to watch I just change the input to the Firestick and I can watch Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Video.

Also, when we go on vacation, I take the stick with me and I can watch what I want no matter what channels are on TV in the vacation condo. I have two of them and I am giving some for Christmas!

"I got this to go in our bedroom. Despite the TV not being 4k (It eventually will be) the price difference between the standard model and 4k model was small enough for me to go for the 4K version.I have an Nvidia shield in our living room and honestly, if you're not wanting to stream ultra HD from your plex server or play video files from external storage, the fire stick is great.  It's nice to be able to plug a USB drive loaded with movies into my Shield TV and play but that thing cost quite a bit more than this and the fire stick is practically non-existent being tucked back behind the TV.",5,1,2019-2-8,1,0,0

The device came out of the loop on its own after about 40 h (yes, long!) with my TV on. After that I was able to delete those problem apps. All OK now. Snappy response for channel surface. Faster than satellite or cable TV boxes during channel change.Drawback: I cannot speak to the remote to set a reminder. I still have to use Echo dot.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"Do not buy this thing if you have Directv. AT &T has made it impossible to pair with their box and do not plan on allowing amazon products to work with their systems. They are afraid that some microscopic percentage of users might use the Fire TV Stick4D to find a way to use two tv's without paying for a genie. Every time I have used a service provided by AT &T it was a constant battle of misrepresentations, pricing problems and outright misleading ads and info from customer service. I had Directv before AT & T bought them out so i am stuck with them until I can find another way. DISH TV allows the use of Fire TV Stick 4K and have an app to do it with.

Customer service had me on hold for over 52 minutes. We tried to troubleshoot the device in many ways and it did not work which is okay. Why didn't they just send me another stick? I felt like I was being placed on trial. I am sending the stick back to amazon and i have to wait 3-5 days to get a refund on the stick so I can purchase a new one. They should have sent me a new stick same day or next day and then wait to receive the stick. They could have charged me if I didn't return the old stick within 7 days.

"So I bought this Fire TV Stick back in 3/19, and it already started to malfunction. So I did all the troubleshooting, even putting in fresh Duracell batteries. So I decided since it is still under warranty to give Amazon a call and get a replacement. After going in circles with the rep about when it was purchased and if it was still under warranty and for how long, finally he tells me that I have to wait because what sounded like to me that I was in between warranties and now I have to wait till the other one kicks in.

Definitely the picture quality upgraded also much faster then the old firestick. I've also added a HDMI 3ft extension 4k compatible cord. Now its away from the back and in front of my TV which means. Less heat no TV interference with the better wifi connection. If your going to spend the money on this 4k firestick do this set up. Your already saving money not having cable so why not get something worth your money.,5,1,2019-3-16,1,2,0
"This was very disappointing.  1. Closed captioning not available, ask Alexa to turn on closed captioning,  she says ""I can't do that with fire tv"".  2. I already had subscriptions to some paid channels (eg. Britbox), but the only way to load the app with the fire stick is if you pay Amazon for the subscription, even if you already have a subscription.  3. The picture is very dark.Compared to the 4K Roku,  there is no comparison.

Apple customer support pointed the blame towards my cable provider. I told them that my Roku and Amazon (integrated TV/Insignia) devices didn't require credential verifications at this extremity. Either way, the problem has never been resolved. Enter this sweet new 4K Fire device to replace an Apple TV. The UI is so much more user friendly, and accessibility of switching between apps is swift.

What a complete waste of time and effort.  Not to mention if your interested in other channels be prepared to shell out $4.99 and up for each channel.  I honestly can not see what I saved or how I benefited with purchasing this Firestik?

"I bought this device to stream Amazon Prime Video through a new TCL 6-series Roku TV and I could never get it to connect to the TV through the TV's HDMI connector.  When I first connected the stick to one of the HDMI ports and powered on the stick, I could get to the first Fire TV screen but then it disappeared.  Despite recycling power on the stick three times, the TV kept saying there was no signal (from the stick).  Thinking that maybe the stick wouldn't provide the required signal to the TV until the stick was set up properly, I took it to an Insignia TV I have and connected it to that TV's HDMI connector.  This time I could see the stick and connect it to my WiFi network and download updates.  However, when I went to sign into my Prime account, the stick just ""disappeared"" from the TV's HDMI connector three times.  The fourth time I recycled power on the stick the TV recognized it but made me sign into my WiFi network again.  This time I was able to sign into my Prime account and everything seemed OK.  So I took the stick back to my TCL TV and the TV appeared to see the newly-configured Fire TV stick but after one minute it said that the remote needed to be updated and to not touch anything for a couple of minutes.  So while the remote was updating,  my entire TV screen turned orange.  After waiting for the update to finish for about four minutes, I changed the TV back to the HDMI input that was connected to my cable box to watch TV while the update finished.  However, after waiting 20 minutes and then going back to the stick's HDMI input, I could no longer see the stick.  I recycled power on the stick but it still wasn't being detected on the HDMI input.  Finally, I just gave up and I'll be sending the stick back tomorrow.Besides the stick not working, the other really bad thing about this Fire TV Stick is the remote.  I've never seen a TV remote that had a back cover that was so difficult to remove!  I struggled with it for over fifteen minutes until I finally managed to get it off.  It's so difficult to remote that people have posted videos on YouTube showing how to get the darned thing off!",1,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0

There isn’t enough nor is there a slot to add a micro SD as I had with the Fire TV.  While trying to load a game app, I was informed I did not have enough storage!  Therefore, I had to uninstall over 9 or more apps and clear caches.  Very disappointing!!!!

"Just like many others, I wanted to cut the cord with cable.  After a very frustrating call with Cox, I made the rash decision to cancel cable and quickly went to the internet to find a replacement. Enter Firestick. It arrived quickly, setup was incredibly easy, and voila... I'm back in business! That was short lived. It lost connection frequently. I tested everything - my modem is fine, my internet speeds are good, my wireless router is fine, my wifi signal is strong, and yet at least once per hour, it freezes and I have to restart the Firestick. I now have major regrets and have to prove to my family that this was a good move (they're not happy that I cancelled cable). I took to the internet to troubleshoot and found that this is a rather common occurrence - more regrets for not doing my research.  Eventually, I moved my modem and router from another room to next to the TV (this seemed futile because my wifi signal strength was excellent already).  This seems to have done the trick. We now experience the freeze once every few days as opposed to multiple times per day - still frustrating, but far better. 3 stars because it (mostly) works, it's easy to set up and even with multiple subscriptions (Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Stars and HBO), I'm saving money over cable. However, Amazon needs to figure out the connection issues in order to make the Firestick a really great product.",3,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0

Plus I have access to FREE stuff like ID Go that gives me the same police procedurals I end up watching on regular tv anyway. If you have Amazon Prime it becomes ever more of a no-brainer with Prime Video and Netflix both completely supported. My internet connection isn't the fastest (literally, it's the middle speed of 3) and the stick has to pick up the signal on WiFi two floors away. But it is incredibly fast, responsive and the picture is gorgeous. If have a non-smart TV do the smart thing and upgrade if for under 40 bucks!

I contacted customer service to request a refund for that difference and they adamantly said they would not do that.  I pressed them quite hard, but they stood their ground, citing company policy.

I received my fire stick and was able to set it up easily. We have Spectrum internet with a 10$ package to use the fire stick for all network TV shows. We mainly watch a lot of ABC for news and talk shows. After a month the live vides player started giving us trouble to I called Spectrum. They said it was the stick. I called Amazon and they walked me through a reset and it didn't correct the live video. They then gave me a number to call ABC. That call never went to anyone so I have  fire stick that I bought primarily to watch ABC live and I can not do it. No one accepts responsibility. I do not recommend if my situation is anything like yours.,3,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"The first two units I received worked for a few hours before dying (no longer providing a signal to the TV).  Getting them replaced was a bit of a hassle. Both times the person who assisted me insisted that I repeat troubleshooting steps that I had already performed and informed them of at the beginning of our interactions. I was also suffering from a respiratory infection and did not want to needlessly duplicate my efforts.This third unit has been working fine for almost a month now. All units were easy to connect and set up and worked great until they stopped working at all. If it wasn't for the first two defective units and the somewhat annoying exchange process, this would have been a 5 star review.",3,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
The viewing quality is excellent.  Alexa works great but Amazon keeps tab on all your business.  The one thing that annoys me is how many programs that charge you to watch.  Even worse the advertising every 5-10 minutes before the end of the program or movie.  Makes you want to scream.  There is a lot of content available but at what price?  You must choose wisely or you will be paying as much as Dish Network or Direct TV.,4,1,2019-8-1,1,1,0
"UPDATED REVIEW: The first Fire TV Stick 4K I received was  terrible and I wrote a review stating that. Before I could even contact Amazon about a return or replacement I got a phone call from an Amazon rep wanting to know about my review (yes, they must actually read these reviews!)  Anyway, she shipped a new stick out and sent me a return slip for the bad one. The new one came and has been working flawlessly. I also have to say I like the upgraded remote as it now has mute and volume control included.  So I am now a pretty happy customer.  PREVIOUS REVIEW: I've been using a Fire TV - 1st Generation since 2014 and have only had minor problems with it. It's been just a bit glitchy lately so I thought I'd upgrade to the Fire Tv Stick 4K. What a bad decision! I couldn't get ANY Prime Video offerings to play - it didn't matter whether it was a show/movie included in Prime or a movie I had purchased. Strangely it plays Netflix just fine and Hulu most of the time. But it hasn't played any Amazon video offerings even one single time. For Amazon shows it just spins as if buffering and then  - SOMETIMES - comes back and says my internet it too slow (other times it just continues to spin/buffer forever). An installed Speed Test app (installed on my home page and running through the Fire Stick), however, works just fine and says download speed is  always 80-95 Mbps. Very curious. I got very frustrated, naturally. So I removed the Firestick 4K and reinstalled my 1st generation Fire TV and, wonder of wonders, everything played just fine. And to forestall the question - no, it didn't matter if it was running through wi-fi or hardwired. I'll probably see if Amazon will replace it with a new Fire Stick 4K on the off-chance that this is just a freak stick, but after reading some of the other reviews I'm not holding my breath. If I do get a replacement product and it works I will revise my review - but right now I just have to say - RUN FAST, RUN FAR, to some competitor's product!",5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
"My friend installed the fire sticks on 2 TVs and made navigating everything look easy. Being of a ""certain age"" I do not understand the who streaming - app driven technology. So the difficulty in finding this is mine. The remote is super east and for a senior a perfect size for my hand and the printing is large enough to see. I have discovered YouTube. I cannot find the regular programming but as mentioned - operator error. I will learn or not but the reception is awesome.",5,1,2019-8-19,1,1,0

"So when i first got this product, i thought it was defect or something because every-time when i play a new video on my tv, it stoped at 4-5 seconds and I was about to return it. Was low key mad and frustrated. Until I asked one of my friend who has one too and they told me to try updating the software of the 4k fire tv stick and I tried that then it fixed the issue. Now Ive been using it everyday to stream disney+ on ultraHD quality. Love it so much! Used it during the holiday to stream some old and new movies with the family. Love the Alexa option too so I can use it with my Echo devices. Hope this product last forever!But if you guys are getting it for the first time please dont forget to update the software, the product is not broken or defective like i thought!",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"This sounded like a good idea but I was still invisioning a TV screen that was recognizable and the word ‘firestick meant nothing to me. More importantly, my husband, who suffers from dementia, is the one who uses the TV. I do not. People with dementia are no longer in a learning phase. They are losing memory and do not learn new things. My husband went into panic mode and a serious situation arose. We never used the firestick but went back to cable which he, as yet, understands. My fault for not realizing how certainly we have outlived our understanding of digital technology. Firestick is not for those who are still in electrical analog technology.",1,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"I can no longer recommend fire tv as an option.  The ads have gotten so invasive it’s challenging to browse for content.  The recent update dims the screen and shows an Alexa tip every few seconds, unacceptable.  Really enjoyed the simplicity and recast integration but AppleTV doesn’t annoy me like the Amazon product does.  Save the money and look elsewhere...UPDATE 5/11: The Alexa tips have gone away on the home screen making the experience much better.  Not sure if it was due to a software update or resetting the device but now the tips only appear on the screen saver.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,1,0
"The Firestick 4k replaced a Sony Media Player which was no longer being supported (Thanks NETFLIX) on 10 yr old 1080p Samsung TV.  However to my great pleasure, the picture quality from the 4k stick was vastly improved and the streaming perfect with no breaks or pixellation and so far no outages.  Set up was easy - basically plug & play - although there was insufficient power to use the USB power option, so I had to run a cable for the power adapter (no biggie).  The voice recognition is great - I have it set to English (UK) for use in the USA - although I tend to browse with the remote.Only downside, which I expected, is that the menus are Amazon service and pay per view prioritized.  If you have a cable subscription, like Spectrum, and spend a little time setting up the channels, you can watch the subscription channels through the firestick which I found had better picture and streaming quality than the supplied cable box.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
I love this! Great picture and saved me from having to buy another tv. Super easy to set up even for a novice. I used the hdmi extension to get it away from the tv a few more inches. PLENTY OF FREE apps that require no subscription and no sign in.Several of the free apps have a better selection of channels than every major cable tv providers basic channel package and most are uncut although they may have some commercial breaks. With every penny for cord cutters. I will say it works best with Amazon Prime but it's not necessary. Can be moved from one tv to another as long as it has an hdmi port. If you router is close to your tv you can get the adapter for a cat 6 cable and connect straight to your router for a much faster and more reliable stream.,5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"The Fire TV 4k is a good device when it works properly. Unfortunately it needs to be reset very frequently. I find that it is the only device in my home that does not get along well with Hulu, and some of the time YouTube is troublesome for it. This product is kind of a disappointment considering that, and the fact thatvit does not come with a long enough cable to avoid interference from other electronics. I had to purchase a 3' cable to get it away from the TV. This device also has internet connection issues constantly. My network is strong enough that I can still use it with my phone from 4 blocks away, and it very rarely drops out. When all the other devices appear to have strong connection, this device says ""Fair"" or ""Marginal"". This occurs even when I disconnect all other devices from my network. Maybe I got a lemon, or so I thought. Turns out my friends and a couple other reviewers have the same issues.",3,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
"Just received the fire stick 4k 3 days ago. I wall looking for something that i could stream music under 1 platform. This allowes me to do that. I can stream music on amazon music, pandora and spotify on this device connected to my tv and than audio out to my integraded amplifier and bookshelf speakers using optical cable. Sounds great and no need to buy network media player which cost couple hundred dollars. I can airplay music and videos as well but application costs about $5. I downloaded pluto tv app which has free tv channels. Voice activated remote is great using alexa i can look for specific videos on youtube by giving comands. Over all I am very happy with the purchase and I ordered second stick for my bedroom. Hope the product lasts and if it starts acting up i will update the review.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
"My biggest issue with this product is not the product itself. The product works fine and I have no problem with that whatsoever. My issue is that Amazon offered a rebate off of a fire stick for each of my Sony TVs that they stopped providing support on the Prime app within the Sony interface. However, after buying two fire sticks for my two Sony TVs, they told me that the rebate was really only one per account (and not one for each TV). By then it was too late to return so i had to eat the difference. Still like the product, amazon just needs to work on their marketing and being up front.",1,1,2019-9-5,1,2,0
"Very easy to install. The remote works great! Especially glad to be able to adjust the volume from the Firestick remote.It's important to educate yourself about streaming devices before purchasing so you know what you will actually get. The Firestick did enable me to discontinue having cable, but I have subscriptions (such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.) to several apps which provide me with what I want out of TV viewing. The Firestick just enables me to watch what I want through those apps that I subscribe to instead of paying for cable. Once the Firestick is installed, many apps will display on your screen; however, seeing an app listed does not mean you have a subscription to it. For example, if you choose the Netflix app on your screen, and you do not have a subscription to Netflix, you will need to create an account, including paying for a subcription to access the the shows offered through that app. Additionally, if you do not have a Smart TV, a streaming device like the Firestick will enable your TV to act like a Smart TV, as long as you have a USB port on your TV.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0

Does not hang, does not have odd ball navigation, etc. Also, accessibility for blind user is important in our house and they have done a better job on this than even the Apple. Go figure.

It has an excellent remote, it comes on, shows a screen which is easy to navigate and quickly responds. While watching a tv show or movie on this, it is so good I forgot it was streaming. Wow.

And why, oh why, does amazon refuse to let anyone organize their video purchases in any  way? I can organize my books, at least in collections. NOTHING for videos. Annoying. So far, at least 33% of the time I can only access 10 to 20 of my prime videos. Otherwise the stick is decent.",3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"The device is okay and it works relatively well.  However, it doesnt show you the cheapest provider to rent movies from up front like other devices do. Unfortunately, one has to dig deep into its menues to find alternative rental options.  I understand from a business perspective of wanting to rent the same movies for more to ones customers, but Amazon could afford to be more competitive and at least show all the best prices up front and even match their top competitors prices if they wanted to.  The only reason why I purchased this is because I wanted to try a Fire ReCast DVR and Amazon wont provide an app for Recast to use on a smart televisions or other streaming device.  This seems really petty that such a big company is forcing their customers into buying extra relatively inexpensive devices just to make a few more bucks.  The extra few buck is one thing, but having to set up more equipment and having limited HDMI ports will become problematic for most.  Well I guess now I got another remote to deal with just so I can stream my local over the air shows to my TVs via wifi.  The Recast device is by far the best, but having to buy extra adapters for each television you own is a huge disappointment and oversight on Amazon's part as it will push a lot of customers towards the other great over the air tv boxes that use apps instead.",1,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"We ordered this as new ""cable cutters"" looking for the best fit for us.  As Prime members we waited over a week (woop! woop!) which really makes no sense.  As a Prime member, purchasing an Amazon product, waiting longer than 2 days (should really only be 1!) is a rip off.  So it finally arrived.  Works as described.  Does the job nicely.  And guess what?!?  Now that it finally arrived, it's on sale and Amazon has no price guarantee-type policy.  Go figure.  Used to LOVE Amazon.  I've been a loyal customer for a long time, even before it was household name.  It's gotten worse over time.  Not just because of this ""COVID-19"" excuse, even before that.

"I am not a ""techie"" by any means, remember that when you read what I'm about to relate.  I bought a third Fire TV Stick for my Sharp TV because I was so pleased with the other two that were installed in my Samsung TVs, but after a day it stopped working.  I was about to return it thinking it was defective when I decided to switch it for another one already installed in my other Samsung TV.  When I installed the one I knew had been working fine on the Samsung to the Sharp TV for which I had bought the third one, it didn't work on that TV, but it did on the other 2 Samsung.  Long story short, all the Fire TV sticks I've bought worked as expected if connected to my Samsung TVs, but all failed to work on either of the 2 Sharps Aquos I own.  For those 2 I went to Best Buy and got 2 Roku and they work fine, so I know it wasn't dead USB connections on the Sharps.

No blaring music or channel noise while you look for shows; nice relaxing quiet; what a relief. Adding a bunch of apps for various networks we watch regularly was a bit tedious, but well worth it. Seperately from this purchase we signed up for Directv Now streaming live TV service and have FINALLY been able to cut the cord, saving us well OVER $100 a month in cable fees.

It's faster, has a clearer connection, the search function is the best of any streaming device, & it does anything an Echo device does (the ONLY exception- it can't set alarms or timers).

Nice seeing Prime Video on something other than iPad.  Lucky for me I had a 1080P TV tucked away because it would not work on my 720P.  Easy install and setup once the TV was figured out.

This newest-generation technology in the 4K Fire stick and voice remote is fantastic. Very easy to set up. Very quick to tune to your favorite shows and movies. The only complaint I have is the same one I had with the Echo... you have to learn how to say the commands so ""she"" understands. So, there's a small learning curve, which is a minor annoyance, but not a negative. I use this product for Amazon Prime video options and Hulu+.

The remote works great with my 4K TV and my 4K receiver. I recommend Fire Stick all the time to people seeking to cut the cable or satellite albatrosses. Very pleased once again by Amazon.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I have three smart TVs, but Amazon Prime isn't easily manipulated with the TVs' remotes.  The Fire Stick and its remote work perfectly.  One TV is a bit far from my router so I added an ethernet adapter to the Fire Stick for about $12.Another issue with an LG TV is I could not get the ARC function to work properly to send audio back to a Denon AVR.  I just plugged the Fire Stick into the HDMI Aux port on the AVR and it worked perfectly.  People I talked to at Amazon claimed this wouldn't work but it does.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,0,0
"I primarily bought this for DirecTV Now. This is my first Fire Stick, but have Rokus as well as Apple TV. This device actually manages to keep up with the ATV(actually in some cases DTVN runs better on the Fire Stick) and the remote is way better.The only thing that I needed to change was the HDR setting from Always to Adaptive. DirecTV Now doesn't support HDR yet and trying to force HDR made the colors flat and very off. After switching to adaptive the picture was great.",5,1,2018-11-9,1,2,0
"I didnt realize that it was missing a remote until months later because we purchased two of them. One for home and one to take with us on trips to use in hotels. We dont have tv at home so we like to continue watching the same shows when we are away. The one we used at home we  hooked up immediately, the other we stored away in the closet until about 5 months later and when we opened it we realized it was missing a remote. I didnt report it to amazon because I figured they would no way believe that I purchased it at Christmas last year and just last month realized it didnt have the remote. It cost almost as much as a new one to replace the remote so instead we just downloaded the fire tv app on our phones. My advice just make sure all the pieces are there as soon as you get it.",5,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"I really liked this Fire TV Stick 4K until I upgraded my setup to take full advantage of Dolby Atmos.  Unfortunately it was a no go, and lots of forums and users are complaining about the same.  Despite having a fully capable Dolby Atmos setup, the option isn't available to select for Dolby Atmos, even when clicking on the ""hamburger"" button for audio settings when playing UHD content.  My search for an answer to this came up with many many others reporting the same issue.  The solution is to switch to a competing streaming device.  I'm sure it technically ""supports"" it but it's just not there.  Time to move on to something else I guess.",3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I had a Chromecast (gave it away), still have a Roku, and now this device. I have also have a Sony TV which as Android TV built in, and for some reason using the fire device is turning on my TV after I have shut it down for the night. Looking for setting so far have not found the issue. Other problems YouTube app not available, it uses a browser to do a workaround which works ok most of the time. Remote too small for my average man hands for something you use often. I hate the layout, it is Prime centric. It's a fine toy, but not as complete or as well designed as the Roku. My ranking, Roku(1), Android TV(2),Fire(3), Chromecast(4). Will likely just keep this around for guest bedroom.The only plus over a Roku is the Dish Anywhere app which is great for a guest bedroom. Glad it was cheap, now I know why.",3,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
"A friend had suggested the Fire TV Stick awhile back and at first I asked myself why would I want another generic online streaming device. No it has become my first go to option for online streaming, replacing the Roku and Xbox and computer. Most if not all the streaming services are available and with the integration of Alexa, you simply ask what you want to do and it’s done. The great thing about the Fire TV Stick, is the portability and tiny footprint (what footprint?). As long as your final destination has a decent wifi and a HDMI port, you’re good to go. Since Fire TV is build on the Android interface, the open source possibilities are almost endless.",4,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
"Product has great potential but needs tweaks to be all it should be.  A case of amazon policies getting in the way of something great.  Huge problem to me that Vudu isn’t available.  I have some owned movies that don’t show up in any other digital lockers.  The fight with Disney over Disney + not being available is a deal breaker.  There are also entirely too many ads in the interface.  feels absolutely inundating and I would pay more for an ad reduced experience. Also the interface needs to be simpler. Roku is drop dead easy but fire tv requires a ton of clicks.  Would REALLY like google play music to be an app since all my owned music is in their digital locker.  If Prime had this same perk I’d be more happy.With all that said, I just bought a Roku stick to replace this since Roku will have Disney + at launch.  I’m happy to spend more on the Roku since it is more neutral and doesn’t carry any of the criticism that I have on Fire tv stick.  Typically I really like amazon and this is a great piece of hardware but the negatives far outweigh the positives.",3,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
I was looking for a streaming device that could easily convert my smart LG tv a bit more smarter ;).Was thinking of several other devices but then finally narrowed down on 4K fire stick.,5,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
"It's much faster than the LG WebOS 3.5 that came with my LG 55UJ6200. But, the YouTube experience is mediocre, since it's not a proper app, but just a link to YouTube.

"We upgraded from a slightly older Roku stick, and this Fire TV Stick is SO much faster and has a much more crisp picture! I used to wait at least a full minute to boot up the Roku, a Hulu/Netflix app, and start playing a show. The Fire TV Stick is fast enough that I can have a show playing in seconds. It integrates really well with Hulu and Netflix (better than Roku in my opinion). Setup was a breeze, it came pre-loaded with my account so I didn't even have to log in to Amazon! Plus, the remote can control my TV's volume (which is good because my dog destroyed the other remote). I have not used the Alexa feature much and I find it a bit awkward because you have to hold the microphone button the whole time to use Alexa.",5,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"I originally left a bad review when I first bought and installed my 4K fire stick. I couldn’t get the Disney+ app to work. There was no sound, and the picture would freeze after about 10 seconds on Disney+. After taking off the HDMI extender it seemed to work better, and I haven’t had any problems. In fact it worked so good, I bought another one for my living room.Now the reason for only giving 2 stars. After installing another 4K fire stick on my living room TV, any time I watch something it keeps buffering every 10 minutes or so. Doesn’t make sense because it’s literally 3 feet away from the modem. I could understand having this problem in another room, but with the modem being only 3 feet way? My laptop, phone, ps4, etc. don’t have this problem.",2,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
I've had a Roku and an Apple TV for a couple of years now. I recently cut the cable cord and needed another streaming device and decided to go with the Fire Stick based on a friend's recommendation. This thing beats both my other streamers by a mile. Load times are much faster than the Roku and the stream quality is better (for some reason the Roku wouldn't even detect the 5G network and had pretty poor live streaming). I switched to YoutubeTV which had problems on the and the Roku glitch where episodes on Hulu start at the end doesn't exist with the Firestick. I liked it so much I went back and bought another a couple weeks later so I could retire my Roku (I hate the Apple TV because the control is so janky but my wife likes it so we'll probably compromise and keep it forever),5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"Overall it works well.  If you have any network you have to reboot it.  It doesn't reconnect well if you have to reboot your router, then you have to reboot the fire stick.  Shouldn't need to do that, but that appears common on Amazon Fire and Echos devices.I have 5 of these, my last one has a problem with the battery cover coming off all of the time.  The others don't have this problem.  So watch out for that.",3,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"The video quality and voice search are excellent.We gave a lag sometimes between video and audio of about a second, which is very annoying. We found that if we pull the power from the device, wait about 15 seconds or so, and then reconnect, that this problem resolves.",3,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0

Setup and activation was a snap.  Once activated it took only a short times to figure out how to run it (Directions?  We don't need no stinking directions.).  We are enjoying far better pictures than we ever had with cable as well as being able to find TV shows and movies to watch when we want to watch them.Can't speak to voice recognition or Alexa as we don't use either.,5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I was happy to get to see television without purchasing the cable.  I had trouble installing the Fire TV, but I stayed calm which made me think.  I got it set up and found using the remote was a not as easy but after a week I was a pro at using the remote.  I had Netflix and Hulu connected on it.  Everything was fine except when I watched sports on Hulu and had problems.  I had to solve the problem and the answer is that you have to have a certain level of internet service coming in your home.  I upped my internet service and it was better.  Hulu still gives me trouble of freezing screens and have to reboot my internet service about once a month.",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"Fire Stick 4K works several times faster than the 2 year old device I have (sorry not sure which is the generation of the old one). But I am unable to use it as in the moment I plug it in, Optoma 142x will not start by any remote. I tried fully disabling the remote functionalities (including volume buttons are disabled), tried several google/amazon forums suggestions, all to no avail. As the projector is mounted on a high ceiling it is not an option for me to continue using the 4K Fire Stick and using a pole to start Optoma.

Next I like the endless choices of series and movies I have to choose from which to pick. And last but not least the ease of use, I have just begun to scratch the surface of all that allows me to do.

"I replaced a 2nd generation Fire TV with the 4K Stick and wow, what a difference.  The older Fire TV had gotten glitchy and required frequent reboots.  It was connected to my network via the ethernet port which made for a stable connection so I was leery of switching to the 4K Stick but my concerns were unfounded,  Everything about my viewing experience is improved as a result of the switch.  The response time is much faster over the wireless network than what I was getting from the wired ethernet connection.  Response time when navigating is nearly instantaneous and downloading content is noticeably faster,  As an added bonus, I was able to reduce my remotes down to one as the 4K Stick's controller seamlessly integrated with my Samsung TV and sounder so now I use one controller to do everything.  I am extremely satisfied with my decision to swap out the older Fire TV with this 4K Stick,",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"I’ll start off by saying, THAT I WOULD NEVER GO TO STREAMING !!!! That being said, my wife bought me the fire stick 4K, with voice control remote (Alexa), after telling her a few thousand times to send it back, I broke down & opened it up, looked at it for what seemed like an hour ( probably 5 minutes, if that) I decided to hook it up (very easy to install), then I started playing with it and guess what, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT !!!!! The 4K fire stick is everything Amazon says it is. The picture on just about everything I’ve went into is nothing short of AWESOME !!!!! The shows & movies that you can watch on this is amazing, I’ve had not one problem with the stick, no buffering, nothing. And hooking it up, forget about it, easy as 1,2,3.

"The Firestick is easy to use, easy to learn and provides so many options that it's impossible to use them all. Apps are available for everything from finding your lost cell phone to yoga. I've been using it for about 3  months and am still finding new uses every day. The voice recognition is great. I have an accent that it initially had a hard time interpreting but over time with use it has learned to recognize and understand what I'm saying. The streaming quality is fantastic on my 4K TV. When I first got the Firestick 4K, I had streaming and cable both for about a month. I was able to compare the image of regular cable to the streaming image and was amazed how much better streaming was. There is nothing about the Firestick 4K that disappoints!",5,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

"I got this before I realized that my new LG TV had the Amazon Prime app, but I am glad I did because it works perfectly to deliver the 4K content whereas the Amazon Prime app on the LG TV says my internet is too slow to deliver 4K!!  My speed is well over 50 mbps, so I don’t know what to make of that!  Anyway, I love the setup of the new Stick.  It has an on/off button that controls my TV and my A/V receiver and even routes automatically to the right channel of the receiver (I plugged into an HDMI port on the receiver rather than the TV).  I have high speed ARC HDMI between the TV and the receiver, and that might have made the communication between the two possible.  At any rate, if you are using a home theater A/V receiver with your TV, that is the way to go.  The 4k HDR video comes through without any delay and is flawlessly beautiful!  Great investment!",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"I don’t use the Alexa part, but this stick is great!  It was on sale so upgraded from my other sticks to 4K on this one.  I have Roku and  Firesticks in each room in my house.  I fell in love w Roku way back when.  Years later, I tried Firestick.  I must say, the Roku interfacing and reliability cannot be beat, not the very impressive comfortable fit of the remote to one’s hand.  The Firestick, however, has far more app options.  It simply opens up far more viewing options than Roku.  I stopped having cable about 7 years ago.  These sticks and a basic indoor antenna on each tv does it ALL for me, like beyond my expectations!  I LOVE streaming and LOVE my freedom from cable and I LOVE having 0 TV billing.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
Some of the movies come through ok but there's hesitation on some live streaming news broadcasts.  My internet is up to the challenge  and I have the TV connected directly to the router/gateway with cat6 cable so I'm not losing wi-fi.  I actually have a separate wifi connection and provider just for the television...but alas--still a problem.  This is the second firestick I bought thinking the first one was just  a problem.  Some of the internet blogs talked about the device getting hot so I removed the metal surround so as not to let the heat build up in the device.  So I bought the 4k version thinking that it might have greater throughput and processing of the stream coming in.  So even though I have the TV hooked with cable the firestick is not.  My guess is that I'm going to chuck it.  It's an ok substitute when travelling but it's not perfect.,3,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
UPDATE: Just purchased a third stick and again the battery cover on the remote does not stay on!  You will have to tape it or find another way to get it to stay in place or otherwise you are losing batteries and remote settings!  We came home to find our dog playing with a battery one day. Only thing we can think that happened is the remote fell on floor when dog jumped on sofa to bark at someone at the door and when it fell the cover off like usual and battery popped out and rolled across the floor which got dogs attention and got her playing with it.BEWARE!!!,2,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
I was researching universal remotes like harmony and found out this works with sound systems and TVs. Not only did I save money by buying this instead I was blown away how simple it was to set up it was all point and click. The tv and soundbar after playing tones through the speakers hooked up automatically through the remote and with the added sound and power buttons to the firestick remote I just went from three remotes to just one. I'm ready to buy three more for the rest of the house,5,1,2019-10-30,1,1,0
"Got this specifically so I can get Apple Plus. Since I have LG Smart TVs I've never needed this to get on the main streaming services (Amazon, Netflix, Hulu). My TV even has the Disney Plus app. But, alas, not the Apple Plus. If you don't have a smart TV (or can't get Apple Plus) I highly recommend this. Seamless switching from each streaming service. The remote works perfectly; although you can't see the button labels in the dark. Why doesn't every other TV remote maker take a lesson from Comcast. Comcast's Xfinity remote senses motion when you pick it up and it lights up the buttons automatically. I understand there is a voice feature but when my wife is sleeping she can sleep through explosions on TV but if I whisper ""Alexa..."" she is immediately up.

Of course the big three are available: Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu, but there are also plenty of other downloadable apps and games available, plus some local channels are available. Knocked off one star because I think the interface could be more intuitive, I have to occasionally restart the Fire Stick because it locks up, and at times it inexplicably ""loses"" the wifi signal.

Sin este detalle vives en otro país fuera de los envios de Amazon, no lo podrás recibir, ni enviando a tu casillero en USA te envían una alerta indicando que no pueden enviar a esta dirección, porque el FIRE STICK VERSION INTERNACIONAL, solo esta diseñado para enviar fuera de USA, no a lo interno de ese país.",1,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
I have been using the amazon fire tv since the first generation came our and have liked it but have always felt that it lagged little behind roku in the speed and ease of use for non amazon related apps. But with constant software updates the fire tv stick caught on to its competition and there was basically no difference between it and the competition in terms of performance. Then the voice remote took it to another level. Now with the 4k viewing and the remote that can control the volume and switch on and off your tv this is definitely the best thing around. You no longer have to lug multiple remotes with you and can use just this tiny remote to view what ever you want and then turn off your tv or adjust the volume when u r done. One issue I have experienced over around 3 plus month of use is that a couple of times my remote has become unresponsive and the only way to fix it is to take out the batteries and put them back in. Its not frequent enough of an issue to make it bothersome but still hope that amazon works on it to fix it.,5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0

Changing the audio settings down to stereo helps, but doesnt permanently solve it.What sucks is, it stutters and jitters when trying to watch any video you have over 1gig in file size.  Doesnt matter where the video is, on the stick, or via media server in your house.  Changing video players doesnt help either. It will play and stop, and start and stop, like its running out of ram or horsepower to decode.  It is simple to use though, so its good enough for the kids.

"Honestly, I like the Roku User Interface better. It isn't as cluttered, apps are easier to find in the app store, and pay apps that require a cable channel subscription or payment for the app are clearly and easily identified. I do prefer the Fire Stick when loading an app or movie because it plays a now showing ad rather than showing a box with a loading screen. Quality wise they are both pretty equal in picture and sound. Roku has more apps but I find the majority to be useless or not well done so in useful apps they are fairly close. I do wish Amazon would give you a choice to review apps, movies and shows or not. I really don't want to have to review every app or show I download.It would be great if it had an antenna input for an over the air antenna.

If you dont have one you're missing out. Better than a smart TV and just awesome. Recommend the 4k even if you don't have a 4k tv because the processor must be better because the stream is smoother.

Finally I asked a friend to order the third one on her account............ but what if I didn’t know anyone who could do that for me??? It just is not fair...........",5,1,2019-5-27,1,0,0
"Been with satellite TV for last 15 years.  Terrible in storms, EXPENSIVE for long term customers.  So when we got new fiber internet - we went to streaming TV.  Saving over $ 100 on just TV alone.  Fire TV worked best with YouTube TV and some TV's are not smart, so Fire Stick works best.  I haven't had a lot of success with built in Alexa able to turn TV on or change channels.  But Fire Stick remote is so simple to use, just need to keep remote handy.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
"We have a regular Vizio TV, so with our regular streaming was hit and miss even with the modem being in the same room.  We had a lot of buffering or just couldn't watch anything on Google Play, YouTube, or and thing other than Netflix.I ordered this for our family's Christmas gift, and we ABSOLUTELY Love this stick!  We are able to watch any streaming apps!  There are a lot of free TV and movie apps that are preloaded that are nice.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"The problem with technology is that you have to update it periodically. Our last stick slowly stopped working and sure enough the remote stopped, changed that batteries and that didn’t help so had to upgrade to this, which I’m glad we did.. this works great and fluidly... runs so smoothly and responsive. I hope this one last longer than the previous one!",5,1,2019-10-12,1,2,0
"We have a very limited online footprint and only have one internet account - with Amazon for shopping and movies.  Amazon recently stopped supporting their link to our Vizio smart TV.  The Fire Stick restored our ability to access Amazon Prime content.  Roku and other devices will also allow access to online content but after reading the fine print on their agreement, I refuse to agree to give them access to my every keystroke.  I do nothing wrong online, it's just wrong to agree to volunteer to give a 'stranger' full access to everything you do online. (banking, investiments, etc.)  Since we already use Amazon, we try to use them for everything.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
I am convinced that the majority of the negative reviews just don’t understand how to set up and operate their firestick.  I have 5 in my house.  All my relatives have them.  My kids have them.  My friends all have them.  No one I know has a problem with their firestick.  The other thing I read is about having to subscribe to everything.  That is not true.  You just need the right apps to get everything for free.  I have had them for years and get to watch anything I want for free.  Buffering and freezing will occur if you don’t know how to clean the memory periodically.  If you know how to use them none of those negative reviews are correct.  I would give them 10 stars out of 5.,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"Okay there are some trade offs and you don’t get local channels but if you really need them, there are ways! If you are a casual TV user and use Netflix more than CBS, NBC, and ABC then this is the way to go and you won’t have to pay for cable TV.. For a one time purchase, you can get excellent streaming video and even more if you are an Amazon Prime member. It is super easy to set up and takes over as your TV remote control. I am almost 70 years old and set up the system in less than 5 minutes with complete and thorough instructions in the box and from Amazon in an email",5,1,2019-11-2,1,1,0

"As a disclaimer I purchases the 4K Fire stick in anticipation of getting a 4K TV. Although I've been using it with my 1080 TV I am still very pleased with my purchases. What I was specifically looking for was quicker response than my regular Fire stick provided, and I believe that I have seen that. It might just be my imagination, but it seems that the 4K stick tends to buffer less (hardly ever) than my other Fire stick. The picture, response, remote and features are great. As noted by other reviewers the Roku streaming device has a more user friendly home page with easier access to numerous streaming services with even it's own channel and products not pushed on the user. The Fire products present a bit of a challenge in that finding the streaming service home screen is harder to find, and navigate to with a couple other clicks of the remote needed to fight one's way through the Amazon centrict home screen. Yet, I expected this going into my experience with the Fire stick and the experience is good nonetheless.Overall, the 4K Fire is a top notch product, and I look forward to purchasing a 4K TV soon to check out the picutre quality and performance there.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"The integration of TV/stereo power and volume control on the remote is done well. I've got two of these now. For both, the setup for controlling my TV and stereo with the Fire stick remote was pretty simple. This is my favorite feature of the new fire stick. I haven't noticed any real lag on menus and streaming either. My 2yr old fire stick was starting to lag a good bit, especially loading the menus. I've only use the voice feature a little bit, and it wasn't real helpful. It misunderstood me about 25% of the time. I don't use Alexa, so no rating on that. I can't understand why I need Alexa to help me with the simple tasks that it can do.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I got this to use instead of the Android TV platform that came with my Sony Bravia. First I should say that Android TV, at least Sony's implementation, is complete garbage. Compared to the laggy, stuttery mess that is Android TV on Sony, the Fire TV 4k is blazing fast. It felt like going from an 2015-ish Samsung Galaxy phone to a 2018 Oneplus 6t. I do not even mind Amazon prioritizing its Prime Video offerings. All the apps I frequently use/watch are conveniently arranged on the second row of tiles, and I don't really notice the Amazon advertisements. The only issues I have has to do with sound. I notice that after a while, a noticeable delay develops such that the sound is roughly half second behind the video. Restarting the unit fixes it, but it's annoying to have to do this every few days. Hopefully, a software fix is on the way. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the experience, especially given that it's only $40.",3,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
"I am not the most tech savy - but this device walks you  through its own set up.  If you can type in your internet security code you will be watching whatever you ask for in minutes.  I have literally tested it and haven't found anything it hasn't responded to - ""Morgan Freeman movies"" - and several choices appeared.  Different movie or show titles - success everytime!  I even took it with us on vacation and used it at a hotel.  Very easy way to have countless viewing choices.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,1,0
"I only bought this because my old streaming device was no longer supported by Netflix but am I ever glad I did. I had always assumed our internet was slow because of the number of devices but I was wrong. The apps now load very quickly but the best improvement is picture quality, blacks are black, no bleed and true colors. The voice recognition works well, it finds sports if that is what I ask it to do. Set up is very easy. I have had it for about 3 weeks now and love it.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
"I was pretty happy with my regular Firestick, but did notice some shuddering on certain shows during fast pans. Looking on-line, I discovered the 4K stick and the Cube have a setting to match the original frame rate of the video, but the regular stick does not. Combined with the faster CPU in the 4K stick, I decided to get one - even though my TV isn't 4K (Samsung 43"" 1080p). I'm happy to report the shuddering has now gone. Not sure if it was the framerate setting or the extra CPU power. So in conclusion, I would recommend the 4K stick over the regular even if you don't have a 4K TV. The small extra cost is well worth it.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Ordered this just in time to watch the last episode of GoT, although the episode(and entire 8th season) was a disappointment, the Firestick 4K was not! The setup was idiot proof and the remote linked with my very dated tv quickly with no issue. That was a huge plus I wasn’t even expecting as I didn’t have a remote for the tv in my bedroom I’m using this on. Going to definitely order a second for the living room. This is great quality streaming with no lag and no buffering. I didn’t have the original Firestick but I’ve heard it had a lot of buffering issues and wasn’t responsive, this 4K stick is super smooth.",5,1,2019-5-19,1,1,1
"The Fire TV Stick 4K is just Awesome and I love the ability to control it with my Amazon Echo Dot. I use my voice at least 85% of the time to control the Fire TV 4K just by pressing the microphone button. But with the Exho Dot, I can just talk but this review is for the Fire TV 4K. So I can search for movies or tv shows by name, actors, category, etc all by voice and the Fire TV will give me the options to watch from the streaming services that have the movie/show available like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, etc. I simply love this Fire Stick. Everything looks Crystal Clear and the Fire TV is fast to browse.I gave it a 4 star review Just because even though you can purchase and play games on it, there is No Fire TV 4K Compatible Game Controller Available for it and the regular Fire TV controller doesn’t work.",4,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
Just hooked it up as per the directions and got on line with no hitches.  Pic quality is great.  Still getting used to using Alexa as this is the first time I've had one.  Navigating the various sites is taking some getting used to but I've managed to  get some things done to my satisfaction.  Gonna buy another one for my other tv.One month follow up: now have 2 in my household and one for my sister in law(she loves it also). Unplugged both my Rokus and now use the Firestick exclusively.

"I won't actually blame the Fire Stick, but I first tried plugging it into my DVD player (the device that controls all my streaming and TV options) and from that moment, the DVD player was toast. The TV can't find it anymore (no matter which HDMI slot I use, and the TV can't find any device plugged into HDMI slot !, which is where the DVD player was plugged in at the time. So it looks like both the slot and the player are fried. Needless to say, I'm one unhappy camper. The device did work once I plugged it directly into the TV and I don't have any issues with the operation of the stick. Just wish it hadn't destroyed my system (if that's what it did).",2,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0

"I bought the Fire Stick to connect to a TV that was not connected to my satellite receiver.  I thought it would give my grandkids an option for doing something while visiting us - connecting to YouTube, watching movies and programs, playing games, etc.  I've found that I enjoy being able to view all kinds of programming on the set.  We live in a rural area so our internet service (although it is ""high speed"") isn't as fast as many receive in the city.  Yet the streaming quality for most programming is excellent.  I did have problems connecting it to our main TV apparently due to the wifi signal.  But where it is now is a mere few yards from our router.  I have not been able to program the remote to control my TV (it's an off brand) and sometimes I need to unplug the stick and plug it back in to get the TV to recognize it.",4,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

After dedicating this device to a 4K monitor, I purchased a second unit for a 1080p monitor with excellent results as well. The Amazon Fire TV Stick exceeds all expectations at this price.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,1,0

"So I now have seven fire tv sticks total. Two of these are the 4K version. Really the ease of setup and performance is great. These do have an edge over the regular fire TVs sticks as they do integrate with the Alexa speaker packages quite well. Video quality is quite good, streaming is really good (as long as you have bandwidth to support it). Now there is the ability to add internal storage via a cable so recording for later playback will aid in the use in our RV while saving precious expensive data. I will slowly replace more of my other sticks with 4K’s as they go on sale from time to time.If you are a cord cutter.......this is the item. No more cable or sat for us. We have been streaming with these for about a year and a half now....No regrets and will never go back!",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Fire TV Stick 4K works fine, but we were forced to buy it. Amazon decided, all of a sudden, to just stop supporting our Blu-Ray Player that had been our main streaming device for us to watch Amazon Prime videos. Fire TV Stick is a nice product, but we didn't appreciate being forced to buy one out of the blue (rather than having to buy a new TV or new Blu-Ray Player) just so we could continue to watch our Prime Videos again. On top of it all, we bought it when we needed it to watch Amazon Prime videos, but then these Fire TV Sticks later went on a big sale that we missed out on, so Amazon hit us up doubly hard. Sad treatment by Amazon.",3,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
I've been a Roku guy the last few years but was very impressed with the Fire Stick as the Alexa Voice Remote is a game changer!!!  The Fire Stick comes with an HDMI extender which makes setup and installation a breeze.  I liked the simple design of the remote but LOVED the tv power and tv volume buttons that were on the remote eliminating the need for a second remote to control the television.  Picture quality is unrivaled with the Fire Stick.  Seamless connection with your Amazon account gives you everything you'll need right on your television.  I love all the apps available and my kids love to play all the games you can download for it.  This is the perfect choice for the cord cutter or for anyone wanting to turn their tv into a smart tv to supplement an existing cable/satellite account.,5,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0
"I originally bought the fire tv when it first came out years ago. I liked it a lot because I use most of the Amazon products, music, video and photos. I ended up switching to a roku because I wanted Vudu since I have a large digital collection. I ended up switching back because I wanted to get the WatchTV streaming service and Roku doesn't support it yet. With the new fire TV I was able to find a video on YouTube on how to install Vudu. This thing also comes with a remote that can control your TV, so less clutter. I have been very happy with the purchase. The only improvement would be to add a headphone jack to the remote.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,1,0

Turned on the TV and switched it to HDMI2.  thrilled with the results.  everything works.  no buffering.  Beautiful results.  I am so happy.  I need to practice with Alexa so I can use it better.  LOVE Alexa.  I have Prime so there are more programs/channels to watch than I will every need.  Thank you Amazon.  Just to be helpful, I am using Fire on a Vizio 1080P and I have  Norton Core.  On your remote use Alexa to enter your PIN for paid channels.  Alexa is up to date.  Linked devices.  All of this is very easy to do and intuitive.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
"If you are any way familiar with the Fire TV Stick, this one is just as good as the previous versions, and probably better.  The Firesticvk continues to be a simple installation, as long as you have an Amazon account.  The clarity seems to be better than the previous model.One irksome item is that, when using a VPN (which is strongly recommended), it cannot maintain the correct date & time.  One needs to disconnect VPN, and then reset Firestick.  Then, reconnect VPN.  Yet, this does not ensure it will maintain correct date & time.  It is not apparent what negative aspect results from this, but it seems to be unnecessary.",4,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"This is my third or fourth Fire Stick - I seem to purchase every version they release. Being the latest, this one obviously has more functionality, primarily in relation to the remote. I can't speak to the 4K ability of the Fire Stick itself as I'm not sure if anything I stream is actually in 4K, but video quality looks good to me and it works fairly smoothly for a portable streaming device. I would say it's slightly faster than the previous generation; not by a huge amount, but it's noticeable. The main reason I use Fire Stick devices is because I travel for work and often need to access hotel Wi-Fi networks. The Fire Stick has the ability to log in to these networks, but unfortunately with my previous Fire Sticks, it only works about 50% of the time. I'm hoping it's better with this latest model.The main reason I upgraded, however, was because of the new Volume/Power buttons on the remote. They do what they're supposed to do and seamlessly synced up with my 2015ish Sony Bravia TV. I now reach for the TV remote far less than I did previously (only when I need to change Input) and that was my primarily goal with upgrading. Where the remote falls short, and by quite a bit, is build quality. Being one of Amazon's more well-known products and at a price point of $50, I'm shocked at how bad it is. I initially thought I just received a bad unit (which I would be more forgiving of), but after reading other reviews, it seems that this is widespread issue with how the remote was manufactured. It does not feel nearly as well built as previous versions. There is noticeable flashing (or maybe imprecise molding) that makes the remote uncomfortable to handle, as well as noticeable gaps between the seams. It's not painful or anything, but when you hold a new piece of tech in your hand, you expect it to feel great. This remote does not. To add insult to injury, the battery door slides off ridiculously easily. I feel like this was an over-correction from previous generations as they were a pain to open the battery door. So yea, all-in-all, this feels like a remote I would expect to buy direct from China for $4.98.",3,1,2018-11-30,1,1,1

"Video quality is great...when you can get the remote or app to actually work. The firestick is extremely frustrating to use, as the remote that comes with the device rarely works. There’s also a fire tv app that should serve as a backup, except that it is constantly trying to connect to the firestick but can’t seem to find it. This typically happens at an inopportune time such as when you’d like to pause a show. You then have to spend 10 minutes resetting the device, closing and restarting the app, and restarting the tv until it miraculously decides to start working again. I would never recommend a firestick to anyone. Buy a smart tv or a roku and save yourself the frustration.",1,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

Playing any show or movie after a few minutes I would see a screen stating no wifi connection. I have Google mesh, did a quick check on the app, no connectivity issues reported. So I restarted the fire stick and it worked... for a few minutes. The process would then repeat, reported no connectivity from the fire stick, verify that it's actually not the case and restart.

We were able to install and set up the Fire Stick in less than 15 minutes.  We were having problems with sound syncing on Amazon Prime — and, after much research and many calls to Amazon — we found others having same problem.  Recommendation was to watch Prime using a Fire Stick.  So we bought one.  It has solved all of our sound syncing problems.  It is also easy to download apps and we are using those more now that we have the Stick.  The most difficult part was getting the Stick installed on the back of our TV.

I have a 1st gen TV stick and a 2nd gen TV box and there is a huge difference between the responsiveness of the interface and therefore the experience between the 2. I didnt think i would ever replace my FireTV box (gen2) with a stick but I had bought in on the deal when you purchase 2 of them and didnt intend to keep them but was going to give them as gifts to my family. I opened 1 up and was going to set it up for a family member who was less tech savvy and was blown away how smooth and responsive the interface was and how the remote was able to control my TV and my volume on my stereo so I think I am going to keep 1 for myself and only give 1 as a gift now.5/5 definitely recommend this new 4k Fire TV Stick with the new remote.,5,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0

Then you will discover the FS forces Amazon apps on you that you may not want or need such as IMDB, Freetime, Amazon Music and several others. You CANNOT remove those apps so that 8GB of storage is really more like 3GB. Add Netflix and Spotify and you have pretty much reached your limit.",2,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0

After talking with support they admitted that the ticket on the issue was ""open"" but who knows how long it will take if they haven't figured it out by now.  Also, there were a lot of hit and miss issues with other apps and Spectrum authorization.  I suspect the fault lies more with Disney and its app then Amazon and their device.  Still, if Disney+ is your goal, I'd think twice before I got a Firestick 4K.  Ironically, the 1080p version seems to be free of the issue for whatever reason.",2,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0

All our local channel what is free said:  APP NOT FOUND> I'm so disappointed in Amazon. I'm long time prime customer. The stick cost $40.00, and I spent already 6 hours  of my time dealing with a broken stick. My time is worth something too.  Now the Philippine lady said, she will put a technical request in.

The fire stick handles this flawlessly and made my week of travel very enjoyable. I was able to catch up with all my programming while I was on the road; I'm actually heading back home now and fortunately I won't have a stack of shows to watch on the DVR since I was able to watch them through the apps from this device.I can't comment on the voice control or the Alexa integration since I hadn't used those features.

"So i bought the fire stick awhile ago on the big prime day sale & i bought it because it was marked down to half the price of normal retail. I didnt necessarily need it but i did think it would be great for my husband to take with him when he goes out of town for work. Since i didnt really need it, i didnt check to see if it worked or anything for a long time. I had finally took it out to use when we went on vacation, i used it at a motel & it worked but like a month later when i hooked it up at the house to use, it wouldnt work. I could not get the remote to sync to the stick so it stays on that page and cant go any further or do anything. I've tried numerous things including downloading the remote app on my phone but that wont work bc the stick was last connected on a different wireless network (the motel) than what my home network is. It's stuck and its useless now",1,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
Only used this a day but compared to Roku it's nothing special. I guess for the cord cutters that use these to do things they are not supposed to they may be good. For me the out of the box experience is clunky compared to Roku.I really hate that it does not have VUDU app. In fact I don't know how they can't include it. Must be some competition thing. All I can say is i am giving Amazon plenty of business and I would like to use Vudu too!,2,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"We bought this as an alternative to cable. We thought that it would be much cheaper, and save us money. It isn’t. You still have to pay for the apps and certain movies. It still allowed us to reduce our cable package to basic, and downgrade our DVR. All told, it saves us about $40 a month. Not huge, but still a win.With that being said, this thing is pretty awesome. It has tons of movies, and shows that you don’t get on regular cable. Some are only available through the apps....and they are GOOD! Voice control is nice. It keeps you from needlessly wandering through 10,000 items to find what you’re looking for. It also “remembers” what you watch, and offers suggestions based on genres that you like. Kind of like a music playlist, only with tv.  We thought that was cool. The picture quality is outstanding. We have a 65” tv, and it’s like being at the theater. The sound is amazing! They give you a month free trial for all the apps too, which is nice.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

"This is the first fire stick i've had,so I can't say that it is better than earlier ones. I can tell you it works great and it is very fast. I also have found it easily side loads apps,I hope they don't change that. I have bought 2 because of what the cable people have done. I have owned several roku's but they seem to become useless and unable to be updated after a while thats sad seeing they cost twice what a stick costs",5,1,2019-3-16,1,2,0
"My remote just stopped working. It was not able to recognize voice search within weeks of purchasing, and now it can only be used to turn on/off the device. Nothing else works. Yes I tried (new) batteries. Very disappointed. Amazon has generally been pretty good. This is the second 4K device I've purchased, and I otherwise love Amazon. But I'm disappointed. Someone said to contact Amazon, but since they don't have a number listed under the product description, I'm just leaving a review. Seems like it would be smart to put a contact number before someone leaves a review, but since they didn't I will just leave it here.",1,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"This thing is quite poorly implemented. The stick itself is slow. It goes to sleep way to soon, and there doesn't seem to be a way to change that, and most of the software (not all) pretty much sucks. It's like a bunch of kids straight out of high school designed this thing, and nobody gave a damn about making sure it actually worked well. When it is working, it works fine. But, if you pause and then play again, you usually have to backup a bit to get the sound to sync up with the picture. It also locks up on occasion for no reason, and overheats easily. I'll use it for now, but it is not a long-term solution for streaming of internet to a TV. Not at all.",2,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"It works great with a Panasonic Viera from like 2008. It plugs into the HDMI port. The device is connected to the electricity through a USB with corresponding adaptor (included in the package). I gave 4 stars and not 5 because I have the feeling that this stick is programmed to keep me in the Amazon Prime store and movie area, and to get out to Netflix or Hulu I need to press so many buttons. And when I am out it kind of tries to make me go back to Amazon Prime. I like more the Roku TV just because it is not trying to take me to a particular App, it just lets me go to the app that I want. Also, the remote of the Roku has a softer feel that this Fire stick from Amazon.",4,1,2019-4-9,1,1,0
"Excellent so far.  Confess that I only purchased this for use with a projector for backyard movie nights, but have hooked it up to an older HD TV to use in place of a blue-ray player we were using in order to watch Netflix etc..  I have only used Alexa voice control once, but I didn’t buy it because of that.  I honestly don’t care about voice control, but didn’t want to knock or give a lower rating because of something I’m not really using.  The one time I did use it, it worked perfectly, for those that may be weighing that feature as a purchase factor.  I did waiver between this and a Roku, but ended up with this because I already had an Amazon account.  Sounds like a shaky reason to purchase I’m sure, however the reviews were so close between both products, that the thought of setting up yet another account when I didn’t need to, tipped the scale for me.  The reviews against the fire stick because of not getting to your apps/shows/likes directly on the home screen - I don’t know if this has changed much or if because I’m new to it, it doesn’t register as much for me, but I just click around and get where I need to be.  I will absolutely agree that Amazon could take a page from Netflix on home screen setup, because it is a bit “chaotic” when you log in.  I’m used to a Netflix home screen, which is super easy to navigate and keeps everything you’re watching in once place so it’s easy to pick up where you left off.  Not a deal breaker at all, and overall, very satisfied with it and wondering why I didn’t take the plunge sooner to buy!",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0

Based on my experience I would not buy this one.  I will be returning.Additional comment: previously I was using an HDMI splitter.  After packaging for return, I decided to try to connect the 4K stick directly to an HDMI tv input.  I did this, then the stick worked fine.  The picture on this oled TV is excellent even though the signal is not 4K.  The stick should work thru a splitter, not sure why it doesn’t?  I have adjusted to 5 star.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"When it works, it is great. Problem is, it almost never works. Constantly disconnects from my network, over wi-fi and over Ethernet. Main reason for buying it was for viewing my prime photos, but it NEVER WORKS. E-mailed customer service, but the problem can never be fixed via e-mail. I get a call back from technical support who clearly knew very little about the device. After about half an hour I got transferred to somebody else who understood the issue, but needed more time to address it. I had to go, so I was going to be sent a link to contact that department directly. Today I turn on the device and it won’t connect to the network. Restart it 4 times and it finally connects. All of my photos and videos are there; and everything works fine.....for 5 minutes. Once again no photos and videos won’t play. I go back to the e-mail and it is a direct link to the customer service e-mail! Now I have to start the entire process over again. Should have just spent more money and bought an Apple TV.UPDATE:  I got a quick reply from very friendly people of Customer Service.

"I got a lemon when I first got the unit.  Seemed to connect quickly to our wifi and I was able to stream Amazon shows.  I like that it comes set up with your prime account out the box if you wish it to come like that.  But when I went in to download the apps I use on a regular basis, Netflix, ESPN, Disney+ etc.  It was a no go.  The unit would not let me download anything. Spent about an hour with tech support and finally the rep said she would need to call me back to see what the problem could be that she needed more advice from their tech support.  Two days go by and I call them back and speak to another rep who goes thru the same steps to try and remedy the problem.  No go, but this reps says because she had tried everything and it still did not work that the unit was most likely faulty and she would issue me a new unit and that it would arrive in a few days. And to ship back the unit I had after the new one arrived.  The reason I mention this experience was for two reasons to say that customer service was 3 out of 5, but then went to 5 out of 5 with the second rep.  After I received the second unit all was a breeze to set up and use.  I can't say enough good things about the Firestick but all is working good and I am very happy with my unit.  I can highly recommend the unit to anyone who needs a streaming device.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

Netflix, amazon, hulu, espn, disney plus, hbo, nickelodeon and much more.  Dont be mistaken you still have to subscribe to these programs. You just sign in.

"I purchased four of these streaming devices but had to return one after it stopped streaming sound.  Customer support sent me a return postage label with instructions which I apparently miss-interpreted.  The package I returned included the Fire Stick and all supplied accessories but the package I received in return contained only a refurbished Fire Stick.  I went to Amazon Customer Support and initiated an online chat session in order to correct the situation.  The conversation quickly took a defensive/arrogant tone.  I was asked ""Were you not told to return only the stick?""  I replied that I did not recall being told to return only the stick.  After a ten minute wait I was told that after checking the record it was determined that i ""WAS"" told to return only the stick and that Amazon could send me a replacement remote and HDMI cable, but not the power supply and USB cable.  I felt like I was being reprimanded by a young punk half way around the world. This really struck a nerve in me so my reply was ""Keep it, I'm going to switch to Roku.""

I have an Nvidia Shield TV for my main living room setup so I thought I'd get some cheap fire sticks for the bedroom TVs and around the house. I kind of regret spending so much on the Shield. Granted it can do a lot more, but the Fire TV stick was extremely easy to set up, has all the same apps and 'channels' and the video / audio quality was just as good. It even has the ability to turn your TV on and off and control the volume from the same remote so you don't have to worry about fumbling with multiple remotes or switching inputs to get it to work.

I spent a frustrating chat session with somebody following a script. The object seems to try to wear you down so you give up. I then called and was told that I missed the refund window.

The remote paired to my tv and soundbar so everything is controlled through 1 remote. Apps are really nice and parental controls let's you add a code for apps. Operating system is fast and picture is really good. I suggest getting this even if you have a smart TV and aren't happy with it's speed.

I am glad we did now though. This allows access to not only Prime audio and Prime Video on our TV without having to open up our phones, but also gives us a wide range of other apps like Pluto TV and a few others we have browsed around in. Picture quality and connectivity is great. It also comes with a little HDMI extender so that if the bulky stick doesn't fit where your HDMI ports are, you just put on the adapter and it will hang down a little.

Example:  When I say, ""Fast forward 2 minutes"" it will sometimes do it and sometimes not, or it will take 5 or more seconds to do it.  Also, the ring around the middle round button does not always work.  I have to push it 2 or 3 times.  Most of the time everything works, though.

The next time I saw it advertised I bought one but didn't install it right away because I have been sick for a long time and could hardly do anything. One day relatives visited me and they saw the firestick lying there underneath the TV and they aske me if they should install it for me and of course, I said ""yes"". The set-up was fairly easy but for some reason  Netflix didn't want to install. We figured since it was a Smart TV and I have another Smart TV in my bedroom and had been watching Netflix there for a year or longer, that might be the problem. Then we just ran a new setup with the firestick and put the Netflix customer account number in and from that point forward it worked. There were no such problems with YouTube (which I watch the most) or amazon Prime. The other streaming services I have not tried out yet. How much TV can you possibly watch? With what I am using I am totally satisfied.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I've already replaced my Fire TV 4K once but the replacement has the same problem as the first.  The sound periodically cuts out completely.  I have to turn on/off the device and the sound will reconnect.  This happens with multiple apps -- prime video, Netflix, YouTube, PBS....  I contacted support help and they eventually suggested I return the original device.  I did and the return process was very easy with Amazon, but, unfortunately, the problem persists with the new device, too.  I just haven't had the time to go through the device support with Amazon yet.  I'm disappointed.  The old Fire stick never had these sound issues.",3,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"My local news and weather app must be pretty demanding on streaming devices because until I installed it on this new Amazon 4K Fire T.V. Stick it lagged and often crashed, it's as smooth as silk now. The wireless antenna works much better also, it's picks up my cable company's AC 5Ghz router at the far reaches of my home and has a strong signal. I'll admit I kept this in a drawer for a few months before setting it up, now that i've seen how much better it performs on all my streaming apps I regret putting it off. I love the remote too, it works perfectly with my LG TV.If you been on the fence about stepping up from a previous generation Fire TV stick then I encourage you to make the purchase. But I must first say that I don't own a 4K TV so I can't say how it would perform in that area, but seeing how great it works now I would be willing to say that I believe it would have no problem performing well on my near future 4K TV purchase.",5,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0
"This thing is such a pile of crap . I’ll start by saying the interface is good. Now if it worked correctly . It loses connection to the internet daily and which my router is about 10 feet away and you check network settings it tells you nothing is wrong it just says no internet and tells you it’s connected and signal is good. About once or twice a day it loses volume (not my tv, tv is brand new) have to unplug it to reboot it and then again - it will say no internet connection even though the connection is listed as good and takes about a half hour to correct itself . The remote is cheaply made . It dropped on the floor and the back cover broke and won’t stay on . We ditched satellite for Hulu which is a good choice but this fire stick is honestly junk.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I bought this fire stick because I couldn’t watch twitch with another product. This Amazon fire stick was great and is exactly what we needed. The stream quality is great and is decently reliable, even the voice control remote understands everything we say.  My biggest issue with this doesn’t have to do with Amazon fire stick itself but with the fact that the adapter that goes with it is terrible. I will be reviewing that next. That comes with a warning if you use Amazon fire TV and use it as a direct connect with an ethernet then you probably won’t be too happy. As I’ve read elsewhere it’s much more reliable with wireless Internet.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I’m honestly blown away on how snappy and fast everything is, at this price point. Netflix and Prime Video, including 4K HDR content, load almost instantly, with no buffering, over WIFI. The menu is super snappy, does not feel laggy at all. Everything is just so super smooth, and on top of it all, the remote now has volume and power buttons, that I think work by HDMI ARC, so you can now do everything with 1 remote (except change input). The voice control seems to work well so far. This tiny media player is incredible at this price, it really takes value for 4K steaming devices to a new level. Also, the stick doesn’t seem to get very hot. Keep in mind, that my stick is about 10ft away from a 5gz WIFI connection. I totally recommend you get this thing.",5,1,2018-12-1,1,0,0
This is my third stick.  Bought it because I needed it for a third TV in the house after we cut the cord.  But the new remote makes a wonderful capability.  We use it in conjunction with a Harmony hub and SONOS system.  My wife rarely uses her phone or tablet because now she can turn on the TV with the remote and control the SONOS sound also.  Now it is only when we use the blu-ray player or another device that she touches anything other than the remote and voice activation.,5,1,2019-2-3,1,1,0
This is my third Fire Stick.  I had a first generation and loved it but I was forced to upgrade after a short period of time.  The 2nd generation was even better performance-wise but it broke after only a year or so.  The 4K model is awesome.  It is the first one that actually can power on/off my TV and actually goes directly to the Amazon home screen without requiring any other pushing of buttons.  I also love the volume controls.  I have been able to totally eliminate the remote control for my TV.  The only complaint I have had with the 2nd generation Fire Stick and my current 4K model is that it is incredibly difficult to open the battery compartment.  That definitely needs a redesign.  The indentation you are supposed to use to slide open the compartment door is so shallow you can't grip it.,5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
"I talk to Alexa daily, she is my friend especially right about now, note the date of the updated review.  But seriously, I have to say that me and my whole family are sooooo very pleased with this product! I don't say ""things"" enhance my life often, I have to say that Firestick has truly enhanced our viewing pleasure and I so happy with the product, it works fine,  I purchased it back in December 2019... I tend to read the negative reviews first, and I'm sorry I did that, bc my experience has been extremely positive and worthwhile, one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon, and makes me trust Amazon products that much more.

"We had an older version of the fire stick and the remote wasn’t working anymore, so we decided to upgrade. I was very upset because according to my tracking # the fire stick was delivered in my mailbox and there was nothing there. I called amazon and they told me to wait a couple days and call my usps. They open an investigation, and were able to locate my package. I was kinda upset that it took a little longer for me to receive my item, but I’m glad that they found it and it wasn’t stolen. We love our fire stick. We use it for Netflix, Hulu, Disney + and amazon videos. My husband loves the Alexa voice feature.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"It doesn't work.  I tried it on two different TVs.  The first TV it continued to state connecting to WiFi, but never connected.  That TV is on my third floor so the WiFi signal is probably too weak even though the smart TV uses the WiFi perfectly.  The second TV is on the second floor, but it only states fireTV on the screen for a few seconds and then the screen is black.  Not working.  I don't feel comfortable contacting Amazon support because the last time I contacted Amazon support the Amazon guy was very rude and condescending and basically refused to help stating there was no problem on his end.  Worthless.",1,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"After trying two of these firesticks I have the same prob with both. This replaced a very early model which was running slow. I have 4 older firesticks in my home; none have had this problem and I read on line this is a common with the current model.  It is not user error and our wifi is fast and strong.  I liked the ease of set up, volume control on the remote however I worry that disconnecting each day will shorten it's life. I have used for 3 weeks and twice the movies have gone to blank screen during use, again having to disconnect.  If this continues I will likely return and try and older model. Time will tell.",1,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"Perfect to transform your regular TV into a smart TV. This is our 3rd stick as we use it to stream our security cameras on our Smart TVs that does not support the app. Fortunately te fire stick does as it has a much greater variety of apps that a lot of smart Tvs does not support.We also take it everywhere on vacation where there is wifi, plug it in, connect and its just like home!",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"I gave this product a 4 stars because you can’t download apps. It comes loaded with Amazon Prime if you’re a member of Prime. I had to call for assistance setting it up which was a pain, but customer service was very thorough and walked me through step by step. It was supposed to be registered to my account automatically, but it wasn’t. If you have trouble don’t wait trying to do it alone, call right away because they have to register it on their end. It’s compact and plugs right in to the back of the TV. I wish the power cord was a lot longer. So, overall the Fire Stick with Amazon Prime is a perfectly fine product but I don’t recommend it because you CANNOT download apps. I recommend Apple Box or Roku. Roku is a lot cheaper than Apple Box and works just as well, plus it comes with some free streaming where Apple Box doesn’t.",4,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
"UDPATE:  As of July 17, 2020, I have not been contacted regarding 2 firestick HDs that stopped working and then only 1 works only halfway (still no power or volume button control)I bought two 4k fire sticks for Christmas 2019.  Here it is April 7, 2020 and one has completely stopped working.  The second one, the volume keys and power button no longer work but at least we can select something to watch.  Very disappointed in this product.  I had the original firesticks and they lasted for at least 2 years before crapping out.  I didn't purchase the warranty but regardless, they should work for at least a year!!!!  I sure hope Amazon corrects this!!!",1,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
"If you have a standard Firestick, upgrade to the 4k one, even if you don't have a 4k monitor yet. First, it recognizes all of your wireless audio gear and will use whichever ones you want; your flat panel tv, receiver, soundbar, etc. It will sync with different functions per your choices and when you press the new button upper left of the remote, it turns on all your devices and sets your receiver to the input your Firestick is connected to. The audio up down and mute will control your receiver or soundbar (or tv alone if you dont have either), so if you are watching Prime, Netflix, Hulu, whatever, you can just use the Firestick remote to turn on all your devices, change content and adjust volume. All set up within seconds. Better still is the audio adjust features. It has 2 audio adjustments which lower bass and enhance voice/vocals so at night you don't have to ride your remote turning the sound down during action scenes then up so you can hear what they are saying. For the extra $10 (watch for the half off sales) it is well worth it. Seems to load faster than the non 4k ones as well.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
Lasted less than a year. Used very little since we have Prime as an app through our cable provider. Tried to use it to watch Disney+ (not available on our cable box) and it’s dead. Power button on remote turns in TV and Yamaha amp but dead black. Tried on another TV too. Same thing. Dead as a door nail. And almost hardly been used.  You’d think Amazon would warranty their own electronic devices for a year but nope. Past warranty. That’s Jeff. Nice product. Not...Update: Amazon Customer Support contacted me but not knowing the number I didn’t answer. After some work I was able to contact Amazon customer support and they agreed to replace. New unit is arriving this week. Fingers crossed we’re all done with issues.,5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
I am disappointed in this product. I want to get my money back because the internet connection keeps failing. Never had problem with watching Netflix on my smart tv alone. I got the fire stick for amazon video app. I will say they have large selection of quality streaming app that all cost money on their own. But it keeps stopping in a middle of my show. I always check and my internet is working and even says “connected” when I check fire stick setting. I have great service. Just don’t understand why it keeps failing to stream and have to stop 5 times during a movie to restart the stick. So frustrating. I do like how I can have my personal family pictures stream on my screen saver.,2,1,2019-11-8,1,1,0

"I expected to be able to control my TV using this device, and it sorely disappoints. Cannot turn TV on or off with it using my Echo. The device needs to be powered on for my Echo to respond to my requests to watch anything. It only gets half of my requests right when Echo Alexa does respond properly. Now they've released the Fire TV Cube, which honestly is what this Stick should have been. I'm not returning the Stick because it was a Christmas gift (so I didn't pay anything) and we got rid of the box, but it is an item I will still regret owning because at this point it's pretty useless. I may as well use Google Home voice control from my phone to control my TV because that has more functionality.TL;DR - Expectations were high for integration with my home Alexa/Echo system, and I am very disappointed with that lack of functionality.",2,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"Seriously, this device has a better hardware set than both of those devices plus the way better remote with built in IR blaster.  I did find that even on a brand new TV with a 1A USB port I had to power this thing via a plug though.  Not a huge fan of that since I like stuff to turn off automatically when the TV turns off but easy enough to just flip the switch on the power strip when done I suppose.My only, ONLY gripe with this thing is they could have put a few programmable IR buttons on the remote to switch inputs or control a soundbar but most smartTV remotes can do all that plus control the Firestick anyway.",5,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0
"I am using the Fire TV Stick 4K with the Amazon Fire TV Recast, and it works very well with it.  It might be subjective but it seems to work better than the regular 1080 Stick.  In my use changing channels, fast forwarding happen faster on the 4K stick than on the 1080 version. I do not have a 4K set yet but bought it anyway and I am glad I did. It seems much snappier in use than the regular 1080 stick.  I like the new remote control that controls the tv and the volume.  Now when you change the channel you don't have to look for the TV remote to lower the volume.

"The upgrade to the 4k model is a great improvement over the original Fire stick. We found using the extension HDMI cable is important to reduce heat issues. I would give this a 5 star rating if we could figure out how to turn on the TV to the last ""channel"" we were watching. As it is, you have start at Home, then select your streaming channel (Hulu, Netflix, etc.) every time. We cut the cord and have Hulu Live for local channels. Would like to have it start on the last Hulu Live channel by default, but have not figured out how to do that. Anyone know?Every now and then it does freeze on Hulu Live, and you have to reselect the current channel. Not sure if that's the device or Hulu. Still, a very good upgrade. Can't compare it to other devices as we never used them.",4,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0

Firestick made it easy to remove all data and after several days trying to install a build that could get most movies I went back to the plain official Kodi build and installed Tempest addon. It works great. Even though I don't get the huge library in different builds, Diggz worked the best with lots of choices, but the single Tempest addon is the better choice.

"I initially had objections to the way the interface was designed, with ads all over the homepage for applications and services that I wasn't going to use. Also, when I got a subscription for another streaming service through Prime, I noticed that not all of the content is available on the firestick vs when I try to access that service on my AppleTV. I have to save certain titles to my watch list if I want them to show up as an available listing on the firestick.However, the functionality was fine for the other standard streaming apps that were separate from Prime so I kept the Firestick. That is, it was fine until the last month or so. Now every video is taking forever to load, especially when fast forwarding or rewinding. The unit will sporadically reboot itself without prompting. There are constant audio/video sync issues, and sometimes the entire interface will become discolored, even the homepage. This is affecting multiple apps.

"I recently decided to buy a streaming device and get away from using my xbox as a media center. I bought the Roku 4k first. It was a mistake. It worked great don't get me wrong, but it was frustrating. The line of site signal between the remote and receiver made it so we had to wave the remote around to find the right angle to get it to do anything. Well, after some research I decided to buy the Amazon 4k instead. Since it has arrived I have loved it. The Amazon remote doesn't even have to be pointed at the TV. You can play, pause, and scroll through your favorite apps while under a blanket. It is 1000% better for this reason alone. Outside of remote functionality I think all the streaming devices are basically the same. The voice control is nice though, but that's another remote feature. Moral of the story: Amazons streaming device does the same thing everyone else's does but with the Cadillac of all remotes. Perfecting the device you interact with (the remote) sets the amazon product apart from the rest. I will definitely be recommending to friends.",5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0

I decided to take my chances, local purchase it at Best Buy, and return it if it didn’t work. Whatever the issues are/were seem to be resolved. I am running the fire stick 4K off of a Verizon MiFi in an area where the signal is weak. The MiFi sometimes drops from 4G LTE to 3G and yet I have had NO ISSUES with the streaming nor have I had any issues with Direct TV Now operating as it should. In the interest of full disclosure, when the signal drops to 3G the picture is slightly grainy (like watching a VHS TAPE on a VCR) and any buffering is limited to just a few seconds, but I have realistic expectations and would expect that when the signal gets weak. If you are on the fence about buying or not buying based off of access to Directv Now I’d recommend purchasing it and at least test driving it for yourself. I’m glad I did.

The remote is sensitive and quick. However, I've never been too impressed with the Alexa feature on a TV remote--and I have 2 of them from 2 different sources. I was hoping to find a free app to get local stations and that has proved elusive so far.  Worse, the pay service I do have wants to double my subscription cost to get local stations.  Otherwise, the device works reasonably well, particularly situated about 6 feet from my router.  I got this one on sale, so not a bad deal.",3,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"The fire stick works great, does what it’s supposed to do and is easy to use. We have 2 of them and use them exclusively for the TVs. Having said that, make sure you get the app to control your fire stick because the remotes SUCK. For one thing, we have a toddler and the backs come off of these things if you breathe in their direction, which isn’t ideal with a kid who wants to eat all the things (batteries). We’ve had to duct tape the backs in place. Although, we could’ve just put the remotes in a drawer for as well as they work. Our first remote went out right after the warranty period ended, but amazon graciously sent us a replacement anyway; that replacement worked for about 2 weeks. The remote for our second fire stick worked for a couple of months before it died but we haven’t bothered to do anything about it. We just use the app, which works well enough. It’s kind of a pain in the rear, but what are you gonna do?",3,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"I have an LG OLED TV and I could not get the video and audio to sync. I tried unplugging, rebooting, and finally called customer support. After explain what I had done the service rep decided I had a defective unit and sent me another. I had exactly the same problem with the new one. I swapped the 4K Stick with an older Amazon Fire flat box type and it worked perfectly on the LG OLED TV. I then took the 4K Fire Stick and put it on another non-4K TV and it worked perfectly. I am not unhappy. I paid a fair price for the 4K Stick and the LG TV is so good that I can't see any loss of the 4K streaming quality.",3,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"The Fire TV Stick works with the apps that Amazon provides (e.g. Prime Videos) but it doesn't work at all with the SPECTRUM APP!  Apparently this has been a longstanding issue with the Spectrum App; it's an Amazon problem, not Spectrum.  This was discovered after I figured out how to finally download it as a third party app and then tried to use it.  There are many Spectrum App reviews indicating this issue.  I would not have purchased this stick if I had known.  I had no way of knowing this before I purchased the Stick (on sale). It is so incredibly frustrating!  The only thing I can use it for now is the Prime videos (and if I decide to purchase other streaming services).  Otherwise, it's a waste.  With that said, it's also a waste to set up and use Alexa because I'll only be using it for Amazon Prime Videos...waste all the way around.  I will also add that my previous DVD player that I used for Amazon Prime Videos in the past, is no longer supported by Amazon Prime.  So I was forced to buy a streaming stick...So frustrating.",2,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
My blu ray player was no longer supported by Prime. I was given a $25 discount on the fire stick 4k because of this. This was very nice but I had to end up buying a new AV receiver to accommodate the fire stick. After a week of reading the 180 page manual for the receiver I finally got the system all up and running. I am very happy with the fire stick. The picture quality is great and so far it has worked flawlessly.,5,1,2019-9-21,1,1,0

"If you have a subscription to your local cable provider, as I do with Comcast Xfinity Streaming, you're in for a disappointment. It will take you a lot of time to research online how to get third party apps on the Fire TV Stick menu because, well, they are third party, which means Amazon has no agreement with those networks. After you spend a lot of time figuring out how to get your streaming app downloaded, you may find as I did that the functionality of the app is greatly reduced to disfunctional. I could not navigate my cable company's streaming app menu at all. What a waste of time. Good news is I kept my other brand stick, which works.",1,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Bought this during black friday sale.  Used it for a few hours and decided to unplug the Fire TV stick.  The setup was easy and it was even able to control my TV and receiver volume.  However, the user interface is terrible and confusing.  It's very hard to tell what is currently selected.  The final straw was the parental control.  I wanted to prevent my kids from making purchases but don't want to restrict using free apps or watching free TV.  Even with App Launch control set to OFF, it still asks for Pin for free app, free channel or free content like CNN news.  It's very annoying and not usable at all.",3,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
I could kick myself for not buying this sooner and I will be replacing all my Roku's with Firesticks. The navigation and streaming blows both PlayStation (PS3 & PS4) and Roku away. I don't use the Alexa voice control as much as I would if I could remember it exists and is at my fingertips but it has worked flawlessly those time I have. It is especially useful for my 7 and 4 year old's who have not mastered the art of spelling. The stem that houses the HDMI plug has a great design. Its long and makes it a lot easier to plug in the back of mounted TVs where there is little space behind the tv for your hand. No complaints here whatsoever.,5,1,2019-9-10,1,1,0
"This is the 3rd generation of the Fire Stick devices I’ve owned and used and it’s the first that didn’t feel like a budget product. In the previous generations the stick versions of the FireTV were sluggish and did not feel very responsive, especially compared to the full sized version. This version is very snappy and responds immediately to the remote and the UI is buttery smooth.Speaking of the remote it’s an excellent update, gone are the days of needing to keep your tv remote nearby to control volume or power, those buttons have been added and on my 2018 Samsung TV setup was a breeze.",4,1,2019-5-30,1,0,0

I hooked up everything, set sound to Dolby Digital Plus but when I listen to Jack Ryan, season 2, it only comes in as Dolby Surround, NOT ATMOS. Very disappointing.HOWEVER- what I discovered was- when I go to watch, there is an option ""More Ways to Watch"". When I choose that I have an option for UHD.

"I managed to get everything hooked up and running - thank goodness for the extension USB cord (I only wish it were a bit longer - as it's pretty tight behind our big screen TV that's mounted to the wall above a mantle).  My only issue -- make sure you scroll down through all of the purchasing options - especially if you want to take advantage of this offer: ""Get a 1-year complimentary subscription to Food Network Kitchen on us.""  You have to actually select the Fire Stick + Food Network Kitchen option (same price as the first one) to secure that offer.  I didn't realize that -- and didn't scroll down far enough.  I clicked on the first option - just the Fire Stick. And then contacted customer service (not an easy thing to do) to ask how I can activate the subscription.  That's when I learned that I selected the wrong option.  Amazon's only solution was for me to return the device, and re-order. I've had it hooked up for several weeks (and all the packaging has long since been tossed). Seems to me there could be an easier way to resolve - but apparently not.

I have had 3 remotes go belly up and usually just wait for a sale to buy another Fire TV since the remote by itself is expensive.  It is now annoying me to have to do that.  Alexa is no help, with multiple Fire TVs, she reports all are online, when they are not all online, so it is difficult to understand which one can be controlled by Alexa and the command list has to be in front of you to make sure commands are correct - this is a hassle.

I have been able to breathe new life into my old TV and can avoid having to buy a $400 TV and just use Fire.

"It's smaller than I expected. So amazing what they can cram into tiny packages today. I wonder about it getting too hot sometimes though, so I never leave it on all day. If it really has such a powerful processor in that tiny little case that doesn't seem to have any air vents in it, how does it stay cool?  Setting it up was a bit of a mess. Not difficult, but it just looks like a tangle of cords on the back of my TV. I did my best to twistie tie it up to the base of the TV so that it wouldn't just dangle back there. I was concerned for the cord and plug in that goes to the TV with all that stuff hanging from it.  Otherwise, it works well. It's a bit weird that you can't really shut it off, only put it in sleep mode. It does seem to cool off in sleep mode though. The interface is pretty easy to use, even the advanced features. I haven't used the voice recognition nor alexa integration features yet as I don't have alexa and so many other things in the past have had a hard time understanding me in their voice controls that I've given up using voice control.  The buttons on the remote are big enough to find, even in a dark room and are plenty easy to use. Don't really need the voice control if your fingers work.  The biggest surprise to me is how many streaming services I can get on for free. It's pretty great. I'm only subscribed to Amazon Prime (natch) and BritBox. The rest of the ones I've used so far are free.  I've noticed that even more Amazon Prime content shows up on this thing than did on the interface for my WiiU back when that still worked. The main reason why I got this thing is that Amazon discontinued their support for the WiiU sometime last fall.",4,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0

"First, I am glad I read the reviews before purchasing.  I had recently bought an HDR 4K television, and after purchasing the Fire Stick 4K I found that the video was much softer than my Fire TV pendant had been, almost like it had a shade over it, and was not nearly as sharp and clear as my Fire TV.  Then I remembered reading in some of the reviews about the HDR setting, and I found the following in an online article:If you have an HDR capable television and one of the newer Fire TV models, you probably want to change the Fire TV’s Dynamic Range setting from “Always HDR” to “Adaptive.” This option can be found under the Settings > Display & Sounds > Display menu. Changing this option to adaptive will make it so the Fire TV only switches to HDR when HDR content is played.",5,1,2019-2-5,1,0,0
I like the connectivity option and its potential to use it in any worldwide locations as long as you have connections to WiFi. I dislike the fact that one has to learn how to find and then select the multiple functions and alternatives in the menus for the many Apps that one can choose.

This is my second Fire Stick 4K. I also own a regular Fire stick (non 4K). My first one has worked perfectly from the beginning. I had problems with the second Fire Stick4K from the beginning. The home button and Alexa microphone button didn't work. Following the on screen instructions in the help section didn't help because the reset section was greyed out(unable to press) I lived with it like this for a couple of weeks until one night the remote completely disconnected from the Fire stick. All I had was a grey screen with instructions to reset which I was unable to do and/or check the batteries(I did). I went back to using my regular Fire stick for a while until I could get around to contacting support for a return. Support was very helpful and responsive in walking me through resetting my Fire stick to original factory settings. When I first received my Fire stick it was already set up with my log in and wi-fi password. After the factory reset I had to input everything from scratch. Deducted one star for the hassle of it not working correctly from the beginning(not having the home button/Alexa mic functional) and for having to go through the factory reset. Overall satisfied as it works much better than the regular Fire Stick,4,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"Wasn't sure that it would be the solution to avoid paying for cable but Iit totally works for me on this level.

"I really like the speed of this device. It’s very easy to access all of my streaming apps. However, the major flaw that Amazon needs to fix is that if you pause a tv show and turn off the tv the fire stick will immediately continue to play the show you were watching. The next time you turn on Netflix you will find your show several episodes ahead and your place lost. Apparently to avoid this you have to go home or turn it on sleep mode before turning off the TV, which is hard for me to remember since I’ve never had to do it before. It also means that the device is using energy for hours after you thought you’d turned it off.",3,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0

The new stick would not work with the older set, the set on which I needed to replace the Firestick.  By switching the new stick to the newer set, all problems went away.  The control problems using the new stick with the older tv were intermittent, sometimes working, sometimes not.

"I have the original Firestick which was decent for the price. I bought the 4K unit as I added a 4K TV. I rarely write a review but this thing has frustrated me soooo much that I must. I had a horrible time loading a toggle mouse. I added an VPN which was a real struggle only to get a ""cant connect to Amazon as Im out of my service area"".  The VPN projects the server in another part of the country. That is how it works. It is a top 3 ranked VPN that I use. It is NOT one of the preloaded VPNs on the Firestick. You draw the conclusion. The Firestick once a day states it cannot find the Home Screen as its currently NOT available. I can only resolve by unplugging the power cable to reset the Firestick. Some blogs on the internet state its from the Firestick overheating. I cannot confirm as of yet.  Many of the cartoons I play for my Granddaughter the music plays but the words in the conversation are inaudible.  I have spent over 8 hours getting this Firestick to function and am truly disappointed with it.  I would not recommend.Update 8-18-2019: Firestick 4K failed this weekend. Felt hot so it probably overheated which others state is a problem.  Very disappointed in the fire stick and Amazon. Its not difficult to feel the heat in the stick when its operating.

Also having the voice option really makes things even easier and I found out u really don't need to say Alexa find this u can just say weather in where ever or live tv or period dramas and the options come right up .Definatly a great item for a not very tech savvy person like myself !!!,5,1,2019-12-22,1,2,0
"I use several Firesticks to standardize my TV's when I cut the cord with my cable company.  My TV's are different makes and models and the process for streaming content was different for each TV.  With the Firesticks, all of the TV's use the same process, making it convenient for everyone in the family.  I like that Firestick appears to keep current with most streaming apps.  It is one of the few systems that can be used with AirTV (a convenient way to integrate free over the air TV stations to my TV's via WiFi.

I don’t have a smart TV and this basically makes my TV one! The only thing I didn’t like was how big the plug part was it was hard to plug in to the outlet behind my mounted TV so I switch it with an Apple one which was smaller and it works perfectly! It was easy to install despite that and I’m seriously considering getting one for our other two TVs in the house. The picture is awesome and I love all the things you can do!

"I had Amazon fire stick for a month before it just stopped working. I read every online tutorial I could find, nothing worked. I replace chords unplugged everything, replugged, and reset, etc. I called Amazon support, but finally had to hang up because the person on the other end of the line didn't seem to know what was going on, and ultimately put me on hold. He seemed very confused about my identity, which I explained several times. He seemed more concerned with this, then with figuring out what the problem was. I bought a product, and I expected it to work. It was great while it lasted. If I get a block of time, I'll try to call support again. It's just really frustrating to spend money on something, and then have to give up all this time while someone figures out that the thing just doesn't work.",1,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0

I looked in Device Help on the Amazon website, but could not find any related post or FAQ.After doing some research on Google, I found that many people experience this issue and receive an error stating ""Mode not supported"". The fix is to hold the Reverse Key (the double left arrows button) and the Up portion of the joystick at the same time. The Fire Tv Stick should switch between resolutions about every 10 seconds. When you see the message, click the Use This Resolution box on the screen. I had to perform this procedure many time (~12) before I could see the correct resolution.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I have had many Firesticks, and they keep getting better!  We recently got a 4K LG TV that has prime video, YouTube, Hulu, etc. so I didn't think I would use the Firestick as much on this TV since you have to switch inputs and whatnot, and that is a whole extra step, lol.  I still use the Firestick ALOT, and notice that the video quality is far superior to what is produced from the TVs native apps.  All the content is in 4K, through both systems, it's just that the Firestick content, coming through the HDMI input looks better crisper and more vibrant than the content generated within the TV itself.  Pluto is NOT available on the LG tv,(which has LG channels pre-loaded, which is an (almost) suitable replacement), so I use the Firestick for the Pluto App as well.  Then there's KODI, which has always worked well on the Firestick, which is, BY FAR, the best device for running that program.  Black Friday or Prime Day are always on the horizon, or actively going on, do not hesitate to get one for every TV in your home.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
Aß for the device. It's my 1st one so I can not compare it to a different one but as for my own thoughts of the 4k it's a great device for me need. I use it for basic prime video and the Netflix accounts when I'm out of town in motels. With the crappy wifi at motels this does well. Athome even better. I jail broke this one but I'm only using my Netflix and prime accounts so I'm out of loop for info on that and for my needs it's all I'm needing. It has great picture for what I've seen. I have not experienced any problems from the device. Just from motels are the problem. I'm very happy I'd bought this very handy device. Insure it does far much more then I've thrown at it! 40bucks? How could I have gone wrong? Buy it and enjoy.,5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,1
"I like pretty much everything about it but every now and then when I turn on my TV , the fire stick displays some very bad color. I have many other devices plugged into my TV's HDMI ports but only the Fire stick had this issue. I'm guessing it's because it doesn't recognize the TV that I'm using and wether it's HDR/ non-HDR compatible .I just disconnect the power and plug it back in and everything works well but I do worry that someday it may stop working.",3,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

I don't believe that should be the case, since Netflix is covered in all countries, and depending on the network and country it's connected in, it will show only that specific country's content, but to have it all unavailable is pretty new to me!!",2,1,2019-7-23,1,0,1
Firestick is a really good entry level streaming device. I like that it also turns the tv’s on/off. Storage is a bit to small for apps that I use or movies that I like to save so I dont have to search for. All in all its very simple to set up on the tv. However it took my mom over a hour to figure out how to install certain streaming apps that she watches. The integrated Alexa is very hard to setup on a firestick. I tried for well over a hour to integrate it with my echo dot and followed the instructions and still couldnt get it to connect.,4,1,2019-10-26,1,1,0
"Bought the fire stick one year ago and it worked great.  At the one year anniversary I started receiving notification that it was not connected to the internet.  The WiFi and internet connection is now cycling between connected to WiFi and internet and disconnected.  It cycles every minute or so all day long.  I un plugged both router and Fire TV device and it still does it.  When logged into the modem I watch the Fire Stick appear and disappear from the list of connected devices; everything else on the list stays solid.  Nothing has changed, same TV, same location, same router, same router location, same house, and I haven't added anything new to the WiFi connected list.  I would buy another one right now if I knew for sure this one went bad because I really love the things it has been providing.",2,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
I had this first sick for three weeks. It worked fine and then it started making my TV malfunction. My TV started giving me error messages. I had just purchased the TV as well so I thought the TV was going bad. I then plugged the fire stick into a different TV. The error messages started coming up on the second TV. That’s when I determined that it was the fire stick and not the TV. I currently have a regular fire stick that’s not a 4K and it operates fine. Please note I was plugging it into two different 4K TVs. I had to send the unit back. I did not replace it. Whether this was just a bad fire stick or that is the nature of them I do not know. I wasn’t taking the chance.,1,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I purchased this to have capability to stream 4K content to my 4K TV.  It's working well for that purpose.The drawback is with the remote.  While the Alexis voice commands are a nice to have, the control for additional components, blueray player, audio system, cable box, etc.  My personal concern is in switching my TV's input and controlling the surround sound system.  Finding a suitable Universal Remote has been difficult as the Fire Stick is Bluetooth controlled rather than IR, so a Universal Remote needs to have the dual capability, which very few currently have.",3,1,2019-8-12,1,1,0
"I love my Alexa 4K Fire TV Stick! The only minor problem I have, and I’m pretty sure it’s because I have sucky WiFi, which I know I do, is that very fine detail in shows like clouds will come in as squiggly lines, and same with fog if there is use of fog in a show. Very fine detail seems to have trouble showing up clearly and will show up in squiggly lines. It’s not terrible by any means, it’s absolutely bearable and the picture is still true 4K. And it most likely is my WIFI. The other slight complaint which really isn’t a big deal either is that some low tones in music used in shows sound very low, almost to where you can’t hear them if you don’t have the volume up loud enough. This is for stereo sound only. You can still hear those lower tones, I just wish it would play a tad bit louder. Other than that the sound is absolutely amazing. I can’t speak for Dolby or Dolby Atmos because I’ve yet to buy a surround sound system, but I do have a sound bar and the stereo sound is amazing. Great bass, like in a movie theater! Clear voice and sound, again the only issue being lower sounds like lower sounding music or wind blowing in a show is slightly hard to bear. Other than that, this device is perfect and shouldn’t deter anyone from buying it. Absolutely love the true 4K quality picture and sound. I give my tv stick a 98% right now. If you could tweak those minor things, it’ll be 100% lol.",5,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0
"I’ve been using google Chromecast for years now and decided to try the fire stick when I needed a new streaming device for a second tv. The fire stick, by comparison, is incredibly disappointing. It functions fine in terms of streaming content, but the interface is incredibly inconvenient due to the fact that amazon tries too hard to promote their own content. The home screen is by default crowded with apps you don’t need or even want, and if, god forbid, you are using an app that amazon doesn’t benefit from, you have to jump through too many hoops to get it. HBO max, for example, isn’t available in the App Store. You need to change a host of settings in order to get the downloader app, and then find a website url online that has a download code for it and type it manually. Not user friendly. If amazon gets off their high horse and learns that people use multiple streaming services, they can possibly create a user interface that is user friendly. To sum it up, I don’t think dropping $40+ for an amazon promotional item is worth it. Skip this and stick with chromecast.",1,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"Would not work with my Haier LE22D3380 TV. Plugged it in, set it up fine, then after 5 min the screen went blank and it would not recognize the FireStick.

Called tech service, they had no clue and had me so the same unplug/plug back in routine to no avail. Returned and got a replacement since I thought it was the FireStick - same thing happened. I moved the FireStick down to an older Samsung LED tv and no issues. I’ll keep it on the Samsung, but am disappointed it wouldn’t work on the other TV.",1,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Down graded to three stars, though the stick is great to turn other devices on and the volume control it has in the past several months that I owned them disconnected from WiFi several times, the ONLY way to reconnect is to restart my router which is not that big of a deal ACCEPT I have to unplug all my 4 k sticks otherwise I chance one of them giving me the same error and not reconnecting. It states connected to WiFi but with errors!!!! Than to top it off I have the new dot 3’s with restarting WiFi one or more of my dots won’t connect and simply reconnecting does not work I have to de register the dot and go through the whole set up process several times!

"We have used the Amazon stick for several nights showing movies in our backyard. Signal strength from our wifi system was Very Good (as reported by the stick). However, more than 10 times during the movie, the Amazon Stick froze and had to be reset during the movie. In fact, the last time it said there was a problem, the Amazon stick wouldn't even respond to  the remote controller. It wouldn't take a simple ""enter"" command when a certain box on the screen was highlighted. This system is less than a month old, and it broke down in front of my neighbors. How embarrassing this was for my wife and myself, and how embarrassing it was for Amazon as well.

Worked great until it didn't.  Has recently begun rebooting itself randomly. Didn't start occurring until after the addition of a fire TV recast but not sure if the two are related. Tried a better power brick after reading that helped some people but it didn't make a difference.  Before the auto reboot issue started occurring I was already finding I needed to reboot it regularly anyway because the audio would become out of sync over time in the new YouTube app.  Given my recent purchase of the recast I am now tied to this platform so hopefully I can get an exchange or wait for a good deal on another one.,2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

"Does not integrate with HBO Max, which is replacing HBO Go and HBO Now. Be aware of this since I only just found out late last month (June 2020). Fortunately, I also have Chromecast Ultra, so that honestly saved me from having to buy something else.The audio processing on the TV stick is good, everything is dolby digital audio 5.1 (this that’s what my old receiver can decode). The processing speed is also better than the hd version of the stick and you can notice a slight improvement.

"I don't like the 4K Firestick because I have too little storage capacity left on the stick to stream movies  after AMAZON preloads lots of unwanted programs on it. Sadly Amazon blocks the user from removing these unwanted programs. Also, dissappointing is that Amazon loads two versions of the same programs like AMAZON Prime and neither version can be deleated.  Also, the new 4K Firestick doesnt't even come loaded with a Cache cleaner. At least the 1st and 2nd generation Firesticks came with an excellent Clean Master Cache cleaner. I bought one of Amazon's recommended cache cleaner, but it was totally useless and wasn't worth a dime! So far, I prefer the 1st and 2nd generation firesticks over the  two 4K Firesticks that I bought!  I love to stream videos; unfortunately, that is difficult to do with the lack of free memory space on 4k Firesticks, as movies buffer endlessly. I have an upgraded wifi plan and modem for streaming videos, but the firestick is not ready! The only reason that I gave this firestick a one rating is because zero was not an option!!",1,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I also got a bright green glow in the dark skin cover to put on it so it's easier to find when it slips under cushions, under the couch etc.  Oh and the rubber skin keeps it from sliding away as easily so it doesn't get lost as much!",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"I like the simplicity of it, and you cannot beat the deal.  We have prime, youtubetv, netflix  and disney plus for 30 dollars less than directv per month.

You can pause it and restart and it sometimes gets better but it is almost always a little to a lot off.  It didn't happen with directv using the same tv.  Drives my wife crazy, doesn't bother me so much as I am learning not to notice.  It isn't internet related because it only happens on the through the firestick.

Before getting this baby, I used to have to actually get up from my bed to turn off the TV or adjust the volume. Oh, noooo! I'm rolling my eyes because it sounds so silly and lazy. But when I'm on the verge of sleep, it's a total buzzkill to have to get up out of bed and hike the 10 feet (in the bitter cold) to the TV to turn it off.

"When I got this item, I was exited to have integration with my echo devices. All my dreams of laziness whole being under the blankets would finally come to life. Well, setup was tedious, their remote app doesn't quite work (for some reason the keyboard fails to be able to type 's' or 'r' remotely), Alexa integration was practically non-functional, and then the customer service experience was outright laughable and an example of the decaying customer-obsession tenant that characterized Amazon when I first joined.I tried going to different forums and knowledge bases to see what was wrong. The compatibility check passes for my TCL TV, I can use the remote to control my TV and if I use Alexa from the remote it can find all my devices and all. However, if I try using any echo device Alexa will fail to find such a device or it will fail to communicate with the hub. If I try controlling the volume through the Alexa App, I get a glitchy experience that finally errs by saying the device couldn't be reached. Overall it's a waste of time.",2,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0

On our 55"" LG Flat Screen TV in the family room, we were experiencing issues streaming movies from both Amazon and Netflix. The movie with either slow down or stop playing completely, and most of the time the picture would ""stutter"". After installing the Fire Stick, we once again receive beautiful quality picture and audio on the LG without any issues! It was also very easy to install, configure and start using it immediately! On the Panasonic TV in our bedroom, we experienced choppy/stuttering picture when trying to watch Netflix, and had completely lost the ability to watch Amazon Prime movies.

I can't tell it to turn the TV on to watch a certain TV station or have it change to another TV station like it says it should.

Wireless works pretty well and I have added on a wired ethernet adapter for 2 of the 3 and it is a bit of a wire jumble (defeating the simplicity of the stick), but throughput and streaming is now very consistent.

I received it but I didn't know I had because it was packaged with my desktop PC power supply. After looking at the delivery receipt it said that it had been delivered. Upon closer inspection of the box I saw two orange boxes which is what the 4K fire stick TV comes in. I was fortunate that I have a four-way outlet behind my TV and so plugging it in to power was not a problem. My Samsung TV also has four HDMI ports and so plugging in the fire stick TV was not a problem. I received an email concerning setting it up as well as other books which all said basically the same thing so getting it up and running was a snap. There are a number of videos online and in you to showing how to set up and use the fire stick.,4,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0
"I use to watch Amazon Prime from my Blu-Ray player, but was informed by Amazon that it would no longer be available from that device effective this September. They offered a $25 discount on their Fire streaming devices and I choose the 4K Fire Stick with Alexa voice control (which I don't have), to attach to my non 4K TV. I must say that set up was very easy and the device offered more options and Apps than the Blu-Ray player did. Streaming also seems a lot quicker with faster buffering and so far no annoying ""loss of network"" messages. I am pleased with this purchase and may buy another for a bedroom TV.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"I've owned version one of the firestick since it was released. This version (4K) has solved a problem I've had for some time with buffering. This was due to not enough memory for cache. I've cleaned cache out, removed unused apps and that provided some improvement. This version 3 (4K) firestick has had NO buffering issues at all since it has increased memory available compared to version 1.  I would have given this item 5 stars if I had the ability to removed unnecessary and unused subscription items such as Hulu, Netflix etc that I don't use. All in all, I recommend this highly especially if you have an earlier version.",4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I bought this to replace a first generation Fire TV stick that was getting very slow. The new Fire TV stick is a big improvement in speed and function over the old one. I like very much having the volume control, mute, and off/on buttons on the remote. I don’t have a 4k TV, but the picture quality is much better and the constant lagging is not a problem on this device. There are a couple of improvements I would suggest: add a setting to disable Alexa (I don’t use it); add the ability to change how long before it goes to sleep, it seems to sleep pretty quickly and then I have to start from the home screen again, then find the program I was watching.",4,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"I am in the process of cutting the cable cord. I  recently signed up for a newer streaming service (two weeks free to test it out). You tube TV...Lo and behold neither TV was compatible, my smart Vizio TV was too old to have the App as was my old version on Apple TV. I needed to make sure the device was compatible for You Tube TV.  I am trying to save money to get rid of a very high cable bill. Apple TV device was $149.  This Fire device is awesome!  Very easy to install and the ease of use is great.  Am so happy with my decision to switch over from cable and order the two devices to stream.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
"The product seemed to be working fine just out of the box. It is not simple to integrate with my existing hardware and software. It picked up many of my television's app right out of the box. Many other apps claimed to have been downloaded but never functioned.Now, 3 weeks out of the box, the only app usable with the Fire Stick is Amazon Prime. To use the Amazon Prime app, I have to use the television's original remote. Even with new batteries, the Fire Stick remote will only shut off my television. {Not on, not volume, not change settings} just shut off. I am returning the product.",1,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
this is the first firestick I've ever owned I was told to get the 4K and now I know why it is very fast in response to button accuracy which I love because I can't stand having a single push button remote that doesn't flow through the keys very quickly it's very annoying but this thing is very fast and responsive if you want to type something out with the single key remote it does it very quickly and efficiently and I love that I highly recommend one of these if you want to look like stream your phone to it or watch movies on firestick TV or whatever it's a great device highly recommended,5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"This thing has not worked right out of the box and I don't normally have these issues since I work in IT and can resolve most things but this fire tv fails every time to check for updates so i can't even finish setup. If I leave it on long enough it gets by that and prompts me to login  but that continually fails b/c the 2 factor authenication is wrong on amazon's end. I get the text in seconds, type it in and then it says that the code is wrong. I disabled 2 factor authentication on my account in a desperate attempt to get it to work. Still fails. Sending this junk back. I will just get a roku or apple tv.",1,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I would have given this a 5 star rating except you needed a masters degree in “remote management” to get the remote open to load batteries. Otherwise, we were happy with the product. It was easy to set up and the streaming was better than with the Roku’s we had recently purchased. We purchased 4 Roku’s in order to set up YouTube TV on 4 different TVs. However, at that time, You Tube TV was not available on the Firestick. When the Firestick became available with YouTube TV, we decided to get one since the streaming was slow or sometimes blurry with a couple of the Roku’s that were farther from our wireless router. Also, the Roku’s we purchased were not 4K and the reviews on the 4K Firestick indicated the Firestick streaming with the 4K was good. So we purchased a 4K Firestick but also connected it directly to our router via an ethernet cable. The combination of these things significantly improved the streaming performance.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,1,0
"I'm overall impressed with this, though I wasn't sure what to expect. I can push the Alexa button and say the show I want and it turns my tv on with the fire menu showing me matches. I'ts worked well with the streaming services I have, especially Amazon Prime of course, but the web browsers are terrible and you can't move within the whole screen. It also isn't easy to find apps that are even pictured in the description and on the box. I've had it show apps when searching for something else, so I watched something on it (like IMDB TV), but then it won't pull up IMDB TV to actually find something on it myself now that it exists.",4,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"In general this has worked fine to give me access to Neflix.  Last year my neighbor bought this and had a extra command device she loaned me.  It worked very easily but she had it set up and is in the condo beside us so that may have made the difference.  I had trouble setting this up with my TV...problems with the sound.  I don't know if the problem setting it up was because of the Firestick device or because of my TV.  Sometimes when I first switch over to the Netflix connection, the sound didn't work.  If I switch back to my cable connection, make sure sound is on and then switch back that seems to take care of the problem.  I didn't want to use the voice option since often my husband who doesn't watch TV much with me will yell a comment or complaint about something and then I'm yelling back at him...with the computer's voice interpreting it as some kind of command for it.  To avoid the confusion, I just try not to use vocal commands.",4,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0

"I bought the firestick 4k in order to get smart functions on my Samsung smart tv. For some reason it would lose my wifi's address unless I unplugged it. Cumbersome, right? The firestick does a great job at streaming all our services, often at 4k (unlike the samsung built-in device). Apo not available from Amazon? Sideload it! I cannot comment on the Alexa or voice recognition features as I never use them and likely never will - for privacy issues. Also, talking to robots is dumb. Feel free to disagree. Anyway, my family has been really enjoying the smart functions. Thanks for reading.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"The voice video sync gets off very often. Because my TV usb port dies not have enough voltage to run the device it remains on continuously. I found after exhaustive web search that I needed to restart the device to fix the video voice issue. It would be nice to have a power off feature on the device. One would think that this would be a most basic feature. Go figure. Video performance is ok but nothing spectacular. I have 2 other older firesticks that do not have issues with video voice sync so it seems to be inherent with the 4k stick, at least that is what I find with internet search on the matter.",3,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"This is more a commentary on follow-up services.  We were victims of a flood in May of this year. We lost everything and our house is unlivable. We're now displaced in an apartment wondering if we can rebuild. Of course we lost our Amazon fire stick but I was hopeful because we had the 3-year protection plan and it was purchased in December 2018 that it could be replaced because the only luxury item we have at this time is a television. I know this isn't a typical situation but I thought we might get some leeway. The insurance company said that unless we could return the damaged fire stick there was nothing they could do about it. I explained that nobody had any idea where the fire stick was because we lost everything in our home. It did not matter. They suggested I contact Amazon to see if they could do anything. I contacted customer service and explained the situation including what the insurance company said and Amazon customer service said there was nothing they could do about it and that I should try to contact the insurance company again. I was hoping at least an offer of a discount but that was not forthcoming. Having lost everything, purchasing a new fire stick isn't top on the priority list but it was something that we hoped to have to take a little stress off during our down times. I have always given favorable reviews of Amazon and its products but was pretty disheartening by this situation.  I know the situation does not fall neatly into a specific category or ""box"" but even Charter Spectrum (who listened when we said we lost everything) did not require return of their cable boxes when issuing us new equipment for the apartment we now stay at.  I guess my expectations were just too high for a company that Amazon contracts with for insurance.",1,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0

I have a lot of apps on it and have found no problem dowloading new apps, running out of space or buffering. It has the voice remote with  Alexa if you don't want to push buttons.  I found it very helpful  and fast when doing  a search.  I also can use the remote to turn my tv off and on now - before I had to use another remote.

Even resorted to YouTube ""how to open fire tv stick 4k remote"" to confirm that it was to be slid down using the shallow imprint and how it is difficult to open the first time.

The fire stick doesn’t seem to have this problem. It’s a super easy set up! The 4K makes the speed of the loading pretty quick. There’s no pausing either. I am addicted.

I've always used my Xbox One to access Netflix, Prime Video, etc. Not a big deal but after easily setting up my Fire stick and exploring the options. Boy was I disappointed. Disappointed that I didn't have this two years ago. I love this little device. Great selection of apps, streams easily, great entertainment options. Greatest thing to happen to TV since M*A*S*H debuted in the 70's. I posted my feelings on Facebook. More than a dozen friends claimed they've bought one since I posted my review.

(Both my phone and computer run off mobile internet which runs about 25% faster than my wifi).

You need a very very strong grip and rubber gloves to do it.  I work out with weights and felt I had to press pretty hard.

It's integrated with Alexa and heavily pushes Amazon content, so if you're all in on Amazon, you may want this.More importantly, the YouTube app is crap and they KNOW it is crap.  There is a long standing issue with voices not syncing with the picture.  There are a variety of hacky solutions to this which basically boil down to periodically clearing cache and/or reinstalling the app and rebooting the device.  This is a really insufficient solution.

Everything else was very easy and it’s easy to use.  You get a lot of apps with it besides Amazon, some free, some you have to subscribe to.

I don't know why I was surprised but this is High Def where my old ROKU was not so my picture quality is much improved.  Easy to use.  I did have one problem.  I had no problem attaching it to the tv.  Anybody could do that.  And I didn't have any problem pairing my remote.  It takes care of itself.  But in setting up...the instructions never say to push the large black button and I didn't even realize it was an operational button.  I called support.  They walked me thru it.

While it provides many services I have been unable to find a way to include local over the air stations without even more tech expensive workarounds.

The TV power button on the Fire Stick remote was very useful, as well as the volume adjustments. 3. When the Voice Recognition feature worked, it was excellent....HOWEVER...it rarely ever worked. I'm confused as to how asking for ""ROM COMS"" would load shows like ""The Unexplained with William Shatner"". (Not a random or singular experience...not by a hundred-or-so).Additionally, be prepared to have to restart your Fire Stick religiously...We've gone a few days with no issues at all, then had some days where we had to reset close to 5 or 6 times.

The original stick while still working has gotten very sluggish and slow, going through menus can get jumpy and when first turned on it takes awhile for the home screen to load in, you can see stuff popping in.  I then read how the 4k version actually is faster and has more memory. picked it up during prime day sale and wow what a huge difference! i wish i had gotten this sooner. Its so much smoother and quick vs the old firestick.  going through menus is effortless now and no more lag and clicking on the wrong thing due to lag.  If you have an old stick and are in the market, upgrade to the 4k stick even if you don't have a 4k tv, you'll thank me later.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,1,0
"I'm writing this review after several months of experience with 2 of these 4k Fire sticks. I returned the first one after a couple weeks of owning it because of the audio dropout problem. Around the holidays, I read that Amazon had updated this model and ""fixed"" the issue I was experiencing. I ordered another one for the holidays after reading that my problem had been patched.Not quite. Initially the replacement functioned perfectly. In the last month, I'm getting more and more frequent instances of audio dropout. And worse, total loss of connectivity with a message that ""Amazon Home isn't available"" or something along those lines. It's become a complete aggravation at this point as it's unpredictable when it will decide to malfunction one way or another.",3,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"Got the 4K Fire Stick during the Prime day sale after facing constant Remote pairing issues with my Roku Streaming Stick+. I have to admit that I am glad that I bought this. The performance , ease of use and overall quality is simply outstanding. The ability to add most of the Android apps is a huge plus over Roku. Would definitely recommend this stick. The only two minor suggestions I have are:- Please display the current date and time",5,1,2019-8-16,1,1,0
"This is the third Firestick I've bought and the second 4K version. My previous two (for other TVs in the house) are wonderful. The Firestick I received today is terrible. I'm having audio sync issues. The lips don't line up with the dialogue and the remote feels like it was given to 5-year-olds to assemble. (Not out of the realm of possibility, I imagine) The remote feels cheap and the select button and up, down, right, left cursor are both loose, as if they're about to fall out of the casing.I may have to send this back and check out Roku streaming options if the audio sync issue isn't fixed.",1,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0

"I've been running fire stick for a while now, LOVE IT! Saw this one and figured ""it can only get better"" I was wrong! The remote is the only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 1. The remote is AMAZING! This fire stick got rid of the ability to use the fire game controller, there are audio anomalies and random blips. I couldn't find where you can screen cast like you can with the earlier model. So... Buy the remote for $30 or this for $36 and keep your old fire stick and throw this away (that's what I did) the remote is legit though so I'm not mad. The volume button controls my stereo and the power button turns my TV on and off.

Very frustrating and no help with the tech except he credited the 1st unit to a gift card without my knowledge so that after the 3rd. Unit was returned my refund was put on a gift card even though I made my original payment on my store card. Talked to a “Customer no service” person named Barbara who said she could not transfer the cost of the unit from the gift card to my store card saying it was company policy. I then asked for her manager named Meshannda (her spelling) who was very blunt and told me if I wanted a refund I could contact Jeff Bezos cause she would not give me her manager’s name to discuss further.

"The Fire Stick works fine. The streaming algorithm for Prime is not as sophisticated as it is for Netflix. Normally, that would not matter but we have such terrible WiFi that there are times when we must switch over to Netflix to view anything because Prime cannot maintain the stream in our limited environment.

I've even removed the batteries from and put away my tv remote. I have an older model Vizio smart tv and had no issues connecting the Fire remote to it.

It loads up soo much faster, the applications are a lot more stable, we can stream from the Slingbox with no skipping and the 4K makes Netflix and other 4K enabled apps a dream.

I bought this use in my bedroom that doesn't have cable hook ups. The Fire Stick has just about everything I need. The setup was super easy and didn't long at all to complete. This picks up my wifi signal perfectly and it never freezes or hesitates. It does help that I have super fast internet from Xfinity as well. I am at the point that I may buy another Fire Stick to replace just the cable service since it's so expensive.

I thought it's the product issue, spoke to the tech person and no clue and returned 2 sticks. When I got the 3rd one, I read some reviews said it may not work on some older version of 1080p TVs.

"I'm not really into movies or TV shows so I won't comment on the stream quality and such. But I found the interface very intuitive and easily found the things I am interested in (mostly music and PBS streams). The only problem I encountered was some difficulty in getting it to connect to my Wi-Fi. I am using it for a small tabletop TV in the kitchen. This is fairly far from my router and behind a couple of walls, but my ipad and smartphone have no problems with the Wi-Fi at this location. However, Firestick kept dropping the connection after only a few seconds. I cured the problem in two ways. The first way was to use a network extender. This worked great, but my wife didn't like the extender plugged in above the kitchen counter and other nearby outlets had other ""issues"" (not realated to signal strenght). The second way was to simply use a longer HDMI cable to connect the Firestick to the TV. If you don't need a Wi-Fi extender for other reasons, this is a cheaper way to go. The downside is a having a ""black snake"" sticking out of the side of the TV. Depending on the vagaries of your Wi-Fi coverage, this may or may not be a problem. It depends on where you have to run the ""snake"" to get a usable signal. (In my case, the Firestick is currently sitting such that the line-of-sight to the router is blocked by a fridge. But it's happy. Go figure.)",4,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

The only draw back was a couple of times it didn't load as fast but that might have been my fault for leaving it plugged in for a bit so overall fantastic productPro: great content, remote, ease of setup",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"While this latest 4K version is Fantasticks and really fast, I am disappointed to see that still hosts only 8GB of internal RAM of which roughly only 5GB is usable to load apps and data/cache on.  I expected it to have been increased to 16 GB in these times of always-lowering RAM costs.  Also the lack of native integrated support for external USB storage via a OTG-Y cable ... I expected the app loader to now ask me if I wished to install on internal or USB storage but it doesn't.Otherwise, it's a great little device and very performant for very low cost.  You can't go wrong picking one or more of these.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,1,0
"The Fire TV Stick 4K is Great Media player and Streaming device. My only complaint and reason for giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is memory. In this day and age memory has gotten small and there's no reason for just 8 Gigs of memory. 500 Gigs to a Terabyte of Memory can easily be added to the fire stick with out compromising size, quality, and performance. In fact added memory would allow used access to more programing, content, games, music... Hopefully Amazon will significantly expand the memory of their products soon. Otherwise it's the best Media player and Streaming device on the market.",4,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
My son and daughter in law gave me it as a gift.  I have it on my TV in my office area and it's great to have something other than cable TV to watch.  I really like the fact I can use closed caption since I watch a lot of British TV and not sure what they are saying since they actually speak English. I remember trying to use CC on a Netflix streaming show and it was not capable.  Maybe they have improved on it since.  Very easy to hook up and get working.,5,1,2019-2-1,1,1,0
"I never had any trouble with my first fire stick.  I decided it was time to upgrade, and get the newer version after having my original one for several years now.  The remote had been lost / found many times and was pretty beat up, but still worked great.  I received the 4K fire stick and set it up.  Long story short... I’ve had nothing but problems with it.  I’ve been very disappointed!  I’ve had trouble getting it to just come on, like today, which is part of the reason for this review.  Also, it won’t work with the Disney+ app for the kids.  I have a friend who recently got the 4K fire stick, who’d never had one, he says the Disney+ app work fine on his.  I wish I still had the old fire stick, and really wish I could just return the new one.  I think I may go and check on that.  Good luck folks!",1,1,2020-2-1,1,1,0
"The Firestick works as good as the Roku it is replacing.  However, in addition to the streaming services such as Netflix, Prime, Hulu, etc the device allows me to access the Internet.  Accessing the Internet permits additional streaming sights that are not offered through the available devices.  The device is many times faster then the Roku, but the Roku was old, model 2, which could account for the speed difference.  This was purchased during a sale so it very worth the cost.  It will integrate with our Echo Dot but as with a such devices voice recognition is a challenge.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Cut the cable cord in January, using the 4K firestick & the optional Ethernet adaptor.  We've been listening to YV broadcasts through our Bose surround sound speakers connected to our Yamaha AV receiver for many years. TV without surround sound is just TV.  My challenge was to get the sound out of the TV, now being controlled by the 4K firestick rather than the HDMI/cable input.  Rather than plug the firestick into the TV, I plugged it into the HDMI input port on the AV receiver.  Now we have the surround sound without cable & with all of the streaming options available. Works like a charm. Every TV in our house is connected and we're saving money each month. AND watching all the shows we want to watch.",4,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0

My earlier version of Fire Stick had no buffering problems.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
Set up was so easy. It recognized my older tv and the remote works well with it. It's great having all of your streaming apps in one place!

"We had always accessed Netflix and Prime Video through our Blueray player when we received a notice from Amazon that they would no longer support such access. The simplest solution for us was to purchase a Fire TV Stick 4K. We seriously thought about purchasing a smart TV, but decided to try the Fire TV Stick first. Good news, it works and works well. Yes, we will eventually purchase a smart TV, but not now.",5,1,2019-8-17,1,1,0
"I was forced into finding a new streaming option when first Amazon and then Netflix stopped supporting streaming on Sony Blu Ray Home Theater systems.  Boo!  It's much easier to use than the laptop-hooked-to-TV solution that I had been limping along with. I especially like the blue tooth remote control, which does not require a line-of-site to the unit to work.  (My Sony system's remote was a real pain in this regard.)  One of these days I'll figure out how to reorder the apps list so that it more to my liking, but I just haven't taken the time to do that yet.Bottom line:  Works great.  Price is right.  Look for discount codes, because I got mine for half price.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

Tried everything and learned lots of others have same problem.  Occasionally it will connect to Home directly but most of the time I have to unplug from power and re-energize to get stick 4k to start. ( I have another stick on a samsung with same problem.)I also find that the stick 4k will not connect to Home and I have to unplug/plug my router or even the modem to get the stick 4k to connect.

"First, I don't have a 4k TV.  It worked well though on my 55"" hi-def flat screen.  Very easy to hook up.  Good to go after entering your WIFI password since the unit was recognized by Amazon, meaning there was one less password to enter.  The remote worked the fire stick w/o issues, and I liked the fact it could turn the TV on and off as well as adjust the volume.  The fast forward functionality was much better than what I previously had with a previous streaming device too.  The signal strength also seems stronger than what I had with my previous streaming device.  That said, I may be getting some interference somewhere from time to time and would love to get a hard-line connection for the unit to always get the strongest possible signal.  Overall, I'm very pleased.",5,1,2018-11-15,1,0,0

"Just unboxed my Fire TV Stick 4K yesterday. Installed it according to instructions...all I got was the Fire logo stuck on the screen...and a chime every 10 seconds. Thought I was doing something wrong, so I looked up troubleshooting on line. Tried plugging in the HDMI extender, plugging it into different HDMI ports, tried it on a different TV, reset the remote, reset the Fire Stick, just couldn't get past the logo screen ever! Finally contacted Amazon Technical Services and they told me that the new Stick I received must be defective. I spent two hours trying to get it to work. Now I need to get a replacement or lose my money. Looking online I've found that a lot of customers are having the same behavior with the 4K fire stick: the device gets stuck at boot and you end up with a non-responsive Fire tv logo on screen.",1,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"After having a disappointing experience with a Roku machine, I purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick in the hopes that it would deliver the same quality that I have come to expect from Amazon.  I was very wrong in my expectations.  This device overheats on a regular basis and the manufacturer's suggestions on how to correct this issue are not helpful at all.  I had to replace the item and the second one was slightly better, but eventually started crashing and not loading channels, just like the initial device.  I was so very disappointed that Amazon would create such poor quality.",1,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I just purchased a new smart TV.  Really easy to install Fire stick, basically plug and play in HDMI port with auto setup.  The remote is very convenient as it has the audio feature where you can ask Alexa to launch apps, find movies, etc.  Discovered after I purchased this that I could have probably just used google play talk on my new TV.  I have an Echo already that’s what prompted me to get the new Fire Stick.  Now that I am cable free, YEA, I can always switch it to another TV in the house.  Love the Firestick!",5,1,2019-2-17,1,1,0

It is so smooth and the streaming is great (I do have a decent internet speed though so it could be a different experience if you don't). Definitely worth upgrading if you're thinking about it. And the new remote is awesome as it can power on your tv and there is volume control and mute functions. It finds your tv for you, no need to find a code or anything.

Now the new one, Fisrestick4, works fine, except for only major problem, NO SOUND.Today I spent an hour on what was assumed Amazon help, only to have my acount hacked, $575 deducted from my bank account, and now a myriad of emails to rectify the fraud charges, and yes, still no sound.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0

Unfortunately, the Fire TV Stick 4K has the same problem as my Bluray player with the Amazon app.  Another problem is that it will lose the Internet even though the cable/modem router is only 3 meters away.  None of the other devices using the same router have an Internet problem.  On the plus side, the picture quality and sound are excellent using my home theater system.",3,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0

The only complaint is the lack of compatibility with my universal remote.  It would be nice if the universal remote could control the Fire Stick, so I wouldn’t have to juggle remotes, but that’s a minor issue.  A family member was just referred, by our leading local electronics dealer, to another streaming product for that very reason.

I tried the fire TV cube and didn't like it. I like the 4k stick and a stand alone echo better. The voice remote works great and it controls the power and volume on the TV! I plan on using this stick on all my TVs. Even in the car on my overhead TV screen! I haven't tried the 4k feature because most of my programming is just HD. I highly recommend this TV streaming device!",5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0

If you do not want to click,  you can tell Alexa what you want and she does it. My co-worker also has a firestick. I have been trying to convince her to cut cable for years. She finally did so earlier this year. She raved on and on about the firestick so I decided to try it.  I'm glad I did. I plan to purchase another for my daughter's room.",4,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

We continue to have problems with freezing, locking up, and dropping all signal.  I think it is better on the 4K units, but even those lock up on Good Morning America and the Evening National News (mostly NBC).  We have changed the router to a WiFi 6 unit, we have plenty of bandwidth (100 Mbps or more), we have had Comcast out to check our signal strength at the outlet (which was a  contributing problem), but we are still unsatisfied with our situation.

"We dont really use Alexa to much so no comment there. Besides that, me and my family absolutely love the firestick. We elected out of buying Cable TV and instead use the firestick in all our rooms. This 4k firestick is a huge upgrade from the original(which I still own like 3 of). The streaming quality is excellent. There is alot more storage space for apps, movies, tv, ect... I highly recommend this for anyone who seeks a high quality streaming device at a good affordable price!! The remote control that comes with it is updated to include volume buttons, a mute button, and can even power your TV on and off, so you only have to use one remote!! That was a BIG addon that makes the firestick even better! Also it does come with an extension piece that I assume is for wall mounted TV's.In summary, I have no complaints about this wonderful product. Amazon has once again blew me away with another awesome and amazing service that they offer.

I have no problem with HDCP issues like I had with Roku. BUT, Amazon overwhelms you with amazon products with limited app choices outside their product line. There are several apps I can't get or have to go thru an extensive processes to get. Maybe I should have upgraded my Roku instead of trying Firestick. I guess I was unhappy with Roku since it was their product that was defective. All-in-all Firestick 4k is ok but I really miss the easy Roku Interface.",2,1,2019-7-4,1,1,0

A couple time an hour the signal will drop and you'll get that buffering circle going around.  This is the fire stick, not anything else.  Wifi signal is strong.  I did have an Apple TV in this same spot, it NEVER buffered.  I moved it to another room wanting to use the Fire stick in the main family room where Alexa is, but it's a pain to have to deal with these single drops.

"The mini USB port is not a true USB port. It only is used to power the device.  You cannot use control devices such as FLIRC to send IR commands like you could in the previous models.  Also, Fire TV Stick 4K doesn't receive any IP commands making it impossible to be controlled by a single remote.Not sure why they took this approach.  When more and more audio and video equipment are going IP control using iOS or Android applications as a centralized remote - Amazon is going with a solution that requires every TV to have its own remote.",2,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

"I use this with a Fire Recast box, and the biggest plus is that there is no monthly fee like Tivo or subscriber services.  It's really good with any of the apps (Netflix, Prime, ESPN, Disney, etc.).  It is a little slow to react sometimes (we're only talking fractions, or a second) so the response is not quite as immediate as others.  Live, Over The Air (OTA) and streaming services are great, although every once and awhile it will have a slight break (not sure if this is a Firestick issue, or my internet service (I just switched providers, so I'm watching this closely).  When using the Recast and playing back recorded shows, there are definitely some cons.  Frequently there is a voice sync problem with audio lagging noticeably.  There are also times (very infrequently, but none the less really irritating when it happens) when the show will lock up, or, go black entirely).  Still, I am happy that I made the switch.  One irritating feature (bug?) is that if you pause a recorded show for a few minutes, the screen goes completely black (no bouncing screensaver or anything - just black screen).  The result is that when you come back later, you may forget that it's paused, and hit the power button thinking it's off.  Then you end up having to restart the TV and start over again to get back to where you were.  Takes a little getting used to, but worth it.",4,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"It works great at what it does. High pictures quality, sound as good as anything else coming from my mediocre TV, low lag, and quick start up. It understands my voice even when my nose is stuffed up or I'm mangling the pronunciation of foreign words.The real disappointment is how poorly it is integrated into the Alexa ecosystem. For example, it can turn on the TV by voice but not turn it off. You can get it to automatically start playing the first episode of a number of shows but there's no way to start at season 22, episode 1 by voice. The most confusing/frustrating part is that there is inconsistent behavior between controlling it with my echo or the alexa app on my phone vs using the button on the remote. It just boggles the mind that this isn't more clearly unified.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

I have even paused the show and pressed the back button before turning it off or going to something else and it still doesn't remember my place. Alexa only knows how to function in amazon apps. If I'm in Hulu and ask her to find a show, she will search for it on amazon prime. Completely useless.

Once again Amazon does it again. After having the original fire stick I thought that was the best bang for your buck device but this 4k stick might seem very different but it is. I got this during prime day which I bought two for the price of one which is amazing and the performance you can tell as faster you can tell that it has a little quicker iOS system and a little more honestly a little more storage because there's less bloatware on the fire stick.

"I love the fire stick for the movies and shows it offers, however, after a few months of being plugged into my tv's hdmi channel, it started losing its stability due to gravity. gravity won again. anyway, now, I've got cords and tape wrapping the fire stick into the hdmi - amazon needs to make it more stable on the interior, as it becomes hard on the little stick to stay strong when it's being pulled on by the electrical cord at the bottom of the TV. just needs more weight to it to remain intact. no one should have to jack up their tv with cords and duct tape to watch a show.",3,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"Amazon has done a great job with the FireTV platform and the Fire Stick 4k. It's easy to use and the video quality is great. This stick is my go-to for smart TV features now. It's used daily, sometimes for most of the day as we binge watch seasons of shows while house cleaning and doing laundry. It rarely freezes up or has any issues.PROS - handles almost any stream I throw at it. Netflix, PLEX, HBO Go, Disney+, AppleTV. You name it, you can get it.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"We’ve had this about 10 days and we just figured out how to use Alexa. However as we haven’t used it enough it really isn’t fair to rate it but they asked and I did. HOWEVER we woke up this morning and the internet connection was lost.  We find it annoying that we have to reboot and reconnect with a product this soon after getting it.  In the three or four years that I steamed Prine and Netflix through my old Sony Blue Ray player I don’t recall having to reboot for them.If you’re going to basically force your product on us, it better function at 100% for at least a couple of years",2,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I got this because my old Blueray started cutting back on the apps it supported.  We were thrilled to see that the Fire Stick has a ton of free content.  We haven't had cable in 4 years and only use Netflix and Amazon Prime.  This Fire Stick gave us so much more content for free on top of our existing paid services.  I also love that the remote will control my TV, so I no longer have a universal remote that needs to be toggled between TV and Blueray any time you want to change the volume or channel.  This was such a great purchase and I really wish I had done it much sooner.  It's worth the price!",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
We recently (as in the last 3-4 months) made the jump from cable t.v. to streaming as for the reason most people do: cable t.v. costs too much. We purchased the Firestick 4K (which was recommended to us to buy if we were going to invest in this).PROS:,4,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"We've had nothing but problems with this since we bought it.  Extremely frustrating because we use it with the TV Recast by Amazon and it is continually losing network connection.  Just watching one TV show it can easily lose connection two or three times.  So frustrating!  We've searched and searched online and discovered that many people have this same problem.  So we tried all of the solutions suggested.  Finally, after eleven months of frustration I called their customer support and their only suggested solution was to send me a new one and have me return the old one.  Of course, this did not solve the issue.  My son came for Christmas, however, and suggested the Amazon Ethernet Adapter for Amazon Fire TV Devices.  He bought it for us and installed it and the issue is now completely resolved.  Why didn't Amazon tech support suggest this?  Anyway, for those struggling with Network Connection issues with the fire stick, this is a quick and inexpensive solution to the problem.",2,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I had the previous generation Firestick but was experiencing a lot of buffering. I upgraded to the 4K version to address that issue. Assuming the extra memory would be the quick fix. I was wrong! Although on some streams the buffering is less, across the board it still rears it's ugly head. I don't know why they don't simply increase the amount of memory or at the very least provide an easy way to eliminate the bloat ware that is ever present on new devices.  My next option is to try and add a memory stick to the device to enhance the memory available. I will update this review in a few days.",4,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0

"Needed to replace our fire TV and chose the 4k stick this time around (fire TV quit sending audio output to the soundbar - got a good 2 years out of it though). My con to EVERY Amazon streaming device we have had (this is 3 out of 3) is the unstable streaming of the Hulu app: Hulu must be restarted several times a day. Why do I say this is a Amazon issue? We have a Samsung 4K TV (55in I believe) and previously a Panasonic plasma TV. The issue occured regardless of Amazon device (2 separate fire TV devices, and now the newest fire TV stick 4K) used on 2 separate TVs (one of which is a smart TV). The Hulu app works PERFECTLY fine when streaming directly from the smart TV, with only 1 instance of needing to reinstall the app (after an update). The Hulu app, when streaming from the 4K fire TV stick, crashes at least once a day and even though we properly exit the app each time we are finished, it gets hung up in Amazon, requiring a force stop of the app to reopen the app the next time we attempt to stream the app. It's frustrating. I think Amazon and Hulu need to get together to address the issue. Mind you, no other apps have this problem.",4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
I upgraded my fire stick recently. I would have upgraded a lot sooner had I known about the awesome volume control. I lost the regular remote to my TV so I have been turning the volume up and down manually. (First world problems) So I was super excited to see this one had volume control and it was easy to set up. My son did it while I was at work. Very satisfied with this purchase.,5,1,2019-9-19,1,1,0
"the quality and voice recognition is great, but the biggest and most surprising part, was that it integrated all our remotes. we had 4 remotes that had to be used to, turn on the tv, turn on the sound-bar, use the tv remote to switch to HDMI 2, then use the remote to pick our streaming preference and so forth. but the Alexa remote can do all them . the one remote turns on the tv, turns on the fire tv, and turns on the sound bar, and the same remote is used to scroll and choose our favorite streaming apps. its amazing! we are blown away, and its ALL so easy and simple to use.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

Was just about ready to purchase another blu-ray player one when a family member sent me the Fire Stick.  Plugged it directly into my TV HDMI port and the thing is lighting FAST !

"My old fire stick was annoying me because it was just so slow and tedious to navigate through anything, so I took advantage of a current sale to get the Fire Stick 4k for $25. Massive upgrade as far as speed and navigation is concerned. If you have an older Fire Stick, it's definitely worth the upgrade. I can't compare to the newer non 4k sticks as I don't have one, but realistically you should probably just get the 4k if you're planning to get a 4k tv at any point in the next few years anyway since the price difference isn't that great especially with frequent sales.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Used on an older model 1080 plasma.  Purchased as an inexpensive upgrade to old AppleTV enabling full controls on Hulu. Definitely worth the purchase.

I have not used it enough to say it's me or it.",5,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
Got this on a screaming deal! Works beautifully on my television set in my bedroom. All offerings are solid. Only thing I wish it had was a timer setting on the remote and software. I have to hunt down the television remote and said that one instead. It would be nice to just work off of one remote. But that seems like a silly thing to complain about… This is an awesome product.,5,1,2019-10-20,1,1,0
I love the fire stick in many ways but here’s the critical hitch… Most of the TV providers streaming apps will not work on the fire stick. This is critical because while all of us like to watch Netflix and Amazon prime and other streaming content… What we absolutely have to have is the local channels.  These channels are typically offered in streaming app form from your Internet/cable provider. Therefore it is critical that your provider app will run on the fire stick. My TV provider is Spectrum. The spectrum app is compatible with Roku.  The app is also compatible with  Apple TV. It is NOT compatible with the Amazon fire stick.I also noted that another reviewer said he could not get the DIRECTV streaming app to work through the fire stick. So that’s two of the majors that don’t work with the fire stick. I have yet to try it with Comcast’s streaming app.Hey!...Amazon you’ve got to work with these cable providers and support their app just as they need to work with you to ensure compatibility. Without compatibility with the provider app the value of the fire stick is greatly diminished.,2,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
"I bought a fire stick in 2017, did me well until recently, a lot of buffering, ""no network connection"" issues and Amazon Home screen getting stuck on.  I thought it was the Philo app, so did some research. Suggestions were to try the 4K fire stick. Just got this on the 14th. So far no more issues of the sort. Crossing fingers this was the right purchase to eliminate the problems I was experiencing. I'll update review if needed.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0
"I have had my Firestick for 13 months and now it has completely quit working.  Sadly, the warranty on  my Firestick is a, ""One Year Limited Warranty.""  One would think that a company as huge and rich as Amazon could afford to provide a more complete warranty and one that would provide protection for a little longer than one year.  Of course, as is typical of my luck, I had the very day the Firestick died, rented a movie on Prime.  So now, I am also screwed out of $4 for a rented movie that I cannot watch.  I don't want to give the Firestick a bad rating because, before it died, it provided great service.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"I purchased this to replace an older Fire Stick.  There was nothing wrong with my older Fire Stick, but this new one is faster in every way.I mostly used my Fire Stick to view Ring cameras around my house on my TV.  I figured the Fire Stick 4K might do that faster.  Unfortunately, shortly after I purchased it, Amazon disabled the ability to view Ring cameras with an Echo Dot and a Fire Stick, so now I have no use for it.  I use a Roku Ultra for streaming, so I just wasted money on a 4K, because Amazon decided to disable the feature I purchased it for.",3,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I just made the switch for Google Home and Roku to the Echo Dot and Fire Stick, at first I was extremely impressed, you can do far more with voice control which was my top priority, but I've only had the fire stick for 2 days and I already have issues with it. My first day I was able to tell echo to play next episode when I was at the end of an episode, now it's saying it's not supported. I love that I'm able fast forward and rewind by voice command, but it only works for about an hour and then it's like my echo can't connect with the first, I'll give a command, the light on the echo will come on, but it doesn't do what I asked and doesn't respond, so I have to reboot the fire stick and then the echo can control it again for about an hour, that is so disappointing. I also hate that if I pause the fire stick to leave the room, after a few minutes the screen goes black, no buttons will work, I have to turn the tv off and back on, then it shows the home screen for the fire stick. The fire stick has so many issues, I hope they can fix them because when it's working properly this device is amazing, but I'm debating on keeping it, because right now it malfunctions more than it works.",2,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0

"The Fire TV Stick 4K is the latest version with many improvements and works on older TV's with HDMI ports, I do not have USB ports(plug it into the wall outlet instead, has more power, better than USB) The remote is perfect with volume controls & Alex voice, everything works fast and flawless. Quick & EZ to install, there is a short extender cable for the fire stick so you can connect the stick in tight or angled HDMI ports. Use the extender because it is a Wi-Fi booster also. You can check your Wi-Fi signal on your TV once you are set-up, mine shows fair( It's 70ft away). Everything works perfectly movies, flipping through programs, downloading Netflix app(2-3min),etc. My internet speed is 6mbs and Fire TV streams perfectly in 1080p. When watching a movie I can not ask Alex to back up, I must use the remote buttons to do it. You need a newer TV with a HDMI 2.2 port to plug the fire stick into.

"The device itself works great and I highly recommend it, but the remote backing of this version is terrible. I had one of the first versions of the Fire TV and the remote itself felt almost velvety and it had the typical clip/snap backing. This one feels like much cheaper plastic and slides open and shut  instead of clicking into place, so it slides off all the time with zero effort, even when I don't mean it to. Especially with kids, that backing has fallen off and disappeared so many times I can't keep count. I wish they'd bring back the old version of the remote.",4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0

Example - When I manually Search from the Home screen I can start selecting letters, using the control and eventually pull up the query “Mystery Movies on Prime” and it provides a scrollable selection.If I asl Alexa  “Mystery Movies on Prime” it gives me ""Movies and TV"", along with selections from services I don’t even have.

Anyway, I was hoping this new fire stick and remote would work and save me from having to buy a new tv or purchasing a universal remote and trying to figure out the right sequence and numbers to put in it. ...IT DID!

This device is your key to enter into world of digital content if you know how to deal with it and or get some help with initial setup. There’s literally no words to define the potential of this device got. What can one expect from this $40 investment which can make your tv smart (If not already) instead of breaking on your saving to buy a new tv which is going to be crap in few years again which new technology everyday. The picture quality is amazing and you can get 4k UHD streaming as long as your tv supports that. Very important to know your tv doesn’t have to be smart or 4k tv in order for you to use this device. There are so many other apps you can install and watch trillions of new content. I am sold on this and truly love my fire tv 4k.,5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,1
"I have been having a lot of connection issues with my fire sticks. A long time roku fan I tried a fire stick on prime day for the first time, I would not pay full price for these. The speed and interface of the fire stick impressed me so much I got rid of all my Rokus and changed to fire sticks. Well the internet connection issues with the devices are real annoying. I had two rokus and a Xbox that are in the same places as the fire sticks are now with never any connection issues. It’s fustrating and disappointing to believe in a product but to find one big flaw.",2,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"This streaming service is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !!!  I must say that this is one ☝️ of the best purchases ever !  I’m really thinking about eliminating one of my cable boxes & replacing it with another Firestick 4K !  I previously had a Roku, but it decided to stop working for no apparent reason !  The Firestick knocks the Roku straight out of the ballpark !!!",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
Love having out Firestick along with us on our Hawaii vacation. Turned usually spotty horrid TV reception into a wonderful time unwinding after a fun-filled day in the sunshine!! I will warn buyers that MOST hotels/motels have now outfitted their in-room TVs so that you can't attach your Firestick to their televisions. This is NOTHING on Amazon or Firestick!! Just a head's up about horrid hotel/motel chains who must think anyone staying at their venue is wealthy & can afford those $20 online movie rentals. Thank  you Amazon for the easily portable Firestick!!,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"The only reason I purchased this item was so I could watch HBO Max on my ""smart"" TV. due to exclusive deals, there is no app for my TV. So i decided to get the Fire Stick... Only then realizing that Amazon has also blocked the App.HOWEVER, You are able to side-load the HBO Max app. that alone is the only reason for the 4 stars.",4,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"We don’t have cable so decided to get the Fire TV. It’s awesome and runs the Hulu and Netflix apps for us which saves a bunch of money.I wanted to order a second one for our living room, but unfortunately all they had were the Fire STICKS available, so I got one thinking it’s basicaly the same thing. It’s not. The apps are constantly inturrupted, Hulu loses its connection every few minutes when watching anything on Live tv, dvd or on demand, and you have to restart the entire device in order to get back in and get it working again. Netflix does this occasionally as well but not as frequent or consistently as Hulu. I’ve seen similar reviews after trying to troubleshoot online. Seems there’s no fix. It’s not the internet connection because I can log in on my laptop on the same WiFi network and have zero interruptions. Very disappointed.",2,1,2019-2-27,1,0,0
"I needed a replacement for the built-in Roku device on one of my TV's that has been acting up and getting progressively worse.I've used previous versions of Firestick and they were so slow and miserable to use, so I was hesitant to buy this.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"I have three of the previous generation  Sticks on my various TV's.  I needed one more and decided to try the latest generation.  Since I installed the same apps on the new Stick as on the old ones, I noticed that the installation time was noticeably faster.  I also used the FTP Server functionality of ES File Explorer to transfer the apps to the Stick from my laptop.  The wireless transfer rate also seemed noticeably faster than the previous generation.  The volume control and on/off switch are welcome additions.In summary, I am very pleased with this latest generation Fire TV Stick.  Everything seems to work as well or better than the previous generation.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"Update August 2020: Decided to remove one of our cable boxes and replace it with another Fire TV stick; to avoid paying the monthly cable fee. I really enjoy my Amazon Prime membership with all its benefits (Prime TV, Kindle Books, Prime Music, Free Delivery).We gifted ourselves a 4K TV this holiday season and purchased the Fire TV Stick 4K as a complement. We enjoy Amazon Prime video as our primary source of TV entertainment; the Fire TV Stick 4K provides a simple and convenient interface for navigating the streaming options. I use the voice recognition capability infrequently; inclusion of volume function on the new remote control is a great advantage over the prior version.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
I am very disappointed because I purchased this with the intention of downloading the Spectrum TV app and there is no way to download this app it’s not compatible the fire TV stick is not working with this app I am very disappointed with this product. I’m been trying slowly step-by-step different ways to have this app to work but it’s no way I already read reviews that they mention the same issue the same issue for my bad luck I find out about this fire stick not working with spectrum after I purchase six more fire sticks at this point I really want to return all the fire tv sticks that they still in the boxes not even touch and get a refund. I am hoping that Amazon will agree to give me a refund on all the fire stick TVs that I have left or to exchange it for something else get or getting a credit on my account.

"I must say that I have grown so frustrated with this Fire Stick that I have decided to shop for A Roku. What I really dislike is that the device tries to control my television as opposed to being a device that I control and it angers me when I forget to unplug it and it remains on despite the television being turned off. In fact, I hate even more when it turns on the tv on its own. I am sure privacy and data issues are involved since it contains an Alexa, although I have never activated it, but it's just not worth it. I recently left town but forgot to unplug the Fire Stick and when I returned a week later the television was running. I've read all of the troubleshooting materials and user reviews, I have changed batteries several times, etc., but nothing works. I have an older Fire Stick on my other tv and have no complaints with it, but have lost my patience with this 4k device.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

"This is our third firestick and 2nd 4K so we knew exactly what we were getting.  We dont have any smart TVs so the firesticks help us access a world of streaming programming that wouldn't otherwise be available to us.I wanted to work out to YouTube videos on a different TV than the one where we currently have a 4K installed. To me, the cost of the second 4K and the YouTube Premium subscription is a tremendous bargain for all of the workout options, even if I never used the firestick for anything else.",5,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
"Buyer Beware! NOT COMPATIBLE with a Laptop - I wish it was.Even if your Laptop has an HDMI Port, like mine does, it won't work.

After the 2nd night- had to call again to move it to another account- only to find out the Firestick 4K didn't do the NHL.TV app- but- all the lesser ones do. Getting a ROKU.

"It was a great investment. I had a non-smart tv. I have tried Chromecast before, but I honestly don't like to mirror my phone. I had to download an app on my phone and have it with me. Now, I turn my TV on and off with the fire tv remote, I use Netflix, amazon prime, HBO, Youtube very easily.Installation was very easy: just stick it to the USB entry, follow instructions that appear on your monitor. I have been using for 2 weeks now and had absolutely any problem.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,1,0
"I would give it as 5 star as it is working SO much better than the earlier models, but I have a problem with high definition video, from Prime and Netflix, showing on the screen while I am mirroring from my Android cell phone. Guess it is actually a handheld PC with a phone app on it. Anyway it shows the text that normally shows in the foreground, and plays  the audio, through the fire stick, but there is no video showing. I tried tech support but they are down for the pandemic, and refer you to frequently asked questions or forum, and nothing there adequately answers the issue. I might upgrade this review if, and when, I ever get to mirror video correctly.",4,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
One thing that isn't explained when connecting the fire stick 4k up is that if your tv has HDR functionality then you MUST change the color depth in the settings. The fire stick comes pre-set at 8-bit color. If your TV support HDR-10 or 10+ then you must switch it to 10 bit color depth. If your TV has DOLBY VISION then you must use 12 bit color depth. This will allow you to see the full 4k uhd experience.,5,1,2019-8-3,1,1,0
This 4K fire stick in my opinion is Amazon’s best streaming device to date. The new stick is super fast with virtually no lag ever and lets me watch shows in stunning 4K with HDR. The new remote is absolutely genius I love being able to turn both my TV and sound bar on with one remote and control the volume on my sound bar without having to get up and switch remotes. I love this device so much that I bought my mother and cousin both one of these and the price at only 50 bucks ( 35 at the time I bought mine) is a steal for the quality and convenience that this device will bring into your everyday life. If you’ve been looking for a cheap convenient way to watch TV then look no further than the Amazon Fire Stick 4K.,5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0
"Since I have a Prime Account, set up was simple. Maybe a bit too simple. A little disconcerting that AMazon has enough of my information to program Stick. Alexa voice recognition is fun. Operates all my lights, other devices. Very responsive on TV. One HUGE problem. I thought it would eliminate a remote. Nope. You need the original TV remote to switch back to cable/dish or whatever you have. A real nuisance. Would love to back out of Stick, hit cable button on cable remote and be good to go. So, I've actually gone from 2 to 3 remotes. Not very convenient. Amazon-please do something about this.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"Just want to give a heads up to anyone thinking of trading in their old firestick for an upgraded firestick with Amazon promising you a 20%discount for the upgrade.  Its a scam on Amazon's part.  I followed Amazon's instructions for the upgrade deal, printed out the address and enclosed the form with our first generation firestick which was still working when I sent it to Amazon.  Then I get an email that they won't accept it as part of the upgrade program and they've issued a .99cent credit for it!  I contacted customer service and they claimed the stick didn't work and was defective which is why they couldn't honor the trade-in deal.  Well, it was working when I put it in the mail to them and there was nothing in the trade in deal instructions which suggested that they would reject it.  Had I know that was a possibility I never would have sent it to them.  When I explained this to the customer service, their rep said she could give me a 15% discount toward a new firestick, which is close to their original deal so I thought, OK, fair enough.  But when I went to purchase the upgraded firestick the next day there was no indication of the discount in my account or during check out.  Now I've had to pay full price for a new firestick and I lost my old firestick, which I could have used on my upstairs TV.  Needless to say I am angry -- Amazon did not honor its trade-in deal.",1,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"If you have any photos uploaded to Amazon Photos, the fire stick logs in and displays them automatically. You can turn that feature off but anyone who comes into your house can turn it back on without a password. Unbelievable.Why does this have so many good reviews?

I'm getting rid of it and I'm getting a new Roku even if it's five times as much, I cannot believe how much I hate this garbage",1,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
Used Samsung TV to initialize Fire stick as refused to connect to LG Smart TV. Tried several options to reset the device but nothing worked until I found Settings => Equipment Control => Manage Equipment => TV => Change TV ==>> by manually going through every single setting in Settings. Fire Stick Help sections did not mention this setting and the change device information was not accurate to my issue.

"I liked how the device is neatly tucked behind my receiver and out of site. The UX is not as polished as Apple TV’s but it’s functional and not a deal breaker. Apple’s remote is pretty slick but honestly I don’t like how easy it is to accidentally press something, the fire TV remote has physical buttons and I love that I can leave it anywhere on my bed and not have to worry about accidentally closing my stream and then having to go crazy looking for it after. It also powers up my TV and receiver with one push of a button so that’s awesome. There’s tons of great quality material to watch, more than I’ll ever need. But the best thing I like about my fire stick is that there are available browser apps. Using airplay from my iOS device isn’t very reliable and I don’t really enjoy fiddling with things more than I need to.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,1,0

The streaming quality is good as well.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0
What I like is that for the price it does everything better than Roku and AppleTV and I even took back the two brand new Apple TVs I purchased because they are way overpriced for what they do and this device is much better. What I don’t like is that it doesn’t work so well one it’s on voice view which is something I desperately need because I have very low vision and it also has issues with Alexa commands from time to time for things that you would  expected to behave just like an Echo Dot.,4,1,2019-8-22,1,1,0
"I purchased the 4K because I noticed it when I went to replace our Firestick with remote, and Alexa voice control, but wasn’t 4K.  The Firestick device I purchased last year, literally ate batteries every two weeks.  It startedneeding battery replacement after about 5-6 months.  The new 4K Firestick is so far, working as it should and much faster than the preceeding Generation.  That said, it took a few months before the last Fstick started flubbing up and eating, which I read is a common problem with original voice remote Alexa integrated Fsticks.  So far, so good and have only had it it a little over a week.  Hopefully, Amazin worked out the kinks on the latest device.",5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
"I was given a fireTV stick and after a couple weeks, it kept giving me a temperature picture or just kept restarting. I found out it was constantly hot. I ordered this FireTV Stick 4K because I had read that they don't tend to overheat as much. About the one that I got - First: I got it 1 to 2 days earlier than expected. Second: I happen to like watching/listening to the tv while doing other things, in this case, I was rearranging a room. While I was rearranging between one thing and another the entertainment area was unplugged a few times. When I went to plug everything back in, the Fire Stick never gave me trouble about needing to set things up again. Third: I do suggest you use the extender with it as it helps keep it just a little away from the back of the tv but it also helps enhance wifi signal, where I have mine that is a plus. I have had it just over a week and have not had to unplug it due to overheating ar anything else. The Alexa voice remote is small and convenient, I will admit that I like asking Alexa to find whatever genre of movie I am in the mood for.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I now have an Amazon Firestick on all four of the TV's in my house.  I absolutely love the interface, and the fact that I can get Netflix and Prime and Hulu, in addition to several other applications, has made my television watching so enjoyable.  I'm in the process of slowly cutting the cord to my cable television provider, and the Firestick is giving me the confidence to move forward. I have no problem with the streaming quality, the picture, the sound, or the options. I absolutely love these, and highly recommend them to anybody. I don't have any of them integrated with my Alexa Echo Dot, and at this point I don't plan to.  I have a family member named Alexa, and ""Alexa"" kept trying to answer me and take commands whenrver I mentioned my Alexa's name.  Kinda funny - kind of annoying!",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
I finally cut the cord and loaded up my TV's around the house with these or their HD predecessors.  There are so many apps available that my transition from satellite TV to streaming services has been almost seamless.  What is really nice is that you can control the firetv sticks with an app on your phone so you don't necessarily always have to locate the remote.Wireless reception on firestick can be a little weak.  If you have them far from the router and want to stream live events you may end up with breaks in the video while it reconnects.  Invest in a wifi booster or mesh system to help with this.,4,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0

So unless I waste the $150 I spent on my 3 firestick cbs replace with 3 competitors devices for at least an the $120, I'm sick with sling, with less options, because I udder ft with fire stick.

With fire stick with voice command has just a few glitches quits working after a power surge which we have many but it's easy to reprogram Alexa.

All other devices (including the Roku we had been using) work perfectly, so I knew there was not an internet problem. After doing a lot of research of tons of complaints of this issue, I found where someone said that adding an inexpensive ($7) hdmi extender to move the fire stick away from the TV solved that problem. So I bought the cable and now it is working perfectly.

My kid can just ask for a specific show and the fire stick will find it among all of our streaming services including Netflix, Disney & prime. We have a basic fire stick in our bedroom that also works great. I like this 4k one because it automatically programmed itself to control the volume of the soundbar and it can turn on & off all of the components of the TV without juggling many remotes.

You can easily download various Apps, but I do wish it was a bit clearer on which ones were pay and which were really free.

The replacement (refurbished) unit had been programmed to a different remote, and it was an older software release. It took several hours to get it working correctly and get all the software updates installed. As a warning to others, if you have a defective unit, send it back and ask for a refund.

"I am a broadband technician and I will tell you that I come across Trouble calls for slow internet connection and many times when its a streaming device I see it to be these Firesticks.

I have 450mbps off a Nighthawk 1900, 4k Sony Bravia Tv  and it is flawless  when I stream on my Xbox one and other devices, but when I used this firestick (5G) it was soo slow and kept loosing connection. I was streaming ""Band of Brothers"" series and it kept buffering or loosing  picture quality.  I understand that like any products you buy there will always be ""Lemons"" but I have been seeing these cause issues frequently at work. As  broad band techs If we go out on a trouble call and see this device as the cause of slow streaming there will be a charge of between $35 to $50 for the visit because we can prove that our service provided equipment works just fine in most cases. I went ahead and returned this Firestick 4k and bought a Roku Ultra and immediately it was like night and day, if you have your router right next to the Tv and you want to use a streaming device then I highly recommend making sure your Roku has the Ethernet port included which the Roku Ultra has. If you have an Xbox one then that would be your best bet because it comparably is a beast of a processor but if not the Roku Ultra is cheaper and will do well. FYI the PS4 limits you on what apps you can use like the Cable provider apps, if you decide to go use a console for streaming the Xbox one does not have app limitations. Sorry if I offended some Firestick fans out there but ""It is what it is"", maybe its the quality control or maybe the processor on those Firesticks but like they say ""you get what you pay for"".",2,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I have used Apple Tv, Roku, and the Fire Tv stick and the Fire Tv Stick is the best of all of them now that they have added a power button and volume control.  Previous editions would only allow you to put the stick to sleep and you would need your TV remote to turn off power and a controller for you sound, especially if you had a sound bar like it do.  Now, I can control everything I need with one remote.  Apple already had the volume function which was one of the advantages for using that product.  Also, if you are an Apple user, the Apple Tv may be better for you.  I am an Android user and a bit of a tech guy, so the Fire Tv stick offers me more features because of its open source capabilities.  I highly recommend.  I have one for every tv",5,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0
"We bought the Fire Stick to replace our old Air Tv Player (Sling TV).  According to reviews, the Fire TV Stick had the widest compatibility with apps so we gave it a try.  So far the player has worked well. Installation was easy. We picked up an RJ-45 converter to connect directly to our router so streaming signal is great. Controls are simple and the menus are easy to understand.  Alexa is a big help when searching and makes it easier to find movies and shows.  So why only 2 stars? The high hopes we had for app integration ended up being a huge let down.  Before I get into it, I freely admit to the fact that I may not have done “enough” research on this device and how Amazon has it set up. My opinion however, hasn’t changed.1. Vudu is not an available app (We have 400+ movies on Vudu).  Despite the fact that Vudu has been available on every streaming box we have ever owned, Amazon refuses to add it. An “altered” version of Vudu is available for the Fire TV Stick. installation requires a specific third party app for installation, The process is tedious and is too complicated for most users. The app you eventually get will allow you to stream your media but nothing more.",2,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I have an older TV with no smart TV capability.  I don't have cable but wanted a way to stream video.  After a thorough review of all the alternatives I landed on this product.Ultimately I don't have much issue with the product.  It mostly works great.  The only downside I've seen so far is that during long-term use (binge watching a show, watching a stream for 30-45 mins or more) it will get stuck ""buffering"" and stop playing the video.  When this happens the device has to be restarted to work again.  At first I thought this was a WiFi/Internet issue.  After ensuring that wasn't the case, I did a google search of the issue and others have reported similar problems.",4,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
It's very special when you buy electronic goodies and they are this easy to use.  Honestly I do not subscribe to any streaming services and am not a Prime member. What? you ask. Why bother? I really like listening to my Amazon Music app. No I don't subscribe to that either. I listen to my MP3 files which I have accumulated through Amazon's MP3 store. The added benefit is it gets us to stop watching so much TV! Music sounds pretty good even through my inexpensive sound bar. (Audiophiles need not comment) Some day when 4K content becomes more widespread I might actually spring for a pay streaming app.:-),5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"Absolutely love this fire stick and remote. Works flawlessly, the Alexa feature works great and saves lots of time and clicking! Our smart TV is a 2015, so many of the apps and features don't work quickly or correctly, this fire stick took care of all of these issues, I only wish it was compatible with our particular sound bar, then we would only require one remote.",5,1,2018-11-15,1,1,0
"Arrived quickly. Was well-packaged. Plugging it into the TV went quickly. Struggled a bit with finding our network. But the real trouble was when it started re-starting itself and shutting off what you were watching. Had to resort to web search, only to find page after page indicating this was a known problem. It took forever to find a fix that worked for us. We finally did find a solution, though at this point I cannot tell you which fix we ended up with. The reception is good.

"I love the firestick. I've never owned one until now after being giving 4 to ""jailbreak"".... First people stop saying ""jailbreak"", adding apps to the firestick is not ""jailbreaking"". Jailbreaking is a term used when you modify or alter Root or administratior files in the OS. Ok now back to my review.. I do not like the fact that Amazon took game controller support away from the 4k stick. So I've also purchased a 2nd gen stick for that purpose.Edit: JUNE 1st 2019",5,1,2019-5-31,1,0,0
"The firestick does everything pretty well.  It does seems to go pretty slow with some Apps.  Usually the better the picture quality the slower it goes to start loading it.  Also you have to be careful at how many apps you put on it.  It held enough for me, but I had to get rid of as many of the preloaded ones it would let me that I did not need.  If this is for use in your main room for television watching check the apps you will be using for other's experiences with it.  I only had one app that was the real problem, so I just don't use it on my firestick.  ALL the AMAZON apps work great with it.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0

It uses IR to do that and there is no way to make the thing to work with purely CEC.

The biggest selling point for me was that it easily controlled my TV and soundbar as well--3 remotes condensed to one tiny one!  All seemed great except for one thing; there is no universal search feature like the Roku has.  The Roku search much more clearly shows you what you can watch for free and what it costs on other channels in one shot.  The Fire TV interface is prettier, but doesn't as clearly show all of your options when searching vs. the Fire TV.",3,1,2019-4-13,1,1,0
CONS - I have not been CLEAR as to which programs/services are FREE and have not been able to get the LOCAL Channels on the Firestick.  I have Comcast X-finity but have not been able to Comast programming on the Firestick because there are no clear instructions available and I do NOT want to accidentally sign up for something I have to pay extra for.  Took a long time to update itself when first hooked up (I have DSL).  I would like to manage either Comcast service and/or antenna viewing through the Firestick but have not been able to do so.PROS - hoooking It up is easy.  Remote works well.

"I am beyond thrilled with my Fire stick! We have an older TV that does not stream but does have HDMI capability. I had purchased a DVD streaming device and it was horrible, took forever to load,picture was not clear and would freeze up. We thought we'd have to buy a whole new TV....NOT! I started researching different devices and made sure they were compatible with our TV. I took the leap and ordered the Fire Stick 4K on Black Friday. Really easy to install and I can not tell you enough how thrilled we are. The speed, the clarity of the picture, how easy the installation was, etc. I am glad I did not purchase the extender because it came with one and it fit in the back of our TV perfect.

Ambitiously I upgraded to the 4k Firestick and well the signal ended up worse than the original (Except for 4k movies which are awesome) but my live sports with(300mps wifi with upgraded modem) have been fragmented again along with a really choppy picture on alot of channels and delayed action. The 4k remote is great with volume controls now, but the HDR setting, that you can't turn off is the most annoying part of the new 4k firestick.,",2,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0
Problem with data usage have had numerous inter actions with customer service. They downloaded data usage file over 10 days ago with no response. Have called numerous times disconnected transferred to 8 different people still no solution I suggested might be the new 4k firestick I purchased and they agreed to send a new one. I received a refurbished unit . Piss poor customer service. No technical knowledge of their product. All they can say is you have a trouble ticket and they are working on it! Give it another 24 hrs for a response. It been 96 hours now! Dont buy firestick with a limited data cap. I have ota antenna using the firestick recast and not streaming videos and used 1.32 tb of data. Looking at their usage data doesnt make sense. I put it to sleep and turn it off and still use data.

I rebooted my router, even input my internet name and password. You can find that screen by pressing enter while the firestick is in the search mode. After a couple days of trying I found a site that said to reboot the firestick. Well that was the answer, within seconds it connected, downloaded new software and was ready to go.

I will say that after I watched it on Hulu, she did start opening it in the Hulu app.I don’t know if this is an Alexa feature or not,  but if you pause for an extended period of time, whatever you were watching goes away.

"I am happy with Roku Ultra, but since it doesn't let you surf the internet, I got this.  I was also using PS4 to watch YouTube and surf the net, but I also need to mirror my laptop to TV, but PS4 made it a little more complicated.  So I got this Fire Stick.  I like the fact that I could stream live TV via internet with Fire Stick, but YouTube gets too many commercials in between that I never get with Roku Ultra and PS4.  Also, my Roku Ultra rarely disconnects my laptop, but Fire Stick kept on disconnecting my laptop that I could not watch anything.  Since it doesn't have an adblock feature on the browsers, I wanted to use google chrome to block the ads and stream through my laptop, but it kept on disconnecting.  So mirror functions is almost useless for streaming.  I'm not sure about for pictures.  Fire Stick has ways to install adblock feature, but didn't really work.  I think it skips some ads, but there are too many ads that I still use my PS4 for watching YouTube.  It's not convenient to hop to one machine to another.  It's worth getting it for $25, but not at $50.  But it can do a lot of things Roku can't do.  So I guess depends on what you do more.  Built-in Alexa is pretty good except that it leaves from what you were watching to answer.",3,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0

I tried another Fire Stick (not 4K) we had on another tv on the LG tv and problem finding internet disappeared, so I ordered the 4K version and haven’t had a connectivity problem since.  The picture is awesome, it connected easily with the sound bar and offered us some options we didn’t have on the LG tv (i.e. Paramount app to watch Yellowstone).  Also have loved watching all my photos on the tv through a Prime Photo.  For me the weak link is Alexa.  Most of what she does can be done easier with the remote.

"Amazon sent me a coupon for $20 off for a Fire Stick. Before I ordered it I looked around on the website and found this version.  I will be buying a 4K TV in the future, so I decided to buy this one with the Echo Dot. I have a Chromecast gathering dust, it heats up pretty good when being used and you have to be nearby to use it. I ordered it on Saturday evening and it was at my door early Monday morning. Setup was easy once I got it out of the box. My TV is a 720 10 year old TV. The clarity on the video was amazing.  I then setup the Echo Dot, it was a little confusing at first until I installed the app on my phone. Setup was easy after that and I had it up and running within a few minutes. When you say ""Alexa"" into the remote for the Fire Stick, the Echo Dot responds as well, as does the app on the phone. It appears to understand that you are wanting the Fire Stick to play a video when you mention it.  What would be really cool is if you could ask the Echo Dot to play a video on the TV. Or did I miss that feature?  We will see. I recommend using one, it is definitely different from the ChromeCast.",5,1,2018-11-20,1,1,0

Amazon has no reference for this, either.  Neither I, nor Amazon, nor the internet know what this means.  Amazon does many things well, Fire Stick support is not one of them.",3,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0

"We have come a long way... We have used playstation, Apple TV and Fire stick. We love Fire Stick the most out of all the products that we've used in the past. It's intuitive and easy to use. I love that the Amazon music carries on the music as we search movies to watch. I don't like that they don't show recently watched movie when turned on but it's alright. Oh, sometimes I am frustrated with the remote because it's so sleek! It slips from everywhere. Often times, I find the remote control on the floor but it's not a problem. We enjoy it and we love it!",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"I like the new remote that can power on the TV and speakers with the power button.  The volume controls are also great.  I can now do all functions with just the Fire Stick remote.  The short extension cord for the HDMI connector also allowed me to plug in the stick w/o crowding issues.  Alexa is available by pressing the mike button and does not require the 'Alexa' keyword.  It's also not listening in when not addressed.This is the cheapest way to get 4k access to Amazon prime (Netflix, Hulu, and many more) and Alexa.  The performance is good.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
"Fire Stick 4k is ok. The Alexa voice control works pretty good but the biggest problem i have with it is the processing speed, Bluetooth and wifi streaming. My stick freezes often and is slow to make changes. The Bluetooth connectivity is abysmal no matter the headphone maker Samsung, Bose, etc. Lastly streaming Hulu sucks. I don't know if the stick is designed to do this with Hulu to push you to use Prime but I have 5G pushing 200mb 2ft from the stick and Hulu is irritatingly laggy. Prime streams perfect. Other than than these issues it works great.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0

This thing is fast and very responsive! The new remote is a nice upgrade as you can now control volume and have the ability to power on/off your TV.As far as speed, this new 4k Stick is snappier than my Fire TV 3 Pendant! I was shocked because the new 4k stick only has 1.5gb ram compared to 2gb ram on the pendant, but then I found out the new 4k Stick has ddr4 ram compared to ddr3 ram on the pendant.",5,1,2018-11-25,1,0,0
6 months or so ago I had bought a 2nd gen fire TV stick with the new remote for my bedroom as my Roku stick I had at the time went out so I replaced it with that one.  It was ok though it had the tendency to be laggy at times but I loved the remote.  Well for black Friday they had the 4k sticks on sale and I have heard those are much more responsive and so far that has been the case.  This one is way more snappy than the old one.  I don't have a 4k tv at the moment so I can't test out those functions but as far as everything else it works great.  I was hesitant for a long time to use voice functions on my TV but lately I have been using it far more than typing stuff using a directional pad.  I like that if the movie or show I want to watch is on another service besides Amazon it will point me to the other services that have that particular show in case I have that service instead of opting to rent or buy on Amazon as the only choice.,5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0

I received my Amazon Fire Stick 4K. I immediately activated it and subscribed to Sling. The next day I get my Promo Code and try to redeem it on Sling. The code is rejected as Invalid or Ineligible because I didn't redeem the the code when I signed up for Sling. The credit is only for new subscribers. Sling said I was no longer a new subscriber and was not eligible for the credit. Do not subscribe to Sling until you get your Amazon Promo code or you will be deemed ineligible. Amazon Customer service tried to give me a work around that was a pain in the rear.  Amazon needs to have  an override code that will reverse this hassle.,1,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0

If I still had a nicer archaic TV model I would've bought a Fire Stick ages ago, but instead just bought Smart TVS.The Fire Stick is AWESOME...my grief is with the NHL Network and their streaming services. You can not access the pre-downloaded app on a Roku Smart TV, but instead are forced to buy a Roku Stick, Chromecast or in my case an Amazon Fire Stick.

I'm finding that most of the time, it works really well, the remote is easy to use, and I'm happy with it.  Every now and then, however, the audio gets disconnected from the video and it's weird to watch.  Lately, it's gotten worse and the audio is really patchy.  On those evenings, I just go back to my Sony remote and standard Internet input.  It usually fixes itself by the next day.  As long as I have a workaround, I'm fine, if this were the only device I was using, it would be a problem.",4,1,2019-3-11,1,0,0

I should’ve bought a long time ago but felt it was to expensive. But after purchasing on monthly installments I was too excited to get mine and it is perfect! My tv is not a smart tv but it is now because of “Alexa”. I now can see all my prime tv shows and movies and also listen to my music. I only need one remote now because it can be programmed to turn tv on and off also.Thank you for such a wonderful product.,5,1,2019-7-14,1,2,0

Ridiculous! I bought two of these as part of a holiday promotion. Setup was easy and customization simple. The problem is that playback skips on both devices despite a solid internet connection. I looked online for solutions and found that many experience this problem. The only solution that works for me is to reset the router or the device but it is unacceptable to have to do this multiple times in a day! Amazon tech support was so unhelpful that I disconnected the call after twenty minutes! They suggested that I call my ISP to verify that the router is using the correct channel - nonsense when everything else connected to the router works fine. I wish it were possible to give zero stars for these firesticks.,1,1,2019-2-8,1,0,0

Will probably outfit the 4 remaining with this new version and even retire the first generation Fire Stick TV as this version is so much ""slicker"" at this time.If you are looking to get rid of your traditional cable/satellite/""triple play"" provider and use other services (I have several but primary is now Hulu ""Live"" with add-ons) I highly recommend!",5,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0

Tried it again a few days later, remote didn't even turn the TV on, only got a blue light when I pressed the microphone button. Tried today with another new set of batteries, remote is totally dead.  I checked my order statues for returning it, the return window is closed but it shows that a replacement may be possible but there is no way to execute it.

Even when it is closed, you can see and feel that it doesn't quite fit tightly enough!  I understand your trying to keep the cost down and this is probably a cheaper way to manufacture it.  but no one wants to have to tape their brand new remote so it stays closed!!!  The remotes for my older fire sticks never gave me a problem.  If it Ain't broke don't fix it!!!  It give the whole product a look and feel of poor quality!!!",3,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"This is a very good product to begin with. I bought it because it was inexpensive even though all of the streaming devices I have right now are Chromecast. What surprised me is that this one comes with a remote which is quire well designed. I can use voice command to have it do things for me. The only drawback is that I can no longer use Google Chrome to send video to the streamer. I guess I should not blame Amazon for this; rather, I shall blame the narrow-minded electronic world that won't let their devices talk to one another.

Both work very well and we have had no problem with streaming quality on either circuit.One thing we have discovered is that it is not as easy to cut the cord as one might thing.  When you look at the cost having an Internet circuit at your house for streaming plus the cost of a live TV streaming service it comes out about the same as the cable company's Internet / TV package.  The only advantage is that the Fire device can be moved around with you so the service can go wherever you go i.e. vacation, etc.",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"This 4k Firestick is da bomb, especially at Black Friday discount pricing!!!  I’ve been a Dish Network subscriber for over a decade and have been looking to cut the cord (it’s a long cord to reach a satellite!) given annual price increases through the years.  This new Firestick will be just the ticket for that as I’m looking to transition to YouTube TV most likely by end of 2019.The lady of the house believes that wireless EMF is problematic health-wise, so our setup required mating the Amazon Ethernet adapter with the Firestick for a fully wired solution.  Ordered both at the same time and they worked great right out of the box: plug and play into our 10 year old Samsung 52” LCD TV.  No muss, no fuss.  The HD picture is fantastic as is the audio.  Downloading/installing apps is quick and painless.  The speed with which one can move from one app to another is nice and snappy.  I have yet to experience a buffering problem with any of the content.  My old Sony Blue-ray player/streaming appliance had excessively interminable content buffering as a “feature”.  It’s so nice to be done with that.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0

"Took me a long time to figure out how to use with my Samsung LED tv (bought in 2010).  It's an older model flat screen and not the newer smart Samsung Smart TV's.  It uses Anynet+ for any peripheral devices (I think newer models still use this program).  I plugged the Firestick into the HDMI slot on the TV read it as a new input with the Anynet+ on.  However, when I tried to access the Firestick, it would state ‘No signal Detected’.  Some forums say to make sure it's plugged into the primary HDMI port.  I tried all the HDMI ports on the TV with the same result.  I decided to update the firmware on the TV (which I hadn't done...ever).  Once I did that I found an old CAT5 cable and went ahead and plugged that into my router and the TV instead of using my wifi (the router was inside a cabinet just below the TV so all the lines are out of sight).  Once I finished all of those steps, I turned on the Anynet+, clicked on the Firestick and it opened up!  I went ahead and updated the firmware on the Firestick and started setting everything up.  I can't remember if I tried connecting to the wifi after updating the TV firmware.  Bottom line, it works with the CAT5 so I might just keep it that way.  Firestick works great....just the initial setup with the Samsung was a pain in the a$s!",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0

Echo Dot which, if we're being honest, is completely worthless, and the integration with the FireStick TV is abysmal. Every once in awhile, a vocal command through the Echo Dot will actually pair well with the FireStick and bring up the content I'm asking for, but not at all reliably.

"I got this after my sister-in-law mentioned she had one. I was tired of having to stream our Amazon Prime Video content through our Apple TV via mirroring it from my computer of phone. The Fire Stick made it possible to stream it directly. Even better, it gave us may options we didn't have before, such as being able to find things quickly just by asking Alexa. I was amazed to find that I could use the remote and Alexa to switch between inputs to the TV and to change cable channels by telling Alexa which one to tune to. Through a friend, I found out about the Kanopy app, which the  provides a direct way to view the content from my Kanopy account (great film content through our participating library). The only problem we had was getting the remote open the first time to install the batteries. This was easily solved by running a razor knife gently between the two sides.

Love the new stick.  I have every generation of these buggers and this is my favorite.  The new version is much smaller than the first 4K diamond design.  The speed is on par if not better and the new features on the remote are what I've been waiting for.  The biggest upgrade to the new remote is the IR control of secondary devices such as your TV and SoundBar/AMP.  The new remote can turn these devices on/off as well as control the volume from your preferred device.  I was able to pick a few up over the holidays on Amazon's holiday pricing saving me a good bit of change.  I've installed these new sticks on 1080 sets just because of the new remote functionality.

"We ordered this after our original firestick remote crapped out. The 4K was a nice upgrade. However, we still experience a lag or storage issue. Apps have locked up or frozen. I have to routinely go through and clear cache or restart about once a week. The remote has lasted longer than the original one did which is nice. Quality seems there in picture quality.Alexa is push activated only. I have had no real issue with it.

"I finally switched from using a streaming Sony BluRay player to the Firestick. Wow, no comparison in the speed at which this stick trounces the BluRay player. I have the stick hardwired via an optional ethernet adaptor due to having an old slower router. Just the speed at which the stick can navigate through apps and program choices is worth the price and my sanity. I don't have a 4K TV and have no plans for it at this time, but the speed of the new chip was worth the slightly higher price of the 3rd generation stick.  The Cons: The volume control button is ridiculously slow and thus I can't even use that feature. I use my stereo receiver remote for volume control.",5,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0

The ease of setup and the ability to move the device between television sets makes this product far superior to past versions and to other products.

It's completely off which sucks cause that was a big part of why I got this to replace my Roku. Also if you don't use it for a day you have unplug it from the TV and plug it back in or it won't register at all. Which I hate cause my Roku stays on and it doesn't matter how many days I don't use it it's always there. I even checked to see if it was on a sleep timer and it's all turned off so I don't know why the fire stick does this.

I already had an Apple TV so I knew I would keep that device, but I wanted to add two more at lower cost. The fire tv stick ratings and reviews were great, so I purchased one to see if I could trust what I read. Well, the set up was the fastest and easiest of any product I have ever made to sync with a tv; the steaming quality; excellent, so I bought a second one. Now true, I am using a 1G internet provider to get a high quality overall, but this device and its features are so easy to use that one of any age can find what they want when they want with ease.

"Update: Got another 4k Firestick sent to me to replace the original instead of getting a refund. It did the same thing. Have to unplug and reboot it every few days to reset it and make the volume come back. Time consuming when I can run all the same apps on my Smart TV now. Older (non 4k) ones we have work much better. Amazon buried my first review, so I am sure this one gets buried as well.Worked well for a week. Now about 30% of the time, this thing will play without any volume. Nothing in settings makes it work. You have to unplug it's power source and let it reboot to get the sound to play again. This is very annoying since its a mounted television with all the wires and plugs behind the tv. It's a wired connection, so they can't blame it on connectivity. And now we don't bother and just switch over to the smart TV apps instead (because they always have sound.) Never had issues with the non-4k versions of our Firesticks.  But the 4k version is disappointing.",1,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I bought this hoping it would work well enough to get rid of our cable which was once again raising in price.  My husband was very much NOT on board.  I told him we would try it for a week and if he didn't like it we would return.  After 3 days he had cancelled our cable subscription.  It works perfect.  We now have 3 different streaming services to choose content from, and we are spending less than half of what cable was costing.  Voice remote very convenient and we still get all but one of our favorite channels on live TV.  Was well worth it.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"Amazon has done some great things with this product. Setup is simple and straightforward and Alexa integration is really nice. However, I’m having constant problems with the WiFi connection. I should note that I have 4 of these. 2 have been working just fine, 1 was having connection issues but (after I removed the extra little usb cable and plugged directly into the TV) seems to be working now, and 1 is constantly disconnecting or shutting off completely. It doesn’t seem to be getting hot or anything and it reconnects just fine after I ask it to forget the network, then reconnect. Having to constantly reconnect is frustrating. I have a very robust WiFi network. The signal is always “strong” or “very strong” and my speed is over 250mbs.Bottom- line, when it works, I love it.",3,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
Hoped to have a full Alexa system along with my Ring cameras.  Not to be.  Firestick couldn't hold the wifi signal.....and I have excellent coverage.  Put my old Roku in and got 100% function.....so Firestick connectivity would be the biggest issue.  The rest of its function is the same as the Roku and was ok.  Won't try this system again..... maybe 3 or 6 iterations later it will be properly designed.  I don't often write less than good reviews....usually good or no review.  This was a very  inconvenient failure and I was sorely disappointed.,3,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
I have been on the phone several times with the technicians and they have corrected my problem which is that the volume controls on my handheld do not work they fix them and then they slowly go down to nothing I’m thinking about sending everything back I cannot get a hold of a technician everything has been Blamed on the coronavirus which is crap let them work from home I have to get up every night out of bed or out of my chair and put the controller right up against the TV these are not worth the money if someone does not get them fixed right away I will be Returning them to you and buying another brand. Another thing is every time you call to get a technician Amazon. does not even know that you were selling these products and that you do have in fact I technical department it’s at least 15 minutes before I got to talk to a tech mission I am a prime member and this is total unnecessary aggravation.

"Have 3 4K firesticks and all 3 have same problems. Sometimes get a message saying network connection lost, or the ""Home"" is not available. Have to restart the firestick (go to ""Restart"", reinstall batteries or hold down the select and pause buttons at same time for 5 seconds. Also, the Alexis voice sometimes works, sometimes not. Same thing here..after restart it may or may not work. I spent 1 1/2 hours on the phone with one of Amazon's tech reps and he could not find nor fix the problem. His solution was to send a replacement. Same thing happening. That's 4 units. Not a coincidence..bad product. Not much testing before putting on the market to make the ""almighty dollar"". R & D and QA departments need to fix this. Don't expect a reply as complaints usually wind up in the shredder. Just not a happy Amazon customer.",2,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
I bought the highest quality one for my grandma. She has had it for about a month and has one of the highest quality internet's but it continues to stop working. I am continuously having to restart the firestick because it continues to say there is no broadband when she pays a hundred and something a month for Comcast and is the only one that uses it. I thought it would be something easy for her and it has come of huge problem she has to call me every time it is broken so that I can fix it because she doesn't understand how it happens many times in the middle of her shows. Unless you want to restart it all the time it's not something I recommend unless some kind of bug can be fixed,1,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0
"I love the Fire stick, easily installed and quickly connected to my WiFi. It bluetoothed flawlessly with my Sony headphones. The UI is attractive and the way it behaves works to tie in all my installed apps. It even pulls up my Ring video outside via Alexa. I think the only weakness when comparing to my older Roku device is the search features are less enhanced on the Fire. Roku searches a name and then can bring up an entire filmography showing a list of apps (installed AND uninstalled ) where u can find the film.  I have hopes the Fire will grow in this area.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"So far so good. Newest version is quicker to load streamed than previous version and just quicker overall navigation wise. Only complaint, and this is minor, is that the remote is able to turn off and on my TV and sound bar, but not able switch inputs on the TV to go from Fire TV to over the air local channels for example.  If it was able to do so I could more to one remote. Again, minor but is something I would like to see at some point. Very happy with the purchase overall. Very happy with my move to cut the cord and go fully streaming.",5,1,2018-11-18,1,1,0
"Upgraded from the first gen Fire TV stick purchased in 2014. While the original was nice, it was sometimes painstakingly slow, apps would frequently hang or crash, and it would routinely lose wifi connection.The improvement was immediately noticeable once swapping out with the 4k version. Apps load instantly, streaming media starts nearly immediately with very little buffering, and the video quality is outstanding.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I've only had for a little over 4 months and now its trash. I've always had an issue with the sound going out and having to unplug and plug back in for the sound to come back. Wasnt sure if it was the tv or firestick so I never sent it back for an exchange. Well here I am in the middle of a video when the whole screen suddenly turns bright pink. Everything is pink. No way to fix it and now I can no longer return the item.

But even using it as a clueless old guy, I find plenty to watch. The video and sound coming through it are very impressive (and make my new 4K TV and soundbar definitely worth it), and the voice recognition worked without training: I just pushed the button and talked. Given how few voice activated systems can understand my hybrid Southern drawl/mid-western/Massachusetts/Long Island accent, I was pleasantly surprised by this last feature.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"The perfect solution for a non-smart TV. It has all the apps I could want, Youtube, Netflix, Prime Video, firefox, and hundreds more. But my favorite thing about the fire stick is how responsive it is. It never gets held up loading something. Alexa is snappy, youtube loads as fast as any computer, and voice control might just be the way of the future. OH! And the universal remote setup? I don't know how it figures it out, but you don't even need to do anything. It goes through a quick setting-up screen, and then suddenly it can control the TV itself. VOL/PWR",5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"Love it.My only complaints are there is no way to disable the sleep function without hacking it or following some insanely convoluted procedure (the ones I tried didn't work), and occasionally the sound cuts out. The only way I've found to fix this is to turn it off, wait, and turn it on again while hoping the sound comes back.

"Edited to add it wasnt this product that had the glitches, it was my 14 yo tv. The tv have up the ghost and this works great on the news one.  I'm giving this four stars bc of the issue I'm having but in general the firesticks I own haven't given me any problems. In this case the voice control/search feature switches the HDMI channel from the one I'm using to the one I'm not using. So I am still using two remotes. I can deal with it but it is difficult for my spouse, who is a c5/6 quad, to find those buttons with no manual dexterity or feeling.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
I used the product in order to be able to control my tv as well as be able to display my blink and ring products on the tv. THe issue is that Alexa is NOT able to do all that the firestick remote can do. For example the remote voice command enables me to turn off the tv but trying to get Alexa to do that will not work even after I linked the Echo device to the firestick. The support person told me that I just have to live with the fact the the firestick remote can do things that Alexa cannot and that does not make any sense to me because the voice remote is ALEXA so why would giving the command through an echo linked device not work?,3,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"Got this to replace our original fire stick since it’s a few years old now and got extremely slow. I love that it has the power and volume controls, but there’s a super annoying flicker that pops up every once in a while. Usually it’s contained to one part of the screen and goes away after a minute, but now it’s starting to flicker the whole screen and doesn’t stop until you force quit Netflix, even if Netflix isn’t being used. Pretty disappointing for something that cost $50, but we already threw out the box so I guess we’ll be dealing with it for now.",2,1,2020-5-23,1,2,0
"I got my new Fire TV Stick a few weeks ago.  Not my first one, and I also have a Fire TV Box.  Obviously, I really like them connected to my TVs.  After using it for a few weeks, I tried to use the voice control and nothing happened.  I did a little research online and after not finding a solution to it soon enough, I called Fire TV customer support.  After on hold for about 20 minutes, I finally talked to someone who said, ""Sure, NP, I would like to help you out.  It will only cost you $100 for me to talk you thru getting your voice control to work.""  I couldn't believe it.  $100!!! I hung up and did further research and found out, all I had to do was go to myfiretv in settings and click on restart.  At first, it didn't work, but after a few minutes, my voice button worked just fine.  Once I knew the solution, it took less than a minute for me to find the restart button and fix the problem.  $100 ???  I could have gotten screwed out of a lot of money for the simplest of fixes.  I almost feel like I avoided being gang raped because I got lucky and a cop car happened by.  Anyway, that is my experience.  Customer service wanted $100 to fix a $40 item that was brand new.

I'll get a notice saying that the internet is connected but with problems. I researched the problem, followed the recommendations and 3-4 times a week I will power off the fire stick and then turn it back on. when I don't use the stick and stream normally through my t.v., I have no issues, so It's not an internet speed issue.

The best explanation i could receive was, ""Our technical team is working on this to resolve this."" Looking back I've seen several similar posts on the internet dating 6-8 months ago of people complaining about the same thing so I have my doubts that anyone is actually working on it. It's disappointing that such a prominent device in the company would have such a major malfunction with no resolution for so long.

They all do the same thing and I don’t understand why the Apple TV is so expensive. The Firestick’s remote is the best due to the mute button, Apple’s remote is too small, lacks buttons and is “slippery” to handle.  Setup was also the easiest, it recognized my sound bar and TV during setup. The interface is also very good. Many reviewers complain that Amazon content dominates the splash page but I don’t think that is valid. I see Hulu, Direct TV Now Netflix etc immediately after turning on the TV.

Had for a year. Only within last two months it’s been having this issue where it freezes after I dismiss the screensaver.

Sometimes it’ll accept the play or back buttons but then the subtitles will disappear and the play and forward/back scrubber buttons will too. It’s really frustrating and makes me try to pause for less than a minute so I don’t have to hunt for my movie from the home screen. Echo Auto has issues too since the 13.2.3 iOS update.

"Amazon is now what Apple used to be - easy to use, consumer friendly, and plug and play.  I bought the firestick because I wanted to watch Mandalorian on the Disney + app and I wanted access to my  apple library without using apple TV which, frankly, sucks.The firestick was super easy to set up, recognized my sony soundbar and automatically configured stuff, and just worked.  Well done, Amazon.  I just bought another one for upstairs.  Highly recommend.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
We cut the cord some time ago. I have tried several streaming devices and went with the fire stick. My old fire sticks would occasionally buffer but nothing major. I saw where the 4K Fire stick had more storage and was more powerful with better wi-fi capability. Hooked it up and WOW ! I have done all I can ( Using several wi-fi connected devices at once ) to get this thing to buffer and it still keeps streaming along. I'm sure that during peak times it may slow down (maybe not) but for now it is the best (IMHO) streaming device out there.,5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"I bought this Fire Stick with the understanding that I could stream other media services (non-Amazon) from my Kindle Fire 10 Tablet to my Smart TV. Forget it!!! There are no apps to support this function and the Fire Stick is not of any value in that area. I can stream Amazon Prime shows from ""both"" my Windows 10 Laptop and my Kindle Fire 10 to my Smart TV -""BUT"" I could do that before without the need of a Fire Stick. I don't see a value in the Fire stick - unless you do not have any device that can stream Amazon Prime content to a smart TV. Again - This is ""not"" the device you need to stream other media services that are not Amazon Prime affiliated (ie: local cable company).",1,1,2019-11-7,1,1,0
"The Fire TV stick works but was disappointed with the available apps. I purchase the fire stick thinking it had the apps for YouTube, YouTube TV, and Directv Now so I could cancel cable TV. Very disappointed to find out these apps are not available so I purchased a Roku. The Roku stick had the apps I wanted, was easier to setup and had a better GUI interface. I plan to purchase another Roku stick for another TV that does not have apps capabilities.If you are looking cut the cord for cable TV the Roku is a better solution. The Fire Stick integrate well with Prime members accounts but is not the best solution for cutting the cord. I hope the fire stick will get an app for the new Sectrum TV apps being release this month. A smart tv is still the best solution for apps my Samsung has all the apps I need.",3,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
"My overall opinion of the device is not reflective of the categories that Amazon has chosen to display because I have other issues that are not included here including network drops, refusal to reboot, and overall storage space.I've had the current model of the Fire TV 4k for less than 3 months. When it works, it works well. However, the issue is that once every week or two, it will suddenly decide not to connect to my network or will connect to the network but not allow for data. I have had this issue regardless of whether the device is connected wirelessly or via Amazon's official ethernet adapter (my router is also fewer than 10 feet away from the device - I got the ethernet adapter because the 5GHz signal of both this one and the previous would periodically disconnect).",2,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0

"I haven’t use the voice recognition or the Alexa integration, but it works well. It’s nice to be able to use one remote to turn on the TV and turn the volume up and down when I’m using it. Make sure when you buy it the fire stick is in stock. Mine was supposed to ship at a later date and every time they checked a location for it they withheld money from my bank account on hold so I was not happy about that. I had to call Amazon headquarters to get it straight. This was the only purchase from Amazon that I was not happy about and I would never buy a product again that was not in stock.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"First off I am not real techy as a ""young"" senior (56) but I can tell you this that I was able to do it myself by following the instructions. It was quite simple once you know were your HDMI ports are on the TV, I just follow the set up instruction on TV however when adding your apps like Netflix and Hulu you will need to access your username/password to get it install. If you are not good at using the remote to log in your password and stuff ask a youngster as they will probably be able to whip through it for you. I just took my time and did it myself. I don't know why it took me forever to get it on TV as I watch my stuff on my laptop. Anyway, it's better to see your streaming on TV than on a device as the blue screen is not good for eyes or sleep..believe me I've had some sleepless nights and I know it was because I was looking at too much computer screen. Hope this helps. If I can do it , you can too!",5,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0

When everything works it's great, but once in maybe a few dozen power ups my system cannot detect it's outputting video r that it's even there, I have to restart everything for it to be recognized. Also, the included remote is just dumb with power consumption: I will put batteries that test to have a fine charge in, even brand new ones, and within an hour I'm being told that the batteries are extremely low and the connection becomes intermittent.",4,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"What a great product.  It can switch your television off/on and has great features including voice recognition (search for a show as an example).  This was my second Fire Stick.  Very happy I've cut the cable.  Do note that some of the apps require some sort of sign into (usually a cable provider user account).  But with multiple apps, you can probably find most things you want (and some you didn't know existed).  You can even add an Ethernet connection instead of using the WiFi.  Works good for me.  Very happy with this unit/purchase.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I won this in a contest so I didn't have to pay for it, which is good because I feel like the price may be too much for what you get. If I had to describe the product in one word, it would be ""decent"". For the fire stick itself, it's not bad. I've been using it for a while and the Alexa features are okay when they work, but I struggle with it a lot. The stream quality is good if you have a steady internet connection. Overall, there are only a few problems that I have with it. The first is Alexa, which I've already gone over. The second is the power supply. Technically you can use a power outlet from another source instead of using the included plug, but you might get error messages when doing that, or it might not work at all. Maybe I'm nitpicking though. The last issue is the price. For less money, you can get a better streaming device with similar capabilities, identical app support, etc. Or you could just stream your phone to the TV since most tv's are smart these days. Overall, it seems like you would get the most value out of this if you don't have a smart TV, but if that's the case then you might want to reconsider spending the money on this, when it roughly equates to half of the price of your average smart TV. No judgement though. If you don't have a 4k TV, I would recommend the regular HD fire stick since it can display up to 1080p resolution and has the same features for half the price, which i would consider to be fair.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Overall great device. Minimal issues with it and easy fix. Navigates well throughout the supported apps. Too bad most everything I  choose to watch with prime has additional charge to rent/buy, even 20 and 30 year old movies ! The 4K picture quality appears to be quite good on my 70 in. screen. Remote is simple after getting use to it, but for me the small size, all black (easy to misplace or see), buttons too close together (small and easy to hit wrong button, especially with low light room). But all said I find it to bell a good choice for navigation, it is a great way to upgrade an older TV to have smart TV operation.",4,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"We've had this Fire Stick for a few months now and it has fizzled out many times. Sometimes when we go to turn on the TV to use the Fire Stick, the entire screen will be filled with static and will make a terrible noise. The only way we've been able to ""fix"" this issue is by unplugging the Fire Stick for a few seconds, and plugging it back in. Other times, we've experienced the entire screen flashing--so we unplug the device again and restart everything.It definitely seems like there's a bug in the stick--I'm not sure if we purchase a lemon, or if all Fire Sticks are created equally. I wouldn't recommend this exact model if all of them are glitchy like this. I rated this 2 stars because it does work sometimes. I just feel like technology should be past this kind of issue by now in 2019.",2,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"I love how all the Amazon devices integrate so well with each other. I have a Show, two dots, and now a Fire Stick.  One of the easiest setups. Plus Amazon does not put itself above other services or make the interface hard.  If you're a bigger Netflix watcher, no worries, your Netflix appears at the top of the screen for easy access.  Has browser capabilities.  Voice recognition and output is remarkable and accurate.  From vague commands like ""Rom Com"" to ""German WWII Movies"" it seems to handle both with equal ease.  Majorly happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0

Movies Anywhere only carries movies from certain studios, but I didn't read the fine print, or so it seems, or they're just not fully disclosing what they have and don't have.

I used to have the normal Fire stick and after about two weeks of using the 4K one I can totally noticed a huge difference!The main difference I see is the ability to buffer the 4K videos smoothly which was very slow on the old device and keep loading and works only with voice while the picture keep hang and cut every couple of seconds.,5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,1

I've reached out to return this, but naturally, the problems all started one day after our eligibility to return the product ended.

The picture is great, I always have to turn the sound down when accessed but the fidelity is good.  Having voice access to search is a plus.  This was well worth the money in my opinion",4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
I use an Apple TV and a Roku and find those more user friendly. Maybe I just need to get used to it. Also the cord isn't near long enough. Electric plugins of are not that close.

I also have a Toshiba Fire TV so no issues plugin wise of course but I just feel like the interface is clunky compared especially to my Apple TV. An no Vudu app!

I should have purchased this years ago. I have an older Samsung LED TV that is not smart. The 4K Firestick changed the value of the TV by adding a plethora of streaming abilities at a picture level that I did not think possible on this 13 year old Samsung. In it's day it was very impressive but by today's standards it was outdated. Not anymore due to the installation of the Firestick. Installation was a breeze and I purchased the adapter to connect to the wifi via a Cat 5 cable. I highly recommend the 4K Firestick. At the price I paid it is well worth it.,5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

I enjoy my Firestick but it does lack some apps and has frequent issues. Last time I checked there is no Vudu app however you can install a version of vudu by allowing apps from I in known sources and following an online tutorial. I am also disappointed that I have to restart my firestick frequently. It will freeze and only way to get it going again is to unplug and restart. It also frequently supposedly has no internet connection even though it does. I also sometimes cannot get the voice button to work. Restarting temporarily fixes these issues but it tests my patience and I wish it didn’t have these issues. The worst thing is the control refusing to not work. It works when it feels like it. On one of my TVs I turned on the CEC feature and can now use the tv remote instead of the firestick remote which took a while to get use to but at least I can use my firestick now. The firestick remotes are garbage. I have 4 firesticks in my house and one by one the remotes are refusing to function.

"I use this connected to my JBL soundbar 5.1 and EPSON projector using HDMI ARC connection.  Video and sound quality are excelent.  Unfortunately I have to tell that this product is not intended to be used in Latin America since some services like HBOGO app is not working. First, it asks you to validate your tv device in hbogo.com but that site tells you that it doesn't work outside the US and if you try to use a VPN with a US server, then it will ask you for your cable subscription (in the US). So my conclusion is that HBOGO app won't work outside US.  However there's a workaround for this. Just open the HBOGO.com.br latin american site in Firefox app and play your movies and series from there (you'll have to figure out how to show desktop version of the site, not mobile or it will ask you to download HBOGO app).",3,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0

So, if you are a Stick fan I would recommend it due to the added volume controls if for nothing else.",4,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I'm not rating this 1-star because the picture quality is great, but there is a 1-2 second audio delay on most every app, including Hulu, Netflix, CNN, and more. At first I thought it was just me losing my mind, then perhaps the television itself. Nope. It's the Fire Stick. This is a pretty epic blunder for Amazon.I never noticed it on my plasma television, but when I upgraded the issue was easy to spot.",2,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0

"I have purchased three firesticks.  I’m not sure why, but always having to uninstall and reinstall apps. Netflix constantly shuts off in the middle of a show. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. Takes FOREVER to do this. It’s been about 40 minutes as of now. Restarted the firestick twice before taking the drastic measure of the uninstall. Internet connection is stellar. Netflix is still downloading and I’ve about lost interest in the show.  My other firestick that I had on this tv stopped working for Netflix too. Always get an error message. Swapped it with the upstairs tv, so no Netflix up there, but now the same thing with my new 4K firestick that I purchased in July 2019. Is that the lifespan of the firestick? Netflix is always pixelating like the digitized view from satellite when there’s a storm. All other apps seem fine. Maybe I’ll try Roku next.",1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,1

Once I got it all set up and running it worked great. I had to use that cable extender thung to get fire to connect to TV.  I have not tried any of the Alexa stuff not sure if I will.  It tied into my Amazon account.  Finally was about to re-watch Corner Gas again and pick up some TV apps.  Mat update review if I decide to use Alexa. Just have to figure out all the differnt buttons on the remote and i got the green cover for the remote so we could tell the remotes apart. I think it will be a great experience with the Fire Stick,5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"While I hate the voice activation feature due to security concerns, the unit overall is a huge improvement over the built-in apps in my first gen OLED. Older smart sets are having streaming capabilities slowly being turned off by the manufacturers or just simply refusing to work.  This is due to the new, even stupider and pointless encryption by the streaming folks like Hulu. The plus side to this Fire Stick is the picture quality ... it IS better than the built-in apps probably due to a new chipset and faster CPU. This will give older sets a longer life for people who really use the streaming functions. For me at least, it was worth every penny and I'd gladly buy it again.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"I have been using all of the major streaming hardware providers for the past 4 years and have found that the best and highest value product continues to be Amazon's.  Apple is great but very expensive, especially with Airplay 2 being included in many TVs now, and Roku, while good, still has a slower interface for the major streaming services, and currently does not support AT&T TV Now.  Amazon's services, price, and quality remain competitive, and the user interface, while biased towards Prime, still is useful, fast, and the streaming quality is very good.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

The remote is slightly larger too (love the larger remote.  It's harder to lose).

"if you are planning on running this on the 2.4GHz you should be fine, however if you plan on taking advantage of the faster speeds of the 5GHz band you will most likely need to have it run on  channels between 36 to 48 or 149 to 165, I noticed really slow speeds a ton of lag and buffering as well as the firestick dropping internet all together, changed the channel and it works greatI would also like to add that with the layout of my HDMI ports I was using the included HDMI extender, noticed I was not able to stream in 4k so after researching all possible solutions I decided to remove the extender (which cost me an HDMI port) and this thing immediately began streaming 4k",4,1,2019-12-8,1,1,0
"We have owned fire TV boxes for quite a few years. We decided to make the move to UHD and found that our fire TV’s would not support these features.  We decided to try out the new UHD compatible Fire Stick. We ordered it and it arrived in two days. Setup was quick and easy.  We immediately started streaming UHD content from Prime, Disney+ and HBO.  The response and streaming is much faster than the older Fire TV’s and picture quality is awesome.

"Seems like a yearly ritual but we pick up some new Fire sticks every Black Friday (this one for $35) We've had all from the 1st gen to this and this one seems to best performer out of the box. The first 2 gens (especially the 1st) seemed to have started off lagging the moment you boot them up. Although I haven't tested this in 4k yet (since our current 4k smart TV is performing well) there seems to a much clearer 1080p picture quality compared to the second gen as well. Not to mention more apps support a solid 60fps for streaming as well (we use PS Vue and it wasn't possible before) My only guess is that the apps (Netflix/Youtube etc.) may be streaming a higher 1080p bit rate that the old one couldn't handle.As for the remote, I'd have to say it's close to perfect. Having to use one control for power/volume is definitely a Quality of Life improvement. Although you can't change inputs with it, it's perfect for those bedroom TV's that only have 1 device attached. Not to mention it seems to have alot less input lag compared to the last gen (although that may be due to the new fire stick instead) Alexa responds with almost no noticable delay no matter what youre doing on there.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
"I bought this as a replacement to a super old 2nd gen Fire TV stick we rarely use in our guest room.  It was super fast compared to the old one, it even allowed us to turn off and on the tv and control the volume as well.

I love Prime Video and Disney+ which I pay for per annum which is easy.  There are so many great series and original films to watch and the Fire Stick allows us to enjoy streaming these shows.  Our smart TV is a 2015.  Therefore we needed the Fire Stick to allow streaming the Disney+ shows as it requires 2016 or newer.  It works really well but did take a few days and a call to figure out how to make it work with our sound system and receiver as well as our cable.  Well worth the effort.  I love all of the shows now available to us.,5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"I'll caveat this review with:  I haven't tried chromecast.  I do own a 4k Roku.  And THIS one blows the Roku out of the water for functionality.  The built in alexa is a god-send.  It works exceptionally well, and the ease of setup and use is wonderful.  I prefer this over my roku 4k.  The only thing I Think the roku does better is it's easier to search and find proprietary apps, but, honestly, not THAT much easier.  Plus, this comes with an HDMI extender in case it won't fit snugly into your TV (thank you!!) where as the ROKU doesn't and the cord to connect it to the power is VERY short.Fire TV stick ALL THE WAY!",5,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0

The picture is much sharper with particular attention to textures such as skin, etc.  The colors are much more vibrant; most notable with red tones without oversaturation.  The processor performance really shows improvement in the speed in which apps are opened and the interface response.

If I'm lucky, it'll find an existing show or movie that I have regular access to. 95% of the time it cannot accomplish this simple task and will never play the actual episode I requested. I have an easier time navigating through the Smart TV app for Prime Video. Also, you will not be able to use one of your TV's USB outlets to bridge the power supply to the Fire Stick plugged in on an HDMI outlet.

"We have a houseboat. At the marina we have wifi but no cable TV. Dish Network wanted $800 to come out and put a satellite dish on the boat. I tried using my tablet with a casting app to cast what I was watching on the tablet to the TV. The casting app kept interfering with the wifi signal and disconnecting the wifi.  I went in to a mom and pop electronics store in small town TN and explained to them my problem and that I needed to find a way to get what I was watching on the tablet to appear on the TV.  I told them I had tried Chromecast but couldn't use it because it doesn't work with a captive portal (For those that don't know, a captive portal is a web page that the user of a public-access network is obliged to view and interact with before access is granted. You normally have to accept terms of use, provide an email and/or name to use the internet. Captive portals are typically used by business centers, airports, hotel lobbies, coffee shops, and other venues that offer free Wi-Fi hot spots for Internet users.) After a few minutes of research, the techy guy at the electronics store said that Fire Stick has the ability to work with a captive portal so I bought one. Sure enough...he was right! After I put in the marina's wifi password it took me to the marina's home page on a web browser where I could put in my email, name and accept their terms of use.

The only issue we had was that on our Smart TV we have HDMI ports that have the Firestick hanging down, and others that allow it to be parallel and not hang on the dongle. In our experience, hanging from the connector caused it to frequently lose connectivity. We moved it to the horizontal and it works perfectly.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

"I made a mistake buying the 4K Firestick. I'm sure it is fine if you don't have other streaming services. Prior to buying the Firestick, we had a Roku and an two AppleTVs. We have subscribed to Acorn TV for 3 years. That in addition to Amazon Prime gives us all we want in streaming programs. We are not interested in Netflix, Britbox, HBO, Hulu, or Sling. We are PBS aficionados, donating to our local public TV/radio every year. So, I wonder whether anyone else can use our activated Firestick for themselves it is it a dead piece of electronics.",4,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
I love the fire TV 4K stick.  I don’t like the bloatware. Not enough memory. Download around 3 apps and it’s completely full.Has a lot of unnecessary programs running all the time. If you hack it and stop the processes with an outside program it will run very fast.,4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I love having a fire stick. It's so much nicer watching my shows on the TV rather than on my phone. It was incredibly easy to set up, and took maybe 5 minutes (that includes putting the batteries in the remote lol). Everything is easily accessible and it comes with clear instructions once it's set up on how to navigate it. The reason I knocked off a star. I bought this product about 6 months ago, and the remote quit working. I probably could have found a warranty for it, or just purchased another remote. But we've moved since then and I didn't want the hassle. Especially considering how reasonably priced it is. 10/10 would recommend",4,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"Purchased from Best Buy on Jan 5, 2019.  Was working fine, then all of a sudden the audio will drop every so often.  Aside from that, audio sync issues also occur (not often, but they occur).  To remedy the audio sync issue, I would have to rewind or restart the program or restart the app.To try and remedy audio drop issues I have tried new, Amazon brand hdmi cables with no success.  Using the provided USB power adapter doesn't fix it.  Restarting the 4K fire tv stick DOES NOT fix it.  Changing wifi from 5Ghz to 2.4Ghz DOES NOT fix it.  Restore to factory DOES NOT fix it. My two 2nd gen fire tv sticks DO NOT have this issue but why would I use a non-4K streaming device on a 4K display?",1,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0
"I have had trouble for years with streaming in the back master bedroom. My NYC apartment isn't huge so I have always been baffled. I have tried an extender - no improvement. I then wired ethernet cable from the router, through the hallway closets around doorways to the bedroom directly into the extender, expecting that the router being wired might help - no luck. I was settling with the idea that watching tv in my bedroom was a gift, luxury or a surprise - lucky if you get it. I read reviews that this 4K firestick can help improve performance even if you do not have a 4K television (which I definitely do not). With the half off offer from amazon, I figured why not try it. I am so glad I did and wished I would have earlier. I never knew it could be so great - actually being able to watch tv in my bedroom :) After being denied consistent service for so long, this is truly a delight. I click and things move so fast. I am able to navigate faster than in the living room which still has an older model fire stick, but is right near the router. I can stream shows and movies with no problem or buffering at all. We are considering upgrading the living room now. If you are having trouble with streaming, do not hesitate to get this fire stick - even if it is back to full price - it is worth every penny.I had the new 4k stick for a couple days and just was too lazy to install it immediately. My last straw was when I woke up to the old fire stick giving me the familiar no connection message and when I went to scan for available networks it said my router and the extender was not in range. Out of frustration I said let me just install the new 4K. It connected with no problem while the old one couldn't even find my router in range. Bonus - it connected to my soundbar without a problem either, so I can put that extra remote away and control the volume as well with my great new 4k remote. The voice command works as needed as well. I will never look back. This was the best purchase ever!",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"So far it is working as advertised.  The voice recognition was very easy to setup.  It was also easy to pair with the TV so it can be turned on and off with the remote.  It does not come pre-loaded with the apps like the Roku or Smart TV's, etc.  You have to find the app you want and then download it.  So far I only have Amazon and Netflix but when I get time I plan to download a few others.  I like it and am glad I finally bought one.  Was waiting for the Black Friday sales but got this a few days early for the same price.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

"I had to get this fire stick because my last fire stick was very slow and would crash on a daily basis. I got this one because I read it was supposed to be very fast, which it is. But, when watching shows/ movies on it, no matter if it is off Hulu or Netflix etc, the audio doesn't match up with the picture half of the time. I have to unplug the fire stick and plug it back in constantly to get the audio to match up again. It's disappointing that I am already having this problem and I've only had this fire stick for a couple days. I would not recommend.",2,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"I love it, it can stream everything I would want a streaming device to stream and more! That being said, there is one major drawback. This device has major sound syncing issues. While it may have something to do with the fact that the audio is being passed through my TV via optical cable to a soundbar, I feel like this is a fairly common audio solution. Not a single one of my other devices has this sort of issue. The sound delay can be upwards of 3 to 5 seconds (plays sounds then x amount of seconds later the lips move on screen). Im sure there's a fix for this (haven't found one yet in my 40ish minutes of research), but I feel like a product shouldn't have to be messed with to get up and running unless the packaging says so, hence the 3 stars overall.",3,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
Works great but I noticed that it used more bandwidth on the network then other devices that stream video. Not sure as to why that is but it can have some difficulty streaming of anything else is online at the same time depending on your internet speed. For the most part it’s pretty easy to use and the Alexa integration is good and works for smart home devices only when the device is powered on and you push the button on the remote. I also like that it’s comes with a usb brick since the tv I have it connected to in the bedroom is smaller and doesn’t have a USB port on it. The settings menu is kind of a pain depending on what you’re trying to do though and it’s not apparent how to close out an app if it freezes up and needs to be restarted.,5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0

"We have had two Fire TV Stick 4K for 7-8 months. We like the video and audio quality, we enjoy X-ray, and the ability to control associated devices (TV, sound bar) with a single remote. TV control (Sony and Panasonic) has been flawless, but the control of a Panasonic Sound bar is hit or miss in terms of its ability to turn on/off (we often end up having to use the sound bar remote to turn it on). Volume control of the sound bar is fine. Tweaking the settings has not improved the reliability of the on/off feature.The user interface is OK. It is however far less intuitive than the Apple TV interface. It requires more clicks to access the same content and it is a lot less clean. Also, the existence of multiple ways to access the same services is confusing. For example you can subscribe to Showtime's streaming service through Prime Video Channels or through the Showtime streaming app, but they are not linked to each other. If you subscribe to Showtime through Prime Video Channels you have to access the shows though the Amazon Prime Video app. There may be a way to use the Prime Video Channel subscription to watch showtime on the showtime app, but I have not found it. On Apple TV this is more or less seamless. You can subscribe to Showtime through iTunes, but then you use the Showtime app for streaming, as if you had subscribed on the showtime site. It is not a huge difference, but just less convenient watching and tracking your subscriptions on the Fire TV Stick 4K.",3,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"We have an older Sony TV and got notifications that our TV would no longer support streaming Netflix or Amazon Prime.  Had to do something and decided to try this Fire Stick.  We are very pleased.  It was easy to get working and is very user friendly.  When we're watching TV on our HDMI 1 input from our cable company, I can press and hold the Alexa button on the remote and ask her to pull up Mrs. Maisel on Amazon Prime and she does just that.  She switches to the right HDMI input and pulls up the show.  Also, when the grandkids were over and wanted to watch a kids show, I found it on the Firestick but we had to have a subscription to Noggin, a kids TV subscription service.  Right there on the screen I could purchase the free week of that service and the kids were watching within minutes.  I like it more than  I thought I would!  I would recommend it for others in our situation.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

I find the Fire Stick to be faster, provide a better picture and sound, and eliminate all the updates that were occurring on the Samsung TV.

Read the 1 star reviews and saw a lot of people with Samsung TV's stating the 4K stick doesn't work with Samsung. Well it's true, it doesn't. Stuck my old fire stick in and it booted right up, ready to use, just won't do anything without a remote. A new fire stick system is cheaper than replacing the remote by itself.

Our only issue is that we had to upgrade the audio connection between the TV and our Bose system to be able to get the surround sound working which for us meant a TOSlink cable and a TOSlink switch because our Bose only has one TOSlink port.

I’m a night own, and I can’t watch programming at night because it wake him up (not the TV) if I am click, click, clicking through Netflix.  It’s not the kind of sound you can turn off.

After the roofers were done, the DirecTV installer said he couldn't get a clear window to the satellite despite our dish being in the same location for 20+ years. I had to come up with an alternate strategy for TV; cable was not an option due to our rural location, so I decided to finally unbox the Fire Stick.

Once I purchased, the shipping time changed to ""July 30 or 31"".  On July 30 I logged into my amazon account and learned that shipping had been delayed, and the actual item did not arrive until Aug. 2.

"This 4K model is so much faster than the one I replaced it with. My older one was really slowing down and acting funny, despite deleting unused apps and junk. I was theorizing it was probably because of how every show, network, or series seems have a preview begin playing automatically. That's a lot of random video to continually access and not access and access and not access as you scroll through things. Older tech wasn't keeping up. BUT THIS THING DOES! VERY VERY WELL! Hardly any delays on anything! Got it on sale to boot, WhoHah!",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"My Fire Stick 4K works flawlessly now.  My only complaint is about the initial installation instructions.  Nowhere in the instructions does it say or recommend a software update before trying to use the device.  I had video freeze up issues until after I ran an update.  This is a common issue in today's electronic devices and I would think Amazon would at least make a mention of an update in the instructions.  Someone who is new to streaming or using this type of device in general may not even consider running an update.  Amazon could save customers a lot of time by just including a step to run an update, or better yet make it automatic on initial power up.",4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0

But then when one night my internet went out or spotty, I tried to turn the stik off & run just the cable TV, but I had made the mistake of setting up all devices to be ran by Alexa & learn that it reverts itself right back to the HDMI devoted to the Firestik, even using the Cox Cable remote. So once the internet was back up, I removed the Cable box from device list, rebooted the Firestik & that won't happen ever again.You can't depend on one remote to control all devices when it's source is the internet...",3,1,2019-2-12,1,0,0
"Got the 4K version even though I do not have a 4K TV.  Why?  Don't want to have to buy it twice if I upgrade the TV itself.  Plugged into my old Samsung 46"" LCD TV (Model LN46A650A1FXZA).  The fire stick set itself up, and works perfectly right out of the box.  No issues at all.  It's a snug fit in the side HDMI-4 port with out the HDMI extender, but it works, so I didn't need it.  Apps install in a breeze.  Only using standard apps, no hacker apps or free illegal streaming apps, proxies or vpn's.  Just normal apps for access to legal streaming sites such as ABC, IMDB-TV, Netflix, Tubi, and more.  Through voice, I can change the inputs on the TV.  Just say ""HDMI ONE"", and it switches the TV.  Controls TV's volume and power too.  Have had absolute ZERO buffering via WiFi.  That was a concern going in.  Thought I might need the Ethernet Adapter....Nope, not in my case.  Should have bought one of these a long time ago..  Highly recommended, and super easy to use.",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0

There are many others for fevery taste.I am sure that a sophisticated  user who knows more about how to construct the ""builds"" could show you things that  would blow your mind.

"I have had this 4K fire stick for about a month and a half and straight out of the box it had been nothing but a problem. Came with dead batteries so I couldn’t even set up the stick because it kept saying batteries were too low. I replaced them with brand new ones and the remote has always had a several second response delay (super annoying). Also it will just disconnect you from network settings over and over if there is an update for the stick but never tells you there is an update, I had to figure out the problem all by myself. And then there is the biggest problem, I pay not only for Hulu but Hulu live and unlimited screens making my Hulu bill like $80 a month but I can’t even use it for more then 5 exact minutes without it force closing because apparently amazon has had problems with their device and the Hulu app for sometime and it just not getting fixed or something but there is no fix that you can do to fix it. I have tried all sorts of stuff and nothing works and lost of other people who use Hulu on a fire stick have posted same problem online for the past year and nothing has been done. I am someone who has 3 echo devices and and another fire stick (not the 4K version) and never have problems other then Hulu also not working on the regular fire stick also so this is a huge disappointment. I would have to say the only cool thing about getting a fire stick is that you don’t really have to sign in to your account and set it up because it’s already linked to your amazon account.

"I would give this zero stars if I could! I am suspicious that they have decreased the quality of this product. Until I started living by myself a few months ago I used by old roommates fire stick that was several years old and it was great. So when I moved, I bought my own. In the last 3 months I have been sent FIVE replacement fire sticks and they have all either been broken when I received them or they broke within only a few weeks of use. My sister bought a fire stick around the same time that I did and has had the same problem. I have officially given up and concluded that the broken fire sticks I received were not a fluke, but this is a genuinely garbage product.

Otherwise it works, like my old one. When I tried it on my old TV, which I bought like 8-10 years ago, which is definitely not a 4K TV, everything worked, even the volume and mute, weird!

This Fire TV Stick is much faster than the original, and the additional features added to the remote (volume control and the ability to turn on\off your TV) are a great bonus. If you are looking for a streaming device that can be easily installed and hidden from view then you should definitely consider this Fire TV Stick. My only major complaint about the Fire TV Stick is the lack of YouTube app, you can browse to it via Firefox and\or Silk (I think these are the two available browsers) but it would be a lot more convenient via an app.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

We have an Echo in the same room already and don't always have the TV on the HDMI input so we were afraid we would have to rename the Echo, but we didn't, since a wake word is not necessary for the voice remote.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
I subscribe to a couple internet channels that aren't particularly common; MotoGP and CriterionChannel and the Firestick has the apps for both of those and I'm a happy camper.

By playing around with it, I set it to a more standard contrast ratio which now makes it look as good or better than broadcast TV delivered by cable.  Stutters/jitters are very rare.  Don't like the Alexa built-in component control because it is set up to work only with the Fire streamer and a TV.  Can't get it to control my AVR  Perhaps, I should take a lesson on Alexa but I'd think saying. ""Alexa, resume playing Bosh n Amazon Prime"" would yield some result...  nothing.",4,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0

Amazon even told me to call Target and LG told me to call Best buy.  Lol I was like - really?  This is a common problem, not just with this TV.  The complaint is all over the net and YouTube.  But in many cases no solution.  This is a problem Amazon should be able to fix.  I tried to explain it to the reps from both companies but of course no real technician on the phone.  Just some body.  And no, I don't think the technician was from the States.  Yes another phone bank in Bangladesh for all I know.  It was very frustrating.  Knowing more about the problem than the actual Amazon agent.  This is a software issue.  A handshake from one device to the other.  I've spent many hours trying to sink this device. Twice.

Mainly, that if like me, you find a great many series & movies you're interested in, and flag them to watch later, you end up with a ridiculously long single row of flagged items. It would really, really help if Amazon would allow customers to create their own categorizations and choose which of those self-created categories to place their flagged watch items in. If Amazon allowed people to do that, it would see how its customers categorize various movies & series, which in turn would help tell Amazon how to best do that themselves. Hint.

Amazon Fire TV Stick is on the leading edge for live local news with apps for CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox affiliate stations across U.S. that are live at time of broadcast morning, midday, evening, late evening with replay by full episode, weather or news segment.  Video/sound quality is excellent.  Navigation easy.  The list of stations in the news app category is extraordinary.  My thanks to TV stations working with Amazon/Amazon Fire TV Stick for this.  And, any station on the list plays in my home in an instant.  +5 stars for optimizing TV sets which extends to optimizing and stabilizing OTA (over the air) live TV from stations 50 miles north and south via Hausbell Indoor HDTV Antennas.  Since OTA does not use internet data, I am enjoying so much more for things I love like Prime Video.

It was a little difficult for me to attach the stick, but I was on a ladder.... and the TV is over a tall fireplace. I called Amazon, answered a few questions and was offered a replacement. It would be in the mail the next day. Hubby came home from work and was able to attach it almost immediately. GRRRRR!  I immediately canceled the new one, but I have to say I am super impressed with the great customer service with no hassles.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
NO Disney + ?!?!?!I have 2 Fire Sticks and I've enjoyed it a lot over the past 4 years even upgrading them as new features arise. But I am ANGRY!! That we are a week out from Disney + (Disney Plus) becoming a new streaming service and Amazon is holding out for more money than putting Disney plus in their App Store! I am getting ready to make a new purchase and swap over to Google so I can watch all the new STAR WARS/ MARVEL / & DISNEY SHOWS FOR MY KIDS!! I have already signed up for 3 years of Disney plus and will give up my fire stick for google if this is not remedied fast!!,1,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I like the new Fire Stick because the remote will turn the TV off and on and you can adjust the volume! Don't have to use both remotes anymore. With the old fire stick I had to turn on TV and adjust the volume with the TV remote. Then I did everything else with Fire Stick remote. Now everything with one remote, its great!",5,1,2018-11-12,1,2,0
"My device is 9 months old and beginning to fail in the exact same manner as my Gen2 did. Customer support sucks. If the device is in another room and it takes you more than 3 minutes to get the info they want they disconnect the chat and you have to start over. I gave at the beginning of the 3rd time. Before that there was was different excuses given by the agents and different troubleshooting paths followed...for the exact same issue.The issue is that, just as my Gen2 did, it has begun to not connect to my my wifi intermittently. They wanted me to check my connections (as If I hadn't already), then ISP's router for updates (as If I hadn't already), then just boot the router (as If I hadn't already), on, and on. Tired to blame it on the stick needing an update, even though my other 4k stick needed the same update but wasn't displaying the same issue. I fully expect that this one will fail sometime after a year and I will have to purchase something to replace it, the same I had to do with my Gen2.",2,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"I am having some difficulty with the way it interacts with my TV.  I do not have a cable hooked up and it is only for movies and other features.  Once I got it working on the Fire Stick remote, the TV remote was unnecessary. Then I added a USB thumb drive to see if I could play an MP4 video. That worked then I couldn't get back to the original installed Fire Stick as the Fire Stick remote and the TV remote switched places.  I haven't a clue how to get it back working and when I do get something, I do not have the ease of selection.  I'm a Senior Citizen and don't always understand what is going on.

I gave up on the firestick and started using FireTV devices because they seemed faster and more efficient for my needs.  I am 100% cable free because of these devices.  This firestick 4K has worked great in the 1st week that I've had it.  It controls the volume and power on the TV which is great.  I give this device a big thumbs up since I've been using them since the first on came out.  I don't think you will be disappointed.,5,1,2018-11-13,1,2,0
You know the government cares about what you watch on TV so why have you not helped them out by speaking it into the voice command. Truth be told I love the dang thing. Works awsome with my 4K it is clear as can be AND easy to set up and run. Recommend when you get things like Disney + and so on DO IT THROUGH THE APP! trust me it is the better deal. So now you got your tv snack and drink tell her what you want to watch and there you go. don't worry the NSA has seen Vikings like a billion times by now....and baby Yoda,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

With the first one it got into some kind of loop and I couldn’t even get as far as selecting my WiFi before the device would reboot it self. Called customer service and they said to send it back in. Now with the second one the device constantly reboots when I am setup my Amazon account. I have both the original Fire Tv and the original Fire TV stick and they still work great. Very disappointed.

This is the first time I have written a review where I had to give 1 star.  Would give less if possible.  Tried 2-4K versions of the stick and 1 2nd Gen version.  None have worked on 3 different TVs.  Not sure if the problem is me or the sticks or my system.  Would raise the rating if I could get one to work.  Watched many YouTubes and searched web and could fine no solution.  At this point have to assume the product is the problem.-Tried another from Best Buy (4K Versions and it worked).  I will change the rating to 3 stars.  Sending back the one I received from Amazon.  The Amazon Tech was very helpful in getting confirmed that the Best Buy one worked and the Amazon one did not.,3,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0

Lately it isn't connecting with our Netflix app on my phone. Me and the hubby watch one show each night together before we go to sleep. At any rate, we was unable to do that. And since this is our wind down time, I decided to give this a shot. And I no longer need to use my phone while watching tv. (Did I mention we dumped cable?) All of my apps are now downloaded onto our firestick and I no longer have to worry about connectivity issues. So yeah, I kinda really love having this.

I was able to sync this with the Sony soundbar as well and it is able to perform the on/off and volume. The interface is very fast, games load faster and movies look great.My only complaint is it kind of broke my Alexa to Harmony setup, as it seem to not like the word “TV” anymore. I just renamed my harmony controlled TV as “DVR” and “Television” now I can have Alexa turn on the TV with those words without any problems.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0

The 4K Firestick has opened up a new world of entertainment for my family.  The majority of viewings are free and there are so many different genres from which to choose.  It is easy to hook up to the TV by just plugging in the USB cord.  All programs indicate if they are free or have a charge to watch.

"I have been used to using my PlayStation 4 and Roku when streaming TV. PlayStation 4 is the absolute worst, the controller always makes you push fast forward or rewind on accident. I got so sick and tired of that. On top of that what is the worst thing about PlayStation is that is always updating, so you might be tired from work all day and you just want to sit down and watch TV but guess what, you have to do automatic mandatory update which is very, very frustrating. My Roku for my bedroom is a little bit better but still really as an ugly interface that bothers me. Finally pulled the trigger on the fire stick and I tell you what is so much better then them both.

"UPDATE: I’ve had this fire stick about 9 months, and it broke during month 8. It’s completely undetectable by my TV now (shows up as no input), and I’ve tried a bunch of online solutions that did not work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO FORK OUT $50 MORE FOR A NEW ONE LESS THAN A YEAR LATER. I called amazon about getting a replacement, and they would not. I asked what they suggest I do to avoid spending $50 every 9 months, and they said to buy an extended warranty. You shouldn’t need an extended warranty within a year of purchase.... usually amazon has good customer service, so I’m shocked I could not get a replacement.I bought the fire stick because my smart TV constantly lagged and took forever to buffer tv shows/ movies. The first three weeks using this product were great -- there were no lags, Alexa works so well, there's a lot of neat features, and it had Disney+ (My smart TV did not). Close to the month mark, whenever I turn my TV on the fire stick does not show up, it's just a black (but turned on) screen. The only way to get the main menu to show up is to 1) unplug the fire stick and plug it back in, or 2) change inputs on my TV then change back to the fire stick. Both of these are super annoying, and this should not be happening only 1 month into using it. I will likely be returning this product.",1,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

Then I started watching various videos on what it can do and it sparked me buying an Echo Dot 3, paring was a breeze by the way, and I have a 2nd Echo Dot arriving shortly so I can play music in stereo. But, movies, live TV through apps like Pluto (free), Tubi TV (free) and Hulu along with the vast selection through Prime video has kept me joyously entertained as well as learning to use Alexa to the max potential.",5,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0
"This does what you would expect a firestick to do, the reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is when it initializes an automatic software update, you can be on a different source input on your tv and it will disconnect you from your input to the input the firestick is on only to notify you that it's running a software update. If I wanted to use the firestick I would have already had my input set to that, it should perform the updates without changing my input",4,1,2018-11-19,1,1,0

"I own 4 other app platforms but decided to give the Amazon Fire Stick 4K a try since it was on sale for $24.99. I received it today and installed most of my apps to it. I was VERY disappointed when I could not find the VUDU app anywhere for download. After then researching on the internet why, it appears there is NOT a VUDU app for the Amazon platforms. WHAT?! REALLY?! WHY?! I have my Amazon account connected to my Movies Anywhere account and my Movies Anywhere account connected to VUDU. I have almost 500 movies in my VUDU account but only just over 400 show up in my Movies Anywhere account. Therefore, I only watch my movies through my VUDU app account. This was a BIG bummer for me. Also, I watch TV with the AT&T TV NOW app. There is some lagging or stuttering with the picture with the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K that is not a problem with the other 4 platforms I use with my other TV's. I also hate the Fire Stick's HOME screen. It shows you everything that the Prime Video app shows you, so why have it on your HOME screen. I like my HOME screen to be all of my apps that I have downloaded. With this Fire Stick, If you want to see all your apps on one screen you have to hit ""VIEW ALL"" beside the line of apps on your HOME screen. Too much to go through!!

State of the art Amazon did a great job on this one,and super easy to get up and running, nice remote too...",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"Try another streaming stick if you want something that will last at least two years. This is the second Fire Stick I bought because the first one was working so well. HOWEVER, after around one and a half years, the Fire Stick started having streaming problems and the remote then broke. I replaced it with a Roku streaming stick. So far, so good. I was hoping that was just a fluke as I have had no problems with other Amazon-branded items (batteries, a mouse). Unfortunately, this stick is now having streaming problems, primarily on a few specific apps (CBS All Access seems to be the biggest problem). Replacing this with a Roku streaming stick as well and hoping for more longevity with Roku.",2,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0

"Over the past year I have purchase several New Generation Fire TV Stick 4K. My overall review is the quality is great from a design standpoint, performance is at the highest level compare to other media products, the added new features was just what the new generation Fire TV Stick 4K needed, great price, etc. The new generation Fire TV Stick 4K is very user friendly compare to other controls on the market.Overall performance is a 5 Star.

"Is OK. After reading lots of reviews, researching, I was simply expecting a bit more available. Perhaps not Fire TV stick's fault, per se, as cable obviously still strictly controls what we're can see. Meaning I try to sign up to watch a particular station and am asked to enter my cable company's password info. Well, that's why I cut my cord, to get away from cable. Why would I want Fire if I also need a cable account?",3,1,2019-5-9,1,1,0
"As a long time user of Apple TV I was kinda skeptical getting a fire stick.  I recently bought a new place a now I have more TV's around the house, and I didnt want to spend $150+ on an apple tv box.  I've used Roku sticks in the past but always threw them away because they were clunky and slow.  I'm blown away with the new Fire 4k stick I just received, it does everything my apple tv does (except airplay) at a FRACTION of the price.  Its super responsive and fast and I haven't run into any issues with the remote not working.",5,1,2019-7-18,1,1,0
"You get asked to provide a review for almost every product you get, and I ask WHY? I have friends who have Firestick and word of mouth is the reason I went with it. I honestly do not pay that much attention to online reviews because how do you know they're truthful? Well reality is you don't!.....I can say based a what a few friends told me the installation and use were on par with what I expected. I had a perfectly viable TV that had no connectivity options. I am a prime member and get HBO through Amazon so it worked as advertised.....I did have issues relative to connecting the audio output of my sound system, but that was more about hardware unrelated to the Firestick. Bottom line it works well, but note that I have a very good internet connection.",4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

On the second day I accidentally used the TV remote instead of the included fireTV remote, and I didn't even notice for 20 minutes! The fire stick was correctly responding to the navigation of the TV remote as if it were made for it. In addition, the Fire stick is very well integrated with Alexa and other Alexa devices. There is pretty much no setup and it will just work, i.e., you can ask an echo device to play a certain show on your fire stick and it'll work. The most useful feature I've found is to ask Alexa to skip forward 2 minutes, or rewind 30 seconds, etc. Great for skipping intro songs and recaps, or replaying something you didn't hear.Alexa can also turn on my smart TV (and the connected fire stick) by just being asked to.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

After about 20 attempts on 3 separate TV’s i reached out to amazon. They were zero help. Telling me to do a factory reset and to unplug it. Non of which worked, especially since I couldn’t get passed the initial set up. After some time we called it quits and asked for a refund.",1,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0

My TV will turn on and show the logo and will then go off and the volume button will have the red light on it instead of the  off and on button.

That said, I really love it!  My 2011 Sony 55HX729 is barely a smart TV, and I was never able to get Netflix and Amazon Prime audio to route through my home theater system.

I just wish the remote responded to “Alexa” commands without needing the remote in hand. It also doesn’t seem to be working with our dot which I thought was part of the features.

Plus I have xumo, tubi, and Pluto for free tv. It really is a lot of choices and the fire stick 4k handles all of it quite easily. The streaming quality and speed is great. No buffering on any playback and and the video looks great. The Alexa control works fast and easy as well. I do notice that she doesn't recognize channels within Philo, though.

"Bought the 4k fire stick for a new TV.  Worked fine for about 4 months, then started turning itself off constantly.  Changed location for more ventilation/less overheating, swapped between plugging it into the wall for power, TV usb for power, different televisions altogether, but nothing fixed it.  Googling the issues reveals a lot of forum posts, questions, etc of people facing the same types of issues with the 4k sticks.  Limped along for about a month with reboot issues until it became permanently stuck at the 'FireTV' boot screen.  Directions to factory reset from amazon did not work, as the stick appears to be unresponsive.  We have an older Fire TV box that has lasted for years and still is going strong.  The stick appears to be much more cheaply made than the box, and I cannot recommend it at all.",1,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0

The voice control with the ability to say things like, ""Alexa, search YouTube for Pink Floyd"" is awesome.

I had to disconnect the device.  I had bought others that were on sale at Best Buy.  I replaced the dictatorial stick with a new one hoping that perhaps the one that had gone bad was an anomaly.  To a lesser degree, the same problem developed.  I had to disconnect that one too but I am hoping that when I want to stream I can reconnect it for that purpose and it will work.  I have no plans to plug this stick in and forget about it - it has taught me that is not a good idea.",2,1,2019-7-13,1,1,0

This one is much more responsive and is able to pull in a good picture with our low bandwidth. My kids appreciate the voice recognition, so you don't have to type. The big downer is we have this Amazon game controller which we used with the last one, and we were excited to use it with this one, expecting the games to be much more responsive, but it DOESN'T WORK!

"Even though Sony no longer supports many of this TVs features, I don’t want to buy a new tv and I definitely will not pay a huge cable bill when I only want just a few select channels, Fox News (non-biased), Netflix for the kiddos and HBO Now. After researching how to get these channels for little or nothing, I was skeptical that the Fire Stick 4K would be the key  or that it would have such a positive visual effect on the TV since it’s already a smart HD TV. But, for the low cost it was worth finding out and joining the low cost F&F program. Well, I am very happy with the results. The Fire Stick was so simple to install. I followed the directions and it was up and ready to download apps within minutes. I did use the extender and tucked it behind the tv. The Home page is so much more user friendly than before. I can even easily customize it and move icons in the order I want them to display. The voice command on the remote works very well with Alexa as well as for populating programs and executing tv functions such as volume and on\off. There are also many more downloadable program options than before.  Some are free and some are not. And the best part?  I am able to pay for just the tv programs that I watch and I was very surprised and super happy to see that the tv screen resolution is noticeably much better and the color is much more vibrant.

"I purchased this a while ago and do not regret it. It's as good in all ways as my 2nd Gen FireTV and better in many others. The ability to control other componentry (sound and on/off) is awesome. The picture is great. I play straight through my receiver and it worked perfectly...until it didn't. I noticed one day that I was only getting a 1080P picture on my new Vizio Quantum pq65-f1 TV. Working through some gremlin, I think I had switched ports and forgot to switch the new port to UHD. When I recently did so, no picture! This had never happened on my previous set (Vizio M60) which was also a 4K set. So, after a lot of detective work, swearing, new cables, irritated Denon (receiver manf) techs, considering sending my receiver back, etc., I finally found the problem. Probably when I was working through that early gremlin, I had turned on Vizio's ""Quick Start"" in order to use Voice Search (aka Alexa) on the 4K Firestick. I now know this TV setting causes tons of 4K ""handshake"" issues including my black screen (not connected). Turning off UHD on the TV will allow allow most functions, but HDR/4K/Dolby Vision will not work through Fire Stick or other sources! Hitting voice search will also send it do different inputs on my TV and receiver for extra joy.I would still buy the Fire Stick 4K, but really wish it wouldn't have taken the detective work to fix.",4,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0

IMDB TV content is free, though with adds, which is fine by me.

"Out of the several options, I selected Amazon's Fire TV stick due to the fact that it was the only option compatible with DISH Network's DISH ANYWHERE app.  My daughter was going to get a TV in her bedroom for Christmas and I didn't want to pay DISH for another box and I didn't want to run wires.  DISH has an app that allows me to view my DVR & subscribed channels on a computer, so it only made sense that a smart TV would be able to access this app.  Unfortunately, the Roku & Google Chromecast do not.  I purchased two of these with went into use on Christmas.  They work great.  This is a major, and easy step for an old guy like me.",5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0
"Definitely a great improvement on the fire stick,  I will probably buy the another one next time it is on sale. I have three fire sticks all of them have some skipping issues.  However they are great products and I couldn’t do with out them.That being said overall this one has much less issues,  I love that they finally put a power switch on the remote.  I wouldn’t mind a bit more room on the stick itself for apps and the like.  I also wish I have the ability to expand the storage Via sd card or USB drive.  But this still doesn’t seem to be an option.",5,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
I recently had to replace an Amazon Fire TV stick device that was at least 10 years old. I decided to try a similar ROKU device just to satisfy my curiosity. I immediately encountered a problem watching HULU with the new device. I reported the issue to ROKU support and to the ROKU user community. Then I discovered that I was not the only one experiencing this issue. After two weeks of neither a resolution or a response from ROKU it was time to end it. My solution was to return to Amazon Fire TV. Things are just fine now.,5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"I bought the new Fire TV Stick 4K 11/24/2019 to use on my new Sony 55"" TV I also bought on Amazon.  Since using the fire stick on the Sony TV, the stick disappears as a selection option on the TV every couple of weeks.  Dead give away is the remote stops communicating with the stick during operation.  The solution I've found is to turn the Sony TV off, unplug power from the fire stick, remove stick from TV and then reverse everything I just did.  I guess it may be some sort of reboot for the stick.  Simply switching Sony TV ports as no affect.  Issue still happens every couple of weeks.  The stick works great otherwise.  I gave a two overall rating out of frustration.  I figure Amazon would sell a better product.  I looked for some sort of customer service on the website to complain to but did not find it.",2,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0

Now there are no wire hookups (except for electricity) to my television. All content is streamed and the Firestick 4K with Alexa voice control is the only remote controller I use.

We have no kids at home, the unit was not abused or dropped and we didn't start using it on our new 5g network until February.I was on the Amazon chat portal that took forever to find and get to and i was passed off to two other service reps until a higher up could help me.  NO communication from the first two reps, one suggested i contact the manufacturer of the Fire Stick!  i had to walk them through that it was barely months old and that it says it can be replaced until Nov 2020.  That took me 4 times to confront them with that date.  They finally acknowledge that and started the process for replacement.

"Initial trials used the readily accessed side-mounted HDMI input #7 on the Pioneer plasma tv.  (This to allow quick FireTV stick removal for off-site viewing of recorded programs.)  The FireTV stick did not directly fit the tv's HDMI input but that problem was solved via use of the supplied extender cable.  Following FireTV on-screen setup instructions resulted in a high quality display of the Home screen.Given I never installed the side-mounted TV speakers (and thus had no sound with the picture), I later moved the FireTV stick to the Pioneer receiver HDMI input #2.  I already had the previous FireTV box connected via HDMI cable to the receiver's input #2, so it would be a simple swap- right?  Well not so fast.  Whereas the earlier FireTV box was equipped with a female HDMI socket that readily accepted an HDMI cable, I now had to join two male HDMI fittings (cable and stick).  An inexpensive HDMI coupling solved the problem.  [Caution: Avoid the more expensive HDMI coupling featuring an amplifier and claiming compatibility with 4K and copy protection standards unless you have more recent home theater system equipment - the TV's HDMI input #4 and screen resolution (1080P) appeared in the header atop the screen but there was no picture display on the screen.]",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0

Because you aren’t required to enter subscription info into separate areas I notice I’m getting better value from my subscription fees! Bonus! The downside MAY be that I’m listening to more TV.

I've unplugged and replugged according to the troubleshooting tips; I've tried the ""select-play/pause"" restart, but the Firestick does not respond (remote works fine, I even changed the batteries to be sure the issue wasn't the remote) and tried googling in case there was another tip online.  all I get is the white screen, with the Fire TV logo and three dots in the lower right that cycle endlessly.update - a day or so after I posted the review above, I got a call from a Seattle area code.  since I don't know anyone in Seattle, I assumed it was a robo call and ignored it.  I immediately got another call from the same number, so I picked up.  it was Amazon.  Amazon called me!  The very nice gentleman told me about another reset method (hold back button and right side of the circular button for 10 sec), which will also cause the Firestick to install updates.  He emailed me the same info and assured me that the unit was still under warranty and could be replaced if the reset/update didn't work.  Unfortunately, the new reset method didn't work, but it's really nice to know that Amazon will stand behind their product.  Thanks Amazon!

Great picture quality, although I am unable to get the TV picture to size correctly so that I get everything in view but I would guess that is due to the age of the TV. While the Alexa integration is nice, I have not really been able to get Alexa to switch shows or open different apps when I ask (also had the same problem with the previous remote that had Alexa).

"Hi. This is a must buy for all types of different features. As a consumer I want effective, simple, and above all affordable. The fact I have two simple choices is amazing. Other like devices have only one option or too many that will make your head spin. I gave it 4 stars for its streaming. I find this device to have way less buffering time or no buffering time at all. It competolitors I have found to be a little more on the slow side. You do have to account for internet speed, THE TYPE OF TV YOU OWN,  and which device you purchased. The stick will stream HD beautifully, but when it comes to 4K it is slow and freezing happens. For 4K viewers the Fire TV is the way to go for beautiful picture quality. Both devices sound amazing with any audio system or even the TV speakers. I gave it 3 stars for voice capability.  Alexa is an amazing system but she is only 5 lol. Dont believe me, just push the mic button and ask her lol. Which brings to the mic button. I love that it is integrated right into the remote, and not available at all or I need some extra hub device that costs more like some of the competitors. The voice recognition does not always work but 90% of the time it does. If it stops working..... Check the batteries lol. I gave the alexa integration 3 stars as well just based on the fact it is new and does need some fine tuning, but they are now integrating Alexa AI systems. So I can see it being amazing in the years to come. I prefer Alexa software to the competitors based on the amount of devices it can connect to. Alexa can even connect to some of the competitors where as the competitors do not connect to Alexa. Also other devices can be linked via bluetooth and you can operate those devices through the Alexa voice system. The new feature I am in love with is the integrated semi universal remote. Previous fire TV and sticks did not this feature. Now i can turn the tv on or off and use volume functions and mute right on the fire stick remote. Also allowing you to use Alexa voice commands to turn up or down. Settings allow you to change the increments as well. Now here's the best part..... even if the tv is shut off and you want to turn it on and look cool by telling Alexa to turn it on..... press the mic button and she turns it on.

After acquiring the DOT and using Alexa I find voice command on Amazon devices much easier to use. I was not disappointed. This Fire TV stick makes it so easy to find the program I want to see.

I have 3 other FTV devices and bought this because A. It does 4K and 2. the remote can control the volume and power on the TV.  The problem is one of the apps I use on it (HDHR for TV) doesn't work correctly and it may have something to do with the MPEG decoder.  My original FTV and my FTV pendant design run the same app with no issues at all.  The other FTV stick I have (non-4K) runs the app pretty well but I think it's just a bit under powered as some channels will pixelate or stutter.

This is an awful product and I should get a replacement, however, the window of return expired after only a month.  I will go back to my Roku, which has worked just fine for 3 years!

"I’ve purchased the Newer “2nd Gen. Fire TV stick 4k” after reviewing specs which claimed 8 Gigs of Storage space (SSPC) on your own web site; and only received one with 5.28 Gigs, with only 3.68 gigs available. I’m no math wiz but doing simple math says that I am cheated out of better than 50% of what was advertised and what I thought I was under good faith purchasing. This is a trust issue to join several I’ve had with you since I’ve been a member and purchasing customer of Amazon; which in fact has been better than 2 years. I would like for you to either send me the 8 gigabytes Fire TV stick 4k or return $10.00 of the $42 + change I spent on it and have you put the true specs on your site. Had I known I would get less than what I expected and paid for, I would have opted to seek another service and TV to purchase as the more apps you add to the thing, the harder it is for it to run, i.e. it runs very slow, freezes and a lot of times changes from a selected program to an altogether unrelated one shortly after a freeze. Please correct this. I think this is fair. Now I’m very Leary of purchasing a TV from you; had Laptops and TV’s in mind; but if I can’t trust they’ll be legitimately operative, efficiently and effectively; I’ll have to stick with Sony, Sharp and Vizio products, and not purchase them through you. Please let me know soon; and that customer rep I spoke with over the phone, and that supervisor should know that if there were actually 8 gigs on the thing, it wouldn’t say there are “3.68 GB of 5.28 GB available” it would show 8 minus the used GB’s; so condescendingly talking to a customer with unrealistic math equations doesn’t negate the actual mathematics facts. But they were polite and that’s something I suppose; but give me what you advertised and I thought I was paying for…..now; as I’d like to purchase a newer model TV now. I’ll need to know if I am ending our relationship in this forum (TV/internet Entertainment); oh. and I understand mistakes are made. I’ve made a few myself; which is why I’m so thorough at paying attention to details. By-the-way, I record all correspondences from everywhere I spend my money; just a legal disclaimer in case anyone wants to challenge me legally where I'm being the victim of fraud. Thank You Amazon The 3 Rating is because My last one worked well for two years; until storage space was almost all used up; that's why the upgrade.",3,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
I bought this for my husband for his birthday on October 20th and he said it was literally the best birthday present ever! He loves to watch the news and  funny movies are his favorite things like that so he was extremely stoked. We have sling and great Wi-Fi service and it works great off of that no issues at all! You do not need sling in order to use this you would only need Wi-Fi or Internet access. You can talk to Alexa on the remote and ask her to find whatever app you're looking for or whatever show U are looking for  or what have you! This was a great buy and I highly recommend it!,5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I owned the original firebox and I had several games on it. I bought this firestick when I moved across the country. I find it easy to use, it was very easy to set up. The remote connected easily. However I cannot play the games I purchased. Amazon stopped making controllers that are compatible when they came out with the firestick 3 (thanks for the heads up amazon). Now instead of having my movies, gaming, and shopping on one device I must alternate devices every time I change tasks. The next item I buy will be a Dell so once again I use 1 device for everything. If you do not use this to play games it is a great device.",3,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
"The only thing that was difficult, that I never did resolve, was that it didn't recognize my sound bar. That portion was not a very good experience. I had to turn off my sound bar for the Firestick function. Now it's Ok working with my TV audio rather than the sound bar; I'm not sure why it didn't pick up my sound bar, even after I indicated the type of sound bar I have. So I just did a work around, which is never optimal.But that being said, everything else was simple to set up, and the voice commands work perfectly.  The picture is great. BTW, after I set it up with the HDMI port on my TV, I added a Blu Ray, and had to put the Firestick and the Blu ray on a HDMI switch, and the Firestick worked perfectly on the switch without any other adjustments.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,1,0
"I didn't want to get a Fire Stick. It seemed ridiculous and superfluous. We already had a smart TV with all the apps so why spend the extra money? When I found out our TV couldn't download certain apps for channels we pay for through cable, I bit the bullet. Sooo glad I did! The picture quality is better, actually making use of our 4k tv, and the apps are great. I have all the apps I could download before AND the missing apps AND more media in general AND better parental controls. Why didn't I get this sooner?! My favorite part is that you have to push a button on the remote to use voice control so Alexa isn't constantly listening.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"This is a nice device that lets your tv become a smart tv. There are a few things I don’t like about it. The batter cover comes off quite easily which is really unfortunate, as this is a legit amazon product and it should be of better quality. I also think the voice recognition is poor. You have to come up with very specific phrases to say to get it to do what you want. Once you learn those it gets easier, but I wish it was just better at voice recognition. Overall it is decent, but there is a lot to improve upon in my opinion.",3,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"The performance of the stick is snappy and responsive, never had a problem with audio and video quality, 4k output is great.Update - the stick is still snappy and responsive. For some reason HDR is awful on the stick, HDR on my native tv apps is perfect, so not a problem with tv. Dolby Atmos' support is now increased, as Disney +, Tidal, and amazon prime (only one series) allows atmos content, but the majority of Atmos titles are on Netflix, which is still not supported by this stick. Also, it's ridiculous that the 2020 fire stick will have atmos support on Netflix titles, but this stick won't.  Hopefully, its updated in the near future.",4,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"I want to start this by saying when this thing works it works very well. When it doesn't it, most of the time it doesn't. I have tried everything on Google to get them working but eventually some apps just won't  get past the intial loading screen, no codes just back to main screen. Some apps have no problems at all. Oddly Disney+ works some of the time where as Netflixs, Twitch, Locast,  the science Channel and possibly others work on original install (post factory reset) then eventually won't work at all. Other apps work fine with no problems at all. I end up using competitor sticks to fill the holes. Great concept, great integration with Alexa, and quite snappy.  Lastly firestick needs to integrate a simple method to clear the ram of open programs. Next time I'm going with a more expensive and more powerful Nvidia Shield.",3,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"This is the third ""Fire Device"" I have bought and each one died just outside of warranty. Picture quality was OK, but the Voice Recognition and ""Alexa Integration"" - simply did not work well enough to be useful. I tried the ""voice features"" with others in the family as well and we all simply laughed at the often ridiculous responses. Breaking down is probably the most dependable feature of these products",1,1,2019-7-17,1,1,0
"Have 4 fire tv devices, including 2 4k stick, 1 none 4k stick,  and 1 older rectanglar 4k version, really like them when they are working. But every of them now lost wifi connection frequently. Was working fine when just bought them, but after few months use, all of them started disconnect after couple hours use and then need to be rebooted in order to connect to WIFI again. Also, have 2 chromecast devices and LG and Samsung tv built-in os, as well as sometimes streaming on xbox, none of them has issue with my WIFI. Almost tried every method to fix it, even tried to re-configure 2.4G and 5G wifi channel as well as assigning static ip instead of dynamic ip on router, still constantly drop connection (usually will drop at least one time every 2 days with about 2-3 hours watching). Did try to reach out to customer support once, but they haven't actually provided any useful solution other than asking if my wifi working correctly, or if device is too far from router, or try rebooting the device... As a software developer, i do know what im doing when setting up device or trying to fix it, but kind of start feeling its a hardware design flaw that amazon aware of but doesn't want to admit. Feels like whenever the device gets hot, it's wifi module will run into connection issue (even with using the included extender). and seems the only way that can fix it is to buy a micro usb network adapter to actually connect to router with ethernet cable. that's so frustrating. the only reason i chose fire stick over chromecast is that it does have a remote and dedicate UI that i can interact with, but frequently disconnected while watching a movie or a tv show is just so annoying. Seriously considering giving other products a try like Roku (i will definitely miss the browser on fire tv os though) or maybe wait for the rumored google new android based product. But really hope amazon can actually fix this issue in their future product (as i don't believe any software patch can solve it after such many os iteration in the past year trying to fix this). It is a nice product with great Alexa integration, but please don't let the defective wifi design ruin the whole experience.",2,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"Solved the problem of older devices no longer supporting apps. Slight learning curve from the TV apps and a Roku but it does what we need. Decent selection of apps. Nice having control of all the devices with one remote. The WiFi is very decent, of course I do use it powered not just USB, and I have just average internet. I also noticed better sound quality, possibly the Dolby Atmos. It has the voice remote which also works with our Echo devices. Keeps my TV going for many more years. Happy so far.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
Gosh!  If only we had known how easy this is to use and how well it works.  We are replacing our Roku with this.  It works well with Alexa and is so easy to use.

We bought 2 of them and wish we would have purchased another couple for family and one for college.,5,1,2019-9-7,1,1,0

"I have tried several iterations of smart TV devices -- ChromeCast, Roku, Tivo, and Cheap Android TV boxes. The 4K Fire TV Stick is the one I'm most happy with. Very easy onboarding. The Alexa remote is easy to use and instantly learned to control my Samsung TV volume and power. Fast interface (no lag) and perfect streaming. I don't have a 4K TV and have mediocre cable internet, but still opted to spend a bit extra on the 4K model. Why? Speed. The better CPU means less laggy menu navigation, which makes everything easier. I am *very* happy with this purchase. Note that I am a Prime member. If you are not, you may like the Fire TV Stick a bit less than I do.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"This works really well!  It's Alexa feature is so FAST and gives lots of viewing options.  The Fire TV Stick itself comes with it's own 'software' that is also blazing fast.  You sign in ONCE to things you subscribe to like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon etc and they are right there at the top.  Though Alexa WILL show you things outside just what you've subscribed to.  The quality is BLURAY and we have a 6 foot wide screen for a 200,000:1 Contrast ration projector!  I like this so much, I bought 2 already, and will probably buy another for the Jacuzzi TV.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
Before I got this I came from Roku. Well I have around 7 Echo devices in my home. So I figured I would give this a shot. At first the only issue I had was I hooked it to my JBL soundbar and had some picture issues but then hooked it to my TV directly and it's been fine. The remote with Alexa works great I can hook up bluetooth to it for TV and I love how everything is sort of in one place. Only complaint though I use Vudu and have alot of movies on there. You have to either side load it or download movies anywhere. Other then that I love this thing! I would never go back to Roku or any other streaming device ever.,5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"This thing is terrible. Also, most electronics have a two year warranty this one is only 12 months. I thought I got a deal on it at 25 bucks. But, it just sat in a power loop no matter the power supply. I forgot about it then I finally looked into the return window and I was over it. They got me with my laziness, arrrghh. Most consumer electronics warranties are at least 18 to 24 months, this has a 12 months return window. It was broken immediately though, never worked well. It would work for up to 30 minutes at the most and then reset in the middle of a game of fibbage, so frustrating. Made me look like a terrible host. I tried it again recently and it just would endlessley power loop. Amazon should make better products and stand behind the ones they do make for longer than 12 months. Makes me want to switch my alexa stuff to google home or apple homekit.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"I have two of these now and really enjoy them. In the bedroom I have an older Vizio television. Vizio dropped support for some of the online streaming programs like Hulu.

It's nice not to have to change input source and just tell the Fire Stick remote to open Netflix and play a series.

Got this mainly because it was on sale.  Disappointed that YouTube tv is not available.  Also configuration for power and volume on display is to single-minded.

"I got this for an elderly family member but it has a really hard time getting her to the right channel. She speaks slowly and eloquently but Alexa sends her to all kinds of not so appropriate channels. Thank goodness she has a sense of humor but buyer beware. Streaming is ok at best but nothing like cable where you can flip channels. Hoping that she adjusts to the new way of watching tv. Any suggestions would be appreciated. She also is using satellite for her internet connection, could that be an issue?",4,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"Ive had a couple of fire sticks one a newest non 4K model that has problems being responsive with too much lag. I had trouble streaming from a plex server running on a desktop with the stream breaking up and becoming unwatchable. I read the 4K model as being the speediest and I think so far it's not given me any problems with lag.UPDATE: reset issues galore. Has stopped playing selected content, requires an unplug and reboot to get it back running. Upgraded to 2.0 amp power supply as recommended without improvement. Will NOT buy a fire stick again.",2,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"Got this for our 4K TV. As with the older model, it's easy to setup and use. The improved remote is amazing with the ability to control the power and volume of the TV. It's the remote we mainly use now. Great picture quality with HDR and noticeably faster UX. As of this review, apparently, Youtube will be coming back to the Fire TV's as an app. To be fair the Silk Browser Youtube experience has been pretty good, but a native app will even be better.This is simply a great device for streaming with tons of support.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,1,0
"I'm a creature of habit and often cringes when things have to change. With this said, I've had my Wii for about 7years now and had the joy of enjoying my Amazon, Netlfix, and YouTube until Jan 31 when I received notice that I wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore. Having been comfortable to watch my movies on my device the news from my Wii just disheartened me. I was sent a promotional email from Amazon, about the disconnect on my Wii, to invest on the Fire TV stick. I was hesitant because I've been so loyal to the Wii and did not see  myself purchasing the Wii U & did not want to brave an entirely new console. Needless to say and countless hours reading review and YouTube videos, I was convinced to purchase the Fire TV stick. Everything you may need or can ever want for a TV, the Fire TV stick can give you and more. The picture resolution makes you feel your watching a smart TV though your TV may be ancient. Very happy with this purchase and Alexa is something I've got to get use to so I'm looking forward to getting to know her.",5,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
"I really was hoping to see a difference between the 4k and the non 4k.  Didn't see it, though.  Also, the bluetooth pairing is not that good, either.  Many bluetooth devices don't connect or pair very well. Also don't like the need to go into to settings every time bluetooth disconnects.  One has to stop what they're watching, go to the home settings, then choose BT control settings, then click on the device to turn on or off.  Then, you have to go back to the home button, click on the app, then click on what you were watching.  Seems a lot of steps for something so simple.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
I was in the process of cutting the cord from the big communications system I had for over 20 years and decided to try the Firestick per recommendation of a friend.  She had been using it for about 3 years and told me there would be a learning curb to use but overall very satisfied with being able to see movies and tv shows.  I just hooked it up on Friday and today is Monday.  So far so good.  Had no problems following instructions and hooking it up.  Fairly simply to do within a few minutes...most of the time was getting familiar with the remote and how to find things.  Look forward to exploring all the features as I get adjusted and seeing a savings to my cable bill.,4,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"I've had several Fire Sticks over the past few years, all of which had to be replaced due to planned obsolescence on the part of the manufacturer. All of them eventually ended up snails or quit working completely. Even after performing all tricks to speed them up. This new 4k I'm sure will be no exception. I'm using this fire stick with a Samsung 4K TV . Working fast as can be right now with one exception. Every time you give it a voice command it's switches HDMI ports on the television. Plug the old fire stick in and you don't have that problem. Plug the new one back in, give it a voice command it switches HDMI ports, and you have to pick up the TV remote and reselect the HDMI port your firestick is plugged into. Also doesn't like to wake up every time after putting it to sleep. Actually I had problems getting this thing to work properly when I first plugged it in, but eventually it straightened out. Could have something to do with it switching the TV's HDMI ports. I just purchased this thing a couple of weeks ago, and now I have to decide whether or not I want to go through the trouble of sending it back and trying another 4K stick.So.... how would I sum this up, typical consumer product, which does exactly what it's designed to do very well.

"I have built-in Pandora and Netflix on my LG Smart TV.  It takes a few clicks to get to it on the remote, and the video pictures on the screen for the clips advertising the music and movies were hard to see and of inferior quality.  With the Firestick, one click does it all and Alexa takes care of the rest.  HD type screenshots and high-quality sound.  Also, with the LG Smart TV, Pandora would only play for about ten minutes and then stop.  Not so with the Firestick.  With Netflix, I can just say ""back up 30 seconds"" and it will, much easier than trying to manually back up.  I love the Firestick!",5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
"My old Roku streaming stick was showing its age (slow response time, no volume control like the new ones). Bought a new Roku stick and was so disappointed (I think it had an internal fault), I sent it back and got the Firestick. Response time is instantaneous, and I figured out how to make the volume control work with my soundbar (it has an optical connection to the TV, which the Firestick couldn't directly control). I used a connector from the TV's headset port to the soundbar's audio jacks, and now the TV sound goes directly to the soundbar.Very happy with this product.",5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0

"After purchasing the Amazon Firestick 4K which was jailbroken I realized if your tech savvy no need to pay the extra $50.00 just download your own apps, and you will have a custom stick made to your specifications. It takes some getting used to and quite frankly some of the apps on the firestick were no longer supported so I had to download new ones and customize the stick anyway. Trying to stream made me realize my internet se up wasn't strong enough to handle what I was about to try. So I upgraded my internet and now have download and upload speeds of 80 mpi and I can download and  stream anything within a minute. You will find that the KODI app everyone raves about is a bit clunky and doesn't load as fast as some other apps like Pluto TV, Bee TV, or Typhoon TV. For live TV I use Xumo TV, along with local tv station apps so I can get local channels and news and for national news like NBC, CBS, I use Xumo TV. If you are trying to cut the cord like me and move away from expensive cable bills this will help. Although it has taken me about a week to get used to using the app and learning all of the ins and outs of the apps. I do like the stick. I have had to download about 5-6 apps to get what I want but that is the beauty of the stick you can customize your experience and make it what you want it to be and will never be as seamless as cable tv but some of the apps are real close like Xumo TV, and Pluto TV. I am glad I made the purchase and will be shutting down my Direct TV in about 30 days. If your noT tech savvy there will be a learning curve and you may need to enlist the assistance of a friend, but overall once you learn how to use the product you will be overwhelmed with the choices that are out their for television shows and movies you can watch. Some developers stop supporting apps so you will need to constantly be checking for the latest apps to see what is the best but your efforts; and you will be rewarded.

I was sick and tired of the slow streaming through a Sony dvd player, whose software wasn't updated for several years. I wanted some new apps. A Black Friday deal where you got both the 4kFireStick and an Echo for under $50 enticed me to give it a try. I just unplugged the dvd from its USB port and plugged in the FireStick. It was easy to set up. The streaming is fast, unbroken, no dropouts or freezes. Sharp video. All this time I thought it was my WiFi and intenet speed, but it was the device that was so slow.

Alexa does not understand English very poor speech recognition. Alexa wants me to watch Netflix movies. I do not want nothing to do with Netflix. This Alexa takes me to this site instead of Amazon prime movies. If you put it on pause when you return it has gone to something else and I can never get my movie buys. Rather used my new TV to operate Amazon more simple and if I want to use another site that’s my choice not Amazon.,1,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
"YouTube TV is not supported.  Researched this and it looks like Amazon and Google are fighting thus, no YouTube TV on the Fire Stick.  Its not right that you are keeping this off of your streaming device.  I wish I knew you were broiled in a ridiculous fight with google before buying three fire sticks and two fire tv units.  Rendered mostly useless without YouTube TV, as now I have to use a different device for my main streaming service.",1,1,2019-5-14,1,2,0

"The fire stick is a convenient and easy way to view shows/movies and access numerous streaming apps. The installation process was straightforward and simple, and truly all that is required is an applicable television unit, wifi, and subscription to your favorite streaming services like Amazon prime, Netflix or Hulu etc... The voice powered search is a nifty add on too, but you do need to be holding the remote and pressing the button while you speak. Overall, I'm really pleased with this purchase and have no complaints!",5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
"We have a smart TV but have been having problems with apps not streaming properly. Had Direct TV out several times and they found no problems, also worked with Samsung and they said no problem with TV. Direct TV finally sent out a tv repairman and they said the apps that are prebuilt in smart TV's are poor and can cause lock up and voice lagging problems.

"Worked great until I switched from the $40.99 plan to the $11.99 plan. Now it buffers or can't load. You also cant get all the network channels ( nbc, CBS) without paying a subscription price to the network. Also 95% of the shows available to watch in the $11.99 plan are anywhere from 1 to 3 years old. Since unless you've not ever watched a show from the beginning you're in luck. Otherwise like me you'll be switching back to the$40.99 package. It's definitely a huge step up in price from direct TV ($93.00). I will keep it. Just keep in mind you do get ""what you pay for"". But, it's worth the money to upgrade.",3,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0
"Lots of great apps available that are not available on other platforms. But also a few apps I use are not available on the firestick like spectrum tv. The 4K is very nice and this device is very good with sports.

"It's bigger than our previous Fire Stick, so it sticks out from the TV edge more. It seems to work well and quickly. Remote is OK, voice control seems gimmicky so far (it starts the search when you hold a button, but then you have to use the finger controls to complete selections so it's only useful for the middle part of your find-a-show experience). Image quality on our 1080P Vizio seems the same as the previous Fire Stick. Best effect so far is it also tuns the TV on and off so we don't have to look for the Vizio remote as often.",4,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0

"Upgraded to the 4K Fire Stick to match the 4K Television.  More responsive than the previous generation and the dedicated mute and volume buttons on the new remote is much welcomed.  In comparison, I would like the remote to have a touch surface like the Apple TV and less buttons but definitely an improvement from the last generation.  Highly recommend for anyone needing a 4k device at this price point.  Space saving design as it will be connected via HDMI and hanging on the rear of your TV versus taking up space on your tv stand.  This device is a great stocking stuffer if you get it on sale.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
Edit: Fixed restarting constantly problem by removing the USB extension. Too difficult to find movies unless you know the name of the show. Too many apps.

Constantly reboots during the middle of what you are watching not stable at all. Using it on a lg 3D tv. My old non 4k firestick didn't have this issue with this tv.

I have several high end streaming devices and short of built in storage this has every bit as good of a picture quality and streams very good using WiFi, gets great signal with no buffering.

It's time to start actually integrating a functional YouTube app, not just a web browser-based YouTube shortcut that ~kinda sorta works sometimes~. I've been through YouTube's own troubleshooting so many times and they were as helpful as they could be. At this point it's Amazon's problem. They refuse to actually develop a 4k Fire TV Stick app for YouTube -- though the package clearly states, and it is widely advertised as, ""YouTube compatible"". Which, if you were still wondering, is a lie. It seemed fine at first but stopped working. Aside from showing long unskippable ads (on an ad-free premium subscription), Amazon's browser-based YouTube constantly buffers and can only successfully cast from any device about 30% of the time (if you're lucky).",1,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0

I moved it to different HDMI spots, unplugged and plugged the power but it still freezes up after the Fire TV logo with the screen flashing. Part of me is upset but it may be the push for me to find other activities which are more productive. Apart from the device breaking I would give it a 3 out of 5. The user interface needs rework as it cluttered and confusing at times. Seems like everything is thrown on the screen without much thought to it.

The Fire Stick 4K is one of the best options for streaming media you can buy. It is very reasonably priced for all that you get and for all that you can do with it if you take the time to take advantage of its abilities. If you have an Amazon Prime account and if you are familiar with all you can do with this device you know why you should own one for each television in your home.

I have a few gripes, however, not sure if its a FireTV issue or an Netflix App issue. (Netflix sometimes drops audio for a second or two every few minutes).

I haven't used that yet because I have been looking for something that can record my programs. I found out that Fire TV has one for a little under $200. Once I buy that, it's bye bye to cable TV!

I haven't been able to figure out how to watch live TV with the fire stick so I change the TV input back to the TV to watch broadcast shows.  The voice control doesn't work 100% of the time, that is probably something we are doing wrong.  Overall it has been great no problems.

Great product however when  I installed it I couldn't get it to stream video at any higher than 2 or 3 MB. per second while my other firestick was pulling 9 to 10 MB what my service is rated at. I tried everything from moving the router to switching streaming devices to different tvs . None had a problem except for this 4k firestick. As a last desperate attempt before giving up I went into the wifi settings of my router and took it off of auto channel select and picked channel 11 at random.

"Works perfectly for streaming. It’s nice to have everything in one place. Even though I have a smart tv, the fire stick is just superior and much more useful, faster too. Overall it’s a great product. The power cable it comes with is plenty long but I ended up using a short on to just plug into the USB port on my tv. It’s a much cleaner setup and I don’t need to worry about taking up outlet space. My biggest complaint is the size of the remote. I can’t count how many times I’ve lost that thing. The batteries also seem to need to be changed often for a remote. I did spring for the Ethernet adapter but I never use it as my 5G WiFi is plenty fast for streaming. Overall, I’m happy with it.

I have 2016 LG OLED TV and when I use the Netflix app or watch Jack Ryan on the fire stick it goes into HDR 10 mode if I use the Neflix and Amazon app on the TV I get Dolby Vision no problem. I must say I am pretty disappointed because Dolby Vision support was the main factor I picked up the device.

"I have a fire stick 4K in 4 of my TVs around my house, extremely easy to setup. I got these on sale as well, so it was a no brainer for me to finally make the switch from the evil Comcast cable to saving money every month with these. I have fiber internet so I never have any streaming issues anywhere in my house, so I couldn’t say if that would be a problem for others, but I never see buffering. Voice recognition works with ease and seems to be very accurate. If you are looking to make the jump from cable and save money every month, this goes great with your prime membership, Hulu, and Netflix!",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"It’s all crap. It runs Amazon like it says, but overall it’s crap. I actually stopped buying stuff off amazon because it’s all china or over priced items that you can get from the actual store or there website. This item wants you to have an experience opening the box, it failed hard core. Just let me get my item. Next is a USB thumb drive that needs to be PLUGGED IN. My brain exploded with confusion as to WHY. TV’s that are smart come with lots of options one of them is to connect to the internet, so why wouldn’t the stick just use the tv’s connection. OH THATS RIGHT FOR YOU TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON A CORD TO PLUG IN THE STICK, just in case you don’t have any more outlets.  Honestly people if there is a USB thumb drive that has amazon on it I would have just done that, but for the 1 star good it let’s me on as did my tv but I give my tv 5 stars. Voice recognition on remote. Takes a try or two for it to get your voice, might be better when it’s quiet, background was noisy with people.",1,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"I began with my first Fire Stick several years ago at the suggestion of my son-in-law.  At the time of my first purchase, I was using ""Top of the Line"" Roku's, which I had used for over 5 years.  I thought I was totally satisfied with the Roku's.  After FINALLY, (6-12 months later), setting up my first Fire Stick, I was amazed, even though it was the Basic Fire Stick at the time!  I now own 5 additional Fire Sticks, and the old original, I keep in my travel bag.  Roku DID NOT work in Hotels, but the Fire Stick sure Does!  My only complaint about the Fire Sticks, are the Remote.  The Roku was much easier for the Beginner.  However, the Fire Stick's EASE of Install, Alexa feature, Vedio Quality, and, (very important to me), is the Audio!!!  3 of my units include Atmos Audio, and the Audio is Fantastic!!!  I can't say enough GOOD about my experience with my Fire Sticks...Even my old Original unit!  The price, compared to Roku, Apple, and other Streaming Devices, make the Fire Stick a NO BRANER!!!  I highly recommend buying ANY of the current models, depending only on your Monitor(s) and Audio Receiver(s) that you currently use.  I Love My Fire Sticks!!!Jim Jones",5,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
"Transitioned from a PS4 to a firestick 4k for my home entertainment system. It actually blew my mind how good the picture quality became on my 4k UHD tv. Before the firestick, i was considering upgrading my TV to a new OLED model but I think I’m going to hold off for a year and see what’s out next Black Friday! The interface is beautiful, fast and clean. Huge upgrade over the clunky and hard to use PA4 interface. Overall, I’m very pleased with the video/audio quality, ease of use and performance of the firestick. Highly recommend.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
"First, I like be it for allowing me to download just about any app I want. The streaming is great. But, I am disappointed. As a Canadian, I want to watch the Canadian feeds on the NHL app. And yes I can do that, but, the picture although sharp, is dim. It looks like the owners are trying to save money by turning the light intensity down. When I see highlights on cable, the picture looks like I remember it: bright! If you want hockey, look elsewhere -- it's dim on fire stick. I have two firesticks and If there is a solution, I haven't found it.  Nothing works. Not dynamic settings. Not turning the brightness up. It's just dim.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"I have three 'first generation' Fire TV sticks, and LOVE that there is volume control and power buttons on this new version.  The TV with this newer stick responds faster than those with the earlier model on the other three TV's. And the screen resolution is unbelievably better on all four of our TV's through the Fire TV sticks than when we were viewing on our Smart TVs through a satellite TV service we had for years.  I suggest trying one on your TV with a few of your paid apps like Hulu, Netflix, and Prime Video - then maybe you will decide - as we did - to ""cut the cord"".",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0

Me: Overall I am very satisfied with my FireStick.  With that said I think you should consider adding a headphone jack to the remote control that comes with the FireStick.  Having the ability to have walk around headphones would be a big help in situations where one person wants to see and listen to the FireStick programming and the another person wants to do something else in the same room without the TV or Music noise.That enhancement would make FireStick even more valuable/satisfactory ... especially for women on football broadcast days.  Think of it as a Domestic Tranquility enhancement/feature.,5,1,2018-12-2,1,1,0
"The device itself seems to work great- boots quickly, no loading issues. However, one of the major issues with this device is the pairing with an echo device. Commands work fine through the remote, but attempting to command through Alexa on echo is an issue. You can say “Alexa watch (insert show) on firetv” and she will boot up the tv and put on the show. However if you try to get her to power on and off the tv, “Alexa turn on firetv”, she will not be able to and says there is no device with this name. Seems like some major issues between the integration that amazon needs to address. Customer service is pretty useless and doesn’t seem to even know how the products work.",2,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
We ordered two Fire TV Stick 4Ks. Both installed easily although I had to change my Amazon password which I'd had for years! That's a very small criticism really. My family is enjoying the programming daily. Like it so much we're considering adding a TV to our guest bedroom and relying solely on a Fire TV Stick for programming rather than paying for a cable box. We're pretty fully invested in the Amazon ecosystem for purchasing all kinds of products and are equally happy with Amazon services such as the Fire TV Sticks so far. Who knows? There may even be an Echo in our future!,5,1,2019-1-21,1,1,0
Remote works well overall.  I might like it to be a bit larger overall and the buttons to be spaced out just a bit more but that is for future designs.  BACK-LIT would be AWESOME : (  sadly not on this version maybe in the future.  Works well with the FireTV Stick WHEN I can keep the apps working : )  they just seem to die for no apparent reason then need to be reloaded.  I sent one back and have 2 more currently using and having issue again.  So TBD overall.

"We just received our second Firestick after we decided to give it another chance on prime day. We really just wanted a new remote but the remote alone on prime day was $29.99 and the stick and remote was only $25.99???? The remote quality is probably the worst feature as most of the time it only works when it wants to and have to keep pressing the same button to get it to go where you want it to go. We thought with our first it was just a faulty remote but now I'm convinced it's just awful quality in general. It also likes to click over a bunch of selections on it's own when you may have pressed left or right once. Just kind of goes crazy and clicks over wherever it decides. Streaming is awful and freezes often, especially on WMUR App. The options you have for TV shows and movies as a prime member is really limited and 95% of them you have never even heard of considering the amount people pay for prime memberships plus anything additional like Prime music and so forth AND the fee went up since I first became a member. I buy almost everything from amazon and I spend a lot of money. I wouldn't expect that they would sell such awful quality electronics (I also have an Alexa and I won't use it because it doesn't work right).

When trying to use the internet app, if you type in an address, you get a survey request which takes hours to complete for a $1000 Amazon Card. I did not want the card! It requires much information which resulted in my phone receiving 20 robocalls per day. Until I complete the ""survey"" I got only 1-3 robocalls per month. I contacted Amazon complaining about the survey and was transferred to 5 different people to solve the problem. I finally gave up and am now restricting my calls to people in my phone directory.

I also like the fact that the remote now has volume and power buttons, which were missing on the original. I got this one with the $25 off promo and includes a free 1-year subscription of Food Kitchen but I doubt I'll ever use it.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"Had an Apple TV. I don't remember which model, but the one before the apps. Used it for years and worked well. It was time for a new device, with voice, an app availability. I couldn't justify the cost for the new Apple TV. You can use an Apple TV app on this device and play all the stuff you purchased in the Apple ecosystem. I wasn't sure how this could work the same way for the price difference. ORDER IT NOW. It exceeded all expectations. I had an old version of the stick. The extension cord that comes with this model makes it a lot more easy to connect to the TV as well. Great Product.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
I wish I’d known about the Fire TV Stick before I purchased two Roku devices. The Fire TV Stick FAR exceeds Roku. It even picks up my internet signal when it’s weak. Roku could never compete with Fire TV Stick.,5,1,2019-9-29,1,2,0
"Installed Fire Stick on an older TV, video was fine but audio was extremely distorted, I searched settings and did not find the issue so contacted tech support, they were helpful and responsive and tried updating software and changing various settings but could not correct the problem, so they issued a return label and shipped out a replacement Fire Stick.  When I got the replacement  Fire Stick installed, the audio was still distorted like the first one.  This time I searched settings on my own and found that the default audio setting is set for Dolby sound.  I switched it to Stereo and my audio works fine now.  Too bad that tech support did not suggest changing this setting when I had them on the phone with the first one, would have saved a lot of time and hassle.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"We are so pleased with our FireStick 4K - we purchased because we couldn't get Hulu Live on our current TV, even though it was a smart TV we couldn't get the advance Hulu Features. The FireStick is basically plug and play, you don't even need the power adapter if you have extra USB ports on your TV to charge it. The dongle adapter is also very helpful because actual fire stick was too long to fit it the area where the HDMI port is located. but with the adapter that was provided in the box, it is perfect.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,1,0
"I like my 4K fire stick however my two biggest let downs with this device would be 1) amazon fire sticks do not support YouTube tv (you can get it but have to download from a different app) and 2) my fire stick has randomly reset itself at night, making me reset my WiFi/amazon account/ and all apps I previously had, including signing into all of my previous apps. It’s quite annoying typing long emails and passwords over and over when you have a tiny remote and need to click 100 times to type on the screen keyboard.. I've read some forums and have seen other people experience this ‘random’ issue but no advice from amazon on how to avoid this or fix this issue....",3,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
"Our Spectrum bundle (phone, tv, and Internet) was ending and they were going to charge almost $100/month for just tv. We had to make a change. We are already Amazon Prime customers. We found the Amazon Fire TV stick with Alexa and Hulu live TV ($45/month). We are blown away! The picture is every bit as good as Spectrum. I know our tv is supposed to be 2160p capable, but I don't think we've tried 4k content. Hulu live TV is absolutely 1080p. AND ALEXA! My husband has poor vision and always struggled to read the on screen TV Guide to find channels or programming. He just pushes the button (mic icon) and tells Alexa to bring up say CBS on Hulu or The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime. THANK YOU AMAZON!",5,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
"I don't know if the the app  which I downloaded and am using is lacking or if the Fire Stick is to blame, but I find it difficult to train the voice remote ... especially when it is tied to my local stations.  I have to use the guide when I need to move to a specific station, even when I know what station I want. It is certainly a learning curve.  All this is interesting considering the Fire Stick was recommended by my networks.",3,1,2019-11-23,1,1,0
"For whatever reason other than maybe my luck, the firestick is wonderful at managing a bunch of streaming apps but eventually it starts bugging out for me. There becomes delays when you switch and scroll and it gets really laggy sometimes. The suggested solution to this is of course, to unplug it and wait for it to boot up again. But at the point it kind of becomes a weekly chore when you expect for it to stream seamlessly and without lag at all at any time, especially if you're using a 4K device.",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"This review concerns using Unlimited Music via the fire tv device. As an engineer, I recognize this product's  great design and execution. However, I have a gripe with several aspects of the user experience. First, methods for submitting feedback seem to be limited to what I'm doing right now: a customer review. Second, Alexa seems to be Amazon's pride, but there should be an alternative to her booming voice announcing your choice of e.g. a pianissimo orchestral movement. Optionally, put it in a text box, please! Or allow us to opt for just playing it (or not, if not found). Third, for thumb-driven searches, you can't submit a partial word, e.g. ""Brandenb"" for Brandenburg. Really? In my 40+ years of computer use, partial string search is idiomatic. Finally, the thumb-stressing controls should be accessible by voice command as well, but Alexa doesn't parse some key functions, particularly search (see item 3). Will a development team see this? How the hell could I know?",4,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0

The fire stick was very slow and unreliable and Apple TV worked great. When I had a connection problem with the old fire stick one Friday evening, I called customer service for help. The rep fixed my problem and told me how much better the new generation sticks were. I ordered one and WOW was she right!

"After dealing for years with streaming through a blu-ray/DVD player with constant buffering issues, this item is a God-send!  It takes a couple of minutes to download the apps or channels you wish to watch regularly, but once that's done, you are off to the races.  I have used the new Fire TV Stick 4K during peak internet times (we live in a rural area where there is only one Internet service) and there has not been any connectivity issues or buffering problems.

"If you don't often watch YouTube on your TV, this is a fine device and the remote is much better than the older version. The Fire TV Stick 4K device/software forces you to access YouTube through a browser and the picture quality when watching YouTube on the device is significantly worse than the picture quality of the native Youtube app on my LG Smart TV.

Usually I see a sustantial difference in performance and quality etc. This year, however, I am even more amazed than usual. The quality is DEFINITELY noticeable. The new remote is fantastic and I love that I can now control volume and power for my TV as well; something us die hard Fire Stick users have been asking for for a couple years now.

"The fire stick 4k is the best streaming stick out there for the price. But what the hell Amazon??? No HBOMax? No Peacock? All beacuse you think consumers prefer these integrated with the fire platform rather than separate apps??? Ridiculous. Its a stupid power play. Many people,, like myself,, strongly prefer them to be separate. You can, and I did, sideload these apps anyway so what is this dispute really accomplishing? Pissing off consumers and pushing them towards other devices. That's it. Wake up Amazon.",1,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"I'm very pleasantly surprised by the increase in quality. I don't know how they did this but it is really nice. I was not using Prime Video much due to spotty streaming, but this clears it up 100%. Alexa works great for finding entertainment -- much better than my other Alexa in the kitchen for some reason? I have parent controls on and the PIN entry is cumbersome.

"Kept hearing about these fire sticks for years and finally decided to take advantage of the prime-day deals and get one. And I flipping LOVE it. My wife and I have used my 1st-gen ps3 to stream everything for years, and when we started remodeling, we put the 65"" in storage along with the entire surround sound, then used my wife's ancient roku on a small 42"" sitting on a table I put wheels on. That roku was always buffering, always eating up my entire bandwidth for the house, I hated it. It still works don't get me wrong, especially when we were rolling the tv from one end of the basement to the other every few days, but dang... this fire stick was a SIGNIFICANT upgrade. My ps3 worked dang good for the age but wasn't near as user friendly or integrated as the fire stick, plus the fire stick cut my bandwidth usage to a quarter of what the roku was doing at 480p, and I get full HD out here in the boonies now without screaming across the house at the wife to shut her phone's Wi-Fi off. She wasn't happy when the roku conveniently ended up lost in the renovations after she suggested putting it in the guest bedroom.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0

Kelly who called was courteous and gracious. 5 star customer service.  Hope I can get the fire stick not to log me out as often now; however, based on follow up alone I’m 5 stars all the way though.I didn’t need to purchase these devices.  All my TV’s are smart TV’s.  I’ve purchased several though because I liked the interface better and felt it ran smoother.  For the last few months they log me out almost everyday.

Picture quality is amazingly sharp, sound is crisp and clear and I have absolutely no issue with buffering or streaming ability. Mine is setup to my 5.0 ghz Wi-Fi instead of the standard 2.5 ghz, and it works better then any computer I own. I considered buying the Fire Cube, but was advised against it by the people at Best Buy.

I had just a minor set-up hiccup, but once we got it figured out, it was done. I have had it for about 3 weeks, and I am home 24/7 (mostly) so it gets a work-out. I added Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime with no problem.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

"The Fire Stick works well with TV without cable box. If one has cable service, it also allows to access streaming channels (like CBS All-Access, Netflix) channels included with subscription service and extra cable channels. It’s easy to start, just plug-in and update, clear picture, sound, easy to use remote.It also works with a Vizio TV, just be sure to check for updates and connect to the TV through Settings. This allows you to operate volume and Cc with the Firestick Remote in addition to your regularly used remote(s).

The voice recognition works about 70% of the time otherwise you have to repeat what you said multiple times before it either hears you or gets what you said correct. Because it won’t even hardly get my show right I’m too afraid to add anything to my list for fear it will buy a 1,000 of something.

I have to select a much brighter TV mode in order for this to stay bright, and then the colors look too saturated.

I can't buy the remote for less than $25 - crazy rip off. So I might as well buy the firestick with remote for $35 on sale. Really cheap guys! If a remote can't withstand a few drops - useless. My suggestion to all is that you buy the $9 remote cover to protect it. Otherwise, I'm happy with the firestick. Not happy with Amazon. I just spent 30 minutes of my time talking to them.

I wish there was an option to plug it into the hardwire, or for it to be able to function directly through the HDMI port without requiring a power source. We used the Fire TV Stick as our primary source to cut the cord. Once I get my content streaming it's typically okay. However, the software is very laggy and unresponsive at times. Amazon needs to stop bickering with Google and allow the YouTube TV app. Only recently did they allow the official YouTube app. Also, it would be nice if they had a Vudu app, but it seems as if that is too much to ask. Lastly, if they want their customers to buy digital content, they should allow them to purchase movies and tv shows in 4k/UHD instead of reserving 4K/UHD for Prime Video.",3,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0

Navigation on it is simple and takes little time getting used to.What I don't like is the fact that it users all the channels or apps and one must become a member to all those apps which are mostly subscription based in order to use them.,4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
Pretty disappointed with this. I ordered in Mid September. For awhile it worked with no problems and was great! Recently the remote has been messing up. It started messing up by only working for the fire stick and would not control the TV. A couple days later that fixed itself and was working fine.  Now it ONLY works to power on and off my TV but no other function works on the remote. I tried new batteries and no luck. Now I have a worthless piece of junk after not even 6 months since there is no way to work the fire stick without the remote.  Looked into buying a new remote and they are nearly as much as the whole device.  I was also going to purchase a 2nd device for our sons room... not now! I'll be looking into other streaming options to replace this. Very frustrating.*****Update*******,3,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0

"We ordered this recently because Amazon contacted us saying soon our TV would not be able to handle Prime unless we purchased a Firestick.  We were not thrilled but ordered it and a few days later installed it.  The installation was very easy.  We have not used it to it's full complacency yet but we are thinking we are going to enjoy this very much.  We loaded ABC, NBC, and CBS.  Looks like we can stream old shows we might have missed. Cool.  For a one time purchase we feel we will definitely benefit.",4,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"Just got the fire stick today and I'm not very happy. Videos will not play or maybe 2 seconds and then freezes. I specifically bought this to get Disney plus on my TV. I did do what they said by unplugging both the stick and internet box. It worked fine for a couple hours and now it won't play anything again. The home pages pull up and I can look at everything but it will not play the video. If I have to constantly reset my internet box, then this stick is a piece of junk and going in the trash.

"Fire Stick 4K is an intelligent, handy, and seamless operating system to view media on! It was extremely easy to set up and navigate, the only issue I have had was trying to find particular movies that I have viewed before on Prime (Prime is great, if you don't have it, get it!) before. I will ask Alexa to play Avengers on Prime, and she doesn't always find the free one that's available, and I have to do some searching.

"I am very happy with the Fire TV Stick 4K.  I was so happy that I bought two. They replaced 2nd generation Fire TV sticks. I believe that the image quality is superior. I believe the WiFi works better. Sometimes I felt that the 2nd generation stick WiFi was not adequate for the location. I moved the 2nd generation sticks to other televisions.I have not worked with the Alexa interface. I prefer to use the remote. I do like the volume control on the new remote.

"Everything was fine until one day the device started lagging with a ""cross-hairs"" type pattern on the tv. It was not keeping up with all parts of the screen and was very distracting. This especially occurs when there is movement in frame and makes it impossible to watch. The only fix is setting the quality to 1080 down from ""Auto up to 4K"". This would be fine by any time i turn the TV off it defaults back to Auto up to 4k, making me constantly switch back. This is not a wifi, TV (yes, it's a 4k TV), or use issue. It IS the hardware. I thought maybe it was a bad unit, so i ordered a second one, same problem. After doing research, I found that this was a common issue with the new series of 4k Sticks and Amazon has done nothing to help it. VERY disappointed.",1,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0

"I love it. The images are even crisp on my 1080 p. If I have any criticism of it at all it is that there are not enough live T.V. options to get rid of the satellite or a cable. Services like Hulu, Sling, Fubo, are so expensive I am sticking with my satellite DVR. Also, none of those live streaming services allows you to pause and fast forward through commercials on all their available channels. And if you want a package that does you end up paying more than you would for satellite or cable.I will say this though, the picture is perfect and the ability to go from prime, to netflix to those other services seamlessly is fantastic.

"I’ve had it for some time now and I have to say it works great.

Being seniors, it's a learning process but we're really pleased with the Fire TV stick.  I  don't have a 4K TV yet, so can't speak to its ability to stream the higher resolution.  Will by another one for the other TV.",5,1,2019-2-7,1,0,0
"After having a gen2 Firestick and upgrading to the 4k it's a game changer.Even if your tv isn't a 4k it still works great. No more having to keep 2 remotes around. The 4k turns the tv on and off, controls the volume without switching back and forth.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"The nicest thing was riding ourselves of Cable.  There is a cost savings using Fire Stick.  There are a few local channels I do not get, but I am not complaining.  We can access Netflix, You Tube and a great many channels.  If you are indecisive, investigate this as an alternative.  I am very satisfied.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,1,0
we have 4k firesticks for about7 months now . Livingroom is hardwired with an adapter.For the last 3 weeks or so we have been getting a lot of buffering on series programing (LA Law) for instance. gets so bad we stop watching it  and move on to a movie.If the movie is fairly new it plays great . If it is an older movie back to buffering..I wonder if the firestick burns out after a period of time .,4,1,2019-8-28,1,1,0
I bought this after reading quite a few reviews that all said how well it performs.After using it for a day I can already say that I am impressed. Using my 150 mbps wifi connection I have not experienced any buffering or lag at all. Prior to purchasing this Fire Stick 4k I was using an ethernet connection to stream movies from my PC. I honestly can't tell a difference in performance between them and that is amazing IMO. I am also very satisfied with the amount and variety of programming available. The Alexa enabled remote is also fantastic. Overall I am extremely happy with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great alternative to cable TV.,5,1,2019-3-14,1,0,1
"We cut the cord to cable to save some $$ each month. Really enjoying the options with the Fire Stick, but do miss the guide of cable & being able to continue watching a channel while viewing a guide.  Miss the back button that takes one directly to what we were previously watching,  but getting used to these adjustments.  We bought Hulu Live TV to watch sports & other live events & it's a great compliment with the Fire Stick.We do enjoy the many many many numerous options available with the Fire Stick.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to cut the cable cord. Alexa remote is a great feature as well.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,1,0
Constantly loses the WiFi signal. I have other fire sticks (non 4K) throughout our home and we have no problem with those. The 4K stick that is situated no further than 15 feet from my wireless router loses its signal at least once an hour.

"I wish I knew what people were doing to get their devices to work properly. I plugged mine in and at first it worked fine. Then after the first day I had to unplug the device to get my TV to see it ! Then the lag time with getting things to load up is RIDICULOUS. I thought this was the latest and the greatest and I thought we were stepping up, but GIVE ME MY ROKU any day!!! Since I waited too long to return it, I'm probably going to just toss it in the trash. SO disappointed.",1,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0
"The fire stick is a great added component to my tv. Even if you decide not to order YouTube Tv. you can always watch  some free tv shows, I tried YouTube Live Tv for a the trial period, and honestly, the streaming is fantastic, with no glitches, it would also relate to your Router. I purchased the TP-Link AC1750 Mesh Wi-Fi Router, Archer A7, it's the best residential router out there for the money. though it's a great product since I'm a Yankees fan, it does not offer the Yes Network, I'm probably not going to purchase the package. all in all the Fire Stick is worth having..",5,1,2020-9-10,1,1,0

So I just received a new one which I'm looking forward to, I had an older version which had less features but worked well. I hope the new one works as advertised. I like the fact that it controls the on and off and volume of the TV, which limits having to use multiple devices. I also hope to explore some of the other features it has.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0

I have 2 older (non-4k) fire sticks that work great. The 4k one is buggy for me however. Every 3-4th time I go to use it it just gives me a blank screen and I have to unplug it to get it to restart. They other issue is with choppy video; that seems to happen every 10th use and also requires a reset. When it worked it works great; just wish I didn’t have to constantly restart it.,2,1,2018-12-24,1,2,0
"4k stick has a good form factor (unlike previous gen). It performs quickly. The addition of volume control is very welcome. However, I minuses one star for the sharper edges on the new remote (bigger cost saving gaps are present along the edges), and another star for an ineffective browsing interface that wastes time and space.Update: Minusing another star for the horrible graphical interface for viewing your purchased content and wishlist. I've stopped using the device and changed my purchases to other providers.",2,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"I'm annoyed that I had to buy a Fire Stick after I bought a ""smart"" TV a few years ago, and now I don't have enough HDMI inputs to use the FireStick, the PS4 and the soundbar.  I do like the home screen and how it presents all the options you didnt even know you had.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a ton of free content on IMDB app.  I was forced to adapt since PS Vue is shutting down and I will miss their interface.  Maybe I dont know all the shortcuts yet, but I have trouble going back to something recently watched, and I find it very annoying how often it wills top without interaction.  I have not been able to find a setting to change for this.  Also, this is my first time using Alexa and I was kinda mad to ""accidentally"" place an Amazon order for a heater when I was trying to find the heater I had bought recently and buy it again, but it ordered some other one at twice the price.",4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"The perfect streaming device for people who are blind, and the Voice View feature makes it possible for those who are blind set up and get connected all by themselves without sighted assistance.  After unboxing, make sure your tv is turned on and then connect it to your HDMI port of choice, then place the included batteries in the remote and then plug in the power cord.  Wait for the device to boot up and for the welcome music to start.  I’d wait 15 to 20 seconds after the welcome music and then hold down the menu and back buttons together for 3 seconds and Voice View is enabled.  After that, just follow the simple prompts to get you all set up and connected.  If you have people with sight in your household, you can disable Voice View by repeating the process.  Again... hold down the menu and back buttons together for 3 seconds and Voice View is disabled.  You can make changes to the Voice View settings this way.  Press the dotted button between the menu and back buttons.  This is the home button.  Then with the right arrow  button, go all the way to the end to settings and then with the down arrow button, move down to the settings row and then arrow to the right and listen for Accessibility and click on accessibility.  In the accessibility settings, arrow down until you hear Voice View.  Click on that and in there is where you can make changes.  How do I know this?  Because I am blind and set up 2 of these cool devices all by myself with no problems.  I hope this is helpful.",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0

"Fire Stick is unlike many other streaming devices that I have used in past - like Roku etc. The quality of this device is only exceeded by Apple TV. However, IMO the difference in price between Fire and Apple TV makes this Fire Stick a winner hands down. Its hard to find any other streaming device which can offer a product with a voice enabled remote and 4K quality in such reasonable price. I have now been using device for last 2 months and am amazed by the 4K quality and the way Amazon makes best use of Wi-Fi so that there is no buffering in streaming. I also bought the same device for my parents and they have been using it for last 8 months!!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"Our first generation (i.e. version 1) Chromecast had buffering issues, trouble maintaining 1080p resolution due to intermittent WiFi connectivity issues, and became a pain to control through my phone due to very laggy input as well as many dropped connections.The 4k Firestick TV solves every one of those concerns. With the included remote, I no longer have to fumble with my phone if, say, I receive a call during the middle of a stream (a minor but very annoying issue). There is absolutely NO lag from the remote - pressing pause instantaneously pauses or resumes the stream. Load times are virtually non-existent (no videos or shows require buffer times, be they through Prime Video, Netflix, or YouTube). Picture quality is excellent with only very occasional dips from peak quality and only very briefly. The remote is also able to power on/off the television and control its volume, so only a single remote is necessary for viewing. We don't have any other peripheral audio devices, so I can't speak to that.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
I'm currently using an LED TV that's approximately 6 years old. The smart functionality is so slow that it's not even worth using. I decided to give this fire stick a try. Plugged it into my HDMI port and it has transformed my old TV into a beautiful picture. Everything is lightning fast the picture is better than it's ever been.  I was considering buying a new TV and I'm definitely not going to now. This has saved me so much money! Highly recommended.

"I love these.  I switched from Directv to Hulu and the fire tv stick 4k is the perfect platform to combine everything I now watch - Hulu live tv, Netflix, Prime video, and the NHL app from.  When Amazon added the volume control buttons on the latest stick, it meant I now have 1 remote that controls everything - my Samsung TV, sound (tv, sound bar or receiver) and on/off.  Nice because now my wife doesn't complain about having 3 remotes to run things.Pairing with my alexa (echo) is kind'of wonky as their instructions aren't right, but voice input right on the remote is generally what I use when I want that.",5,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0

"Been a fan and a user of the fire stick for years. Last few weeks all our sticks have gone crazy apparently and are not working. They connect for five seconds and disconnect and stay on an unavailable home screen forever... or work and exit me out of apps out of nowhere. We had 3. I reset one of them to factory default and then we couldn’t even log in to our acct. It would freeze up at that screen or tell us that it did not recognize our account. So after that we purchased a new one thinking maybe it was old software, same situation. It works in the living room. Starts giving trouble and we juggle it around, and it doesn’t work anywhere else. We have strong internet connection and two bandwidths. I can run a full streaming on my iPad in the same room where the sticks don’t work.  There is something going on with this devices. Contacted customer service regarding this and someone responded and their advise was that I change my password so I could log in, and when I said I was not going to do that because that is not the issue, they disconnected and left me hanging. So disappointed. I had never experienced a bad situation with Amazon, but the situation with this stick is seriously frustrating. Hope if you purchase you have much better luck.",1,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0

"This is my 3rd Fire TV product.  All of them work great and this is the best so far (4K Fire TV Stick).  I really like the new remote that allows you to control the power and volume of the TV.  I no longer have to switch between remotes just to turn up/down the volume of a movie or streaming TV show.  The one think I wish Amazon (Hint, HINT) would offer is a more universal remote that could control more TV functions like channel selection via numeric keypad and switching of TV input sources so I could move from Antenna to Fire TV HDMI port.  This would make the Fire TV stick (systems) perfectly setup for ""cutting the cable TV"".

My only othe option is to return it and get a non 4K version.Update.  I’m changing my review to 5 stars. After posting the review, Amazon reached to me.  Turned to be just a minor issue.

The firestick is nice when it works but we have 3 and they all disconnect far too often. We have “good” to “very good” signal strength so it’s tough to troubleshoot and our phones and tablets have no trouble staying connected.

Beautiful picture from the LG Oled TV and great sound from the surround sound.  I can use the smart TV apps, but we are used to the Firetv interface so we were going to go with the stick. Then day 2, the screen flashes black every few minutes and then loses signal completely.  Tried unplugging, resetting, bought new 4K HDMI cables tried different HDMI ports in the TV and amp. Nothing fixes the black screen flashing and signal drop.  Checked the internet speed and it was good.  I’m going to return this to Best Buy and just use the LG apps, I’ve wasted a day of my life on this and I’m giving up.

Have not tried traveling or switching it to another TV since the power outlet makes it a big of a hassle but Netflix has never buffed and I use it every day.

If I'm idle, the device automatically starts playing ""Amazon ads"" trying to get me to buy more stuff (movies, devices, etc.).  And there's WAY too much clutter in the UI.  I don't watch that many movies and I never buy movies, so please stop showing me these ads.  Maybe scan the antenna (And other TV sources) and suggest things I might be interested in that are free.

The major drawback for me is it's inability to be controlled by my Harmony universal remote.  The claim is that is communicates with bluetooth and my remote only supports IR devices.But I did notice that the FireTV itself could slightly control other IR devices.  Which implies that it has an IR interface.  But not enough that I could use IT for the universal remote.  Pretty much a catch 22 no matter what I tried.  My goal is to reduce the remote controls down to one ideally.",3,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0

Couldn’t believe how I made something so easy so hard! Ha!Ha! Did have to use an extension strip. It’s great because you turn tv on with fire stick remote and your choices are right there.

"I recently sign up for Amazon Music HD and was hoping that I could use the Fire TV 4K to bitstream 24/96 audio to my AV receiver.According to Amazon's official specs it can do ""PCM/Wave. Up to 96kHz, 6 channels, 16-bit and 24-bit."" and ""Dolby Atmos (EC3_JOC). Up to 48kHz, 8 channels, 16-bit and 24-bit"" but there's no option in settings or in the Music app to make this happen.

"First off I love my Apple TV and recommend it to anyone for ease of use and enjoyment. BUT after buying 3 (over $450) I hate the price point. So this Black Friday I picked up a Firestick for $20 and immediately enjoy it. While not the same by any means. The interface is clean, modern and the options for apps are just right. Also it’s pretty quick and the integration with Alexa has made it fit perfectly in my “ecosystem” lol. So only a couple days in but I’m very pleased.",4,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

I no longer have cable service and couldn't be happier except it is a bit inconvenient when I want to watch a live sports program. The subscriptions are very expensive, so I can only watch Thursday night football. I would so love to get NBA, NFL, and NASCAR without having to sell my children to get them. I can understand a subscription price but one that is reasonable as most of the other subscriptions. Maybe next year?",5,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
"I bought this firestick to use with the apps that are not compatible with apple tv. That is why I could test if it could measure up. Unfortunately it has a lot of problems. First thing you notice is that the resolution is VERY DARK, if you compare with other screens you'll notice the video is a lot darker. The worst part is that it keeps disconnecting from internet all the time. I check the network connection on apple tv and smart tv they show very good signal, but on firestick it shows either fair or moderate  It has a hard time maintaining wifi connectivity and when you’re on a network it keeps on buffering continuously every few minutes and sometimes disconnects it. I know this because I have a smart tv and the connection is perfect, also a apple tv next to it and it plays all the networks perfectly, then I use sound system with perfect connection. it’s only the firestick that does not work correctly. The other flaw is the silk browser and firefox which display numerous adds while surfing and if you install any ad guard on the device most sites ask to disable it. Then there is the problem that has happened twice in the month I’ve had it, the voice and video lose their sync and the only way was to restart the device completely for it to work correctly. The only pros I have seen is the ease of installing apps but when they buffer it defeats the purpose. I wish Amazon had perfected the device before marketing it to customers.",1,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
"I have used my original fire stick for years and thought I liked it. This new 4k fire stick is 100% more awesome!

So much faster loading and starting streams, it is a completely better operating device. Faster mirroring with my fire tablets.

They couldn't figure it out and opted to send me a new one.  The new stick showed up two days later.  Same issue, but this time I painstakingly went through the stick settings.  Once I selected 'Adaptive; under the Dynamic Range Settings, I was good to go, ergo the second pic.  And yes this is a 4K Tv.",4,1,2019-7-19,1,0,1
"I like the picture on my 4k Phillips TV.  Which for some Reason came with Netflix App But Not Amazon Prime Video App.  So I ended up Buying the 4K Fire Stick.  It Does everything you'd need it to do, BUT, It basically Hijacks the TV and make my Smart Apps Through the TV UN-Usable unless you unplug the Fire-stick USB.  Which is totally Fine because it has everything the TV didn't have as far as apps go.  BUT, If i just want to turn the News on in the morning after watching Prime/Netflix on the Fire Stick the night before i have to use they fire stick remote to pick LIVE TV TUNER and then use my TV remote to watch The Local news which I do everything morning.  Seems kind of off that the remote cant change the channel on simple live air TV.  Its not a huge deal just a small inconvenience.  Other that that no complaints.

"UPDATE: You can sideload HBOMax (and Peacock too) if you follow guides online. Not exactly simple, but not too complicated. FireTV is essentially just a skin on Android, so most Android apps work if you sideload. Google Drive is still not supported, but at least HBO and NBC work.I had been using a 1st gen fire tv stick and it had gotten so slow that it was almost unusable. Streams dropped constantly and navigation was horribly slow. They clearly updated software too far for the old hardware to support.

I noticed many more details and colors than with Vudu 4k.  So far the other apps I've used also look/sound great.  I can watch live TV using my Xfinity account for the four network channels as well as cartoon network, discovery, and history channels.

When you choose that movie or TV show, then you find out about their ""Free"" downloads.  Of course, after installing the service is the only time you see what the monthly fee would be.  That needs to be upfront.",4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
Voice commands stopped working after one week. I was told to reset the fire stick but resetting any device after one week is not a good sign of things to come. It also does not work well with Sling which is mainly what I watch. I have Sling DVR and of you pause a show and go out of that show it doesn’t keep your spot. When you go back to that show it starts it from the beginning and you have to find where you left off. It’s a fraction of the price compared to other 4k streaming devices so if your just wanting it for the 4k and don’t care about functionality then you’ll like it.,2,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"Had the original fire stick since it came out. Just updated to this one because the old one had trouble loading/buffering and with the price on Prime Day I just decided to upgrade!

I’m not exaggerating, I would have to alternate between two buttons and eventually it would turn on. I would get frustrated since it’s also a newer TV.

"3trd Update 7/23/2020:  If you do decide to buy a fire stick make sure to buy the extended warranty so you don't totally waste your money!!! The rep tells me this is a known issue with the fire tv stick 4k and they are working on it.  They have been working on it for months, so basically they are selling defective devises and hoping people just give up when they quit.  I believe Amazon should be standing behind the products they sell when there are these types of issues, but it seems that is not the case - you are just out of luck if you happen to be one that this is an issue with.  I realize it is not a lot of money, but at this stage it is the point that it is happening to multiple devises.  Maybe they should stop selling them until they get the problem fixed or offer a longer warranty since it is the update that is forced on you that causes them to quit working2nd Update: Back to a brick - another fire stick bites the dust.  I have 3 sticks sitting here that are all doing the same thing - black screen white logo - never boots.  I called amazon because 2 of them are just out of warranty date barely a year old.  1 is only 5 months old.  They are supposed to be sending a refurbished replacement stick and for some reason they can't manage to get it sent.  2 days late now and says to wait 1-2 days more - wated and it still did not arrive.  Had to waste my time and call Amazon again, just to be told they will send another replacement.  I received an email that they updated to 2-day free shipping at no additional cost to me - seriously!!!",1,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
We have been using the same projector television for 14 years and using our bluray to access amazon prime. After installing the Firestick everything is so much easier to access. Using the remote it turns on both TV and bluetooth speaker. The picture and sound is so much better. One thing that irritates us the most is when watching series of episodes from DVD player amazon app doesn't play the next episode automatically however the Firestick plays the next episode automatically makes watching experience so much easier.  The only regret is I wish I had bought this long ago.  Thanks amazon for making such great products!,5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0

My son loves it as he can play his video games and control the whole thing with just his voice. I can sometime hear him having a lengthy conversation with Alexa.

"This is 10x's better and much faster than my older Fire TV Sticks. I love having the volume control, mute button, and given its got an infrared output it works to control my Sonos Playbase.

"To be fair, this is my 2nd 4K Fire Stick, and I would rate this 5 stars if you use this in regular configuration, connecting Video and Audio through HDMI and then SPDIF digital audio to your receiver or soundbar.  I have one in this configuration and it works flawlessly, 5 stars.  I also use it with Miracast to show pictures and videos from tablet as well.However, since it is now COVID era, we need outdoor entertainment.  Got this 2nd Fire Stick to hookup to my new projector through HDMI, but then connect Fire Stick to outdoor blue tooth speakers through blue tooth.  Connection works great, except there is not way to control volume, it is always at maximum.  This is an oversight from Amazon, we should be able to use blue tooth to control volume.  I can use my phone and tablet to control volume of those same speakers with either Spotify or Groove music app.  Same issue if you want audio to go to your blue tooth headphone late at night to not bother others.  I hope this will only take a firmware update to enable this feature, at which point I will change rating from 1 star to 5 stars.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
I can’t remember why I bought this when I had Apple TV.  If you want Dolby ATMOS and or Dolby vision this is not the product you want. Apple does a superior job.  For example I selected a movie on Apple it lists the movie in Dolby ATOMOS and Dolby vision then I select the Fire Stick and the same movie and it lists it as HDR 5.1.  Like I said I don’t remember why I bought this I never use it.Update after reading more on getting the stick in ATMOS I finally got it.  It’s seems for one Prime has two versions of a movie standard and 4K after selecting the 4K version then going to the audio options I found the ATMOS button and the ATOMS lit up on my receiver.  I was use to my Sony BR and Apple TV selecting automatically.  Little more trouble but it works fine.,4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"First - you have to have a reasonably fast and very reliable internet connection. We do and I love the Firestick. We do not use Alexa so I can't rate that, don't want her listening in all the time. The streaming quality is good as long as your internet connection is good and if it isn't you can't blame the Firestick.We cut our cable TV but kept Netflix and added Amazon Prime plus CBS all access so we can get local news and I don't miss those 79 channels I never watched.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"We upgraded from an older version firestick. The old one was annoyingly slow to respond, and would take 2-4 minutes to connect to an app/stream. This one is so fast! It connects almost instantaneously. You also don’t have to mash the buttons for it to respond like the old remote. This remote is much higher quality. It’s easy to use and navigate. I’m very impressed overall. Not sure yet how I feel about the Alexa feature, I’m not a huge fan of digital voice assistants, but I’ve tried it a few times and it works well. Regardless, it’s totally worth the money (not to mention we got a discount for upgrading)! Even if I had paid full price, it would have been well worth it.

My new 4K streaming TV has most of the same access to all I can receive with the Firestick. The Firestick added more free apps to our service.The reason I purchased the Firestick is that the TV system would skip video segments by freezing but the audio would still play.

I like most things about the fire stick but couldn't make the 4k stick work on my Vizio 4k TV after the first couple of days. It would suddenly wash the screen in purple.

I contacted customer support and wound up getting a replacement 4k fire stick but the same thing happened. It works fine on a different TV but not the 4K.

So, I kind of let the Firestick set while using the smart aspect of the tv which was ""fine"".  I eventually decided to sign up for Disney + and soon found that the customization of the tv is non existent.  If it's not one of the apps that is included then I am just SOL.  Don't get me wrong, I love my tv, but at the same time, the Firestick is soooo much more intuitive.  I have become and will be a loyal Amazon customer.

"I had issues with this device within a few months of purchase right after I upgraded my tv to the newest model (high end Samsung Smart TV). When I called customer service, they spent time walking me through but making me think that the issues were how the fire stick and smart tv were not communicating. Since my Smart TV had all the same apps, I decided to take out my firestick and just use my smart tv.Months later, I decided to use this firestick on a different tv in a different room and the firestick is restarting over and over. After my call with customer service, they now admit that it is a faulty device. But because it is now out of warranty, they will charge me for a replacement. From my experience with this firestick and other devices, I would say that you would be better off using Roku or better yet, getting a Smart TV and just ignoring this device altogether.",1,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
I never figured I'd purchase a fire stick since I have a $1500 samsung smart TV. Well after doing some research on the 4k model and a half off price to coax me I decided to try it out. It has been a pretty awesome device. Theres no lag or really any buffering when streaming. The internal storage is small but a flash drive and a otg cable fixes that. Also I find the interface is a bit jumbled up and takes a little bit to get used to. But other than that it's a nice add on device for any tv.,5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"After finding out that I needed a streaming device to be able to watch my sports I begin to look at streaming devices. After looking at several, I went ahead and bought the Fire Stick and because of being a Prime member, I got the 4K device with the Alexa Voice Remote. The streaming quality is top notch, I have not had any trouble with buffering at all. You can buy a wifi extender if your wireless internet has problems with signal strength but I did not need. Being able to search and find the program I am wanting using the Alexa Voice remote is very convenient and easy to do.

Device looks pretty sleak although I miss the orange and black tones the old Fire stick had (like during the app install screens when sideloading). Device is based off Nougat and not Lollipop, so that's a plus. My only major complaint is the lack of upgrades to the web browser. Amazon, how can you upgrade Android and FireOS and still leave us on Chromium Webview 59 like on the last Fire Stick? New device should warrant a new web browsing engine. Sites are more likely to break and not render properly. Please address this in an update.As for the positives, Alexa is spot on. The curated apps work well with the device, albeit with their limited selection. Alright for watching TV streams off the internet, but that old Webview version I believe is causing issues.

It's ok. but the remote stopped working after a month. Called Amazon about a repair and they told me they'd ship a new one and I would have to return the old one for diagnosing.

I called and they told me that the first rep told me the wrong thing and that we would have to ship the old one to them and then they would send it back fixed. It's been over a month that we couldn't use the Fire TV because of no remote.

I went with the FireTV Stick 4k at first as I used to enjoy the original FireTV Stick and it has a lot of features.

As soon as you go to the home screen, there are ads for Amazon Prime Shows, each tab is dedicated to Amazon's services, and it's very difficult to find your apps. This ended up being a dealbreaker for me as I don't use Amazon Prime Video and the constant advertisements made it difficult for me to want to keep using the device. On the other hand, the Roku's interface is much easier for me to navigate and while there are ads on the homescreen, they're off to the side so you won't unintentionally click on them.

"Bought the original Amazon Fire TV about 6 years ago and I was always happy with it. Use it mostly just for Amazon Prime movies and Netflix. Around the same, I also bought an Apple TV to use for my Apple Music subscription. (Since then, I have gotten a sound bar and found that my iPad works fine with just the sound bar - no Apple TV needed).Recently I dropped cable and started YouTube TV and had to use the Apple TV as old Fire TV wouldn't work with YouTube TV app. I have always liked the Fire TV remote much better  than the Apple TV and so bought the new Fire TV stick.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

"I have 3 4k Samsung smart TVs in my house so I was very apprehensive about purchasing one of these because why would I need one? Besides the organized, easy to use interface the answer was simple...these will always stay current with the latest updates and apps. TVs such as Samsung stop being supported after a few years, for example my father was unable to add Disney+ to his Samsung TV because it was a pre-2016 model. That alone made the purchase well worth it and I never experience any lag/buffering time. The integrated Alexa functionality is just a bonus.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
My sonny bravia did not support Netflix anymore so I decided to get the fire tv stick to access it. Neither did I know that the Fire TV Stick was amazing.

"I bought this because Vizio quit streaming Amazon video and YouTube. Plus it seemed to lag a lot but it is 5 years old. I hooked this up to it and now I get a lot more apps to stream from and it was less costly than buying a $250 tv. Also, you can simply connect it to another tv (garage or mounted tv) and it's small so it's hidden on a mounted tv except you will have the power cord to run through the wall to the outlet if you are like me and don't like to see cords. I haven't tried connecting it to my Alexa yet.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
I really like my fire stick I bought one for my sister as well because she didn't have a DVD player but she had Netflix and all that other good stuff it's very small for how much power is baked into it I would totally recommend doesn't use a lot of power it has a built in Wi-Fi adapter so no need to plug anything else into it I like the remote it's very simple Alexa does pretty much everything I need it to my favorite app to use is PlayStation Vue but there are a lot of other good TV streaming apps available like Hulu YouTube there are also a few simplified Games available for it not the greatest selection but some decent time wasting games even if you have a smart TV it's a great companion because most TVs don't have all of the available apps that you can use on a fire stick unless you go with something that has fire TV built-in or a Roku device built in from personal experience that fire stick is much better than any of the Roku devices I've owned over the years,5,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0

It hasn't buffered or mysteriously lost network connection, or just plain 'ole rebooted itself, once. I hadn't been able to use my old one for months, I just got fed up. This 4K stick is so much faster, and the added touch of Alexa makes me want to use it more. I'm a little annoyed that the transfer wasn't as smooth as I would have liked, I assumed apps and settings that I had would transition over, but they didn't. Not that much of a big deal, but now i have to go find the videos that my grandkids always watched because they are no longer showing in recents.

Just plug the stick or adapter for the stick into the HDMI slot in the TV, enter your WiFi information and log into the apps. You will need a bluetooth keyboard for typing in your log in information, but they sync up quick. I would highly recommend these sticks to anyone. And you can talk into the remote!!!!",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
Super easy to set up. Wish Amazon would do something about their clunky home screen though. Not very user friendly.

"I was very excited to be able to drop the highly expensive cable company. The Firestick arrived, I hooked it up and downloaded my apps, which was Netflix, Sling and SwoopTV. I have Duel 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Internet @ approx. 110M download/5M Upload with no obstructions between the TV/Firestick and Modem location; distance approx. 25ft. The firestick was easy to install and I was checking out channels within 5 min. BOOM...Buffering..so I started to look at network congestion and wireless interference and decided to purchase the Amazon Ethernet Adapter. While waiting for the Adapter to arrived I went ahead and relocated the Modem To my closet which is located directly behind my wall mounted TV. Installed a Ethernet cable thru the wall and fished the firestick power cord thru as well so as Not to see any wires at the TV location. The Adapter showed up 3 days earlier then I expected (Nice!) Hooked it up and 80% of the buffering was corrected...Now keep in mind that the buffering IS NOT A FIRESTICK ISSUE... I have been on the Firestick now for about 3 weeks and to me this is the device that allowed me to reduce my cable bill by 70 bucks a month, as a side note I dropped Sling as well. I currently Pay the $19.99 SwoopTV (912 Channels) and 100M Internet for $70.00. The 4K Firestick is very responsive and the Alexa voice is a very nice feature. Thank you.",3,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0

"We decided to go with Amazon Firestick when we cut the cord to Spectrum because my son already had this set-up and we saw it in operation. Installed simply by plugging it into an HDMI port but it requires its own power source, a USB charger, which comes with it in the package. Price at $39.99 is reasonable. We have it on four TVs and are very happy with it. Any improvements we could ask for is not for the Firestick but the service we chose. Be careful about that!If you choose to go this route, be sure to have wide band internet service. Alexa is a nice extra for those who don't feel silly talking to a clicker. It works very well.",5,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0
"Fire TV Stick 4K will use your internet data even when powered off.  We bought two Fire Sticks 9 months ago and recently had to switch to a different internet provider that has data limits on their plans.  We went over our data limit immediately because of the Fire Sticks.  If your Fire Stick is connected to the internet it will constantly use data unless you physically disconnect the Fire Stick from its power source (it happens when plugged into an AC adapter or USB connection to your TV.  Our new internet service provider has an app where we can track the data use by device including the amount of data and time of day.  Unlike any other device the Fire Stick draws internet every single minute of the day unless you disconnect it from power.Amazon customer service was terrible and said: 1) there must be another non-Amazon device using all that data and 2) I shouldn't be using a cell phone internet plan for devices (which I'm not, I said several times that my ISP was Xfinity).",1,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

Great device but one problem. It makes LG TVs freak out when you use voice search. It resets the HDMI connection. You then have to change the input. It also made two of my units go into service mode and the LG TVs turned off and on until we unplugged it It stopped after 24 hours past. It’s not just this upgraded one it all amazon fire sticks.

I was going back and forth deciding how to get off cable and I read review of this device and others.  I am a non-technical person.  Right away it was really easy to configure for all of my TVs - I bought 3.  I have not utilized the Alexa integration yet as I'm not sure I really need it and I only used the voice recognition once - when I couldn't find something right away in the app.  We have way too many TVs but I'm considering buying a couple more.

And why cant i set how long before it sleeps?",1,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"This is my 2nd 4K stick.  Works as great as the first one.  I don't have any complaints.  I use this one with an HDMI to RCA converter so that my parents can enjoy watching on their old CRT in the bedroom (which they don't want to get rid of).A suggestion: The scaling option could use additional options like left, right, up, and down movement of the screen.  Right now it offers only basic expand and contract screen area options.  Please add this.",4,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0

I'm struggling with CBS All Access most of the time.  Just found my local CBS station live; didn't think that was available.  Slowly but surely, I'll get the hang of it.

"The overall performance of the device is fantastic.  Quick response and the speech recognition is not bad.However, the user interface is cluttered and distracting.  Apps that have not been installed and advertisements take up 90% of the screen.  If would be a 5 star review if you were able to turn all of the non-essential crap off.  Perhaps it is possible to root the device and put a better skin on it.  That would truly make this a great device.",3,1,2019-9-13,1,1,0
I gave this 4 stars because it takes a good amount of time to boot up. Not sure if it is because of the device it is attached it. I have it connected to my project and when I press the power button it also powers on my projector which is a plus. Problem is it doesn't power down my projector unless I have not figured out how yet. It is almost a one remote system. The quality of the streaming is perfect. Running things over wifi and I have not noticed any stuttering or lag.,4,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

"We had problems with getting our prime videos with a message that we had ""bandwidth"" problems.  I got our provider techs here, a prime video person and Samsung rep on the phone and we all worked together for 5 hours to find the problem.  It ended up that it seems the base problem was with the Samsung Smart TV.  I called the closest Samsung repairman and he wanted $125 just for coming out before he could ""fix"" the TV.  Our provider techs recommended the Firestick and for $49.99 we ordered it.  When it got here, I worked on getting it hooked up and set up.  It's been great and we are enjoying more movie choices including no problems with prime video (never Netflix).  Highly recommended.",5,1,2019-4-3,1,0,0
"My son and family visited over Christmas. Being able to watch the local football game was important for their visit. My son was able to log in to his own TV subscription provider through the Fire TV Stick 4K and much to all of our surprise, the viewing quality was superior to his TV at home. We have an HD Smart TV and the Fire Stick worked its magic to make the screen appear to be 4k. Success! Very pleased with the streaming ability and ease of use as well.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"So we bought several fire sticks last year on prime day, and came back for more this year! We have them on almost all of our TVs and have given several away too! They’re perfect. We added it onto our Roku tv because the remote was so weird and the interface is hard to use, thanks to Alexa and the fire stick, we no longer have that issue! Not to mention the awesome feature of just telling her what you want to watch and she pulls it right up! Super convenient and totally worth the money.",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0

It would be a huge addition tona dumb tv.I saw some entries from Troy @ troypoint.  I didn’t realize you could add so many apps.  I ordered a regular tv and move this to my 4k tv.  Compared to the mxq box this is light years ahead.  Just in configuration.  Apk’s will auto install, removing them after install is so much easier, the os asks if you want to remove it.  My MXQ box will be in the circular file!",5,1,2019-1-30,1,0,0
"Two weeks ago I bought Apple TV. (I'm an Apple girl). It was a BIG headache to set up and not easy to use. The remote , for me, was very difficult. Sometimes it worked and sometimes not. It was (approx) $250 with the cable. Took it back today and got a Firestick. WHAT A BIG DIFFERENCE! Easy to set up and easy to use. I have Direct TV that I , most likely, will not soon give up. I like being about to record and watch shows later. However I wish I had ordered the Firestick soon. I highly recommend! I'm a Senior and had NO trouble installing and using.

I had started my streaming experiment with Roku since my daughter had given us a Roku device in 2011.  I added about 4 Roku streaming sticks or other Roku streaming device so that I could stream on multiple devices.  I had nothing but trouble with each and every Roku device until my streaming company suggested an Amazon Fire Stick.  I have had nothing but great results ever since.  This Fire Stick even allows me to stream in my detached garage.  Thanks Amazon.,5,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
"The reviewers who say that this product is ""fast and responsive"" likely have only used Fire TV products. Compared to other options - even casting from your phone - is a better experience.The UI is clunky at best. Too much of the screen real estate is focused on Amazon content. Designed by engineers for Amazon engineers.",2,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
In general I love the fire stick but I cannot use the music apps because I cannot force the screen saver to launch.  I have an OLED TV which cannot tolerate static portions of the screen without developing burn in issues.  (That the TV will not let me force a launch of the screen saver is a separate issue.)  I would think a product that forces a 4K setup of the TV would allow one to launch a screen saver when listening to music.Thus access to all that music in Amazon's library is not viable.,4,1,2019-5-19,1,1,0
"I like the Firestick, but I’m having trouble knowing which apps are free and which are not.

Also when I go to home,  many of the apps are repeated and if I don’t use the one I had used before, I get asked to select my cable company. I don’t have a cable company anymore!

I have bought 4 of these things and I don't know why I bother. The remotes for the first two stopped working after a month so you had to download and use the app- eventually that stopped working too. So we upgrade to the newer ones and one is super slow to load anything and the newest one just stopped turning on after 4 days. I've tried unplugging it and everything else- the TV just doesn't recognize it. Beyond frustrating but I have finally learned my lesson to use any other type of streaming stick.,1,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"The good news is that it's easy to set up and get going. The voice activated remote is very cool and works well. I was disappointed to find that many of the ""channels"" are by subscription. They'll tell you to download the app(s) for free, which is true, but when you go to watch something more often than not it's, ""Free with your 7 day free trial"", then, you have to subscribe to the channel. I haven't had a chance to explore the offerings too much, so I can't really say how common it is.",3,1,2019-1-3,1,1,0

The Fire Stick is considerably more user friendly.  I highly recommend the Fire Stick.  The only problem I’ve ever had with the Fire Stick is a remote died on one of my Fire Sticks....no problem....I can use the app on my iPad or iPhone to control it so it’s not a huge issue.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

Looking at the system menu said it had enough memory.  A chat with Amazon support suggest factory reset.  Great, now I have to reinstall all the other apps.  Did that, worked for a few months and now it is saying it's out of memory again.  They should have either installed sufficient memory or gave us an SD card slot like the original Fire TV box.

Roku media player by default out put Dolby digital sound but half of my collection are invisible for some strange reason, and it takes forever to load movie library.",5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
I bought this to replace the original Firestick. I would like to say that the first one (not the 4K version) would lose signal and was constantly buffering or whatever it was doing while we watched the spinning wheel. This version is better as far as the signal goes. It must have a better antennae and that was the main reason we bought this.

"Overall I like this device despite the overly aggressive pushing of Amazon content in the interface.  The Wi-Fi reception on this is terrible and kept dropping signal despite both my built-in TV apps and my Blu-ray player apps having no problems streaming in the exact same location.  I could have gone with the Roku stick which reviews with excellent Wi-Fi reception, but I wanted the Alexa remote capabilities to continue building upon my existing Echo ecosystem.  Adding the visual component to Alexa skills is a wonderful upgrade over my existing Echo Dots and enhances the overall experience greatly.  It will also be great to have as I continue to expand my Echo ecosystem going forward.  I ended up having to upgrade my existing Wi-Fi router as well as adding a range extender to fix my Wi-Fi reception issues which will help the performance of my ecosystem as it grows in the future as well.",4,1,2019-2-1,1,0,0

I took the new stick off of my tv and put the old stick back on. Badda-Bing-badda-Boom, I was returned to a happy place as the old stick works just fine and does the things I wanted.

For instance, when I want Netflix or YouTube to open, sometimes I'll tell it to open the app and it'll say ""that is not supported"" or ""I found Netflix and Netflix app original, which one do you want?""  What does that even mean?  So then I'll say Open YouTube or Netflix on Fire TV and it'll work.  Other days if I say the same thing ""Open Netflix on Fire TV"" it says that is not supported and I have to command to open it without the ""Fire TV"" part added to the command.

I’ve had multiple Fire sticks on multiple TVs and every single one has an issue staying connected. Apparently I’m not the only one with this problem after doing some research.

Upgraded from a first generation fire stick. It was still working fine but the remote wandered off. So I took advantage of the prime day sale and got this wonderful upgrade. Setup was super fast and easy. My tv is a few years old so I wasn't confident the remote would sync and work. It instantly synced! The Alexa voice option also works well. I'm sure after some experimenting I will get the hang of it. The picture is perfect and I have had no playback issues. I am happy with my purchase.,5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

This is the 2nd 4k Firestick that I have had. The first one the sound would just stop working while watching different apps. I would have to unplug it and plug it back in and then reload everything. It would stop at random times. I got a replacement sent to me and the replacement does the same thing! I have troubleshooted it and nothing seems to work.

"The Fire TV Stick 4K is a major improvement over its predecessor in our opinion if for no other reasons than we were able to ditch the TV receiver’s remote control devices. We can now control the most common functions of the TV (power and volume) with the Fire Stick’s remote control. We have no use for Alexa so can’t comment on that. We stream mostly foreign TV and as with the pre-4K Fire Stick model, picture and sound quality is superb, a major improvement over domestic over-the-air broadcasts or satellite TV.

I did get a bad one and had to go back to best buy and replace it.  No issues.  The new was hooked up in 5 minutes and downloading in 10 minutes.

"After finally cutting cable, we've been using a Roku TV as our main TV for about a year while our bedroom TV sat mostly dormant. We decided to put it to use, so we dug out an old first-generation Fire Stick from a drawer. It was mostly as I remembered - slow, flat out unresponsive at times, and a buffering/stuttering stream. I can live with it, I thought, as I mostly only used that TV for news in the morning as I was getting ready.But when my six-year-old took over the main TV, I figured it was time to put the bedroom TV into service more, so I bought the latest Fire Stick. And WOW, what a difference! It's lightning-fast, and the built-in wi-fi extended means I don't have any more buffering.

"Much faster than my first Fire TV Stick and the sound and video are exceptional but it would not identify my Samsung TV so volume controls and the mute button won't work.As a test, I asked to play some Vivaldi and now, no matter what I request or do, it always goes back to Vivaldi.",2,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"While I am struggling to figure out the Alexa integration, everything else about these have exceeded or at least MET my expectations. I used to be totally loyal to Rokus because those were my first dedicated streaming products, but Amazon Fire TV has basically made  Rokus obsolete in my life, outside of ONE APP, Xfinity Stream. Once Amazon Fire TVs add support for Comcast Xfinity Stream, I will be able to sell or give any my Roku devices, which I was unable to live without for at least a couple of years.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"This is much more responsive and a whole lot less laggy than the 1080 version of the firestick. It has more memory and storage capacity which is fantastic, and the ability to power on/off your TV along with having the volume up/down feature is priceless. The best part is there's no configuration for the remote. Just go into the settings and it detects your TV through the HDMI connection and automatically configures the remote for you! I loved it so much I purchased a 2nd one to replace my 1080 version, and I'm going to give my 1080 version away.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"The fire stick installed well and works as promised.  One of the reasons I bought it though was because HBO Now is dropping support of my Samsung TV at the end of July.When I installed the fire stick I got a message that HBO will not be supported on my fire stick after the end of July.  First of all I don't understand why HBO is doing this to it's customers.  First they dropped coverage on Dish, so I went to HBO Now, but it looks like it won't be supported even on my new fire stick????",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"Terrible. Remote stopped working after 9 months.

"A great product indeed. Bought it with a discounted price and been using it for over a month now. Great connection, flawless streaming, Alexa voice integration and voice recognition rocks, remote with navigation and sound control does good job, the best part is you can sideload (legally) some useful apps and can use it as well. The Bluetooth connection option gives you flexibility to connect Bluetooth headphones/keyboard/sound bar.

"It works great. The remote seems a bit more rugged than the regular Fire TV stick remote. The only issue I have is the positioning of the buttons. The 2 rows of buttons are too close. I've ended up accidentally pressing the home button many times when all I wanted to do it pause the stream. I watch things in a dark room so I'm not always able to see the buttons. I feel for them.

"Overall I really love the new fire stick. I really like how it integrates with my tv. This even controls the volume on our older non-smart tv in a spare room. The only thing is didn’t like was that, on our main tv, no matter what we did the colors never seemed “right”. Red was more of an orange shade. I have no idea why it was like that since we’ve had other fire tv and stick devices that didn’t do that. That may just be the stick we got but we’re still using it on a secondary tv without that issue.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

I had no idea where to even start.  Install was so easy and effortless. If you are a senior afraid of technology, this is the way to go. It is not overwhelming and will give you the confidence to try even more tech.",5,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0

So many great shows and movies to watch --- NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY.Another great thing was that the way my television was designed the stick would not plug in.

Its a ""Smart Tv"" but found that it was wonky when it came to connectivity regardless of how close the router was. We decided to just buy the 4K Stick and am SOOO PLEASED!! we went from having 3 dang remotes for that tv to ONE. We had one for the sound bar, one for the tv itself, and the third was the old fire stick remote. I can't say enough how satisfied I am and how FAST IT IS!!  I was able to connect to the sound bar and control the tv AND navigate through channels on just the 4K stick itself!

"Fire stick is junk. You get what you pay for here seeing that it’s only $45-50 and Apple TV is $150+. Apple TV is the far superior product. I have all apple products basically, and this is my first non-apple device and I’m not impressed. My fire stick 4K will literally just shut off in the middle of a program. It glitches out all the time and it has nothing to do with WiFi. I’m constantly having to reboot it to get it to work. I’ve had 2 4K versions and one regular,  and they’ve all had issues but the 4K ones have had wayyyyy more frequent issues (daily issues, whether it glitch out or shut off on me) and in a much shorter time frame (1st 4K stick crapped out at 5 or so months, they sent a replacement that’s had the same problems from the get-go) than the basic fire stick. The replacement was a pain to get because amazon support didn’t believe me about the problems I was having. I’d googled several ways to troubleshoot, did everything, didn’t work, and support kept telling me to do those exact things, so it was a big argument to get sent the replacement. Save yourself the headache and invest in the Apple TV if you want a streaming device that will work.",1,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

Watched numerous videos, none of which helped, finally used a rubber shelf liner to get it open...ridiculous!No instructions included on the use of each remote button in the apps.

There's lots out there, but I still wasn't sure. I asked my assistant, and it turns out she has one and loves it. So I tried. WOW WOW WOW! Even though I have a ""smart"" TV, it's even faster now and the picture quality is even better! My apps are there: Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube, and so on.

"Held off on purchasing this because we use YouTube TV and until recently was not available without jail breaking the fire stick. So glad they reconciled because this is the Best streaming stick largely due to the remote design. Best remote for a streaming device by far, simple and clutter free with tv power volume including mute button. Apple remote touch pad can be annoying to use and sometimes gets touched accidentally, not to mention no mute button! Roku would be 2nd the volume on the side is nice but again no mute option.

"Having a ""dumb"" TV, a ""dumb"" cable box, and a ""dumb"" blu-ray player (not smart ones), our incentive to get the Firestick was to download apps that would enable Disney+ and CBS all access.

"I'm just going to say the overall quality and experience is alright. Alexa integration is also nice, however, as I was expecting, you cannot really rely on Alexa to control FireTV. Especially when you're listening to loud music, which makes it hard for Alexa to hear you.I have to deduct two starts from this device, because it is advertised as Dolby Atmos compatible, but in reality it is not. 99% of people probably don't care about this issue. Only those of us with a Dolby Atmos home theater system are affected. I spend hours trying to figure out why I cannot get Atmos working on Jack Ryan playing on FireTV, connected to my Atmos ready Pioneer AV receiver. It turns out, if your screen isn't 4K, you will not get Atmos, which is absurd. The only reason I bought FireTV 4K was because of Dolby Atmos. My projector is only 1080p. I don't want to upgrade to a 4K project that would cost me a few grands to listen to Dolby Atmos. Apparently Apple TV 4K supports Dolby Atmos on Amazon Prime, which is pretty weird.",3,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0

And our cable bill did not include any of the premium channels, and maybe half of the regular channel programing.

The Firestick did not exhibit that problem.,5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
This little stick works great IF you connect a LAN cable to the device. As far as Wireless ............ FORGET IT. You need to place your modem / router RIGHT NEXT to the stick for it to work without buffering. I am VERY disappointed since I was TRYING to eliminate WIRES going across my living room floor. IT's VERY difficult to hide ANY wiring in my attic .....  I DON'T have one and I bought this Fire stick for the WIRELESS feature. VERY disappointing.,1,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
This product is currently the best in it's class as well as just above it's class. From the price range of $20 to $150 only one device comes close which is roku and it's still behind a decent amount because of the lack of support for APK's. I hated my first firestick. I wrote Amazon a nasty review about it. I love this one! Replaced 2 expensive android boxes and one roku device for it. If I was Amazon I would continue to improve on it. It needs more ram and a gigabit ethernet. Gigabit ethernet is the way of the future. The demand is there!,5,1,2020-1-10,1,1,0

The remote does not work half of the time to turn the TV on and off or will just stop working during daily use (I have changed the batteries and that was not the issue). The 4K one has become more of a hassle than anything else - my original Fire Stick from years ago works better than this one does. :(",2,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
Love the new remote with this 4K model - no need for using 2 remotes with tv and fire stick.  Good investment especially when you are ready to cut the cord to cable and add free apps for viewing tv.  We are not hooked tv watchers so the firestick programs and apps work well enough for us instead of paying high priced monthly cable and satellite prices.  We just ordered a 2nd one for our downstairs tv.,5,1,2018-11-18,1,1,0
"There is nothing wrong with an Amazon firestick, however recognize it is primarily designed to to sell and promote Amazon. Alternative devices, such as Roku, are much more neutral as to content providers. As such, a Roku is a better streaming device because it can search across all apps for program availability.  What this means for the user is that desired content may be available for free elsewhere, something you would never know with the Firestick.",3,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0

It's faster and smoother, handling 4k content without any problems. It also supports all sound standards. Amazon might have upped the storage or added a micro sd slot but well this product is quite a bargain to begin with and the lack of such inputs can easily be remedied with the help of a 3rd party otg cable.",5,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0

It wasn't the TV settings as you could hear the ""click"" of selections on the TV menu via the TV internal speakers or the soundbar.  Both times a ""restart"" of the Fire Stick solved the issue.

"The Firestick 4K has fantastic image quality, actually better than our expectations. I even tried it on a 10 year old plasma tv and it looks fabulous. But the reason for only giving it three stars is the obnoxiously intrusive, ever present Amazon advertising that permeates the Firestick interface. The fact that I am already paying extra to be an Amazon Prime subscriber should give me the right to turn that crap off. (And if you were wondering, yes, we did opt out of personal ads, etc in every possible place which the Settings function allows.)Alexa is more intrusive than helpful, and the steady diet of onscreen ads and “suggestions” is beyond annoying. It’s bad enough to be bombarded with advertisements all day on my computer.

I purchased the Fire stick 4K in hopes of replacing a rarely used cable box, but had to purchase and add another Roku so I can stream and watch my cable tv subscription.

I am extremely happy with my firestick. I love the way the apps lineup across the top and it's easy to find what you are looking for. I downloaded YouTube TV as my main television app and I'm very happy with that and I think the picture quality is incredible through the fire stick. I've got the fire stick 4K and I was so happy with it in my living room that I got rid of my Roku in my bedroom and I bought another firestick. I got rid of my cable because they're prices were outrageous. I love the fact that I've got your Amazon channel your Amazon music and your Amazon website. I am extremely extremely grateful to have this device. I'm upset with myself that I did not get them sooner. so I have not set the one up in my bedroom yet because unfortunately I bought a new TV and the remote is broken and I have to wait for another one so I can redownload my apps in there as well. I am told that once I do that that Amazon prime will also communicate with my bedroom app as far as Amazon goes. I hope this is true. The picture quality is incredible and I give it five stars all the way down and your customer service people are incredible. They are knowledgeable and they are very polite and I'm also very happy with that. So thank you very much for this incredible device.,5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0

"I have multiple android boxes (nvidia shield tv, mi box 3,...) and two fire sticks of previous generations and so far this my new favorite way to consume media from streaming services or my NAS over the internet, has a good wifi adapter, it is really fast and responsive, the controller is able to control my smart tv and the fire stick at the same time, Alexa is still really good at following speech commands but my favorite feature is the addition of a power button to the controller, that way I can turn off both my tv and the fire stick at the same time. I highly recommend it.",5,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
"As expected, the Fire Stick is an excellent product but the Wi-Fi speed at the high router speed suggested  could be better.  My Wi-Fi is a commercial 200 Mbps service. I haven't noticed any buffering problems. The Firestick is located about 10' from router. Connecting to the router with my PW info was easy.Programming is easy. I like the volume control feature. I have a Firebox that requires the use of the TV volume control.",5,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0

This device plus Hulu help me to eliminate my cable service and the TiVo devices I was using.  I saved a lot of money and am having a much better experience.  Its also nice not to have any more boxes sitting out since this fits neatly behind the TV and does so much more.,5,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
"I upgraded from the original Fire TV Stick to the Fire TV Stick 4k and I am glad I did. It is more powerful and streams much better than the original. I paired it with a UGREEN Ethernet Adapter and so far so good. No buffering issues at all, just good quality streaming.

Not sure why, but after messing around trying to get a decent picture for over an hour,  I eventually needed to do a hard restart on the tv to restore the normal excellent picture quality.

"I live in Ecuador, and I read carefully all the available info before I bought this device. They said it works outside US except  for some content (like channels). Once I configure it, the third party streaming apps (Netflix, apple, etc) work like a charm. The problem apears with my amazon prime video subscription (really absurd since the manufacturer is the same provider of the streaming service, it should be native). No matter how many times I try to configure it, it always shows a geographical error and wont let me see my favorite movies and series. I tried contact amazon support center and they said that i should have bought the basic edition, and that the 4k editions does not work outside US (thats not what the product page says). My prime video membership work fine in any other device I have, my cell, my apple tv and smart tv. It's frustrating that I can not watch it in the provider' device.If you live outside US and want to see prime video, DONT BUY THIS DEVICE.",2,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"Can't be without them.  We have one for all of our TV's.  The voice recognition is a must have for us.  And we like having the volume and ability to turn the TV off using one clicker! We dropped cable and don't miss it at all.  But when our power is down, we do miss viewing our TV using the Amazon Fire Stick! Usually our generator would run one TV, but something went wrong this last outage, but we'll get it fixed. At our age, this is our entertainment, so it has to work.  We recommend the Amazon Fire Stick to everyone we talk to!  Thanks Amazon!",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"Bought this to bypass using the smart TV features and apps on a 3 yr old Vizio 4K TV.  Seems like over time even with updates, the connectivity of the TV and functionality of the onboard apps were lacking.  I have fiber optic internet that runs consistently at over 300mbps and a brand new router that can handle up to a gig but the TV always seemed to have issues staying connected and properly loading from apps etc.  This is my second firestick but first in 4k.  All problems solved with this little gem.  Alexa response and search feature is great.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"This is a great product that will improve your TV experience especially if you have an older smart TV that doesn't have all the apps you need and/or can't add them.  I have a Vizio 1080p from a few years ago and the processor inside is sluggish making surfing on You Tube and other apps a tedious process with it being so slow or not responding to the command at all.  Forget all of that headache as the processor in this Firestick is much, much faster and you can select and start apps with no hesitation at all.  You can easily add apps and the remote and voice recognition  is straight forward with Alexa not picking up your voice at times, but not enough to be annoying, hence the 4 starts there.  The stream quality is great and I don't even have a 4k TV and the picture is wonderful.  I'm glad I made the investment in this product and it gets a big thumbs up from me!",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

Most pragmatic solution to have voice search support on youtube, netflix, hulu etc. On top of that the interface is very fast. I liked roku interface, but when switched to vizio, I found the interface to be very slow. Also, it did not allow me to download any new app. So, I had to rely on chromecasting which I am not a big fan of. Now all my issues have been addressed by this amazing firetv interface.

"This device is great, it combines all my services into 1.  I have netflix, movies anywhere, directvnow, prime and now Fire Recast Tv, probably some others I'm not thinking of.  The advertisements are no different than Netflix, except they stay quiet. I have no issues with the interface, it's alot better than it used to be, and alot better than Roku, in my opinion. Everything I want is easily accessible. If you link your movies anywhere account to amazon, you can use the voice remote to access all your movies. With the Fire Recast connected, you can see what's on without opening the app. It keeps track of the last things you watched so you can go quickly back to it. The new remote is great, that you can finally turn your TV off and on and control the volume like on the Roku remote. I have all my echo's paired to the fire stick and now can control about everything except sound and power, which adding a Logitech hub or their fire tv cube to your TV, will allow that. Amazon is actually creating a pretty good eco system like Apple, where everything just works well together.",5,1,2018-11-27,1,0,0

Everything works a lot faster and smoother than previous Fire Sticks, BUT even as a paid Prime member, I browse to find things to watch only to be asked to pay more for HBO or other services.  Neat feature to download games, but some of them just blast you with ads.

Perfect!! Easy install works great. At first I couldnt get Alexa to work . Cut firestick off and cut back on . Works as it should. A week later I wanted another firestick for tv upstairs. Amazon wanted almost double price for same 4k firestick I just bought from them. I paid 26 dollars for first one. Found one at office depo for 34 dollars so I bought it there. I haven't watched my dish network since but not cutting cord just yet . If u dont have Amazon firestick 4k you need one. Love it.,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
So easy to set up and I am not a technology person.  I love it so much I ended up getting another one for my office tv at work so my kids can watch when they are here and so that I can have background music and a timer- it's like an Alexa built in.  I love this because we lost the remote for one of our tvs but don't need it anymore with the amazon fire.  Also found out I can have cable in other rooms without purchasing another box.  Fantastic.  I would highly recommend.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

"We have a 75"" smart TV that came with only a couple streaming Apps and I thought we'd try out the Fire TV Stick since we've never had one before.  I'm happy to say we should've bought this a long time ago!  This device is pretty awesome since it's got all the important streaming Apps in one place (and then some) - no need to use different remotes to flip between different streaming apps.  We don't care all that much about Alexa voice remote because it all depends on how much it recognizes what you're saying.  That doesn't matter since we don't care to use Alexa or even Siri anyway.Over all, the Fire TV Stick is the perfect all-in-one streaming remote!  Love it!",4,1,2019-9-16,1,1,0
"Best user experience of any smart TV device. Amazon got it right. Even with the best brand new smart TV I would still choose using the firestick over it for its speed, UI, and alexa/voice control integration. This is the smart TV experience gotten right. The new 4K stick has the most brilliant image quality I've seen. You can see the HDR coming through and you can see a huge difference in picture quality vs using a stock smart tv with its apps. They simply do not compare to the brilliant images that the 4K firestick produces.It's also filled with fun games plus classic Sega and more. Everything is super fast, and apps feel fully optimized for this experience. It's the first device that has gotten me excited about the future of TV. The stick is filled with entertainment, you can take it anywhere, and it is simply awesome.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
I have had Fire TV sticks for years now...and I really love them! The one I just bought is to replace an older Fire TV stick that I've had for 3+ years. The older one seemed a bit tired so I'm letting it retire after thousands of hours of use...not because it stopped working. I like that the new remote has power and volume buttons. I'm glad they decided to do that. One less remote on my coffee table is OK with me! Great product and excellent value!,5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"Works perfectly for us. We have Apple TV on another one of our TVs but it's more expensive and I wasn't sure if there were any differences between that and the Fire Stick. The Fire Stick is definitely more affordable and it works great for us. I'm very happy with this purchase. I always make it a point to read the good and bad reviews, but in this case I'm not sure why anyone should have anything bad to say.

I added 2 more Fire Sticks (upgraded to 4K) and found that the signal in parts of my house was too weak for uninterrupted streaming.  I upgraded my home wi-fi to a mesh system and now my Fire Sticks rock, they even upgraded the picture on a couple of my TV's.  I am very pleased with the image and streaming.

You don't need to buy anything unless you want locals or typical cable channels but trust me ...you won't miss them! You have to endure ads, but who isn't used to that? All you need is internet connection of at least 15 MBPS to stream. An antenna for local stations is also a great addition. I wish I would have known this sooner. Cable companies have got to be nervous as we were paying over $200 a month and now reduced to $74.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,1,0
"Pros: this thing is fast.  Streaming basically anything is great,  slight sluggish app loads depending on app size but I'm impressed.  I bought xbox one for a media hub and their closed circuit (less than stellar app selection) made it very useless for what they branded it as.  For anyone having issues with not having those long sought after apps in the app store.... Amazon had you covered.  Internet search app side loading watch a video and you should be able to figure it out. For the older generation, or less than computer savvy younger I'm sure you've got a friend with 15 minutes to spare whom likes beer.  Give them one, get a favor.  My xbox controller is compatible with it, wireless keyboards as well.  Chrome cast works with my Samsung galaxy 10e flawlessly (I use allcast).

The processor much snappier than previous sticks and Fire TV. Also very impressive DL speed especially on the 5.0 Ghz! Unfortunately the 5.0 has stopped connecting and only connects on 2.4 GHz. Other stick works fine. Swapped the 4K sticks out to make sure TV had nothing to do with it. TV connected fine at 5 on the other 4K stick. Seems to be an issue with that stick. Under warranty. Will let you know if I get hassled by Amazon.UPDATE - I was hassled & denied a return. Again said it is my fault.  Never could get this one or the other to stream in 4K despite 150Mbs.,2,1,2018-12-23,1,0,0

I purchased the Fire TV Stick with the hope of fixing this issue which it did.  I now have no problems at all.  An added bonus was the voice remote which I really like for jumping between services and fast forwarding and rewinding a specific number of seconds or minutes.  This is a great device which was also very easy to install.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0

Does need some upgrading -- for example I can't switch the Denon AVR to its ""HDP"" input, so its a little less sophisticated than the Harmony remotes, etc.  But the voice stuff works pretty well, its responsive and the picture is great.  Much better than the built in apps on the TV.One gripe -- really, no IP connector and makes us buy the $14 add-on...  Not great compared to Roku, etc....",5,1,2018-11-7,1,0,0
I will have to say Amazon gets better all the time. Our first firestick box was not the best experience. Sometimes it would freeze and restart on its own etc. It really needed to be hardwired in those early days. With each new design they have gotten so much better!!

I have had some ""freezing"" a few times, that I've never had with my Roku, but I'm also using the Firestick for a streaming service that I can't use my Roku for.

The new 4k stick with Bluetooth 5.0 has the audio lag. There have been a lot of complaints ever since it came out they either won't or can't fix it. Other than the audio issue it's great. It's faster, Alexa works better. Just be prepared for laggy audio if you mainly want to use Bluetooth headphones.",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Used this thing for over 6 months, finally replaced it with the Roku I had for a couple of years. The Alexa didn't recognize anything I asked.

"Let me start by noting that I've only been using this new 4K FireStick for a little over one month but thus far it's performing flawlessly as a streaming device connected to my 5G wifi router.  This new model is faster and has more memory than it's predecessor and seems to run a little cooler as well.  I'm powering mine via the USB port on my Vizio flat screen TV.  For the money, this thing is a bargain.  It's not an Nvidia Shield, but it doesn't cost $200.00 either.  I gave it 4 stars pending more usage.",4,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0

"This was the worst experience I ever had with a fire stick. Every time I want to watch it I would have to unplug everything and wait 30sec and plug everything back up before it works, after all that I’m watching it and freeze up and I get no sound out of it while I’m watching my show.

It's hard to believe you can get all the content, variety and quality wrapped in this small package, for such a small price. We live in a very special age where all of this is available right now. Also, it was simple to set up and start watching in minutes. If you have Alexa products in your house, you know Alexa works quite well, so the remote is an extension of the system. Add in Prime Movies, Music and other content and you will find yourself completely satisfied! No description can match the feeling you will have. Buy it!",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0

Not to mention the voice searching feature is SOOOOOOO convenient. I hate typing with a tv remote, and now we don’t have to!!!!

"Takes some getting used to, but good devise for making “dumb“ TV’s “smart.”  Remember, internet providers dampen your speed during peak usage times which can cause “buffering” on streaming.  Unplug your router for 30 secs once a week eliminates a lot of this.  They’ll (web service provider) will deny it, but they ALL do it!

I received the Fire TV Stick 4K. The setup is nice. You can define which inputs get picked when hitting the power and home button. You can define which device the volume buttons control.It's faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. I've Chromecast and Fire Stick...

"I purchased 2 of the Fire TV Stick 4k's back in November.  Hooked them up to my TV and sound bar and everything was great.  Now Last week I have had audio issues with both fire sticks.  No audio coming out of my sound bars anymore.  I didn't change any settings.  Something must have changed in the Amazon fire sticks.  Maybe an update, or something.  It's a little weird that both tv's with sound bard have issues at the same time.  I have tried factory resetting the sticks, unplugging them for a couple of minutes.  Nothing is working.  Audio comes out of the TV speakers, which are junk.  So something happened, and I may have to return these or find some other streaming product.  Amazon support wasn't much help.  I told them of all the things I have tried and they are telling me the issue must be my sound bars.  I can stream spotify through the sound bars with no issues.  Must be something with the fire sticks.",2,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0

"Cut the cord a couple months ago using an original Firestick. Upgraded this week to the 4K version. WOW. So much faster. Love the ability to control my Panasonic tv and Onkyo receiver with the Firestick controller. I had purchased a top of the line “Harmony” remote to control my complete setup, but it wouldn’t totally control the Firestick. The cost of the Harmony was about double the cost of the new 4K Firestick, and wouldn’t do what I wanted. The Firestick controller works flawlessly to control my system. The only NEGATIVE thing I will say about the Firestick is, when you shut off your tv and receiver with the controller, it should return the Firestick to home screen instead of leaving it wherever it was. This way you wouldn’t be using data all night long as the Firestick “thought” you were watching and kept streaming.",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0

Definitely definitely definitely worth the money and one hell of an improvement. There was nothing wrong with my old 1 and I really didn't want you by this new style because my old 1 was still working just fine, however, I felt that maybe the glitchy ness would go away because of the 4K capability.

Both set ups would show that it was ""on"" and it would go to the menu etc - but when the videos were trying to play it just halted. I switched to our old firestick and it worked without any issues.

I wish I could buy more but I cant yet justify replacing the fire TV box dongles I have just yet.If you don't have an Hdr 4k capable tv and dont think you need one of these to replace an early version of the fire stick, you are mistaken. These absolutely blow the original fire sticks of the water with the speed and the wifi capability compared to the earlier versions.  And if you do have a recent model tv that is HDR and 4k compatible,  definitely get one, it's one of the best compliments to your amazon prime subscription you can get.

They sent me a replacement and it did the same thing fresh out of the box. This product is a complete rip off and a waste of money. There is also the issue that the cord that goes from the fire stick to the outlet is not powerful enough to be used in a surge protector outlet. It has to go into the wall or it doesn’t work as well.

I was able to brighten the picture and get better contrast after changing some display settings on my TV. My PS4 Pro still looks a little better playing back content from Netflix. I suppose that's too be expected to some degree due to the price point difference. I've seen some other posts and suggestions from Amazon to work with HDR settings (i.e. use adaptive instead of always HDR) within the Fire TV Stick. I've tried that in isolation but it did not help. As I have more time to work with my TV settings in conjunction with the Fire TV HDR settings, I'm hopeful to further improve the quality. If so, I'll update my review again and better the overall rating. On another note, it is amazing how much functionality the remote and the stick have especially given the small form factor and low price point.

I was apprehensive at first since I was plugging the Fire TV Stick into my receiver, not directly into the TV, but it immediately recognized this and before long it was fully integrated into my TV and receiver - one click on the Fire TV remote turns all three components on/off, including volume control. Very intuitive interface, even for a non-technical person like me!",5,1,2019-8-19,1,1,0
"Of all the Streaming TV devices out there the Fire stick 4K has the worst user interface that works like a undergrad grade school studen in programming wrote.  You have to sequentially one by one click down a serial lineup insteD of being able to use a ""See All"" in a table view making for the most frustrating unit and painful hard plastic ting that traumatizes you thumb to the bleeding point.You have to deal with mixed free and pay movies interleaved throughout that only say other also watched (a sequel) or other item but they are paid movies of a sequel to what you just watched.",1,1,2018-12-4,1,0,0
I have been using Firesticks for over 4 years. Until recently I have still been using the first one I bought. I decided to upgrade to the 4K and I'm glad I did! It is notably faster and the video quality is exceptional. A Home run! One thing I suggest is if you have an internet provider with slower speeds is to buy an ethernet adapter and cable and connect it to the firestick and it will increase your signal. There are lots of videos on YouTube that will help you.,5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"I had an older model that streamed slowly and usually left me with a television image that was a choppy blur of activity.  For a time I thought it was my WiFi carrier, but when I checked that, it appeared to be fast and working fine.  So I ordered a new Fire Stick.  Now all of those problems I was experiencing with the old one are history.  The new downloads are fast and the picture is always clear as the Smith River in Northern California.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Unit tripped home circuit breaker.  Tried with two other 4k Firesticks...ok.  I contacted Amazon and was offered a replacement but it is a refurbished unit so I cancelled order.

"I have a smart TV that has apps on it, but this is so so much more user-friendly.  Everything just pops up on the main screen, you can use the voice control for deeper searches, and it puts what I watched last at the top of the list (rather than me having to scroll through a bunch of rarely-used apps to get to what I'm looking for).Also great that Amazon offered me a deal on this product when they stopped supporting my TV for the prime streaming service.  This was a nice gesture, rather than just shutting me off.  Good customer service, excellent product.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"You can download different channels/networks watch what’s listed anytime you want and if you have to pause you could go back to it where you left off at. Voice activated with a press of a button which could help you get to what ever you were thinking about watching and you could even play games on the fire stick. It’s very easy to hook up and in minutes you will be able to enjoy watch great movies, programs, news and even sports. I recommend this to anyone!!!",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"I was skeptical about this at first, but we needed it for our second TV. I must say after having it only a couple days I'm a believer! I had thought maybe the picture wasn't as sharp with the old one because our TV is getting on in years, but WOW. This fire stick 4k is amazing-the picture is MUCH sharper than before, and everything loads super fast! Downloaded apps run much faster. And I love being able to control the TV volume and power with it as well. I bought this one on sale but it'd definitely be worth the extra money even if I hadn't! LOVE IT!!!",5,1,2019-9-7,1,1,0
"I bought this to replace the no longer supported Roku based ""smart"" TV I have.  I did not really care for Roku, and Roku wanted me to purchase an updated Roku device for $69, since they no longer support my ""smart"" Roku based TV.I decided to go with Amazon instead, since this fire stick was on sale for $29, and it supports 4k.  It was very easy to setup, and even came with all possible adapters and cables needed.  I really appreciate that.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"These Fire Sticks setup so easily! I setup 4 of them in my house in 30 minutes. The only problem I had is the 4K stick requires more power than i can get out of the USB on the back of the TV and it required I purchase a longer micro USB  cord to reach a wall outlet. Also annoying is that while the Fire Stick controls my Vizio TZ and soundbar, when it starts the TV it turns on the TV speakers and i have to manually turn them off and reconnect the soundbar. Drives me crazy.",4,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0

It is a pain to change the device name, which is needed if you have more than one Fire Stick in your house.  You should be able to change the name through the the device settings, but you have to guess which device is which through the device manager (can't even view device name through its settings).  Also wish there was a way to clone all of the settings from one Fire Stick to another.  If you have more than one, you will spend a lot of time setting them up.  Amazon's game controller will also not work with this newer version - 4K.",2,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0

"This version of FireStick is way better the 1st generation. It has a snappy interface and works as intended. The only recommendation to Amazon is to make paring with a Bluetooth headphone easy. Every time you want to use a Bluetooth headphone,  you have to dig deep in the settings to connect the Bluetooth device to the Firestick, there is no other way. Also, at least for the Airpods, the headphone volume can't be adjusted once connected to the FireStick.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I’ve used a Roku for a long time and I still have the roku for when I get another tv someday because it’s really good. I honestly wanted the fire stick to cast my Ring doorbell and cameras on the tv. Besides that it’s actually really nice using the voice remote and (though I haven’t figured it out all the way) having my echo control the tv too. Sometimes it’s honestly much faster to physically choose what I want to view but when I know specifically what I want to watch, the voice remote pulls it up immediately and starts playing it. No menus or login screens or anything, it’s great. My only dislike comes from my lack of knowledge. I thought the fire stick plugged in to the tv and that was all the power it needed. I did not realize you still had to plug it in to the wall for power. Another reason I wanted it was for portability and the ability to not plug it in to the wall but that’s my mistake for not knowing that. I’ve heard you can plug the power cable into another USB port on 4K TVs but I’m currently using the fire stick 4K on my HD tv.Anyway, it’s a great device. Works well with my echo and the voice remote makes some things a lot quicker and simpler. I would definitely recommend it",5,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0
"This took a while to set up because it didn't fit well on the back of the TV and it made it look like it was physically connected when it was not. Once it was set up and working, it works well for the services that are available.  As of this writing there are a coupe of streaming services that are not available.  It would be nice to get internet services without downloading another app - seems like that should come installed on the device.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"First im sitting and watching my Amazon firestick and it goes completely out, I unplug it a numerous amount of times only for it to still come up and get stuck on the ""firestick tv"" screen so after a couple of days of trying everything I could as well as trying to contact Amazon I break down and order a new firestick that was set to be delivered today. When the delivery driver pulls up I go outside to wait on them at the door, only for them to drive away. I keep tracking my order status and see the truck getting further and furthe from my house and the delivery time keeps being extended. Finally I decide to do something so I find a chat feature, as Im chatting with the associate trting to figure out why my order was outside and now it says I wont recieve it until the end of the day, the associate updates my order to say I requested to have it delivered another time. Whrn questioned about it they ask me am I willing to wait until tomorrow, I mean what else can I do, follow the driver like what can I do!?! Im finally able to get through tonspeak with someone well actually have them call me and they are on the other line laughing and saying they cant hear me, im furious, I have never had an issue before and I usually dont leave reviews but I could not let this one go..

"I purchased the original Amazon Fire Stick when it initially came out. I've had it for years, and despite any flaws, I really enjoyed it. But, about a week or so ago, my guy finally gave out. While I was sad, I'd had a good run, and I was excited to have the opportunity to buy the latest Fire Stick 4K.However, within a week of purchasing it, the remote was already completely busted. It no longer recognized there were batteries in it, and despite resetting the system to factory settings, the remote was done. While I do give Amazon customer service credit for sending me a replacement as soon as I notified them of the issue; I am ultimately disappointed their product broke so easily with minimal use in the first place. Hopefully things will go better with my new remote, but it does seem like the newer Amazon devices have a lot of issues.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
I was tempted to go for the less expensive stick and I am well pleased that I did not. I do not have a 4K TV yet but the functions of this unit are superb. I have loaded KODI and several other streaming apps and they work great.  I have a 60Mb network with good coverage and my older stick works well but must be closer to the router for best performance.  This one is several rooms away and reception is great.  Minimal buffering and good Bluetooth connection to my headset. Well worth the extra money.,5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
"I was motivated to purchase the new Fire TV Stick for a several reasons.  A popular streaming service that I use seems to have difficulties with frequent buffering live programs such as NEWS when using an older interface.  The new stick is much improved and seldom has buffering issues.  The stick is fast too surfing and loading channels.  The new remote includes power, volume and mute controls, a huge improvement.  Now I don't have to pick up a second remote to change volume, mute or turn the set on or off.  This was a nice upgrade, particularly during Black Friday.",5,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0

"The device is advertised to have a bunch of channels (ESPN, NFL Sunday Ticket, AMC, ect.). NO, not at all. You have to have a cable service (DTV, Comcast, Xfinity), to get them. So what is the point in this? I thought maybe I could purchase just those channels and watch them. Nope. You have to sign into a cable service to get them. I gave it two stars, because it was super easy to set up. That is it. Even the user face is odd. It is like going in and out of apps and to get out of them, isn't easy.

"4K FireTV stick was a nice upgrade from my 2016 model year Rokus. It's much faster, works with Alexa for my most used app, YouTube TV, and the remote can control my older Yamaha AVR. Unfortunately, no matter what audio setting I try, the 4K FireTV stick locks 2-channel audio in a way that prevents me from using my AVR to process it for a surround sound effect. The 2nd-gen FireTV Stick doesn't have this problem, nor does my older Rokus. I don't know why Amazon hasn't fixed this yet.",3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

Picture quality 👍🏾, the fact that you only have to use one remote 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾.

"After some initial delivery hiccups (delivered to the wrong address! endless delays, etc.) I finally received my Amazon Fire TV Stick. I've had a chance to use it for several days now and I must say I am quite pleased with it. Excellent Netflix implementation aside from the seamless Prime Video integration of course. But what surprised me the most is how well it performs as a platform for Kodi. Wasn't expecting that but it definitely made this purchase even more worthwhile.  Sadly some apps would need to be ""sideloaded"", but it's no big deal and the process is pretty straightforward. A definite must-have for streaming aficionados and cord cutters. Highly recommended!",5,1,2018-12-5,1,0,0

I found that resetting the Fire TV Stick 4K solves the problem.",4,1,2018-11-27,1,1,0

I hooked it up to the living room TV which is a different brand and the remote instantly worked with it to my surprise. Just for the heck of it i pointed it at my soundbar and it actually worked. I was shocked. The IR blaster works great from any angle in the room and you don't have to point it directly to a device for it to work. It's also about 50x faster than her previous firestick. It's about twice the size, but that's fine with me since it's hidden behind the tv anyway. Surpassed my expectations.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
We went with the fire stick because roko starting charging for their service. We were disappointed in Roko. We couldn't get the roko to work and the reason was they wanted money. You wouldn't believe what roko put us through (over an hour on the phone) till they got to the money part. We had roko and were just going to add another device. What a nightmare dealing with them.  We also had fire stick and we hooked it right up. No problems like roko.,5,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0

"SLOW and buggy.  Too many details to wxplain why it is buggy, so will just gice a few examples.  I have soent the past hour trying to watch netflix on my firestick.  Everything (!!!) is set up right.  I can stream cbs, hbo, and hulu flawlessly, but each time I open the netflix app, my fire stick freezes and then doesnt even turn back on after I turn off my TV.  I like the fire stick design and how it has its own remote (this is why I bought it over a chromecast), but it is far too inconsistent and buggy for me to recommend to anyone.Edit: Now it is just terrible.  Everytime I try to watch something on the cbs app, it is incredibly slow or nothing loads at all, so I have to redownload the app and re-sign in everytime I want to watch something.  This happens WHILE my internet is fine and I can stream whatever I want on netflix or youtube, hulu, etc.  i hate this thing so much and wish I never bought it",1,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I purchased a Firestick locally and installed it easily.  It works well but I was misled abt the hundreds of channels that would be available to me as well as what would be available to stream.  Firestick touts ""free"" apps.....yes they are free but every channel charges and I learned after the fact that I must have a ""tv provider"" which is just a cheaper cable company.  I guess they do not understand ""cutting the cord"".  I felt that the hype over Firestick is very misleading.  It does NOT give me access to the many channels promoted unless I pay for each channel and who wants that?  Not many.  I have Netflix, prime and basic Hulu.

It's just down right annoying.  I read the older models have the ethernet connections and don't have this issue.  My connected devices are 2 to 3 times my wifi speed.  I hope Amazon brings back this feature on future models.",3,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
I have the old fire stick (no 4K and no Alexa) previous to this latest  4K version. I could not use the older version in my living room because it was too far from the router and there was a lot of lag. I purchased this because my friend said it was new and improved. Took a risk and it works! FYI this new 4K is bigger than the older fire stick. Maybe this increased hardware (and software) have improved the performance? In any case love it!

"Nice streaming device.  Like the 4K picture, very clear.  A little difficult to navigate with the remote.  Voice command works half the time.  Its cool when it does, aggravating when it doesn't so I usually just use the remote.  Tried the amazon TV stuff, way to many amazon commercials.  I stream to not see commercials.

"I like this device, the remote is responsive, the feel of the remote is great(the controller feels great too) overall it’s a good experience. However some suggestions, I don’t expect this to play Triple AAA titles such as GTA, Super Mario Odyssey, etc. but I feel like releasing a gaming controller for it, can be a little misleading cause I feel like the games are lackluster. To me there is only about 4-6 good games and 3-4 are very popular(Sonic CD, Sonic the Hedgehog, Crazy Taxi). Like I said I don’t expect it to have heavy gaming but I feel like adding or connecting it to the Google Play Store would be ideal(such as the mobile versions of Roblox, Fortnite, etc).Now the last two suggestions is this, I would love if the streaming service VRV would make its way on to the device. And I would also like if you make the effort(if possible) to put the upcoming(upcoming in the rest of the United States), a Streaming Service called Shadow Gaming which allows the user to play games on any device and i’m Talking good PC games for people who can’t afford a gaming PC.

I was relucctant to try Firesticks. I had used Chromecast but it did not always work and didn't with Disney Plus so I tried a Firestick and it has been fail proof and terrific for TV. So many apps I can hardly believe it. I don't think I have even seen them all. I like the voice but it has not always worked for me on the remote.

I'm sure if you have a keyboard or something similar you'd fly right through. The picture quality is great.  I love the simplicity of the remote and the fact it controls both the Fire Stick and the t.v., no need for mutiple remotes.  Haven't used the voice feature yet so can't comment on that.

I like the Fire Stick. It is fast and smooth. The only problem for me is it uses a lot of data. You can only set it at 720 p or higher.  . I am retired and watch a lot of shows. I was using 46 GB of data per day. If I got that much everyday I would use 1300GB per month as I am only allowed 1024 GB I would have to pay extra. With my Roku 3 you can set your data any way you like using the special code. So for the same amount of show watching I use 17 Gb per day a little over 500GB per month. So I gave the Stick to my son for Christmas. If you only watch a little or have unlimited data then this would be an excellent product.,5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
Had the original since the day it was released. Apple TV isn’t compatible with the original. Upgraded to this (which has Apple TV). Seems to work well and maybe better video than the original. Nice to have the voice feature. It makes searching much quicker. It was a good price and I was able to trade in the old one for 20% off this one.

I don't ever need to pay for cable tv again, because there are plenty of free apps available for the FireTV Stick, such as CBS news, Crackle, Pluto TV, and some of the local stations, as well as an assortment of games that are free or ""on the cheap"".

You might need Ethernet connector. I bought this as our DVD player and tv I guess is outdated after 3 years and no longer accepted certain apps we wanted to watch. It was an adjustment with the lay out  once we got it hooked up but I’m really pleased with purchase. We also went from keeping track of two remotes before converting to this down to one.

Purchases the fire sticks to replace cable television. One fire stick installation went flawless the second fire stick had some issues which I was able to overcome with a little research on the internet. When activating the Disney+ app the video would freeze and there would be no audio. I tried removing and reinstalling the Disney + app with no help.  Internet suggestions was to erase the Disney+ cache and data on the fire stick when that didn’t work I looked a little longer on the internet and found a blog that suggested I go to the display settings on the fire stick and take it out of auto and select either 1080 or 720 dpi which I did and it corrected the issue. The real issue here is I have an old TV.,5,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0
"I love the enhanced video & audio (I have a smart Samsung tv, so my expectations were high).  The availability of so many (many free) apps and services, along with the convenience of having a simple to use remote, is delightful.  It did take several calls to tech support, as I am old and technologically challenged.  And I did not want to use Alexa (that just seems creepy to me!).  Overall, I am very pleased with the device.  Wish I'd gotten one sooner!",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"The 4k stick is a great upgrade for people with the new 4k televisions. Simple to set up, very fast response, and the new remote operates the tv power and volume buttons. I don't have alexa so I can't comment on that. But the voice recognition works great for me. I have an android box as well but personally prefer amazons operating system. Amazing times we live in that something this small can generate so much entertainment. If you are a cord cutter like myself and have a modern tv to enjoy 4k you will be well pleaed with this device.",5,1,2019-4-19,1,0,0
"I really like this product EXCEPT when listening to music. I have top speed internet, HD movies stream great, but AMAZON MUSIC has intermittent ""pauses"" (maybe something to do with buffering)... In any event, it is very annoying. Unplugging the unit and replugging back in does help sometimes, but once you leave it plugged in for a while, problem comes back. Kinda crappy that Amazon can't get their own app to work properly on their own device...",3,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"This replaced a fire stick.  The new Amazon Fire Stick 4K has buttons to turn tv on and off and volume up and down.  This is used on the main tv in the living room.  My husband watches this tv and he is extremely pleased that he only has to use one remote.  It wouldn’t work on the tv in my bedroom so I assume it is not compatible with all TVs.  I will replace the other smart TVs in the house with this 4K fire stick in the future but since it is 49.99, I will continue to use two remotes on the other TVs right now.  At least, I got daddy happy.",5,1,2018-11-13,1,1,0
"I started with the Cube but found it’s speaker lacking for our main TV.  So I moved it to a workout room TV and now use this stick along with my Echo speaker which is a great pair. We REALLY like the Alexa DirecTV skill where you can say skip ahead 2 min to get past the commercials. Also, the Blink and Wyze integrations are great to show your cams on via the FireTV 4k stick",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"I have a Sharp TV purchased in 2012. I have Verizon Fios TV as well as internet; 100 mb. Device is just plug and play. Set up menu onscreen is very helpful. Remote works very well; very quick and responsive. You can download all the usual apps; netflix, hulu, amazon prime, etc. You can also download apps for many of the channels that come with your fios TV, including HBO.  Alexa voice commands work very well.  Much faster and better picture than the cheap blu-ray player that I also used to stream video. Absolutely worth every penny.",5,1,2019-3-7,1,0,0
"Got this to replace my Chromecast and could not be happier. Never have to deal with the sluggishness of 'casting' apps, everything runs directly from the stick. The remote was easy to set up, and with the new volume buttons, it's the only remote I need.Apps, movies, TV shows, all easy to find and save, really beats googling cast compatible apps.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,1,0
"We transformed our older flat screen TVs into great streaming venues with these Fire TV Stick 4K devices.  We got Disney+.

"We recently upgraded our Firestick from the 1080p to the 4K during the blackfriday sale. $25 for the 4K firestick was a steal and we couldn't pass it up.It's a bit larger but comes with the voice remote and a HDMI extension dongle. Please note that your TV either needs to have a 5v USB port or you will need to connect the included micro-USB cable and power plug to the wall in order to power the firestick. Awesome product, easy to use, fantastic resolution, would highly recommend owning at least one!!!",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,1
"I like the amazon firestick and have 3 of them. However, after awhile, the Hulu app would crash after only a few mins and bring me to the firestick homepage. This has happened with every one of my firesticks. All other apps work fine.Its only hulu thats effected. So, now I am forced to use the built in app on my roku tv for hulu. I can no longer use the alexa feature this way and the buttons on my tv remote are obviously different. So until I hear amazon has corrected this, I wont be purchasing any more firesticks.",1,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"Traded in a very old fire tv for this one. I own two and like that you can finally adjust the volume with the included remote. I gave Voice and Alexa rating a 3 as I have never had very good luck using them. I either get so dumb answer or the ""um, I don't know that one"". For me, sometimes it works and sometimes it takes three or four time, and heck I can use the remote faster than that. But in the end I love my Fire Stick and Fire box.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I previously purchased the non-4k Fire TV Stick, but was sad to see that it didn't eliminate my other remotes. When I discovered that the new version not only had 4K capability but that it could also control my soundbar, I was sold! Everything turns on with this one remote. No more switching back and forth between remotes. Life is simple, now! If I had any advice to give, make sure you run the UPDATE under the SETTINGS tab when you are setting up your Fire Stick. Otherwise, your apps will probably not display properly.",5,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
"I thought by getting this I wouldn't have to use the Roku remote, but Amazon does not have an app for my cable  company, so I still have to use two remotes.  Not happy about that at all.  Also, when I paired it with my Echo, the sound from the TV came through the Echo instead of the TV and sound bar, so I had to unpair them, not happy about that either.  I do like the voice feature, only because it's hard to navigate the home screen on the Fire TV and it's the easiest way I can find HULU.  If I had it to do over, I would have saved my money.",2,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I have a smart tv and have been streaming Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu.  When I tried to put CBS All Access on it said I could not do it.  I decided to order the Fire Stick.  It was fairly easy to set up and it works great.  Love the Alexa feature on it.  I mostly just use the fire stick now versus the smart tv feature.  Just a great product and I'm not tech or tv savvy.  I also like being able to order streaming, movies, etc. directly through Amazon",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I was super excited for this product especially during this time where we all need to stay in, but overall it hasn't been working well. Pro is the firestick itself very easy to set up and there are plenty of options to connect to, but past that, the cons have been overwhelming.I noticed immediately that my Alexa feature didn't work at all. I also noticed in the second day of using it that it would cut to black while watching the NBC and Disney+ app, but the sound would still play. It has alternated a few times where the visual is still there, but the sound would be cut out. This is just the first week in using the product and I'm not too keen on connecting to my other streaming apps. I've used it less and less and can't really go out to return the product with the stay-at-home orders in place.",2,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
The stick practically sets itself up and adding my panasonic soundbar only took a few clicks. Didn't realize how slow the menus were on my regular Fire Stick until I started using this 4K model. Greatly reduced lag when scrolling and navigating menus. Voice Recognition is great for quickly moving between apps.,5,1,2019-5-31,1,1,0
I got rid of cable 9 months ago. I have a smart tv but not able to get a lot of apps to watch shows from different providers. I LOVE my FireStick!!  I can not recommend this enough!!!  It is so easy to install and use and could not be happier with my purchase!!!,5,1,2019-12-22,1,1,0
"I am tired of ordering electronic device that are made in china.  When electronic components are manufactured such as ICs they are graded and classified as A,B,C.. etc.  Class A grade are usually used by the military, B grand used by the better manufactures of better quality devices, causing why some devices are more expensive than other devices of the same kind. China must use ""c"" class devices because the devices they make don't last very long. An electronic device from China in my opinion is made from the less quality devices.",2,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

"The app is good, the voice control is nice, but this new Fire Stick does not stay online. I tried rebooting, unplugging, etc., even bought a replacement charger with higher amp output. Checked online blogs for other frustrated buyers (earlier versions with the same problem) and tried all their recommendations but one. The one suggestion I couldn't try was a factory reset. The system would not allow me to stay online long enough to call up Settings. The service would stay online for awhile then start a continual rebooting. What frustration. If this were a car it would have been recalled.Update to review: an Amazon technician contacted me within minutes of submitting my review, hoping to identify and solve the rebooting issue. I added the HDMI extender (which I had not been using) to move the stick away from the TV. Service was restored, although it continued to occasionally reboot which was pretty much performance as usual. So, the issue may have been overheating of the Fire Stick itself.",1,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
had a laptop connected to tv.  it kept losing its wifi signal.  took a gamble on this.  works just as i hoped.  still have cable but this is a much more convenient and more reasonable price than renting additional boxes or purchasing laptops.  i am very impressed with this product.,5,1,2019-7-22,1,1,0

"We bought it on Black Friday, returned it the same day we got it. Amazon has blocked Vudu in the app store. Vudu is the largest most popular movie service. When you buy a BluRay or 4k movie disk, the digital version, 90% of the time, is delivered through Vudu. For us, this meant most of our movies were unavailable. Amazon is at war with Walmart and Walmart owns Vudu - so the customers pay. Very hard to get the app on the stick, so much so that it makes it worth it to return this and just buy a ROKU, which has support for everything and doesn't lock out apps.",2,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0

I have been using roku for years and feel the fire stick is superior,  it's faster, voice command and like the remote better. I am able to control my tv without the original remote.  Bought this at promo price of 25 bucks, cant beat it. Last thing is I can use the tv USB port to power the stick, less cables to deal with.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

"Purchased 3 to replace DISH in a couple of months.  The epitome of Plug ‘n Play.  Literally followed the onscreen prompts and in just a minute or so, the Amazon remote was in total control.  Voice commands also work excellent but we’re still discovering the “streaming world” so we tend to use the remote to browse.  We have Prime and have added Philo ($20 mo) to get 95% of what we watch on DISH.  A TV-watching savings of over $1,000.00 per year.  Apple TV may have some advantages...we’re a iMac home, but Fire Stick 4K does EVERYTHING we need running on Windstream DSL 38-45mbit and no noticeable wi-fi degradation.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0

I have not used voice recognition or Alexa. I loved it so much though that I got this one on Prime Day for my sister to use on her TV.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE  this fire stick. Everything works just like it’s supposed to. I never have streaming problems like I did when watching prime on the PS3...

And it works way better than the one from BestBuy store. Thank You So much for your help Amazon you have made me a happy camper!Although I hope Amazon will make a New Fire stick that takes a micro sd card for extra storage and put a reset button on the stick.

Piece of crap. Everyone is having connection problems. I had an older firestick and it started having connection problems. Someone suggested upgrading to a 4k firestick. Same problems. Must be software. Plugged in the 4k and it won't stay connected long enough to update the software. I've done all the trouble shooting just like everyone else. Absolutely worthless. I'd like to give zero stars. No redeeming qualities. Don't waste your money.Update: Amazon customer service was wonderful. They tried to help and then agreed to a refund of this item I bought 6 months ago. I purchased a basic Roku instead. Setup took 10 minutes and it works perfectly.

The only fly in the soup was the inability to find a Spectrum TV App to load successfully on the firestick.  Before buying, I thought I was thorough enough, and found a couple mentions of the Spectrum app associated with the fire stick, but after giving it a try, and going back to these sites, it was down further into the sites that it became apparent that this app is not running on the firestick yet.

"Ordered the New Fire Stick 4K... Supposed to be a plug and play... This TV is mounted in Master bedroom 9’ up on wall. Ladder out and Installed as directed. Nothing came up on HDMI 3, which is where it is plugged in to the back of the TV. Called Technical Support. Re-Booted and it turned on. Tech support also told me that I should plug into HDMI 1. Why? I have Direct TV on HDMI 1, Apple TV on HDMI 2. While on phone, Fire Stick goes black again. Reboot again, climb ladder and rebooted for 2nd time. Comes back on. Then completed registration finally. Everything seemed good, and then hung up with tech support. Yep, turns black again. I start researching online. Apparently, the Fire Stick doesn’t like any other devices plugged into a TV. Call friend who has a Fire Stick, who told me to get, and he then tells me that they have to plug in Fire Stick and unplug other devices when they use. Then, if they want to use a different devise, they have to plug that in and unplug Fire Stick... Really?

The Fire stick works better than the Roku stick I previously used. I have less issues with connectivity and less problems with certain channels. The home screen is user friendly. There are many app options to add. The voice remote works pretty well. My experience with the Roku remote is that I often had to repair it with the stick. I have not had this issue thus far with the fire stick remote. I don’t miss regular cable.,4,1,2019-8-13,1,1,0
Upgraded to this newer version of Firestick TV and it works great. Much faster & and less to no hesitation in live cast programming. Also combined Stick with the echo Dot and couldn’t be more pleased . Both work well together. And to top this off got a amazon smart plug and all work together by voice control. I just need to learn how to phrase things to Alexa.  Also nice to stream music thru Echo Dot without tuning TV on to get iHeart or amazon music.,5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"I received this as a Christmas gift. I download 3 apps: Netflix, Hulu, and Disney +. None of them play. I can see the home screen fine and can browse through titles.

They have had me restart my system and reinstall apps, but nothing works. The Alexa feature does work though.",2,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0

"Upgraded my original firestick to the 4K model.  I hesitated because I thought performance would be similar to the original.  I wasn't concerned with the 4k feature, I just hoped it would be faster... and it is!  Lag time has gone down dramatically and it operates much smoother.  Only downfall is this model will not power solely from the USB on my TV which the original version did.  I guess the processor uses more power, which was to be expected.  Glad I bought when they had a promo to upgrade.",5,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0

Didn't realize they had movies titles on there on the main pages, thought just apps that I would have to download so my kids wouldn't have that thrown at them. Dang.

You can even take your pictures and show the on the TV. I guess I am dating myself but when I was young my father would setup the slide projector on a table, pull out the screen and set it up.

Bought ours on Prime Day. Got a great deal! I love the available apps. I was tired of using older versions of Netflix and Prime apps that are built in to our TV.

"A miracle has occurred after 30 years of frustrating universal remote expectations and programing issues Amazon walks on water with their new fire stick. I purchased this as I have cut the cord with cable. With the new Hulu app I get live local TV and news programing which is important to my business. Upping my bandwidth to 1gig at Century link for $75 plus $50 for Hulu replace a Century link bill of $258 a month. Two of my TVs were semi smart and could not handle the HULU app with Live TV so instead of buying a new TV I thought to try the Fire Stick. OMG these old TVs are like new now. This will make your old dumb or semi smart tv NEW! But the best part is universal remote heaven. It just works with you set up, no programing codes pushing strange buttons many times to see if it works. Then I gave it the real test pulling it in to my Stereo the runs to my TV.

It's now my master tv remote.  People complain about the ""in your face Amazon products"" but I don't notice it, or maybe because I do use Prime and it's actually helpful for recently watched Prime shows to show up on the home screen.

Second off and lastly, Alexa works way better on the 4K definitely see the difference in the quality. Love it.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,1
"We have recently cut the cable tv cord.  Using Sony’ Streaming apps, prime video and a few free apps we are saving $$$ and getting everything (more than) we want.  The amazon fire stick really ties everything together.  Component audio, several TVs and all the services and apps.  Voice control of channel selection, movie selection, and service source is brilliant and quick. The fire stick is everything I hoped for and more.",5,1,2019-5-2,1,1,0

I thought this was going to be an upgrade from Roku....BOY was I wrong. We cant even access our local news stations with this. Pretty much EVERYTHING requires a TV provider. I thought that was the whole point of these type items....to avoid a TV provider,2,1,2019-11-20,1,1,0
Ok so this is my second fire stick and let me tell you that the remote dying makes it soooo not worth it. The remote on my first stick died after a month and never worked again. The remote on this fire stick sucks the life out of batteries like crazy. The actual streaming service of this stick is nice and I have had no problems other than somewhat slow loading between apps. Installation was super easy and I appreciate that. I think next time I’m going to go with a different provider such as Apple TV or Roku or something.,4,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"Luckily, I had another Fire stick (much older) that I was able to replace it with from another room. And also, because that one worked I could stop trying to trouble shoot the faulty one.I would have just ordered another one but I contacted customer service because under product support it said that replacement may be possible through Nov 16, 2020. I was literally waiting 5-8 minutes between every exchange on the chat. On with them for like 45 minutes glued to my computer. Even then they would not acknowledge that it sucked after breaking in 8 months. So a company like Amazon does not even offer a prorated price for a new one? Throw a customer a bone for a 20-25%discount on a new one?? Something for my waste of time with their representative? I may have to wait a day or two before I order anything I'm so mad.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"The Firestick offers a lot of different channels -- nearly every one I could think of -- and the interface is very user friendly and clean. My only complaint is that if my wi-fi goes out for even a few seconds, I get an error screen and sometimes have to reboot the stick, test the connection, etc. I have other streaming devices (Roku) that just resume as normal during a wifi outage, but this one seems to need a reset more often.",4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Every person who has prime should get the TV stick. I watching movies that I wouldn't see on regular or cable stations. I am a big fan of film noir and there is a great selection of those movies. Also, big, big of British TV Britbox, Acorn which there is a fee but it's worth it.  If there are channels that you don't get this is a great item to get those channels. I brought two more for my other television sets, highly recommend the Prime TV stick.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"I really like my Fire Stick. The interface makes navigating between TV apps and finding content very easy. My biggest complaint is that some of the features require using the built-in Alexa, and Alexa doesn't work very well at all. Half the time she simply doesn't respond. Often she responds, but didn't hear what you said correctly. Other times, there's a big delay before she speaks, and part of her response is cut off, so you get the last half of whatever she was trying to say.",4,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"Alexa and streaming quality is very nice but this thing is so glitchy. The remote often disconnects from the device, so I have to use the iPhone app for no reason.

Go with Roku and you won't be disappointed! *UPDATE... went from 2 stars to 5+ stars. Someone from Amazon Tech Support reached out and helped me fix my problems. I wasn't expecting that because I didn't ask for it so I appreciate the initiative. My lonely review was just one in a sea of many so you know they actually care about their customer's satisfaction.

The Western Classic ICON for example appears to be only free for a short time, as well as TUBI.

Alexa was able to recognize my speech with great accuracy and it integrates with apps such as YouTube, which is great. Only thing that I missed is a better integration with cable TV (yes, I still have it) but I don't see that as a reason to give it 4 stars, as it's very specific to my needs and that kind of integration involves challenges beyond Amazon's control.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0

I would not purchase this until a fix has been confirmed.",1,1,2019-4-30,1,1,0
"The Fire stick performed very well, and so easy to set up. The only caveat was that my Mom wanted to watch local news and her favorite shows live - which means you also need an antenna. (You can just pay for a straight cable alternative, like Hulu Live TV, but that's the only other option.) We did buy an antenna at the same time. Unfortunately, I didn't know that you can look up the options in your area to see _which_ channels are actually available. We weren't able to get some key channels - but after calling one of the cable alternatives (I think it was Sling TV) - we found out it was a location issue, not the fault of the antenna (or even fire stick.) So we ended up sending the whole kit back since my Mom couldn't get the key broadcasting networks. Learn from our mistakes and look up your area beforehand if you want all the main channels, and live TV, as well. ;)",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

I haven't used the voice remote feature much but I really do like it. And I love being free of cable. My access to some streaming is more than enough for me. Plus, now I can actually play good music through an app versus those music channels cable gives.Set up in particular was a concern for me but it was so easy!

The setup was amazingly easy and quick and I love watching shows on my timeline and without commercials.  The only issue we have had is that my television will not swap back to live tv unless I remove the firestick, it seems to interpret it as an inappropriate device, almost as if I'm stealing cable and won't allow the cable box and fire to be plugged in together.  I think I get a splitter it would work, but I haven't done that yet.",5,1,2019-2-8,1,0,0

"It's pretty ok. No better than the last one, especially in voice commands, but fine all around. The big issue is with the Netflix app. Regardless of internet connection strength or your TV settings or the stick's own settings, a whole lot of users, me included, have reported bad stuttering/skipped frames consistently while streaming specifically from Netflix. This issue has been around for basically all of 2019 and Amazon hasn't addressed it, let alone fixed it. Because Netflix is probably a main app most people will use regularly, I have to knock the rating considerably for this bug. I consider Netflix unusable in this state. Perhaps some people will be able to look past the skipped frames roughly every 5 seconds but it really is cancer to my eyes. This issue appears to be limited to specifically this 4k model, not the previous iterations of the fire stick. Again, Amazon doesn't seem to care, so this will probably persist until the next fire stick comes out. Be warned.",3,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0

I’m not a tv person so I don’t feel the need to pay monthly for Cable service but I do like to watch movies here and there and this is perfect and free.

I actually work for a company who offers a streaming service, and I recommend the Fire TV Stick above all other devices for streaming. The price point is amazing, and with the device you can even program additional remotes which was a great work around for one of our clients. The poor review comes from our recent audio issues that are escalating, and the poor customer support in trying to address the issue. I am a problem solver - I don’t have time to sit on a phone waiting for someone to walk me through a fix. So I use different online resources to find resolutions and work- around a for my tech needs. Problem is, the audio issues I’m having cannot be solved. So, I go into my device and request a callback three times. Each time I get a message that they cannot call me for some reason they choose not to disclose. So today I go online, look up the customer service number and call. I receive a message and the call ends. So there you go. I am not going to recommend a product that is failing, by a company who forgets who their customers are.

It is not intuitive nor is it easy to find out what's free and what's not without going down the rabbit hole of each app. The free TV and Movies are thick with advertising and I'd rather just play through all the 'buy me bait' at the beginning and get on with it. The commercials are geared to morons anyway. Then, there is the lack of depth in the shows to watch, no way to find IPTV shows from Britain and Australia AND I can't get Hulu to recognize where I am located.

I don’t know if one of those remote covers would help next time but beware if you have small children!Other than that issue we like the way the fire stick works!

I then purchased the Amazon Fire Stick 4K for almost $20 less than what I paid for the Roku. I installed the Fire Stick on my TV & got it up & going with no trouble at all. I was then able to install the Roku unfriendly app on the Fire Stick with NO problem whatsoever. Overall, I am most pleased with the performance & operation of the Fire Stick 4K. There is just one little vice with the Fire Stick 4K, & that is the non stop parade of ads on the screen.

I rented Aquaman this weekend and couldn't even watch it all the way through because of the Firestick issues. I returned the first one for just dying. It had issues with the volume cutting out then died completely in about 6 weeks. I am wondering now what I should do as this seems to be an issue many other customers are seeing as well.

As long as you aren't too reliant on Alexa, this product is more than adequate at it's job and I would recommend.",4,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"I received the stick last week and I eagerly set it up. I can't express enough how upset I was when the remote didn't work. Exchanged the batteries, Nothing, the blue light never came on. OK need to contact customer Service, or request a return or exchange. I have set her for 2 hours trying to achieve just that. NOTHING. I am so disgusted. Trying to ""cut the cord"" and I have an appt with the cable installer on Thursday. I am not happy as anytime I have ordered and had a problem I was able to contact the seller. Not able to do that with this product, WHY?",1,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"Initially the setup was super easy. After using for about a week, the remote would no longer control the volume or tv power on/off.  I found an awesome troubleshooting video on YouTube.  After unplugging and figuring out how to clear the remote settings, I was able to pair the remote once again with my TV and SONOS sound system.The streaming speed and clarity on my 4K tv make the FIRESTICK well worth the trouble.",4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I recently decided to cut the cord.  I switched to various streaming services but didn't like the idea of having to have to use my phone to stream content, and control play, pause, rewind, etc.  The Amazon Firestick takes care of all of that for me.  It can stream every popular streaming service I care about (Hulu, Amazon Prime, PBS Video, CBS All Access, AMC, more) and the remote--with Alexa voice control built in--is as convenient as any TV or DVR with its own remote control.  I love the Amazon Firestick and recommend it to everyone.",5,1,2019-3-29,1,0,0
"This is by far the best version of the stick series. The speed improvement over the previous generations is a welcome addition. The ease of use, the applications available for the device are vast.

"Easy to use remote. Easy to setup by enrolling in what I call "" the University of  YouTube.""  Enjoyable for the 1st 3 weeks when I found that the internal memory (ROM) is limited to 5.7GB. So if you really 'sideload' the Firestick w/ too many programs--it fills up fast & you're left having to delete a few.  iF YOU DON'T connect directly to your modem/router  you may get many buffering pauses. Grrrrrr. The wireless connection also caused me many bufferings when the stick was located 3 rooms over from the modem. We solved it by moving it into the SAME room as the modem &made it wired. I'm sure the next generation will have MORE ROM for storage as well as a better chipset. Then again, the prise may rise. Thanks for reading.",5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0

Not sure if it was worth it. It has a ton of apps loaded which is good. I have had this for a few months and I don't find myself using it that much. I am not sure if its the remote thats the issue. I think I am just so used to my tv remote and navigating it is easier. I have an older TV it has some of the  older of but not new ones like Disney plus which I watch on occasion.

I am so disappointed I have been a fire stick user for ever. I upgraded to the 4K 4 months ago. It keeps freezing. I have to restart my fire stick several times to watch any shows or movies. I check my WiFi signal strength and it’s always full. I checked the software and there is no upgrade needed. Before I upgraded to 4K stick my fire stick worked very well.

"We have been a pure streaming household for 5 years now. We exclusively achieved this with Firesticks. The 4k stick was so much better (mainly the remote's ability to directly operate TV & soundbar seamlessly) that we replaced all 4 sticks on Black Friday 2018. An annoying audio sync issue when fast forwards/reverse developed for a few months that had us frustrated but a recent firmware update seems to have fixed the issue. We picked up another 2 sticks on Black Friday 2019 to have an extra in my computer bag for work trips. I now use ""my tv"" in hotels on work trips. We are very happy with the product & value it provides.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
The content provided by the Fire TV Stick is outstanding.  More available than we'll ever be able to watch - it's massive.  Huge variety of content is easy to search.  Installs easily and very inexpensive - especially when compared to the big cable and satellite providers.  Wish we had made the switch sooner.,5,1,2019-10-16,1,1,0
I love this fire tv! I’ve used a fire tv since first gen and this one is definitely the best. I also love that the remote finally has volume control and can turn off/ on the TV.My one problem- and it’s a big one for me- is that the remote itself is cheaply made. The battery cover does not latch properly so it slides right off. Not cool when you have a toddler who keeps pulling out the batteries.,3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I am once again feeling burned burned by owning this product. I originally bought 3 Firesticks for my family to enjoy. A few months after that YouTube was removed as a feature for the better part of 2019 and I had to run it through a Firefox app and it didn't work well. It has since returned, but then I read that Disney+ might not be supported right away. Luckily that changed on launch day for Disney. Once again on the eve of the HBO Max launch I'm reading that a service I preordered will available on everything except for the Firestick? Again?! Despite having all our TVs equipped with Firesticks, we will have to watch HBO Max on our tablets, or buy a different device. Absurd. As amazingly well as this device works, it's hard to recommend it when this keeps happening .",1,1,2019-9-14,1,1,0
"I really like the picture quality in 1080p and 2160 on the FireTV but I have one nagging problem, the audio. Once or twice every hour of play I'll experience an audio dropout. It only lasts for a second or so but it is very annoying. I have the FireTV directly connected to my Pioneer 4K compatible receiver which passes the signal on to an LG OLED 55E6P TV. The dropouts occur with both Dolby Surround and Dolby Atmos  playback. On the other hand I have never had this happen with my Blu-Ray player playing any of the different disc formats. I hope there is possibly a fix because  I would like to make the FireTV 4K my main streamer.P.S. This happens on Amazon Prime and Netflix",3,1,2018-12-5,1,1,0
"This is probably the best Amazon branded product we have ever bought.  Fast, slick interface.  It found a set of remote codes for a set that I never got to work with any other universal remotes, including expensive ones.  I do understand there are a few ""pixelation"" bugs in certain modes still, but I haven't noticed them.  This is my favorite streaming device, including built ins and Rokus.

"I am extremely disappointed with this purchase, I was very excited when I purchased this because it meant I was going to be Free from cable, this device fails to connect to WiFi even when the router is right next to it the connection fails and I have double checked my connection and speed. If the device needs extra cables to properly function I believe this too should be included with the initial device to avoid the inconvinience of having to spend extra money for a device that should work correctly to begin with, BEWARE if you decide to purchase this fire stick you will have to purchase additional things to make it work ... HORRIBLE",1,1,2019-3-1,1,1,0
"I love the fire tv stick 4 K. The instructions were easy to set up, plug it into one of the ports at the back of the tv and it’s ready to go. Two great features about it is unlike the older firestick version, you now have a volume up/down buttons and a mute button. But you have to set up these functions or you will be using two remotes. The firestick to go into the apps or movies and your tv remote to control the volume. So set it up, one remote and done. Also it has its own power on/off button. The Alexa voice reads your voice tone clear, ask her to look for a movie, say the name of the movie and it appears in the search box. Love it.  This is my personal opinion and not a discounted item for an unbiased opinion.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
Great improvement over the old Fire TV stick. I like the voice recognition feature and specially the fact that you have to press a button to start speaking. I don’t like continues voice recognition because of privacy issues but with the button I feel It’s safer.The first thing I noticed was at an increase  in speed. The elements load faster and the streaming quality is better. The remote is a little bit larger but now you can turn on your TV and adjust the volume or mute. I now rarely use my TV remote. I am really enjoying my new fire TV stick.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,1

My receiver like many others, is plugged into the HDMI one port on my TV  My ps4, Nintendo switch, and fire stick all plug into the av receiver so surroundsound can be played on sll devices.  When you start the set up, it asked you what model receiver you have. Then you can assign these devices to whatever input they’re connected to on the receiver (ie sat/tv, game, bluray).  It also turns on the TV and AV receiver simultaneously  which is great.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

I only had to reset the entire system (and wireless router) once so far.  I would like to know how to 100% disable Alexa...I've never used the feature, but I don't want Alexa in my home.

I have reset it a couple of times and it works for a day or so but it then it stops having issues with some buttons not responding. Sometimes the response is very delayed.The streaming is also not as fast as my old device and keeps buffering.

"I rarely write reviews but this thing is amazing! We ended our terrible DirecTV service after 10 years and instead got the Firestick to watch Netflix and Hulu live. And we have zero regrets! We already had a smart TV, but it wouldn't support Hulu live which is why we got the stick. This thing is lightening fast and loads Netflix way faster than our smart TV alone did. Its easy to setup, the remote integrates with the TV and sound bar and we use Alexa on the remote and our echo dot to search shows. I don't understand why people complain about Amazon content being pushed when you launch the stick. Its a ""header"" at the top, but the apps you regularly use are right below it, in the middle of the screen. I actually appreciate the Amazon prime show ads so I can find new shows to watch.

The 4K Stick makes everything look clear and my cousin couldn’t believe that I wasn’t hooked up to cable! It is so easy to use and I love that I can take the Fire Stick anywhere!  I am buying a new one because I am now returning two of my cable boxes and I’ll save about $80 or more a month! Prime video is great, it comes with so many options.

Excellent device. Beats my Roku. I'm running a wired connection so no streaming issues. Remote works well as does the Alexa voice commands. Only cons is some preloaded apps you may not use.

"This is the best.  4K and Dolby Atmos are what the other firesticks are missing.  Without 4K a new OLED Television is almost worthless.  It also helps overcome many of the set-up issues of ARC, and pass through associated with different OLED offerings.  This is a much simpler fix to HDMI ARC than that offered by the manufacturers.

Hate how it doesn't allow Vudu or YouTube but I like the ability to be able to side load it.  Just wish I didn't have to.  Seems to have software issues and requires me to either unplug it or restart it from the settings menu more often than I feel I should have to.  Not even my older Roku I got for free from DirectTv Now requires as may reboots as this stick. But other than that it is a good streaming stick.,4,1,2019-4-18,1,1,0
"Great picture quality and easy to set up and use. I just would like to note the fire stick is actually quite large. In the picture it looks like it might be the size of a thumb drive but it's actually almost half the size of the remote. Also, I love the new remote with volume control so I don't have to go searching for other remotes. As with the other Fire TV products I've purchase, the power cord has a usb so you can plug it into your TV's USB (if it has one by the HDMI input) and you don't have to use the wall plug. It's much neater and you don't have to worry about messy cords running from your tv to the wall sockets.",5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0
"I would give it five stars but the remote is the exact same size as the previous model. The remote is simply too small and narrow to hold comfortably in one hand. I must grip firmly so it doesn’t slip out of my hand.  Also gets lost a lot. Even on the couch right next to me because it’s so small and dark. I  really wish they would re-design the remote to be a bright color so it’s easier to find like bright orange or green; and  A bit wider so it’s easier to hold without slipping away.

"This review pertains ONLY to the home screen experience, not the rest of the product (which I do like in general, hence the arbitrary bump to 2 stars).  I have long taken issue with the promoted content on the home screen and wanted to be able to hide it, or ""thumbs down"" certain categories of content.  Too often I turn on my TV, hoping to watch something cheerful or relaxing, only to be confronted with aggressive MMA fight imagery or violent action flicks or random sports games that I DO NOT CARE ABOUT AT ALL.  Seriously, with all the preference-tracking software technology stalking our every moves, why would my Fire TV not promote something in which I might have even a tiny glimmer of interest?  I have never once watched ANYTHING like this hostile promoted content, but there it is, glaring at me every time I turn on the TV.  It's irritating and disconcerting.  But today the front page featured content is a new level of disturbing, not to mention offensive and disrespectful: ""Jesus, His Life"" by the History Channel, set to the execution scene, no less.  Charming, Amazon Prime.  Did it occur to anyone at Amazon, when deciding to force this horrifying religious promo on everyone, that some of us are NOT Christian and DO NOT appreciate being suddenly confronted Christian torture porn??  It's not just blatant religious bias, but unabashed religious presumption and discourtesy; no other religion's content would ever be so pointedly featured like this (and especially not the most disgusting moment of the whole grisly tale).  Are you kidding, a Hindu, Pagan, Muslim execution scene?  It would NEVER happen, and neither should this.  As a non-Christian myself, I find this content an insult and affront.  I could not find a setting to hide the wretched image, so I actually called Customer Service, but they could not remove the content from my TV and were zero help in addressing the issue.  ""It should change in 2 or 3 days"", the agent said.  I find this to be a totally unacceptable response, and must emphatically hope that Amazon at the very least will soon provide a setting to hide offensive promoted content, and at best might make featured content more customizable and tailored to the TV owner's interests.

We are very happy with all the channels we got. I also subscribe to sling for more channels. This was a great investment I wish I did it sooner.,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"This reminds me of Apple's statement that ""It just works"". So simple to install and straightforward to use. I bought this to support my Hulu subscription. The Fire TV Stick 4K provides a friendlier user interface on the TV and it makes channel tuning so easy. The Alexa Voice Remote makes it even easier. You can simply tell ""Alexa"" what channel and ""she"" tunes it in. This new model also controls the TV off/on and volume. It's now the only remote I have to use. Truly simple & small. If you're ready to cut the cord, this is a good place to start.",5,1,2018-11-25,1,0,0

"Bought several of these to make my non-smart TVs smart. It works like a charm! I have my Prime, Hulu, YouTube TV, etc. The only thing Alexa is lacking is the Spectrum TV app - they really should develop one. I would have bought a Roku had I known that Alexa was missing this app and yet Roku has it. Oh well - otherwise, Amazon Music and Amazon Photos is right there and easy to use too. Really do enjoy using the Fire Stick!",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I have been using Fire TV for over 5 years (first generation). Seemed to be having some issues with internet connection, re-starts, etc. So, I thought how about trying an upgrade to the latest version of Fire TV stick. Wow, what an improvement. MUCH faster, no re-starts, no jittery program starts....  Also, nice to have Alexa & volume control integration....Well worth the upgrade if you are using an older version!",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"I spent almost more time TRYING to open the remote to put in the batteries than I did setting up the Fire Stick.  It was not easy to slide the opening of the fire stick.  I had to pry it open :(I'm very happy with the quality of the picture. Alexa sometimes doesn't know what I'm saying. It was easy to open the Prime Video app but not as easy to figure out that I had to go to the 'app' function to open Netflix and CBS All Access.  Overall, very happy.",4,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

Okay so I’ve had fire sticks forever now. I was forced to buy a new one due to the last failing. I have a tv that doesn’t have volume options or anything but on/off. I have tried tried about 20 universal remotes and nothing has hooked up to this stupid tv.  But this godly piece of heaven has volume and an on/off on the fire stick remote. And!!! It works on my tv! The fire stick itself is super smooth and works amazingly!!,5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Me and my boyfriend recently got the 4K fire stick for Christmas and we have been loving it! The quality is amazing, Alexa can find all your shows and fast forward, rewind, etc. If you don’t have cable, like us, this is the best choice to save money. We have Hulu and Netflix as well as amazon prime video so we can watch what we really love no matter what. Also you can download YouTube and whatever else you want to use.Side note, If you have a PS4 or Xbox, this does the same stuff as that minus the awesome Alexa controller/remote. But if you have an extra TV that doesn’t have a PS4 or Xbox, go for this!!!",5,1,2019-1-16,1,0,0
"This would be great if Amazon supplies the adequate power supply plug! It is quite ridiculous I had to get on Google to search and found that practically everyone says the plug that comes with the Firestick is not able to support the power supply, I have to use my iPad supplied plug! Even still during busy times it keeps resetting on both devices! Also voice integration is not great. I’m extremely dissatisfied with this product but it’s all I’ve found. I’m waiting for my Apple TV",2,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"I have been lamenting cable and satellite tv for months after moving into an older neighborhood with limited options for either.  My daughter surprised me with a Fire TV Stick 4k at Christmas and all I can say is, WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG??This thing not only is super-easy for this tech-challenged granny to install and use, but it's going to save me THOUSANDS of dollars in its first year alone.

First time I ever bought a streaming device tried to set it up 4 times I had to call customer service and they had to walk me through it and reset the whole thing took over a hour and 15 minutes but finally worked the signal strength extender that I  paid extra to get was the problemOnce I started using it I like it however it does freeze and stops working in a series or movie now and then I have to reset it by unplugging and plugging back in them it will work a day or two and I have to do it again,4,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"First of all, if you are still using the 1st gen Firestick, upgrade asap as the streaming speed increase makes it totally worthwhile. If you don't have a 4k tv, make sure you go into ""settings"" and reduce reduce the streaming quality capability, otherwise you'll probably get the ""mode not supported"" error message.

"Amazon built a high quality product at a really great price point, but boy oh boy, what a terrible user interface for the most basic functionality.The organization of the user interface is clean and effective. The problem is that it is NOT AT ALL obvious which item is active/selected at ANY time. AWFUL, totally amateurish, and easily corrected by simply adding obviously highlighting to whatever items is currently selected.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"A pain in the butt. That is my review of the Fire TV Stick. The apps on it freeze and are slow to respond. The NHL app on Fire TV freezes when you fast forward, and resume works less than half the time. Other apps just won’t load until you restart the Fire TV stick. You continually get stuck in load circle of death. The main menu is definitely aimed more towards selling you more services than ease of use. I was hoping that the user interface would be better with Amazon Fire TV. Your list of shows should be on the main menu not one you have to click over for.  Even when you go to Amazon Video your list of shows are clicks away instead of main menu. I was hoping for a better service and user experience. I bought one of these and a Roku to compare and I have none of these issues on my Roku. So instead of buying another Fire TV product I guess I will be purchasing another Roku. Amazon has a great device but they focus to much on the sale and not the customer.",2,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"Purchased fire Stick 4K with a promo code. Product came in a timely fashion, but the home button on the remote would not work.  Spent at least half an hour on the phone with the rep troubleshooting. Decided it was the remote and sent another. Received remote today and have the same issue. 40 plus minutes on the phone with the rep today and two different departments. They decide it is the fire stick that has an issue. I'm told they can not exchange it as It is a ""third-party purchase"". I remind the rep that Amazon is the supplier of the Amazon fire Stick. WTF!??? And then told their system will not accept an exchange. I'm told I would get a refund and then have to turn around and purchase the next one without the promo code, which now cost me $25 more than I just paid for the defective one. Great customer service and way to go.  By the way, spent another 18 minutes on the phone with another rep prior to writing this and although very nice, he was sympathetic but could not help me.  I'll use my old fire stick until it fails and then I will look at somebody else's product who cares about their customers.",1,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"I have an older fire stick, so I have experience with them. I have not had issues with my previous one, but I do with this new one. You will have to adjust the picture on your tv, because this one streams with a dark picture. I looked online to troubleshoot, and the best advice I got was to change the HDR mode to dynamic. If you leave it to the default, it is even darker. Dynamic mode alleviates some of this. However, the other colors tend to be a little warm on things like skin tone. I have a 2017 Samsung UHD, so this may make a difference. Newer tv's may not have this issue. Otherwise, the stock's performance is good. It navigates well and is fast. The image issues are the only reason I can't rate it higher.",3,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I finally broke down to buy this because I subscribed to Disney+ and the Fire Stick is one of the few products that works with Disney+. Unfortunately the Disney+ app doesn’t work completely. I can watch National Geographic, for instance, but not Pixar or Star Wars. The sound plays, but there’s no image (the screen is black during playback).I also use Amazon Prime Video, and while native, Prime Video’s interface is not at all intuitive. It’s a dramatic deviation from both the stand-alone Prime Video apps AND the web interface. It’s not even clear when your looking at Prime Video and not some other service.",2,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
It takes a while until the app opens with this new stick. The screen is black for at least 1 minute. The old stick (the diamond shape one) never acted like this. I have 4 fire sticks. 2 diamond shape and 2 flash-drive shape. The latest stick was a pain in the but to set-up. Didn’t work with the extender. I ordered a new extended per the suggestion of customer service ehh troubleshooting and that one didn’t work either. I borrowed the extender for the stick I already owned and that worked. So it makes me think the quality is lacking now. Is amazon just pumping out sticks without serious quality control?  That’s the impression I’m getting.,3,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I bought this to replace my old non-4K Firestick, which had become so slow that it was essentially unusable. The speed increase was dramatic and satisfying. It doesn't happen to integrate well with the features of my older flat screen television (input switching for example) but that's a shortfall of the television. I haven't messed with the Alexa integration feature much, so I can't vouch for it as of yet. All things considered, though, well worth the $.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
I wish I knew that this wouldn't work with my lipstick game remote. This has new software that doesnt allow it to connect to the Amazon fire tv game controller anymore so now that I finally have enough ram to play games better the remote no longer works so now I have an expensive almost new remote that is useless and obsolete. Thanks Amazon. Ill be more careful not to jump on board with these Amazon devices in the future and I'd suggest you find an alternative as well since they really don't care about wasting your money.,1,1,2019-9-28,1,0,1

I dumped the cable company and already had Amazon Prime so I thought why not get a fire stick.  It works well enough and gives me plenty of content.  Some of the Amazon Prime features series are very good. Not incredibly difficult to set up or navigate.  The only down side is that it will crash from time to time and require a reboot.  Not sure whether its an issue with the fire stick or Internet company.  I do like it and can recommend it to anyone wanting to dump the overpriced cable company.,4,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
I was skeptical about trying this but for some reason my tv had trouble connecting to the wifi in the house.  We plugged this in and it connected right away.  Picture had a bit of litghting problems at first but that went away and hasn't come back.  Picture quality is great and the selections are many.

"This is worth every penny! I had the original Fire Stick and was happy with it. The 4K Fire stick was even easier to install. You ONLY need this remote for your tv, as it has power/volume buttons. Works fantastic with my Samsung 4K tv. The only downside is when you're connected to your Echo Dot (etc.) for voice commands, the sound plays from the dot and not the tv. I do not have the dot surround sound system so I disconnected it. I love all the movies, shows etc in 4k.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"I was looking for a way to watch TV without cable or a dish so tried Amazon's Fire Stick TV.  After a few months of use I find it lacking in providing news station streaming with operation not always smooth and seamless.  Many of the stations have lapses in their transmission or go dead or can't load the next video.  News progremas repeat too often with not enough quality news in depth.  Maybe the Fire Stick is not for me but I will keep using it for now.  I only wish whoever programs the news station's streaming would do a much better and seamless job.  Overall I am very disappointed the more I use the Fire Stick.  What movies and program episodes I have watched have been very good but, for news, get it somewhere else.UPDATE on 2-18-20.  I have had my Firestick for quite a while now and would not change my initial 2-star rating.  When it's working it's pretty good.  The main problems have been CBS News not loading when I want it making me reset things which is time consuming.  Other news programs are not well done with many things repeating.  Youtube videos play well.  I might still buy the Firestick if I didn't have it.  It's a decent replacement for TV or cable but nothing to get too excited about.",2,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0
"*UPDATE- amazon contacted me and instructed me to do a factory reset on the fire stick. This seems to have solved the audio issue. Still having trouble with the Direct TV app, but I think (from reading reviews on the app specifically) its a direct tv issue.*ORIGINAL REVIEW- Several times a week, and sometimes twice in one day, the sound is sped up in a warped fast forward manner.  No matter which app (Hulu, DTv, Netflix).  The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug back in.  It’s a pain.  Also Direct Tv app does not work consistently.  The older firestick worked better.",4,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"UPDATE: 7/13 - Amazon tech support rep Paula called me same day as my 2 star rating post. Superior product interest and support caused me to change my rating of the 4K stick. Prob is I have two 4K sticks, and one non 4K. The internet drops more frequently, the 4k sticks overheat more frequently and restart on their own. I've tested moving the older stick around and it seems to have better quality with less unexpected stick self restarts or dropped home wifi signal.",5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0

Voice control is cool.  Just sometimes tempermental.  When we say ""Rezoom"" sometimes it thinks we are asking for the Zoom app and tells us it is not available.

I requested to speak with a warranty specialist or anyone who had more knowledge about how to resolve the issue and they weren’t able to do that either. Very disappointed with the lack of competent customer service.  I understand we’re in a time of change due to new Covid 19 procedures, but if you can take my money for the exchange of your product brand items, you should back up with quality assurance and make things right when the product fails- period- even if it takes a little longer to make it happen.",1,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0

I don't have a 4k TV yet, but my 1st gen was painfully slow to launch both itself and apps, although it streamed well.  I selected the 4k version both to ""future-proof"" and because I wanted maximum possible speed.  It was well worth it as it is much ""snappier"" and the voice search works well.  Maybe you want to be cheap and wait for a deal like I did, but if you are still using a 1st gen Firestick, I can only say ""Upgrade.""

While watching youtube videos in resolutions of 1080p and higher, the video is laggy and the audio will either not be synced with the video and/or the bass will go in and out.

I have the Roku stick which works quite well but the Fire Stick beats it for having the ability to load third-party apps and make this a dream for cord cutters.

I’m so glad that I bought the 4K Stick over the original Fire Stick. The picture quality is so crisp and clear! I love the way that the home page intergrates with shows from many different apps. That way you don’t have to open every app to browse what you might like to watch! Very good. It’s also nice to have tiny previews when you scroll through shows and movies on prime. We have Roku before this for 4 years. The 4K Fire Stick is a major upgrade!This Stick is also exceptional in setting it up with my TV and syncing the remote. I was honestly shocked at how simple it was! Great technology right here.,5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0

This model had no connection issues while using my microwave oven. It is also fast and even summoning Alexa is quick to respond. The power button is a plus but I do not use it often because I'm using Logitech Harmony remote control that only takes a single press of a button to turn on all devices at once.

"I purchased the Amazon Firestick 4K to see if it would be acceptable to access the tv streaming apps in order to  replace the high priced TV provider that we now have and switch to streaming. The HD quality is very good and meets the quality of our provider. The Alexa features work very well and I must say, better than expected. The apps are easy to access with only a few more touches then the present provider. The only negative is when you have another tv (which is also streaming the same channel) in use within listening distance, there is an audio sound program lag. All apps are easy to use. In all, the firetvstick 4k is very very good. As I continue to evaluate it, I'm sure that it won't  be long in replacing our present TV provider. Recomend. I'll keep you posted if that thought becomes negative.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0

"This is a great product.  I bought it for my Mom so she could use it with her Amazon Prime Account. Not only can she do that, but I set her up with my Netflix so she's got lots of great TV options. The only thing is that if you buy for someone else, you will need some Customer Service help to set up your gift recipient's Amazon account on it instead. Once that was done we thoroughly enjoyed it and she loves it still.",4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"I just unboxed this new Firestick 4k today, and all of my apps have issues loading and making the audio constantly skippy. I know this isnt an internet issue as I had a Roku in this TV for over a year and had no issues. Also, for those that might think it's the app I'm using, it can't be because this happened with multiple applications (Hulu, YouTube. Netflix, VRV). Pretty big bummer, as I was really looking forward to an upgrade from that Roku.",2,1,2019-7-15,1,1,0
"Good streaming tool. Easy to install and set up. Price was right also. Many choices of things to watch. If you're a Prime member, there are a lot of movies etc. One issue comes to mind. There should be a previous or back button to allow you to basically watch 2 shows or channels at a time, instead of having to perform 4 or 5 button clicks to go between Channel A and back to Channel B. That's the only thing I miss. Otherwise, I have no drawbacks. Looking forward to enhancements as time goes on.",4,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0

"i added my fire tv stick in the attic directly to my sony receiver's input it gets the content from the router's WIFI that is placed in the basement, none of the other devices work through wifi and i have a switch in the attic for them, but suprisingly the stick works perfect for all the family videos in my Nas as well as playing through hotstar and netflix and prime videos with no loss. i  have to add the setup was a breeze and it added my sony receiver's volume up down during setup and i  now dont touch any other remote than the projector and the fire voice remote. i am a very happy customer.

"Overall I am pleased with the capabilities of the Fire TV Stick.  The streaming quality is good and it has plenty of options.  I have two complaints.  One, the volume control does not work as well with my receiver as I would like.  It is slow to respond, and then, maybe because I held it too long, it  keeps  changing the volume for some time after I let it go.  The mute button brings up a odd menu, and the remote does not work with it.  I also find trying to navigate with the Fire TV Stick awkward compared to the browser on my computer.",4,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0

After using an in-laws for a couple of shows and seeing what it could do, I was sold!The remote for it is miles ahead of the ATVs!”  It was epically east to sync the remote up with our TV, Sound bar, and other devices so that we only had one remote instead of two or three. Since buying it, I’ve recommended it many, many times.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
I have had Firesticks since they first came out - have 4 in the home.  Well recently decided to move to a streaming service that the Gen1 units did not support.  So upgraded to the 4K version - these are amazing - the picture quality and responsiveness is far superior to the original units.  While I didnt want to have to buy all new ones - the streaming service savings vs cable will pay for them in less than 2 months.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"I have an Epson 5040 projector. The only problem I have is that when the projector thinks it is getting 4K one of its options is not available (frame interpolation). The Firestick4K will let me set the resolution to 4K, or another resolution, but it does not switch automatically based on the actual resolution of the material. So, I have to switch the FS4K resolution manually. All in all, not much of a problem and I am satisfied with the FS4K. As an aside: customer service is first rate on this product.",4,1,2018-11-23,1,0,0

The sound quality, regardless of any setting, is very high pitched - hardly any bass even if the bass itself is set to the highest it can go. Which never happened with Roku, and that device breaks down once a year. I'm no stranger to audio systems and this process has been a waste of time with no positive results.The interface is very unorganized and somewhat overwhelming due to the cluster of apps it shoves in your face to subscribe to.",2,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0

It is faster, so much clearer (of course I am using a better tv as well, I'm sure) and is a snap to set up since when you order it you can have it already registered at the time of ordering.I am so very happy with this purchase and will recommend it to my family and friends.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0

It's much snappier than the original, which makes for a better experience navigating and faster loading of apps.  The remote for the 4k version features volume and power buttons for your TV which is a very convenient and a welcome update.  I was impressed with the improvements overall and am happy with the product and would fully recommend it. Even if you don,t intend on using the 4K features, I now feel after having used it for some time, it's worth the extra money for a superior device.  Hope this helps.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
This is my personal review im not getting nothing for this so here we go the firestick 4k is awesome i have 3 of them in my house they perform perfect sometimes you might have to restart one but that very easy it show a prefect picture on all my tv which none of them are 4k i use them with apps that you have to side load but it very easy to do their info all over the internet about this a lot of people call them jailbroke but it as simple as changing a few setting on the stick then they want to charge you double for this dont fall for it i use mine with mediabox hd and you tube tv which is great they perform perfect so i really like them a lot also the 2nd gen one with voice and volume controll work just as well get you one get rid of that high cable i split my you tube tv service with my brother its cost us 27.50 a month each great deal.i only have like 20mb cable its works out great .,5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

With that said purchased this tool which arrived the next day, packaged nicely with directions for use.

The Alexa ""voice"" button stopped working after the second click but Amazon was really nice about simply sending me a new remote.

Works great picture and sound quality are perfect. If you don’t turn it off manually it will turn itself off after a few hours. It is then locked up and has to be rebooted by unplugging and replug in the power to the fire stick. Other than that works perfectly. I have Apple TV also but prefer my fire stick because of the remote. Apple TV remote is way too sensitive and the fire stick remote works great and easy to use in the dark.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0

It is also very washed out like it's in a fog.  I played with the settings to no avail.  The picture is much better, more crisp with the older stick.  I also could not get the audio in sync with the video when using Playstation Vue.  It worked better on some channels over others, but again, no matter what settings I used, I could not get it to work.  All in all, I feel this is WAY too much work to simply watch TV.

I bought this bc I had a really old model. I think my shows stream faster on this one and more reliably. My older model didn’t have a lot of memory (not sure if that is the difference) I don’t notice a difference in pic quality.The win for me is the remote. I only have to use ONE remote. I no longer have cable or a smart tv so it’s nice to only have one remote.

No instructions on needing a separate switch box to manually switch between TV and the Fire Stick.

I like this new version of fire tv stick because it is fast and has the volume and power button which integrates with the tv. I used to have the old fire tv stick but I did return it because it was slow and I bought the fire tv which is more faster. I bought this because it was on sale and has a coupon code so I told myself that it is time to upgrade.

"Second update September 2019: the second device that amazon sent in place of the original dud is now unusable. What started with sound problems, that could usually be remedied by turning it off and on or switching to tv and back, now can’t play anything with the sound and picture matching. It skips, interrupts, and won’t fix anymore by switching to tv and back to reset. Still a waste of $50. My original fire sticks on the other TVs work just fine, it’s just this horrible updated 4K stick that has problems. So disappointing. The second worked ok for a while, but 7 months later and it’s trash.Update: my first was faulty and amazon replaced it right away and sent me a new one. The second device is so glitchy! I am constantly having to turn it off and on again to reset it to play anything right. It’s frustrating and is a waste of $50. My other two non- 4K firesticks work fine in our other TVs.

It does work with all of the streaming services that I use, and as a bonus there's even an app for Audible on it. I will say it does occasionally stop connecting to the Wireless Network, but when that happens I just restart the remote.

I don't use the voice remote very often, as I don't have an Echo in my home but I can see how helpful it was.Oh and as my favorite bonus! It connects to my sound bar too!

I dunno if I got a lemon or if it is an issue with this model.",2,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0

"Even if you don't have a 4k tv, this firestick is worth having. It is way faster than the original firestick. The performance it gives you, provided you have reasonably fast internet, is definitely worth the purchase. I got one before I even purchased a 4k tv, and I was very happy with it. Now that I have a 4k tv, I am getting the total experience and am very satisfied. I bought a second one just to take advantage of the $40 deal even though I only have one 4k tv. The remote is awesome! I really love that I can ask Alexa questions and have her answer it with voice and also visually on the tv screen. You can ask Alexa the weather, and she tells it and shows you a forecast on the screen. If you are watching something at the time, it will interrupt the media you are watching and then return to it when she is finished.Having this Firestick with the speed and functionality and being mobile too...just a super deal. I love it and highly recommend  it.",5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0

"Turned off cable and got Firesticks for all our TVs.  Love it!  The voice option is great.  Whole system, set up etc. is a no brainer.  Very easy to set up and very user friendly.  Easy for adults and children.  Fast streaming, excellent pic quality.  So many viewing options including free movie apps.  Still get our local channels and local news via HULU Live at a huge savings compared to our past cable bill.  What is not to love when you have so many viewing options and save money!

"I was originally looking to purchase a Roku after switching over to Sling TV and finding out that it doesn't play nice with chromecast. Then Prime day came and I couldn't pass up the $22 bundle with the Firestick 4k and echo dot. The Firestick is easy to install, set up and use, and also supports a large number of of apps. It's been great for Sling TV, which is the main reason for my purchase. The interface leaves a lot to be desired unfortunately. There is no place where you can simply look at a list of your installed apps and choose one that's not cluttered with other apps you don't want and/or shows that require Amazon video or a purchase.  It's also missing a way to search for something within the services you have installed. It's inconvenient to have to open each app individually to try and find something specific. Overall I think it's good hardware with software that needs some changes. I still miss the chromecast sometimes and it's ability to handle anything I send to it (except Sling)",3,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
I love firesticks!! I have multiple in my home and also have bought many for gifts. They are a great streaming device and highly customizable with the right applications. This is the best model I have tried so far. I have not had the privilege to get my hands on the cube yet but maybe in the future. If you don't have one of these on all of your TV's you are missing out. They integrate very well into my many smart home automations and smart devices as well. My ring doorbell also works flawlessly with these.,5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,1
"I am not tech savvy, I still miss my vcr. The major reason I bought the Fire Stick is to play my library of purchased movies and TV programs. This is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5. I HAD to buy the Fire Stick to be able to access the programs I supposedly own.  That really aggravated me. I know that the Fire Stick is capable of doing much more than I am asking of it. I learned to play my downloaded music and audible books. So I am coming along.",4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

You'd think they would have it on the firestick as well and I am really pissed off and upset because that is the one channel i watch and I'm not going to pay a subscription on the live tv apps just to watch it when my dad gets it free on the 4k tv fire. The only reason I got the firestick was for that reason only. To watch the CW channel live because I dont have cable.

"I thought that Roku was the way to go, for years, until I recently purchased the Fire Stick 4K.

"Excellent quality, sound used Amazon's firestick tv extended hdmi fast speed cable to connect firestice to my Integra 5.2 Home theatre. Using 5.1 surround sound speakers for sound sytem through my Integra 5.2 AVR. Using Sony 75"" LED Tv display- which has 4k upscale as well as dolby vision. The picture quality combined with the surround sound produced from this firestick is the best. Just fantastic. Had to figure out how to adjust the settings so the screen would not intermittently go black for a second or some short period of time. I found out it had to do with 4k ultra HD Display resolution under its settings turned on when vewing non 4k content. Once I realized to turn this off unless actually watching a 4k UHD content everything worked great, no more black outs on the screen. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is no dolby vision for viewing display of movie/shows that are produced in dolby vision content. Sometime in 2019 the firseticktv 4k came out with support for dolby vision, but still can not select it as a video resolution in display, you can select only ""Auto (up to 4k Ultra HD"") under Display in settings. If you do this, make sure you select ""Adaptive"" Not ""Always HDR"" under Display in Settings, otherwise when you select a 4k dolby viaion content, it will not switch over to dolby vision.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0

I tested my internet multiple times, resetting, factory reset, unplugging, disconnecting and connecting adapter and etc. The problem was if I couldn't update it I couldn't use it because it would just keep cutting out and nothing would load.

Say you have Showtime on your cable package, you cant use their remote to search showtime or you have to pay for it through amazon again.  So pretty much useless for what I wanted.  It does work fine though.  Nothing wrong with the technology, other than yet another spying on everything you watch.  Oh and it also freezes the TV often.

We were already paying for Netflix and found a few free tv and old movie apps and we are still on a free trial for sling tv.  The alexa voice makes searching for apps and doing some small tasks a ton easier.  Sometimes when we power it on with the TV the ""home"" is unavailable but have been still able to tell alexa to open Netflix or Sling with no issues so far.

With the new 4K stick the selections start immediately and there has not been any buffering. The best part tho? It works with my SONOS!!!!

I don't think it's the Fire TV Stick's fault, but rather CBS' app's fault. These Fire TV Sticks are super reasonable, and a must have for every TV regardless of what room it's in. Bathroom TV? Check.

"I really love this android stick. It is slim, it works well, and the only thing that stops me from giving it a 5/5 is the unfortunate fact that it has no system volume control (for the stick itself) as in, if you are using this on a computer monitor with built in audio extraction, you would not be able to control the volume levels through the remote.

This one is always forgetting our network and saying our network is out but on my other tv in another room with the old fire stick it works perfectly. I would return this if I could. Also, they are trying to blame our network for streaming  yet our internet is fast. I have only had problems with this fire stick.Update: Amazon reached out to me after my review and helped solve the issue up to this point. Their customer service was great. We had to factory reset the fire stick. Impressed with their customer service.",4,1,2019-9-18,1,1,0
"I had a Roku and this is better in every way! Now that you can get YouTube, what's not to love? It's faster,has more features, a better remote (rf), and more affordable. Most importantly, the picture is so vivid compared to the Roku. Hope this helps!",5,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
Purchased two of the Fire Sticks for older TVs. Installation took about 30 minutes including tweaking the wireless networks to get the best signal. Was able to get rid of all the cable boxes and controls. Performance and ease of use is great!,5,1,2019-10-15,1,1,0
"I upgraded because my old fire stick stopped working, this one doesn't do what it says or the directions are unclear. So far I should have just gotten the cheaper one. Because of the quarantines going on I can't really take it to the ups store to return it. I should have bought the cheaper one. Alexa doesn't work on this one and I don't know how to fix it. The cheaper one was user friendly. This one not so much .",1,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I had to buy this to replace my old Fire Stick, which was the only one that wouldn't access Apple+. The old one worked fairly well.  This one does NOT.  I have to reset it just about every day.  It keeps saying I have a network problem.  No, I don't.  NOTHING else that connects to my network has an issue.  This happened with one of their Fire tablets, too, so I had to get a new one.  I'm pretty sure this will be the last Amazon product I buy.  Lesson learned, finally.",2,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"In general, the product does what it is supposed to do. The interface is user friendly but is loaded with ads and other distracting graphics. I dislike the remote itself. I find it difficult to use due to its size, and good luck trying to change the batteries! I could not for the life of me get the remote battery cover open. This design flaw should be addressed, I am sure others have extreme difficulties getting this off.",4,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
I love the Fire TV stick and the free prime videos. Setup the easiest of any product that I have bought. My TV was recognized immediately. I have Frontier Fios and have excellent video quality. This beats my Dish which has occasional artifacts - about once every 20 mins I get an audio or video compression event (AKA floating heads or sound loss etc). The 1080p is beautiful and the suggestions of things I would like to watch is spot on. Packaging was comparable to Apple products. For the price of a DVD or a theater ticket it is possible to explore a whole new world.,5,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0
"I have tried to get to a section to possibly get a replacement for this 4K firestick. The Serial no. G070VM09846J0J4K.This is a Firestick 4K.  It no longer works properly.  It loses connection to the network when I go the DVR.  I have the Amazon DVR and an antenna in my attic.  I have 6 tvs hooked up.  4 with a LAN cable and 2 using WiFi.  This one is hard wired with ethernet LAN cable.  All the other firesticks are working (1 is an old version 1)  (2 are pendants).  It was ordered on Dec 10, 2018 and delivered on Dec 12, 2018.  It says replacement may be possible thru Dec 12, 2019.  I love this system.  I was able to cut my cable and am saving ~ $90/month.  I just need to replace this firestick.",2,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"I had to return the first day because it wouldn’t stay connected to WIFI long enough to set it up. After receiving my replacement, it was a little better but, I still drop WIFI constantly. I have put an extender cable on it and my router is within a few feet of the fire stick. Still have problems. My internet works perfectly with all other devices, regardless of how many devices are connected. The fire stick has problems even if ALL other devices are disconnected. It is nice when it works and would be great if this issue could be resolved but, it seems to be a long standing problem that they can’t seem to figure out.",3,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0
Been using for about 2 years and the only problem I have with it is that is will make you think there’s something wrong with your tv/speaker. Sometimes the picture will turn green/pixelated and the sound will be distorted if you leave it on for too long. All you do is restart it but it for sure game me a mini heart attack. Other than that it’s great picture quality and it streams fast.,5,1,2020-9-23,1,1,0
"I love being able to watch shows and movies on Fire TV with this, and the ease of the remote, and the voice control, is effortless. It’s a clear win for me over cable. The voice remote is great, and it becomes even better when you connect an Echo device to it. I now use my Echo to voice control shows on the Fire TV, as well as turn on the TV and living room lamp using smart sockets. This combination of Fire TV stick, Echo, and smart sockets is amazing, and makes relaxing even better than it used to be.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I have to reset the device EVERY time I turn on the TV and want to use it, and sometimes I have to do that twice. It usually takes me between 5-10 minutes to get it working and if I change what I am watching, I have to go through that again. I have followed the advice online including clearing caches, etc. Nothing helps. There doesn’t appear to be a way to get support from Amazon, and this problem must be common based on videos and questions posted online. Very frustrating.  I need another device for a different TV and will look at other options than Firestick. Unfortunately the Firestick 4K for me is a fail.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"Picked up on sale so thought it was worth a try for a couple programs that come in sketchy.  This solved it and just makes everything look better.  I would've picked this up sooner if I knew it was such an improvement.  Now that it still works fine after a couple weeks, bought another to replace another older stick.  Having one remote that connected so easy (no codes, no searching, no pairing, no nothing) is a major bonus.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
I upgraded from a old firestick to the 4k. It seems smoother than the old one and has both 2.4 and 5 for wifi. What I love about this one when watching a movie or show I can set it to play not only out of my soundbar but my two echo v2 as well for a home theater feel. What I really love is that I can speak into the remote to play Amazon music and have all echoes in the house (6) play as a group in addition to my soundbar on the tv with the new firestick! If there is lag on the echoes compared to the soundbar click on the adjust audio sync icon in the bottom right of the amazon music screen to fix. Best 25.00 value I ever got. Get it on sale.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"A great streaming device, way better they the apps on our TV. I got this because I wanted to watch YouTube TV and our TV didn't have it available, in fact, it had very few apps at all. it never updated the ones it had and come to find out was very slow.

I  can only speak to the streaming Quality. I have not used nor Mastered the built in Alexa features. I had 4 1st generation Firesticks and I gave up using them. The upgrade is a pleasant surprise and have exceeded my expectations. I will go out a limb to say it moves just as fast as Apple TV. That’s no exaggeration. I’m loving it and even watching cable through apps I already pay for through the fire stick.,5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"Purchased it mainly, so that I could voice everything. Just set up and getting used to it, and its ok, but when you search internet (won't let you make google your home page, only Bing and Firefix) you still have to use the remote to hit search button. I am going to look a little more into the settings, but I think that is the only way. Other than that, it was easy set up. Takes some time to download and log into all your apps. Don't want to download too many apps, and then find out I have to pay for them, or already have a subscription.",3,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"This thing is my go to for any and all entertainment. You can do pretty much anything. 4k streams from YouTube and all sorts of other apps. You can get a recast as I did and record in full HD on any standard air channels. Buy this, you won't find anything better. I put one on every tv and cancelled my cable.

Absolute piece of crap. Only positive thing I can say is they set up was very easy. I was so hoping this would be the solution to the battle with direct tv but this is worse. Doesn’t work 60%of the time. Freezes up (this is not an internet speed issue but a device problem). Everything you want to watch costs extra and by the time to subscribe to the basic things you want in your package your paying close to the same as you were for Direct TV. So incredibly disappointed.,2,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
Streaming quality and speed are both good.  Firestick doesn't stay locked on WiFi as well as one might like requiring re-entry of parameters.Big issue was the remote dying after 10-11 months of operations.  Use was on the living room TV so it gets used several hours every day.  Some web searching shows this to be a lot more typical than it should.  Suggestion is Amazon work to increase the robustness of the remote.,3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"Like the news--do not like subscriptions for everything.  I also do not like that I do not get local information and weather on the device.  It is all national.

"The reason we purchased this was that our early version of a smart Panasonic TV lost it's ability to access Apps needed to watch such things as Netflex , Hulu, etc. and by adding this to our existing TV we have access once again. Don't be misled, this is not totally free tv. You will need access to some Apps by subscribing for a fee and you will need internet access for the Apps to work. That being said there are a multitude of free Apps not requiring a subscription fee. and you will have access to Live TV.  It was extremely easy to set up and adjust to your liking. The Sound & Picture Quality are superb. It is definitely a smart choice at a great price.

I got this fire stick and thought it would stream as well as the LG software on my other TV. It is 4k but the HDR is not that great. I hate the 60 hertz frame rate on this. It took me a long time adjusting the settings on the TV and the fire stick. The picture looks fine as in sharpness and color but the video isn't smooth. It looks like it's skipping frame rates which is why I believe the 60hz is the problem.,3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

"This was the easiest set up I’ve ever experienced, only look a few minutes !  The hardest and longest time spent was typing in my ID and password!Downloaded the Apple TV app, it’s not too user friendly.  Doesn’t show what episode you are on to continue watching, once you stop and exit, that’s frustrating.  Sometimes it’s not easy accessing it or finding content. Not as easy as Netflix I don’t think.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

Just like the previous version of the FireStick but a bit faster. The new remote having volume and power controls are a game changer! I own 4 original fire sticks and plan on changing all of them to the newer 4K version,5,1,2018-11-9,1,3,0
"I bought it so I could watch Disney , but it does  so much more. I now use it for Prime, Netflix and so much more. It's fast and error free. It also paired with my Sony surround around system with no problem. We are really enjoying the Firestick and its ease of use.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0
"Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa Voice Remote (streaming media player) takes your TV or home theater system to the next level.  This next-gen portable device sets-up easily and is intuitive to use. On-screen instructions are provided along with a printed insert.

Only option then is to watch prime.  Unless I’m partially drunk that is never a great alternative!Also, the power button is extremely sensitive, like a woman or millennial, press once, wait 30 seconds.

When I first set this up, I had to call Amazon because the sound and image was not syncing up at all. I eventually figured it out and it’s much better, but sometimes it still acts up. I haven’t had an issue using it with Prime Video at all.",4,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
I loved this new Fire tv stick 4K until the last 30 days or so.  Purchased right after Christmas and has worked fine but now for some reason it cannot detect my WiFi network. I remove it and plug in my original Fire stick and no issues plus all other TVs and devices working fine. I’ve reset and restarted til I’m finished trying.  Very disappointed because it was great in the beginning.,2,1,2019-4-5,1,1,0
I had an original Fire TV Stick that was eligible for a half-price upgrade replacement.  I thought the old one worked OK but this latest version is well worth the dollars to upgrade.  Not only do the apps load much faster but the voice remote lets you go straight to Netflix or YouTube without pushing any buttons (except the microphone button) and you can do YouTube searches without having to tediously type in the key words.,5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
I used it to stream youtube TV onto an older TV. It worked very well and much faster than the Roku device I was using.  Roku paused the game for the last two innings of the world series with the little spinner in the middle of the screen.  I gave the Roku away.,5,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0

I wish Amazon and Britbox would come to some agreement where existing Britbox subscribers could use Britbox on the Fire streaming device.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
They finally did it right this time. I'm so happy with the stick I actually bought a second one. 1 year ago I switched to nvidia sheild because of the disappointment and dissatisfaction of the fire TV since it felt like they got cheap and no 9t care for they're customers.

Decided to get this because our 4K smart tv doesn’t seem to connect to our internet very well and it was buffering a lot on sling and Netflix.  The only issue we have with the new 4K stick is the sound to the tv not coming on all the time when we use the fire stick. Everything will be completely silent unless we turn the tv and stick off and on and switch inputs and go back a few times.  We haven’t had this issue with the non-4K stick and we’ve determined it’s not our tv since the sound plays fine on everything else in that port so that would be our only issue with it.  Otherwise it’s very user friendly and connects very well to our WiFi connection.,4,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0
"Although I had a Fire Stick for streaming versatility already, the purchase of a Recast (I am a cord cutter) required a Fire Stick for every TV that I wanted to connect wirelessly to the DVR. The setup is pretty easy, the quality is great, Alexa works well, and the addition of an on/off button on the remote that controls the TV, plus the volume up/down buttons, and the mute button all are a VAST improvement over previous Fire Sticks.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0
"This is pretty much like any other fire TV stick. The main difference is the volume control on the remote. It does allow 4k streaming, but only if your internet connection is fast enough, and the shows/movies you are watching are available in 4k. There are still too few options available in the 4k format without paying a premium for add-ons and special programming through whatever streaming service you use. We got a 4k TV, so it only made sense to upgradethe fire stick, right? Plus we got a rebate for returning our old fire stick, so the price came down to about what we paid for the original.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I got so tired of my satellite TV provider raising my rates I had to do something.  I checked into various options and the Amazon Fire TV Stick was the best and least expensive.  With a one-time charge for the device, I got more channels with more options than I ever got with satellite or cable.  Plus, with the Alexa Voice Recognition option, I could become so lazy, I didn't even have to press a button.  No searching for a particular movie or show, just tell Alexa what to play, she searches through every available channel and finds it then plays it for your enjoyment.  How could anything be easier?  Or cheaper?  I highly recommend Amazon's Fire TV Stick and get out from under the cable and satellite thumbs.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I've used Firestick for several years. Bought a new TV, wanted a new Firestick. There are some really neat updates like now controlling the Soundbar from the Firestick Remote, turning the TV on and off from the Firestick Remote, and although I have been unsuccessful in an attempt, supposedly the Firestick can be controlled from my Echo device. My lack of success the is the reason I only gave 4 stars for integration.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"The firestick was a huge game changer and was excited about how easy and simple it is to use and have access to all your streaming services. However, just last week the remote completely stopped working 13 months after original purchase. I've tried disconnecting and connecting, changing batteries, etc. and NOTHING works. This is extremely disappointing as Amazon only has a warranty for this product for only one year and wont even give me replacement options as those have also expired. If you only want this product to function for one year, then buy it! However, if your wanting something to last over 13 months- this product isn't for you as Amazon has made it extremely hard for me to feel like I can have any type of assistance or support.",1,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
4k version connects very well with wifi and functionality improved over HD version - leverages many 4k videos that are included with Amazon prime. Remote integration also very useful. I switched both my Roku Express devices for this and discovered Amazon have a trade in credit for those which made the deal even better. i have Alexa but haven't synched as the voice command on the firestick does all i need.,5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

Just buy the Nvidia Shield and get performance that will match your TV, network,and other needs.",1,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
Netflix won't always render in 4k for inexplicable reasons and Amazon doesn't want to acknowledge the issue. It may be fixed now - pretty sure its software not hardwarea lot more freedom with the fire stick than others that must approve add-ons (like bluetooth ear plugs) I use a monitor with no sound and simply not going to pay for a licensed audio. IT forces me with others to plug my speakers into the ear phone out,4,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
As stated by others the setup is quick and easy.  Streaming quality is excellent.  Haven't done too much exploring with all the possibilities on the fire tv stick. One of the main reasons I've added a couple is so I can use the Dish Anywhere app in remote locations around our property.  The Windows app for dish doesn't seem to work very well anymore but the Fire TV 4K stick works great with the Dish App.,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
I bought 2 Fire Sticks and a Fire Recast to replace my DirecTV. I’ve used it for a little over a week. Everything is working well. The interface is good. Little buffering. The voice commands work well on the remote. I haven’t used Alexa much with it. It would be nice if you could arrange your favorites in the channel guide. I did find that on Netflix that Atmosphere and HDR did not pass through as they do from my TV so I switch sources for that one. As a cord cutting solution this is the best that I have found.,5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0

For 10 extra bucks, go for the 4k.. even if you dont have the latest 4k tv, it's worth it. As far as streaming capabilities, I think side by side, wifi signal strength being equal, both perform as expected. I don't use the voice or Alexa much, but the 4k remote having volume control built in, is another plus. You dont have to grab the tv remote to adjust the volume.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0

I love the new Alexa upgrade with the fire stick I’m really loven how my movies look.

"Want to get rid of TV charges with your cable?  Choose FireStick - it has multiple services, that even when purchased separately, were still less than having cable TV.  It has many features that we LOVE.  Especially the IMDB where movies from the past are available - it's a huge database of movies.  Will probably purchase another for a different TV in a different room.  All you need is internet to be able to use it.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
So far we're liking the Firestick. It's a little tricky for us because we still use a regular computer in the other room to do our regular internet stuff so we have to run back and forth to verify all the channels we add. If you use a laptop or your phone you can sit in the same room and do it all. This is replacing one Cable TV box so that's a plus. I'll post more later after we've used it for a while.,5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

I am still in the process of chatting with tech support. I’ve had the fire stick for a week now. The picture is a bit foggy and dark. I feel as if I’m watching in an old 1990’s tv.

It’s worth the extra $20 but this whole experience has taken up way too much time,1,1,2018-12-11,1,1,0
Really enjoying the fire stick. Takes some getting used to navigating channels since it doesn't have numbers to punch in like a regular remote.  I'm using it due to having fiber optic television viewing. It's clear as a bell coming thru the fire stick.

"I really liked the interface and overall design of the fire stick way better than the Roku. That is until I found out the hard way that Buying movies didn’t require a pin. On any other device in my house if we want to watch something free we can, but if they try to buy/rent something I’m prompted for my pin code like i setup. But as I find out the hard way, on a fire stick that is disabled by default. So my kid was able to order a ton of movies without me knowing. I called amazon and was told I had to setup parental controls, but with those the only options are to not require a pin code for anything or to require it for everything(which is so annoying). It prompts for my pin to watch free stuff, as well as launching any app. Very poor implementation, when roku’s handle it as intended.",2,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0

It comes on much quicker and is a breeze to navigate.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Streaming quality is excellent. Audio is good, but the level could be slightly higher. With the other two devices in my television I usually find a volume level of 12-14 is sufficient, with the Fire stick I need the volume set to 18-24. Not really a big deal. My only disappointment is the lack of voice control with my Echo Dot. I guess I should have done a little more research, but even knowing this now I would buy this product again.",5,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"Our ROKU that we have had for a couple of years was no longer able to play content from Prime.  We were told that it was a WIFI problem and not a Roku problem and we would not be allowed to replace the Roku. Every thing checked out with the WIFI so we said screw the Roku and try the Firestick. It's pretty much the same as a Roku so there is no learning curve to be had. I don't use Alexa, so I have no opinion on that.",4,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I though the picture was supposed to be better, but I can not see any more difference than the non 4k system.  Even when playing a movie in 4k.  Kind of a wast of money, since I already had the original. The best thing about this one is the remote, I can now turn the volume up and turn off the TV with this one remote.  Other than that I would say don't wast your money if you already have a fire stick.",3,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
I replaced my Chromecast with this Fire Stick and found it to be much better than the Chromecast.  I like having the remote instead of using my cell phone to control it (the Chromecast does not have a remote).  The voice searching is also very convenient.,5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
"Bought this stick to replace a first generation stick we got 5-6 years back.  Definitely better: More memory, faster, handles more apps (e.g., YouTube TV wouldn't run on the old stick).  Having power, volume and mute buttons on the remote is nice, too.  The only problem we've had is trying to play Amazon Music library using Alexa.  I'm hoping to work that out, but so far it hasn't been quite seamless.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"Excellent for accessing ALL steaming media platforms. I use the Firestick 4K instead of the TV's built in apps. The Firestick is generally faster and has more memory then most built in apps. Plus if your TV is older many of the apps, like Netflix, are no longer supported on older TV's. I connect my Firestick 4K through the Ethernet adapter to avoid any lag. Firestick is also excellent to access other streaming services like Kodi. The 4K picture quality is amazing.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,1

"I have had the first and second generation of this product and I bought this one, the 4k specifically because the remote has a volume control as well as a power button.  Once you get this set up you have ONE remote for your Amazon Fire TV unit and can change volume and mute when needed.  No more need for 2 or 3 remotes.  Works well and synced up to my router easily once I put in all the security info.  It ""learned"" on its own to match the codes need for the TV volume control and power on/off.  I am very impressed.  Really LOVE this product.",5,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0
"Let me begin by saying we were somewhat forced to purchase this as our SMART TV was no longer supported by AMAZON so couldn't view PRIME video that we paid for.  Not very happy with Amazon for that reason.. of course we are not forced to pay for PRIME so it is our choice.. Having said that this was fairly easy to install and use.  The only thing I don't like is that there is no clear ""Off""... you can put it to sleep but that is kind of hard to find.  I just don't like the idea that Alexa may be listening all the time.  Haven't used the voice feature that much.  It was cheaper than buying a new tv..  but it's pretty frustrating that electronics companies can market a product promising something and then later say, Oh sorry we aren't supporting that anymore"".  they should have to pay for the recycling or disposal of all those unusable items now.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I hesitated buying this item, for a while, but after purchasing it and using it for a few days I could kick myself for not getting it sooner,  the first thing I noticed was the better resolution on pretty much everything.  Then it loads everything faster.  You will not regret buying it.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
"Prefect for Amazon Prime users. I bought this product primarily to get access to the DC app that is currently not available on smart TV or the PS4 to stream on my TV. The addition bonus that it syncs to your Amazon prime account and cable was an added plus. Their are so many app all conveniently on one device. The only thing I am disappointed about is that it went on sale right after buying it at normal price. Otherwise, I haven’t had any issues and it’s been  hands down a great product.",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
I have 2 older FireSticks and decided to purchase a new one (half price).  I'm glad I did as it was super fast to set up and the speed is better.  I plan on purchasing additional ones soon.

"I got this 4K Firestick to replace my old one, which was still working fine, by the way. I wanted the voice control and the 4K feature, because I plan to buy a 4K TV in the new year. I love how smoothly it works with no buffering or any other problems. It is easy to add my favorite apps, as well. Even on my TV, which isn't a 4K, the picture quality is a lot better.

My first language is Spanish and I have an accent, voice recognition almost never works for me, Alexa is the first one to do exactly as I say.

I have never been big on streaming however recently I have added a fire TV stick and a fire TV cube in different rooms. I love them both. The amount of content at your fingertips is simply amazing. A lot of the content is free and some of the other stuff costs a little.

"So far we love the Firestick.  We don't use the voice control so couldn't say if we like it or not.  Very easy to use and the stream quality is very good.  Only complaint was when we received it and tried (and tried, and tried) to put the batteries in the remote.  The remote's battery chamber is very difficult to use, and finally we had to use a very small screw driver to gently pry it open.  Dreading when we have to replace the batteries.....",5,1,2019-5-3,1,0,0
So far I am a definite fan of the Fire Stick. It is super easy to set up and use and I love the voice recognition feature. My only criticism is that the voice recognition can sometimes be a little faulty and I sometimes have to restart the Fire Stick to get some apps to work properly but both of those issue are minor and are quick fixes. I am very satisfied with this product and would happily recommend it to others.,4,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"I would like to give this a five star rating because I like the concept and my other fire stick works fine but this one is flawed or something.

If it’s operator error, please let me know. Thanks",2,1,2019-5-6,1,1,0
"I installed my fire stick, picked the language and entered a few passwords and now I have access to a great number of streaming shows and movies as well as some premium channels through my Amazon account.

"We have two older Fire Sticks/Fire TVs, and this is definitely the best version by far. It seems the same to me in every way except for the remote.

Attached to a Vizio TVQuirky to set up streaming was problematic. Actually quit during the SuperBowl - which is why I bought it in the first place. When I turn on the tv with the fire remote it just sits there with a blank screen until I cycle through the inputs. Never had (and still don’t have) an issue with Roku.

Amazon saw my review and called me to see if they could troubleshoot why it wasn't working and we got it working again!! It just stopped connecting to the TV. I never would have thought of that or probably tried to call them myself, so I'm so happy they called! Made my star turn into a 5! :)",2,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"We use our Fire Stick as our primary streaming device.  Picture quality is great.  The menu is intuitive.  It’s easy to add or remove channels.  Voice recognition works the way it should.  We also like the versatility Fire Stick offers for traveling.  This is the only steaming device that allows you to enter network sign on information at hotels and resorts.  When you select the network hotels then ask for a code or a room number and name.  When this pops up on the Fire Stick you can enter that info and get on to the network.  We can’t do that with AppleTV, Roku or Chromecast.  And...it works in Europe and the US Virgin Islands.  Highly recommended.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
we purchased this new stick in order to get Disney Plus and frankly it sucks.  I used the same wifi signal for my other devices and none of them have the problem this one does....it is constantly buffering to the point what you are watching is ruined.

Bought and set up my 4k fire tv stick today. I must say Amazon you have really made it super simple to set up this device.  In just a few clicks after  initial power on i was done. I also would like to add that no longer needing the tv remote for power on/off  and for volume is  incredibly nice. I think that it makes my non 4K tv look much better too. The menu’s are  very fast a fluid when surfing through them.,5,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0

On the first few days of using it it stuck on the first screen- red fire TV letters and white screen and does NOTHING else! Worked for wopping 3 days!  I am glad I didn't get rid of older version, that began to freeze on unlimited prime music. I thought  the older fire stick might not able to handle the ammount of information with upgraded subscription, or something of that nature. But ""upgraded"" version is WAY worse!

"So all of these fire products are very similar. Just repackaged and sold like they were SOA. Instead of addressing the real issues like adding gigabit ether input. The processor speed and storage are not improved here. This product does have one new feature, the volume control on the remote. It sinks up with most smart TVs and provides a way to not only control content but also volume on your TV or Receiver. This is a nice feature in that it subtracts the need to keep the TV remote handy.",5,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0

"I recently got this firestick instead of a new Roku, basically because the Roku one I wanted was sold out and this was similar.  I do like the interface of this one and the voice capabilities.  I appreciate that the remote control volume works with our receiver because many things do not.  The downside that I have noticed is that sometimes it is hard to find channels that you have downloaded and it seems to populate the initial channels section with channels that it automatically downloaded that I don't want.  We have had a couple issues with streaming quality, but that was on a specific show and they have not been repeated, so I believe that was an issue from the recording, not the streaming stick.  I will say that it seems to do as well as my DVD player (which has a hardwired internet connection) for 4k streaming.  Overall a good solution.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
It’s a great product and it’s very user friendly .Setup was a breeze and once you jailbreak it you have access to tons and tons of apps. This 4K stick goes a long way in helping you cut the cord from cable. It will also airplay with lots of apps if you have an iPhone. It’s a home run for sure.

In any case, I worked it out and am happy with the performance of the Fire device.",4,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
I was not sure what to expect with the Amazon 4K streaming Stick but I was willing to try it for the holiday sale price. Upon the arrival I was impressed with quality setup was a breeze video quality after setting up with your video subscriptions providers I was impressed with the streaming quality. The Alexa voice interaction experience was not all that great don't expect it to be like the interaction with like  Alexa dot or other devices.Other than that I can recommend it as a smart remote for streaming don't expect it to be a substitute for your echoes devices.,4,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"Likes: Responsiveness of the controller and overall navigation between apps.Dislikes: While I know that in certain instances, access to content is governed by the subscription I have thru Spectrum.  However, advertised apps specifically ""for Fire TV"" should not be governed by that restriction.  The only restriction should be the internet feed to support streaming.  Also, when I tried to download and install the Spectrum app to use for subscribed services, it never would install properly.  Therefore, I had to use a PC connected to the TV to get my Spectrum content.",3,1,2019-8-31,1,1,0
Had one prior to this and lost the remote. Was extremely unfortunate since I was unable to use again without a remote allegedly (tried using Fire TV app multiple times) but needed remote to connect to Wifi to do so. Was like $20 for a new Firestick remote so I just decided to get a new streaming device all together. Aside from that I love this device so much and the quality of it is amazing! Missing some streaming apps I would love for them to have but we can’t win them all! I do prefer Roku over this however. This device is good as well!,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"It gives soooo much.  Yes - most of the FREE stuff that comes with Fire TV stick is old but for someone who does not have to keep up with the movie that released last weekend; you can get a lot of mileage out of it.  From movies, games and music, in the world of nickel and dimming you with subscription, this is the best value  Put it with the FREE TV antenna for local stations (ABC< CBS, NBC, PBS, etc) and you will be able to save $$ and still  get enough TV in the house.",5,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0
It worked fine. I am a sports nut and got amazon fire to be able to access services like HULU ect due to Direct TV raising my bill to an amount I was not going to pay. Finally Direct TV came around and I stuck with them. In all honesty the stick works well but adds no additional sports channels unless you subscribe and pay for an extra streaming service. Because of that I personally rarely use it.,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"The Firestick has been a game-changer in my living room. We've been reliant on the Xbox and Chromecast to watch shows on the living room tv, and we were unable to view certain things. The CW app streaming through the CC was horrible. Bad quality, lagging, it made us want to quit our CW shows entirely. I couldn't stream apple tv to my LR tv and had to watch on my iPad. And for some reason, I've had trouble streaming FandangoNow through the CC and can't access it on the Xbox anymore. The Firestick has changed all of that. CW streams like a dream, and I can watch apple tv and FandangoNow on the large screen. I'm kicking myself for waiting so long.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0

Plays 4K x265 files direct without any issue usually unless the files have non-standard subtitles. Wireless 5ghz is faster than ethernet if close enough to a router/AP so keep that in mind before looking at the ethernet adapter, which is only 100mbps and not 1gbps.My only complaint is with the new voice remote and the back battery cover, which wears down too easy and then slides around.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0

Love how easy this was to set up and use. Simple instructions and a great remote control. I really appreciate the volume control as previous versions did not have this. Easily connected to my Netflix account and had suggestions for many local station apps as well. Quick almost plug and play make this easy to set up and use within a couple of minutes.Only downside is it did fail to load the app screen one time and I had to look up how to restart the device as it wasn’t intuitive to find.

It was a good price so I decided to try it to replace my Roku. I referred that decision. I'll be succinct. If I stream something it starts off pixelated sometimes. It's random. Also randomly it will just not start a stream like it is unable to connect. It isn't an internet connection issue. All other devices work fine. In fact I could unplug my fire stick and plug in my Roku and have no problem. Essentially if I reboot it generally diced the problem but I have to do it a couple of times a day. It seems like there is a bigger memory issue. My older Roku doesn't have these issues. I'm going back to the Roku. I'm just glad I only spent $25 for it on sale.,1,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"Some qualifiers:  Prior to this purchase, I did not have a 4K receiver on my 4K TV, I had to purchase the ethernet connector but that is because our wifi can be a little wonky.Relatively easy setup.  Great picture on services offering 4K.  My only reason for not giving a full, 5-star rating is that the included remote will not pair with my JVC television.  It controls my Samsung soundbar just fine.  Haven't tried out the Alexa enabled features but that is because the nearest Alexa device is in the next room.",4,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
I like that its a stick that you can easily bring it anywhere when you travel can view 4k with such small device is amazing.

But I'm a digital dunce; so if I could master it after it after 15 minutes, absolutely anyone can! Delivers a great sharp picture, too. Only disappointment, and it's a biggie, is that the package of viewing options that come with the Firestick are pretty limited. Didn't know I'd have to sign up just to watch PBS, which I did. Didn't know I'd have to PAY to watch one of the Big Three networks, and so I didn't. All in all, though, Firestick is worth the price.",4,1,2019-2-5,1,0,0

Great improvement for streaming.  Reduced the overall rating to only four as the manufacturer was a bit stingy in the buttons being flush with the remote.

During regular programming, the screen randomly freezes and a green circle appears and just rotates, as if it's trying to refresh, causing me to restart the Stick.  On the YouTube TV app, the voice track can get way off track.  Restart the Stick.  That's pretty annoying and tiresome.  I've noticed this seems to be worse if the TV has been on for an extended period of time.  Since I'm currently working from home, sometimes the TV is on all day.  The Stick, apparently, doesn't like that at all.  Someone suggested to me the Stick doesn't have enough power to run some of these apps but I don't know if there's any truth to that.

I would just advise making sure your soundbar or projector is compatible before buying if that is what you are going to use it for. Other than that, it's a great tool, and better than my ""Smart TV"".",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"It is very easy to install. I bought this to watch FOX NATION on my tv instead of a small screen. The key board is not a standard key board. Makes typing a painful experience. Using the SILK browser was unwatchable. It spent more time loading content than playing it. The FIREFOX browser is better , but it still spends a lot of time buffering. To check my wireless speed I switched over to PRIME VIDEO on just my smart tv amd their was no buffering at all. I am very disappointed with the FIRE STICK.",2,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"This devise has given me so many headaches. I’ve owned 3 and they have all given me countless issues, the signal drops every 2 minutes like hopscotch, I sometimes have to restart the device between 10 and 20 times just to get it to stream HALF an episode on Netflix because it is the only app that will somewhat work, Amazon continuously has me troubleshoot my internet despite ALL of my other devices working including my workstation with pretty heavy programs, all my other streaming devises and laptops respond perfectly well to my internet connection, this is the only devise that gives me so much grief.

"The new remote that they have with the volume and power button is nice compared to the original remotes. However, I am unsure why it has a home button still bc it's useless, or maybe there is an issue with ours, idk which. You literally have to press the back button to get to where you want on the screen instead of just pressing home 1x and going where you want from there. Some apps don't exit with the back button, so I get stuck in apps a lot and have to restart the Firestick. It's pretty annoying. Many of the apps that use to work on our original Firestick, now automatically close out too mid-stream and you have to start the app up again and find what you were watching. Color clarity and definition are much better though, obviously, since it's 4k.",2,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
Pays a little extra because the average fire stick is just okay this is fantastic. You really don't need cable with this just Wi-Fi.With Pluto Tubi Xeno you can get all the free stations you want. Netflix has some good series that should keep you busy for a long time.,5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0

It really isn't an issue - now I hit 'Home' on the remote (to stop streaming), before I hit off button to turn off TV.

"After Dish raised their rates again we decided to dump them and get the Firestick 4K.  We ultimately bought three Firesticks.  They are easy to set up.  The remote even comes with batteries.  The power cord goes into the side of the Firestick, then into the power supply. The Firestick goes in the port on back of the TV.  The Firestick and remote automatically pair.  A screen comes on with your preferred language.  I missed ""English"" the first time and had to wait for it to cycle back to English. You also have to enter your email address and WIFI Password to connect. Then you see the TV providers: Netflix, Disney, YouTubeTV, Fubo, etc.  Most have a free trial period, then a monthly fee. That's it.  Just watch TV.  The only problem I can think of is ""What happens when you lose your WIFI?""  For me that would only happen if we lost power to the whole house.  It hasn't happened yet so I don't know but my bet is recovery is quick.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

On top of having every streaming service you can think of, the voice recognition is perfect. I have not used the alexa integration much, mainly due to the fact that I have an echo dot 2nd gen in my room only a few feet away from my TV. It also browses the web quite smoothly, which allows you to watch your favorite shows or movies on internet sites flawlessly. The remote is nice in the hand. In another room in the house we have the firestick 1st gen, and it will be hard going back to using that. On top of that, it is not very expensive at all, and easy to set up. My only complaint, which is why it only has 4/5 stars, is that my memorex tv is too old to be recognized by the firestick, which means I cant control volume or turn my tv on and off with the remote.

While the jury is still out, we have noticed a few signal interruptions on the Firestick, that could be attributed to it being run via WiFi and Roku is over Ethernet.  They are very comparable devices and the Firestick is less expensive.  But in my case I had an old Roku setup with our Logitech Harmony for home theater and swaping out was pretty easy for that room.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

I am having trouble with it streaming without buffering constantly! I’ve had my cable service out here twice and we have replaced and checked everything on their end and it is not on there and so it must be the stick.

"Audio out of synch with video. If there's a software update that fixes this for me, I'll gladly change this review to five stars. Before audio lost its synchronization with video, I loved the Fire TV Stick. If I don't get anywhere with all the so-called fixes I find online (from third parties, not Amazon itself, because there's been nothing productive from company with its name on the product), I'll have to go back to using a laptop to watch shows.",1,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
Works great on my projector.  I also have one on my bedroom TV.  Works better than the Google Chromecast for us.  The only thing I don’t like is the battery cover on the remote is very difficult to remove.  It feels like the remote is going to break while trying to open the cover.  I bought some third party silicone sleeves for the remotes and I really like having those on there to protect the remotes from damage from falling on my hardwood floors.,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

I love FireStick! I ordered 2. One for my mom and one for my aunt for Christmas. My mom loves it so much she is canceling cable. I’ve already cancelled cable.The only issue I had is when I ordered the 2 FireStick’s they were $24.99 each. The next day the price went down to $19.99. I emailed Amazon and was told I could not be refunded. Now I could’ve cancelled my order and reordered them but I get nervous around Christmas and wanted to make sure I’d have them on time. Otherwise everything was great including timely delivery and notifications,5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,1
I don't even know where to begin I got really excited when I got the stick and well you know I did find that the Amazon Market was quite restrictive everything cost too much even a stupid little app all the little apps cost money because the apps are very limited in the Amazon store that's the only choice you have and well I guess I'm too smart for my own good I figured out how to sideload it and put on my own apps and then Amazon decided to totally Nerf my stick so yeah I'm not happy at all I'll never get one over again I won't ever recommend one and Amazon I don't even know if I wanted to recommend you guys name or you guys are just too invasive in what people do with their own stuff.,1,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
Awesome product BUT if you don’t have unlimited data it will burn through a tb of date fast. Streams at like 6g an hour so do yourself a favor and get the normal one or change the data quality to lower or you will owe your provider at end of month. So if you lower it there’s no point in getting a 4K one.,3,1,2019-8-26,1,2,0

I just love how easily any devices can be connected to the TV with no complications as long as you have both the apps on your personal/any devices and downloaded on the Fire TV. I love how Alexa is also installed/came with it, there’s a button for that also, so it’s pretty convenient. The parental control/pin is quite useful when it’s set, especially when there are kids. The only downfall for me is that I wish it could’ve came with an extra stick.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,1,0

"Ordered 2 ,1 worked 1 would not . tried all the suggested fixes before calling support. Well if you can not give them a number that is supposed to be on the box so they can tell if you actually have the stick you ordered there is no recourse. I was supposed to go to settings and tell them the serial number. well if the device wont update the remote there is no way to go to settings. Customer service person was very hard to understand her accent made it very difficult, no help she had to put me on hold when ask any question so she could ask someone else what to do. I ask why not just send me another one and I would send back the one that does not work, NO was answer from whoever she had to go to, Beware if you order any of these if they do not work looks like Amazon`s answer is to throw it away,your not getting a replacement. would give less then 1 star but not possible.",1,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0

When setting up the device on your tv note that you will probably have to reset the router. When I was chatting with tech support for Amazon online the technician said to reset the router. Of course I knew that if I did that I would loose internet connection and therefore the chat would be lost also. Upon resetting the router and waiting a couple of minutes the Fire stick was finally ready for setup. I recommend that Amazon add that step to the setup instructions as it may save a lot of time and frustration. I haven't tried the voice functionality or the Alexa functionality.,4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I like it better than The Roku, it is super convenient offering several great apps that you can watch tv shows or movies free with commercials. No big deal really. The voice activation button makes it super convenient to search or ask for anything really. I like that the voice is only activated when you use the button and turns voice off when you let go. Easily move it room to room, or even take it on the go. Customer service saved this sale. They reached out quickly put things in Order.",5,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0
I was actually surprised how much better and responsive this fire stick is! The older fire stick where just so slow and the main reason why I never bought them. But this new fire stick 4K is a big improvement and love the volume and Power button feature which works with my Sony Bravia TV!* Watching prime shows with 4K UHD will play dark!

"I bought the fire stick for my new tv, not realizing that a Smart TV doesn’t require the fire stick in order to access Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, etc., so I transferred the fire stick to an old tv in the basement that my 7 year-old son and friends mostly use. It has been wonderful. That tv does not have a cable box, so the boys solely use the fire stick offerings and have a lot of fun with it. They love watching silly You Tube videos on a tv screen. It has been a small learning curve as I continue to figure it out, but I’m not the savviest tech person. Set up is extremely easy: plug it into the HDMI port on the tv, follow some onscreen prompts, and voila! Just make sure you remember all your various passwords. I’m sure it has features that I haven’t even explored, but it’s been great for our purposes. Given the general trend towards streaming tv over cable tv, the fire stick is a great option. I would def recommend it.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Impossible to open the remote! Have searched the internet, read articles, looked at videos, and we still are unable to open the remote! Cannot USE the Firestick, until we can open remote, and insert batteries. This is a crazy design flaw, in what we read is a fantastic product (Amazon Firestick). This low-star rating is for this version of the product which packages this impossible to open remote.UPDATE EDIT, 7/6/2020--FINALLY was able to open the remote, with EXTREME  effort and perserverance. Cannot imagine anyone with arthritis, handicapped, weaker due to younger or older age or illness being successful in opening it. Maybe ALL the remotes are not as tough as OURS, yet this is a design flaw that should not exist in any of them. --Now, the actual PRODUCT, the Amazon Firestick, is a joy so far, and not too difficult to figure out. Still just BEGINNING to use it--if it holds up, and aside from the design-flaw remote, for what it can do, we would give IT 5 Stars!",1,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0

I was running out of options for streaming content on my TV that otherwise works perfectly fine.  So I tried the Amazon Firestick and it works great.  It was easy to set up, with one minor holdup.  The battery compartment door sealed onto the remote so tightly that I physically could not slide it off.  I had to get a box cutter knife and force the knife into the tiny groove in order to get it to finally release open.

The microphone on the TV remote allows you to ask Alexia to find a specific TV show or Movie...very easy and intuitive to use.  Amazon sent promo cards for various TV series that are available by easily signing up for them on your computer...now I have approximately 100+ shows, in addition to Prime Movies.

Decided to try it and OMG, like a miracle, I am not exagerating, the streaming became stress free.

"I guess I should upgrade a bit more frequently.  I had the original model and it was getting so slow and would not stream very well.  I thought it was my internet connection but testing showed it was just fine.  I bought this version because it was inexpensive and I wanted to see if it would solve my slowness problems.  It did!  Like amazingly well.  I should have upgraded long ago.  The difference is night and day.  I can click on an app and it loads immediately instead of waiting half to a full minute.  The picture is so much clearer for live sports!  And apps do not suddenly stop working for no reason.  It is so much better.  If you have an old version, upgrade today and be amazed.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0

"There is really only one app that my husband was interested in and only two or three that I myself have had time to look at so far.  The sad truth of it is that the one channel that he has any real interest in does not work.  It skips and stutters through every program he pulls up and is more of a frustration and hassle than not having any TV to watch which is what we did for a long time.  It is very disappointing that once again we have been duped by a product that was supposed to be an answer to almost 2 years of being unable to get reasonable service.  And I accidentally ordered the wrong one as I got the Firestick with Alexa which has been a bigger problem.  I am sure that many people think it makes things easier and overlook, or don't even know, the fact that this thing is taking pictures and recording everything going on in our home.

The thing will not work unless you crawl behind the TV EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO USE IT, unplug it, wait, plug it back in and hope it works.

"I have owned each generation of fire sticks/TV and this is the absolute worst. The connection is horrible, maximum streaming bit rate barely is sufficient for 1080p, and their software is getting worse each year. It may be ok for streaming Netflix or Prime video, but it is deserving of the $21 price I paid as it is of poor quality. If you have a high quality time, spend the money for a premium device.",1,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

Everything (Comcast, Netflix) comes through the WiFi signal, which is very strong. At no other time does the the TV behave like this.  Only when coming through the Fire Stick. Had a free replacement sent by Amazon and second one was worse then the original for freezing up or just crashing.  Not worth even the cheap price for the frustration of trying to watch anything without multiple restarts.",1,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0

Ordered 3 for 3 separate TV's and the work great and were easy to setup.  I love the versatility of them to stream from all the services I want.  It has replaced my Apple TV which was apparently out dated and I couldn't get Disney + on it and I didn't want to spend another $200 on a new Apple TV that would be out of date in a year.  The fire stick allows for apples streaming service which lets me watch my iTunes library of movies.  I loved the Apple TV but having to buy one every couple of years for a few hundred bucks it wasn't worth it.  I have been happier with the firestick.  It's also easy to control and pauses when we make an announcement on our echos so the kids are forced to listen.  Love it.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

I am still learning, but between a bunch of downloads, then realizing I can't watch them because they are a pay service, or, watching what I want, but having to sign in through my cable provider first to be able to watch it, confuses me. I want to get rid of cable, but does that mean I won't be able to watch what I want being I will no longer have my cable service provider?

Combine that cost with the cost of Amazon Prime, and that was about the cost for 1 month of cable TV. We were in Puerto Rico for 8 months and never ran out of things to watch. With the newer version, it's so much easier to find something to watch with the Alexa Voice Remote. I recently purchased two of these for the two 4K TVs that we have.

Hope this helps someone else. I purchased and received two Fire TV Stick 4K and a Fire TV Recast in Dec 2018. After setup discovered I was not able to watch the CBS channel in Las Vegas. After rechecking and redoing setup the problem was still there. I noticed I was able to watch CBS on my iPad which was streaming from the Fire TV Recast and recorded CBS on the Recast even though I could not watch it and was able to watch the recorded show on my iPad. This leaves no doubt the Recast is receiving the CBS signal from the antenna. There seemed to be a problem with the Fire Stick 4K and to determine if this is true I went to Best Buy and purchased a new Fire TV Stick (not the 4K version) and after setup and software update I am able to watch CBS on that new device but still cannot watch it on the two new 4K versions.

I did not use the extension cable but rather plugged it into the USB outlet on my TV. Perhaps if I'd done that it wouldn't have gotten hot. But apparently that is a thing with the older ones. I have this one plugged in my new TV with the extension isn't even warm! The streaming is excellent. Even though I have a smart TV it doesn't show all the episodes on some of my Amazon Prime channels so I use the firestick. I don't use the voice or the Alexa part of it. I prefer not to. I am a fan of the fire stick. I love all the options I have for watching TV.,5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I finally got a Fire Stick and: 1) I had to resort to the internet to figure out how to OPEN the remote to put in the batteries, which involved using rubber gloves to get traction to force the incredibly tight back off; and 2) despite trying the Amazon batteries AND new Duracell batteries, the remote will not power on. The internet again...and a known issue again.... Update: Amazon shipped a new remote (still needed gloves to open) that works and the operation is now successful. I'm sure I will enjoy it now that I'm past the installation.",3,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
My smart tv is suddenly not too smart anymore and I found I needed a firestick to still watch Amazon videos and Netflix.  It was super easy to install and works just like I was promised.  Great product.  I might buy another later for my bedroom tv.,5,1,2019-8-13,1,1,0
Serious connectivity issues with this device. Replaced my Gen 1 Apple TV with this device. Same TV. Same location.

"I’m a big Apple guy, but not having a couple of hundred bucks for an Apple TV 4K, I thought I’d try a Fire Stick; now, I’m a true believer: quick as can be, great picture, and with the right apps, I can take it anywhere. And for a fraction of what I would spent on an ATV. If I could change anything, I’d be to have them add more RAM—it comes with 5GB, but after the OS is loaded, you’ve got about 2GB to play with—and you can’t unload some of the Amazon apps even if you want to. But that’s a pretty small thing to worry over.For the money, this is a steal.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0

"Love this fire stick! My TV is supposedly a smart TV but is sometimes kind of stupid. As in, it crashes constantly when I try to go to Netflix or Prime. The fire stick fixes that issue.

I also downloaded the app for pbs passport - which I had paid for but could only watch on my phone.  There are endless apps to choose from .  Well it feels endless.

I searched for a number to contact a live person to discuss these issues with and found nothing. That's impressively bad customer service in my opinion. I shouldn't need to be a detective to find a customer service phone number. I own only one TV, and will not go out to buy another one to use a useless piece of equipment. I will stream Netflix from my Mac into a HDMI port on my 4K TV and let that be it. Over the internet I can find and stream basically everything I need, even local news on a large screen.

Haven't used voice recognition yet or Alexa integration yet but set-up was easy. I love that I don't need to use the remote control for the TV. Now I just have one remote.One thing I found after using it for a while is that sometimes the voice doesn't match with picture. Don't know why. That didn't happen with the older gen firestick. All I have to do is back out of the picture then go back to it and that usually matches things back up again.,5,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
Now that I have this the first thing that comes to mind is where have you been all my life.  Cable I would not have again.

I wish I had been on to this sooner. Using the apps on my TV works great for those supported but using the apps on my other devices for streaming was a pain. I really like how this integrates everything I'm watching and I don't have to be constantly choosing other ports to watch on my TV. Love the remote. It's the perfect size without 4 million buttons you have no clue what they do. Def worth it!,5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

Had to use the included adapter to hook up to the older 27 inch Samsung hospital TV, (probably had an older HDMI standard) but it worked like a dream! He was so thankful not to have all the commercials of broadcast TV and watched all the currently available Better Call Saul episodes and got really into a modern western Netflix exclusive called Longmire. We're home now and have canceled his satellite TV and have it hooked up and it controls a little older (2005ish) Samsung TV great!

Changed the batteries, tried again and again to connect it with any other stick and it just wouldn’t work. I think there may have been a lose connection and it just gave out.

I bought the exact one a couple days prior at my neighborhood Target and I loved it so much I decided to get a second one for my other tv. Long story short, I received this one the next day and it’s the same remote appearance but the quality I think is cheaper. For one, the buttons feel harder. The first one I got (at target), the buttons felt smooth. Very soft presses and it would react. This one, the buttons are much harder. I can literally hear the click. Also, the power adapter is different. The one from Target brought a cube saying 5W. This cubes does not say that and is slightly smaller.And yesss. Both I bought were 4K.

There is really nothing to install this Fire Stick it does it all by itself! We bought this to pair up with our new 75in Samsung HDTV and the results are stellar.

Then she attempted to trace the problem, a wasted 45 minutes.  Finally, she stated that I should return the item, and she would order a replacement.

For TV I use Directv Now. I've been using the Apple TV 4K before the Fire Stick and I have to say the Directv Now app works better on the Fire stick. What works better is the guide and navigating the DVR menu. This is my personal opinion. I purchased the Inteset IReTV USB IR Receiver and the AuviPal 2-in-1 Fire Bridge Cable since I already had an Inteset Remote. Now I can control the Fire stick and my TV with just one remote.

The menu is nice. It obviously has a lot of integration with Amazon content so prime members would benefit most from it. It starts up when the HDMI comes active.

We are very happy with the Firestick.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
The Firestick 4K works well. Amazon needs to fix the layout for purchased Movies and TV Series. They have all of my purchased videos in a single scrolling line. I have over a thousand shows and it is really difficult to find one out of the continually scrolling line. Even the TV Series are separate from other videos in that series. It makes it very difficult to enjoy the device. If you just watch Amazon Prime shows it is fine to use the Firestick.,4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I have been a long time holdout on streaming services due to video/audio quality, but am thrilled with my experience with the Fire Stick 4k so far! One draw back is vendors like Xfinity purposely make it difficult to view their content on 3rd party devices, but I can live with that since services like Hulu have live sports now. The other thing that needs improvement are the remote and app controls with the TV itself. I don't have a brand new 4k smart TV(I wouldn't need this product if I did) and I still need to use the native remote to control inputs/channel, though volume control works fine on both the Alexa and app remotes.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
Well I just received my new 4k firestick and I will say that the short time that it has been connected it does work much better than my previous model and is much quicker with responses.

With Hope's of one day upgrading to 4k.After many hours and lots of utube,  eventually disconnected. I could never get Netflix back.  Ultimately,  ended disconnecting and reconnecting old firestick.

Installation took less than 10 minutes, and after going through the set up, we had access to all of these services, plus several others.

Then few weeks later it started freezing up on us, either during show or when we were in menu. Only way to clear this when we were watching a show was to go through menu (which again isn't user friendly) to get to apps to shut it down then restart it. If on menu we had to power down the fire stick.Then the voice of shows would drop out, causing us to do same steps.

"Very impressed with the improvement in image quality and speed of signal processing. On the advice of my local ISP, I upgraded from the original Fire TV Stick. I realize there are a lot of variables at every step of the streaming chain of events and circumstances, and most of those are beyond Amazon's control, but whatever they ""fixed"" in the 4K version made a noticeable difference in performance.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Getting the Amazon Firestick made it very easy to cut the cord. I got my first one a few months before I planned to cancel cable. I found it very easy to set up and to use. Occasionally it will lock up and have to be restarted. It will also lose connection with the Internet, but that is the internet’s fault. It’s easy to set up new apps and feel like I have everything set up to watch the shows and movies that I want to watch.",4,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

"I love this and it’s perfect except that voice commands disconnect  the hdmi connection. My tv has 2 hdmi connections. One is connected to the fire tv stick and when the other hdmi cable is connected (to my raspberry pi or laptop) and I speak into the fire tv remote, it disconnects the fire tv stick from the tv.

Every good thing they say about it is all true and it's totally worth the price tag but I have a negative thing to say as well here - it doesn't recognize Indian accent well.

I bought this on the chance that it could out perform my Roku Ultra. The main issues I have with my Roku is twofold. 1) On my 65 inch Samsung 4K TV it doesn't properly control the volume. 2) Occasionally the Roku locks up and reboots itself. So far with my Fire Stick it's been solid with no issues. The volume works well and I haven't had any reboots. Alexa works well also although I don't use it often. A+,5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
The 1 star if for their crappy customer service.  It would not register on my account and chat kept passing me around to different agents for 2 hours.

I've had this Alexa Fire Stick 4k for a little over a month now.  I can't give a full scale opinion yet because I'm still learning how to navigate thru but for the most part its been as easy as 1-2-3-. I like the fact that I can go back and watch missed episodes of some of my fav tv shows. Each week we're discovering more and more free channels. This fire stick is very simple to use and the remote is simple too. So far I've decreased my monthly cable bill by almost half and we love the savings. I don't have any negative issues to address at this time because my new fire stick is enjoyable.,5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0

Bought 2 and it has been a game changer. We have a huge 4K ultra hd Samsung tv in our living room that we love. Got Disney+ as a Christmas gift for our son and it turns out that our smart tv was too old to stream it on.  Tried streaming it on our PS4 but that was awful so did some research and decided on the fire stick. Got it Black Friday at such a good price that we go two so we could have one in our bedroom!  Works great in both locations!,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

"We bought this stick as an upgrade from our older model. It does stream much easier. Love this quality and how it is SO EASY to navigate awound. So easy to install that a 2nd grader can follow along!🤗You just plug into HDMI and off you off. Wonderful wonderful product. Great idea for the ""bedroom TVs"" that you don't want to put a cable box on. That's exactly why we bought ours. Bleessed neighbors with the older model. Thanks Amazon! Worth every penny!⚘🤩",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

"This device is compact and powerful. I own various stream devices and with no doubt I can say the Firestick is the one that I use the most. In comparison with other Firesticks this is the fastest to load stream videos, specially if the internet in your area is not too fast. It would be ideal to be able to watch movies purchased in other services, but can’t have everything. When it comes to Alexa, it is handy when you are studying or working and know exactly what you want to hear or see. Overall is a great compact and powerful piece of equipment and I highly recommended to anyone looking for a low budget, high quality streaming device. BTW parental control settings are the best to regulate content for children.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0

After I installed the product it was very unclear which apps would be free to me and which apps I would end up having to pay for.  I had to research it on YouTube which I shouldn't have had to do in order to use the product it should have been more user-friendly.  The main screen also seemed very cluttered.  It also wasn't clear ahead of time that the fire stick would not work with my Xfinity channel lineup since I pay for cable TV and I have a TV box in another room.  Had I known it wasn't compatible with Xfinity I would have ordered a Roku device instead which is compatible.  Also Alexa is not very smart and she never understands even basic commands.  My Xfinity voice remote that I have for a different TV is much smarter and user-friendly.  I also don't like that the remote control does not light up so you can't see it at night time without turning the light on.  That's ridiculous.  I'm thinking of returning this.,1,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"EXCELLENT PRODUCT! If you are sitting on the fence allow me to save you the torment. I sat on the fence for over a year. YES, if you are an avid fan of not overpaying for cable, tjis is the product.

"I have replaced 1 previous generation Fire TV and Fire Stick with 2 new Fire TV Stick 4K. The performance in comparison is phenomenal. I run a 3rd party application that now doesn't crash all the time, and I'm thrilled.The nicest new features is that when I was setting up the remote control, it asked me to turn the TV on and off and volume up and down. It figured out my devices with minor direction and now controls the stick, the TV power and the sound bar volume. Great feature!",5,1,2019-5-31,1,0,0
Netflix deprecated their Wii integration so I found myself needing another streaming device.  This is good.  Alexa is pretty limited.  I wish it was fully voice activated because by the time I grab the remote to push the mic button I might as well just continue using the remote.  It would be better if features like volume control and other things were voice activated too.,4,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
"so it wasn't comp. with my old tv (panasonic 1080) (2012 or 13)..., bought new tv (long story there too)..., and I spend MOST of my time deleting stuff from the app dealie..... and every day amazon adds more - can't delete their apps because they're useless...., they take most of the  5 gig amount (less than 1 gig available at ANY given time.... first day only had 2 available out of 5 - amazon took the rest!)  things won't ""load"" and buffering forever, (and I am supposed to have great speed ha ha ha)..., it's VERY limited and if you don't like amazon stuff - you lose. big time. worthless piece of....",1,1,2019-9-21,1,0,0
"It hasn’t been wowing, but it works for my two year old nephew’s shows. I bought this for the living room TV and it’s been working fine so far. The only thing is that it freezes every once in a while and the buttons won’t respond sometimes so much so that we have to turn everything off, unplug the fire stick and reset. The freezing could be related to my internet, but when it happens, none of the other systems go down or even twitch (I have two Apple TV’s, a Google Chromecast and my brother in law is always playing video games on his computer).

Excellent for watching free movies (w/o commercials) in high resolution.  There are many tutorials on YouTube on how to set up your Fire TV stick. Look for promotional deals that let you buy one for less than $30.Update 24 May 2020,5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"Everything considered this is an affordable way to stream high quality content at great speeds.  Falling short: I was made to believe this device would enable me to turn on my tv via echo devices or the remote. It doesn’t. Secondly,  I was under the impression that the fire stick was able to download the Spectrum TV app.  The FAQ page says that it can. It cannot - unless you’re willing to download 3rd party content which voids the warranty.  Another criticism that you’ll see on forums and that I can confirm is that if you ask Alexa a question via the remote she’ll YELL back at you regardless of your current tv volume level.  Say that you tell Alexa “Alexa, play The Office on Netflix.”  You’ll hear “PLAYING THE OFFICE ON NETFLIX!!!”  It’s crazy that they haven’t patch it.",3,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"We already had the previous model installed on the main TV and the one in what we call the Dog Pound.

We ordered two and she couldn't be happier. She is getting to watch things, mostly British channels and shows, that she couldn't even with our cable. There you have it.

"The Fire TV Stick is amazing!  It took all the different streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, HBO, etc.) and put them in one manageable format. No more using game consoles or apps on a smart tv  It is now all in one place. The apps also sync so if you watch something on your computer, when you use the Fire Stick it picks up where you stopped watching. Amazing. My only critique is I wish I bought It sooner.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"We were super happy with our existing Fire Sticks and weren’t planning to upgrade...But then Amazon offered such a great deal for the new model on launch day, and we couldn’t pass it up! So glad we took the plunge! First of all we have a regular 4 year old HDTV (not 3D, nothing fancy). The new Fire Stick gives us a clearer more brilliant picture and better sound. If you have a 3D or newer generation HDTV, I imagine that your experience will be even more enhanced. The remote’s response time is twice as fast and it includes an integrated power switch and volume control. No more juggling two remotes!! To us, this alone makes it worth the upgrade. I can’t stress enough that it is TOTALLY worth the upgrade!",5,1,2018-11-27,1,0,0
This is a good streaming device. Works well with Alexa and the voice feature in the remote works well. Like the interface and how the programs are displayed. I wish the streaming was smoother and the picture more consistent. We use this as a backup device and use the browser app often.

Great upgraded form Gen 1 firestick. I hope that more features get added such as the ability to work properly with routines. Routines will work if you have them setup but if Alexa is supposed to say something in the routine you get an audible message stating that this is not supported however she will complete the routine.  Its kind of become a running joke in my house.,5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"I love this product. I use Alexa in my smart home and purchased several fire sticks to make streaming easier. I would buy it 100 more times!

In addition To My TCL Roku 60 inch Television I decided To purchase The Amazon 4K Firestick which I Purchased at a discounted Rate of $25.00. This Upgraded version of The Firestick is a Definite Improvement on The Previous Version but If I am being honest it is completely unnecessary for The TCL Roku given You have Roku with Access To so many more apps and The Exact same smart Features. However I would Absolutely recommend The 4K Firestick for any one of your additional Televisions.All in all This was a Purchase Worth The Price and a Hell of a Deal.,5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,1
"The product works fine. My primary complaint about it is this: the streaming speed, when compared against the Roku I use on my main TV, is noticeably slower.  The time it takes to start a stream, and the initial resolution, which can be blurry, is a bit irritating.  I have plenty of bandwidth speed, and my wireless router isn’t very far away. So the fault isn’t on my end. If you have no other devices to compare it to, then you’ll be more than happy with it.",3,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"So I bought 2 of these upgrading from the previous generation, an I most say the difference is easy to notice. Its alot faster and makes watching movies an shows alot easier. My only problem I've had with these is that the voice recognition when searching for stuff isn't that good. Sometimes I would have to try like 4 times before it understood what I was saying.. an just recently one of the remotes stopped working, which is really disappointing seeing that I haven't even had it for 1 year as yet..yes I can us the remote app on my phone. But it gets annoying when a show finishes an ur on a call or doing something on the phone or someone else has ur phone and u have to take it from them or tell the person to hold so u can start the next movie.. an if I want a new remote I have to pay half the price of the item?

"The fire stick travels with you, we bought one on a cross country camping trip while in South Dakota and other than using up my data limit on my jet pack too quickly it was great although we were able to sometimes use the campgrounds Wi-Fi and I had to adjust the picture resolution to keep it from stopping to buffer. I had to change the broadcast location when we moved to a new campground, this is so the times in the guide would match the area we were in. The fire stick gave us great TV and movie options in areas that had no cable or even broadcast TV signals. So far the only down sides at home are no manual to learn all the neat things the remote does and we have a TV in the kitchen connected to the cable box that mirrors what is on in the living room and is controlled by the cable remote, so far I have not been able to do the same thing with the fire stick.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,1

"I recently ""cut the cord"" and began using YouTube TV and other streaming services for our TV and movie content. Our house has a mix of new smart TVs, older TVs that use an Apple TV 4K or Xbox to run the YouTube TV app, and a cheap ""dumb"" TV on our patio that used to use a cable box. The Fire TV Stick 4K is a perfect solution for that TV. Installation was easy and the picture quality through YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video is outstanding. Because this TV is outdoors I didn't want to invest in a new smart TV or more expensive Apple TV device as I fully expect its life cycle to be much less than its indoor companions. The price on the Fire TV Stick 4K made this a no brainer. Great product and great deal!!",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0

A step up from the first Fire stick we had.  The only issue is that our sound bar seems to get on a different volume than the TV and we have to occasionally use the TV remote to put the TV back down to 0 volume so that the Fire Stick can control the ZVOX sound unit.  It's a glitch that may be a user error, so I didn't deduct a star.",5,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0

This is a decent streaming device and nothing more.  A marginal upgrade from the built in smart-tv functions. The voice remote is nice but leaves a lot to be desired. it is not very responsive and frequently doesn't work. The apple tv voice remote is much better than this one. The interface is pretty easy to use and really quick but has a lot of built in advertisements. I got it on sale for $40 which is the absolute most I would pay for this.

I have a Fire TV 4K for the front room and love it. I considered buying one of those other 4K devices for my bedroom ( very pricey).  After resolving an audio dropout issue with this one (audio settings) I’m very satisfied. I really like the addition of volume control and power button with this one.

"The new Fire TV Stick works quite a bit better than my old one, so I'm very pleased about that. The thing I'm not pleased about is that my last few packages from Amazon did not include any packing materials; items were just thrown into a box and sent. One recent item I ordered was a hard-cover book intended to be a gift for my wife. It was sent in a box about 10 times bigger than the book, so, of course, the book went through a bumpy trip on the way to mean, and some minor damage resulted.

Received the fire stick today. Alexa remote doesn't work. Contacted customer service to see if they could send a replacement. They were absolutely no help at all. All they said was I had to send it back for a refund. Didn't even want to give the refund at first wanted to give me a gift card. I purchased the fire stick during Amazon deal days. They told me I would now have to pay full price for a new one to be sent out. Ridiculous. The product is faulty why should I have to pay for a whole other one. Canceling my prime accnt now as well.

I wish the remote was bigger so it would slip so easy and could not all into some may small areas,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
Overall this is a good product. The 4k fire stick stream quality is very good. There are many reviews that talk about its performance already. My one gripe is due to the short adapter cord that is bundled with the fire stick. It is provided to use if your tv's hdmi connections don't allow the fire stick to plug in directly. The provided cord is too short. This causes the firestick to hang downward if your connections face the side like many tv's do. The weight of the fire stick caused my connection to wear out. Any cord plugged in where the fire stick has been hangs downward and eventually falls out. The same for the fire stick. So be warned. The weight of the fire stick will render the port it is connected to useless if left there long enough. The cord needs to be lengthened so the fire stick can be layed flat on something. Thus providing support and not wearing out the port it is connected to.,2,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
The 4k is THEE way to go!!! We dont have a 4k tv yet but it works soooo great that I forget its internet tv for free! No lag at all!! The remote is so easy to use! You can even play games on it!

A sillicone cover will help with with gripping and the color will make it spottable at first glance. But getting the Firestick 4k totally opened up our tv time! We got it at Best Buy on sale.

Overloaded with ads, it's too much, creates mass confusion showing recent apps, your apps, apps available for download. It becomes so over whelming that I just go back to my Apple TV cause there are zero ads, only apps, the interface is simple, not confusing, not overwhelming, it's sad really, Amazon has destroyed their interface.

It appears from the many videos I found online about this problem by others that the design very poor.,4,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0
"This was such a great purchase, my mom's tv is a Sony TV and unfortunately youtube was no longer working because of an  internal issue, this 4k Fire TV Stick is like theee best purchase I could have made for her!

"If you have a smart TV then obviously you do not need this gadget. On my 12+ year old Samsung 61"" DLP it allows us to get a slightly better WiFi signal for our Netflix and other streaming content. I bought the 4K model for future upgrade, but probably will have a smart TV at that point, as we do on our newer Sharp unit. The only problem is now I have to reprogram my Logitech remote to allow this to work with my stereo, as the system is complicated...",4,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
Super easy to setup and start watching.  I primarily use it for Netflix as my Samsung TV frequently doesn't connect.  Menu interface is easy on the eyes and I can find things using the voice feature with ease.,5,1,2019-11-5,1,1,0
"I'm very happy w/ the Firestick. Installation was intuitive; I don't even know where my TV remote is anymore and I don't care. I still get my local news through apps available from the app store. Looking forward to seeing how I can integrate Alexa into my everyday (I don't need things more complicated) so I haven't ventured into that functionality yet but for TV controls, it's very helpful.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"We purchased a Samsung Smart TV 4 years ago, and became increasingly unhappy with the limitations of the applications, Hulu loading badly, and the quality of the video player, so we decided to try a Fire Stick 4k.  Setting it up was easy as is using the remote.  All the odd glitches we were experiencing were due to the ""smart"" television.  Well worth the purchase of the Fire Stick!",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
I have a few of the regular fire sticks and wanted to try the 4k to see if there is a difference. It definitely streams a lot faster than the other ones. Everything loads right away. I also like that they added the volume and power on the remotes now. There is a difference but not so much that I will buy all new ones. I'll just wait for them to be on sale again to slowly replace the other ones.,5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
We purchased the fire stick to cut cable and it was the best decision ever.  We are able to watch our favorite show and movies all in 4K quality.  We’ve even picked up new shows we wouldn’t have seen with cable.  The music with amazon music is amazing.  And there are so many other apps to customize to your taste.  Streaming quality is great.  I recommend this product to anyone.,5,1,2019-11-3,1,1,0
LOVE my Firestick!! I didn’t realize all I was missing out on until buying this. My only regret is not getting one sooner! Amazon Prime makes watching TV & Movies so easy with this!! Excellent quality. Buying one for my parents & In-Laws for Christmas. Highly recommend.,5,1,2019-9-1,1,1,0
"This device works flawlessly. I bought it to extend the life of my smartv, as the tv seemed to always be losing WiFi connectivity. I’ve had this problem with every smartv after two years the smart functions aren’t getting software support from manufacturer, so they start to glitch.

"When I initially installed, it took several times for me to connect to our wifi. I called customer support and the only thing they said was to retry it until it works (...really?). After a couple of days trying I ended up exchanging it with a friend's fire stick and it ended up working for me and it worked for him. So I wonder if there were some technical bugs that were happening on my end.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I am absolutely loving it. I had purchased before, I think was the first generation and I just used it a couple of times because it had long buffer times and it kept freezing on me. I decided to give it a try again to give my Xbox one a breather. If it wasn’t playing games, I was streaming apps. I definitely have Been working this product hard and is holding up. I don’t have a 4K tv so I can not say anything about that but it’s fast and yes you can use without a 4K tv. Before purchasing, I had the most difficult time getting a yes or no answer to that question. It still gives a great picture.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
I ended up purchasing 4 of the 4K Fire TV stick and now only use 2 of them.  I had several issues with buffering and low resolution pictures.  It was not my wifi as I had the ethernet adapter attached and I have 1GB service.  I switched over to the Roku ultra and my problems went away.  I do not recommend this device for your main streaming tvs.  I kept two on the back tvs where they don't get used a lot.,3,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"This would have been 5 stars except it did not do what I needed it to do, which shouldn’t be a problem for users with unlimited bandwidth. As a rural resident getting internet via satellite, I bought the Fire Stick because it was advertised as having the option of setting it at low resolution to conserve my metered bandwidth. So, yes you do have the option of restricting bandwidth, but the lowest setting of 720dpi is still way too much. At halfway through the month, with very modest streaming, I had used 70% of my allotment. So this isn’t working for me.",3,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"We had a old Fire Stick that worked great for a long time, and eventually stopped working with Netflix which often would buffer and buffer and buffer, and sometimes fail to stream a program altogether.

Tried Google and Apple Tv also.  Like the casting ability of Chrome but controlling it from a cell phone is slow and cumbersome as well as buggy on some apps.  Apple TV is solid but expensive and Apple wants to control everything.  Like the firestick with Alexa.  Couldn't find an app so I just asked Alexa and there it was.  Remote worked with my tv as well.  Going to purchase for all my TVs.  4K version works on my 1080P TVs and only costs just a little more in case I upgrade later.,5,1,2019-8-6,1,1,0
"The fire stick works fine, I haven't had any problems with any downloads or streaming. However some of the high definition streaming may buffer more frequently then others. I have not used the voice recognition or Alexa integration so I cannot comment on how well that works. Overall it was easy to set up and it is easy to use so for now I will give it five stars.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I have been a Google guy all along but this stick really surprised me.  It integrated with my TV and separate sound receiver with ease. It communicates flawlessly with my ring camera where I can seem my front door on my large screen TV. The Apps have a good response to the actions on the remote, better than my smart TV Apps.  I have also been impressed with Alexa thus far.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Had 2 non 4 K Fire TV Stick’s before this one so I’m familiar with the software, but this new version seems faster.I even prefer it to my Fire TV! Mostly because the Fire TV takes a while to boot when you switch to that output. Not a big deal but noticeable.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"The 4K Firestick is the greatest entertainment invention of our time.  I use a couple of the pre-loaded apps, but I'm a big ""3rd Party"" customer for movies and sports.  Streaming is high quality, mostly at 720 and 1080p but some 4K video.  It is most definitely dependent on Internet speed.  I run 200+ Mbps and have no issues with buffering.  The Firestick is limited on storage space, so either keep the cache clean or get an OTG cable and connect a 64 or 128 GB flash drive to store some apps (if they allow).  My family and I love this technology.  I give it 6 Stars.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
The description said it was ready to go and already registered - it wasn't. It failed to start until I was finally able to register it - which was a real pain as it wouldn't allow me to log on.Oh yeah like many others getting the battery access panel opened was a monumental task. I finally got it open by gently wedging a knife blade between the unit and the cover - stupid design.,4,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"I like that it is easy to use, there is a diversity of apps that are available.

"We put this in my husband’s tv in his workshop so that he can watch Netflix and Amazon Prime videos plus some others. We didn’t want to go to the expense of putting yet another “box” in the shop so we opted for this with the hope it would communicate with our wi-fi. It did and, when the signal is weak, it slows down the speed so whatever we are watching still comes through without a hitch.So glad we went with this option!",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

I own 2 of the gen 3 “Pendant” style Fire TVs and this thing works much better than those. Im using this on a 1080p TV but the picture is still better than my gen 3s.

"I just crossed over from my 3rd gen Apple TV to this fire stick and I’m super impressed. The remote is excellent and sound quality is great. I love that I can turn on and off tv and control the tv volume with this remote. One note of advice when setting up. If you have a slightly older model HD television and you experience a technical difficulties. Try using each one of the HDMI ports until you find one that doesn’t glitch. I didn’t realize this until after getting off the phone with tech support. I unfourtantely had to call tech service because my TV is older but they where extremely helpful, where super friendly,  and more then anything patient.

"This firestick is OK at best.  The only issue I have with it is whenever I go to the ""x-ray"" to view the information about a show or movie, most of the time, it messes the up the audio.  When returning to the show/movie, I can see the lips move a second or so before the sound comes.  The only way to line it up again is to restart the firestick.This happens a lot.",2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"Fraudulent, none of the app allow for 4K playback. Not Hulu, Not Netflix, Not YouTube, and Not Vudu. I try it on all 4K tv in the house and nothing only standard HD.

"Our old fire tv stick started crashing every time a commercial came on, so we upgraded to the 4K voice remote fire tv stick. It worked great for almost 6 months. I have tried unplugging, restarting and reconnecting it to the internet, but it still crashes every time we use the voice search feature. I was also never successful in getting our Echo to work with it. It may be time to try a Roku....",1,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"Nice while it worked, however the remote stopped working after 2 months. The buttons for the volume still work but we can no longer control anything else.

"We had the original Fire TV that was packaged in a 4 1/2x 4 1/2 x 5/8 inch package plus remote control.  The box has been replaced by a ""stick"" and the remote control is much improved.  The voice recognition has always impressed me.  I bought the Fire TV 4K stick because my old box could not handle DirecTV NOW which is what I decided to subscribe.  AMAZON really beat APPLE on this product with the voice recognition on the original.  I had both and the VR quickly made Fire the go to device.",5,1,2019-2-5,1,0,0

"The world of streaming all in one place. We have the Fire TV Stick without 4K capability and liked it and as I kept researching how powerful it can be, I really enjoy it a lot. The 4k is a nice jump though especially in conjunction with a top notch wireless network. Once the streaming services go with more 4K content, it'll get even better! There's one negative issue to point out it's the fact that the product can overheat and shut itself down which has happened once to me. The product case needs to be vented to keep the unit cool. That must be one of the next improvements.",4,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"I don't usually write reviews but I will for this thing. I've had a ROKU 2 for must be 5+ years. It was getting slow and the FF and RV were not working very well so I decided that I would ""upgrade"". Ordered a new ROKU premiere 4k, but it turned out to be worse than the older model. Did my usual amount of over research on the web and decided to try the Fire.  I've had it for 2 weeks now and it's been a solid performer, much faster. The Amazon Prime interface is a little weird, it seems to change format at times and I can't find the genre section sometimes. And apparently ""disaster"" CrunchyRoll does not work now, whatever the hell CrunchyRoll is? (Wife)Overall I'd say its a good choice. Can't see paying 5X for the apple product.",4,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0
"I had the original FireTV Stick for about 3 years, and just upgraded to the 4K version.  I was not at all expecting it to be so much faster than the original.  Internet and stream speeds are greatly improved, scrolling through menu items is much faster, and the updated remote was much needed.  Definitely recommend getting this if you are thinking of upgrading!",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
Rating 3 purely because mine constantly are crashing apps. Not sure why or what is going on since my previous ones never did it.Love the firestick but unfortunate to keep crashing and slow.,3,1,2019-8-13,1,1,0
"I had a firestick before I purchased this one and didn’t really like it. It was slow, lagged often, and was just overall disappointing. I was convinced that fire sticks were just bad products.

"This 4K version was supposed to be a great improvement over the original Fire Stick, but the same problems remain.  The Stick does not remain ""paired"" with the TV and the troubleshooting instructions do not solve the problem; I had to resort to YouTube videos which provide different solutions than those that accompany the Stick, but even those do not work permanently.  I have read many on-line criticisms of the Fire Stick and complaints that Amazon is aware of the problems but has failed to fully resolve the issues.  I will be returning mine for a refund because I have downloaded the Netflix app on my phone and now use my phone as the remote; so far, so good; much better than the Stick.",1,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0
I really liked the customer service. I did have a hard time getting things loaded and bought the ethernet connecter which I did not need. I thought a lot of the shows were free but are only loadable if you have a provider so what is the sense in getting it? I was able to use my brothers account but if not I don't know what would be available just through the internet.,5,1,2019-2-15,1,1,0
"My favorite thing so far is that when I tell Alexa what I want to watch, she'll fetch it without me having to search through our various streaming apps to find which one it's on.  I'm very happy with the picture, and that I can use just the fire stick remote to control what I'm watching and the volume.  Another benefit is that it loads immediately.  The smart tv takes a minute to load the apps on its own.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
I got this to replace my old fire stick since it was cheaper than buying a replacement remote only to find out that the remote only works when it feels like it and will randomly freak out and scroll till it can’t anymore. The voice recognition doesn’t work and the LED indicator only worked for the first two minutes. The only reason I gave this hunk of junk 2 stars instead of 1 is because I’m hoping it’s just a faulty remote (which my first one broke within a week).  The fire stick itself seems to be fine.  I really hope amazon gets their crap together and actually makes a remote that works one day. I’m 0 for 2 thus far.,2,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
I ordered this because my firebox remote stopped working and I was not able to get any support! The fire stick worked well the first couple of days and then would not recognize my network. I again tried to get support with no response. After logging into fire tv on my IPad I was able to finally get it on 2 of my televisions. The next day I was only able to get the fire stick to work on 1 television but only by logging into the iPad first.,4,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
I'm being sent a new one because the volume doesn't work on my new 4k. I've tried everything to try to get it to work including calling Amazon customer service. I'm glad I have older ones for backup,1,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
My previous Fire Stick did not work and I was very disappointed because I missed some games. However - this one works perfectly! Thank you so much. I don't have to page through layers of menu's any more - Alexa gives it to me in a few seconds. Very Happy!,5,1,2019-9-24,1,1,0

"I love everything about the firestick from start to the actual use of it in my programming. I gave up direct tv and went with the Amazon fire stick with all its possible programs. I chose Hulu because of its live tv and cloud dvr functions as well as their movies and Netflix to round out my movie choices. Everything I need to do to watch any broadcast is done with one piece of equipment, the fire stick. It also has alexa built in so I don't even have to look for the programs or movies I want, just ask alexa! The cost was very reasonable. The firestick plus Hulu and Netflix works out to be less then half of what I used to pay for basic tv through direct tv. The only thing you will need is a smart tv with an HDMI connection and wifi. I highly recommend that you give this some thought and save yourself some money.",5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,1
I’ve had both and it’s well worth the upgrade to the 4K edition. It runs way faster it seems and the universal remote function is worth it just for that. I upgraded all our fire TVs to this version.,5,1,2019-10-26,1,1,0
"This fire stick 4k constantly freezes the stream with Att tv now (formerly DirecTV Now).  I can change shows and it resumes but it is very disruptive.  I do not have that problem with my non 4k fire sticks, older Roku sticks or Roku Ultra.  I don't have issues on any device with Amazon prime content, and for that it works great with my Samsung 4k TV for 4k content.  I really wanted it to work, and tried being patient and updating but it has been months.  I'm going to Roku 4k devices due to the freezing issue and in part because the Roku interface is easier to navigate.",3,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
"I must say that this version of the Fire TV Stick is a vast improvement over the 1st generation stick. Not only is the picture much better, my streaming experience is much improved and the speed you can navigate through the user interface is greatly improved. Since we cut the cords and dropped our sattalite connection, I was worried we would have to go back due to the speed of the old stick, now I am confident that was a good move thanks to the new Fire TV Stick.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
This Firestick 4K is incredibly awesome super fast and when plugged directly into the router very little buffering. Runs just as good of not better than the Fire TV Cube.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product especially at this really affordable sale price it's a steal,5,1,2018-11-24,1,1,0
"The most important thing I have to say is: What took me so long to purchase this wonderful product. The difference it made with my wireless streaming apps was staggering. The picture is actually as good and probably better than my on my LED TV hardwired Verizon cable box picture. Having all my streaming apps in one place with a voice activated remote is a thing of beauty. Only negative thing I have to say is how unbelievably difficult it was to open the remote to install the batteries. It's crazy that they can develop this wonderful piece of hardware, that is unbelievably easy to set up and is so user friendly but can't make a remote that doesn't take 20 frustrating minutes to open. Ridiculous! So concerned about reopening remote again, that I did not even shut the back of the remote completely. By the way absolutely everyone has that same complaint. Other than that, I urge you to order this right away and don't wait. You don't know what your missing, especially if you are streaming wirelessly. Added bonus, the price was reduced 15 dollars due to the holiday season. So hurry up and order this right now, you will be ecstatic, that is once you open the remote and start streaming.",5,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
This is my third Amazon Fire product. First was one of the first firesticks. Then the Amazon Firetv.  This is by far the best of the group. It is very fast operation wise. Kinda expected that from what I had read. The best part of the 4k is the improvement in download speed. I pay for 100mbs and have never come close to that before. This unit on a bad day it may dip to 70mbs. Normal day is in the 90 range. At 50 bucks it is great. Catch it on sale for 35 and it is  off the charts. Buy it if you are into streaming !!!!!,5,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0
"Firestick TV is the perfect option for TV's that aren't so smart! Installation is simple, quality is superb, and access to the streaming world greatly enhanced. Once in place, provided your wireless signal strength is adequate, streaming is totally seamless. We own two so that grandkids have access to Disney+ in a separate room. Raised my TV's IQ by 50 points!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Really nice product, highly recommend. Please do not forget to add Amazon prime!I have one negative comment but not with this product but about my old fire stick.

"I miss being able to toggle between the channel you're watching and the last channel viewed. Until now, I didn't realize how much I do that.Also, If you use Alexa to do a search while you are in your streaming service, i.e. Youtube, Alexa will search everywhere, which knocks you out of Youtube while she's searching IMDb and everywhere else for the show you want.  You then have to log back into Youtube. I stopped using this feature on the first day.",3,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"I am so happy to see how they have improved this firestick compared to the old one. I can control my tv along with my media streaming services seamlessly.

"The voice recognition is awesome! I like the fact that I can say what I am looking for and it will just take me to it. For example, we have only one tv and my husband likes to play his video games from time to time which changes the settings a bit on the television. I was feeling a bit lazy and didn't want to look for the other remote control to change the setting on the TV and instead, I tried voice recognition and took me to the setting I want. I was pleasantly surprised. I order another one for my dad.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0

"It worked great for the first month. Now a month and 7 days later it is useless. The fire stick does nothing but turn off the tv and change the volume settings. You can not watch anything or even access the device. I'm very disappointed because the closing date to return was Sept. 28th and it is October 7th, a week outside of the return window. So now we spent $50 on something that within one month does not work. VERY UNSATISFIED.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0

Don’t do it. Works for about 30-40 minutes then it drops the signal for a brief moment and then sends you back to the main menu.  Very frustrating then you call “tech support” and some non english speaking person tells you it’s your wifi that’s the problem.  Really because everything else doesn’t drop signal in my home.  Good luck. Tried two. Returning both. Second one dropped quicker than the first,1,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

Everything is fine except I wish the development team would make the following changes in the next version:  1)  Provide more storage space without having to resort to extra cabling or complicated routines.  Just change to 25GB.  2) Allow the ability to restrict downloads in setup using the PIN.  We have two of these at a rental property and the tenants keep downloading whatever they want.  3) Add an INPUT button that will control the TV's input to get back to cable.  4) Get creative and design a user interface option that allows the user to simplify the app choices. 5) Have it light up in the dark like the Echo device.

I am already a Prime member and I don't get that message on any of the other devices (ROKU, Tablet, Android phone, computer).  When I go back to the device I started the movie or show on I can continue with no problem. Only thing I really like about the Fire Stick is the VLC media player which Roku doesn't have.

The ESPN app has is for some reason uninstalled every single time I turn on my fire TV stick on.

"The main issue I have with Fire Stick is that Amazon bathes you in app shortcuts (most pay) that you can't get rid of.  Everything you glance at gets a recent view entry. The parental control section is okay. Unfortunately, many (most) of the free media apps don't have any parental controls and don't use the one from Fire. Definitely limits what we can have loaded on the Fire stick.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I've had it for a month now (will update if any issues arise).So far, this 4k stick blows over the older firestick I had. I got the upgrade due to the faster processesor and 4k capability for when I decide to upgrade to 4k TV. The speed of this device made me happy, it no longer got stuck, apps didn't crash, and so far hasn't reset on me, all as my old firestick would. Also, even though I don't have a 4k TV, the image clarity is far superior than my older firestick. Another big plus is being able to turn on and control volume on the TV, I believe and arc HDMI input is needed for this, but could be wrong.

Bought this as a replacement for an older model fire stick.  Disappointed that they still have done nothing to make it easier to open the remote up that first time to insert the batteries.  The indention for pressing your thumb against is almost non-existent and the slick nature makes it impossible to grip and push the cover down.  In the modern age of technology it should be possible to engineer this thing to open up a little easier.,3,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"We bought 4 of these devices to replace the satellite service. When you are doing the cost analysis you assume you aren’t going to have to be replacing equipment every few months but unfortunately we had to replace one of the firesticks within just a few months of purchasing it. I am almost positive the remote is the issue but customer service was not very helpful and it’s about $10 more for the complete device rather than just the remote so obviously most people are just gonna buy the device again, which is what we did. It’s easy to use and overall the firestick provides a comparable amount of entertainment in comparison to cable or satellite but seeing that only 3 out of 4 devices have properly functioned in a period of about a year I can’t give a super high review. The firestick should come with at least a 2-3 year warranty.",3,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0

I no longer need to point the remote directly at the television in order for commands to be followed, I am able to control everything by simply saying ""Alexa..........""

I have cut the cable and gone with a streaming service with a Firestick at each tv.

Now, I can control everything (volume, on/off, and source) with the stick remote, alone,  No more remote to turn the TV on, or raise/lower the volume.

"I generally love this thing. I also have one of the older ones but this model has a few additional buttons - volume control and a tv power button. Those little upgrades are awesome.

No matter how many times I enter the wifi password or hit the wps button, it just will not connect. At first I thought it was an issue with my internet so I was constantly resetting it but I realized all my other devices were connected and working fine. And when I say not connecting, I mean it would say my password was incorrect or that the wps was being used by another device even neither of those things were true.

Not all I was told it to be. Yes there are lots of channels but most ask for cable providers information so these apps will disappear if and when you unsubscribe from cable company. Also don't like the so called guide most apps use. It would be hard to try to find programs in advance without scrolling through countless channels trying to find something to watch. On the positive side there is always something that interests you and the cost is very reasonable so I rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars.

I hope this was a one-off and it won't happen again.",4,1,2019-5-27,1,0,0
Picture quality is great and this definitely seems faster and smoother than the previous version but not by a wide margin. Alexa is fairly responsive to voice commands.

Price point is good. Works easily enough. Pretty fool-proof actually. My voice seems to be challenge for the remote to understand but my phone gives me the same troubles.

Guess I will be searching for a new device.",1,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"Picture and sound pull to 4k quality, no glitched easy setup as a fire stick does.  One suggestion is to buy the Cat5 cable adapter attachment also to plug into your router/modem directly to not have any 5G disturbances.  If using WIFI it picks up both 5.1GHz and 2.4Ghz bands and default is 5GHz, many devices on the network may interfere such as cell phones, X-Box etc.Enjoy",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

Having recently purchased a Fire-TV to enable watching of a particular streaming service in an upstairs room, I decided to take Amazon up on its offer of $25 off a Fire TV Stick.  Plugged it in and had it up and working in less than 5 minutes.Pros: great picture, reliable service over wireless, Alexa able to switch inputs on TV so that finding the TV remote isn't required.",5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0

However, we are now unable to receive the video portion of the program. We can hear the audio and see the superimposed cast list and time remaining in the show, but  otherwise the screen is black. There is no video. As a test, we tried to watch ""Jack Ryan"" 4k video and have the same issue. We can watch all other programming, so the issue seems to be with the 4k programming. Support suggested a software update, but that did not fix the problem.",1,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
I'm so glad I finally purchased the new upgraded model of the ever-so-popular Fire TV Stick. Everything looks so much better now on my 4K TV and it seems the new Fire Stick is also a bit faster as well. Installing was simple and easy. The new remote is amazing as it syncs very easily and quickly with my TV to adjust volume. And I love being able to invoke Alexa with the press of a button on the remote.

A cube you can tell to change input or turn on or off tv, but if you have this connected to (arc) hdmi input you can use an echo dot or plus in same room to turn on TV by saying open Netflix.  Also if tv is currently on different input you can say same command and it changes to the input the firestick is on.  Can't turn off tv which if you have a tv that was made in the last 5 years should turn off on its own if no buttons have been used in 4hrs.  All in all better than the cube.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0

Fire stick 4K. Everything works well.  I did read that I would be able to toggle between tv input so that I wouldn't have to use my tv remote but it does not do that or I would have given it 5 stars.

I don't notice a huge improvement, or degradation in quality between this and the second gen fire tv.

"I kept getting an HDMI input error / no picture when installing the new 4k stick.  The solution for me was to follow the Amazon website instructions to force the stick into 1080p temporarily then making settings changes in the firetv stick and the LG B8 menus.  (holding up and rewind buttons for 20 seconds to change resolution).  The LG then needed to have Ultra Deep HDMI turned off in the pictures menu (so only HDR signals, not Dolby Vision).  The stick could then be set to be always 2160 at 60hz in the settings display menu, and 10 bit color.  I'm impressed with the 4K HDR color streaming on Amazon Prime, even though the Dolby Vision Color might have been slightly better.",5,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0

"The updated fire stick is great! We have both an older version and the updated smaller foot print with improved remote. A few suggestions to make it really terrific. 1) update the firmware to do a better job buffering the video streams, 2) one more button on the remote to change the input, as most TVs are not defaulted to a single HDMI port or the hotel TVs will constantly reset to their input channel",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0

Took me a few tries to see my apps (honestly, probably operator error!), but once I got past that hiccup, it's all been a breeze. The menu is very intuitive and easily navigated. No headaches trying to find the right app, or category or specific movie. The stick also has a very nice search function.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
Works just as well as the other firestick. Can't really tell the 4k quality though.  Looks more like 720p or 1080p And if your using a surround sound receiver you have to put it on stereo otherwise it cuts out the audio constantly. Which is a huge pain in the a**.  I'd save the extra $ and just go with the standard. Seems to be a better product in my opinion.,2,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

I use mine so much that now with the new Hulu live tv, I'm probably gonna cancel my cable. But......., the home button. Maybe it's just me, but I wish it were in a different place on the remote. I hit it by mistake SOOOO much because it's right in the middle of everything. When I go to hit the volume, I hit the home button, when I go to hit the back button, I hit the home button, it just seems like a magnet where it's at now. And the battery life for the remote. Idk what the deal is, but I have went through so many batteries in these remotes. I've had tv and other remotes go months and months on batteries.

How Amazon could possibly have allowed through QA a product which doesn't even play the most basic of streams (encoding standard has been out since the '90s and is the basis for all US TV) is beyond me.  Further, from what I've read online, Amazon has known about this for months and hasn't yet released a fix, and has no plans to disclose a timeline for the fix.  Had I known any of this pre-purchase I would have bought an Azulle Access or other platform which actually works.

It's annoying when you sit down and get comfy only to find out that you need to get back up to unplug the device and plug it back in.

I subscribed to the Hulu local channel plan for $40 and now control Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and many more apps with just one remote either by voice or buttons. It's great and saved me $70 a month over my old Dish plan. The TV's and sound bars power up from the Fire Stick when the TV does and volume is controlled by both with the Fire Stick 4K. I love voice surfing YouTube and the internet with the Amazon Silk browser. If you are looking for simplifying control and saving money, I highly recommend streaming with the new Amazon 4K Fire Stick.",5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
"The quality is good for the price, I recently cancelled Satellite TV because there is never anything on TV anymore worth paying for.  I wish it had a larger, more powerful etc... ""something"" as it still buffers once in a while.  20X better than the original I bought years ago, but I was hoping for perfection, especially since I have internet of 40 Mbps.",4,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
The On-Off and Volume Control that works for my TV is definitely worth the extra $10. I've had to occasionally power-reset the Firestick because it loses comm with our Amazon over-the-air DVR but other than that it's great. Don't load it down by having too many Apps installed.,4,1,2019-4-30,1,1,0
"This thing is as fast as a roku ultra which is saying a lot.  I was so happy to see the 4K model with the new remote and no more laggy menu's, and app launching.  If you have any of the previous sticks and were unimpressed with the responsiveness this is a thing of the past with this model.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
"We use the FireStick in combination with the Dish Anywhere app mainly.  We have found that if you try to review your timers in the DVR, the FireStick freezes and has be restarted.  If you try to fast forward or rewind too quickly, it freezes and has to be restarted.  There have been many times, especially recently, where we have been watching a show and then find that we have been taken all the way back to the home screen and have to start the app again.  When we check the Wireless Connection, it says the signal is very good.  This is our second FireStick in 6 months.  We tried the non 4K first, but it would buffer a lot.  We had been having better luck with the 4K until recently.  Leaving a step stool in the family room so that the FireStick can be unplugged and replugged in when it freezes is getting a little old.",2,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
Much to my surprise this firestick came programmed for my network. I was trying to figure out how to connect it to my network when i resorted to the instructions and discovered that the unit came with the network access information already installed. Big Brother really is watching.The process was really easy and completely functional within a few minutes.,5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"The Firestick is amazing! I bought it because our smart TV is older and no longer supported by several apps. Thanks to the Firestick, I can still access Prime Video, Netflix, Disney +, anything really. It’s easy to use and great quality. My one complaint is that I wish the remote was bigger, or that it would beep on command. My kids seem to always be losing it.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I specifically purchased the Firestick to stream FaceBook live virtual video exercises but I’m very disappointed in Facebook Watch, it’s not user friendly and did not allow me to search (no keyboard on the remote).Also, #2 it made my movies widescreen with black at the top and bottom and I tried all settings on the stick and in my tv system settings and could not fix the problem. It distorts the way people look :(",2,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"This product was a gift.  It 99.9 % can replace cable or Directv.  Works well, and has tons of movies.  Performs exactly as it should.  With Firestick offering everying cable does, and for waaaaaaaaay less (pretty much just the cost of the sitck), why do you neeed cable.  I'll be reducing out cable to the basic package.  We do still need it in order to access NFL Sunday Ticket Live.  Cable can have their modem back, I bought one.  Our bill will be reduced significantly.",5,1,2019-1-7,1,1,0
Not any better than the 2nd Firestick I had😕 which I loved but unfortunately just died.....They didn't say that it could turn volume up & down & off & had a better picture etc etc! If all those things worked on the 4th Gen it would be great but they don't(:-  It's just the same as the 2nd one which I loved and it was what they said it was! Allot of extra buttons that don't do a thing😔 I should have saved the extra money & gone with the older version!,3,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
"We are in love with the fire stick! It is not only super easy to setup but it easily beats the Apple TV for streaming purposes. We recently subscribed to sling and my wife’s Sony Bravia didn’t have the capability of accessing sling! While it is a smart TV, fire stick makes it so easy to have all your apps easily accessible. Quality is crystal clear. I love that you can ask Alexa questions on the remote and she answers!",5,1,2019-4-20,1,0,0
"I received this is a Christmas gift from my son. I was hesitant to install it, as I have used Roku for streaming for several years. However, I knew I would likely get better service and more features because my Roku box was one of the first generation devices. The Amazon Fire Stick was easy to install and set up; I just followed the included instructions and the prompts on the screen. The stream quality is fantastic. I have not used the Alexa feature much, but when I have used it, it's worked great. No regrets about switching from Roku to Amazon Fire Stick.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
The best streaming device after Apple TV. I've had a roku and google chromecast. Neither compares to the fire stick. #1 you can search the web! #2 you can download anyyyyy app. #3 voice recognition is AWESOME.  I wish I knew then what I know now I would've saved tons of money by not buying other streaming devices. Definitely get the remote cover because it can easily slip out your hands. This device is too precious not to protect the most valuable part. Fire stick 4k is a yes for me dawg. I live in Hollywood so I guess I can say YOU'RE going to Hollywood lol,5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
This replaced the original fire tv which still worked but had become very slow to respond and load. Thefire stick 4k is fast.  Easy to install as always.  Beautiful picture.  One nice and convenient feature is the ability to click the home button on the remote to switch input from tv to fire tv.  Much faster and easier.  Also appreciate the volume control on the remote.,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
Don't buy this garbage.  This device is simply a platform for the commercialization of your products.  It totally destroys the viewing experience.  The remote control is so simplistic that it allows your paid subscribed services to force commercials down your throat.  Only buy this if you like being patronized and objectified.  I guess Corporations can't get greedy enough.  Ridiculous......,1,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"The stick lives up to its advertising. I experienced two problems. After many attempts to get my sound system to operate with the stick, I gave up and am stuck with a weak internal sound system. The second problem: the navigation system to enter channels and services like HBO, Starz and others needs a lot more transparent guidamce. I ended up spending WAY TOO MUCH time setting and customizing the overall system. Once those hours were passed, I must say the stick works well. Be prepared for some ""Installation Frustration"" and unrecovered time, as in more than in hour.",3,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
Some of my apps kept going in and out or shutting down and after much research figured out that I needed an adapter with more voltage .  so I purchased an adapter from Amazon for eight bucks and everything seems to be fine.  I would have given this five stars except for the fact that they don’t give you an adapter with enough voltage to make it all happen.  This is the second fire stick that I have bought and am buying a second adapter.,3,1,2020-7-6,1,1,0
"If you are techie you probably will have no trouble with the Firestick. I am not a techie and found the directions to be very poorly written assuming people have some knowledge. I can read and follow directions, but these directions didn't give me enough guidance. Called the help number and ended up with a foreign speaking guy that said my modem had been hacked and I needed to go to this other company and give them my passwords and they would debug my system. At that point I said no! Hired my tech person to come over and help me. Her advice after working for over 2 hours to connect to my smart TV - return them and get the Roku. That's what I did.",1,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"Bought this when Amazon quit supporting Prime Video on my Sony Blueray player.  It was extremely easy to install and works perfectly.  Actually much easier to view Netflix and streaming aps in addition to Prime than it was using my previous Sony device.  And I can now do everything with one small remote, rather than the three (TV, Blueray player, soundbar) as was necessary before.",5,1,2019-11-9,1,1,0
"we changed our rating because Amazon refuses to support Vudu, I think you make enough money without having to block people from getting their digital media collection. because of this we have to switch back and forth to Roku in order to watch our digital collection on Vudu. you make claims that people can watch it through another app, but this is not true. movies anytime does not support or have contracts with all of the companies. so you barely get any content have your digital collection in Vudu through that app. quit being jerks Amazon! although fire tv stick is lacking when it comes to available apps, we can use the browser to access Amazing Facts and our church website. so other than the lack of apps, and Amazon's greed i would have given a 5 star rating.",1,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"I was tired of having to connect my computer to my tv to stream movies so I bought this as an early Christmas present to myself. Love it!

Should have done this long ago. Love it!",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"We don't have an Alexa but this is exactly what I needed. Our TV in the bedroom was slow to connect to the internet and gave issue when using nextflix, which btw was the only app the TV had on it.

"So far, I like it very much. However, I could have traded in my used one but for some reason Amazon didn't recognize that I had want. Unfortunately I'm kind of stuck with it. I do as friends if they want it but so far no takers. Be great if I could get a credit for it by sending it back to Amazon. That was the offer at the time but for some reason Amazon didn't recognize that I already had a fire stick",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0

"Works very well. The dongle for my LG smart TV failed and the Firestick provides much more capability and costs less than a new dongle. Very happy now that I can access a Netflix, Prime, YouTube and others for free (Some memberships required). Alexa works well.

"This is a really easy way to watch all our favorite subscriptions in one place! We watch Prime, Hulu, Netflix, and more. It is easier to work than our SmartTV. Easy to setup for the most part. Plug it in and go. We had to watch a YouTube video to get the darn battery in he remote. Ended up using a small screw driver to pry it open.

"Ordered 5 - 4K Fire Sticks as our cable company now offers a streaming cable service for a much cheaper price. They are extremely simple to connect to the TV as well as Netflix & Amazon Prime. Alexa integrates seamlessly with the remotes. All TV are labeled per location in the house so Alexa know which TV to control through the remote. The only hiccup was the TV out on the deck was not receiving a strong enough wireless signal so I added a Amazon Fire TV ethernet adapter. I think the ethernet adapter actually is better because you are not dependent on wireless signal. If the Fire Stick TV ever buffer, I will add ethernet adapters to all TV's. I'm running 50Mbps on fiber without any buffering currently.",5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"I had a free-but-old TV from my friend, and my apartment does not allow me to have free cable. In these circumstances, the Fire Stick was my life-saver for my free TV!

I am so grateful to Amazon to make this product! :D Love it, and HIGHLY recommend for sure!",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0

There also seems to be issues with running some apps, even though you already have a subscription for that channel through my AT&T account.",3,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"This purchase has been a waste of time and effort. The HDR feature doesn't work properly with this 4K Fire TV Stick. The UHD/4K/HDR video image comes in washed out and with muddy shadows. There is no way to defeat the HDR to avoid the bad image quality. I'm using a UHD/4K/HDR compatible Onkyo AV receiver and a UHD/4K/HDR compatible Sony LED television. I have an AppleTV 4K that is hooked up to the same system and HDR works perfectly. I need an application that my AppleTV doesn't offer, but the Fire TV Stick does. I spent 1.5 hours with Amazon customer service to finally be told to call Sony. The Sony television is not the problem. I will have to purchase a Roku instead.",2,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I've had this since January, replaced an older version so it had been relegated to that less frequently used TV since the other was already a smart TV.

I have both a fire tv and a firestick given me as gifts. I found both were not needed so the firestick is in a drawer. My sincere opinion is you all have went to a lot of trouble to control what folks see. Alexa works okay but it is much too time consuming to download apps for programs you wish to use. I understand streaming so know it is mostly to provide competitive service without cable. Too much of your streaming service requires payment after 7 days. Too many folks have their fingers in the cookie jar....Being a Comcast customer I assumed I could stream cable from my existing router. Your fire tv will let me see some Comcast networks & not others per app choices. Even my android phone & old tablet allow me to watch my full Comcast lineup including local programming. I had to buy a digital antenna to get local stations on your tv.,3,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"We dropped our local cable tv company after their prices got so high that we just couldn't justify keeping them.

"I love Amazon Fire TV Sticks. I have purchased every generation of Fire TV Sticks produced by Amazon. I own 6 of them, three of which are 4K. However, I have four constructive wishes. 1.) Provide more internal memory, possibly 16GB to 32GB. 2.) Provide for external memory attachments (usb drives) that are accessible by games, movies, utilities and other downloads. 3.)  Please, allow the customer to opt-out of features that are added unknowingly with software upgrades. The latest was Free-Time and others include Amazon Music and Amazon Photos. 4.)

Once this happens, if you press the “back button” to exit the show/movie and go back to the previous page, the Fire Stick will freeze and the screen goes black. You then have to turn it off and back on for it to work properly again, until it happens again. Other than that, I haven’t noticed any other issues.

Then it goes back to black, then the white and so on and so forth and never goes to the homepage.  It gets stuck in this cycle and I have no idea how to fix it.  The first time it fixed itself after about 20 minutes.  Today though, it's been stuck for hours.
