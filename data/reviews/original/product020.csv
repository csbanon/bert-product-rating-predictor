Does not hold a charge,1,1,2018-5-5,1,1,0
"Similar to some other negative reviews I have seen of this speaker, it does not last even close to 7-8 hours. It dies after 3.5 hours on a full charge. Very disappointing. Strangely, it is never on ""low"" battery. It dies while on medium.",1,1,2017-11-9,1,2,0
"This is the first Bose I’ve ever owned. SO excited to upgrade my music. And at first, it was the BOMB! I was literally in tears listening to songs I’ve known for decades, realizing I’d been missing so much. Not just bass, but an extra trill here, a run I’d neverheard, a violin, and extra guitar riff. Truly glorious hearing the fullness of the music as it was played. The battery life was awesome. It also didn’t drain my iPhone even for many hours at my Labor Day cookout. It won’t blast the guy down the block with volume, but who wants to be that chucklehead anyway?! Syncimg was a snap. And it DOES play while charging. Here’s the sucky part, and why I returned it to Bose: the physical volume buttons on the speaker did not work. At all. Not even a little bit. And this was from right outta the box. After 3 days of fiddling with it, I called Bose, (20 min hold!) explained the issue, and she started trying to walk me through a reset that was also clearly NOT correct. (She kept telling me to press and hold the power button until the language selection voice prompt came on. The language selection is not on the power button. It’s on the multi-function button. This is in the manual. I mentioned this. This did not register with her. Sigh.)",3,1,2020-9-12,1,2,0
THIS IS JUNK. My original review was good but after the first year it started to do strange things and now at just uner two years it is useless. In the last year it started to refuse to charge from a USB wall chargers. It will ONLY charge from a computer or tablet. It will not charge while playing. So at two years it may need a new battery ($45+) or a trash can. It only plays for 1.5 hrs and then takes 3-4 to charge to only 1/3 full and will not charge any farther. The new firmware provides no indication of charging and the thing seems to be on standby all the time.  So it goes totally DEAD in a week of not using it.  B O S E  is now junk.  These problems are easy to find on the web. Many of them are dead or dying.,1,1,2017-10-15,1,9,0
"I really like this refreshed version. It sounds great. I took it to the beach and left it on the night stand and played music and it was loud enough and sounded good. Ive had other Bose speakers that are in a box now not being used because they sounded terrible. These sound good. Audiophiles hate Bose but for the majority of people they're a good step up in class. All the brands in the 350-400 over the ear headphone range sound exactly the same. You have to spend way way up there to get something that sounds different. I tried on some 1800 headphones and it sounded like I was in a big room listening to music, that was okay but all my beats, b&o, Sony, Bose headphones sound good too just not like your in a huge room having sound come at you. I can see where some people would appreciate that but that's not what Americans have been used to, that's something unique that not everyone needs and they were huge and lacked technology even though they sounded good using old tech from long ago. Plus, no name brand recognition. I've found an apple music subscription with an apple headphone (beats) and apple wire are very much optimized to work together and if you have apple music you want beats, they're tuned for them perfectly.",5,1,2019-3-11,1,4,0
"I'm not one to trash a product knowing that user error can in many cases cause an unsatisfactory experience but in this case I'm going to trash this product.  First, the item was used for less than a total of 24 hours worth of play time over the course of a year.  After returning from the beach the item was set on the shelf and left for about 6-8 months.  When I returned to charge the device and use it, guess what.....it didn't work.  I tried numerous attempts to get the device to turn on or even take a charge.  After visiting the Bose forums and doing some research it appears that the device goes into a ""sleep"" mode if not used for a period of 2 weeks.  I attempted on numerous occasions to follow the trouble shooting ideas within the Bose forums and via YouTube but nothing worked.  I finally broke down and called Bose to attempt to trouble shoot with them over the phone and was told ""well the device is out of warranty and you have tried all the troubleshooting ideas so....let's just get you a new one.....that'll be $129.99 or you can send the one you have back and for only $75 you can have a refurbished one""  I'm sorry Bose, why would I buy another one when the first one didn't  hold up and was caused by a known issue that you have purposely installed in your firmware.  After additional attempts I was able to get some lights to come on temporarily but still the device doesn't work.  Bose knows the issue exists and yet won't stand behind their product.  I wasn't looking to get a replacement or even a new one, but I was at least expecting for the price paid that I would get some legit support and not a sales pitch.  Never again Bose.....I should have listened to the old adage ""No high's, no low's, that's Bose"" and gone with a different product.",1,1,2019-5-25,1,5,0
"I have only had this a few days, as of now, I am only giving it 2 STARZ. It does not keep its connection. Initially, I had it connected to a couple of different mobile devices at the same time. The next day, it would not stay connected to either device. It is supposed to search for the most recently connected device when you turn the speaker on, however it does not do that. I will give the manufacturer an opportunity to fix the problem. I will update my review at that time. I also used the recommended app, Bose Connect. The iPhone app did not work at all. The iPad app worked the first time, but not after the initial set up. I am not sure if this is a problem with the app, or the speaker.",2,1,2020-8-20,1,3,0
"Lets just hypothetically say that I bought this as a gift in December 2017 for an ungrateful person.  In September 2018 this same ungrateful person pissed me off, so naturally I decided to destroy this bose speaker. I ran water over it but i noticed the water rolling off. I then submerged it in water and watched until little bubbles formed.  I removed it and placed it back.  The next day,  this same ungrateful person is blasting perfect sound quality music from this damn speaker... al hypothetically of courseNeedless to say Bose has gained a loyal customer in myself",5,1,2018-10-8,1,5,0
"So I have had this speaker for just over a year. It still sounds very good. It has great battery life. Always connects to my phone or computer without issue. The rubber exterior is great for easy gripping and handling. I have never had a need to use it near water, so I cannot comment on splash resistance.Update: I have had this speaker for over 2 years.Still sounds fantastic. Still has great battery life. Guess I never had to, but now I use the microphone function. Since I have been working from home. I use this has a speaker/microphone as I have grown tired of wearing headphones all day. This connects to my work computer and i am able to use it for my Skype communication. Calls come in clear and I can be clearly heard by others.",5,1,2018-1-27,1,7,0
"I had this speaker for two days and returned it. The quality I know and expect from Bose was not found in this speaker. You know how you go to a store and they have a Bose display where you can test the speakers? You know how impressed you are with even the smallest Bose speaker's sound? Yeah, none of that happens with this speaker.The sound from this SoundLink speaker is tinny and unimpressive. I can honestly say my Kindle Fire HD 10 has a more crisp sound than this Bose speaker. There's barely any bass and if it's not placed directly in front of your ears you'd think it was a cheapo no-name $40 speaker.",2,1,2020-8-6,1,2,0
"The sound is fantastic and a perfect portable speaker.  Easy download for Bluetooth.  When active or playing music and your phone rings it will alert you through the speaker, nice feature.",4,1,2017-6-10,1,2,1
"So after two years of this speaker sitting on the same table and using this speaker once a day, I hadn't used it in a couple of weeks and it had fully discharged. I plugged it in and ran an errand for an hour. I came back to some sort of dystopian hell with the voice prompts loudly cycling through ""connected, not connected"" or something along those lines. It was so loud and the volume buttons don't seem to apply to the voice prompts, I was a bit concerned because I live in an apartment building and have neighbors who I am sure hated me due to this.I then remembered that I had to update the firmware one time so I searched for the updater app on Google to find Bose trying to get me to use the mobile app instead of desktop. I tried that via my iPhone but the update was painfully slow. If you've ever done a big update on an Apple Watch via Bluetooth imagine this but 10 fold. It could never finish due to the speaker deciding to randomly disconnect from bluetooth. This like the voice prompt cycling was another new behavior that came out of the blue (pun not intended).",1,1,2019-1-4,1,5,0
"Worked fine for a while, but for no reason it no longer plays sound even though the device is paired with my iPhone. A superficial search on google shows that the device in all it’s incarnations has this issue, going all the way back to 2012. From this, I’ve decided Bose has had plenty of time to get the bugs out of this device, so I’m asking Amazon for a full refund.",1,1,2018-6-11,1,4,0
I'm flight attendant and have literally turned my car back around to go back home and get it when I forgot it at home.It gives amazing sound that fills a car or room beautifully.,5,1,2018-1-20,1,4,0
"~edit: this has turned out to be EXTREMELY ANNOYING, I am going to try and return it~ The speaker sounds and looks amazing. There is only one thing that I don’t like about it... whenever you pause your music for too long or if you turn your music off the speaker will say “connected to (name)’s iPhone” repeatedly  until you turn off the speaker. Also, if you turn off your Bluetooth on your device but don’t walk over and turn off the speaker it will repeatedly say “ready to connect.” It’s surprisingly more annoying than you would think. It would be nice if there was a way to turn off this feature",3,1,2018-9-11,1,3,0
"The sound quality overall is pretty decent, and the speaker pairs easily with my phone. However this weird thing happened to me-- the speaker died and for some reason went into this mode and wouldn't recharge. I looked it up and apparently it's a common issue. I was able to fix the speaker by going through the factory reset process, but I had to try it multiple times before it turned on again. I also wish the speaker turned off automatically if it hadn't been used for a while, because I often drain the battery forgetting to turn it off.",3,1,2018-1-4,1,3,0
"I was happy with a lot about this one over my last two BOSE.It connected quickly, didn't drop randomly, not too base driven so music and podcasts sounded good and it seemed durable in terms of dirt and dust but without warning it stopped working in the middle of use sitting on my desk.",1,1,2019-9-6,1,1,0
"TBH initially I wasn't pleased with the sound of it at all! I've gotten so used to listening to music underneath the bump and vibration of (Beats) bass that I didn't recognize real quality any more. I didn't pay attention to the fact that I can clearly hear every instrument (individually) as well as every lyric spoke within the song playing. I didn't notice the awesomeness of this tiny little box until I was in a completely separate room away from it, yet I heard every sound described above in perfectly pristine quality as if the music was live & followed me into the next room. Suddenly I remembered the quality sound of the Bose products my parents owned. The beauty of clear, quality sound wrapping around you.The overall appearance of the speaker speaks to it not being a cheap reproduction. The texture is great to the touch. It feels very durable and is comfortable on the hands, easy to grip & carry.",5,1,2017-12-30,1,3,0
Super unhappy with the product. When I first received it it was perfect. No issues at all and really good quality sound. Within the first two months I had to keep troubleshooting the speaker because it’s known to just turn off or go into a power saving mode. But it’s finally just stopped troubleshooting all together and won’t come back on at all . Super sad I always loved the boss product,2,1,2018-1-14,1,3,0
"What an amazing little speaker! I listen to everything from classical, rock, pop and rap music and this speaker allows me to enjoy it all! Battery life is incredible. Easy to pair. Same quality you've come to love and expect from Bose.",5,1,2018-1-25,1,1,0
"Small, yet the sound quality is impressive.I appreciate it DOES NOT require an app that needs permissions to run and access to things like your contacts, location, all your photos like some other companies do.",5,1,2017-5-18,1,7,0
"It is OK and most people will be satisfied. Perhaps I should have spent more money and ordered a speaker with better sound quality for music listening.  But I wanted something small.  And in my opinion,  the pros outweigh the  cons.  The pros?  Pairs easily.  Small footprint.  Very nice design. Worth the price for what it is designed to do.  And importantly, at least for me, it is one of the very few bluetooth speakers available at this time that will work with the  new Amazon Echo Input which, I believe, is shipping now.  As far as I can determine, there are not yet a lot of speakers that will work with the Echo Input.  According to the list from Amazon, this one will.",4,1,2018-11-28,1,4,0
"I had the older Bose soundlink and I loved that one. I had it for a very long time, I got a ton of use out of it. The charging port somehow got moved and it was really hard to charge I had to literally hold it in. So I got this one a week or so ago and WOW! The sound quality is so much better than the older one! There are a bunch of new features, some annoying like it will read the number when someone calls. That drove me crazy but eve ty thing can be turned off. I like it. I’m afraid I won’t get the use out of the party mode, it sounds interesting but I don’t see much use for me personally. Oh the app that is recommended for whatever reason isn’t that good, maybe it’s user error but it kept freezing my phone and my phone is current on updates. I know this review isn’t for the app sorry I get side tracked! Ok for a Bluetooth speaker in the medium (this is medium to me idk I guess there are crazy expensive speakers out there...?) anything this speaker is perfect for me and for my usage! I use it practically all day and night, at night I plug it in and listen to sleep stories or sleepscapes on the calm app and it’s amazing it sounds so great!! I love the size i love that it is water resistant, this is the perfect little speaker!",5,1,2020-4-17,1,1,0
"I am a musician/songwriter/producer with a very discerning ear, and I was stunningly surprised by the sound of this little gem ... the bass response was the very first thing I heard, and I really didn't ""hear"" it, I FELT it - the volume was way down (just out of the box) and one of my cats looked very concerned as she hates thunder and thought that's what is WAS, (as did I) ... as I slowly turned it up the other frequencies kicked in and the clarity and sound quality clearly was just as impressive. The pairing is quick and seamless, the controls very user-friendly, and the volume it reaches without sacrificing quality is beyond surprising for such a size ... I swore I'd never spend a lot on bluetooth speakers, (as I own a recording studio and have a great stereo system there and in my house), so I got one of these at a bit over a Franklin, and within twenty minutes of listening to the Bose Soundlink Color II, I bought ANOTHER, as they can be used in tandem and in true STEREO. The sound of both is really superb, and comparable to my very expensive studio near-field monitors. I rarely take the time to write reviews for Amazon, (though I buy almost everything here), but I just HAD to share the joy and pleasure of these little bargains! I love the midnight blue color as well, the water-resistance, the non-slip texturing, and the amazing battery life. A++",5,1,2020-7-16,1,2,0
"I saw this Bose unit while looking for a blue tooth speaker to replace a different brand speaker I purchased from Costco that worked well & sounded good, while it worked.. then, after only a few months of gentle use (not played loudly)  it simply died one day. Disappointed in that brand, for sure. So, instead of all the return hassles, I figured why not try a better known 'high quality' brand from somewhere other than Costco. Bought this Bose Soundlink Color II for about $130.  then, after only a few months of gentle use (not played loudly)  it simply died one day. (Sound familiar?, LOL! gotta laugh so I don't scream,LOL!)  Disappointed in that brand also now, for sure.I don't know if these reviews are monitored.",1,1,2019-6-10,1,4,0
"I liked how easy the speaker was to set up as well as the ease of using the app (optional) to utilize the features this speaker has.This is it. The speaker itself did not have a deep range like a Bose speaker should be known for. As others have stated, when the speaker is turned up loud, bass suffers as a result and in turn, this speaker becomes tinny and cheap sounding. The only range where this sounds good is at 75% and lower.",1,1,2019-7-8,1,3,0
"I purchased the speaker in March 2017, and here 4 months later it has stopped working. I used the below method to reset the speaker and it's working fine again. strange bug for a product line that I've always enjoyed.Plug soundlink in to wall charger",3,1,2017-6-25,1,7,0
"Ok, even though I had read the product reviews and knew that people had trouble getting and keeping this speaker charged, I thought that I would be the exception. Turns out I wasn’t. The speaker comes with a cable for charging, but not a plug. So I used whatever I had around.I charged this speaker overnight, sometimes for days, and still when I turned it on it would say, ‘ Low battery.’",5,1,2020-7-17,1,1,1
This is really a terrible product coming from Bose. It has none of the usability or sound quality of their excellent headphones.* Sound quality is poor (bass heavy) and cannot be adjusted.,1,1,2018-7-8,1,2,0
"Stopped working after a year.  Called Bose to start process of repair.  They asked for the Serial Number (found at bottom of speaker); I read to them the number and they replied: ""This is not an authorized Bose product.""Several times I reread the SN and several times they searched.  Even if I wanted to pay to repair the speaker, Bose could not help because it is not a legit Bose speaker.",1,1,2019-2-11,1,1,0
"I am giving this product 3 stars as an average of three components:5 stars: The sound quality is great and the app/bluetooth works seamlessly with either my phone or my computer. Now that I've overcome the obstacles listed below, I am excited for a lifetime of using this product!",3,1,2018-12-2,1,5,0
"Love the Boze color soundlink for the great sound, I’ve had two others with more or less success as far as life span and ease of connectivity. Connectivity is almost always easy and good (this one occasionally has a little lag time from when it “says” it’s connected to your device to when the sound actually comes through). A negative of both of my other Colorlinks was the misalignment of the rubber cover and the charging port - causing difficulty in connecting the device for charging and eventually damaging the port. Also, short lifespan for one of my other Colorlinks. For this particular one, tho, so far/so good- except for the delayed connecting time. OH! ALSO! An annoying feature is that only 2 devices can be connected to the device at one time and if one of those is not disconnected, no other device can connect. In other words, you cannot disconnect other devices from the speaker, leaving you unable to connect to the speaker. It seems even if the other phones are within range.",4,1,2020-8-23,1,1,0
"I'm not happy with this product.  I bought it to pair with my MacBook Pro, but it hasn't worked out well at all.  The bluetooth connection constantly drops with no warning and then the only way to reestablish it is to simultaneously power the speaker, even though the speaker still has plenty of power!  The controls are very confusing, the human voice is difficult to understand (yes, I have her set to English), and the ""user's guide"" literature is a joke (but it's in 21 languages!).  There's marginally more information on the website- and that's where I learned to disable the powersaver feature- but I still haven't been able to employ the speaker with any consistency.  Right now I'm charging the speaker but the voice that used to give me the power status has gone silent.  The only reason I haven't returned it is because I was hopeful i could reach a tech support representative on the phone who could tell me what's going on, but I've been unsuccessful there on 2-3 attempts, left listening to ""a specialist will be right with you"" recording ad nauseum for 30+ minutes each time.  If my experience is any indication, Bose has lost its way.",1,1,2020-6-11,1,3,0
"I bought this to pair with an Echo Dot.  Setup was very easy - almost effortless.  Sound is much better than what the Dot, or even the full-sized Echo, can produce, and I am very pleased with its performance.Deducted one star because it comes with a charging cable only - the wall plug is not included.  I'm guessing their theory is that it will be charged by a computer and used on the go.  And, yes, ""everyone"" has a wall plug anyway.  But to package a product without all necessary accessories is just not right.",4,1,2017-1-19,1,1,0
"I always wanted to have a bose speaker. I finally bought it and love it! It sounds really great but I have used it’s for less than a month and I left it charging for 6 hours because I was going camping and when I got to camp it hadn’t charge, I thought my cable wasn’t working but I have charged other devices with it and worked perfect. I put it to charge today for 4 hours and when Ari turned it on it said “battery low” and shut off. I am kind of disappointed with this speaker. Specially because I have been wanting to get it’s for this long!",1,1,2018-5-2,1,2,0
"I like this speaker. I bought it to replace the Bose Soundlink speaker (original edition).  The sound is great, and it fits into the case I bought for the original, so that's nice.Now for the annoyances: The on/off, Bluetooth, and volume up+ and down- buttons are harder to press than on the original. The thing that bugs me the most is that they are VERY poorly marked--the icons are pale and almost impossible to see, so you have to look hard at them when you want to adjust something, until you know their placement and can do it by memory!",1,1,2017-7-18,1,4,0
"Don’t buy this!  I bought this in mid-January 2018 & within a month the power just went dead. It wouldn’t charge no matter what connecton I used.

"I read many of the reviews prior to purchasing.  I understand that many have made comments on issues with it not being 'easy' to connect or even to increase or decrease volume.  Understanding that information, I still decided to purchase. First of all, I love bose products and bose sound. I own several of their other products and will continue to own bose products.so, this is my review - the instructions that came with the speaker were poor at best.  while there isn't much to connecting a bluetooth, it simplly didn't give much info that was helpful.  I got mine paired with minimal effort, pushing buttons and using my phone to actually make sure the process worked well.  with that said, I had a very specific reason for ordering this particular bluetooth speaker; I wanted a speaker to use as a speaker phone, so I could enjoy having a phone call with family members that live away, while my hubby could participate as well.  This speaker seemed to offer the appropriate qualities to do that.  upon me trying to figure out how to do this, I became perplexed.  I watched youtube 'how-to' videos and again no answers.  I decided to call the bose customer service and spoke with a lovely person that listened to my request, put me on hold, went to their 'training lab', tried a few options and found a solution that worked for me.  yay!  I was soooooooo pleased.  I received actual great customer service without being on hold for hours and getting disappointed.  Now that i know how to make my speaker operate as I needed it to, I am very please with it.  it sounds great, and I can easily answer and place calls easily.  The only thing that is a bit annoying is that the volume up and down buttons have a slow response, but that is a minor issue.",4,1,2018-4-2,1,9,0

This little baby blasts! Really like this a lot - I am a long time bose fan. My only complaint is that I ordered white and I got a color that was more icy blue/gray. I know I got the right one bc the actual blue is VERY blue. Just a heads up to all that the white is not a true white. ....However - I like the color so am keeping it and still giving 5 stars,5,1,2017-4-28,1,2,0
"Bought as a gift for Father's day. My dad absolutely loves it. Great sound and great range. It didn't come with the wall charger so he called Bose and they mailed him one free of charge within 48 hrs. The customer service rep said they get calls all the time for the missing charger. That is strange but, if they send it that fast I think it's no big deal. You can use a phone charger while you wait for it.",5,1,2017-6-30,1,2,0
"There are many terrible aspects to this lemon Bose speaker.  But the two worst are:  1) when it’s charging, it makes a terrible beeping noise INCESSANTLY and 2) the gosh darn thing charges for hours and then only plays for ONE HOUR AT MOST!  It’s truly a horrible purchase!",1,1,2018-5-25,1,2,0
"Bought this when it was deal of the day and under 100$. I do have a Bose soundlink  mini so i was hoping for comparable quality but it does not quite meet that sound standard. If you're looking for full bass sound, look elsewhere.Pros",4,1,2019-10-17,1,4,0
"This is a well built speaker that puts out good sound. Love that it's weather proof. The problem is that a Bose software update adds a ""feature"" (that you can't disable) which has this speaker always looking for previously paired devices using low-energy Bluetooth scanning. After this update, you can push the power button and it looks like the speaker is off, but it's not really off, and as soon as it finds the last phone/tablet/PC you paired it with, it turns itself back on to full power. Annoying as hell and also runs down the battery. It's a well documented problem on Bose forums, but there is no fix in sight. If you're only using this speaker with one device and you don't care that it stays on all the time, I guess it's still a good option, but that's a weird use case for a portable speaker.",1,1,2019-9-12,1,4,0
I am happy with it overall.  A couple random observations to pass forward.1. The white is NOT white.  As another reviewer noted (which I didn't see until I received mine) it grayer but not a cool true grey.  If I'd known I'd have gone with black - it doesn't blend with my decor as well.,4,1,2017-4-12,1,1,0
"This was on sale for Prime day, so I figured why not since Bose has a good reputation and I have some of their products and love them (speakers in my car and two sets of headphones). I did go to my nearby Bestbuy and listen to the soundlink in person (although the limited edition color is amazon exclusive), and it sounded decent enough but it's always hard to get a good feel until you have it at home and can really test it. Well, for $89 on sale this speaker performs as well as my $20-$40 speakers, so I was very underwhelmed and disappointed in this. It is a good speaker, but I know I can get way better for within this price range, especially when the normal price is $130! Maybe some people will really like it, but I strongly urge you to at least try and find a store to test it at before purchasing. Then again, amazon does have a great return policy... (thankfully). Also, as other reviewers stated, be aware it only comes with a usb charging cord.",2,1,2019-8-5,1,2,0
"The first speaker I ordered ""skipped"" as soon as I began to use it. I returned it for another which worked perfectly. However, after two weeks, this one has begun to skip. We can't listen to music--which of course is why we bought the speaker in the first place. Unfortunately, since this replacement appeared to be working just fine, I disposed of the boxes, wrapping, etc...and I'm not sure I can return it. I guess Bose is just not what it used to be back in the ""old days""""After several days of trying to fix this speaker, I am lowering my rating to one star.  I have been trying all the recommended fix: hold the Lazarus (3 dot) button for 15 seconds. Then the power went off and won't come back on no matter what I do. Yes, it is plugged in; yes I pressed Lazarus again. $129 down the drain. DO NOT DISCARD THE BOX/WRAP/ETC when it seems to be working just fine. Wait at least a month or two...because that may be all the time you have with this speaker.",1,1,2018-3-25,1,1,0
"I have owned one of my Bose Color Soundlinks for a minimum of three years. This one I purchased as a birthday gift for my teenage son. They're easy to pair to your phones, Amazon Firestick etc.  The TV in the master bedroom sits along the wall of my teenager's bedroom. So if I watch TV at night, I paired my Bose to my Firestick in my room and place it near my pillow and turn the volume down so it's not disturbing him.For music, you can't beat listening to it through a Bose speaker. My childhood piano teacher went to Julliard for her Master's degree. She ear trained me in music and piano theory at the end of a Steinway concert grand piano. So trust me implicitly when I say that Bose speakers are one of the most perfect devices invented for music. I can also go into the settings on my iPhone and change my music equalizer on my phone to various settings. I love both of our Bose speakers. I wouldn't own any other type. It's the best $129.00 investment.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0
"My Soundlink 2 worked great for a few months and then just stopped charging. I looked it up and realized it was a very common issue. I followed instructions on how to perform a reset to get it charging again which did end up working if I did this repeatedly throughout my time with this more-trouble-than-its-worth speaker. Eventually even resetting it stopped working and I realized that it's new way to charge was by being attached to my laptop and using the bose app to connect. It's such a pain to charge, it's just not worth it. I dont even use my bose speaker anymore. I am a bose junky and usually swear by all their products but I absolutely cannot back this little speaker and would recommend looking elsewhere for a speaker with better charging capabilities.",1,1,2019-12-29,1,2,0
"I am quite surprised with the performance of this speaker. Being a Bose product, I had expected outstanding high quality sound on Bluetooth AND direct line-in connection. What I have found, is that the direct line-in has better quality than Bluetooth. When connected on Bluetooth, the music has that ""fuzz-out"" effect (barely noticeable to the non-musically inclined) like you would get if the treble (high frequency) was turned up to the point that the speakers can't handle it.Not very impressed with this Bose product. I took a chance on it; this speaker was the first brand name Bluetooth speaker I've ever bought.",4,1,2018-1-20,1,5,0
"This speaker did not even last a month. After a few weeks, it stopped holding a charge. We called customer service and they sent us a label to send it back and get a *replacement*. However, they sent back the same machine instead and, surprise, it still had the same problem. When we asked to get a refund, they refused, saying that the 30-day warranty period had finished because they start counting it from - get this - not the purchase date but the manufacture date. It's the second time that we've had a bad experience with Bose, which is supposed to be such a nice brand. They've lost a customer. In the long run, it's cheaper to provide good customer service.

"In an age with off the shelf Natural Voice synthesis WHY has Bose allowed this slurry voice be the audible prompts? Everytime I hear it I edge a little closer to hating the device.  It's that bad.  It's shamefully lazy or excessively beancountified.The clarity of fidelity music played through a wire are a few bits shy of what I would expect from Bose.  Something is missing but I cannot yet characterize it.  Why not the route of Boston Acoustics with their Oontz ""brand"" for inferior lower cost products to preserve integrity of the Trademark?  Yes, playing streaming compressed music over bluetooth degrades quality more. For a wide variety of music types in an outdoor setting this is an acceptable trade for portable convenience.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,4,1
Disappointed with sound.I've been a bose owner of various products for over 10years and this product does not live up to the bose sound. It's no different than a $25 Bluetooth speaker I have already which actually sounds better since that one is stereo and this is mono. Construction is nice but sound is most important and it does not live up to expectations.,2,1,2017-9-19,1,1,0
This might be the worst purchase ever. It is such a pain to charge. You have to use the cord it came with. You can’t use one that fits. So right now I cannot charge this because I cannot find the freaking cord that came with the product because I think the housekeeper organize things and now it’s missing. So I tried all kinds of different chords that fit and I plugged it in and I cannot charge it. So it’s unusable. Do not buy this and less you plan to never detach the cord from it.

"It’s funny that my $60 Bluetooth iPhone I bought 4 years ago never cuts out but this one won’t stop. I’ve only had it a day and I decided it’s not for me. Every time it connects this annoying voice says ""connected to device 57877KLPR.. ""  can’t it just make a pleasant sound to let me know it’s connected? Anyway I decided to order a different speaker and send this back. I need it for a party and I don’t want to risk it cutting out constantly. It says the Bose website to listen to audio but don’t be connect to WiFi to prevent the cutting out. Is that a joke? All my music is accessed through WiFi and yeah I can save some offline but I shouldn’t have to do that! and I plan on using my speaker for streaming tv & movies.

"There are a lot of reviews saying the unit died after awhile. Hoping these aren't true. I find it's very beautifully designed, with a high quality feel and function. Looks great. The sound is excellent with good bass and clear midrange and treble. Has a very good sound stage, not stereo but it sounds broad, much bigger than you'd expect. Very good companion speaker since at low volumes it sounds quite full and present. What I was surprised at is a comparison with the Bose SoundLink Micro which I bought for a friend. The two speakers sound almost identical. The Color 2 does get louder, but not by a lot. And the Micro is much more compact and completely waterproof. Honestly, I'd go with the Micro. For 30 dollars less you get virtually the same speaker, much smaller and waterproof. So much easier to carry around the Micro and it has that great strap to attach it to whatever. Very interesting comparison. But I'll keep this because it does get louder and it does sound excellent. I do wish it played even louder for outside. But you won't be disappointed although the JBL Charger 3 has more bass, gets louder and costs the same. But it isn't as svelt as this (it's significantly larger and tube shaped) and the midrange/highs don't sound as good. Check them out at Best Buy. I gave the Micro 5 stars but the Color 2 has 4 for not being very much better and more expensive.",4,1,2018-3-16,1,2,0

I was afraid to spend so much on a Bluetooth speaker, but sooo worth it!! Very happy I did!UPDATE: I've always been so impressed with bose! Obviously. ..^^ It was my understanding they never blew up! My bluetooth now rattles as if it's blown.  I am so sad!  :-( I don't even listen to it anymore I'm so embarrassed and surprised! It wasn't inexpensive either.  But apparently cheap.

"I use this speaker almost daily. The music sounds great, and my podcasts have a nice clean sound too. This is super easy to use - my phone synced almost instantly on setup. I will say that once the battery warning says it's on medium, it isn't very long before it runs out altogether. I'd say I easily get the reported hours of battery life promised, but it does seem odd that medium doesn't truly seem to indicate it's in the middle of its battery life. I just know now to start charging it as soon as I hear that little alert. No biggie.",5,1,2017-8-19,1,2,0
"This is a nice speaker when it works. Unfortunately, if the battery drains getting it to work again can be an extremely frustrating, time consuming challenge.  None of the quickly viewed results to fix the issue worked for me. Eventually I found the answer buried in a YouTube video comment.  Seems like there are several different 'fixes' out there, so finding the one that works for you is very frustrating.  To fix mine, I had to plug the speaker into my computer, open the BOSE updater app on my computer, press and hold the 'a,s,d, up-arrow, down-arrow keys' at the same time until the power light on the speaker started blinking. I left the speaker plugged into my computer to charge. Once charged, I had to pair and reboot my computer.Bose calls this bug a 'feature'. Supposedly  when the speaker won't turn on it's because it's in sleep mode to protect the battery and extend it's life. This isn't a ""feature""; it's a bug.  You should be able to plug the speaker in and it charges - period.  Other videos say the problem is caused by not having the software updated or not using the BOSE charger that comes with the speaker. My problem wasn't cause by either of these. I hadn't used the speaker in a while, the battery drained and I couldn't get it out of sleep mode. Will not buy another BOSE product based on this experience.",1,1,2019-1-6,1,1,0
"Bose has always been a great name in small speakers. I am sorry to say this but Bose really missed the mark on the soundlink speaker II. First, the speakers are designed to travel but they have no handel to carry them with or hang them with wherever you decide to use them. Second, good chance you will use these speakers at night. The buttons on the top used to control the speakers cannot be felt to tell what they are in the dark. I have a Fugoo speaker and you can run it without light just by feel. Third, sitting up to pair 2 speakers together in stereo was not well explained. I am not sure but once the speakers are paired they don’t stay that way and have to be messed with every time you use them. What a hassle! The Fugoo I have is better but doesn’t pair to do stereo.

"After going into a Bose store while on vacation, I came across this portable bluetooth speaker. It has amazing sound quality for its size and is very durable. I bring this to the pool, on my patio, in the driveway, literally anywhere I go. It's made of a rubberized material and very compact and travel-sized. This is a water resistant speaker, NOT water proof so make sure you don't submerge it under water or in anything else. The sound quality is loud, crisp, and clear. Connects very easily to not only my bluetooth phone but also my laptop. The battery lasts around 6-8 hours and charges pretty quickly.",5,1,2018-1-22,1,1,1

The sound is amazing! It gets pretty loud with out being distorted. The only thing that bothered me was the batter life. I charge it from dead to fully charged and I can hardly use it for 3 hours before it dies again. I am only using it to listen to my books on cd while cleaning so its not like I am asking to much from it.

"I’m not an audiophile by any means. This is just my opinion as a music lover. The sound quality of the music itself on this is great as is expected with Bose. The volume capability is pathetic. Especially for a Bose. Max volume is disappointing. And the battery life is not great either; it states that it’ll run for 8 hours at HALF VOLUME... however, half volume is so quiet that it isn’t even an acceptable listening volume. I was super stoked to get it on Prime Day for a good deal... I ended up returning it within 2 weeks and 3 different listening experiences.

I wanted a speaker for my computer, that would let me take it into the kitchen or wherever if I chose to.However as a regular speaker (hooked into say AUX and AC power), it's a bit questionable.

I used it at a jog-a-thon-type event at the school at which I work, and even with over 100 students cheering and participating, you could still hear the music.  I imagine it would be more than adequate for a smaller gathering like a pool or house party, or camping.  The free Bose app that is optional to use is very handy.  I never have trouble connecting the speaker to my phone via Bluetooth.  My only complaint is that the battery life seems to be only about 3-4 hours, and I wish it were a little longer.  But otherwise, I LOVE this little speaker.  It's so tough, too.

I had it plugged in for two days only to find out there was zero charge. When it has been actually charging for some time, the voice says something unintelligible that sounds like ""battery pie"". It has never said ""battery full"" at any point. There is no row of illuminated dots or digital screen showing the amount of charge like on pretty much every other wireless device ever made. But I could just run it while it's plugged in, right? Nope. If it is not charged, it won't run even when plugged in.

Have to keep the volume much lower than I would like, which is quite low, to tolerate.  Often can't even hear the treble sounds in a normal way. I've had this for over a year, and only recently have been using it a lot.  Quite annoying not to have a way to adjust.  Listening to Pandora and YouTube with it. Otherwise the speaker is great.

"1) This speaker will not control the volume as you would expect it to do. When linked to a stereo sound system (a new Yamaha RX-V383)  using Bluetooth, the volume controls on speaker do not work, and the volume is low. Using an iPhone, it controls the volume by controlling the volume slider on the phone, not changing the volume of the speaker itself. We were told by Bose that the unit was only meant to be used with a phone and was not compatible with our home sound system. There is no indication of this behavior anywhere on-line, so we are returning it.2) The sound quality was not what we expected.

Saves the battery from going dead when you forget to turn it off. However it will not turn back on unless you connect it to the power cord for even half a second. Then it will work fine on battery again. I called the Bose technical support, they are aware of this issue. Their fix is to turn off the automatic shut-off or always keep a power cord handy. This is not what I expect from Bose! I would have given it one star but it does sound great!

I didn't keep packaging and my time is worth more than it would take to contact their support over a $100 speaker.In general, it doesn't surprise me. The speaker seemed over-engineered (thus, overly complicated and prone to problems and frustration). For example, it tries to speak in many languages. But not only can you not understand what it's saying, it's just annoying and more complicated than it should be.

I tried many different ways and adjusted the volumes as well, but the iPhone X speaker was always superior to using the Bose for a conference call.I did not use it as a speaker, so I cannot speak to its use as a speaker. I have had Bose speakers in the past (I still have a Bose Bluetooth speaker) and they have been great for listening to music. However, this item does a terrible job as a conference call speaker.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,2,0
"I have to update my review of this: I loved it when I first got it, and the sound quality is still great, but after a couple months it began randomly shutting off and it wouldn't turn back on until it was plugged into a power supply again. This wasn't an issue of needing to be charged - most of the time I would plug it in, and it would have full or medium battery charge and it would just randomly shut off in the middle of being used. I've had it less than a year, and it won't charge. I tried several different cables to charge it, and then tested those cables with other devices and the cables are able to charge other things, but the speaker itself won't charge. This speaker has never been dropped or been around water, it just sits on my kitchen counter or my TV stand, so it's not a matter of damage either.I'll be contacting Bose to see if they can replace it.",2,1,2018-1-29,1,4,0
"Return window closed on 8/16/19 and on 8/18/19, the speaker completely stopped playing any sound out of it except it's own voice.  I tried to connect multiple devices which had no issue with the speaker before and they too would not play any sound from the speaker.  I tried different music services and still no sound.  This is a BAD PRODUCT.  Example:  I tried to connect to the unit from my bedroom this morning and it would not play the music - it said it was connected and turned on but the music kept coming out of the music device and not the new Bose speaker so since it said the charge was low, I plugged it into the charger.  Still it would connect and NOT play music.  I unpaired it, tried it with another device and through at least 7 attempts of all of those options the music never once played out of the speaker.  I turned it off.  Then decided to try something else 20 minutes later and when I turned on the device, which was completely charged when I turned it on, it said it had a medium charge.  So, it was turned off with a full charge and 20 minutes later the charge went to medium with no explanation at all.  DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE it is defective.",1,1,2019-8-18,1,2,0
"The battery does not last long at all!  I'm constantly having to charge, very annoying.  It will connect with my phone and my husband's phone automatically, unless one of us turns off our Bluetooth completely.  If we are both connected, and I'm listening to music, anything he does on his phone interferes and makes the Bose cut out.  Every single day I have to text him to turn off his Bluetooth.  It's really quite annoying also.  If I were to purchase another portable, Bluetooth speaker, it wouldn't be this one.  I want to love it, these two issues are just irritating.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
"I like the speaker, it is very nice. The interface and bluetooth. they are from another planet. This device will sync with 2 devices, so I connected it to my laptop and my cell. Here is where it gets annoying. The speaker is in my laptop bag, i power up my laptop, and shortly after i hear the speaker turn on, state its battery life and that it is now connected to my laptop.  I open my bag, press the power switch and it turns off. 10 seconds later, it powers on again, states its battery life and that it is connected to my laptop. This will continue forever. I expect much better from Bose.In the video, I have just powered the speaker down, and started the video, you will not less than 10 seconds it will power up and connect.",3,1,2019-8-9,1,1,0
"When it arrived it wouldn’t take a charge. I sent it back to Bose. When I got it back it took a charge, but battery life was never longer than 3 hours. I have had it for about a year and a half now. The battery life is down to around an hour.The sound quality is decent. Not any better than the $50 speakers out there. Certainly not what I expected from Bose.",1,1,2018-10-17,1,5,0
We have 3 of the original ones: Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker and when our daughter headed to college she took her little brother's with her so we ordered a replacement for him not realizing that this was an upgraded (and even better model). The bass sound is really impressive and the overall sound is very clear. Never choppy or statically despite it being a bluetooth connect. Device has a wired connection too which is great to connect to a laptop for videos / video games.  Didn't add a picture this time since it looks exactly as advertised.,5,1,2018-8-26,1,5,0
"I own a lot of Bose stuff, and I was excited about these speakers.  The sound quality is excellent, but after playing for a while the music starts to break up and skip.  I contacted Bose support and they said to download a newer software revision.  I did that and the problem might have even been worse, but maybe the same.  My phone works fine with other blue tooth systems, including another Bose wireless speaker.  I also tried with my IPOD w/ blue tooth, and had similar problems.  I would like to own these speakers, but they are very frustrating.  I am sending them back.",2,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
"Edit: 11/18/19 - so, this speaker only lasted a year and 7 months. This means it's out of warranty and I feel like I wasted my money.  I thought Bose is quality product but I guess they don't last.Also, I noticed that the battery life is pretty bad on these speakers. After about 3 months into using it and it progressively gets worse. Before it won't charge completely, it stopped playing sound. Dont buy it if you want something that last.",1,1,2018-4-27,1,3,0
"Listen the pictures show it clearly soaked in water droplets. So I bought this for a float trip. I did not submerge it under water but it did get a LITTLE water on it. Well after my float trip it stopped working. Yeah the $129 that I spent on speakers that I thought would be well worth it? Not so much. This is a garbage product. I liked Bose because they are so well known for their sound. My brother has a JBL and that actually is water resistant. That too was brought on our float trip, became a little wet and look it still works to this day. That float trip was over two years ago! I'd go with JBL. Bose doesn't seem to know how to make a water resistant Bluetooth speaker.",1,1,2019-8-12,1,2,0
"The device arrived as promised and the Bluetooth connectivity was easy. The enclosed instructions are sparse, so be prepared to search the Internet to learn more about speaker functions.

"bought this Bluetooth sound system for my husband because he is a long haul truck driver out 18 days at a time and watches shows and movies on his tablet while in his truck. After 11 years of trying many different sound systems they were always too soft. I tried this and he is in love with it, it is as though he is in the movie theater. It is so awsome that I went out and got one for the house, and yes I love to crank up the sound to the fullest so I drown out any other noises. It is portable so I can take it anywhere I want, including the yard, my car, the beach. I can also play it in one room and have it loud and clear in another room. It might not be a surround sound but it is just as great and is worth every penny! It would be a great present for anyone any age.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,1,0
"I've had this product for less than 2 years and it will no longer turn on. The last time I put it away I made sure to fully charge it and I really only use it occasionally.I've gone through all the troubleshooting steps that I've found online and even contacted Bose support. The only option is to pay $75 bucks for a replacement and I'm not going to pay again to replace a defective product. There are many many posts online with similar complaints if you look up ""Bose Soundlink won't turn on"".",1,1,2019-5-15,1,3,0
"GF bought me one of these for a gift. I used in in the tub connected to my phone. I was surprised at the overall sound quality at reasonable ""bath time"" volume levels. After a few soaks, I decided I liked it enough to get another one and thus be able to listen to the pair in stereo.That's where most of the trouble begins.  There is a specific way that you have to connect the speakers to achieve a stereo pair.  And about 1/4 to 1/3 of the time.. it simply doesn't work. It will look for the other speaker, a mere 3 feet from the first one, and never find it forcing you to begin the routine again and again and hope that it eventually works.  Or worse, it will find the other speaker and lose connection with the first one. In these times the first speaker actually appears to be completely dead and non-responsive and you are forced to go plug it into it's USB charging cable in order to wake it up again.",3,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I purchased this speaker in March of 2017.  When I received it, I was so impressed with it and loved it.  The speaker has great sound for a small speaker.  About six months later it stopped working.  I called Bose and they sent me another speaker.  Good customer service. Fast forward to June of 2019 and the speaker stopped working AGAIN.  I called Bose expecting that great customer service they gave me last time and was told it was no longer under warranty.  Bad warranty! They offered me a discount to BUY another speaker.  Why would I buy another speaker when I know it won't last??  Don't buy this speaker unless you believe that $129 ever year is a good deal. They obviously have had lots of trouble with this speaker because my friend had the same problem.",1,1,2019-5-22,1,4,0
This was a great product when it was new. Exceptional sound. Very good Bluetooth connectivity and range. Acceptable battery life.At almost exactly four months it is simply stopped working no lights no sound no nothing.,1,1,2019-10-29,1,2,0
"This is my first portable speaker and I'm not a sound/speaker expert.  I can use the speaker while charging it, which is great because sometimes I need it to last more than 8 hours.  Works well with with auxiliary input and Bluetooth.  I did not download the Bose Connect app and not planning on downloading it unless the app has equalizer.  The only thing that I'm not too crazy about is that it has a bit too much base.  Normally, in my car, I usually adjust my speakers to get more base but somehow this speaker just has a bit too much base for my taste.It's light enough, 1.5 lbs.  So far, dust doesn't clink to the speaker as I fear because of the silicone cover, but the base of the speaker traps dirt/hair that I can't seem to get it off using just my fingers.  I'm not too worry, probably a wet towel would clean that up.",4,1,2019-7-24,1,1,0
"We absolutely love Bose sound and have had our Bose radio, which we have other devices jacked into, since 1997 and it still looks and sounds fantastic. We've purchased other portable speakers/docks for outside use but never with the same results Bose provides, so we decided to grab this one to use by the pool.Hallelujah! What a spectacular purchase! Everyone in the family has sinced to it easily, the sound is crystal clear inside and out, charge lasts and lasts, and I even use it at school events as a teacher to play sound effects or mood music  It's compact size is just perfect for traveling but don't let the size fool you. It's a powerhouse.",5,1,2017-11-11,1,6,0
"I use my Soundlink in the kitchen.  Face it out of a corner for the best bass response.  I have learned a few things about this speaker the past 12 months.  It is very sensitive to the number of Amps your power block and cable can provide.  I used to just grab a charger that was close by, but I learned quickly not all power blocks and cables are the same.  Use a 2.1 Amp or 2.4 Amp block and be sure to use a USB 2.0 Fast Charge cable to get the best results.  A lower Amp block or cheap cable and you may not get the assuring ""beep"" when you plug it in to charge.  The lower amps will also cause it to charge a lot longer.  Fire TV stick or Roku power blocks do not provide enough juice.  Phone chargers will not either unless they are ""Fast Chargers"".  Kind of sad that for the price Bose does not include a proper set up like the JBL speakers so that customers do not have issues.  This is my reason for dropping a star.",4,1,2019-7-19,1,1,0
"I've been using this little speaker intermittently for the last 3.5 years.  I was pretty happy with it.  not a care in the world.  Then, the day after exhausting the battery, it won't charge.  At all.  As though it's not plugged in. Of course, first I blame myself; I tried a different outlet, a different charger. I ran through all the troubleshooting nonsense.  nopey nope. dead. got on the bose site and was told I was out of luck, they'd be happy to give me a discount on another one.  And why would I do that?  I'm holding a perfectly functioning UE Boom in my hand that's survived happily for the last 5 years.  And it was/is cheaper than the ""discount"" price Bose offered.  so that's a hard pass, Bose.  I've learned my lesson.",2,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"I have the the original Bose Soundtouch Bluetooth Speaker, the Soundtouch II only works with smart devices with volume controls. If used with a device like an XM radio (dumb device) with an external Bluetooth transmitted it will connect but only at full volume.

Support was very poor took two weeks, three phone calls and two emails to identify design fault.",1,1,2019-8-16,1,3,0
"Great sound, battery, connects to damn near everything-- All of that is great.The issue is that it's *thirsty* for attention.

"This speaker has an annoying ""feature"" that caused me to rate this two stars. When connected to a power source, and, with the Auto-Off feature disabled, the speaker still shuts off at low volume levels. You can't listen to classical music or jazz at low volumes without it shutting down. When this happens, raising the volume level on the source causes it to come back on at blaring volume levels. I contacted Bose about this but they sent me an unhelpful pro-forma email describing how to turn the Auto-Off feature on and off. They ignore the fact the speaker shouldn't be shutting off at all when connected to a power source. I found this behavior so annoying that I sold it on eBay at a loss. I give it two stars because it's a quality product albeit one with too much bass.",2,1,2017-10-23,1,1,0
"I ordered the Bose sound link 2 speaker. After about eight months of use, it started having issues with pairing. The battery would also frequently die even though it had hardly been used and was just charged.  I tried numerous times to connect with Bose, this was an expensive product. There is no customer service or opportunity for repair. Just an offer to buy another one at $75!

"This thing was nice when it worked. There were times when the bluetooth would freak out and give me a hard time. Battery life was meh.

Which it did...for 4 months. Well almost 4 months. The battery just died and never charged ever again. too bad really. This was a nice speaker. As of right now though if you're looking at this i suggest you look elsewhere.",1,1,2019-11-10,1,2,0
Bought this speaker as a gift for my girlfriend.  The speaker was working great until we let the battery completely die at her house this weekend. Now the speaker will not charge.  The return window ended for the speaker 2 days before this issue so now we are stuck with a $100 Bose paperweight.  Disappointed that Bose's quality has become this poor and Amazon is selling this speaker even though this issue apparently is common if you search online.,1,1,2020-9-7,1,2,0
Was a good speaker but died just outside of the warranty.  Had the same thing happen to Bose soundlink mini.  Will never buy another Bose product.  Good sound but just doesn’t last long.  I’ve gotten more life out of Bluetooth speakers I got for free at trade shows.,1,1,2019-8-16,1,4,0
While it lasted the Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II was an awesome speaker.  However over time after plugging and unplugging after so many times the port that you actually plug into goes bad and you can't charge or even plug and play anymore.  This is now a known issue on these and also the Bose SoundLink Micro which I have also ordered.  Although at this time the Bose SoundLink Micro haven't had the issue yet.  Perhaps because I haven't used it as much. Everything is perfect with this except for the issue I mentioned.,1,1,2020-9-10,1,2,0
"I'm sending it back because it's not my taste, but it's actually a pretty good speaker.  It doesn't distort, it can go very loud, it's easy to move around.  The reasons I'm sending it back are:1) It has that ""one speaker"" sound, the sound comes from a very isolated area.  This may be because it's a more vertical orientation.  The replacement speaker i got has a horizontal orientation and produces sound that, even though the volume is about the same as the Bose, it's a broader sound, more like you would get from a boom box. It sounds more natural to me than the Bose.",3,1,2019-1-13,1,1,0
"This is my third Bose Bluetooth speaker.  Still have the Soundlink Mini which still works although replacement batteries are not made any longer.  For the Soundlink Color, I like the size and shape of the product.  The sound is very good, however the battery is a hindrance.  I’ve only had a few hours of sound before it gives an audible “battery is low” and shuts off.  The Soundlink Mini had much better battery life.  The other thing I don’t like is that they added voice connection info which plays every time you turn it on.  So, when I’m ready to switch from phone to speaker, the music stops while the speaker says  “Battery is medium, connected to Dad’s iPhone...” and then the music starts.  I liked the Mini which just played a distinct beep when it connected and there was less of a break in the music.  There are a couple symbols on top that are not easily identified as to their purpose.  I’d prefer some text in English instead.  In the effort to make a global product, you lose clear communication.  I included photos of the top of the Color speaker and the older Mini.",3,1,2019-8-27,1,0,1
"Overall, I love these speakers. Sound is great. My biggest issue is with the set-up instructions.  Took the instructions out of the box, followed the following instructions:1.

"Love this speaker! I've had it for a couple years now and it's the best speaker I've ever owned. I was hesitant to spend so much on a speaker since I never really owned one but this was a great choice! I love how portable it is. Battery lasts a long time (I use it heavily on a daily basis) and the durability over all is great. I've dropped it, spilled water on it, it fell into a chlorinated pool (TWICE!!!!) and it still works like new and I haven't had any problems with it. Always connects to whatever device I am using and setup is easy. Highly recommend this speaker",5,1,2019-4-30,1,3,1
"I couldn’t be more dissatisfied with this purchase. It turns on randomly, beeps uncontrollably, turns off randomly when the battery is medium or even high. Sometimes it gets staticky and other times It’s fine, even at the exact same distance from the computer it’s connected to. The worst part is the beeping. All the time while it charges.

I've been wanting a high-quality speaker for years, and finally caved and dropped the money on this one. I've only owned it for the day, but it functions perfectly so far and is much louder than the ones I'm used to, and the sound quality is insanely better as well, which is exactly what I was after when I decided to drop over a hundred dollars on a portable speaker lol. I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a solid portable Bluetooth speaker with big and quality sound. I'm also really impressed with the bass.

"...however, for only $100, this particular Bose product isn't overpriced, like most of this other stuff.  I own the previous generation of this unit, and I can tell you this new model is quite a cut above.  The only nit I have is that Bose still uses these unresponsive, squishy buttons that leave the user wondering if anything has happened when they are pressed.The unit could also use a small LED display to let Bluetooth users know how much volume is resident when engaged.  Why?  Well, the vast majority of devices that connect to a powered Bluetooth speaker are Bluetooth *themselves*, so when the volume isn't what you expect it to be, users need to be able to set levels on *both* connected devices to set desired sound levels.  On the Bose, however, users have to keep pushing squishy buttons up and down and guess if they're having any effect.",4,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"I never write reviews but now with time on my hands and knowing people are at home possibly upgrading their home entertainment systems, the short version is: DO NOT ORDER THIS.It constantly cuts out and I know this is not due to an internet issue. These issues occur whether I'm streaming Spotify, iTunes, or my favorite radio station (s/o to KEXP.ORG).  I also have to disconnect and reconnect it because when it's on and I'm on a Zoom call (like we all are lately), the sound is terrible and echo-y according to others on the Zoom.

"I have one of these speakers and I absolutely love it.  So while we were at our Father's Day celebration this year, my dad mentioned that he takes the old old radio we had in our bathroom from the house I grew up in outside to listen to his talk radio (I'm not lying to say the radio he uses is 30-35 years old).  He also mentioned he loves using his iPad to play easy listening music on his other speaker but using that speaker means he needs to stay inside because it's not portable.  Hearing this, my wife and I looked at each other and said we need to get him this Bose speaker.  He can ditch the radio and listen to his easy listening music on his back porch and enjoy the weather.  I took it up to him, showed him how to use it.  I had to explain a few times how he can select an app on his iPad and listen to it on the speaker but he got it.  The next day I got a text saying how it was so peaceful and nice to sit on his back porch and listen to Elvis on his speaker.  My parents have a lot going on health wise and to hear my dad say how happy and relaxed he was listening to Elvis while sitting outside made my heart full.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

"I would have given it 4 stars if it were half the price that it is. The sound quality is not what I would expect from Bose. Since you cannot adjust treble/mids/bass, you are stuck with the standard sound and can only adjust via whatever music source you are using. The battery life has dwindled down to about 45 minutes at this point. It is not very loud but it can get the job done for a few rooms indoors. Outdoors, it gets easily drowned out by my neighbors' music in the yard next door.

Don’t let it completely die because it’ll take forever to know if the charger is making contact...it’s like dealing with a 5+ year old iPhone except only 3 weeks into owning it. Doesn’t have the bass quality of the original soundlink either",2,1,2020-7-23,1,3,0
"A friend had this in FL and I was really impressed it sounded so well outside. I took my delivery today and it paired instantly, using the Bose app, to my Moto G Play. The sound is a little too bassie for me but the sound quality is still good. I have not tried battery life yet (I'm plugged in) but will update later. I was hesitant because of so many poor reviews that were from 2016-2018. The recent reviews were much more positive so I took a chance. I just can't believe a Brand as iconic as BOSE would mess with their rep selling trashy cheap speaker ( price is relative , my other cheap apt Bose system was like $700). Anyway I will update. If this works well for only 2 years I would still consider it a worthwhile item. Of course we spend a lot of time camping so it will see some heavy use.",4,1,2019-5-8,1,2,0
"I give this somewhere between 3/3.5 Stars.I love the portability of it. There are some nice features, like the remaining battery level announced when turning it on. The sound is good, though not as great as I expected (the quality is fine, it just seems as though I have to turn it up very high in order to really hear it if I'm not right on top of the speaker).",3,1,2019-7-24,1,2,0
"I have an older soundlink, loved it but the battery life degraded after years of use. I ordered a Soundlink Revolve as a replacement. Volume control buttons don't work in Bluetooth mode! Spent hours in chat and on the phone to both Amazon and Bose, they all acted like they never heard of the problem before and recommended I send it back and get a replacement, Amazon replaced it in one day "" Great Service""! Same problem!! I returned it. I've been happy with Bose products over the years, so I decide to order a copy of the original Soundlink that I like, Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II - Soft black. Same problem, %$^7*&*^&%^$! I returned it and ordered JBL, should have it tomorrow.",1,1,2020-1-25,1,2,0
"It didn't work when I got it. I had to drive over an hour to a Bose store to get it fixed. At the store I found out that the speaker was sent to me with out of date firmware. The person at the store fixed the speaker and it worked for a few months, although people complained about the sound quality when I used it as a microphone on Zoom. However, it suddenly stopped working a couple of months ago whenever I connected it with my Mac laptop. It connects for about 10 seconds and then disconnects. I called Bose customer service and was told it wasn't their fault, it was Apple's. This despite quite a few customer complaints about this problem on the web  and the fact that I have never had a problem with any other bluetooth device that I have used with my laptop. Their Mac firmware update program also does not work. It won't even open.",1,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"Otherwise nice speaker has an unacceptable glitch that caused me to return it. The speaker will detect a previously paired bluetooth source and turn itself on, whether you want it on or not (i.e. the on/off switch will not turn it off more than a few seconds until it detects the signal and turns itself back on). Per Bose support, this is a normal feature that can't be turned off. This issue is discussed in the Bose community blog, but for some reason, Bose is ignoring it.  To work around this ""feature"", each time you use it , you must either a) go to the bluetooth source device and turn off bluetooth (making it impossble to use the source for another device, e.g. headphones), or b) erase the speaker's memory of previous pairing, adding a step to turn it off, and then it must be paired again when you turn it on, requiring the additional re-pairing step. Maybe in some cases this feature is good, but in my case, the speaker is in my shower and the source is in another room, so each time I want to use the speaker, I have to retrieve it, take it to the other room, then re-pair it and return to the shower, instead of being able to just ""power on"".",1,1,2018-12-18,1,3,0
"I bought my first one a year ago to play on our patio. It worked great for the summer season. When I pulled it out to play this spring, it would not charge. I tried to update the unit per recommendations online. No help.We really liked the speaker, so I bought a second one.  We used it for about a month and again the ability to charge has failed.",1,1,2020-6-3,1,2,0

"This portable speaker is cosmetically well made. The sound is very good. There seems to be problems with the controls. After fully charging the unit, it would not come on by pressing the control buttons. After fully charged, I would need to plug in the cable to make it operate as it normally should......This is after a full charge. I never left it plugged in continually, but only till the indicator light was green. I have seen postings of the like as my post. There may be some control button issues or internal issues. I have read a post, identical to my post when even after charging, you need to plug in the cable to get it to perform. I have always used the original cable.",2,1,2019-6-30,1,1,0
"Again, for the reviewers saying these are failing or ""bricking"" on the firmware update (they always do.  I'm now three for three seeing this).  Yes its' a bug and they all do it.  Connect them to the USB port on a computer instead of just a power supply.  They may need to sit for some time.  Hold down the button with three dots for 10-15 seconds.  Try doing so leaving the USB connected or disconnect while holding the button.  Part of the problem seems to be if the battery gets run down too far.  Or the power supply used provides too little power.  It sucks but the point is, it hasn't failed and will wake.Original Review:",4,1,2018-5-2,1,8,0
"This speaker did not live up to the reputation associated with the Bose brand.  First off, it would not charge quickly- and would lose charge extremely quickly.  In fact, there were problems charging this speaker despite every single trouble-shooting procedure outlined online and in videos.  After 2 days of futile attempts, it was time to send it back.  I have since bought a JVC Bluetooth speaker which is terrific in every regard - and even cost a bit less.",1,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"For a portable speaker sound is strong and clear true to the Bose name. Material is a plastic covering that helps it from not slipping off the hands or countertop...however mine quit streaming music although connected and after trouble shooting with Bose customer service a second time, Bose themselves determined it defective.

Love it so much!!",3,1,2018-12-14,1,2,0
"I bought several Bose speakers and headphones as gifts in the past. I did buy Bose headphones for me and very happy with them. But as speakers I felt they were a little overpriced and over rated. Then I decided to get these to be used while traveling. In summary I am very impressed with the sound (amazing). They added a rubber texture to these new models and they improved the handling of them. I have professional speaker monitors at home for listening but these sound natural, flat response (no artificial bass or treble boost) and room fulling perfect for travel companion. I do not know how Bose does it but I cannot believe the sound you get from such a small unit. They are well worth every penny.",5,1,2017-8-10,1,3,0
"I bought this speaker to use for calls while working remotely, and for the sound quality.  I know of their reputation for good sound quality, and in that regard, it did not disappoint.  The Bluetooth connection, however, is not always consistent, and I have to keep on selecting it as an option whenever I make a call, even though it acknowledges that it is connected to my iPhone.  I am a little disappointed that i have to do this since I have an off-brand, small speaker that though it lacks in sound quality, at least consistently kept the Bluetooth connection.I would recommend it primarily for the rich, sound quality, but not so much if you are bothered by having to remind it that is needs to maintain Bluetooth connectivity.",4,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"The speaker sounds great, but the battery was low the other day and I charged it for some hours now.  The battery isn't charging or showing a light indicating that it is charging.

"I got this speaker for a few reasons.First, the voice prompts because I’m blind. They could still use a bit of work, but Bose is definitely what the visually impaired should use.  I know that they bother some people, but they can easily be disabled via the Bose Connect app.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Speaker sounds great and looks great. The volume adjustment (on the speaker) stopped working. I must use the device from which I am streaming in order to adjust the volume. My phone, for example, is not always beside me, especially when I'm in the pool. So, adjusting the volume become a task... get out of the pool, find my phone, turn the volume up/down. The speaker is great otherwise. Great sound, loud volume when needed and looks great.Wish I could figure out how to fix the volume issue. I have googled the issue and none of the suggestions have helped yet.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"The speaker has stopped working after 2 months of less than daily use. My husband plays a song or two in the evening. Now we are stuck with this speaker that doesn't work and at $100. I expected it to last longer than that. And you were suppose to be able to connect it to another Bose speaker for the ""party mode"", that NEVER worked.

The first time I used it and the song with the water dripping and flowing had my students wondering if I brought in some water feature because it sounded so authentic!!! It made me have to use the bathroom, so I agree it sounds like you are right next to the stream! I get comments all the time about how great the sound is. The battery can only go about 2 hours which is a bummer but now that I know that I find a place with a plug. It does charge fast. I bought a case and I think that is key to keeping it nice.",5,1,2018-12-16,1,1,0
Poor results using with app and multiple devices. After using device for months we regret buying this product.Not sure if Bose is struggling with the app or if the physical device is causing connection and syncing problems.,2,1,2019-1-10,1,2,0
"Awesome product!  I love how easy it is to connect to my phone, how portable it is, and how good the sound is.  Perfect for a small house or apartment where you don't want to overpower your neighbors with sound, but still want to enjoy high quality sound for your music.  I also like the party mode where you can pair two together, although you will need the app for that.  I strongly prefer the bluetooth connection to other brand speakers that require wi-fi.  Battery life is as advertised, and it charges pretty quickly and can play while plugged in which is nice.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,1,0
"I love Bose. I've owned speakers, my vehicle is a Bose system... but this speaker sounded no different than my Oontz Angle for a 1/4 of the price.

"Bluetooth issue, I spoke with Bose 2x and my computer manufacture (HP)  three times.  When ever play anything through my brand new 2017 HP ENVY laptop, music/radio sound  would stop for about 1/2 second and then resume. Downloaded all new and correct drivers and still had same issue.  If played through iPhone, no issue, worked great but wanted to play music through laptop at work.  If I played through AUX in, no issues.  Tech at HP told me had similar issue with similar product, (not Bose) and just kept moving Bluetooth device around room until it stopped.  I'm not going to do that.  Stated it is just an issue with Bluetooth connectivity, just drops periodically.  Disappointed because sound was great.",2,1,2018-1-17,1,3,0
"Well I read the reviews about the poor battery conditions on this product. So I called Bose prior to purchasing it. Of course, I was told the battery issue had been corrected. So I bought it. One month later, it doesn’t work at all. Amazon was great and is going to send me a replacement. We’ll see what happens. Bose, whom I always thought was a quality company (when the speaker worked, it was great) should be more upfront about the battery, including a recall of older product.",2,1,2018-4-4,1,4,0
"Great speaker when it is playing music, but there are a couple quirks that make it infuriating to own. First and foremost, it just turns off sometimes. It doesn't matter what the battery level is or what I'm doing with it, it will just turn off and not turn back on unless I plug it in. I always assume problems like this are just bad luck on my part and that I got a faulty item, but one of friends purchased the same speaker and his turns off and becomes unresponsive as well. The other issue I have, although not on the same scale as the last issue, is the built in voice speaking during use. If you are listening to music and another device connects, it stops the music to let you know another device that was once paired has connected, or disconnected, every time. Again, the sound quality is great, but the product does not live up to the standards I expect from Bose.",2,1,2018-6-14,1,3,0

The volume wouldn't turn down.  I turned it off.  Turned it back on, it wouldn't connect to Alexa.  Sigh.  What a piece of crap.  And it ISN'T RETURNABLE.  DO NOT BUY THIS.",1,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0

We've used it all weekend out by the fire pit. It's perfect. it gets LOUD and has a nice deep bass. It's perfect for outdoors. We compared it to a couple of other speakers we had and this one was far and away a superior product. It's a slim sleek design so it's easy to ""hide"" if you want to keep it out of sight.

"I am someone that appreciates sound quality and prioritizes it with any speaker/system I am playing music on. I wanted to find a waterproof/splashproof bluetooth speaker in the $100 range, and chose Bose as I always had good experiences with the name. This speaker’s sound quality is terrible. I dont expect too much from a portable speaker this size, but I have a sony speaker that is years old and half the price and it sounds much better in comparison. I generally do not go out of my way to write reviews, but as someone that needed good sound quality this did not come close to satisfying.The JBL Charge 4 is the same price, I would recommend that.",1,1,2020-6-27,1,2,0

I got it on Prime day for a nice discount and had no trouble pairing it to my phone. The sound is of course great for the size of the speaker and connectivity is up to Bose quality. The only downsides are battery related. My other Bose speaker gives me a percentage where as this one is just a “high,medium,low”. I have no idea what to do with that. Also the battery doesn’t seem to last when not in use. Over a month with only about once a week use for an hour at a time, the battery went from “high” to “low”.

This is the second Bose Bluetooth speaker I have purchased from Amazon. Same problem again. The sound is amazing but they have this tiny tiny connector on the side of the speaker to charge it. That’s why I returned the first speaker. I bought another one thinking well “ maybe it’s. Me”. Well I don’t use it a lot but I had 4 of my friends try to plug the charger in and NONE of them could do it.Just a shame because I always thought Bose speakers were the best quality. So now it’s past the return date so I guess I have to throw it in the garbage. It’s a shame. Now I lost out on the money and don’t know what brand to get.,1,1,2020-4-13,1,2,0

My recommendation... stay away and go to JBL. I also have a JBL Charge 3. Yes, it is bigger and heavier, but the sound is great and there are NO issues charging. So Bose... I'm very disappointed. Nothing else matters if the speaker can't be charged.",1,1,2019-7-23,1,1,0

I am a little disappointed with the volume limits on this unit. great sound quality as Bose is known for but it just does not go loud enough. I purchased to replace my Harmon Kardon for portability reasons but it doesn't quite make it's match.  Overall it is good for small areas and serves it's purpose, but not exactly a party radio with big crowds. the sound will be drowned out.

Perfect for the deck or tinkering in the garage.  I bring it room to room if I’m listing to Audible and cleaning.  Music sounds decent, way better than similar sized speakers for $20-$75.  I bought it on Prime Day and I wish I had bought a couple more.  I think I only paid $80.  I have had it for a few months and no issues.  Sound is crisp and clear and even he’s decent base (not hardcore thumping but solid) when playing music.

I also was able to connect with my Alexa, so when we ask her to play music it sounds so much better than her built in speaker. I may buy a second one and hook them together in stereo mode for another added touch.",5,1,2019-8-19,1,1,0
I am a Bose fan and the Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II did not disappoint. I purchased it primarily for work because I am a professional Facilitator and sometimes the audiovisual equipment I have to connect to only supports a VGA connector which means I have to use external speakers for sound. This little speaker delivers a lot of sound for its size. I can easily cover a room with 50 bodies in it. The speaker travels well because of it's size but because of it's quality construction it is heavier than less expensive options out there. I purchased this speaker during Amazon Prime Days  while it was on sale for $89.99  which makes me twice as happy with my purchase. I didn't rate the battery life because I rarely use it for more than two hours and I always make sure I recharge it before I use it again to insure that I always start off with a full charge.,5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0

Through the app (if you choose to use it) there’s several settings to adjust things like how long to wait in standby mode before it auto turns off... it’s a nice feature to save the battery. It easily recharges with most micro-USB cords (as long as it doesn’t have a super short tip; all my generic cords work fine but my Panasonic earpiece charging cord is too short).  When it starts charging there’s a single audible beep plus a continuously blinking red colored dot- so you know it’s working, which changes color again when it’s done charging.FYI: you can play music etc while it’s charging.",4,1,2018-4-7,1,0,0
"When I first got this unit about a year ago it was perfect. It filled up small rooms with sound, it had a plug in for an aux cord so I could use it to enhance sound from my TV and it had the battery power to go portable for a few hours.Fast forward about 6 months, this unit became plagued with issues. It will stop charging and randomly just not play sound despite being connected to a bluetooth. These complaints are well-documented online as well. Specifically for the ""doesn't charge"" issue - there are several work arounds you have to use including plugging it into your computer and updating firmware - constantly. Spending over $100 on a speaker, you don't want something that you have to worry isn't going to charge or requires you to fuss around with every. single. time. you want it to play.",2,1,2019-1-10,1,2,0
"I like the look and have used the older model as a travel speaker for a few years. Got these so I could have a mostly wireless solution for my desktop. Troubleshot for a few hours and found that Party/Stereo mode just don't seem to work with Windows. Syncs fine to my phone, but when connected to a bluetooth adapter on PC (tried two dongles on two PCs, both working fine with another pair of headphones), delay jumps up by about half a second, and constantly cuts out back and forth on the paired speakers, as if it doesn't know how to process stereo output from a PC. Happens in both modes and doesn't matter which is the master.Again, this ONLY happens when connected to windows, it has no problem with my android device.",2,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
"If the speaker runs out of charge, you have to do a ridiculous hard reset (found that out only after searching the internet), and even then, my unit is dead only after 9 months. Tried updating the software at btu.bose.com, but that failed as well. NOT RECOMMENDED unless you want to waste your money. I contacted Bose, and they offered a new unit at a reduced price, but why would I spend more money to replace a faulty speaker with another one?!? Horrible, flawed speaker.",1,1,2020-9-13,1,2,0
I had 2 JBL speakers break in one year and I have had this Bose speaker over a year now.I wouldnt mind it being a little louder. Its mic function is poor. Its reliable. I trust this brand now and will buy them again.,4,1,2019-1-27,1,2,0
"This was a gift for my son, and I know nothing about it (except that his wife suggested it) .  But since he rarely thanks me over and over for something I give him, I'm guessing that it really was the perfect gift.

"⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ Sounds great, very portable!  Easy connectivity to Bluetooth. July 16, 2019REVISED:  ⭐️ That was my review until 13 days after the warranty ran out and it totally stopped charging. When the battery went dead, it died, too. I loved this but hate products that only last through a one year warranty. I contacted Bose customer service and after troubleshooting to no avail, they said if I return it they’ll send me a replacement for $75!!! What nerve! This is an expensive speaker! I complained and they said they’d take 50% off the $75. I have always been pleased by Bose products but selling something that only lasts a year and 13 days is unconscionable.

"This is my second speaker like this. The first one sounded amazing, like this one. But it stopped working in just over a year. I read so many reviews and it’s a mixed bag with these, but nothing beats the sound quality of Bose in my opinion. So I bought the protection plan. This one seems to connect a little easier than the previous one I had. The black sort of gets dirty easily. I had blue before and it looked like you could throw it around like a toy. I thought the black might look a bit more serious and get more respect.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,1,0
"Bought this speaker back in 2017 and have only used it <12 times. The sound is fantastic and it's very easy to pair and use with multiple devices. One day I was listening and it just quit. The battery was fully charged. It would not, and still has not, powered back on. I followed all the ""troubleshooting"" advice a person could Google, but nada, nothing. When plugging it into my PC, I get an error saying that my laptop can't connect with the device. Chased that down for over two hours, followed all those fixes and again, nothing. So disappointed that I spent (at the time) over $130 and could only use it less than a dozen times before getting so frustrated trying to ""fix"" it, would be just as happy to never see it again. Bose has some of the best sounding devices out there, but I will think twice before I buy another Bose product.",2,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"Probably one of the worst speakers on the market.Sound quality- for the price, it should be illegal. The sound is distorted from a distance and from the back.

"This is a very nice little bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is quite good, and the battery life is decent. It connects very easily One thing I really like about the speaker is that it puts out plenty of volume. It also seems very rugged (I already have knocked it off a table without incident). I'm not 100% thrilled with the soft, sticky coating, but I suppose that is protective. Very pleased with the purchase.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,1,0
"It's impossible to turn off  for more than 15 seconds if I leave bluetooth on on any paired device. It will automatically turn back on and reconnect. This is infuriating.If it's automatically disconnected from a device (say, after a computer falls asleep) then it will say ""ready to connect"" every minute or so until the end of time. It has woken me up on multiple occasions because my laptop fell asleep and it started shouting ""ready to connect"" continually. This is even more infuriating.",1,1,2019-3-23,1,2,0
I have had 2 of these for a couple of years. Battery life is great! On lower settings they will last 8 hours. The option for stereo setting in the app with Bluetooth with left and right really brings music together.The bad.. the app doesn't always work. I'm left at times to plug a speaker into the USB to get them to connect. Sometimes just have to close the Bose app out and restart. Usually after 5 minutes of this I can get the speakers to connect. The Bose software definately needs help. After every update I'm in hopes that it was fixed but its not,3,1,2020-8-6,1,1,0
The speakers are great when they work. The first one I had stopped working for no apparent reason soon after I purchased it. Luckily Amazon replaced the speaker for a new working one. In less than a year the second one stopped working too. I take very good care of my things so there is nothing I did wrong with the speakers. I've had a similar experiences with other Bose products. I love Bose but there products never last very long. I think I will call it quits now.,1,1,2018-6-23,1,3,0
I use it with my Echo Dot in the bedroom/bath.  I cannot hear the Echo Dot when in the bath with fan running so find the bluetooth speaker is perfect.  It pairs automatically even if I've unplugged it to move another room.  I wish the battery life was longer but learned to keep it plugged in.,5,1,2017-1-2,1,3,0
"had three of these, the first one served for over a year until it suddenly died. the second one was turning on by itself in the middle of the day and night, looking ""to connect""... returned it within a couple of weeks. the last one that was purchased in late August stopped charging in October... but unfortunately, it's too late to return now...although the sound is good, the recent glitches have cause too much frustration. not sure that will purchase Bose anytime soon again...",1,1,2019-11-20,1,1,0

"At first I was surprised with slightly bigger size over the mini some.  But playing my iPhone music list on this using Blue Tooth music sounded like the bigger Famous Bose Wave Radio. Now we have our favorite music available anywhere in the house. Terrific Hi-Fi sound,  rich not tinny or cheap sounding. And the nice color helps me find where it is when not in use ! Battery life five hours plus ! Any charger with usb slot works in Wall or Car.",5,1,2018-5-28,1,2,0
"I reluctantly purchased this Bose product even though I have 3 Bose Wave radios and a set of Bose computer speakers in my home! My home products are fantastic! But my reluctance was caused by some of the negative reviews of this product. Anyway it arrived yesterday, took less than 5 minutes to set up, and sounds phenomenal! Just finished listening to the Bose during my morning workout after pairing it with the Iheartradio app. So while I've only had it one day I'm quite pleased. Will it develop issues like were reviewed...who knows, but for now I'm happy!!",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"Bought one from a store for my work computer.  I liked it so much I got it again, except in this off white color.  Sound quality is great, especially for watching videos.  Better than a previous version of another Bose Bluetooth speaker I have.  They work great and take up a small footprint.  The only thing I don’t love is the weird off white color.  Online, it looks white but in reality it looks like it was white but a lot of dust got on it and looks dirty.  I recommend getting the dark gray color.  This is the one that I got for my office and it looks great.",5,1,2018-6-11,1,1,0
"First thing I noticed when I took it out of the packaging was that it was gray, not white.  I thought there was some mistake but as I did some more checking in Amazon reviews I saw other reviewers also said it was gray.  The sound was better than some sound systems and not as good as some others but, in the price range, it's quite competitive with other brands and models.  I returned it because of the color.  I liked that it left a small footprint compared to older Bose speakers.  Finally, I decided I would like to have something with remote control so I'm still shopping for a bluetooth speaker.",4,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0
"4 stars because I had to return the first one as it did not take a charge. Second one only accepted a charge when i connected to my laptop. Linking to 3 devices was easy. And toggling between them easy. This is first day using it. Played all afternoon  only issue is when my internet signal dropped for steaming streaming service I was using,  however it continued  on it's own when signal restored. Sound is good, only very very slightly muffled, probably related to water resistant case. Great to have poolside.  Will repost if something changes. So far good investment",4,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"Good portable speaker as expected from Bose.  It looks good, has pretty decent battery life and overall quality is very good.  I have used it for both music and sound for a MacBook (for TV and movies on the go) and it actually performs much better in this capacity.  The original Mini II has better base, and for really full sound I'd go for the Harmon-Kardon Onyx (at 2X the price) but overall a good unit and expect it to last as most Bose speakers never die (I have 30 year old Bose 3.1 shelf speakers that still get it done in the garage!).",4,1,2018-8-30,1,1,0
"I purchased this so when we are grilling outside we can listen to music, the sound is great and connected with my Alexa very easily,  would have been nice if I could ask Alexa via this speaker but does not work like that. It's not a problem for me but it may be a problem for someone else looking for one... its water proof, the material surrounding it is so soft.... if bluetooth is on, all you have to do is touch your phone on top of the speaker and it will connect automatically to your phone! Very easy to use compact and cute looking!",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0

"This is the first Bluetooth speaker I’ve purchased so I’m not in a position of expertise. The connectivity is simple and without any hassle. For such a small device the sound is excellent. Haven’t used it enough to assess battery life. The unit is well built, controls are simple, and the material is soft and durable. The only downside is the expected color was Red and it is actually a washed out hue between Pink and Orange. There’s no way I’m returning it and would recommend it highly to anyone that asks.",4,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

It has good sound, especially at upper loudness levels, and it also has a microphone, so you can use it with Android or Windows devices' respective assistants.The experience of using this in my office with my PC, then grabbing the speaker and going outside with my phone, or into the kitchen, is really quite seamless.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
I bought this and it was delivered May 13. I have only charged it with the usb. Never into an outlet. I read many complaints about people’s speakers dying years ago and even some recent ones. I’ve had it for 2 months almost 3 and it has been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Pretty awesome. Not so good for the car if you have poopy car speakers. But indoors. Put this bad boy in a corner a lil high up and it THUMPS. No matter where it fills the room with thumping music. Amazing sound quality. And only at around half or a little above half volume. Personally I’d recommend to never play on full volume. I don’t just to avoid any possibility of the speaker “dying” as the reviews have stated. No problems so far! Worth the buy completely. Battery life is about 4-5hours on medium volume. Higher you go the more battery it uses. Love it though.,5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"Started out as an excellent purchase, then three weeks after giving it to my son as a HS grad gift, it completely died. Would not charge, turn on, etc.  Bose makes great stuff, but will have to assume we got a lemon. Time for an exchange.",1,1,2019-6-30,1,3,0
"Updated 9/29/20: I will NEVER buy these again. I have had 3 of these speakers and each one had died just after a year of regular use. The sound is great, but they are way too expensive to be this bad in quality. The company will let you BUY a replacement at a discounted price, but that is still ridiculous. A $130 speaker should last longer than a year.I love these but I have had 2 die and need to be replaced. One lasted a few months and another one lasted about a year and a half.

"I really love this little Bose. Has amazing sound. Similar to the big ones, but for a fraction of the price. Hooks up wirelessly, through Bluetooth to my iPhone and my Kindle Fire tablet. Only complaint is that when it's actually on, there's a computer voice that says ""connected to (my name)'s iPhone, and (my name)'s Fire"" every couple minutes. I could do without the frequency of that. But I am keeping it 5 stars b/c honestly, just turn it off if it's bothersome and you aren't using it at the moment. The sound and price can't be beat.",5,1,2017-11-3,1,2,0
"Sound was fine. I liked how portable it was.After I failed to use it for a month or two, the battery wouldn't charge. I updated the firmware, tried the hold-the-multifunction-button trick, but it still would not charge. Because I waited too long to contact Bose support, it was out of warranty, and they only offered a discount on purchasing a replacement. I'm switching to a different brand. A battery shouldn't require this much babying. I have wireless headphones from a different company I didn't use for over 6 months, and they charged just fine.",1,1,2019-7-23,1,2,0
"I'm not totally complaining about this BASS issue, to me it is muddled sounding at high volume. The sound is acceptable at lower speaking volume but as volume goes up to the upper high end it tends to clip, sounding distorted.  As a plus, it syncs quickly to my iphone, which was nice. I downloaded the BOSE app. That's a waste. It only has a volume control. Would have been nice to have some equalizer control (bass, mid, treble).  I do recommend it for those who would be using it in a small bedroom or dorm and don't need a party boom box.",3,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

"Great sound quality and good volume from a small speaker. First time turning it on, it wasn’t very loud at all and I thought I would wind up returning it. After charging all night, I tried again and the max volume was way higher. Battery life is shorter than listed, but takes a charge pretty quickly. Haven’t pushed testing the water resistance, but works well in the bathroom during showers and no concerns touching it with wet hands.

Though it is annoying to hear it say every letter of every device paired with it, spells out ""S-a-m-s-u-n-g-7-5-2-1-etc."" and if computer is still paired it will mention that too. No biggie if it works. But one morning it suddenly lost all charge, would not recharge or respond to on/off anything. I wonder if it is because they do not provide a charger and depend on you to provide your own, which may or may not be fully compatible. I went ahead and ordered the fancier soundlink II that comes with charging cradle. I also made sure to get a 4 year protection plan. I don't expect the lithium ion battery to last forever. The packaging it came in offered scant protection, which may have killed it.",2,1,2017-2-25,1,4,0

I purchased one of these speakers for myself and was so pleased with the sound that I ordered three more for family members in different colors for Christmas.  It is very portable and easy to set up.  There are hundreds of albums and single songs available on Amazon and iTunes.  I especially enjoy moving it from room to room on cleaning day.  It's a wonderful distraction for a boring job!  It is also nice for background music when entertaining.,5,1,2018-7-1,1,1,0

"We favor Bose products here because of the consistent sound quality. This Bluetooth speaker does not disappoint, the Bluetooth pairing is quick and consistent, sound quality is very good for a small speaker, and battery life more than decent. There are definitely cheaper portable speakers to be had, but life is too short to listen to bad speakers. The Bose engineering under the hood is what makes this speaker special, and a cheaper speaker may look just as good, but pay attention to the sound and you'll see why we keep buying Bose.",5,1,2017-2-7,1,2,0

I was surprised as the name ""Bose"" usually stands for quality.",3,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0

The quality of sound it produces is also wonderful! There is no crackling or anything! I can also use the app to control the phones that it is unsung!

The setup is easy (directions included) - however if more than one person has this device on their Bluetooth list, it'll be a guessing game as different devices fight over connecting to it.

This is the second Bose speaker of this model that I have bought. I already had one for myself. Every time my son-in-law came over he would ask if he could hook up to it. He loved it so much I bought it for him for Christmas this year. He was so excited that I bought this for him because he loves it! I have never had an issue with the battery life. I haven’t had any issues at all with this. The first one I have had for over two years without issue. I recommend it.

I am not comparing sound quality to other expensive Bose speakers but this one can not beat my Google home pair or Insignia NS-CSPGASP2 pair sound quality.Bose made things complicated by keeping 2 APP platforms (BOSE Connect and BOSE Music).  New devices connect to BOSE Music and Old devices connect to BOSE Connect and there is no cross platform.",3,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I really like this speaker. I'd give it five stars if the battery lasted longer. It will tell you when it's full and it will tell you when it's medium and then it will shut off. I would say about six hours depending on the volume. I contacted Bose and they said that is normal and it doesn't say low or recharge, knowing that it makes it okay for me. It is a small complaint for a speaker with great sound. You can also use it while its charging, that's nice. I would recommend this product, great for traveling. I'm sure as the technology arrives they will improve the battery life. I have several Bose products and have always enjoyed all of them.",4,1,2017-2-22,1,2,0

Fairly loud- I work in a machine shop, so I needed something really loud, this barely keeps up ( I can't stray to far away from it). I really just wish it retained charge longer. Gets really irritating when I'm in a certain rhythm at work ( the music helps) and the speaker dies. I usually just leave it attached to the charger. Oh well...

I went onto the Bose website and found a forum that gave me instructions on how to re-boot the system processor. I did it and it seems to be charging o.k. now. It seems to be a common problem with this speaker with the complaints i saw after googling the issue. Typically, you don't see a quality product with these issues.

That was a great test to show the quality of workmanship.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
Amazing sound from such a small unit. Always seems to sound better when I put it against something. The only thing that's disconcerting is that it announces whose phone/device it is joining with and its very annoying. It will also swap while its in the middle of playing music if someone else comes in who has a device it already 'knows'. That surprised me for a Bose speaker...,3,1,2017-12-12,1,2,0
"These small speakers pack a powerful punch. I use them for camping, home cleaning music and parties. I did encounter an issue before when it would not turn on. I learned via online research that you cannot let the speaker's battery die because it causes issues with restarting it. I had to restart the speaker over 20 times before I was able to revive it. Now I always turn the speaker off after use and make sure there is always some battery charge.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,1,0
Arrived the same day of purchase. Instead of the following day. Which was SUPER AWESOME! So far its blown my mind away. The only speaker it cant beat.

Love the candy apple red too!,5,1,2018-5-13,1,2,0
This thing wants me to select English every time DURN time it is turned on. It wants access to my contacts. FNCK THAT. Dont get this thing if you like privacy. Dont get this if you want EASE OF USE. NO BRO. This thing wants you to have babies under its strobe lights. But you can only fnck at the speed depicted on the box. FNCK THIS THING I WANT TO BREAK IT. I owned the other version before they added all the needed linking of everything and it was wonderful. DONT BUY THIS THING. It sound like you need to turn it down ALL THE TIME. It cant handle anything being played at a reasonable level. NOTHING. I tried ALL the music. ALL OF IT. Fnch this thing and FNCK BOSE for making it.

"We purchased this speaker a little over 2 years ago but our outdoor oasis wasn't finished when expected so only began using it in Aptil 2019. The sound was good (although I wish it were louder), held a good charge, easy to transport, etc. Overall a good little speaker for the yard, until it wasn't. Went to use it this year and it won't turn on, won't charge, nothing. I expect more for $100+ speaker that is meant to be mobile and outdoors (was always dry and shaded) and I expect more from BOSE. If you are looking for a short term relationship with your speaker, go with this otherwise find something else.",1,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0

"I've had a fake JBL from Thailand for years and when I finally had battery problems with it I got the Bose thinking that it would be a better sound quality.  It is not particularly loud, and when it goes beyond its moderate volume it makes a crackling sound.  Disappointing from this brand.  The bluetooth connection is also a bit annoying.  It only half connects the first time, so I have to connect twice for the sound to come through. Again, I expected more from a premium brand.",3,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0

"Nice sounding speaker. We leave it on the bathroom counter and listen while in the shower. I probably paid a bit much for this type of use. With a bathroom fan and shower running together, why would one care about the sound quality? If you leave it in the kitchen maybe you'd be better served by this device.

"It is extremely difficult to link the two speakers per the app. I responded to a request from Bose to rate the app by asking for communication from them to no avail. In attempting to link the two speakers, one cannot find the other until a second or third attempt during which time I have to plug in a fully charged speaker so the speaker is recognized and then it shuts down and I cannot turn it on again until I unplug it and plug it in to the receptacle again and sometimes this allows the speaker to connect. It seems to me that it's the app but don't know. I would avoid this speaker if I were you, now I'm stuck trying multiple times to hear tunes.

"We should have paid attention to the reviews saying the battery quits quickly and permanently. We thought this was a pretty nice speaker until last week. We purchased it last Fall for use at our daughter’s wedding to play a custom music mix, and it worked like a champ. Since then we’d only used it occasionally to sit out on the deck and listen to music or when camping. Then we went to make sure it was ready for playing Halloween music for the trick or treaters this week. When we plugged it in to charge, at first it said battery low, and we assumed it would charge the unit from that point. Wrong. It is dead as a door nail. No lights, no voice response, no indication of charging after multiple times leaving it plugged in to charge and moving it multiple times to other outlets to make sure that was not the problem. Convenient that we discovered it had died too late— 2 WEEKS AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRATION (we purchased it October 11, 2016). More than likely it’s been dead for a couple of months but we just didn’t notice it as we hadn’t had occasion to use it.  Needless to say, we are less than happy about paying $129 for an electronic device that was very lightly used and lasted for barely a year, if that. I thought Bose was supposed to be synonymous with quality. Why such a short warranty? If you are confident in the quality of your electronic product, it should have at least a 3 year warranty. The one-year warranty tells me that they KNOW there’s a strong chance these are going to go belly up by one year.",1,1,2017-11-3,1,2,0

Please, save your money and look elsewhere to buy a Bose speaker or any Bluetooth speaker for that matter. *Also, wanted to note that when this speaker actually worked (and briefly), that neighbors phones would randomly connect to this speaker while playing music. Zero bass, top volume is weak to put it nicely, and the battery life on full charger would last about an hour. AVOID THIS PRODUCT.",1,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

If you are linked up to anything via the Bluetooth, you need to proactively disconnect the connection when you were done using or every time your computer powers back on by itself when it's in sleep mode, the stupid Bose speaker turns back on by itself immediately.

Love the speaker. Only oddity is that the included charger seems to have a connector that is a tiny bit smaller than a normal micro USB plug. Weird. It got sloppy so it doesn't connect right but that only meant that now a regular micro USB fits nicely. I have about a zillion of those cords and chargers so it's not a problem. It's actually a plus as the included charger was integrated with the cord and the ones I now use are not and can be used with any charger.,5,1,2018-7-9,1,0,0

"I have had a JBL Flip 4 for 6 months and wondered if this Bose Bluetooth speaker would sound better. It connected VERY easily to my phone with no app needed.

I did not have the Bose unwrapped for 15 minutes before it was reboxed and being returned. Very surprising for a Bose product that cost 33% more than the Flip 4 ($100 vs $75).  Do yourself a favor.  Buy a JBL and skip this Bose.",2,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"The multi-device Bluetooth feature is complete crap. I hate it. No notification sounds come from your phone or the speaker when you have another device playing on the speaker. I'm constantly resetting the speaker and re-pairing it with my phone. Poor, poor design.",2,1,2018-3-2,1,2,0
i just received my speakers and i was blown away from the sound it's fantastic and easy to carry around. I have connected to my laptop and phone. This will be my main speaker for my laptop now. For charging the speaker i usually plug it using my wall ac adapter and i have no issues with it. I would recommend this speaker.,5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"It’s been turning off randomly and refusing to turn back on. Even though I know it’s fully charged. Sound quality is great but reliability is sub par, wouldn’t expect this from Bose but sadly I should have taken heed to the poor reviews. Save your money and buy another brand. Little birdy told me Bose is going under so it sadly makes sense",2,1,2018-6-18,1,1,0
Ok this could've been such a great speaker but Bose dropped the ball. The most annoying thing is the connectivity. Sometimes it didn't want to connect regardless if you use the app or from the Bluetooth settings in your device. It is more difficult when trying to sync two speakers together. I have spent an hour trying to sync both of these together. Mostly I end up having to reset the stubborn things!,3,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
I love the way this speaker sounds and its great for travel. I take this outdoors with me everywhere. I love the color as well. Once paired to your phone you can control it from there. I would suggest getting a cover holder for easy carry.,5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"This was bought as a gift for my husband, but I couldn't wait all summer to give it to him because I knew he'd want to use it outside all summer long.  I'm so glad I didn't wait!  It was the best speaker for range, sound, and portability this summer and the best Prime Day deal I took advantage of this year!",5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"We’ve had this for about a month so far. So for the short term, it is a very nice speaker. The sound is very good for being small. Out of the box it had maybe a 50% charge and was super easy to connect to multiple phones. Haven’t had any of the glitches from other reviews, but then again its only been a short time. Like that it’s water resistant, although I wish it was water proof because the speaker gets used a lot by the hot tub. Also we really like the soft rubberized texture of the out side. Overall in all honestly it’s pricey for what it is, but that’s expected  from the name BOSE. I would say its around $30 more than the closest  name brand competition in size and sound.  In the end we are very pleased with the color sound link II and would recommend.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"I have had this speaker on my Wishlist for over a year, so when I was planning my mother's graveside service, I knew this would be perfect.  And it was.  The day was clear and cool with just a light breeze.  The speaker was out of the way and the sound was so beautiful.  So glad that I purchased this speaker.",5,1,2018-8-20,1,1,0
"What do I need to really say about this Bose speaker? Bose is absolutely the best. The sound quality is great and I like that I can take it anywhere. When I travel it is always with me so I can listen to my favorite radio station, Pandora or my music on my iPhone wherever I am. I own two of them and also bought my daughters the smaller version. They love them.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

"This is a nice little BT speaker.  It's intuitive to use, sounds good, isn't too big, and rugged enough for my needs.  I originally bought the JBL Charge 3 and returned it because the sound quality didn't meet my needs.  Bottom line, The Charge 3 is a great speaker if you're looking for full waterproof, thumping base, aren't picky about sound quality, and want to be able to turn it up loud enough to fill a large indoor or outdoor space.  If you are interested in sound quality, want to hear all the instruments and vocals,  listen to a podcast, or fill the kitchen or bedroom with sound go with the Bose.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"I also have the Bose soundlink mini which has a far superior sound than this one.  I was gravely disappointed with the quality of sound on this one.. jazz music is really flat sounding on this speaker, it drives me nuts.  I wish I would have returned it; But alas I have settled for barely tolerable sounds just to save a buck.",3,1,2017-2-21,1,3,0
"Was really nice for the three or so days that it actually worked.  It stopped taking a charge, and the usual recommended ""fixes"" did not work.  Very, very disappointed in Bose.  I thought Bose had higher quality standards than this.  I can see they've gone downhill.",1,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
I get lots of compliments on the sound of this speaker when I bring it to parties. It’s sounds great. But the sound is directional. I would like a 360 degree sound which I knew this doesn’t provide but this speaker fit in my budget more than the UE mega boom or the Bose 360 speakers. If you can spring for the more expensive 360 degree speakers. Go with them. If not. This Bose sounds much better then the JBL charge 4 and the UE boom 2.,5,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0
"This product will no longer take a charge left it plugged in for days and nothing.  Won't turn on more than a second.  Looking into reaching out to customer service,  and looking for warranty.  Such a bummer.  The older model I have has lasted YEARS!  excellent piece of equipment.  This one... Not so much.  Will change review based on experience with customer service.",1,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"Positives: The sound quality is amazing even at high volumes. It charges quickly and won't die like other bluetooth speakers when plugged in and playing music on low battery.Negatives: Sometime it does not pair or it starts to pair with multiple things and then starts saying ""Now Connected To..."" each thing back and forth.  The firmware updates also are super slow on the Bose connect app.  Battery seems to not last as long.",4,1,2018-11-10,1,0,0

In true Bose fashion these speakers are simply the best. Great sound. Plenty loud. They instantly paired with my iPhone. They are great to have outside. We leave them out of the sun on the built in bbq and you can totally hear while your in the pool. This is our second set just to have more round the house.Highly recommend,5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
"I hand this Bluetooth speaker for only a little over two weeks and it stopped working, it will not charge. When I plug it into to charge it flashes indicating that it is charging but switches off after less then 5 seconds.  I'm very disappointed in this product.  I had the previous version for about two years before it two stopped charging so I was forced to buy a new Bluetooth.  The sound is great and the battery life is far so I decided to buy the this new one. Only to be let down with pure disappointment. Time to start looking else where for Bluetooth section.",1,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I bought a Bose because they are a top name in speakers and I wanted something quality. This is quality. Great sound, doesn't sound like crap when you crank it up, connects from at least 40 feet away on another story of my house, and is easy to work. Love it, and you will too. The problem with the Sonos speakers are that you need to download some app to use them properly. This just quickly hooks up to your phone and you're ready to roll.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,1,0
"I own an aquatic blue version for several years and I love it so much. I saw that these were on sale! I also love the color exclusive Midnight Blue. I've been waiting for another blue color.

"I really liked this speaker until the battery completely died after 1 year, 8 months. It won't take a charge and the speaker won't work plugged into power when it has a dead battery. For this, I would not recommend. Rechargeable batteries ought to last at least five years., and even then they should be user serviceable.",2,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"Sounds great, but with the size of the room I need two speakers either in party or stereo mode. And, since, the second speaker stopped connecting to bluetooth, I'm in limbo for 3-4 weeks until Bose sends a replacement. Phone support was patient, but after 10-15 minutes with them, they determined what I already knew: no way was that second speaker going to make a connection. Hoping not to spend so much time swiping the little speaker icons on the iPad app when the replacement arrives. Not used to having to clean the screen quite so much.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0

"This definitely wasn’t what I expected from Bose. This item was cute, the right size, but had none of the base and sound one would expect from the company.

You could get a better sound from a standard sound bar✍🏾🤷🏽‍♀️",1,1,2020-8-30,1,1,0
"Small, powerful and great sound from a small unit. Rechargeable battery has good life unless you forget to switch it off when you have finished using it.

I don't think I have ever purchased a product in which they do not give you a direct way to charge the product. Oh they give you a chord but you have to purchase a plug in to be able to use the chord they give you. I bought one about two years ago and really liked it so I purchased another one.  I was half tempted to ship the product back due to not having a $3 plug on a $140 product. Its like buying a car and not getting a battery with it. It just doesn't make any sense.,2,1,2017-7-24,1,4,0
"It has a great sound, especially for such a small speaker.  It is packable and sturdy.  The bluetooth is easy to sync.  I'm not sure how far it reaches though, I've never had my phone too far away.

"this is my 2nd Bose Sound link speaker.  I think the first one lasted a few years before the battery would no longer accept or hold a charge.

After receiving the speaker I download the Bose app and it wanted me to update after the update the speaker died and is completely unresponsive to any buttons or the charger and no lights light up the app said that the update was complete and gave no message of a failed update so now I have a paperweight that I haven't even heard how it sounds yet,1,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0

I love this speaker. It is the perfect portable speaker. I've had it over 2 years now and use it daily. It has great battery life for when on the go and great sound quality when you want to jam out.

"This speaker really packs a punch!  Awesome bass for such a compact speaker. Bose makes the best products and this one doesn’t disappoint.

Great sound for its relatively compact size.I now have 3 of them for coverage around the house. Blue tooth is far more stable compared to wi-fi at our household.

Bose use to be the top dog. The connectivity is rediculously hard to set up with more than 2 speakers. You also need multiple adapters. They are crystal clear but not much volume to them. In my opinion Bose is loosing ground and the name isnt what it use to be.,3,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
Great speaker!! You have to put the speaker next to the wall so the sound can bounce off good!! My Dad told me yesterday and I did that you guys!! It sounds great! At first I was upset when I got it and the sound quality wasn’t so great until I did what he said and it sounds amazing now!! This particular speaker is made for carrying around outside and around your house etc. so it must be put next to a wall to carry off good sound. Hope this helps everyone out that wasn’t aware.,5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"We loved it for 9 months. The sound was fantastic, it was SO easy to use. And then it just stopped working! Apparently there is only a 6 month warranty. So convenient! I'm shocked that a company known for its quality can't guarantee that it's product will last longer than 6 months. Considering that we only used it around the house, and never even had it around water, I am extremely disappointed.",2,1,2018-3-28,1,1,0

We love to play music at dinner time and this little speaker really delivers!  The sound quality is superb and it connects easily to my IPad.  Also its range is excellent - I have carried it more than one room away from the IPad and it continues to play flawlessly.

"This speaker is absolutely the best portable Bluetooth speaker that I have owned. It is Bose, so I wasn't expecting anything less. Some reviews claim that it lacks bass, but the thing is 5"" x 5"" x 2"" thick, so yes it does lack a little bass. However, it has the best sound and bass out of all of my Bluetooth portable speakers (5). I chose white so that it wouldn't get as hot in the sun.

At first we thought it said battery dead which seemed unusual since it had been off the charger for less than an hour, but after plugging it in and turning it on we received the battery fried message and the power light was blinking yellow. The reason for 1 star? We've had this speaker less than 4 days and have listened to it less than 10 hours. Has the Bose quality disappeared like so many any other products that used to produce quality items that are now crap with the name recognition?",1,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
I love this speaker the battery last a while and it always connects easily to my phone. I ordered one and it died a couple days after I got it so I exchanged it without any problems and ordered another one as a gift for my mom.

I live in a hilly area so radio stations are sketchy over the air. Since the Bluetooth range is 30 feet I can leave my iPad in the dinning room and take the music with me out to the patio, to the garage, or even to the bathroom while showing with no problem.

"I bought this product for myself to use around the house and while I'm at work. My boyfriend owns the Color Soundlink I that we used quite a bit and so we are familiar with Bose products. The first speaker I bought worked wonderfully for about a few hours until the speaker died. When I plugged it in, it would not turn on to charge or light up in any way. Luckily, I was within the parameters of time to return the product to Amazon and request a new one be shipped. I received my second speaker a couple weeks later and used it for a little less than a month with no issues. I was able to use it until it died and charge it again. Less than a month after receiving my new one I ran into the same issue. It was not able to turn on even when plugged in and was not telling me if the speaker was charging. This was shocking since this was my second speaker from them and the same defect happened once again. Luckily, through Bose support I was able to reset my speaker and turn it on again but not after going through the trouble of waiting through being on hold for several minutes. I am honestly disappointed in the manufacturer quality of this product if this is an issue that needs to be fixed and have not publicly posted. There's no saying when I will have to reset my speaker again and go through the tedious process. I am upset because I am usually a large supporter of Bose products, but this is not their best.",2,1,2017-3-2,1,6,0
Covid-19 has kept me at home and communicating with family and friends via my MacBook Pro.  The built in speaker kept distorting the sound.  I purchased the Bose sound link to help remediate the problem and it works perfectly.,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

"Initially I absolutely loved the sound quality.  It hasn’t been 4 months and this speaker does not properly pair nor is the sound quality superior.  I purchased this speaker to replace my JBL speaker.  I am so disappointed.  I trusted Bose as I have several Bose products, including a headset (for travel) and subwoofers in my home. This is so unacceptable.  I need a replacement. Immediately!!!!!!",1,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
Ordered these as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love this speaker.  It was easy enough for them to get hooked up to their phones and the sound quality is great.

"This speaker came in literally less than 24 hours, I was shocked. I love Bose products - you can have multiple people connected to the BT at the same time which is helpful.

I own the original Bose Bluetooth Soundlink speaker and just love it.  Only problem is that it is not really designed to be out without cover.  I ran into this speaker in Walmart one day.

I haven't found anything in this price range that provides such quality sound. It was purchased to pair with the Amazon Echo and was surprised with it's performance.

Sound and bluetooth connectivity were great.  Icons on top of the speaker are tiny. Mine quit after a month and after calling Amazon and being transferred to Bose support it would not reboot.  Bose support sent me links for the UPS label to print and send back with.  I hope the replacement is better.  Going through the customer reviews it is a recurring problem so beware.  Really disappointed with Bose.,2,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0

I'm old(!) and even I could set it up it was so stupid simple with one notable exception; it asked me to press the multi purpose button and I didn't know which button it was and there was nothing in the instructions naming the buttons! I told you I was old!! Please spend the money to buy this speaker. I've owned the $29, $49, and $89 ones and they never have enough sound to hear other than for personal use.

No applications to download and it plugs into a wall outlet or can be charged for portability. I left my iPhone plugged into the wall while it plays to keep the battery up but it is not necessary to do this for it to play. It's everything and more I hoped it would be!!

I have been a loyal Bose fan for 25 years and will always be unless I see this in the future. The sound quality is not at all what I’m used too and I had several unsolicited comments as well. I have had the Bose revolve and other smaller blue tooth speakers so I sent this one back and I’ll try the larger units again.  The battery life is poor and the usb outlet on the unit was misaligned.,2,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0

The speaker worked fine for a few months and then it stopped working.  It does not seem to be able to charge.  Of course it failed after the warranty has expired so nothing can be done.

"Update 7/21/17 - My replacement speaker is still working fine.  However, a second one I ordered in Dec and gave to my adult son in February stopped working two weeks ago, less than five months after I gave it to him  What is going on at Bose?  I certainly hope I can get a replacement as this is not an inexpensive product.The bad part first:  After 10 days, my Soundlink stopped in the middle of a song and I could not turn it on again. The player had not been abused in any way. It stopped because of a defect in the speaker. I wonder who supplies their batteries.  I found reviews by several other people who had had the same problem.

Reason I am giving it a 3 is because it doesn't come with a charging outlet. Just come with a wire. Don't see if you pay 130 dollars for a speaker they will not put a charging outlet in with it.,3,1,2017-7-21,1,1,0

It was great while it worked - but it's dead after 3 1/2 months. Followed directions on Bose troubleshooting page but nothing worked. Can't find Any information about whether it has a warranty - absolutely no documentation in the box - which is where the website says it will be.... very disappointed for such a short lifespan at this price.,1,1,2017-7-15,1,2,0
I LOVE this speaker.  It has great sound quality for the money and is very easy to use.  It is small enough to put in my basket when I ride my bike and it is great for the pool or the beach.  I have really enjoyed it.,5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0

"I like the size, and finish of this product, but what I don’t like is it is hard to find a good volume setting. It is either too loud and makes the speaker sound funny or it is too quiet and not really getting that sound energy you want when listening to music",3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

"Bought the Bose for the sound clarity and the Color II did not let me down. I prefer this over the bass-inclined JBLs. The Color II does clip bass when playing loud but for a speaker its size the bass is more than satisfactory. However, I did encounter a few issues when connecting devices using the Bose Connect app. Overall, great product if you are looking for a Bluetooth speaker with good sound clarity.",5,1,2018-1-30,1,0,0

"The sound was very good and the Bluetooth pairing was simple.  However, with 2 devices paired, the speaker just shut down.  It was advertised that it could be paired with 2 devices simultaneously, however, the tech support told me that was the problem and I had to unpair one of them to make it work.  I found the voice prompt confusing and the instructions in the box were USELESS!  Ultimately it just wasn't worth the price for what I got.  If I had really wanted the portability and waterproof qualities, it might have been different, but I only wanted it to use with my iPhone (Siri) and my Echo Dot.  But they cannot work together without turning one or the other Bluetooth off.",3,1,2016-12-29,1,1,0

I spent about 2 hours on the phone with Bose and we managed to sync, but still didn't come out of the speakers, just the computer.  I returned it today, and went to my local store that sells sound equipment and I tried a Bose speaker there and found out that my computer was too old (2012) and the drivers wouldn't work for the Bose speaker.

Also, it got caught in a loop only playing the last song it played until I had to turn off and on a couple times to reset. Lastly, u cannot make calls, take pics, or anything really while using a connected device. The range is not great either, goes from 15 to like 30 feet seemingly dependent on the wind or other interference. Sound is good to great when device connected is close .",3,1,2017-8-27,1,0,0

"I bought a Soundlink Color I several years ago. No problems, no soft covering.  The Soundlink !!  has great sound and is easy to connect to your bluetooth device. A minor problem is when connecting, the speaker looks for a mobile device when there is none and never has been  A major problem is controlling the volume.  It is almost impossible to accurately raise or lower the volume.  It was unclear from the manual whether to press the control repeatedly to adjust the volume or to press and hold the control until the desired volume is reached.  Since I was having difficulty,  I called Bose.  They said to press repeatedly.  This did not always work so the volume is frequently too loud or not loud enough.  The control is covered by the soft, waterproof material and there is little positive feedback when adjusting the volume.,",2,1,2017-12-21,1,3,0

"Weighing in at just over a pound this speaker is incredibly light and easy to carry around. The colour is very bright, with plastic moulding also makes it splash and rain proof, perfect for the British weather! The Sound: Extremely easy to connect to your tablet or smart phone, using the Bose connect app. It will also store the last 8 devices for auto connection when using again. Simple! It also has a great feature which links to Siri, if you apple products, enabling you to utilise all the offerings such as voice commands. For such a small speaker if defiantly packs a punch, I’ve found for the best sound outputs its best placed about 50CM from a wall. We had a few people (10) over for a BBQ, we had the speaker at full capacity, with no distortion, and it was plenty loud enough. We had to turn it down some so we could hear our friends talking. You also have the option to link this speaker to another of the same kind to make a stereo pair. I’ve just ordered another one. On full charge our battery lasted just over 7.5 hours. I’d defiantly recommend this speaker, excellent build and sound quality. Exceptional value for money.",5,1,2017-7-10,1,1,0

However when I went to turn it on just now, in May, it won't turn on even when plugged in. Not sure if it's the device or the charging cable, but it's definitely not the outlet as I was able to confirm by other products working in that same power outlet, which is the same outlet where the device used to charge. The device doesn't work in ANY outlet any longer. This thing is now a hunk of junk I guess unless I want to spend part of my workday this week talking to their customer service.

"This speaker seems to have some glitchiness that the SoundLink I does not have. Some simple troubleshooting instructions should come with the product. For instance, I had the same issue as a lot of others - that once it was unplugged, even though charged, it did not want to turn on. I discovered that it matters where you plug it in - charging on a computer through the USB cable provided seems to be a problem - doesn't want to turn on once unplugged. I found a wall outlet adapter and charged it there and it works fine once unplugged. The instructions do say to plug it into an AC Power source - I assumed since the computer was plugged into the wall that plugging the speaker into the computer was the same, but apparently not. Also, for some strange reason it does not like my husband's phone - I got it paired, but it would not play his Pandora; then it re-paired with my phone but wouldn't play music (only allow calls). I fixed it by deleting the speaker from my husband's Bluetooth list (he has his own speaker anyway), and restarted my phone - it paired fine and played my Pandora. I also recently took a phone call, but turned off the Bluetooth because I wanted a private conversation, when I turned Bluetooth back on, it didn't want to automatically pair - I had to have my phone search for the speaker, and then when it did pair, it connected only for calls, it didn't want to play music. So, another phone reboot and it paired and played correctly after that. But that's a lot of glitchiness that doesn't happen at all with my husband's Bose SoundLink I speaker - I wanted one of those, but only used ones were for sale, so I got this one and have to say that it's not an improvement. Soundwise - fantastic!! I love the Bose speakers. I also like that it's water-resistant - I can take it to the pool and not worry about an occasional light splash or touch with wet hands.",4,1,2017-4-18,1,8,0

"If you expect that because this is made (or at least designed) by Bose, it will by some miracle of physics deliver room-filling sound, with deep, rich bass. Think again.

But no deep bass (if that’s what you’re after), no AC adapter, and 8-hour battery life.After exposing this speaker to everything from Skrillex to Dave Grusin, several well-produced classical pieces, spoken word, and several other sources, it appears that it’s designed for the Beat By Dre crowd (sans the bass).

I also read a review by another user who said: ""don't throw away the package the unit came it, as you will need it later."" The user was spot on. After two weeks of use the speaker died. The software would not allow future pairing. I called the Bose help center and they were very aware of the issue. I had to send my defective unit to them and upon receipt I will get a new unit. Two strikes against Bose. They should have sent me a new unit right away and once received it, I would have sent them the defective. I will never buy another Bose product again.",2,1,2017-7-23,1,2,0

"Fabulous sound!  Great bass tones and can get just about as loud as anyone would want at a party.  I love the ease of charging and playing this speaker.  Of course, with BOSE you can't go wrong!  I had the original BOSE colored speaker but it was stolen, so I replaced it with this newer model.  Even though it is a bit smaller in size, it's just as powerful as the first!  Not only is it every bit as good as the first, slightly larger Soundlink speaker,  it is a fair amount better sounding and more portable.  I love that I was able to purchase a hard carrying case for this.",5,1,2018-7-19,1,1,0

I was going crazy trying to figure what the funk was going on. I was googling like crazy. Bose identified the issue on their FAQ but their suggestions were lame and didn't help.I finally found a comment on an ifixit dot com forum that worked instantly: Hold the mute button (the one with 3 dots in between volume up and down) for about 15 seconds- it should turn on, but if it doesn't press the power button.",3,1,2017-1-13,1,4,0

"UPDATE! Contacted BOSE. They tried to get mine to work by giving me instructions. Still wouldn't turn on. (The extra warranty I paid for is not in effect until mnfr warranty expires so had to call Bose direct.) So they sent me a new charge cable but that took 2 months because they said it was on backorder. That didn't work so I had to call again and they said they'd send me a new unit. The new unit lasted 2 months and now it won't turn on or show power or anything. SO..... contacting Bose again.......I wanted a small bluetooth speaker for my mail truck. Several coworkers have Bose products and i love the sound so i found this one. I read reviews that said it suddenly stopped working but i thought, ""Hey, this is Bose and i've trusted them forever!"" so i bought it. Luckily i bought the extended warranty too (Just in case those reviews were right!) Turns out they were. Speaker had a full charge this morning and 5 songs later it just stopped. Won't turn on, won't charge, no light, nothing. So now i've started the replacement process......BTW, the sound is GREAT for the small size! And charge lasts about 6 hours.",3,1,2017-3-24,1,7,0

My ONLY negative is the color - the sales data showed a VIVID  RED - actually, the color is almost ORANGE (coral red they call it).  I can live with the color - the sound makes living worth while!!

This a great speaker. Battery life is good so far.Sound is very good but suggest getting the Bose app for a little more volume.,5,1,2016-12-17,1,1,0
"Pros : Small package , descent clear highs and midrange , nice rubber exterior .  Cons : bass is very disappointing . Inside a room the bass is pretty underwhelming , outdoors  bass is non existent . Battery  life on mine at 50% volume is 5 hours . Not what it's rated for . Price ! I don't mind paying premium Bose prices but this is the first Bose I've had that I feel is not worth the $129 . This would be better placed at $99.00 . *** UPDATE 11/8/2018 .... this speaker has officially died ! Will not power up and customer service call to Bose was a runaround having me do everything I had done again and again ! This is my second Bose soundlink color 2 to die after only 6 months or so ! Bose is not what it used to be !",1,1,2017-3-15,1,0,0

"I had received last year's model as a gift and absolutely love it.  I actually ended up gifting this version to my Dad and he loves it as well.  He is very technologically challenged and it was even easy for him to setup.  This may be small in size, but it produces a big sound.  I put this on my patio table outside and usually can hear very well in the back of the yard.  The sound is so clear in comparison to any other portable speakers I have used.  The price point isn't bad either when looking at the high end sound it makes.  The battery life is pretty good, but I would try to charge it after every use since higher volume listening like I do drains the battery quicker.  Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a portable speaker.",5,1,2017-7-17,1,1,0

Also, I ended up having to have it replaced because while it was connected to my phone via bluetooth when I took my phone too far away and it lost connection it shut down completely. It would not turn on to reconnect at all. I had it replaced and the replacement did the same thing right off the bat, but I lost it before I could return it to get a refund so I'm out $130.",3,1,2017-2-7,1,1,0

I travel with this and use it in hotels quite a bit, I place it close to a wall so the bass reverberates and provides better sound.  It pairs with multiple devices and there's no issues of it quickly recognizing the device I'm attempting to play with it.I also use as a speaker phone (Bluetooth to my iPhone) in conference rooms and in presentations while showing videos, I'll just plug in the audio cable for playing the videos - works great!",5,1,2017-3-2,1,0,0

"I have been disappointed by the Bose Speaker.I bought this after my JBL quit working; however, I have had nothing but issues. The speaker will not hold a charge. It randomly shuts off and I does not get as loud as the JBL did. I called the Bose customer support and they walked me through downloading an updater as there is a glitch in models made easier in 2017. Annoying. '",2,1,2017-9-28,1,0,0

"I never leave Amazon reviews and I order 5-10 times a month but I felt really inclined to leave this review. First of, I love prime and two day shipping, I've been wanting this speaker for awhile and when I finally bought it I was so anxious so two days was quick enough for me! Secondly the packaging it came in is sleek and modern. In addition to the Bose Connect app, the instructions were clear to get the system started. Thirdly, the sound is incredible!!!! I'm currently playing Michael Bublé's live album and it sounds like he's in my house. We are a Boss family with a stereo in the kitchen and three surround sound systems throughout the house so I had high standards for this speaker and man does it perform! Fills the whole house with sound! Some people complained the volume isn't as loud as they anticipated but I'm telling you I can hear music from upstairs with the door shut so maybe get hearing aids not a louder speaker.  I have yet to take it outside so who knows how it sounds out there.Overall great purchase I am amazed at the quality of the sound this little system puts out!!",5,1,2017-3-13,1,0,0

"I bought this to pair with an Echo Dot. I had heard other Bose products that I enjoyed and thought this would make a good speaker for the Dot. Unfortunately, that was not the case. My time with it was plagued with problems, and I finally sent it back. Here's why:Ergonomics: I purchased the black version. The buttons were extremely difficult to read unless there was light was shining directly on them. Also, putting the inlet for the power cord on the side of the device was a mistake. It looks awkward and should have been put in the back instead. And speaking of power, not including an actual charger on a device that retails for $129 is ridiculous. Luckily, I had one laying around. If I didn't, I wouldn't have been able to use the speaker after the initial charge faded without spending even more money.",2,1,2016-12-30,1,4,0

"If you're skeptical on getting this speaker, just go ahead and buy it. I've been wanting to get a Bose Soundlink speaker for the last few years ever since I saw one from an acquaintance. She had the older version in the color mint but I'm glad I waited until the Soundlink II came out. The speaker itself isn't heavy and looks more sleek than the last version and not as cheap. The old version is plastic, while this speaker is all that silicone material. The sound quality is worth the price. The battery life is quite amazing as well. I use it for my iPhone and my MacBook Pro as well. It is so convenient to have and enhances anything you listen to. I wish there were better colors though but you can't really go wrong with black.",5,1,2017-1-25,1,2,0

I have to go plug it back in to turn it on, for it to tell me the battery is high and I can unplug it.  And now today it won't even turn on at all.

"2nd version of the speaker I have purchased and initially it worked well for a couple weeks and now every time it connects (if it connects at all) it has horrible sound quality through bluetooth.  I have reset the speaker, dropped the connection and installed again only to have the same horrible sound come out of this speaker.  When it worked the sound was good quality but these are the same issues I had with the first version.  I used to swear by Bose speakers and have bought about 20 of their speakers over the various homes we have lived in (both in wall and mobile speakers) and the quality of the software they produce is really affecting user experience.  They have a long way to go now to catch up with other players in the market.",1,1,2017-10-12,1,0,0

"Got this for my mom who is in her late sixties and has always asked to have a portable music player she can have with her inside the home as well as outside the home when she is gardening.  I downloaded pandora on her phone, synced it with the bose via the Bluetooth which was easy.  Sound quality is good considering the size of the speaker.  I have purchased multiple pairs of nose speakers, home theater systems and noise cancelling headphones over the years.  Bose is definitely on the expensive end of the spectrum but they make great products, which last a long time.  I don't think that this speaker will be an exception.",5,1,2017-2-6,1,0,0

"D0 Not buy. I used this model Bose at a friends house. It was marvelous take it anywhere! Gets a little wet no problem!!! I decided I wanted one. So I did like most people put it on my cart wish list and one day I decided to go ahead and purchase it. First day sound ok, but every so often a crackling sound with the unit (huhhh) I don't remember this when I used it at my friends house. Leave it connect to the AC power all happy watch a movie with it all is well. Day three unit doesn't respond. Completely dead. Hold power button no use. Connect to AC Power nothing. Read Manual. Absolutely nothing... All lights are dead on a brand new UNIT!!! Arrrr... I explained the problem to Amazon and they were wonderful and shipped me another one. (Sent the faulty one back). Still had hope for Bose! The new Bose Soundlink arrives and again like a kid on Christmas.Again the bloody unit goes completely dead. Press and hold power button ---> NOPE. Plug into AC outlet --> NOPE, AC USB plug ---- > NOPE.. Since I'm an engineer, I start going  from the AC plug and work my way backwards testing every component. Everything works well. Just the unit decided to die (completely non-responsive to power button) NO LIGHTS when connected to power. So I figured maybe hardware is fine and it was the silly software people who messed it up.",1,1,2017-4-28,1,2,0

I ordered a 3.5mm audio cable for about $5 and plugged it into my tv so for the first time in a long time I can actually hear my tv.  The bluetooth also works with my laptop and phone.

"Great little speaker. The sound is nice for the price and it fills the room with a nice sound.

Worked really well but now it’s dying after less than a year.  Not holding a charge and turns itself off after 5 minutes even when plugged in and says it has a “medium charge”.  Never dropped or abused.  Great when it worked but now I’m replacing it with two units (one upstairs and one downstairs that together are less than I paid for this .  April 2017-January 1. 2018.

I have been on the Bose web site and tried all the things they suggest; as well as looking at suggestions from the web. I have updated the software, as well. It just won't charge the battery and turn on ... so now I have a $135 paper weight!

"Buyer BEWARE!! Brand new, literally used about 3 times, and next thing I know it stops turning on. I left it charging so that obviously was not the issue. I called technical support and now they're sending over a new one because even with the step-by-step reboot instructions, it still wouldn't turn on. It's still completely dead and technical support couldn't tell me what could've possibly happened. It doesn't make any sense how a completely brand new product could just die.

"I own five Bose products and this thing puts out a great sound, which is what i expected from Bose. All for $99.. the only issue is, I wouldn't say it's ready for the beach or too close to the pool. I think the water photo is a bit misleading... I wouldn't get this anywhere near water.  There is no insert/plug to protect the headphone or AC ports. I own two Excogear for the beach. They sound close to the bose and once you get it into the sand, it produces good base.  The lack of protection of those two inputs is  design flaw, IMO, and if they figured it out, this would kill it the market.",3,1,2017-5-31,1,0,0

"I have an older car that doesn't have bluetooth. I've been using a Jabra Freeway as a speaker phone, and it works well for phone calls, but no matter what I do it won't play media (podcasts, music) from my phone loud enough to hear over the road noise.  So what I've been doing is plugging an audio cable from my phone to my car's aux jack for media files and using the Freeway for the phone.  But because some brilliant designer put the auxiliary port inside the center console, unless you want to drive around with the console open you have to close the lid over your cord.  So they keep failing.  SO I was hoping the Bose would perform both functions,  Sadly, no such luck.  It connects to my phone fine and all the phone functions work -- pressing the multifunction activates voice commands or answers the phone.  However, it has the opposite problem from the Freeway.  It plays media files just fine but no matter how I set my phone the audio volume on phone calls is just too low over road noise.  Now I am using BT to send phone to the Jabra and media to the Bose,  This works but only if you remember to connect the Bose first; if you connect the Freeway first the Bose can't find the phone.EDITED 1/25/17 I ordered a replacement. It had the same issue. I was still going to keep it until this morning when it suddenly disconnected from my phone, began making a humming noise,  and will not power off. Now I am just hoping it doesn't explode in my car while I'm at work.",1,1,2017-1-1,1,9,0

I have last years model that I would definitely give 5 STARS! My family has several Bose products & we LOVE them!  This model was a disappointment right out of the box as my daughter unwrapped her Christmas gift. Says Arctic White on the box-  it's NOT any shade of white. Speaker is LIGHT GRAY W/ SLIGHT TINGE OF BLUE. It looks like a manufacturing mistake in the color creation that some one thought would be passable. As if consumers wouldn't notice - are u kidding? This thing is UGLY! I seriously expect more from Bose. Especially since I have the previous model myself in Arctic White & it is the perfect shade of white.BOSE CORPORATION SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED & the individual who thought it was okay to pass off an obvious mistake SHOULD BE FIRED! It's false advertising - There a hundred shades of gray that are actually really nice looking (but u cant call them white) - this is NOT one of them.

"Expected a lot more from Bose. Definitely *not* up to par with the SoundLink® Mini Bluetooth® speaker II which my girlfriend owns. The sound quality is not that great if you plan on using this in an open room/space. Even in my bedroom I couldn't feel the vibrating sound which some of the better bose speakers command. The bass on this one is weak/poor: can only be felt from a few feet away. However, if you are looking for an average speaker and sound quality isn't a priority, this is OK. It may not be as bad carrying it in a backpack for a hike. Highly disappointed or maybe I just expected much more: I mean it is not a $10 speaker. If possible, you may want to test this at a Walmart or any electronic franchise carrying the product to be sure you know what you are getting into.",2,1,2016-12-12,1,5,0
"My original Soundlink failed, after only 10 months, for a really dumb reason, i.e. the power in-socket wore out! It became so loose, it would no longer make a connection. So ordinarily I would be inclined to get something different this time, however, in this price range, the Bose probably delivers the best sound, so I thought I'd risk another try.And the Soundlink II does sound good, much like the first, but it DOES have a major problem, right off the bat! That problem is that the power transformer, i.e. the power ""block"" seems to be missing! In fact, I think it is no longer included whith the package (having heard something to that effect earlier)! WTF? Isn't that kind of like delivering a new car without tires (""we thought you'd like to buy your own"")?

"The standard Bose sound profile- clear,  bright sound but gets pretty hissy sounding at higher volumes. Punchy and responsive with midrange, but no low end at all. Wasn't expecting to shake the house down with this little thing, but this has zero base... putting it close to a wall so it has something to reverberate through helps a little.  It's also very directionally focused- if you're 3-6 back directly in front of it and move off the side just a foot or two, you lose a lot of the sound signature.I bought two for a garage gym and was unconcerned about the reviews that claimed it didn't have a ton of bass or that the volume did not go that loud, because I don't want to annoy the hell out of my neighbors with noise when I am working out. The pair up easily, thought you are limited to app are integrated in the Bose app itself (Apple Music, etc).

"As some have mentioned previously, the sound coming out of this little speaker is fantastic. The problem with this speaker is the battery and charging design. When the battery reaches 20%, it shuts down and goes into a kind of hibernation. So, 1) you don't really get to use the full battery, just 80% of it, and 2) you have to go thru a reboot and charging process.This speaker will not charge via USB by plugging into the wall like you can recharge your phone and any other electronic device.

I found a couple of reviews that mentioned resetting the speaker. I tried it and right now it looks to be working again. So thank you for the tip. I hope I will be able to continue using it once it charges.",3,0,2019-7-14,1,1,0
"It's an ok speaker, but it beeps infernally, even when turned off.  Hard to sleep anywhere near it.  I keep it in the garage, and bring it out when I want it.  When I get fed up, I'll throw it out-  then it can beep away in some landfill site somewhere.....  There might be a workaround, but since they don't give a manual with the product, you'd have to hunt down the solution.  If you have time.",3,1,2016-10-27,1,1,0
"I am a long time bose customer. I have always enjoyed the sound, the consistent quality, and the outstanding customer support. I had two bose color sound link speakers that I pair with my iPhone and Amazon Echos; over time there were some battery issues. I called the company and they were willing to discuss a return and if I wanted, discount and upgrade to the Bose color sound link II speakers. They provided me information about the differences and it seemed like they might sound a little bit better which would be difficult to do because I really liked the ones I had. The new ones just arrived and the sound is spectacular. And unmistakable improvement over the Bose color sound link-clearer, fuller sound across the spectrum. Deeper base, better separation, cleaner treble-and low volume or at full volume! If you are considering buying one over the other, I would strongly suggest paying a little extra for the sound link II. Both models are of course Bose quality and in my opinion have spectacular sound coming out of a little box. They fill a room effortlessly. The sound quality does not diminish as the volume goes up. Another in a long list of happy bose experiences.",5,0,2018-2-16,1,1,0
"This is the second one I bought. I loved the sound and practicality of it. Suddenly, it didn't work anymore. I couldn't charge it. I searched for the issue online, but couldn't find a solution. I bought a second one. And here I am, months later, with the same issue. After researching it online, I see that it's a very common problem with this speaker. I followed some steps mentioned. The power went back on for a few seconds and died again. And... that's it. I did everything that was suggested, many times. Now I need to buy another speaker and it certainly won't be this one. Not worth the headache.",1,0,2019-11-24,1,1,0
"It’s an average speaker, but honestly, I expect more from Bose. It sounds fine for how small it is, but it doesn’t sound any better than other, cheaper speakers. The thing that really upsets me is the battery life is really poor - only about 3 hours. Yes, I listen to it loud, but I expect a charge to last longer. I appreciate that the voice warnings come on (“battery medium”), but once it says medium then you’ve got like 20 minutes until it dies. Then when it dies all the way, it won’t turn back on. As in, if it dies, you can’t use it while it’s charging and low battery. So dumb. I think this speaker is worth about $50-$60, max. I was gifted this speaker and it was purchased at Best Buy, however, I reviewed it here because I think people should know. I’ve uploaded pics to prove I have the thing.",3,0,2020-2-12,1,0,1
Almost from day one I had problems with it not turning on and off using the button on the device. And it powers off in the middle of pay with plenty of battery lefts sometimes. The only way to power it back on is the connect a power cord and turn it on.  I've contacted support which was mostly a wast of time.  They had me update it which I did and the problem continues.  It also tries to connect to every Bluetooth device we one all by itself.  It can be 3am and you'll here it come on trying to connect to my laptop or one of our phones.  Very bad experience with this product and the support is hands off.  They sent emails with steps.  No real contact or follow up.  Basically you lost your money. Would be great if it worked right.,1,0,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I loved it while it worked - for only 1 year!  It came on today and immediately shut off.  It said ""fully powered"" and then shut off.  It will not come on nor will it charge.  No lights will even come on.  Let's see, $120 for a year, that's $10 / month.  Decide if it's worth it to you.  Check the reviews that are from people who have had this for more that 6 months.  There are not many.  MOst people review it right after they get it.  The complaints from those of us who have had it over 6 months is it goes dead at some point 6- 12 months out!",2,0,2017-11-25,1,4,0
"I had the original Bose speaker and just before the one year warranty expired it stopped charging. I contacted customer service and they were great. They sent me an RMA and I returned the speaker and was sent the new color II speaker. When I synched it to my smart tv the sound was ok but the sound volume low. When I attached it to my phone it worked great and I was able to get much more volume out of the speaker. I've only used it a few times and the last time I used it, it worked fine but would not shut off. After repeatedly pushing to off button, it finally shut off only to turn back on all by itself. Now I can shut it off but without doing anything it randomly turns itself back on. I really like Bose speakers and have two other Bose sound systems that have worked and are still working great. This one, not so good.",3,0,2018-10-23,1,1,0
"Got a good deal directly from Bose for a refurbished Soundlink ll (SOUNDLINK COLOR BT SPKR II PLR WHT,WW,FR) in White $79 - order #WH04433014 . First problem is the color isn't white, it's a light gray. (seems like no big deal but I promised the wife it was white, fit her decor, etc & you know how that goes). The next problem was I had some issues pairing it with my Windows 10 computer so I called Bose directly. I first spoke to ""Joseph"" from their Tech Support and he told me I needed to call Microsoft directly because they are not familiar with pairing their device with Windows 10. I explained to Joseph (the Bose Tech) that there are almost one-billion computers in the world now running Windows 10 but that didn't seem to impress him enough to do anything but have me call Microsoft directly. I called Amazon directly to help pair it, (even though the Amazon tech knew I didn't purchase it on Amazon and it took about 30 seconds for him to help me pair the device. (I made a commitment to renew my Amazon Prime subscription thru 2039, LOL), goodness is Amazon great. I frankly was a little disappointed in the sound of the Soundlink, quite tinny and a bit of ""cracking/static"" sounding at about 3/4 volume or so. I'm deciding whether to ship it back .... but with Bose's customer support?",2,0,2018-3-7,1,0,0
So I wanted to like this thing but it is a total piece of garbage. First device I got stopped working completely after a few weeks. Went to Bose’s website and they had a alert for the serial number and said it was defective and sent a replacement.Second device over winter didn’t get used at all since we weren’t outside. Finally opened it up a couple weeks ago and charged it up. Worked fine out of the box for a few days. Today went to play music and won’t play again. Why the in world is it so complicated. Kept trying to update. It’s a speaker and a battery with a Bluetooth chip. It shouldn’t require constant attention to get it to work. Threw it in the trash because I was sick of it.,1,0,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I'm returning this speaker because Bose flatly refuses to address a major complaint from customers. When you're not using the speaker (and don't want to), any time any device comes within range, it will AUTOMATICALLY TURN ON AND CONNECT. Without your permission. If you disconnect it, the speaker will continually say ""READY TO CONNECT"" until you walk over and manually shut it off again. And then it turns back on again as soon as it sees another device. Bose has been aware of this issue for at least a year and a half and will do nothing about it. This is the first and last Bose product I'll purchase.",1,0,2019-9-21,1,1,0

"I've never been a big fan of Bose products. Way overpriced, mediocre sounding, and very base heavy. I though this would be a good compact, loud speaker for outdoors and beach. And for those purposes it is, but the sound quality is not great for what it costs. In typical Bose fashion, they emphasize trying to create very strong sounding bass from small devices but it lacks clear highs and is overwhelmed by very muddy sounding bass.. It can get loud but without some distortion. It's a nice speaker for the beach, but not worth this price. I put it up against multiple other speakers that were a fraction of the cost and the Bose was my least favorite sounding.",3,0,2020-1-3,1,0,0

"I recently purchased this speaker after researching several portable Bluetooth speakers. Let me start by saying while I think this speaker is fantastic, I am not a bose ""fanboy"". I own a few bose products as well as sonos, anka, and others. I do not believe  (rather I know) there is a single one size fits all brand for audio. I looked at several other Bluetooth speakers in the 100--300 price range before purchasing the soundcolor 2 (aqua blue). I was looking for a portable speaker to travel with when I travel for either business or vacation. The priorities for me in a speaker was sound, portability/ruggedness and battery life. This unit for my application is perfect. It sounds fantastic. As I write this review there is a gentleman sitting about 10 feet away from me using a beats pill, my speaker (listening to Pink Floyd pulse streaming in Apple Music) sounds full and rich while his (listening bon jovi) sounds thin almost as if playing from his phone speaker. The form factor of this speaker is perfect to throw in a bag, it is made of hard rubber and feels like it can sustain a drop and being knocked around in a bag. It does not look or feel cheap. I looked at the bose sound link mini and the 3. Both sounded fine, the 3 being the loudest and fullest the mini does not sound as good as the sound color with the sounds I played through them at Best Buy (Metallica, seal. Richie kotzen, Steve vai). I also did not want something so aesthetically engineered that it would require a case or bumper to travel with. I also played the beats pill and was very bass heavy for me while the sound color sounded much fuller and balanced. Battery life in this unit says 8 hours but I have gotten at least 9 without the unit dying. For how I plan on using this I do not care about a 15-20 battery life. For the casual traveler this unit is perfect. I listen to a wide variety of music from classical to heavy metal as well as podcasts and this unit sounds great with all of those genres. I hope this is helpful",5,0,2017-3-14,1,1,0
"What I like is it's great sound for such a small speaker. Bose truly is the best sound quality. I deducted a few stars for physical reasons. For one, when I took it right out of the box for the first time, the volume button is out of place. I tried to maybe push it over back into place but it wouldn't budge. Now I have to press & hold down the volume button to increase it. Not to mention there's an ugly bump on the top that shouldn't be there. Second, the cutouts for the aux input & charger are out of place also. I have to pull the silicone out of the way to even plug it in. Again, another flaw it should not have for the price point. Now lastly, the charging cord does not come with a cube to plug it into the wall. Again, for $130 I didn't want to have to go out & buy an accessory for it that should have been included.",3,0,2020-7-21,1,1,1
"BOSE sound in the size of a picture frame. Great little portable sound speaker.Very easy to set up the link and control devices with the the manual controls.

Around my house it lasts a few days, but I find a full charge lasts about 5 and a half hours on it's loudest setting. My BOSE included a USB charger complete with adapter. Osut of the box I followed the battery charging instructions and have owned the BOSE SoundLink for a year and a half, the battery takes the same usual 2 hours to charge and hasn't failed the 5-6 hour life at full range.",4,0,2017-11-19,1,1,0

The battery never went below 6 hours long after a full charge -- Not even after two years of continuous, incredible use. The sound was good enough that customers would often stop me and ask if I had a real person inside playing guitar. Was able to hear over the loud machines in my store, too. It finally died -- The end of an era, when it was dropped just one too many time onto a hard floor, and it never turned back on. Rest in peace, lil' buddy. You'll be remembered.",5,0,2019-2-7,1,2,0

Children to the elderly. Everyone in my family each has a different color.The sound quality that comes out of it is also amazing. It has really big sound for a little speaker. It is a smaller speaker, which I like, but it is not too small. It really does have big sound that comes out of it for how big the speaker is. I also like that the speaker comes in different colors and not just one color. I also like that there are no moving parts on it, and also around the bottom there is rubber so it protects it.

"I've had this  speaker for about two years. I currently own two pair of Bose home speakers and have always found Bose products to be of the highest quality. I recently went to re-charge the speaker after several months of non-use, and found it will no longer take a charge. I had it plugged into the USB charger and an AC outlet for several hours and it won't turn on. I went to Bose Support and found out it goes into a sleep mode when the battery is not charged for some length of time. Per Bose's instructions I tried holding down the multi-function button for 10 seconds while it was plugged in, and nothing. Then I went to see if I could get a replacement and Bose want's me to return the original (fortunately I still have the box), but then they want me to pay $75 for a replacement, when they only cost $100 for a new one. Why would I want to pay 75% of the original cost to replace a speaker that only worked for two years and then stopped? A few years ago I replaced a pair of 20 year old Bose 501 speakers and got more than 50% off for a replacement. This speaker does not uphold the Bose reputation and I would not pay more than $50 to replace it. I have a cheap little ""Musky"" bluetooth speaker bar I paid $30 for 3 years ago that still works fine and sounds just as good. Bose is definitely slipping in quality as far as this speaker goes.",1,0,2020-8-11,1,1,0

There's no charging dock so it looks flush with the area and it doesn't come with a wall outlet adaptor. JUST Micro USB. I have the Soundlink mini that looks kinda like an echo dot and it sounds better to me. The sound on this speaker sounds... off, like I don't know. But you audiophiles know what I mean. Next this thing is light. It may be the lightest of the 3 speakers I have.  And finally, the Bose App, I can't use my Soundlink Mini 2 with the Bose Connect App, but because my phone supports dual pairing I can get it to work. I post an update once I try with all 3 speakers.

"If you are trying to use it for stereo, STAY AWAY!  You cannot connect two of these speakers for the advertised true stereo unless you use the Bose app for playing music AND subscribe to a special Bose subscription service.  While a single speaker will play using the iTunes app, for stereo it is necessary to use the Bose app, and it takes over your music system completely.  While this may not be a concern for Android users, it screws up the iTunes system.For stereo, both speakers will almost certainly need to have their firmware updated.  This is a long and frustrating process.  NOTE-- Many of the people who have experienced their speaker being ""bricked"" may have had their speaker going through the firmware update.  While there is some communication about what is happening during the firmware update process, there is not much.  It's easy to think that your speaker has gone dead and then you start playing with it and mess up the update, and that WILL brick the product.",1,0,2018-5-11,1,3,0

"This little speaker looks and sounds great, but like many others have stated, I have had problems charging it. One problem is, there is no battery indicator on this device. It would be nice if I knew the battery when the battery was getting low. Yes, there is an audio feature that tells me ""Battery high"" or ""Battery medium"" when I turn it on, but it must not be able to speak when low. I've had this speaker a year now and have never heard it say ""Batter low."" It just dies. And charging is an issue IF AND ONLY IF the battery dies completely. In fact, I thought my first one was defective and returned it to the store. They couldn't make it charge either, so they gave me a new one. When the second speaker did the same thing, I diligently searched online (not through Bose who still doesn't seem to give a proper solution) but through online forums. There I was able to learn the trick to recharging a completely dead speaker. It really does sound great.

"I was looking for speakers and came across this speaker and tested it extensively in store when no one was there so there were really no sound interferences. I tested it with various settings and types of music at various angles and volumes. This product, like most Bose speakers, is complete and utter garbage. I am a jazz pianist and I have a well trained ear. This speaker can't handle lows (bass) to save it's life. The drivers inside the speaker are literally garbage and honestly very cheaply made as compared to many other speakers on the market. Bose spends a great deal of money on marketing and it is the marketing that fools people who don't know what to look for that their speaker is superior when in actuality it is garbage. I have a pair of Bose qc25 headphones and their noise canceling tech is excellent but the drivers aren't great either. All Bose products rely on this post processing digital mechanism to boost the sound and make it sound artificially better than it really does. Please don't waste your money on this product. Anyone who says its great doesn't know what to look for in a speaker, and I mean truly doesn't understand the complexities and components of sound in a song. I highly recommend the Sonos Sound One over this trash. It's sound is far superior than anything in the BestBuy bluetooth speaker section. It's not portable but it's sound will blow this thing away.

He had taken it on the roof with him while doing some clean up and ended up forgetting it up there. He just found it after spending the past several months looking for it. It has been on the roof the entire time. It has made it through several heavy rain storms, a hurricane, and being baked in the Louisiana sun, and it STILL WORKS!!!!

Yet, he brought it in, plugged it up to the charger, turned it on, connected to bluetooth, and went to playing music. The sound quality is just clear as it had been. We would have never paid $150.00 for this speaker, but I am here to tell you that it is well worth it.

"I love waterproof bluetooth speakers.  They are my great companions when I take showers and I have been used a lot of bluetooth speakers.  When I got this, I was excited because it was from Bose.  I have been using their speakers and headphones and have never been disappointed.  But, I hate to tell you that this would be the first product from Bose that I am not completely satisfied with.The Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II was a cute and nice waterproof speaker for sure. It had all the features that other waterproof bluetooth speakers have except a backward skip of a song from a button (please let me know if you know how to do this). The aqua color was great and the shape and rubbery finish of a speaker was satisfactory.  And the battery lasted long as the maker claimed.  But, when it came to the sound, all the nice good things started to get faded out.  This is a Bose speaker and it was natural to expect a good sound if not the greatest.  The balance of the sound was not adequate (I mean unbalanced) and it was not comfortable on my ears.  The bass was not rich like other Bose products and the mid and high range sound did not get blended well.  I could not believe that it was a sound from a Bose speaker.  I know it is a bluetooth speaker so it has its own weaknesses. But I could find a bluetooth speaker which sounds better.  I do not mean that this is a terrible speaker, however, it was just not close to the expectations that I have for any Bose products.  I might be biased, so I asked my daughter without telling her that I did not like the sound and she had a similar opinion.

"The sound quality is awesome; however, I have to give it a bad rating because of the terrible charging issues, complete failure of customer support, and the lack of a charging brick. First, Amazon is awesome. The first one of these speakers we bought wouldn't charge. Amazon happily took it back and sent another. The new one charged -- once. Once it ran that charge down, it wouldn't power on or charge, no matter what we did. We tried to update the speaker online, but since there was no charge, it wouldn't. We called customer service, what sounded like a call center in another country, full of untrained representatives who couldn't care less about our speaker problems. This person told us all kinds of bs about holding the power button down while unplugging the power source. It didn't work. Then, he told us that we must use the charging brick it came with; it didn't come with one. That is idiotic anyway. Bypassing a charging brick and plugging it into a USB wall outlet shouldn't hinder the charge. The completely useless people at Bose are sending us a brick. Woo hoo! I was very annoyed. I went to Amazon reviews, determined that another customer must have gone through this. I immediately found a helpful reviewer who said to plug it in and hold the three dot button down for 15 seconds. It worked!!! Thank you Amazon for making up for yet another company's shortcomings. In short, buy the speaker, but don't forget the three dot button trick because Bose will be of no use to you when your speaker won't charge.",2,0,2016-12-30,1,2,0
"Nice build, nice connectivity. I especially like that the NFC is always active (even when off) and it pairs/connects and powers on when I touch it with my phone. Good battery life too.The sound is not great for podcasts, especially for male voices - too deep/thumpy. For music, I guess it depends on one's taste. I do like to hear the bass, when there, but not have the extra thump/resonatotion (typical to a subwoofer turned up).",4,0,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I actually love this speaker, I received one as a gift and then purchased another. The sound is rich and a little bass-y. It's small, easy to move around the house and is easy to pair with many devices.My frustration lies with the charging. After having my speaker for about 6 months, I thought the cord had died. The speaker wouldn't charge. I tried other cords with no success. Eventually, I figured out if I wiggled the cord just right the speaker would charge. I figured this was an annoying but survivable anomaly. Then speaker #2 developed the same issue. This speaker is at my dad's house so the cords and user are different. Same exact issue. Again, we decided it wasn't too big of a deal to wiggle the cord until a proper connection was made for charging.",2,0,2017-1-28,1,1,0
Bought the first one at Sam's Club. It wouldn't work from the get go. Called Bose they couldn't get it to work. Returned and got another one this second one wouldn't work either. This time Bose replaced the SoundLink with a brand new one. Right about 1 year later the speaker plays for about 1 hour and then dies till its recharged.Also the sound seems to be getting a little scratchy.,2,0,2018-12-5,1,1,0

A no brainer.  I planned buying two so I could get that incredible stereo. I am blown away by the sound. I only wish I didnt have to recouple them everytime I turned the units on,but it sounds so great I am putting up with the minor frustration.Quite a few reviews mention that the product becomes inoperable after only a short time. I hope my speakers dont meet that fate. You would think with the quality of Bose that wouldnt happen. When paired in stereo they sound as good as any high priced stereo system. Bose is not hype.

"For a small speaker, very nice sound.  Better than UE Boom2. Works well in a small room.  Perhaps a tad bass heavy, but easy to get used to.  Nice to have volume controls on the speaker itself. Pairs well with multiple devices, which means I can control volume, etc., via iPhone even though the connection is with my desktop computer.One negative - The only adapter that comes with the speaker is a USB cord (no charger), which means that this speaker can not be charged and used at the same time via laptop or desktop computer without incessant beeping.  Very irritating.  Charging via a wall charger (my iPhone charger) no beeping.

Was not a good listening experience.I have been the the Bose store and they tell me this speaker wasn't intended for TV... Shouldn't that be my call? They said it had delayed sound, but I never found that to be the case. The sound followed the picture correctly, it just would not allow me to control the volume at all.",2,0,2018-8-14,1,1,0
"I originally was a little disappointed with the SLC2. It only sounds ""ok"".  It's impressive for it's size, but it doesn't blow you away like the Soundlink Mini, which is more what I was hoping for.  I like all of the features, water resistance, speaker calls etc. but I was still just a little down on the audio quality.  I found two solutions that make it 1000x better.  First, though I typically do not like to use equalizers, putting my phone on ""Latin"" EQ really improved the sound for rock music, which I felt sounded weak bass-wise and a little muddy without.  The second solution was to get a second SLC2 one and play in stereo mode.  I think (though I'm not certain) when the Left and Right channels are split in stereo, it requires less work for each speaker to produce the sound and made the music I was listening to much clearer and better.  I put one speaker on each side of my grill outside and the music sounded awesome.",5,0,2018-4-10,1,0,0
"I bought this Bose as a replacement for the color soundlink original version, which I got several years out of and still works.  (I knocked that one off a table while it was plugged in once, and it jerked the cable around in the back where you plug it in, so now when it charges you have to have the cord positioned just right.  That was entirely my fault, but I found it annoying so I thought I would upgrade to the newer version.)Sound quality of both versions is, in my opinion, excellent.  I use it at work and numerous people have commented on how great it sounds.  However, my issue with the soundlink II is that after a few months of use, it seems to not take a charge now.  If it died during use, the old speaker would play again as soon as it was connected to a power source.  This one does not, and what's worse I can't get it to charge at all right now.  I'm irritated because I only bought it in July.  Now that I see that so many people seem to have this problem, I'm even more annoyed.",3,0,2018-10-15,1,1,0

Definitely wasn't many males in the decision. .gross .i digress. .it is an awesome sound maker and is worth the price also there is next to nothing in accessories for this new model everything is made for the #1 ...not #2 ..and volume settings you can't hear much till ur past half way line ...finally if you are buying this for your phone. .be advised that this will not utilize bluetooth to talk the other speakers ive used allowed to communicate via speaker this function is omitted further your music session wont return to on play ...oh well i guess .nothing is perfect not even bose but as close as needed to buy. .so yes buy it just be aware nothing is perfect,4,0,2017-2-24,1,0,0

Beautiful little wireless speaker you can move around the house with you wherever you want. It is actually pretty powerful with a nice low end.

I'm not sure what those folks are looking for or doing with their speakers, but I got this as a gift last year and let me just say: this speaker is phenomenal. The sound quality is beyond what you'd expect from such a small device; the bass is real and actually packs a punch. I've had people ask where my subwoofer was when I'm using this speaker in my living room. I've never had any issues with connectivity, nor has the speaker ever stopped working. It holds about 7-8 hours of charge, which is admittedly less than I'd prefer, but it is what it is.

I received the aquatic blue color, which is a little ""too colorful"" for my tastes, and if I could choose again, would go for red. It is easy to pair with your devices, and both Bluetooth and NFC pairing is very quick. I have used many Bluetooth speakers in the past, and pairing time is one of my biggest complaints. Audio is very powerful and it can certainly handle a small room or a larger size, like an outdoor deck. There was little distortion when cranking it up to higher levels. I think the MSRP is pretty reasonable for this speaker, but it could definitely use a quality travel case.",4,0,2016-11-26,1,3,0

"Great sounding speaker with a major bug that Bose engineers seem to not care about.The speaker stays on, even when you turn it off and automatically powers itself on and connects to any devices it was previously paired with. Very frustrating to be woken up in the middle of the night hearing a disembodied voice announce that the battery is high and it is ready to connect. I am a big fan of Bose products but this bug was enough for me to return it. Bose has known about this for almost two years, but no change. Pity.",1,0,2019-11-20,1,1,0
"I really like this speaker - great sound and portability and looks for the price. My first one lasted three years until it stopped working. I was very happy with it and eagerly took it in for repair/replacement. That was 15 months ago. Over this time, I have had to go through the steps to fix it a number of times. Doing all the things on the Bose website and following the advice from their techs. I have probably spent - all told - 20/30 hours trying to get it to work right. Well, this one just stopped working - in the middle of a song. Did everything to restore and it just is dead. Bose response? ""It is beyond the warranty period. Buy a new one for only $75!"" NO THANK YOU! If it is going to last a little longer than the warranty period and I have to buy a replacement every 15 months for $75 I choose to but one that is engineered and manufactured so that it doesn't die every year.",1,0,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"It's great - good battery, durable, decent sound.

""Brendan's iPhone, connected. Brendan's iPhone, disconnected."" Opening your laptop for a quick email, or worse, for a college class with your speaker TURNED OFF in your backpack? ""Desktop-10539, connected. Desktop-10539, disconnected.""

"The Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II was a recent purchase of mine. This product would be great for any teenager or young adult who loves music and listens to music at least five days a week.

The speaker comes in four main colors, so an individual can tailor it to their preference. That was one of the reasons I chose this product, because I could get it in the color of my choice.

"It’s a Bose speaker. Of course it sounds great. I especially like to put it in an enclosed space so the sound gets bigger and fuller. Problem areas are all surrounding the battery..... Battery life appears to be reducing over time. At the beginning, the speaker remained charged for about 6 hours (I usually listen to music at a higher volume, so I expected the reduced battery life and was still happy with it). Now, though, I’ve owned the speaker for about 3 months and battery life is down to about 4 hours. Plugging the speaker into an outlet isn’t so much of an issue except that the speaker dies without any warning of the battery levels. (I’ve owned cheaper speakers that warn you when battery level is below 5-10% — this speaker has no such function except for if you press the button to check the battery levels.) So the speaker will cut out suddenly in the middle of a song and need to be plugged in for 3-5 minutes before it has enough charge to start playing again. A battery level warning would drastically improve my experience of this device.",3,0,2018-7-7,1,0,0

Lemme start off by saying one thing. There is but only much you can get sound wise from a small speaker. Keep that in mind. With that said. I think this speaker has great sound at 75% or less volume. Any higher and there is distortion. This speaker I imagine would be great at an office or at a desk. Where its not going to be too loud but loud enough to get great sound. I have this paired with an echo dot and it works great. I have echo dots volume set usually between 6-8. Solid speaker but not for everyone.,5,0,2016-12-26,1,1,0

And instead of replacing they are trying to sell me another at a discounted price. hell no, never buying Bose again. Their support and customer service suck. These are not cheap.",1,0,2020-4-7,1,0,0
"I bought one for myself after using my mom's.  It sounds awesome!  This is one of many Bose products I have used, and I am still impressed.  This thing has great portability and a long lasting battery.  It's small and easy to carry.  They also have carry cases, I don't have one but my mom does.  I mostly use mine for around home.  It's easy to grab from one room and set in the next room.  It also is powerful enough to pump clear sound into the main area of my house that is quite large and has a lofted ceiling.",5,0,2017-3-15,1,0,0
My Bose Soundlink Color II is just one year old and it will not work at all.  It will not power up or charge.  I tried troubleshooting tips - and it looks like this has been a known problem for awhile in this speaker.  I contacted Bose and they said the warranty has expired but that they would send a replacement for $75.  Why would I want to even spend $75 on this speaker again? Shame on Bose for continuing to sell this speaker when this charging problem is a known issue.,1,0,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I must step in and support Bose, I have the older model red unit and it's true to it's color, also this little dude is a kick ass speaker and I've had it for 3 years without Any Problems and I use it at least 3 x's a week.

"Bought this speaker a year ago and it worked well during that time, However, I plugged it in one night and the next morning the power cord, which came with the device, was melted inside the connection.  Apparently the battery conduit got too hot.  We used it in the shower everyday, which may have contributed, but that's allegedly okay and we also took it out and dried it off after every use.  I've had good experience with Bose in the past and this may have just been a lemon, but its worth noting.  Also worthy of mention - the battery didn't last anywhere near 8 hours.",2,0,2018-7-18,1,1,0
This was my birthday present but I had to return it because the battery was faulty.  Never held a green light and had a red flashing light when it was charging (which according to the site meant there was a battery problem).  The sound was great but the company needs to check these things out before they send them to Amazon.  Now I am waiting on an older model that has a better rep for reliability.  Too bad.,1,0,2019-9-15,1,0,0
Compared to the 360 model this speaker is just ok. If you like bass and depth in your music spend $50 more. If you listen to music that focuses more on high tones or instrumentals like classical etc this will probably probably be fine. I listened to 2 songs on it before putting it back in the box to be exchanged.,3,0,2018-12-23,1,0,0

"Short battery life, long charging time. Also, I was surprised to find that this speaker gives no indication when the battery is low while in use, other than announcing if the battery level is high, medium or low when the unit is first turned on. I have owned Bluetooth speakers half the price of this one that would alert you that the battery is about to die while the speaker was in use. This one simply stops working without warning, which is very annoying. I actually thought it was defective the first time this happened.

"The Bose SoundLink is a nifty little bluetooth speaker. It's water resistant and rugged, able to take a fall. It has a soft silicone exterior that I especially like. Weighing in at just over a pound, it measures 2.2 X 8 X 5.2. It is able to sit on narrow ledges and shelves - and does just fine on the passenger seat of my car. I like to use it to listen to music through my phone. And it's Bose - the sound quality is excellent and you can crank the volume way up if you want. I have several Bluetooth speakers and none can match this one's sound capabilities.Pairing is a snap - it even has voice commands to guide you. (When you pair more than one thing, you can use the commands to switch devices very easily.) It has a builtin speakerphone, too. I am very happy with this feature because it means I can talk hands-free in the car. You just press a button on the speaker and voila - you're on that phone.  (It can handle up to eight paired devices.)  The Bluetooth is supposed to work up to 30 feet away - but it worked quite a bit farther for me, despite several walls.",4,0,2016-11-5,1,0,0
"When I bought this speaker over a year ago, I was very pleased with the sound.  However, a few months ago, after an update, my Bose Speaker will automatically come on when I open my laptop.  This can be very annoying.  I can turn it off and right away it comes back on.  If my speaker is in another room then the people in that room hear it come on.  Apparently on the Bose thread, others have complained but the only response is, ""We are sorry this is occurring.  We will report this problem."" That's it.  Nothing given to fix this.

"Interesting color, but very good sound.  The bass is deep; the middle range could use a bit more emphasis.  In fact, things like audio books and podcasts come across with too much bass and can seem to ""mumble"" a bit.  But over all the sound is very, very good.  Volume is impressive without rattle or distortion.  Solid sound delivery at all levels.  The mic works very well for taking calls; it  provides a clear voice to the person on the other end of the line. Button controls are responsive with just the right amount of tactile feedback.  Connecting to my iPhone 7 was simple and took less than 30 seconds.  Controls on top include on/off; volume; bluetooth; and pause/forward/answer/hang-up combined button. The speaker has a hard/smooth rubber feel to it.  Charges via micro USB (included, but no wall plug).  Unit measures 5""h x 5""w x 2.25"" deep.

Great for use out on the patio at home too.  Bluetooth set was easy.  I put an extra long charging cord left over from an old phone in the travel case and it fits well.
