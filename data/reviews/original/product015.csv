"I bought this as an upgrade from the 50"" Amazon basics tripod I mistakenly bought, that was too small to really handle a dslr with a big lens.When the 60"" arrived, it had a few wear marks and was missing the quick attach mount. I'm pretty sure I ordered it new, so I'm unsure why it looks like I got an unchecked return.",1,1,2018-4-22,1,1,0
I have two sizes of AmszonBasics tripods and both of them far exceed all expectations I had.  I'm not an expert in tripods but the quality and the strength and steadiness make them appear to have cost five times what I paid for them.  I use the larger one to support a large brass catcher for my rifle and I use the smaller one for my spotting scope.I'm not a person to gush over products and I'm often disappointed with them but in this case these tripods should both cost much more than Amazon sells them for.,3,1,2017-8-30,1,1,1
worst tripod I ever experienced. You can not pan without shaky jerking movements. so light a small breeze can knock it down. I didn't expect much from the price and I got exactly that. I used as a 2nd camera support for a lecture I shot. If I didn't have the other tripod I would have been in big trouble. There is some good.quick release plate works ok.,1,1,2017-7-30,1,1,0
I brought it all the way to Alaska and wanted to shot the aurora but just found out it didn't function well!  So furatrated! The bolt used to adjust the angle didn't work. I throw the item away. Waste of money.,1,1,2017-12-29,1,1,0
"Purchased this tripod just 5 months ago. I used it pretty regularly and always treated it well. Started falling apart by month 4 and noe its almost not even usable. It takes a lot for me to give a 1 star review. Height adjustment knob broke off, and 2 of the leg locks are broken.",1,1,2018-3-18,1,1,0
Seems well built enough and light weight except the left-right motion was very sticky and refused to move smoothly even with the adjustment knob way loose. I ended up taking the difficult to remove top round nut loose and found the metal pad jammed. I removed it and lubed with shaft with silicone grease and now it is smooth. No need to lock it anyway.The camera mount part goes sideways too but does not seat exactly level. This will get me by until I get a more expensive heavy duty tripod. I pulled 2 stars for sticky friction problem repairs. Has an awkward long handle and it is reasonably stable and handles a P900 well but don't ever leave the up/down handle loose or the camera falls back or forward!!!  The handle is in the way of your face when viewing through the view finder. It cranks up and down well. Received earlier than expected.,3,1,2017-8-24,1,9,0
"For the money, this is a great product! For around $20, I was expecting a basic, low quality product to get me by. All it had to do was hold my camera (Nikon D5000) in place and I would have been satisfied. To my surprise, there are features included with this tripod that are on $40+ tripods! Two different bubble levelers, one for the base and another for the camera, an independent crank riser for additional height, multiple tightening locations to keep your camera in place, and the ability to hold your camera in both landscape and portrait.Since receiving this tripod, I did a ""test"" where I installed my camera and left it alone for almost five days with the legs fully extended and positioning locations locked / secured. This tripod held its position without any trouble, easing my concerns about it falling over and damaging my camera.",5,1,2015-11-29,1,4,1
"I have purchase many AmazonBasics products in the past and was very satisfied with the quality of each of the items I received. The 60-inch lightweight tripod was an exception.  After returning the first tripod because the head couldn’t be secured in place, I received a replacement tripod with the exact same problem. For all you photography buffs. If you try to mount a simple Canon SLR camera equipped with a 1lb Sigma Art lens in front of it, you will notice right away that the camera will tend to tilt forward, regardless of how hard you tighten the plastic knob.I purchased this tripod in order to take night pictures of the Northern Light in Iceland. The AmazonBasic tripod was rendered useless to me when I realized that the tripod head couldn’t stay up right when my camera was mounted on it.",1,1,2018-8-23,1,4,0
Portability: Like the carrying case for it. Everything is light weight and perfect to attach to my bag without the case as well.Structure: Light weight but sturdy enough to hold my camera. The ball swivel feet are great for rougher terrain or uneven surfaces.,5,1,2017-5-18,1,1,1
"I sell products on Etsy, and taking pictures of the products is the bane of my existence.  We had a smaller, 45"" tripod that my husband bought when he bought his camera.  It was so short, and I had to bend so much, that I hated using it and would have a backache for days.  I would put off taking the pictures, and by extension listing the items, as long as I could.So I bought a taller tripod.  It's 60"", and I'm 66"" tall (5'6"").  It is AMAZING, the difference.  I love the multiple spirit levels, all the adjustments, and the hot swap plate especially.  It makes it so much easier to move the camera from the tripod in the living room, where I take the pictures, to the computer in the office, where I edit the pictures.",5,1,2017-1-18,1,1,0
Finally used this tripod for the first time after having it for a year. We took it to Iceland and thank god we did because the aurora borealis appeared and there is no way we could have gotten photographs of it without a tripod. I can't have been more happy that I packed this tripod when I almost took it out of my luggage.The price is so cheap for a tripod in general. The build quality is great. It's sturdy. Even in the Iceland wind the tripod was able to stand its ground.,5,1,2017-9-15,1,7,0
The package comes with a tripod bag and one Tripod made of hard plastic and aluminium. The tripod itself comes with 2 levels one on top of the legs and the other on the head.I liked the first tripod so much that I bought another one. I am still looking for one more tripod and for the price this is a top runner.,5,1,2016-3-6,1,5,0
I absolutely LOVE this tripod. I have no clue how such a versatile tripod can go for so low...but hey just one more reason to LOVE Amazon.com!!As you can see I have no arms so I need a tripod that is lightweight but full on perks...this tripod is EVERYTHING I hoped for & then some!!!!,5,1,2014-1-25,1,4,1
"Bottom line: This is a decent tripod for the money, but it's not great.  If you can afford a better tripod, don't bother with this.This has some really solid components.  The legs themselves are pretty solid and have a great finish. The extensions pull out really nicely and stay in place perfectly.  The feet have little ball joints on the ends so you're always pretty stable regardless of what the ground is like.",2,1,2017-6-19,1,1,0
"As an ""Intermediate"" Photographer, testing the waters in professional/paid photography, I love this tripod! I do mostly nature, street, and portait shots, but I do occasionally do events and sports.  This tripod is great for all of that! It allows me to get a slow enough ShutterSpeed, whether I'm in a lower lighting situation such as a party & don't want to crank up my ISO, or I am doing a landscape shot, and want very creamy, soft, movement. The tripod is very inexpensive- who wants to pay + for brands??? Very lightweight. Easy to transport (comes with a bag). It has so many features! Definitely recomend. I will let you guys know if my opinion on the tripod changes.",5,1,2017-7-27,1,1,1
"I agonized for so long about getting a tripod for my Sony A6000, looking at pricey Manfrottos and the like, totally uncertain about what was best for my amateur video needs. Luckily I stumbled upon a photography review website that explained in lucid English that this simple $20/$25 tripod was basically all one would ever need for shooting in the home, on the beach, at graduation ceremonies, or in other non-demanding environments. They were 100% correct, and I pass this enthusiastic review along to anyone else who might be wondering whether they need the $250 carbon-filament Zomeii or the $500 Manfrotto just to get some video of their cat wandering around the apartment. This tripod is exceptionally stable, easy to lengthen/shorten, and has a super-easy detachable head thingy that, with the flick of a switch, can free your camera for hand-held shooting or for replacing the battery/memory card. I’m sure there are reasons why someone might want a super-high-end ultra-expensive tripod, but unless you have a heavy camera or the need to shoot in mountainous war-zones, I think this tripod is the rare example of a solution that’s not too good to be true. If you just want something to plop your light mirrorless camera on and shoot, this is a fantastic buy.",5,1,2017-1-2,1,1,0
"Haven't had time to learn about pro-tripods and decided to try this entry level thing. All I can say - it proves the name 'Basics'. It's OK for the price if you need to take a couple of family photos, not moreCons:",1,1,2018-4-18,1,5,1
"For less than $25, I got a decent tripod that's reasonably stable, with several nice features.  Each leg has two extensions that will lock at any point along their lengths.  Having  used it only twice at the range, I can't say if the leg locks will continue to hold firm, but for now, the friction is good and the platform is quite stable at any height I can conceive of needing.  As Range Safety Officer, while watching things pretty close, I can also spot for several shooters at a time, sometimes for five hours at a stretch, and I need to stay comfortable.  My spotting scope has an angled eyepiece, so I look down into it -- the tripod can be shorter than I'd need for a straight eyepiece.  I'm 5'10"", and with the legs fully extended I only need to crank up the height adjustment two or three inches to be able to use the scope without bending over at all.  This tripod would be equally comfortable for a person who was 6'5"" or more.In addition to the usual crank-up height adjustment, There are three ""attitude"" adjustments:  a protruding handle lets you swing the scope (or camera) vertically;  a knob lets you pan the scope/camera horizontally;  and a small ""wing-nut"" lets you tilt the scope/camera 90°, but ONLY TO THE RIGHT.  That seemed like a problem at first -- when shooting at a bench, I like the scope to be to the right of the bench, with the angled eyepiece tilted LEFT toward me.  If you'll check my photos, you'll see that I just reversed the scope (it'll mount either way), and tilted it left.",4,1,2018-4-24,1,4,1
"I bought this about 2 years ago, when just starting out on my photography journey, because it was the cheapest one I could find, figuring I'd upgrade to a nicer one eventually. In that time, I've used it a LOT, and when I'm not using it, I leave it in my car, so I always have it when I need it. It gets bumped around, things stacked on top of it, etc, and it's still just as sturdy as the day I bought it. It is an inexpensive tripod, so it's not as sturdy or smooth as some of the more expensive ones, and the legs are fixed, so you can't configure it in the same way as you can with a tripod that has independent legs, but that's rarely been an issue for me. And it really is a whole lot lighter than some of those nicer tripods. I can take this one hiking without a second thought, but I'd hesitate to take some of the more expensive tripods with their fancy heads. There's a whole lot of bang for your buck with this little thing, and I would recommend it to anyone who just needs a simple tripod for their hobby.",5,1,2018-4-20,1,0,0
"It's really not bad, considering the price.  But it has some fatal flaws:- there is too much friction in the plastic-on-plastic joints, which makes the up/down and left/right swivel actions very difficult to fine-tune",3,1,2017-9-28,1,1,0
"It's kind of flimsy in the field but lightweight enough to do the job when all you need is stabilization, such as shooting panoramas or even timelapse ""selfies"" to document a work procedure in stills or video unattended. Two of the rivet-like pins came loose after only a couple of weeks, but they can be replaced with #4-40 bolts if you use aircraft style safety nuts to keep from losing those, too. I'd get a heavier tripod for where rock-solid stability is required due to wind loading or similar things that would shake a camera, or with a longer lens than about 250mm. It jiggles too much in the slightest breeze for time exposures through a telephoto lens, but it gives nice night exposures with shorter lenses if shielded from wind.Good for a lightweight tripod to carry where a high dollar heavy one would be too cumbersome, where if you break or bend it, it's not a huge loss to replace it. It's probably excellent with a lighter weight camera and lens assembly. With the legs fully retracted, it's great on a workbench to photograph repair or assembly procedures when writing a manual. The legs have enough different extension capability to level and stabilize the camera in rugged mountainous terrain to get those special shots that might be impossible to do handheld. Combined with the remote control wireless or wired shutter triggers, you can shoot pro quality scenes on a very low end budget.",3,1,2016-7-20,1,4,0
"I just got this product today, 6/12/17. First impressions I'm very pleased at the quality. I've tested and used all the features and found them to be rock solid. Now something I am surprised at is how many people I saw damage their product with the screw for the camera. I think people are twisting the camera instead of the screw. The screw isn't stationary it's on a loose track and you twist it from the inside to tighten the camera down. YOU DO NOT TWIST THE CAMERA.  I was wondering before I bought why I saw so many damaged devices. I was actually nervous to buy it. I recommend anyone with basic understanding to buy this. It's an amazing product, don't let misguided users effect your decision.Update: It's October 20th, this stand is still going strong. Not a single feature has been damaged. Moderate to heavy use.",5,1,2017-6-12,1,3,0
"When I first saw this tripod I thought It'd be a great solution for long exposure night photography in the city that I work on. Nothing too complex or requiring any extra durability or extreme weather condition usage.Upon first night of using this I loved it and the ability to adjust height with not only the adjustable locking latches (3 on each leg), but also the crankarm for additional height. That first night I did experience that while carrying it in the travel bag it comes with, the zipper to the bag came off as well as the strap and was no longer able to use it. Wasn't too much of an issue because I could still carry the tripod in my hand. The bag seemed to be made of cheap material. No huge loss though.",1,1,2018-11-23,1,2,0
"The last time I bought an inexpensive tripod was probably around 2002. I thought this one would be similar: it was the same price, after all. Not really: it is much lighter, and not as robust. For example, the way the feet are attached is simply a press fit. Somehow I managed to lose one in the first two weeks.It functions OK. It does what it says it does.  But if you are going to use a tripod with any kind of regularity, or travel with it to any extent, I would suggest spending even a little bit more money and getting a more robust tripod.",4,1,2019-12-21,1,1,0
"I bought this to replace a clumsy old tripod that an elderly uncle gave to our grandson with a nice, tough little spotting scope.  Mounting and manipulating the spotting scope was frustrating for him, so I went looking for a quick-connect hookup to upgrade the old tripod.  It was actually cheaper to buy this whole tripod, which has a quick connect adapter.It's not tough construction (like the old tripod) but is easy to use, and should last until it's clear whether grandson will have long term interest that will justify a higher quality (more expensive) tripod.  I did buy the ""insurance"" that was offered at time of purchase, which I seldom do.  In this case, I think that might be a good decision.",4,1,2017-4-16,1,2,0
"UPDATE:  I'm decreasing my rating on this tripod from four stars to two, because it is not durable at all.  In addition to the plastic locking tab that broke off early on (see below), the quick release plate that attaches to the camera body cracked, and was no longer fastening securely to the camera.  I got a warranty replacement tripod from Amazon pretty quickly, which was nice.  However, one of the bolts on the center post slide broke within about a week, and has rendered the replacement tripod completely useless.  The tripod functions fairly well for hobby photography, but at this point, I have to say that the durability is terrible.  I use a tripod fairly often, and so I'm just going to do some research, spend more money, and get myself a much higher quality option.  I recommend you do the same.For the money, this is an excellent tripod. Lots of functions and capabilities, with numerous adjustments that can be made. The two levels are a nice touch. I would give five stars but one of the plastic tabs on one of the legs broke off, so that leg is now a real pain to adjust.",2,1,2017-10-24,1,1,0
"This thing is a real piece of junk.  I bought it solely for using with a small laser level that weighs way less than most any camera.  I assumed any tripod would be able to handle that, as it should.  The adjustment knob for the tilt can't get tight enough to hold it sturdy even when it's wrenched all the way down.  Maybe I received a defective one.  I initiated a return but forgot to drop it in the mail and now it's outside of the return window.  Absolute waste of money, not useful for anything and too large for a paperweight.  I wonder how many of these are in the landfill already.",1,1,2019-6-5,1,1,0
"I've had it for over a year and it works superwell. Good for the price. It is stable and can handle my camera, Canon EOS 7D with a mic on. Easy adjustable and easy to carry around as it is light-weight. It is smooth with horizontal pans for videos. Id be a little carefull with it if pointing camera straight up or straight down, particularly if your camera is heavy, just in case, but i have never had an issue. I have two, and have had no issue with either one. Ive used them on uneven surfaces, outside and for photo and film and it works absolutely great!",5,1,2020-2-29,1,1,1
"Overall I say this little tripod is a great deal! I am sure you can get something better, but at the PRICE it has worked well for us. We have had it now for two years and it is in great shape still. Extremely light weight and, although it might not be the most compact, I still think it is pretty compact in general. We've had our car packed to the brim and have always still found a place to slide this in. Easy to use and perfect if your looking for something to allow you to point and click. A good, basic, tripod.",4,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0
"The good, For the price it is a decent tripod. It is fairly light weight. It is a good basic tripod for still pictures. It is cheap enough if something happens to it you will not mind tossing it out. I would not recommend it for video cameras if you plan to use it for panning across an area because of the friction jerkiness. When panning, at it's lowest friction setting the movement is jerky and not smooth as is found with better tripods. The bad, It took three tries to get a good tripod. The first one purchased through Amazon Warehouse as new, had a broken quick release plate, returned it. Second unit again purchased through Amazon Warehouse, again advertised as new, was missing the quick release plate!!!! Third try, paid the full price, perfect!",4,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0

"After 4 months of light use, one of the legs already has issues.  The thing won't close around the leg and so that leg is always a bit off.Before this issue, it worked fine but issue with the leg started almost immediately after receiving it but finally became a bigger issue now.",1,1,2017-5-29,1,1,1
"When you stream like I do, efficiency, functionality and ease of use are pretty important when using products.  For a LONG time I was quite literally using a small table with books and had my webcam on that.  It was annoying and stupid looking and... well... annoying.I had been eyeing this tripod for a while and decided to just go for it.  It's amazing, awesome, spectacular.  It holds my webcam in place, and still allows me to switch up the settings on the tripod without having to worry about everything else moving too ie; there are a lot of different working parts and while they all work together, they work together on their own.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,2,0
This is supposed to support up to 6 lbs.  I bought my daughter a table top telescope that can be removed from the original stand and mounted on a tripod.  The telescope weighs 3 lbs.  unfortunately it is very difficult to make fine adjustments to positioning on this tripod.  when ever I would lock in the vertical adjustment it would then drop down a little making it almost impossible to point the telescope.  I tried to tighten up the screw a little more and then it just broke so you couldn't use it any more.  Thankfully Amazon makes returns easy these days.  Took it to Kohl's and dropped it off and even got a 25% off coupon to use so there was something good to come of it.,1,1,2019-8-23,1,3,0
"Had previously bought a cheap tripod for my cellphone (as I don't even own a straight up camera). Worked ok but was a bit flimsy and not quite high enough. Saw this one and it looked a lot more sturdy so I decided to get it. To use this with my cellphone, I also had to buy a separate adapter to mate the cellphone to this tripod. Got both parts at the same time and tried everything out with my cellphone. Compared to my other tripod, this one is a rock. Holds my phone steady so making videos with it is pretty easy. Has all the adjustments I need to put the cellphone in any position I want in either landscape or portrait mode. Goes about a foot higher than my other one. The only knock I can give to this tripod is the swivel from side to side was way too tight even with adjustment all the way loose. It took both hands to turn from side to side cause you had to hold the tripod steady with one hand cause the tripod would move as you turned. Took me awhile to keep turning it around and around (like about 500 times) for it to loosen up where I could use it with one hand. Took off a star for that but other than that, this tripod is working very well for me. I plan on basically using this in the house or outside in the backyard and this will last me forever. It's not a professional tripod but I'm not a professional so it's fine. This tripod does everything I need it too. Can't beat the price either.",4,1,2019-2-2,1,2,0
The reviews on this product is a little suspect.  Without the camera the tilt function is abnormally loose. It can not tighten. Very cheaply made. I am too nervous to put anything on long. I may try to use it for one of my monitors or lights but it is certainly something that I will not recommend.,1,1,2017-4-3,1,1,1
"We got our grandson a Celestron Landscout Spotting Scope, which he loves for night sky viewing. (Much better option than a low end kid telescope.) The Scope comes with a nice tabletop tripod, but that doesn't help if you're standing at the end of the driveway at night. This tripod was the perfect complement to that scope.As expected, the scope mounted without difficulty. The scope weighs in at over a pound, but that was no challenge for this tripod. Adjustments were logical and could easily be made by the kid. Loosening the mount, moving the scope around, and retightening were not a problem. Mechanism wasn't too tight. Legs weren't a problem. Stability was quite good. The carry case is handy. Adjustable height made the tripod very kid friendly.",5,1,2017-1-10,1,8,0
"This thing is awesome.  Low cost, sturdy enough for light weight items, easy to use, great features.  Details:Our uses: I used it to hold a laser level while redoing our living room subfloor.  This has a 2 way bubble level mounted in the lower frame, and a crank to raise & lower it - really made laser setup a breeze.  I can pan horizontally with almost no vertical shift.  Now my wife uses it to hold her phone as a webcam for Zoom meetings - nice and stable.",5,1,2020-4-12,1,1,0
"I had high hopes for this even though it's a really inexpensive tripod. I saw all the positive reviews and decided to buy one. Unfortunately, I'm reminded of the old adage, ""Buy once, cry once.""I bought it to use with a spotting scope and it is well within the tripod's weight rating. As soon as I tried to lock my spotting scope down, I noticed the head sagged so much, I could barely see my target 125 yards away. Basically, I had to put the top of my viewing area at the bottom of a 36 inch target to get it to center-up once I tightened everything down. I was really disappointed in that, and I'll be returning it. I'll just suck it up and drop the cash on a more expensive tripod.",2,1,2018-4-9,1,2,0
"Upon opening the box, I heard a rattle. A little bit concerned, I pulled out the tripod bag and unzipped it to find the tripod inside a plastic bag within the carrying bag. Upon turning it upside down to slide the tripod out, a washer, a nut, and a long black handle fell out of the bag along with the tripod. I looked for instructions. Not finding any, I had to look up the tripod picture here on Amazon to see what it was supposed to look like. Well.. the long black handle is supposed to be attached (and not come off) and is used for panning and tilting the camera while it is mounted to the tripod. When I tried to screw mine back in, it just falls back out.. it is like the screw is stripped or something. I am returning it and will spend money on something sturdier and better made. I have an expensive camera, and I don't want the camera to fall off and get damaged due to a cheap tripod that could easily break. Disappointed.",1,1,2020-6-15,1,1,0
"Great product so far. I own two businesses and I use social media as my marketing/branding platforms and I’ve used at least 5 other tripod before this one for business.Figuring out what works and doesn’t work, what I need and what I don’t want, these have been learnt through my experience.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
I had this replaced after the first one didn't work out because one of the hinges would not tighten all the way no matter how had I twisted the knob. I wasn't able to stabilize the camera as it would just loosen and tip lens first downwards.  The replacement I was sent did the same exact thing.,1,1,2016-9-11,1,1,0
"The tripod that we had was quite a few years old, which we got as part of a camera kit. During a recent photo shoot one of the legs came off and we decided that it was time to find a replacement. We came across this tripod while searching and thought it should be decent based on the number of stars.This tripod is put together well, with sturdy legs, connectors and 2 levels. The legs are easy to extend and feature feet that can turn to most surfaces. The camera mount stem can easily be raised and lowered, using the crank, and tightened in place, by tightening the round fastener just above the top of the legs. There is also a fastener at the base of the main cylinder to lock the legs into their extended position, just above the hook for a weight. The overall height of this tripod with a DSLR attached to it when fully extended is just a little too much for someone that is 6’2” while standing up straight and needs to be lowered just a little bit. Basically, this should work for just about everyone, in regards to the height. The attached handle makes it easier to manipulate the tripod without any fear of pinching your skin in the process of setting up or taking it down. The included carrying case makes it convenient to store and transport, keeping it clean while not in use.",5,1,2018-11-4,1,1,1
"I'm past the window when I can get technical support or a replacement, and yet, I've barely used it in the time I've had it and it already broke. The little handle that you use to screw the quick release plate into the camera or iphone stand completely came apart and now a major part of this tripod doesn't work. Really disappointed. It works fine otherwise. It's very light, so in some cases that's great, in others it's not because you loose some stability. The levers and whatnot work fine, but they're clearly low quality. Everything is just a bit ""eh.""",1,1,2019-9-14,1,2,1
"For a simple tripod this is the best tripod we've used.  The tripod is sturdy and offers intuitive simplicity even for a novice photographer.  We use this mostly for family photo shoots.  All of the knobs and grips tighten and snap into place accordingly.  We've had this tripod for a few months now and we use it at least once a week and everything still works like the day we bought it. The telescoping legs aren't flimsy and slide in and out with ease. We've had issues in the past with the swivels and knobs loosening over time, or aluminum legs bending easily but so far this one has held up better than others. The bag is pretty standard but it fits the tripod accordingly, and is sturdy enough to be lugged around in the back of our car for the past few months without tearing.  There are obviously better and more expensive tripods available that have more features and perhaps a better build quality, but overall if you're not doing any upper echelon level photograph (or even if you are) I'd recommend this tripod based on price point and build quality.  You won't find a better bargain for a quality tripod than this one.",5,1,2017-3-21,1,1,0
"It didn't take a lot of time after receiving this, my first tripod, to decide that mounting a camera on a tripod opens up many new abilities when taking snapshots as well as when recording video. It's that third arm you need to keep everything pointed correctly. This tripod in unison with a remote shutter control has made everything much easier and it's showing better results. It's a natural for providing a solid positioning for vloggers when facing and speaking into their cameras.This inexpensive plastic tripod should not be quickly written off as some would do. It provides a huge amount of service for its meager price, for example when multi cameras are being used at different angles. Indeed it mimics everything an expensive tripod does, but this one works perfectly under a light workload, freeing up the more versatile equipment for better use when it is needed elsewhere.",5,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0
"I just got into DSLR photography and everyone advises you to get an expensive tripod. Personally I think that's a load of crap. When it comes down to it a tripod is a tripod and this is a great buy. With 2 separate leveling bubbles to level the stand and a decent swivel this tripod is a steal for $20. I'm 6'1"" and when fully extended this tripod brings the viewfinder on my Nikon D5100 at almost exactly eye-level so it works good for me. No this isn't going to be the strongest most sturdy tripod you'll ever find but personally I dont throw my tripod into rocks or try to tackle it so it works just fine for me. The legs extend effortlessly and the locks on the legs seem to be of decent quality as I haven't had them slip or sink down at all.Also comes with a nice handle for moving it around while you're shooting. The top extension does drop a little if it's not tightened right away if your camera is heavy or you're using a heavy lens. But that's not really a big issue for me as I crank it up and just tighten it right away. If you're super picky this might be a problem for you but in all reality it's no big deal. The feet of the tripod have nice pivots to get an even stance when on the ground.",3,1,2013-3-4,1,1,0
"For the cost, which was a little over $23 at the time I got it, this is a good tripod.  It isn't great, but it will get the job done for most users I think.  I've been a big fan of AmazonBasics products over the years, and this is the first one that I sort of questioned when I first started messing with it.The plastic feels like it could be a little weak at places like the clips and knobs.  Nothing has broken yet, in the limited use I have given it, but I am being very careful as I adjust things.  But so far everything has worked how I'd expect.  The quick-release plate is very easy to take on and off, and seems firm so far.  I am using a small Handycam, which isn't very heavy.  I have not tried it with my wife's DSLR, which would be much heavier with a big lens on it.  We'll see.",4,1,2018-9-4,1,1,0
"I love this tripod. I am a film maker and I use really robust tripods on a daily basis. This is not that, but it is not advertised as that. It is a very basic light weight phone rig tripod and it is really amazing considering what it is. The price is right and I have been using it for my zoom meetings and teaching my online ZOOM class. It has a lot of great adjustments on it as well as a bullseye level on the bottom of the head. It has worked flawlessly for me over the past 3 months! Love it. If it broke tomorrow I would buy another one.  Anyone who has an issue with it or doesnt like it is most likely expecting a 12 hundred dollar tripod for 23 bucks!! Good luck. I use an I-Phone 11 with a handle bar frame and external shotgun mic. that screws right in to the 1/4 screw on the head.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I purchased this tripod over 2 1/2 years ago, and am personally impressed at how well it has held up. I have never used a ""professional"" grade tripod, and therefore cannot compare it to brands like Manfrotto. However, I can speak to its functionality from a beginning photographer standpoint. The only thing that this tripod can't properly execute, is pan shots for video. For that, you would need a tripod with a fluid head. For typical photography, this tripod has served me through many shots of running rivers and waterfalls, portrait photography, and was invaluable when I photographed the solar eclipse last year. To also attest to this product, would be the support I received from Amazon. A couple of months ago, I began to have issues with one of the legs no longer locking properly. I contacted Amazon to see if there was some way to fix this, and they sent me a brand new tripod. I have never regretted purchasing this tripod.",5,1,2018-1-6,1,6,1
"It came Broken and I had it shipped to Trinidad 🇹🇹 for an event I needed it for 😢😢😢😢 . To send it back to the States then wait for a new one  too expensive and I didnt have enough time !!! So heart broken ... whyyyyyy whyyyyyy !!!!!The actual product is wonderful made , nice carry bag . This hurts sooo badly 😢😢",1,1,2018-5-4,1,5,1
This tripod is exactly what I was looking for. It is definitely light but not so much that it feels like cheap crap . It just wont kill your shoulders/arms carrying it places.I really love the added in levelers and how much the legs and neck for the tripod can extend. Also the carrying bag is a really nice addition so I can keep the tripod stored and protected well enough when I'm not using it.,5,1,2019-3-2,1,1,0
"This looks like a solid tripod at a great price. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver. It is so light that it doesn't do much to stabilize the camera or scope mounted on it. I bought this to mount a spotting scope to see bullet holes at the shooting range. However, the tripod would shake so much in the slightest breeze that I couldn't see the target clearly. Even a strong hand on top of the scope didn't stabilize it. The tripod does have a hook on the bottom of the column, and I'm sure if I hung a bag of rocks on the hook that would help. But, that's a bigger hassle than just using a heavier tripod.This tripod is good for selfies and that's about it.",2,1,2017-10-9,1,2,0
"After reading some of the negative reviews saying that its just a flimsy plastic stand, I was pleasantly surprised after spending some time setting it up this afternoon. I found that it has some good features and it working for my portrait photo project. Theres many ways to adjust and tweak the stand until you get it right and it is very lightweight. I dont think its the best one best on the price point and that probably does reflect the quality overall, but i like it. Its basic and yet sturdy and cheap enough for beginners and gets the job done. Do recommend if you're not looking for anything extremely professional .",4,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0
"I returned this mainly because the motion was nowhere near fluid.  Especially panning.  You could not pan smoothly because it would bind.  Since my main application was taking video, this was unacceptable.  Trying to make MINOR adjustments to panning were difficult because it would fight you trying and then when it did give, you'd go too far.  If I was stuck with this tripod I maybe would have soaked the head in WD40 or something to try to loosen it up, but it wasn't worth the effort.  It IS a cheap tripod, I know that, and it checks a lot of the boxes when it comes to tripod requirements.  If you just need something to hold your camera and you don't think you'll be particular about where your camera is pointing...then maybe this is your tripod.",3,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
First things first! The price of this tripod is absolutely a winner here in my book. Any beginner photographer is going to need a tripod for either long exposures or time-lapse and if you do any video work it will help to keep the camera stable. Here are some other Pros for the Tripod.1. The Build,5,1,2018-8-8,1,1,0
"I loved this tripod and used it heavily for long exposures all around my city for a couple weeks. Then one of the lower black latches that holds one of the legs broke off and I've had to fidget with it since to make sure it's stable, though this may also be due to all the dirt and bangs its been exposed to over a relatively short time.That said, I still find this an exceptional value. I was up on a hill in high wind with this and it stayed perfectly steady with no stabilizer hooked to the bottom. It has 2 levels, a 360 level for the stand itself and a level to judge the mounting base by. Multiple levers and knobs which control or stabilize vertical and horizontal panning. Sleek design. Lightweight for its size and overall an incredible value. I didn't hesitate to buy another one at this cheap price to meet me ahead at the destination when I left for a winter trip. It ended up being a great tripod in the snow as well!",5,1,2017-12-30,1,1,0
"I purchased this tripod to hold a spotting scope at shooting matches and practice at the rifle range. I'm honestly impressed, especially with the price and simple features. I've seen tripods at sporting good stores that easily cost twice as much and are exactly the same thing.The tripod folds up and is stored neatly in an included case. The case is fine for transport and carrying around, but if you're flying on a plane or transporting it somewhere it might get dropped or have other items dropped on it, I'd say get something more substantial. A little waterproofing and the bag should be just fine outdoors in the rain.",5,1,2018-1-1,1,1,0
"I bought this for a gift.  I had ample time to test it before I gave it away.I consider this to be a starter tripod for someone new to photography to see if they would want a better tripod.  Good tripods are expensive.  Before buying an expenisve tripod, I wanted to see if the person to whom I gifted this item would even use a triopod.",3,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0
"This is my second purchase of this tripod.  I really like them but the clamps that hold the sliding legs fail too frequently.  So it would be a five star rating, but crappy engineering or materials result in failure after awhile.  I use these about 3 times a week to record videos of community events.  So, seek a better quality tripod, or bite the bullet, use it, and prepare to have to purchase a replacement in 1-2 years.  I think they are using substandard plastic that doesn't hold up long in the clamps.",3,1,2018-7-31,1,2,0
"Great tripods. Unless you have a giant multi pound TV new crew camera, these will work for most other needs.The build quality is there. The legs are sturdy. The plastic parts are thick and strong feeling. There is nothing new in this unit's design. I had something very similar (but less sturdy feeling) 25 years ago. Classic design built well with a good price.",5,1,2018-8-22,1,1,0
"The best 'budget' level Tripod available: fairly rugged, and has proved useful for both camera, webcam, and VR use.The mounting plate system is easy to use, though if you're like me, You'll probably want to pick up extra mounts for the rest of your devices you plan to mount to it.",5,1,2016-12-21,1,3,0
"A camera tripod has been on my Amazon wish list basically ever since I bought my fancy camera back in December 2014.  But for some reason I’ve just kept it there.  I’ve been worried about getting a cheap one and it breaking my camera or something.I don’t know people, I am not a camera savvy gal- I’m strictly a wannabe in this area.  I’m researching a ton and learning a lot though; that counts for something, right?",5,1,2015-10-20,1,7,1
"Aside from being taller, this tripod is of *much* better construction quality than its 50"" smaller sibling, while still remaining lightweight. I'm 6'1"" and this tripod works great for me when expanded to its full height with my D3400 mounted on it. It's plenty sturdy to hold the D3400 and keep it steady in more or less whatever position you want. I haven't had any problems with it slipping in any of its axes that I can recall. I used it extensively during a trip to Hawaii and Asia and also some on a trip to Yellowstone and it has held up fine, so far.While it's plenty sturdy, the aluminum construction also makes it light. It's easy to carry comfortably over my shoulder with the included case. Carrying it and my camera bag around was no problem at all, even while doing some light hiking on a few occasions.",5,1,2017-11-3,1,2,0
"Great for beginners or folks that just need something simple to hold their camera steady. I use my smartphone for filming and this is great at keeping it steady without breaking the bank. And at 60"" tall, it's about the right height for matching up with my eye level. Check out my video review.",5,1,2017-3-4,1,1,0
I picked this up to shoot videos with a cell phone.  It is a perfectly good tripod - perhaps a little too lightweight for some applications but it works well for what we needed.  It pairs very well with a cell phone holder that is also available on Amazon!  My problem with this tripod is that when a friend put it back in its case they unscrewed the steering handle completely which disengaged the washer and nut from the threads.  I'm not sure how to assemble it again because the housing doesn't seem to come apart and there is no apparent way to get pliers inside to hold the nut in place.  Not the product's fault - just a cautionary tale for other folks to NOT completely unscrew the handle!,4,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"I wanted a basic tripod for some quick shots unattended and thought to get this tripod as it was cheap and (based on other reviews) seemed to get the job done. It’s certainly no frills with a handful of interesting features.First off, it’s tall. At 60”, it’s no joke and really helps to get all the shots you need. Second, it’s easy to operate. The knobs make sense for what you want to do and the screwing/unscrewing part is easy to handle. Third, the carrying case is nice. Fourth, the built-in level helps you to get those nice, even shots. Fifth, the leg extensions are smooth and slide out very easily. The feet at the bottom are also movable (ball joints) based on the surface so that’s very nice.",4,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
"I was thoroughly impressed with this tripod. It is light and allows for various angles using my DSLR or monocular. The adjustments are all plastic but they stay once set. The only thing is that it because it is light, you might want to weigh it down with something if you're in a place with wind [or even if not, you don't want someone to knock it over and have your expensive equipment come crashing into the ground]. There is a nice hook at the bottom for that, and you can hang your backpack there once you've set it up to its permanent position. Really great height too, once you've expanded all the legs. Nothing to complain, I don't see myself ever wanting to upgrade this tripod. This will do.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"Tripod received appears to be adequate and should function sufficiently if handled with care.The Plastic used for this product seems hard, giving the impression it might snap easily at some point. Only time will tell.",3,1,2017-12-25,1,2,0
"Oh wow this tripod is amazing!!! I didn’t think much of an inexpensive tool to use for car pics, landscapes, monuments.  One of my favorite features is the feet that they will set flat in any condition. I also like that the mount for the camera is removable since I attached my holder to the mount and as a set they fit with the rest of the tripod in the bag. For those difficult because someone won’t move out of your pic, there’s the manual center pole that can go up almost 2 feet.So we field tested this in many different locations: asphalt, mud, muddy grass, trees, just feet from a buffalo, and the setup was in seconds!",5,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0
"Pros: Inexpensive, plenty of adjustments, built-in levels, good for basic useCons: On the heavier side, adjustments are not that smooth, can be wobbly",4,1,2016-1-11,1,1,0
Very impressed with this tripod. Thick metal legs with extension locks and plastic turret mount that is easily adjusted and lockable in all 3 axes. Has robust plastic carrying handle affixed to one leg.Comes with an adequately sized zippered cloth carrying case.,4,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"it's a much needed step up if you purchase a cheaper telescope for star gazing or range spotter scope, usually a lot better than the plastic cheap ones those products come with. I bought  Celestron scope and this made it a bit more usable to gaze at the moon and definitely helps shooting at the desert or the range. The only downsize is the handle you hold onto and tighten to lock in place is all hard plastic and depending on the weight of the scope and angle it moves over short periods of time unless you really tighten it down which you must be careful not to break.. I wish it would have been of aluminum or steel to lock it but hey for $20 it's better than what i had prior and much more stable.",4,1,2018-8-4,1,1,0
"1) First of all, built like a tank for sturdiness but amazingly light.  2) love the two level indicators. 3) gear heads would love the flexibility and multuple adjustments designed into this tripod.  Hooks, handles, rotating hand turn raiser thing (hand crank) that bends out of the way when you store it.  The ease of the adjustment of the legs, the ability to crank the height reliably up to my eye site (I'm 6ft), to the ball bearing self adjusting feet.... and 4) lastly, it amazes me how small this collapses to in size.  You would never guess that this tall sturdy tripod fits into a small skinny bag that comes with it. Absolutely love it.  Best tripod I have ever had for both portability and ruggedness.  Great design.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I opened this outside my apartment and took it outside the box as I have been doing since this Covid-19 thing has been going on, then after making sure the box is empty I dispose of it outside, then I bring the tripod into my apartment and pull it our of the carrying case and realize that it does not have a mounting plate attached and so I reach inside the carrying case thinking it may be inside but instead I find a foot that is broken off!There was zero papers accompanying the thing, no little card explaining anything, nothing, no papers what so ever! In this time I am not going out to stand in a line and risk COVID-19 at a UPS or a USPS to send it back , so I have to eat the money and just be angry.",1,1,2020-6-2,1,0,1
"I've been looking for this god-forsaken tripod for the past 2 years! I owned one back in I believe 2014? and it was broken by a sibling a few years later, I replaced it with a pricier tripod back in 2016, only to find out the more expensive tripod did not have tilt capabilities... every good portrait needs a sense of DEPTH! it's been collecting dust in my trunk since the day I bought it because of that. Finally decided to search for ""TILT TRIPOD"" instead of just TRIPOD (I'm an idiot, I know) and found the exact one I had from before. I completely forgot the brand was AmazonBasics, which is probably why I couldn't find it when I was looking for it (I use my husband's account now, and I couldn't find this tripod in my old order history probably because I ordered it EONS ago). It's being delivered tomorrow and I'm SO excited! I really hope the quality hasn't waned over the years. I'll update this review if it has, but I'm betting on the quality of Amazon products, they have yet to fail me! Attached is a shameless selfie, using this incredibly versatile tripod!",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,1
"Construction is better than expected for the price.  Nice aluminum legs, great functionality.But, I completely removed the handle (that swivels the camera up/down) once for packing, and it would not screw back in (I tried many a time).  So the unit sat broken/unusable for a few years.  Without the swivel, any placed camera would just fall over (up or down).",4,1,2019-3-11,1,0,0
"I needed stability for an event I was asked to take pics at and this had a really good price so I decided to try it out. It's lightweight but still fairly sturdy, and very easy to set up right out of the box. The only thing I would maybe watch out for is to make doubly sure your legs are completely stable because it's easy to set this up and have it be a little wobbly without extra caution. But that is fixable, just a matter of paying extra attention to how you're set up really. I can't speak to the longevity of this or how it would hold up to constant, everyday use but for now it seems to be decent for a casual photographer. For the price, it really can't be beat.",4,1,2018-8-21,1,1,0
"I have 17 of these for fireworks firing modules, and one I use for cameras. The largest camera I would put on this would be a DSLR with a kit lens, that’s its max capability. It’s great for holding an iPhone or iPad, consumer camcorder, point and shoot, and binoculars. It’s inexpensively constructed, not at all robust. I actually modified it to accept a ball head and here’s why. It has the spreader legs. I hate the tripods without them. And ALL the high end photo tripods don’t have spreader legs. If you want to move the tripod quickly, the spreader legs let you do that. Just pick it up and set it down and it’s deployed and secure. With the expensive tripods, and I have several, you have to redeploy all three legs and make sure they are fully spread out every time you move the tripod. PIA! However for heavier and expensive gear you must use these high end tripods, and I do. But for lighter gear this Amazon Basic 60” surely fills the bill. You must be careful nothing heavy is allowed to rest or fall on it in transport. It’s not tough enough for that. Let it be the LAST thing you load, so it goes on top.",4,1,2018-11-7,1,1,0
"I recently purchased my first DSLR and knew I needed a tripod. I picked this one up before heading out on a 7500 mile, month-long road trip. This tripod proved indispensable!First, my wife and I generally resort to unfavorable 'selfies' when we take trips. The tripod solved that issue! We stopped at each state sign we passed, quickly setup the tripod (which is a breeze), set the 10s timer and took our photo. We could do this whole process in just a minute or two it was so easy.",5,1,2016-8-3,1,2,0
"Everything works well, this is exactly what an inexpensive well designed tripod should be.  It has just enough leveling features that made it helpful for me when using with my laser level.  The quick clamps made it a easy to set-up perfectly in many different positions.  The only thing I didn’t like was there were two different locks that effected the pan.  The top of the legs has a locking mechanism for the height, and locking it on and off always rotated the column side to side.  On the very top is another lock to correct the issues. The workaround for me was to always get height first, then work on left to right.  That is not the best, but everything else about this was great.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"This at first seemed like a good tripod.  It's easily adjustable, and the head allows for easy maneuvering of the spotting scope.  But it's just not rigid enough to dampen vibrations, so it doesn't hold the scope still enough for good viewing.  For the price, I guess I shouldn't have expected more.  But if you want a good tripod for viewing wildlife through a scope, pay more and get something more solid.",2,1,2018-12-2,1,2,0
"I like it. It works great with my Nikon Coolpix b500. Don't know about a DSLR though. What I do not like is it is not smooth at all when moving to right or left or up or down trying to find my birds. I use it for wildlife. So I'm sure it's easier to use with one's family or objects that co-operate, I bought it for times my yard is full of birds & my arm starts to shake. Forget it. I dont know it wD-40 would work.. haha. Seriously though, when you move the long handle it ""over"" turns. Maybe I'm just weak. But if I want it to move just a hair, it dont budge so I try to nudge it a tiny but harder and it moves over way too far!!! Its just not smooth. Maybe it's just me or just mine. I dont know. So it's been in the closet. Back to leaning elbow up against something again. It was a nice thought!",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"This is a great piece. While I have nothing to compare it to, it's very easy to use, even for a beginner like myself. It's got SO many levels and knobs on it, so you can always make sure you have a level shot. My only complaint is that it didn't come with any instructions, so using it was trial and error, although it's fairly straight forward. I'm not sure if none of them come with instructions or if it was just mine, but it would still be helpful, in the event that there are some features I'm missing out on. Can't beat the price, and it serves its purpose for me.",5,1,2017-11-5,1,2,0
"I do not recommend going cheap on this kind of item but if you rarely expect to use it, then it is a good enough buy for the price.A part of it broke and now there isnt a strong hold on the swivel part of the top so I can keep the camera at a certain point but if I touch it lightly it will move out of place. This break doesnt even make sense because I didnt do anything to deserve the break.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Purchased the 60-inch on sale when the price dropped to $23.49.The tripod itself is very lightweight and portable, even when fully extended.  The materials feel solid despite how light it is, and can take minor bumps comfortably.  It held position against moderate wind gusts at high elevations, and comes with a hook that you could attach an anchor to for added weight.  It also collapses quickly, and fits inside of a protective bag which is included.  The two bubble levels and swivel feet help you get the positioning you desire without wasting much time.  As with other tripods, it comes with a detachable mount and side grip.",5,1,2017-7-4,1,1,0
"Very light and strong. You can stick your camera on it and have it tightened down in under 10 seconds and be aiming your camera at something that probably won't sit still for you anyway. I like the bag it comes with. It is stronger than I thought it would be so not worried about it ripping anytime soon.Look, it really is made well. It looks nice. It comes with a bag. It's a strong bag. It is easy to use. It likes long walks on the beach and candlelight dinners. Your new stand might be shy at first but give it time to warm up to you. Either way I think you and your new stand will have a nice long life together.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Works great for the photographer with a crappy DSLR. As an amateur, it works well with what I need to do with it. In low lighting, it's nice to have when you set the shutter speed to low. I also use this for group photos along with a remote. For how much it costs, it's definitely the basics of basics. There's some small things that make it great, like the leveler. It bothers me when pictures aren't straight as an original and having to adjust it on the computer makes the quality lessen. Another great small thing they have is the quick clip. It attaches to your camera, and when you want to put it on the tripod, it only takes a mere second to attach. It also comes with a bag!I put it as 4 stars because the plastic bits are kind of fragile and cracked to the point where the rod-thing that adjusts the angle of the camera keeps falling off and the camera doesn't hold it's position as well.",4,1,2017-10-22,1,1,0
"The AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod functions about as well as you could ask for an entry level tripod. Finding level is fairly easy and the tripod itself is light enough to bring with you when shooting. The mounting plate seems a bit easier to use than those on some other inexpensive tripods.The primary reason that it is getting a low score (2 stars as of 4/2018) is because there seem to be some quality control issues. The first tripod that was shipped to me broke on the second time that I took it out shooting. One of the plastic slips that secure latches for the legs snapped meaning that the leg would extend, but would not stay in place. So far, I haven't had the same issue on the replacement that was shipped to me, but I would be hesitant to recommend this tripod to others without letting them know about this first.",2,1,2018-4-9,1,1,0

"I must say, for $26 and change, you get two of these and the build is pretty nice for the money. It’s sturdy enough for intermediate use of a photographer or videographer that works inside. It had nice height to it, 5 feet total, in my opinion that’s perfectly fine for my needs. Has a nice plastic handle so you can carry with ease if you are going from location to location. You can adjust he legs easily with 2 height setting on the legs and the feet swivel cause they are on balls. And the bottom even comes with a hook, it’s nice for me cause I can hang it on the ceiling when I make drum videos.All in all, this is a fairly sturdy tripod for the money and it comes with a nice carrying bag. You can easily find sturdier ones but you can’t beat 2 of these for $26, takes care of all my photography needs.",5,1,2017-12-30,1,1,1
"I will start by saying that I am just starting to use my Nikon d3200. I needed a tripod to use while at my son's soccer games. I have this one a shot based off of reviews. I'm not sorry. The legs have 2 different extensions that adjust from 2.5 to 5.5 feet.  The knobs are all tight and secure, as well as the mounting clip. I feel that the weight is held very well and I don't worry about tipping. The only things I don't like about it, are the spacer bars on the legs feel very flimsy, and I can see them bending. I also wish that instead of one hook on the bottom there was a triple hook to hang various things from. Overall, it's been a great tripod for me so far!",4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0

"Amazon did a great job creating a quality product at a very fair cost! I am very happy with this purchase.

It's the first time I've seen this and from what I can tell it's fine except that it's a little more time consuming from the traditional method and at times, when I put weight to the camera, the cranking function allows for some unwanted ""sinking."" Taking HDR photos, there's been a few times where it's caused me to have to retake photos due to movement or difference of perspective.",5,1,2016-12-5,1,1,0
"The tripod arrived VERY quickly, it is an amazign value for under 25 dollars.  This is a perfect intoductory tripodThe cons: a little wobbly if you use a larger lens/body set up",4,1,2016-12-28,1,0,0
"I was looking for a not-so-expensive and well-made tripod to hold my Canon EOS 60D for university courses. I browsed and browsed and came across this one by Amazon, initially skeptical because of low-price but still purchased due to good reviews. I've been using it for four months and it has yet to let me down!It holds my heavy camera four feet above the ground, the material is sturdy/tough, it comes with a balance bubble (I forget what it's actually called), and so long as you use some common sense you'll be able to set it up safely and quickly.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"I ordered this tripod quite sceptical, previously I ordered another Amazon basics tripod, that broke. As soon as I opened the box, I was plessently surprised by the overall construction of the unit. From the (seemingly) anodized aluminum, to the overall construction of the plastic pieces, I was quite satisfied. The fact that it arrived in one piece, was surprising considering the lack of any sort of packaging material. Concidering the ""emense care"" in place from the local delivery people, that certainly aided my confidence in the construction. I didn't realize, until this point, that is had a crank to raise the camera. This super useful, it helps you smoothly pan the camera vertically for some exquisite b-roll. Oh right, the head. It's okay for the price. The plastic binds, making a smooth pan difficult. It has a level, which is useful for ensuring you don't have a sideways shot. But if you want that sideways shot, you can. When the screw is tight, the rotation adjustment has discrete steps, and if you loosen it, it becomes linear. The leg adjustment feel sturdy with little to no give, and the feet swivel to match the angle of the ground. For this price, I could not find another tripod with around same features. All in all this product has excellent bang for the buck, and should last.",5,1,2018-4-25,1,0,0
"Great quality. Durable. Fantastic Value.Now I'm new to the DSLR game. Got the camera and then realized I would need so many more accompanying accessories. SD cards, bags, lenses, etc. Not a cheap hobby. When I went to search for Tripods, I was surprised by how expensive some of them were. It's basically metal and plastic, why's it so bloody expensive?! Upset, I went to see what the cheaper options were. Now this part is IMPORTANT. If you're a noob like me this is crucial. The cheaper tripods, basically the 50 inch ones at the tier lower than this, are utter garbage. Read the reviews. They're slightly cheaper but basically guaranteed to break after a few uses. Those tend to be built using mainly weak plastic. Even Amazon's 50inch seems to just be a rebranded Chinese version that everyone makes. They all have basically identical product listings and terrible reviews for the most part. You've got a fairly expensive camera, you don't want that to break to pieces just to save a few bucks.",5,1,2016-3-31,1,2,0
"Lightweight, easy to use. I have never had any problems with my AmazonBasics Tri-Pod. It is very easy to use, comes with a travel bag, and is super lightweight. It comes with a hook if you need to ut a weight on it during windy days and it also has a level to get your photos or videos super straight. As it is 60 inches you can get really tall shots if need be. I have been using it for about a year now and I love it. It does everything a tri-pod is supposed to do without any of the extra fuss. Great for Travel!",5,1,2017-10-16,1,3,0
"This is a good, inexpensive tripod that works very well when the photographer is using the camera hands-on.  However, if you want to set up a shot and step away, the camera will droop if you have even a modest zoom lens attached.  The tripod cannot handle the torque on its own.  So if what you want is something that will help steady your picture, this will work well.  But if you want to use it with a heavy camera and/or zoom lens, I recommend purchasing a more substantial tripod.",3,1,2018-11-19,1,1,0
"this is a great inexpensive tripod. I was looking to spend $150-200 for a better tripod. I could not decide all the reviews had problems, so I decided to take a chance on this tripod until I decide what I really want in a tripod. So happy I bought this one. It has been great and just was I needed for now.

"The good news. It arrived today and it was much better quality than I expected for this price point. I just wanted something to use occasionally when on the road. This one looks like it will be pretty durable. Another thing is that it came with a very nice and well made carry/storage bag. Thick cloth and good zipper. That I hadn't hoped for.On another note, it's a bit more substantial than I expected. I was looking for something very 'slight' and light in weight. This is really nice but being better than I expected it's also a little bulkier than I expected. I ordered a cheap tripod to get a light one and ended up with a pretty substantial one instead. A good point if you were looking for that.",5,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"This is not a top quality fully, 360 degrees on 3 axis tripod, but it is basic, and will get the job done, It had good reviews. It is basically sturdy and the materials are good quality. It is not able to fully adjust the level of the camera. Hence a 1 star deduction. The big draw back is, you have to remove the mounting platform to screw the tripod to the camera. A rather stupid design. But for the price, it will hold the camera still But will still bend and twist when the shutter button is depressed. Good basic tripod for the money and is most likely much better than others in this price range.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Third times a charm! I received two broken tripods with nuts and pieces falling off, very frustrating. However, the tripod seemed to be a decent quality for the price with a year warranty, so I gave it one more chance. Finally on the third one, it was in a plastic bag and in perfect condition. I do really like it. Its my first tripod and seems to do the job well and has a ton of movement features. It just took so long to get it right, Im a little concerned about the longevity of the item.",3,1,2018-1-31,1,2,0

"Fabulous tripod.  I own an expensive, heavy, multiple function tripod, however I was going on a trip to Finland to try and photograph the Northern Lights and didn't want to hassle with my standard tripod.  Purchased this one looking for something light weight that I could take on the trip.  Didn't expect much due to the cost and was extremely, pleasantly surprised.  Great little, light weight, full size tripod.  Fit diagonally in my checked luggage and didn't put me over my baggage limits.  Strong and durable enough to hold my Nikon D7200 with a large lens without losing its position.  Highly recommend.",5,1,2018-3-1,1,1,0
"I liked this tripod, very lightweight and sleek looking. However, the one of the clasps that holds a leg in place was only held in by a very thin, cheap part that broke within 2 months. It still works, but the leg falls out and has to be mounted delicately.I didn't expect much, considering the price. Still, would have been nice to get more than just 2 months out of the thing.",1,1,2019-4-15,1,3,1
"I thought this would be a temporary tripod because my expensive, PRO tripod I use with my Nikon SLR broke. Nope, I am still using this nice and low priced tripod.Amazon has this great way of taking expensive items, like shredders or in this case the tripod, and calling it AmazonBasics. Well, they do a fine job at it. Yes, these are essential items and they are great!",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I have two of these, and one has this problem more than the other. The connection between the tripod and central element is a bit loose and allows the central pole to shift around a bit. Also, the central column isn't perfectly steady when raised either, even when tightened down, so it wobbles a bit too.I didn't expect perfection for the price, but I have gotten significantly sturdier tripods at this same price, and the inconsistent build quality between the two Amazon Basics tripods suggests that there is room for improvement.",3,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"With the light weight, I didn't expect this tripod to be particularly stable, and it wasn't. The real disappoint is with the lack of smoothness when panning or changing elevation angle.  It sticks, then releases regardless of the friction setting on the adjustment knobs.  I've tried lubricating it, but I haven't been able to disassemble the head to do that properly.  Customer support was almost worthless, although after much research they recommend a lubricant (silicon).  Don't expect a manual or exploded view diagram (hey, at least they didn't laugh at me during either of my separate calls). It's a cheap POS, just don't expect anything else.  I like the light weight when I have to carry it walking or bicycling.",2,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"Just arrived today. For the price point, I doubt you would find a better tripod. It has 2 sets of cam locks on each leg for 2 separate height adjustments.  Then, there is a crank system to raise the center section.  I put 3 different devices on it to try it out.  With my lightweight point and shoot and my small digital camcorder, the only complaint I have is the initial jolt when panning. This jolt is less noticeable with a heavier slr type camera (about 22 ounces) but it's still there.  This issue may work itself out with more use but only time will tell.  Seems fairly stable in its highest position. High winds may change that.  Unless you're indoors or its calm out, I wouldn't recommend straying too far from the tripod if it's fully extended.As others have stated, the quick release has a tab on the bottom for tightening the mount to your device which is nice and convenient. I personally don't have a need for the hanging hook but I'm sure others do.  Carrying bag that comes with is typical fabric for something in this price point.",5,1,2015-8-24,1,0,0
"I am a photographer and I was surprised by this tripod.  It is very well made, has the necessary elements for adjustment, quick mount and great height.  For the price it really cannot be beat.  Would I use it on a professional shoot?  Probably never.  I will use it for vacationing and for the cell phone use.  It is light weight and easily will pack in a carry-on bag. It is sturdy enough to hold a 35mm SLR without swaying or tipping.  The plastic gears though do not warrant the trust for a $2K camera.",5,1,2018-6-25,1,1,0
"PROS: Gets the job done on the cheap if you’re doing photography. I like the quick detach mechanism, the grip, and the leveling bumble. Aluminum and plastic. A good deal for the price.CONS: If you at shooting video, Do not bother with these! If you intend to shoot video where you need to pan the shot to the sides, the swivel heads on these tripods are horrible because they produce chatter in the side to side motion. It is just not smooth. I got a horrible chatter / vibration in my video. Also, if you will be shooting around people, it’s so lightweight that a small touch can shake the whole stand. Not good for video.",3,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"This was my first tripod so I can’t compare to other more expensive ones. I’m an amateur photographer and this met my needs very well. Taking videos, selfies, group photos it’s been great so far. It is very easy to carry in its bag, it’s lightweight, very easy to adjust height/angles, extend legs and change positions. Stability is good too! Overall I am very satisfied with it for my purposes. If you are like me don’t hesitate to give this Amazon product a try.  I’m giving it 5 stars because for the price it met all my expectations with flying colors so far.",5,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
"I love this tripod! It's an amazing price... Since it's so cheap, I really did not think it was going to be that good. But I've used it multiple times now, and it has worked amazingly every time. It has been very sturdy, extremely light weight, and it comes with a carrying case which really comes in handy. Plus, the height is really just perfect! I have multiple cameras and for the price, there really isn't a better tripod for the job. Especially if you're just starting out with photography or just need a basic tripod that will get the job done, then this is definitely the best option out there.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"This lightweight travel tripod will never replace the heavy duty tripod that I own that can withstand the wind, etc.. But this little beauty had so many great reviews and even a recommendation from a photographer in the field that I had to check it out.  So light but still sturdy, very inexpensive, and a must when you travel remote in small planes where they limit your weight.  A must if you are on foot a lot and need that tripod for scenic or astrophotography.  A mirrorless camera like a Sony a6000 is what I use.  I gave it a four star on durability because I have yet put it through that use and do not know how it will hold up.  I know that I have to treat it with more respect than my big tripod.",5,1,2018-8-3,1,0,0
"This tripod is an incredible value for the price! I purchased this knowing I couldn't afford to buy a very fancy tripod, but needed something sturdy and high quality just the same. I am a student taking a photography class, and enjoy photography a great deal; so purchasing a tripod was a must for me. This tripod gives you all the flexibility you might need, with a quick release plate that allows you to go from tripod to handheld in seconds, as well as two different levels to help you gauge how tilted the tripod is, a special carrying case, and even a hook to place a weight on the bottom of the tripod for windy situations! I have been using this heavily for about 4 months now, and can honestly say I have no complaints.It does not feel too flimsy or shaky when I have my camera on it, and it is extremely easy to set up and fold up.

There is a hook at the base- I’m not sure exactly what it’s for, but I hang my camera bag on it for more weight to secure the tripod. I like the height, as once you get the camera on, it’s a perfect height for group shots. We had 15 in our group and the level was nice (you don’t want to take pics from a lower angle and accent the chins!!!!), slightly higher than I anticipated.",5,1,2018-10-9,1,0,0
This is a great tripod. I am very satisfied with its ease of use and portability. I especially like that it seems very well made and not cheap generic like product. I have bought an inexpensive tripod in past that was a cheap walmart special but it was terrible. Was worthless. This however is wonderful. Im sure there are more expensive higher end products that are stronger heavier and just heavy duty for bulky super zoom lenses but this item is more than enough for me. It can easily support my canon dslr and lenses. Also the carry bag is very durable. All around great product. Its a bargain! I use this for Photography and video shoots.,4,1,2019-3-5,1,1,1

I am thrilled with the lightweight of it and the ease of using it at various heights.  It comes with an easy to use carry case and even has a little hook on the tripod for the case when not in use.  It is easy to manipulate into different viewing angles  It did not come with instructions, so you have to figure out how to adjust the heights, but after a couple of minutes, it became obvious.  Well worth the money if using with a heavy device.",5,1,2017-3-15,1,2,0
"I'm just a mom who likes to take photos so I didn't need anything fancy but wanted a tripod on hand for those occasions when we want everyone in the picture.

"I have a 70's tripod that is entirely metal parts, which continues to function well. However, it is heavier than the modern plastic & aluminum ones (like this product), so I thought to try out an Amazon Suggested product.Not that impressive since the key features of locking it into place fail to work within a year.

So far I am very pleased and this one seems to be much sturdier without a huge weight difference from the one I previously had. So far zero complaints. It seems to work for my Nikon d3500 perfectly and also for my smaller canon as well as my phone. It doesn’t come with a phone attachment piece, but those are easily found for cheap and I already had one also. It it easily adjusted and folds up and down easily.",4,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I bought this as a travel tripod. It's certainly light weight but it'a also very flimsy. Even with a 3 gallon water container hanging from the hook for stability it's pretty wobbly. The worst part is the head which is plastic to plastic and sticks terribly as you attempt to pan. With my Nikon D3200 + Tamron 1600 for long shots it's almost impossible to pan with enough smoothness to capture a moving object. It's also difficult to lock in an exact spot as the locking for up/down tends to move the camera as you rotate the lock. I'd buy something else. A lot of Amazon Basics stuff is good, but this it just awful. The picture shows it in use Aug 2019 at Speed Week on the Bonneville Salt Flats",1,1,2019-8-16,1,0,1

"Updated Review 2* May 2019: Not recommended for videography due to problematic horizontal pan.The first time I used the tripod it was a stationary setup. This time I needed to be able to pan.  Rotating the camera on its vertical axis was nice and smooth, however, rotating the camera along its horizontal axis from left to right was restricted/choppy even with the tightening knob fully disengaged. So much so that movement and video are choppy, and the whole tripod would move if not held securely. Problem is reduced when tripod is in its most stable position with all legs fully extended, but that isn't always an option.",2,1,2018-7-31,1,0,1
"Perfectly serviceable for lightweight cameras or for smartphones with the addition of an inexpensive smartphone mount.Should work well with consumer-level SLRs like the Canon Rebel.

Fittings and adjustments are pretty simple and provide a secure base with smooth operation, with lense-height adjustment from about 25.5-52.5"". Weight and folded length (24"") are a little much for extended carrying - even though it is probably a lot more manageable than a studio style tripod, and the carrying handle and bag are helpful. This is light enough you might want to sandbag the feet, even though weighting its central hanging hook could be equally effective.

It's comfortable to have in its bag. The aluminum build is nice and light and surprisingly sturdy thus far. Height adjusts easily and no trouble with setting it up and attaching the base to my camera.It does well at the beach even on sand, I had to use the small leveler indicators which worked well. The only small issue on sand is small amounts tend to get stuck between the legs but that eventually comes out with use. Only main issue was with the plastic piece holding the bag and strap together snapped early on. Easy fix was just to use a metal split key ring and that seems to have done the trick!",5,1,2017-4-11,1,1,0
I was given an older metal tripod that I have since misplaced.  I got a new iPad for Christmas for videoing my sons hockey games and I would get tired holding my arms up in the air trying to film over the glass.  This makes everything so much simpler!

"This is an excellent, inexpensive tripod for small cameras.  The legs are sturdy, it has a handle, and the included carry bag (mine had no Amazon logo) are a good value.  I'm using it to support a 7"" LCD monitor for FPV flight, and could also use it to hold my Runcam 2 or Xiomi Yi HD video cameras. The best feature of this tripod is the hook at the bottom of the center tube, which allows you to hang a sandbag or similar weight to keep the tripod from tipping over on windy days.That said, I wouldn't put an expensive DSLR camera on this tripod.  The leg supports that connect the center tube to the legs limits the distance the legs can be spread, which limits use.  For example, you wouldn't be able to spread the legs to an extreme to be able to use the tripod for macro closeups of flowers near the ground.  You also wouldn't be able to spread the tripod legs out as extra insurance against toppling over in a stiff wind, or to adjust for uneven terrain.  My $200 Slik tripod does both.

"After buying this tripod, I definitely have been taking way more photos and videos since it made the whole process much easier. For most using point and shoots or their phone, the tripod will not fall or damage your camera. The tripod is lightweight and is very portable. Furthermore, the carrying case is also super convenient to carry around for anyone on the go taking pictures or timelapses. I used this will the cell phone tripod adapter for my iPhone, and it really helps to shoot long videos where you don't want to be holding your phone for a long time. In addition, family photos have never been easier to shoot, there is no longer the need for another person to take your picture!If you are in need of a tripod for your phone or point and shoot camera, you should definitely consider this one.",5,1,2016-8-21,1,2,0
Love this. Fits my spotting scope at the outdoor range but much more cheaper and this looks like professional quality use. Great price point and has many features. Many reviews displaying cracking may be caused by user over tightening. It is plastic meeting aluminum parts so treat this a bit fragile and not good for bouncing around or loading heaving things on top. If you treat your camera or spotting scope delicately then this is just an extension of that and has to be used in the same fashion.  I enjoy this at the range and people always ask me where did I get it and for how much,5,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
"This is a lightweight tripod, good for basic stability. The fittings and hinges are mostly plastic, but it works well if you don't treat it like some heavy duty A/V tripod.

"One of the best products I've ever purchased on Amazon!!!! You can't go wrong especially for the price!!! It is waaaayyy cheaper that buying other identical products for the purpose. I have a Nikon D5200 camera and I have been wanting/needing to get a tripod for it to take videos of my child's band concerts. I hate to pay a lot for something that I'll use maybe 3 or 4x a year. Then I came across this one and read great reviews so I gave it a shot.Yes, it doesn't come with an instructional guide but it is not rocket science to figure out what the little knobs and knick knacks are for!!! It extends on a pretty great height and holds my camera still without worrying it will tip over. The base does not expand too too wide so it fits perfectly on those very tight auditorium seat leg spaces. The base that holds the camera detaches so you can attach the cam and just snap it back on and keep it in place. (Took me 2nd time using it to figure that one out! Lol)",5,1,2018-3-4,1,1,0
"I bought this after owning several tripods for my phone that are advertised as for phones, cameras, and for video cameras. I always end up breaking them because they're either cheaply made or just because I'm very rough on stuff. So after looking for quite a while I ordered this as a replacement for my others as I've broken several in the past few years. This is by far the best built tripod I've ever seen! It's SO much more rugged then everything else, yet it's not really more bulky. The tubing is oblong and squared in some areas which makes this a much stronger design then just about everything else unless you're willing to spend a couple hundred bucks that is. A huge added bonus is the built in telescoping vertical post. It's nice for after you've already set the leg height yet still need to go up or down a little more, yet if you do need to go up alot more it does extend upwards around a foot or so. I bought the extended warranty for this due to the fact I break everything but in reality this'll probably be the only one I don't need it for. Very well made Amazon, thank you! 👍👌",5,1,2018-7-26,1,0,0
"I'm new to photography. I have a Lumix G85, which is what I used on this tripod. The tripod worked great. It is easy to set up and it is reasonably sturdy; I never felt too nervous about my camera even while using the tripod on sand in Lummus Park in South Beach. When folded up, it fit easily into my luggage. It also comes with a nice case. I highly recommend it for its value and quality.Also, I am 5' 10"" (which is about the average male height) and it extends high enough for me to be able to take a video or photo of myself or any other person of average height at a straight angle just a few feet in front of the camera. This was a concern I had and I could not find a review addressing it. Indeed, almost every discussion in forums that I have found of a photographer's height in relation to any tripod pertains to whether the tripod extends high enough to make the photographer comfortable while taking the photos, not whether it is tall enough to allow for good photos of people standing in front of it without having to tilt the camera up at an angle.",5,1,2017-4-7,1,1,0
"Update: After making a warranty claim through amazon, AmazonBasics was very quick to respond and sent a replacement within a couple of days. I only gave them four stars because the other tripod broke, but I'm definitely appreciative of their customer service.The basic aluminum stand is sturdy enough, but the head mount and control peice is extremely cheap. Small parts to keep a screw in cracked or fell out under normal use, rendering it useless except for perhaps bashing peoples heads with. I bought this tripod less than a year ago, and expect more quality from an AmazonBasics product. (even if it was dirt cheap...)  To be fair, though, I cannot guarantee that my tripod wasn't a defective one, or this is just the general quality of these products. In any event, I am very disappointed.",4,1,2017-11-8,1,1,0
"Good quality yet a little flimsy due to how light weight it is. For the price though I would not mind it much if it was broken. You will want to pass on this tripod if your rig weighs more than 10lbs though as it feels like the legs would buckle under a good load. So if you have something in the weight range of an old VHS Brick-camcorder I would not trust in this to support it. As for the top clamp not holding the load and swiveling on it's own, get some paper and shove it in between the clamping surfaces. That will add more friction to the clamp and keep it from drooping when tightened.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I bought this tripod so I would have more options for using my Logitech webcam for online interfacing. I was not certain the base of the Logitech 920 would be compatible with this tripod, but it is 100%. The base of the webcam accepts the bolt on the tripod mounting plate perfectly. And there is a quick release feature on the tripod to ensure the webcam won't tip off when you move the unit around. Perhaps the less expensive tripod Amazon sells would also have worked, but I did not try that one - just went for this one because of the high reviews.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"Great little tripod for the price. It is definitely lightweight, comes with a carrying case, folds up easily (telescoping legs), and is perfectly sized for travel. However, it does have some issues.  Despite having  levelers built in (mini bubble levels) it has difficulty maintaining position once put in place. I tried to film an interview but the camera very slowly dropped back down out of the level position. It did this very gradually, probably a few mm at a time.  It also seemed to lack functionality.  While it was able to swivel horizontally, it would not tilt more than a few degrees. Removal of the camera from the tripod is a bit cumbersome but not difficult.  It came as part of a package deal so I wasn't expecting much.  If you are purchasing one for professional use, you may want to keep browsing. It is possible that I received a defective one given the number of 5 star reviews.",3,1,2018-4-4,1,0,0
"This tripod has so many features. I use it to take high resolution photos of my paintings, in progress as here and when completed. I'm not a photographer, so this is new to me, but this tripod has many more features than my husband's tripod, and he is an amateur photographer. I love the perpendicular bubble balances for leveling. The height extension is great. The feet of the tripod angle, to rest with stability on even an irregular surface. The tripod is adjustable in many ways to align a camera, and the tighteners are secure. The snap-off camera mount is very convenient. I like the crank for extending the height of the camera, instead of raising it manually. For such a well-constructed product, the price is a great deal. I am so glad I did not buy my tripod at the city photo store.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,0,1
"I love this simple and light-weight tripod and considering the price, it does a really good job. It doesn't feel cheap and has a good amount of adjustments you can do with the tripod. I bought this tripod for a photo shoot I did with my roommate and we did a fairly good amount of walking and this tripod did not feel heavy or burdensome to carry at all. However, when I got the tripod, one of the legs was broken so it was a bit of a struggle to adjust the legs to be the same length. I had the product replaced for a new one and within 2-3 business days I got a brand new one, all legs completely functional and working. Great tripod for beginner photographers like myself and great customer services. 5-Star!",5,1,2017-10-27,1,1,0
"This tripod is very light weight, perfect for birding outings where a heavier tripod would be tiring, awkward and cumbersome. It is sturdy enough for a camera with a 75-300mm telephoto lens, but may not be heavy/sturdy enough, or have enough mass for a very long telephoto lens and camera. It has a carrying handle, adjustments for lateral rotation,  vertical rotation, elevation, and a mount that attaches to the base of the camera or lens and allows for a quick connect/disconnect.  There are three telescoping segments to each of the three legs that lock securely.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"I believe when reviewing a product, price has to be a consideration. Given the cost and functionality it’s definitely a five star. I did send the first one back as the locking mechanism for the tilt function did not work.Having said that, the return process was as painless as it could have been. A new one was sent out as soon as the problem was reported and the replacement arrived promptly. It functions perfectly. This is considering a price slightly under $24.00.  Now, if I‘d paid $175.00 for it, I would not be as impressed as I am given what I paid. Also, if I were a professional photographer, I’d no doubt spend a couple of Benjamin’s on a carbon fiber tripod that would be more durable, but this one should last a good long time considering the anticipated use. Well worth it and I would do it again.",5,1,2018-11-16,1,0,0
"I loved this tripod when I first opened it! It's so tall and perfect for what I needed it for. Unfortunately, I went to use it last week I found that I couldn't extend one of the legs anymore because it had came apart for nothing! So evem when I extend it I can't lock it! I'm pissed because I don't want to go through sending it back and getting a replacement but I have no choice because I can't use it. I need to shoot full body shots meaning I need it to extend to it's tallest height. I have been trying to contact the seller 1st but I can't seem to find a way. I need this fixed asap I haven't even had it 3 weeks yet!",3,1,2019-10-7,1,1,1
It's not the best but for the purpose I bought it for which was aim toward my young kids aged 11 and 9 it's perfect. It provides them the necessary fun factor to use and you don't have to worry about them roughing it up and breaking it. This is a pretty tough tripod from the tripods that I have used. I have another one which I have my older kids using which is a little bit more delicate and expensive. This one provides just enough that I don't have to worry and I have piece of mind. I'm so satisfied this did not cost a fortune.,5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"For those questioning this tripod, it is what it is, which is a pretty sturdy, VERY light, easy to use tripod, especially for a beginner, or a back up, or just something to put your camera on. I don't use the thin extention legs because it gets less stable when using those, and I don't eed it to go that high. I extend the center pole to it's highest point, and extend the thicker legs all the way and that's it. The only thing I would improve on would be the left to right swivel. It's kind of tight and jerky and not good for a really smooth pan. That said, it is plastic, and for $25, it's not to be expected. For the price, though, it is perfectly fine and quite sturdy for any camera you can put on it. PS - the detachable plate is the best part of it as I go back and forth between tripod shots and hand held. Thanks Amazon!! : )",4,1,2017-1-14,1,1,0
"I was very pleased with this tripod. Extends easily and stable once locked down. Not for heavy cameras with mega lenses, or meant for heavy work, not a top of the line pro tripod, but it's 25 bucks, not 700.  Very usable for the average enthusiasts,  or as a light stand etc. It holds my pentax k3, with a tamron 70-200 lens quite well, wouldn't  push it much farther. Buy it for what it is, and you'll be happy, might get another just to toss in the trunk in case. Pleased. PS: the removable base can be put on in any direction, helps avoid confusion.",5,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0
I was debating to purchase this product due to some negative reviews on YouTube. I bought many tripods from eBay and other online retailers. They all look great and even work great for a few weeks and then everything starts falling apart. I was a little skeptical about buying this however I decided to give it a shot and it was a great decision. I would recommend this to anyone.,5,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0
"Wow. I've bought many tripods in the past but this is probably the best you'll get at this price point. The legs of the tripod feel sturdy, and the grips feel durable. It doesn't wobble at all! The screw that attaches to your camera/microphone has a removable mount for easy access. Everything on this tripod feels well thought out and carefully engineered. The plastic parts don't feel cheap and amazon uses metal pieces where its needed. It doesn't feel too heavy when carrying around! (Although I'm not really going anywhere)",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"Very convenient tripod at a good price. It sets up nicely and is fairly straightforward, though it's not always clear what does what when you first start out. I got this to hold an iphone for recording and it does this rather well when you purchase an additional mount.My main gripe is that the tripod wobbles if you try to change the angle. This basically means that for quality recordings, you can't move it without messing up the footage. I tried using this to record a dance performance, but when I changed the angle using the handle, the picture wobbled, and the audio picked up on the noise.",3,1,2015-11-3,1,2,0
"I really like this tripod, but would like to see a little more rigidity, the hook for a weight is a must and a good feature.Used it a lot over the forth of July, sighting several firearms and it worked well as long as we were careful not to bump any part of it.",4,1,2016-7-10,1,2,0
"I have a plein air easel that I purchased that came with a tripod to support it.  The original tripod broke so I replaced it with this one.  This tripod is more sturdy than the original and more stable.  Once the easel angles and height is set, it stays put.  I like the addition of the hook on the center post that allows me to put some weight in the carry bag to keep it standing in wind.  I have not yet tested it outside, but it has been great for working on small paintings in the studio.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"Very nice tripod for the price. Folds up easily and is very compact. The locking mechanisms for the legs wont handle rough use and seem to be a little on the cheap side, but at this price point its more than adequate.The adjustability is very nice and will easily stay in any position. It comes with a nylon carrying case with large zippers that seems well constructed. There were no instructions included, at least in my package, so it took a little bit to discover some adjustments.",4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"Clean lines, item nicer looking than pic and seems sturdy enough for all my needs. Like the twin bubbles (a selling point for me) and I imagine it will break in nicely with some use-would rather have some stiff at start than slop 'n flop. Fits my FZ30 and the 35mm just fine and should go all the way w/my med. format S1000. The weight hook's a handy touch I WILL need it at times due to some of the locales I shoot (beaches, wilderness &  mtns.). It will be tested at these times of need. Great for the price. Works so far with the testing shots around here. Arrived as promised as usual. I like it.",4,1,2017-9-24,1,1,0
Only problem is the screw to attach the camera is too short.  Looking for a different mount for this.  I ended up making a bracket to compensate for the short screw.  Device has to be offset from center a bit but it works.  Manufacturer really needs to address this issue.  Would be simple to make it so the screw is NOT captured or to provide a an additional mount to account for devices which may require the longer screw.  This product would have received 5 stars from me if not for that simple issue.,3,1,2019-4-24,1,0,0
I have bought other amazon basics product before mostly HDMI cables and what not but decided to buy this for a friend as he is learning photography and needed a tripod for those cool steady shoots that he needed.

"Seems like a sturdy tripod and the reviews are great so I spent more than I planned on this tripod. It's easy to set up and the level is a plus but it's hard to see it with the camera attached. The camera covers the level. The legs slip and retract after you expand and tighten them so you have to keep your eye on it. I have only used it a handful of times. A year later now: I forget each time about the legs. I used it last week. I walked about 4 feet away to get something, a leg slipped and there went my camera to the floor and my upgraded lens broke. Now it's no longer just a time sucking pain to keep pulling the legs back out; it cost me $600.",2,1,2019-4-13,1,0,0
"Felt sturdy and stable yet lightweight for a full-sized tripod. I got it because of the two levels on the tripod head, but ultimately decided to return it because it is still too big and heavy for my purposes of traveling and hiking to take long-exposure landscape or astrophotography. It would be too much for me to carry even with my camera backpack having a specific design for carrying tripods. I got the smaller 50-in tripod instead and that one is much lighter and easier to carry.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"Bought these to mount my VR headset sensors on. They would work great for a camera too. They fold up very compactly, come with a carrying case, and are easy to set up.

There is a quick release mount so you can mount the camera or device without having to maneuver around with the tripod. Great buy!",5,1,2017-10-26,1,1,0
"I recently purchased this tripod to use with a Canon Rebel T3i DSLR. Setting the tripod up is extremely easy and offers a lot of tweaking potential. Additionally, it's extremely light and packs up very tightly, so I would definitely recommend it as a cheap travel tripod. The ball joints on the feet allow it to stand on uneven ground and the hook allows you to hang a weight and stabilize it. If you're shooting pictures on Auto or in normal lighting, you won't have any issues. However, while photographing slightly longer exposures (roughly 1/30s or longer) it's actually not very stable - even hitting the shutter button leads to some vibration, so you can't get a solid long exposure. As a result, I had to set my camera to a 10 second timer so that it can stabilize. I don't think it's reasonable to expect perfect stability from a cheap aluminum tripod, though, so this is still a good deal for the price.",4,1,2017-2-27,1,0,0
"What I definitely needs was a LIGHT tripod. And it's definitely light. Won;t hurt my back if I carry it out into the wilderness.Unfortunately, I was looking for a video tripod, which Amazon tricked me and told me this was... it isn't tho'. You can't really pan on this without looking jerky.",5,1,2018-4-13,1,1,0
"Love it. I use it with my phone + mobile adapter (bought separately). Very easy to set up and move around. I will admit there are some finer adjustment nobs that go over my head as a casual user, but it was worth it for me to buy the more expensive model to make sure it was sturdy. When it's all adjusted and tightened, it does not budge. I think it would do well with larger/heavier cameras. I wish it had come with a phone adapter, but the one I bought fits on fine. The carrying bag fits perfectly snug, so the only way I can fit the phone adapter in the bag with it is to put the tripod in the bag upside down. It's a tight fit, but it works.",5,1,2018-4-28,1,0,0
"This tripod is full of features that are present on much more expensive tripods. A removable shoe, which at first seemed a bit large, but it allows my camera to sit balanced on it above the surface that it's sitting on when not on the tripod. It's amazing that they can even manufacture and sell a tripod for under $25 that has everything you need including bubble levels, a removable shoe, nice handles and knobs, flexible feet at the bottom, a crank handle that will raise and lower the center post, and a hook below the post for a counterweight. Unless you are professional making money with your camera and can easily afford a more expensive tripod I would highly recommend this one for any recreational photographer.",5,1,2018-12-6,1,0,1
"I think you get what you pay for with this product, it broke after less than half a dozen uses in 2 months. This was a gamble because the tripod was affordable and generally had good reviews.Right of the bat there is nothing ""wrong"" with this tripod. My first use was for a still shot with lots of time for composition.  It has a smooth extension and felt pretty sturdy even with its plastic components, but after the initial thoughts it went downhill.",1,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"I was not sure how this would hold up since other photographers spend way more on their tripods, as someone starting out this seems to get the job done, although with all of the legs out it does seem to be a bit uneven so I slightly have to make 2 of the other legs lower for it to be balanced which may just be a slight flaw in mine. I use this for real estate photography and have not had any issues other than the above, I like that it has a center column so I can adjust the height without having to adjust the legs of the tripod.",4,1,2018-10-23,1,0,0
"This thing surprised me considering how cheap it was. I had my expectations low, but was rather surprised at it when I set it up. All the adjustments you need and quality hardware.

"Very nice tripod. It has a good, wide base when the legs are extended to make it a very sturdy, stable tripod. It has a level on it so you can make sure your camera or smart phone is taking a very level video.

"I bought this tripod for my second digital camera, which is about half the size of my first one. I know there are brackets available that let you use the camera in your cell phone or tablet. You can mount spotter scopes or binoculars too. Who knows what cameras will look like 5 years from now, but I bet they will have a screw mount in the bottom and a tripod will still be a good idea.I was surprised to learn how affordable such a useful accessory can be so before spent my 27 bucks I watched some utoob videos on how to select and use a tripod (I think I might need a monopod too!). And, of course I read the Amazon user reviews.The few bad reviews seemed to concern the tripod being shaky when the center tube extension was cranked up and/or the total lack of instructions.I think the two issues are related and Amazon could eliminate 5 of the 7 bad reviews by including instructions. The center tube IS shaky, even when it's all the way down, until you tighten the collar.",5,1,2017-11-21,1,1,0
"This is my third tripod, and the cheapest tripod I've ever bought... and probably the best for what I use it for!  It weighs, to a first approximation, nothing.  The details are there: bubble levels to level your tripod and your camera, quick releasing leg clamps, swiveling feet that are easy on floors, a quick-release plate, and a hook to hang things from the center of the tripod for stability.  I would have preferred a metal (or at least removable) hook, but if that's the only problem I have with it, we're doing well.  It's a bit light for some things, like time lapses on windy days or video work, and is very easy to accidentally move around, but for something that feels like I'm carrying a small bottle of water, I'll deal.",5,1,2018-2-24,1,0,0
"I was shocked to see that Amazon Basics sells a tripod.  I ordered it without hesitation, as I've been impressed by Amazon Basics before.  This does not disappoint.  It is super lightweight.  The tabs to extend the legs are easy to flip open and closed.  The head pivots any direction that you could want, and is easy to adjust.  All of the knobs feel tight and secure.My favorite feature of the tripod is the quick disconnect for the camera.  The biggest pain with my old tripod was repeatedly screwing the camera body on and off of the tripod.  This totally eliminates that problem, as you can pop it off in 2 seconds to get a better view of the lcd.",5,1,2016-2-24,1,2,0
"Very impressed with the quality of this item.  I was expecting something cheaply made, to use in the interim only to have to be replaced with a more expensive item later, but was pleased when it came in.  No replacement needed.  Used several times already, all the mechanisms work seamlessly so far.  May have to lubricate some the telescoping mechanics later, but user maintenance is expected. Easily attached my cannon, and my recently purchased movo smart phone video kit. Will be looking for more amazon basics if this is the kind of product they are going to put out.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
I'm starting to really like Amazon Basics! My husband bought me this tripod for my camera and it is incredibly easy to assemble and disassemble. It also has many different settings and has the ability to be as tall or as short as you need it to be.

"This was supposed to be a momentous occasion for me, my first ever tripod, and yet, it's not what I expected.My initial search in Amazon was travel tripod so I assumed that the tripod would be travel size, thin, light and sturdy; the high reviews were also a factor in my purchase but this product was a bit bulky and heavy for my taste. I don't doubt the reviews, it is an awesome product, it's sturdy, and very versatile in terms of manipulating its parts for different purposes, its packaging was also executed well, you can really feel it's a premium product but it's just not what I was expecting since my camera doesn't need all that quality.

"So I found myself wanting to take family Christmas photos.  I have a Canon Rebel T3i camera (also purchased on Amazon) which is great and I saw can take a tripod and remote control.  I went out looking for a Manfrotto since that's what I used in school and they are great.  But then I saw this stand for like 1/10 of the price.  Yeah you read that right.  Move the decimal place to the left digit.  It's an ""AmazonBasics"" which I was not familiar with, but I assumed it was rebranded leftovers.  The reviews on this were good, so I took a chance at saving some cash since I honestly won't use the tripod more than a couple times a year.  And I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a solid little tripod that does the job.  It's not as well-made as a Manfrotto, but at the price I can replace it 9 times for the price of one of those.It's light and pretty easy to figure out.  It has a levelling bubble so you know it's straight.  The legs are easily individually height adjustable so you can level it on a small grade (which I had to do).",5,1,2015-1-15,1,1,0
I purchased this for my best friend who needed a tripod for his iPad and recording equipment. He let me borrow it for my Nikon D7100. This is a great tripod for the price. I love that it has a removable platform to allow you to easily remove and replace your camera on the tripod. It easily rotates with 360 degree turns. It is lightweight and when I add it to my camera bag it is not uncomfortable to travel with. The middle hook allows for a sandbag to be place to prevent wobbling. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an affordable tripod that can do what the more expensive ones are capable of doing.,5,1,2017-8-3,1,2,0

"The description describes it perfectly. It comes in a durable cloth-like carry bag that makes it easy to store. As of now it absolutely fits all of my current needs as an amateur photographer.

"I bought this tripod because I didn't have one and I don't have a lot of money to spend on one.  I like that it came with a carrying case and is light weight.  It's simple to mount the camera to, but it's kind of cumbersome with the movements.  I have used it for quick and simple backyard shots and it was fine.  However, when I took it on a wildflower shoot with my photography club, I realized that I will need to invest in something much better.  I had issues with it panning down and staying in place.  It kept wanting to jump up just enough to mess up my shot.  I had to force it down while I hit the shutter button.  A couple of times when I would try to pan a certain way, the plate would pull off.  I would loosen it up and it would be too loose or tighten it and would obviously be too tight!  It was hard to find the just right spot.  For now, it's ok.  I'll continue to use it until I can get a nicer one.",3,1,2016-3-9,1,0,0
"Lightweight and fully adjustable.  Easily attaches to my backpack when hiking and light enough that it hardly seems like it is there.  Comes with a quick release plate that attaches to the camera body (or lens mount) and makes it quicker to set-up on the tri-pod.  The down side to this set-up is if you change between the camera body and a lens mount, you will need to remove the plate from the camera body and install it on the lens.  If you use you camera with multiple lenses (that use a mount), go ahead save yourself the headache and order extra quick release plates  to use on each of these items.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0

"Like a lot of reviewers here, I was pleased with the functionality of this tripod at first, especially for the price. Right away, however, I noticed two issues. First, the rubber feet would come off while the tripod was just riding around in the case in the car. Not too big of a problem. Just find the foot and put it back on. Of course, eventually one of the feet came off and could not be found, which makes the tripod useless. The other issue I had was that the tripod was so light that even a light breeze could knock it down. So in certain conditions, you had to keep one hand on it at all times. It's a lesson in getting what you pay for.",2,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I give it five stars because of the price. So inexpensive.Important facts about it: the legs don't go very wide. It's more about being tall than about being stable. Good for use in cramped studios. There's a hook to hang a weight on, which will lower the center of gravity, to make it more stable.",5,1,2014-9-26,1,1,0
WOW man these things rock. I had my Canon t2i attached i had a light and mic on it. Then i had my bag underneath with 2 cameras 10 batteries and other misc items and the handle and tripod was perfect no bending or flexing ONLY ONE minor flaw the pan and tilt IS NOT SMOOTH at all even with my sony handy cam it was not fluid in anyway even when completely lose it was stuttering while moving it. Maybe some lube would help but still for the price a nice tripod.,4,1,2018-4-3,1,1,0
"Works perfectly with my Nikon D750. I don't understand many reviewers being high and mighty and saying that you need to spend a lot of money on a tripod if you spent a lot of money on your camera. I took this thing backpacking Europe and used it many times on rough, uneven, wet terrain. It was perfect. It's very light, which is perfect for travel, so I'd just be cautious if you're ever using it in windy conditions because it could be at risk of blowing over when you've got your camera mounted on it.",5,1,2017-9-15,1,1,0
"This just arrived and it looks scratch up like somebody had used it and returned it but amazon insist it was brand new. Pretty sure new stuff don’t come all scratch up in obvious spots.With that being said, if you are a amateur photographer hobbyist like myself, this tripod works great. It is affordable, have 2 fluid leveler built in so you won’t get crooked pictures. Materials seems to be steady and as well built as it can be for twenty something dollars. Not as lightweight as it is saying but then again it is not made of carbon fiber so expect it to have some weight.

"You get what you pay for. It's fine for casual use but it's not sturdy enough to withstand travel. The plastic grip broke before even the first use - no big deal since its really light and you dont need it. Then the wind knocked the tripod over (which is a really possibility considering how light it is) and one of the leg extensions broke. Finally, its really prone to dust and after a week the legs and center arm would not collapse or extend smoothly. Bottom line - if you need it once in a while for family events and indoor functions, no problem. If you need a rugged travel companion, look elsewhere.",2,1,2018-7-15,1,0,0
"Honestly, I have a tripod and accidentally ordered this. I was going to just return it when it arrived, but I opened it to take a look. Wow! I'm tossing my old cheap tripod! This on is so incredibly adjustable, even has a built-in level, a carrying bag, and works with both my iphone and my Nikon! It's so light and portable! Maybe not great if you shot in wind storms or war, but it really does the trick for talking heads and volleyball games. I'm so happy with this purchase. I will update if it falls apart, but for now, I am in love. Tripods have come a long way.",5,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0
The AmazonBasics 60-inch LightWeight Tripod broke within three month of very light use.  One of the rivets that holds one of the leg supports in place sheared off.  I did not use the tripod very much in three months.  You can only return this product for one month.  I will have to contact customer service under the one year warranty to see what it will entail to fix this thing. What a pain.  I temporarily installed a cotter pin to substitute for the lost rivet.  The tripod was fine for three months.,1,1,2016-9-15,1,6,0
Very nice for the price. I like the levels and ball bearing feet. Everything locks positively into place and eliminates any wiggle. Quick release so you can keep the mount on your camera and slip it on the the tripod very quickly. Carrying case included. It's lightweight and exactly what I was looking for. Even if I only use this a couple times a year it's paid for.,4,1,2017-10-29,1,1,0
"For the price, I was expecting something like my dad had gave me for a camera tripod decades ago. An annoying screw by screw adjustment followed by trying to adjust the height to level out. I did not read the details of this tripod review because it was cheap and I needed one quickly. Upon getting it I was more than impressed by its features. It has snaps to adjust, and you really only have to screw the camera in once as the base of the tripod where the camera goes can be clipped off. The tripod even has a level on it to affirm you're straight. I love this thing. I thought I might invest in a better one later on, but I am more than satisfied with this one.",5,1,2017-4-27,1,1,0
"I previously reviewed the AmazonBasics Wireless Remote for Canon cameras, and I am giving the tripod a similar rating. You definitely get what you pay for, a solid, functional tripod with no frills, no fuss, and at a great price. If you have heavy professional camera equipment, you're probably not reading this review, but if you are, just stop now and buy a Manfrotto. This tripod is not intended to compete with higher end carbon fiber designs, it is designed for people who want the utility of a tripod, but don't feel like breaking the bank. Honestly, for the price of a higher end tripod, you can buy the AmazonBasics model and a brand new Canon ""nifty fifty"" lens. If you shoot a ton of long range, still, or landscape photography, then you may just need to get something a bit sturdier. But if you're a hobbiest, or if you only plan to shoot from the tripod occasionally, this product is right in your wheelhouse. The packaging is AmazonBasic, but who cares if it doesn't come with a bow on top or a free sticker inside. There is a very cheap nylon carry bag, which is plenty capable of storing the tripod. I've used this thing to shoot family photos during Christmas, late night shots of the moon, and it is also a convenient way to store your camera at home without putting it away in its case, I just throw my camera on the tripod, and when I need it, it's there. This may change, of course, when I have a baby running around...",4,1,2015-1-7,1,0,0
"I am absolutely in love with this tripod. It does everything that I wanted from it and more. It allows me to take perfectly stable pictures and videos from my iPhone. I bought a universal mount and it fits right on here. The height is adjustable and it locks into place. You do not have to worry at all about it falling out of place. There are actual locks on the sides of the tripod so tht you can love it at 3 levels. Short, medium, and tall. You can easily maneuver your phone or camera. I used this with my phone and it works great. It is pretty stable for a lightweight tripod. It arrived in perfect condition and I have experienced no problems with it. It is easy to work and you are getting a truly quality product for a low price.",5,1,2017-4-23,1,1,0
"I can't say if the bad reviews are from people who just don't understand how to work the tripod or if I just got lucky. However, I have found this tripod to be very light and sturdy. I have had no issues with it supporting the weight of my camera and lens with no wobble.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,1,0
"Bought this to use with a Leupold spotting scope I had. The scope came with a tripod in a 'kit', but the Leupold tripod is junk compared to this thing. This thing is fully customizable with adjustments for just about everything. I've used it on my back porch with the scope to check out the mountains about 5 miles away. Super easy to use and seems well made for the price. I haven't taken this on any elk hunts so I don't know how it will stand up to the backcountry, but if you're just looking for a tripod for a camera or something like that, this thing is outstanding. I do expect this will hold up well in the backcountry as it comes with a decent black zippered base to protect it when it's on my pack. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this thing again.",5,1,2016-5-8,1,1,0
"Sure there are better tripods out there but you won't beat this one for construction and features for what I paid. I hung a 3 lb weight plate from the bottom hook for added stability and I couldn't be more pleased. I use it for taking pictures of merchandise to sell on ebay and it's perfect for that purpose. BTW the Velbon QB-4W Quick Release Platforms that fit this tripod can be had from ebay for $1.79 each.  Top measurement is 66mm X 52mm, slightly larger than the original Amazon one but the measurement that counts is the bottom one which is an exact match of 44mm X 44mm.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"As others have said, better than any ~$20-something dollar item has any right to be.Others have gone into exhaustive reviews, so really just here to pad the stats: sturdy/well constructed (i.e. pieces fit together well), very adjustable, lots of small ""nice"" features (directional feet with rubber boots to dampen vibrations, weight hook, etc).  It's north of 3 pounds, so at least 1-1.5 pounds heavier than ""ultralight"" tripods that are literally 10x the price (~$200+).  Will update the review if this happens to break at some point, but I'd be very surprised.",5,1,2017-12-7,1,1,0
"Make no mistake, this is not a high end product.  However it is a fantastic value.  It is light enough to pack around anywhere you go and if something happens to it you're not out a fortune.  It is surprisingly durable for its cost and weight.  It does have a bit of wiggle to it so you will want to use a remote shutter release and lock things down as well as you can.  Its hard to control the movement, it doesn't pan as smoothly as a tripod that costs 4-20 times as much (imagine that) but I view it as a disposable tripod.  I take it places where I wouldn't want to bring a more expensive tripod in case it gets stolen or falls over a ledge.  I also always keep it in my vehicle with a binocular mount in the bag so I can use it anytime for viewing birds or whales, etc.  If you don't take a lot of pictures and just need an occasional tripod, this is a good product.  If your camera is a point and click, this is your tripod.  If you just want a tripod to steady your binoculars this should serve your needs.  If you are an amateur photographer and need your first tripod, you will not regret buying this.Professional photographers shouldn't even be looking at this product though.",5,1,2015-3-29,1,0,0
"I am actually really impressed with this tripod. This is my second tripod I’ve owned so I haven’t been through a bunch but I can honestly say so far I’m impressed. The material doesn’t feel cheap, it’s not too heavy and not too light so you can carry it around without feeling like you’re working out and it can hold up a DSLR without feeling like the tripod will give out. So far I’m having no issues with anything. The legs stay in place and I feel comfortable with it holding my $3000 camera. I’d definitely recommend to anyone needing a tripod.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"This product is very lightweight, but it’s also seems very fragile. I’m using it for an indoor setup so it’ll be hiding for what I need. If there’s a potential chance that something could knock into it, I wouldn’t purchase this tripod. The only other thing that is kind of a pain is the plate is difficult to put in if you want to switch the direction of the retention pin.Overall, this product is great for what I need it for. I just caution those who plan on beating up the tripod a bit.",4,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"Almost all 4 and 5 star reviews speak for themselves. Amazon did good here. I actually got out of the car with mine attached to a ronin-s with a d3500 and a Milvus 1.4 50mm and it like was juuuuust the tipping point to how much leveraging the hinge could take. Scared me half to death. That's also what I get for not carrying it by the Ronin, rather than trying to be a cool guy, or even being aware of which way I had the hinge facing lol Thing is, it only dropped a little tiny bit, and now there is just a small bit of play on that hinge. So I'll need a new one, but this one is not only usable still, but it was crazy amount of weight that only damaged it a tiny bit.",5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0
This little tripod lasted me about a year. Worked really great for my Cannon with standard sized lens attachments. Was comfortable to lug around when hiking out in the woods or in the city. Easy to use. Recently bought a large ef 300 mm lens that may have been to heavy for it. The tripod attached directly to the lens and the plastic nobs that tighten down the unit wore out quickly soon after.. I could have over tightened but better safe than sorry with this lens!!,4,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
I purchased the APEMAN NM4 Portable Video DLP Pocket/Mini Projector which says it has a standard trip pod hole. I was hopeful that this tripod would fit and it did. The tripod itself is fairly easy to adjust. The quality looks good and I love that it comes with a carry case that has a handle. I haven't had it long so not sure how well it will stand up to constant travel to site locations but so far so good. Very light wait which is a must.,5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"This is a very lightweight and extremely easy to adjust tripod. Simply flip the clips to adjust--even on uneven terrain. It's easy to carry with the handle and adjusts up and down in a half dozen ways. I love that it has two levels built in as well as a quick-disconnect shoe, which is invaluable. The last tripod I bought and used for magazine articles and pictures was heavy and clumsy to handle. I purchased this one for pictures for a craft book. It is so easy to use and adjust!",5,1,2017-7-6,1,1,0
"I first purchased this tripod three years ago for casual use as a photo hobbiest. Since the pandemic it has come into much more vigorous use. Every day it seems I am finding something else the tripod is able to do. I have a couple other tripods that are gathering dust. This one is my go to tool for taking pictures, and virtual meetings as well. It easily accepts tablet and phone holders too. I don’t think I will ever need another one as it is so adaptable to any situation indoors or out!",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
My son just received and put it together yesterday. TODAY the part holding the webcam popped off and broke. I wanted to send it back but he said it wasn’t worth the effort as it was cheap — well buyer beware when something is cheap — and he could “make it work”. So he just switched out webcams and used tape. Completely disappointed in this piece of equipment.  He does streaming online so it was in one place so it wasn’t like it was being moved around even.,2,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
"The tripod value is not terrible for the price. I took a few stars off because the quick release mounting plate isn't the best quality (it was stuck on too tight to my camera even though I hadn't tightened it and could only get it off using pliers) and because somewhere along the line, I found a tiny spring and piece of plastic on the floor. I have no idea where they came from or if they're an important part of the tripod.I have a Nikon D3100 and with the 18-55mm lens, I wasn't concerned at all about weight distribution. The pan head is smooth and I like that the tripod legs lock and release with the clamps rather than twisting them locked.",3,1,2015-4-29,1,1,0
"Product was received damaged. The handle is bend but still does work. I also did not receive the adapter plate with the 1/4 stud out of the top. Was using on a cabinet project and needed alittle taller stand, well im out $$$ and i dont feel like driving 30 miles back to town to return this tripod.

"I purchased this tripod as I needed slightly more height than the tripod I had been using.  First off the quality and features are first rate.  The double built in levels are a nice touch and the parts fit, handles, gears, plate lever are really nice.The best feature for me however, is the nice small footprint.  I use this to hold my video camera for bench work and the distance between legs when they are full extended is 30"" (my old tripod was (43"").  This means I can tuck the tripod up closed to the bench which I love.  I am TOTALLY pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2018-11-14,1,0,0
"This is a decent tripod considering its rock bottom price. Obviously, it is far from professional quality. I bought this unit to replace a nearly identical one that is many years old with a failing leg lock.After unboxing, I immediately mounted my Sony a6000 with my 18-200mm lens. I had to tighten the tilt mechanism quite a bit in order to prevent the weight of the lens from tilting the head downwards, but that was no big deal. For panning, I loosened the adjustment all the way. I film a lot of video, and therefore want my panning to be a smooth as possible. It is still somewhat jerky, but we are dealing with a sub $25 tripod, not $50+ fluid head.",4,1,2016-2-20,1,0,0
"The good: like it, gets the job done, everything works just fine, all types of dimensional changes possible, even has a hook to hang weights, the camera snaps in and out very quickly,.The bad: not a lot, it feels a little flimsy, not really the best quality, so I wouldn't rely on it for heavy duty use.",4,1,2018-2-27,1,0,0
"Has a number of good features including the price, but unfortunately the swivel from left to right is sticky & as I bought this to film boxing matches I have found it incredibly frustrating to use.I have tried to free up the action unsuccessfuly, does anybody out there know how to fix this? The other compaint I have is that Amazon gave the packaging size accurately but then put the box inside a larger box & as I live in New Zealand the freight cost me an arm & leg, far far higher than I expected",1,1,2017-2-25,1,4,0
"This tripod is the replacement for a much more expensive tripod purchased at a camera store several years ago. It's lighter & easier to carry, extends much higher, has more axes of motion for the head, and is rock-steady when set up. The quick-release camera mount has turned out to be an unexpected but big ""plus"" on several occasions, and one of my friends who's a much more serious photographer (with much more expensive equipment) said he wanted one the first time he saw me using mine.Since it was delivered, I've used this tripod for shooting long time-lapse sequences, fireworks displays, group photos, portraits, and timer pictures and the results (using the same camera) have been at least as good as those gotten with a heavier tripod costing more than twice as much. The ability to hang a weight from the bottom hook for added stability in windy weather has been helpful, and the extra-high extension (along with the smooth crank control) has allowed me to shoot through high windows with ease.",5,1,2016-9-8,1,0,0
"Why 5 Star: Sturdy; the leg quick clips work perfect; quick release works as promisedJust can't beat Amazon Basics products. Not much to say here. It arrived packaged perfect. No damage. Works as needed. Both my Son and have one of these. We use it for our Canon DSLR with ASP-C telephoto lenses. These are heavier lenses and it handles them fine. We have set them up for long exposures at night and there is no head creep. It holds sold. Understand it does not have that liquid smooth head a more expensive tripod has, but I figure if you need that, you will not be looking at something in this price range anyway.",5,1,2017-1-13,1,1,0
"For the money, this is an adequate tripod and yes, I'd buy it again.  You have to set your expectations correctly, given the price point  This tripod is easy to set up and has the adjustments you need for getting it level.  The legs are light weight metal but a lot of the other pieces are plastic.  You get what you pay for and, if you want a really heavy duty workhorse, this isn't the product for you.  It does do the job for occasional use, which is what I bought it for.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Many years ago, I had a similar model to this branded by a different manufacturer but probably made in the same factory somewhere and I loved it. I know that there are some purists who would never consider using this for their camera of choice, but I have no qualms about using it as long as I feel comfortable with the weight of the camera vs which tripod I use. I have found no difference between this tripod and the old ""Ray-O-Vac"" model I used before. So, I use this whenever I don't need to bring out my heavy professional Calumet model or if I know for sure I won't be doing any work that requires pans and tilts since this tripod cannot do those smoothly. There are always workarounds to most situations and I did use a tripod similar to this as my only tripod for years before I got a better one. It forces you to find ways to make it work for your needs. I also have no doubt that in time, this tripod will also break down just as the Ray-O-Vac one did since these tripods are rarely meant to last. But for myself, I feel that it's a good trade-off vs what I can use it for before that time. So I do recommend it as long as you keep in mind what it's limitations are.",5,1,2016-1-18,1,0,0
"I have 2 of these, 1 ostensibly for home and one for travel.  Unfortunately, my travel one has broken after just 3 weeks or so of light use.  My home one, which I got over a year ago is still fine, but it gets gentler use I suppose, less putting it up and taking it down and shifting it around and bumps and such.  This is a nice sized tripod with good adjustments and its very cheap, but it seems like it just wont hold up to much use.",2,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"Got this tripod to video 360 real estate tours. It is very stable, easy to set up and level.  It works perfectly for what I needed.

"This is an ok tripod for the price. A couple weeks after getting it, one of the legs fell apart. Amazon replaced it right away. Also, the part that connects the camera to the tripod, it is detachable but has a drawback. It is tricky to screw onto the bottom of your camera and has a second little metal piece that sticks out which you have to try to tuck in while screwing it on. If your camera loads batteries and memory cards on the bottom, this is especially a pain.

"I am stepping up my game so to speak and needed a tripod for night photography. I reaserched this particular model extensively. There are several reviews of this model on YouTube. Most of the reviews were positive, so I decided to go for it. This is exactly what I was looking for. It works great with my Nikon D5200 and as a beginning videographer, I needed a tripod that would get the job done at an afforadable price. I did not come with an insruction manual, but as I've mentioned there are several videos that show how to set up and use. For the price, it can't be beat.

Purchased this from my wife has her first tripod. The legs are metal they had this plastic. It is a nice big dinner repeat beginner tripod. It does not the same quality as a man Frodo. But this gets the job done and it does it well. The head is not replaceable. It is very light weight and compact I have used it on occasion for time lapse photography with my medium format camera and I felt my medium format camera was secure.,3,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I'm not looking for something that has all the fancy bells and whistles, especially since at the moment I don't know what I'll be using it for specifically.  This is a great solution!  Easy enough to unpack when I need it and pack it back up when I'm finished.  Keeps my Canon 80 DSLR stable and everything is easy enough to adjust.  Glad it has the hook below too because it isn't the most sturdy due to how lightweight it is, which is why I put my camera backpack on it!",5,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
"The metal thread for the screw of t adjustment knob for tilt position is misaligned with the plastic housing. The plastic piece for where the screw goes in is already broken and now the tilt position won't hold making the tripod completely useless. So disappointed. You do get what you pay for. Amazon makes money on volume, not quality. You think you're winning by spending less but in the end you actually spend twice as much.",1,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I was not expecting much from an amazonbasics tripod, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The tripod is very lightweight, of high build quality and comes with some fantastic features for an entry level economy tripod.  The unit is easy to set up, has a hanging hook, comes with a quick connect for a DSLR camera and comes with a carrying case.  There are two levels to assure proper set up of your imaging device and the handle and locks for the handle are well done. I would highly recommend this tripod",5,1,2017-12-11,1,1,0
"This is the first tripod I have ever bought and needless to say, I am greatly impressed! While some of the plastic materials look like they could break fairly easily, for what you're paying for it's a very good bargain. All of the knobs and dials are easy to adjust and the height adjustment lever is very handy as it allows you to fine tune your settings. My only concern at this point is that the base is really small so stability might be a future issue. Will update in the future if needed.",5,1,2018-9-14,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying I like Amazon; order from them multiple times per week. So I am a fan.But this tripod was a fail for me. For a kid, or someone on a major budget this would be fine, but for anyone remotely serious or particular this photography product won't work.",2,1,2015-2-24,1,3,0
"I am a newbie photographer and didn't want to spend hundreds on a fancy tripod, so this was perfect for me.  It is light, and I am a small 19-year-old girl who can't lift very much weight, so that was nice; also, the shoulder strap used to carry it is plenty comfortable.It is easy to collapse and set-up, and has a convenient easy-release on the top so you don't have to twist your camera off every time.",4,1,2016-5-15,1,0,0
I was sceptical about ordering this as it only has review's for a camera . I purchased this for our new spotting scope and it does work . The only downside was getting the screw to tighten and hold it securely.  It was very easy to set and easy to move for different heights.  Highly recommend especially for the price .,5,1,2017-6-17,1,5,1
"Everything works acceptably except the swivel that allows rotation in a horizontal plane.  The swivel is so tight it takes two hands to rotate the head without putting excessive torque on the center post and tilting the entire tripod.  The torque required is about 0.8 foot lbs, requiring a force on the lever of about 1.7 lbs to overcome the swivel friction.A plastic bolt holds the swivel head to the center post.  A wrench can be made from a two inch section of 1/2 inch dowel rod.  Saw a slot in the center of one end about 0.13 inch wide and 0.2 inch deep.  Using this wrench to slightly loosen this bolt solves the friction problem.",3,1,2018-4-27,1,0,0
"I am satisfied with this tripod. It is light and easy to carry, yet sturdy enough when my camera is fastened on. I like having a handle to turn because sometimes all I need is an inch higher or an inch lower and I can do that with this tripod. I was also pleased to see that it came with a case. My only complaint would be that it is not a quick procedure to put my camera unto the tripod and later to remove it. The small compartment that holds the camera has to be removed by a latch.",4,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
"Looked at several comparable tripods but decided on the Amazon Basics for price.  It has the same features but for ten dollars less.  I has been using my sons tripod and one that I was comparing with and this one is almost exactly the same tripod.  The only real difference is that this has a nice handle to use while carrying tripod folded up.  Came with a lightweight case but have not needed to use it.  Overall, great product and a great value.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"One of the major attractions of this is the price. I think some of the negative reviews about quality are thus unfair. For $22.67 you can't expect top of the line, but at the same time, this is a great value.  At least for me, this is just fine for my non-professional use.  It does NOT have ANY instructions, but there are several Youtube videos on how it works, which I found very helpful.  Being instructionally challenged, I never would have figured out how to extend the legs without such help. Here's the url of what I found to be the most helpful video:  [...] Check it out, and it may help you evaluate it better if you're considering purchasing it. I've used it indoors and out, with two different cameras, and a cell phone (I got my screw on cell phone mount from Amazon, too, and it's worked fine on my Galaxy S5 with a very thick sturdy case), and have been happy with it. My Dad was a professional photographer, and I've found this to be more versatile than his 40 year old portable tripod which I have been using up to this point. Perhaps my expectations were not as high as some other purchasers, but so far it has done everything I've asked of it.",4,1,2016-2-22,1,0,0

I bough this tripod for my daughter to use to do college projects using both a digital camcorder and a 35mm camera.  It worked perfectly with both cameras.  It arrived quickly and well packaged.  This is a sturdy tripod that even survived being left out overnight in  the rain (OOOOOPS!!!!). It took minutes to set up and is fully adjustable.

"For a simple tripod this is the best tripod we've used. The tripod is sturdy and offers intuitive simplicity even for a novice photographer. We use this mostly for family photo shoots. All of the knobs and grips tighten and snap into place accordingly. We've had this tripod for a few months now and we use it at least once a week and everything still works like the day we bought it. The telescoping legs aren't flimsy and slide in and out with ease. We've had issues in the past with the swivels and knobs loosening over time, or aluminum legs bending easily but so far this one has held up better than others. The bag is pretty standard but it fits the tripod accordingly, and is sturdy enough to be lugged around in the back of our car for the past few months without tearing. There are obviously better and more expensive tripods available that have more features and perhaps a better build quality, but overall if you're not doing any upper echelon level photograph (or even if you are) I'd recommend this tripod based on price point and build quality. You won't find a better bargain for a quality tripod than this one",5,1,2017-4-14,1,1,0
"It works for being a tripod, but had a lot of sloppiness in the top mount side for any video pan/tilt. This can also be an issue with photos, since you'll struggle to get it to stay in one place, when zoomed in. As you tighten the adjustments it'll move on you. The clamp down adjustments will never fully tighten to really keep things locked down tight. I won't use it for photos or pan/tilt video because it's a struggle to adjust it and upgraded to a better tripod. This one is only used for setting an action camera on and filming time lapse etc. Can't expect too much for $25",3,1,2017-8-17,1,1,0
"I don't trust this tripod. Build quality is horrible. The neck where it extends upward wobbles all over the place, no matter how tight you tighten the collar. The brace that holds all 3 legs slipped off the shaft.The all-plastic construction doesn't suit my needs. It feels really cheap. I recently got a new lens and I'm worried about my camera either falling off the mount or falling over. I see this good for holding a flash or a light source but not a DSLR.",2,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"I was looking for an inexpensive tripod for my DSLR camera for general use and astro photography. Seeing that amazon came out with their own line of products, I decided to give this a try. While it is ""lightweight"" it does not necessarily feel cheap. The carry bag is a typical thinish light weight zippered bag. The legs lock in pretty good and I have not had any slippage issues.  The carry handle on the tripod works well and is big enough for all size hands (even gloved). I also use it to run my camera strap through for drop protection. The leveling bubbles are nice and easy to see. The rotating and tilting controls are a bit ""sticky"" if you will. Reasonable expectations here. I was not expecting it to be a professional grade mount. In order to get ""smooth"" operation, I feel like I like I have to unscrew it a bit too much. One thing i will do, as I believe another reviewer suggested, is take the head apart and sand down any rough areas and apply some sort of lubricant to the bits that contact each other. That should help smooth out operation quite a bit. The quick release base is ok. The retaining button that locks the lever open seems like it may wear quickly. The base fits in fairly snug with just a bit of wiggle. I am happy with it and I am sure I will get lots of use out of it.",5,1,2016-5-11,1,0,0
"I use this tripod to record video.  The pros are:  inexpensive, gets the job done, has multiple adjustments, has 2 bubble levels built in, and is lightweight.  I find it hard to beat for the price.  However, having said that, this is not a tripod for professional use.The cons:  flimsy material and not solidly/tightly built.  I've only had this tripod for a few weeks so I can't speak to its durability.  However, the flimsiness of the material concerns me in this regard, but you get what you pay for.  I've used the tripod in light to moderate wind, and have gotten footage that was shaky.",4,1,2018-10-17,1,0,0
"for anyone who is looking for a product to last, this is not it.  one of the locking clamps broke the first time we used it.  My husband took it apart to fix it at a volleyball tournament and all of the internal parts of the locking system on the arm are cheap plastic and rely on bent metal to hold in place.  i would not recommend this product to anyone who actually want to use a tripod for any purpose, especially not for filming sports events.

"I was looking for a tripod for my Nikon D3200.  I wanted something that would be good for landscapes and the occasional portrait.  I wanted something easily portable, so lightweight was key.  My fear was that my camera along with the lens weight might impact functionality of an inexpensive tripod, but I decided to try this one.It comes with a carrying bag, and is pretty compact.  The legs pull out with minimal effort and lock in to place.  You do not have to pull them out all of the way to lock them, so you can adjust the height.  The legs feel like they're plastic and not very strong.  I wouldn't recommend using it around kids who would bump into it, or with a very heavy camera (obviously, if you're a professional, this isn't for you.)",4,1,2013-7-23,1,1,0
"I really do like this tripod, especially compared to my original one that I lost because it collapsed too small.  This one comes with a bag and has thicker legs to it which automatically make it better than my first one. There ARE some downfalls for anyone that is a first time user for a tripod.  There are a LOT of pieces that can be adjusted on this thing.  So, I had read about someone not being able to adjust the top piece and I was a little worried because I thought the same thing happened to me, but I had to adjust another piece to get it to hold.  Once I got it down, it was super easy.The other thing that is kind of different is that the piece that attaches to the camera needs to be removed in order to attach to the camera, then you can lock it into place.  VERY nice design but you have to be able to figure it out for it to be helpful.  There are no instructions in the bag... you only get the tripod and the bag.",5,1,2015-5-13,1,0,0

I invested in a midrange video tripod with a fluid head that does a beautiful job shooting video with truly beautiful pans and tilts, but it's large and heavy.

I'm glad I get to write my 200th review on such a wonderful product!I purchased this tripod to support a Canon Digital Rebel XT with a lens as large as the 75-300mm canon telephoto to take night sky pictures. Where any slight movement would affect the quality of the image a sturdy tripod was a must. This tripod does a great job of holding the camera steady during long exposure times though if you are zoomed in close with a lense I would recommend letting it settle for a half second before hitting the shutter as it is subject to noticeable (when zoomed) vibrations right after you stop adjusting the camera.,5,1,2013-10-23,1,1,0
"When it wasn't broken, it was an ok tripod. This tripod is mainly for photography. If you want to film while using it, you can't do panning shots. They have to be static because the tripod head jitters when panning, no matter how loose the controls were. Other than that, it has all the things you'd expect. 3-pan head, two levels, etc.Why it broke is because the leg parts are made of cheap plastic. If you like run & gun photography like me, STAY AWAY from this product. This is a cheap, consumer tripod. It won't last 6 months with run & guning.",3,1,2017-5-5,1,1,0

I was pleasantly surprised at the weight of this tripod.  It feels like a quality product.  It's heavy and well built for a quality product.  The shoe is compatible with my other tripod of a different brand.  When you pick up the tripod with a DSLR camera, the camera does not make the tripod topheavy at all.  This thing is well built, and well balanced, and well worth the price I paid.  I would recommend, and would definitely buy this again should I ever need to.  My only complaint?  The carrying bag seems to be a bit thin for my liking.  But we'll see how it works out.",5,1,2017-1-7,1,1,0
"I had high hopes that this tripod would get me through my introductory photography class before I invested in something sturdier, but it didn't even last two months before one of the legs came off!

I'm going to see what Amazon might do to exchange it?",2,1,2017-11-18,1,2,0
I like this tripod a lot.It has every adjustment you could possibly want.  It has a detachable mount which is really helpful.  The legs fully extend with ease and the leveling bubbles work great to help keep the camera straight.  It has a hook as well so you can hang this tripod upside down.  This is truly lightweight which is nice but it also feels a bit overwhelmed when using a bigger camera so watch when using a longer lens.,4,1,2015-7-5,1,0,0
"I didn't want to spend a fortune on a 60"" tripod, but wish I would have spent a little more.  If lightweight is more of a requirement than sturdiness, this is the product for you.  Very light, but I would not rate this a sturdy product.  This is a nice enough tripod for the money as long as you're on a flat surface with no requirement to use the swivel function.  I don't like leaving my cameras unattended on this tripod - not very sturdy and I feel like a small bump would cause this tripod to collapse.  Also the swivel joints do not work well - they are very rigid and not very fluid.  Even after I lubricated these joints they still don't function as well as I'd like.If you're looking for a lightweight tripod to hold a point and shoot or DSLR steady with you standing behind it, guarding it, it's a good product.  If you're looking for a stable tripod to use with a video camera (to swivel) or a heavier DSLR on uneven surfaces, spend a little more.",3,1,2013-12-31,1,1,0
"So this is not a pro tripod. But you knew that already. That said, it's a good, full-featured tripod that will make 99% of users happy. If you want to mount a point-and-shoot or mirrorless camera, this is your go-to apparatus. It's simple, well-designed, and does exactly what you want it to do. If you want to mount anything heavier--say, an SLR with a largish lens or medium-format film camera, look to something more substantial and more costly. This tripod is fine for my mirrorless system and lighter SLR, but when I mounted my medium-format film camera to it, the limitations were quite obvious. It simply doesn't have the heft or tension required to keep a heavy camera stable for a long shoot. That said, you can certainly use it for heavier cameras, but don't leave it unattended; the weight of heavier cameras will cause the mount to tilt. All in all, a wonderful device for amateurs or as a back-up for pros. You certainly can't beat the price, and honestly, I'm impressed by its ergonomics and ease of use. (I also like that it comes with a case, which is no small thing.) Really, unless you're a pro with a heavy rig (five pounds plus) this things is a no-brainer.",5,1,2014-10-7,1,0,0

As well as the slider piece you don't have to keep unscrewing and screwing it back into the tripod which has to be my favorite part of the whole tripod. Overall, great price for the money.

This is awesome! I've owned 2 tripods before both were less than $20 on eBay. My last one broke so I thought I would just buy another. I had an amazing gift card so I decided to try amazon instead of eBay. This was about the same price as my last one and wow. The quality was a huge difference. I miss not profesional and just occasionally film videos so I didn't need an expensive profesional one but this one is SO nice. I just assumed it was going to be the same as the eBay one and this one is much sturdier and actually feels profesional. I absolutely love it. If it every breaks I would definitely re buy the same one.,5,1,2018-5-10,1,0,0

The gray legs match the space gray color of my Ipad. It works cool for photos. The only gripe I've got is its not any good for fluid videography. The panning from left to right, side to side isn't smooth. It chops/jerks too much no matter what lubricant I put on or how slack the knob tension is I think its because these are plastic pieces linked together as opposed to metal of the heavy weight tripods.

"It's a really basic tripod for a beginner in photography, not much else to say. So far it shifts pretty easy, and will swivel quite nicely, however none of the knobs really lock into place, and can be move with some force. The levels for the mount and the legs are a surprising addition but definitely help with set-up. The 6 ft maximum height was shocking but will never likely be used due to stability concerns. Overall if you are just starting out and don't know if you intend to make photography a hobby, or you just want something to hold your smart phone steady, this'll do. But if you actually intend on getting a DSLR and multiple lenses that will end up weighing around 15+ pounds then get a higher quality tripod.

It's handy that the plate for the camera slides out. It's much easier to attach the cemera to the plate and slide it back on.  Lots of adjustability. Leg adjusters are easy to use.

"This is a great tripod and it's most definitely better than having nothing. I quickly got into photography and learned a lot and eventually I came across one problem - it's not very stable when nearing its maximum height.I'm about six feet tall, and in order for me to comfortably look through the tripod without uncomfortably hunching over, I need to extend all three legs and crank up a straight pole that brings the camera nearly to my face. If I don't crank up the pole, the tripod is much more stable but it goes up to my chest. When I do crank up the pole, it feels a little less stable than I wish it was. I'm no professional, and I repeat - I am no pro so please spare me my ignorance - but I found myself struggling a bit to take some images.

But i have to say that it is flimsy, not in a its fragile kind if way but it feels cheap. You're definitely getting what you pay for here. Functionality, not heirloom quality or professional quality. The legs lock solid and the head swivels and tilts as it should and is light weight.",3,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0
This is the best tripod I have used with my Canon T6 camera and it is by far the cheapest. This is made very well and it is lightweight enough to take with on hikes! I bring this everywhere with me and it is amazing! It even has a hook in the middle of it to weight it down if it is too windy. Very well thought out design!,5,1,2017-5-16,1,2,0
"I bought this thinking it would be light weight and durable.  NOT light weight, and not durable.  I haven't used it many times, but I'm sure the mount will break first, and probably soon.  Feels like if you make one wrong move it'll snap.  It's not heavy, but it weights just as much as my manfrotto fluid head tripod that is far sturdier.  Buy this only if you don't have money for a better tripod.",3,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
I really love this tripod. It's so easy to use and really versatile. It has features that I didn't even know I needed or wanted. Very easy to set up and put away. It does exactly as it says. Very sturdy. I would buy this many times over. The only reason I won't give it a full five stars is that I have a Sony NEX 5T camera and when mounting it on the mount the peg to screw it on doesn't rise out of the mount head enough for me  so my camera is a little wobbly and I'm afraid it may fall off if I were to rotate it to the floor or up at the ceiling for any reason. I'm sure there is a quick fix or even I could be putting it up there wrong but overall this tripod is a solid 4.9 for me.,4,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"I looked at other options for stands and am very happy with this choice. Fact is, I could have spent more. For what I need (n-studio, indoor usage, with little moving around), these are going to be perfect for me at a fraction of the cost of a more capable stand. If I were looking to do a lot of mobile shooting, then I'd probably look for a more rugged rig. The stands also include a small level, which I thought was a nice touch.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
"The handle for vertical panning immediately fell off along with the nut and bolt when I unpacked it.

The reviews must've been true"" but then I sat there fiddling with the nozzles thinking ""why would they make a tripod that's literally great except for the most important part (where the cam goes) so I keep fiddling with the nozzles tightning and loosening still not fixing the problem,,, until I thought to tighten the actual handle and sure enough it was for the loose top!

"This is actually a pretty decent Tripod, especially at this price point, I was taking a gamble when I bought it and was pleasantly surprised. It has a solid build, though the plastic parts could be a little better, not that they are bad, but I do feel I got to be a little extra careful when clipping things down, thus one star off (it’s really not as bad as I’m making it out to be, being overly critical) overall I’m happy with this tripod, I’ve had it over a month now and no problems and I can see it lasting for awhile, I’ll update if anything happens to go wrong",4,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"Here is why I am giving it three stars. This tripod gets the job done, it will hold your camera still, tilts, moves, tightens (a little much - read further), changes height -- all of it. First off, I ordered this in conjunction with the Amazon Basics sling photography backpack, with a tripod holder - this (AMAZONBASICS) Tripod barely fits in the holder, and by barely fits I mean, I put the holding clip to the maximum while only one leg can fit in the tripod holder base. My next run in, I wanted to take some boardwalk photos and sunset photos at the beach. Mind you, not once did I leave the tripod sitting on the ground - the only parts touching the ground were the legs. Sand that was just blowing on a standard day I guess got caught in every single notch of the tripod, and now will barely tighten or loosen. When I packed up the tripod (tightened so that it wouldn't move around) I now need to carry a wrench with me to loosen and tighten. For the price you pay, it is questionable for the quality you get. I'm no pro-photographer, but come on you know this product isn't just going to be inside all the time. And Amazon should match it with their other similar products.",3,1,2015-11-30,1,0,0
"This lightweight tripod packs in the features at an affordable price point.  Despite it's light weight it is super sturdy and has enough heft in the legs to not feel flimsy or cheap.  My camera feels secure and the leveling bubble, rubber rotating feet and handle make it easy to adjust and find the most secure setup in all situations. I do youtube videos at home and on the road and take lots of stills and videos while camping.  I've also used it to mount an outdoor projector for movies while camping.  I'm going to order another one of these to keep in the camper because it works great for that and still keeps a small and light footprint for packing it up. This shipped fast and was to my door in 2 days. I'm very pleased with this tripod and think it's a great value.",5,1,2016-12-6,1,0,0

"We used it about 3 times and then the sliding mechanism and the locks just got stuck on each other and broke. We got a friendly return of course because Amazon is awesome.

I bought this tripod so I could use it with a portable projector that I just bought.  The tripod is really nice and works pretty well.  I was able to connect it to the projector and it is pretty stable.  I have been using it inside the house and in the backyard and it is pretty stable.  It is a pretty good tripod at a very reasonable price.  I would definitely recommend it.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,1
When I received the product it was missing the top part where you secure your camera to it. Pretty useless without that. Also I noticed a corner of the plastic up top was broken or nicked somehow so it may have been used already. It was light as paper- can’t be very sturdy so I don’t know why all the great reviews other than price. Also I put it back in the bag to return it and it was super hard to get it into the bag so that’s frustrating. Thankful for being able to return.,2,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I like this tripod.  It's very study and you can get it to a good height.  We have taken photos with our iPhones mounted on it (we purchased a separate cell phone tripod adaptor and bluetooth remote) and all of these pieces have helped us get better photos quicker than just positioning your phone on something and using the timer.  Also, I think it'll work well for video conferencing with friends and family, so you don't have to hold the phone the whole time.  It comes with a handy carrier, which is nice, as I didn't really realize how large this tripod was.",4,1,2018-2-17,1,0,0
"There are many reasons to get a tripod. I am a beginner photographer and wanted to have a tripod to use for a few different scenarios. The first is for those times when you want to make sure your camera is absolutely still. So if you are taking a picture outside in lower light and want to use a longer shutter speed or if you are indoors in a lower light situation. you can take more pictures without the flash, yet keep a very steady image. This is a good lightweight tripod for those instances. It comes with it's own bag, you can set it up in minutes and has levels built-in to the device to make sure you are setting up your shots perfectly.The other situation is if you want to use the timer or the remote to take self portraits. Much easier to get yourself in the picture with the right height and distance. Works in the house but is light enough that you can carry it with you hiking. While I have used it outside a few times since purchasing, you need to make sure the ground is fairly level. The feet just don't have a lot of grip on to use with much slope. If I was going to do a lot of outdoor photography, I would look at tripod with spikes in the feet.",5,1,2014-12-7,1,1,0
"Great quality for the price!This is a great beginner/ starter/ back up/ hiker tripod! Obviously the price is good, but in this case it does not mean it is a total piece of junk either; on the contrary. Of course there are many more expensive and more solid tripods out there but this one is pretty darn solid for what it is, especially for the price. So if you are not shooting in extreme conditions, this works great! It is also fairly light, and packs reasonably small, so this could be a good hiker edition as well.",5,1,2016-12-10,1,0,0
"I've never had a tripod so nice - and for the PRICE!!!  It's adjustable every single way, legs extend easily, things tighten easily, setup to the camera was easy, came with a NICE BAG, and there's not just one but TWO bubbles for level.  If I ever get one of those honking long lenses for my camera...this has something to hang weight from in the center of the tripod to keep it from tipping over.  All that with a handy grip to just grab this and move it or go.  It is PERFECT!  I am loving it!",5,1,2017-7-24,1,1,0
Surprisingly nice for the money. I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I wanted to a tripod that was sturdy. It turns out this fit the bill. Does just what I need for the price. Work smoothly and stays where you set it.,5,1,2019-11-14,1,1,0

The other one I bought at the same price point was flimsy and too light so a small gust of wind knocked it and my mounted camera to the pavements.  ouch.

Adjusting is a bit clunky, so it takes a bit of playing around to get the position you want.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
I am well beyond the days of hanging a seven pound camera on a tripod.  Most of my work is done either with my iPhone or a very small (by comparison) video camera.

It is easy and quick to set up and stays where I put it unless I need it to move.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
This is great if you are on a budget and/or beginner in the field. Every moving part is sturdy and it has a very basic level.

"Have had this tripod for a while now and it hasn't broken yet, so i guess it's pretty okay on durability despite feeling like the plastic pieces could break at any moment.  Attaching the camera is simple and easy.  It does have a bubble level on it which is handy.BUT... it doesn't rotate smoothly.  There's a small area of rotation (abt 5-10°) where it's pretty loose and rotates freely but then hits a tight spot and you have to really force it to rotate further, leaving you with a very jerky, hard to watch soccer game of your son.  Loosened every adjustable part on it and nothing helps.  Even lubed up every moving part on this thing but to no avail.  If you don't need to pan your camera left or right and can just leave it stationary, this would do fine.

While surfing Amazon I ran across the Amazon Basics brand and watched the YouTube video on a listing and after watching it I thought I would give their tripod a try.  This was certainly a good idea, from my research I found out the lighter weight tripods cost more and if the tripod was multi functional that would raise the price again. This tripod has a the ability to work with the leg extended or not and is made from aluminum so it is light weight.

Incredibly light weight and easy to carry.  The included carrying bag is a bonus!  The legs easily raise or lower simply by pulling open or pushing shut a locking lever.  The additional telescopic raising with the hand crack is perfect for fine tune height adjustments.  Bubble level makes it easy to get a perfect setup on stairs or new em ground!

I've owned many tripods for both cameras as well as telescopes. This tripod has everything but an electric control port which is only good for star gazing. It also has a leveler so your camera is in the correct position for ALL of your shots. Nothing to tighten by screwing only to become loose later on. All are snap clamps that hold their position tightly. My next door neighbor is a professor at a local college and has taught photography for the last 25 years.

Relatively straight forward tripod. There are little plastic clips on the legs to log in adjustments and these are the weak point of the tripod. First round using it and the top clip broke off.

Even without instructions, the design was intuitive; absolutely one of the best engineered products I've ever bought.  Stable, easy to manipulate, solid construction.  I was able to easily attach the iPad holder I also bought from Amazon.  This tripod also folds up securely to fit in the provided bag, although you really don't need the bag since there is an ingenious built in handle.  I can't see anyway this product could be improved.  At this price, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I guess professional or highly skilled amateur photographers may want some additional doodads on their tripod but the swivel head works just fine, the universal screw for attaching things like iPads is solid.

And when I took it out from its case to click a landscape picture of the canyon, I found that the handle used for controlling the angle of the camera had come off the tripod along with a nut. Given the relative complexity to fix it, I missed the opportunity to capture the sunset and I was there at the canyon for only a day. Later when I tried to put the nut back in to its place (at the very deep end of the plastic casing), the curved plastic broke off as I was stretching it to make enough space to push the nut.I am very disappointed with the quality of the product.",1,1,2018-9-1,1,1,0

"I wanted a basic tripod for use on a trip to the Southwest where I took a photography course.  It had to be lightweight and durable and provide good support in some rugged locations.  I used it with a fairly hefty Canon DSLR.  I was very pleased with this Amazon product.  It is lighter in weight than a carbon fiber tripod that my friend has that cost 5 times more.  It has two spirit levels that are handy for leveling the camera.  The feet are good for outdoor or indoor use.  The quick release is convenient, secure  and easy to use, again much better than the much higher priced unit.  If you want, you can carry the camera around atop the tripod.  The legs are easy to extend and adjust with individual levers rather than the twist locks found on other  tripods.  Perhaps the only defect I can find in the tripod is that the legs do not open as wide as some other tripods which means that it may be a little less stable in a strong wind.  However, it has a sliding brace that opens with the tripod and helps to stabilize it.  The brace has a hook that can be used to hang a weight such as a camera bag which further stabilizes the tripod.  It is remarkable how much value has been packed into this device.  The bag is handy and durable.  I recommend this tripod  highly.",5,1,2012-10-20,1,2,0
"For the price, its not a bad tripod, but keep you expectations in check. Overall the build quality is just so-so. It is well featured, but feels a little cheap all around. The pivots used to pan and angle the camera feel a bit stiff even with the locks threaded all the way out (maybe they will loosen with time). I also had to trim some excess plastic off of the bushing that the center telescoping shaft rides on as a piece of it would scratch up against the teeth making a real annoying noise when raising or lowering the boom. Minor sure, but gives you an idea of the fit finish and QC on the product.For the $20 price I paid though, not all that bad for my intended use (holding a gopro up in the garage for some video capture).

(Yes, I know they make tripods designed specifically for hunting, but they are much more expensive.)I've only taken it out with me once, but for the price, this tripod seems pretty sturdy and everything functions as you would expect it to.",5,1,2017-11-27,1,1,0
"This is perfect for beginners or people that just need one for point and shoot stuff. It would also be really good for vlogging. It's not SUPER sturdy so I sometimes worry about my DSLR on it, especially with larger lenses on it - this results in me often just taking low shots with it and sitting on the ground because it's sturdier when it's shorter. I plan on getting a nicer one as my skill and interest increases but this has been perfect for learning and doing very basic photography. The price is great for leaners! This is not great for long exposures. If you plan on filming something where you need to pan, it doesn't do that well. You can't precisely pan it very well, so be aware of that. You also can't precisely line it up to things, it doesn't move very smoothly. This is definitely a basic, as it says in the title.",5,1,2015-7-30,1,0,0
This tripod fails at the primary level of keeping the camera platform steady. Every contact point has movement and flexes at modest pressure. The head and plate area is the worst (see video clip). On the plus side it is very light. Minus: completely unusable as a tripod.,1,1,2019-7-18,1,1,0
"Excellent weight for packing around while hunting. Was able to place my Bino adapter right on to the base plate, and hold both my Nikon and Bushnell binos with no problems at all. Also no issues holding my Bushnell spotting scope. Easy to adjust legs to height needed, weather it be sitting down or standing up. It is sturdier than I thought it would be. It was pretty quite when setting up and taking down. Sure I'd recommend this tripod to other hunters! All and all a good little product here. Believe it will stand up for a few years to come.  Again great weight for packing around when ya are already hauling some 65 to 70 lbs., of gear with ya.",5,1,2016-7-15,1,1,0
"This tripod is amazing. I've had it for many many months (forgot to do a review). But it has many different levels! From low placement near the ground, to nearly head level. Once you extend the legs fully out, it has a twisty lever you twist where the camera goes, and it almost reaches my height! Im 5'8 by the way. So its definitely 60 inches/5ft. It's very durable and looks professional as well. I'd recommend a hundred times! :)",5,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0
"This is an excellent tripod! There are a lot of features on this that I wasn't even expecting but I absolutely appreciate. It has a handle so that if you want to move the tripod with your whatever attached to it, It makes it so much simpler to make a move and you feel more secure to move your camera, Camcorder, telescope,…, whatever.  It has a crank to raise and lower the center pole/head up-and-down  which is much more convenient than the free flow with a knob to tighten, especially if you only need to  make a minimal move.  It also has a lock on the riser pole and the brace for the legs to keep them in place and makes it much sturdier. It also has swivel feet that is great if you're not on an even surface.  I bought this to replace the flimsy tripod that came with my Celestetron 70 travel scope and i'm glad I did.",5,1,2017-1-18,1,0,1
"This is a great little lightweight tripod. I have used it several times and seems to be quite sturdy. The legs extend easily, and the two levels allow you to make sure you are not at an angle when taking the picture. Buyer should be aware this tripod is very light, as such it is not one that you can leave unattended where there may be a chance of someone knocking it over. The tripod does have a hook that you can hang something to weigh it down a bit, but for the shoots, I use this for it is unnecessary. So for the photographer that is on a budget, I highly recommend this tripod.",5,1,2018-4-19,1,0,0
I made this purchase fairly quickly. Upon arrival I couldn’t figure out how to attach this to my phone. I was looking for other reviews similar to mine and couldn’t find too many because most people are using this tripod to mount digital cameras 📷.

"I bought this tripod because I forgot my good tripod at home.  I didn't expect much for the price, but it worked fine for still photography. Don't buy it if you want to shot videos because the head does not move smoothly. Besides that, I was satisfied with my purchase.  It is lightweight and easy to operate.  I found that the mechanism that raises and lowers the main shaft didn't lock into place very well.  This tripod is definitely not for the hardcore photographer. If you plan on taking a lot of pictures and want something that lasts, invest in a much better tripod.",3,1,2016-8-23,1,1,0
"This is by far the best Tripod I've had... It is very stable. I am giving 3 stars ONLY because it came with the PLATE broken.

I've been using this tripod successfully for at-least 3 years. The very first thing I did was attach a 6lb sand weight to the middle by a tether that floats above the ground to lower the center of gravity. A heavier DSLR would easily get knocked over without adding the weight. I use the bubble levels and adjust the legs/height often. Great for the price.,5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"The lightweight tripod is just the thing for my Canon DSLR which is not all that heavy. The tripod is very sturdy and has locks for virtually all of the degrees of freedom. This is an excellent feature, and it was missing from the tripod that this replaces. There are two spirit levels that are very useful for totally leveling the camera.If I were to complain, and it is really minor, it is that the rack and pinion assembly that cranks the camera up and down feels a little crude. It was much more refined in the tripod that this replaces. Again, this is a very minor complaint because the rest of the tripod has many refined features.",5,1,2015-9-16,1,0,0

It was the lowest price that still resembled quality. I am happy with the purchase. It came with a carrying bag. It’s my first so I may not know much about them but looks and feels great and extends very tall.

I had to purchase a spring loaded phone holder (no big deal) but there is NO screw in adapter for this as pictured!!While there is a slight misleading line that the adapter is not included, it should say “screw in adapter for phone holder not included”.",1,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0
"Works well as a budget tripod. Includes a hook to add a ballast weight (pouch of sand or rocks) to keep steady in windy conditions.  The handle is another nice touch, though not important if toted in the accompanying bag, which has a nice strap.  OK for stationary video shots, but the pan and tilt are not ""liquid"" for smooth tracking.  This unit is lighter than many 60-inch tripods, but not something you'd want to carry on extended treks.  If you want something that will fit in a backpack, look for something smaller.",5,1,2017-9-15,1,1,0
"Happy with this product! I ended up gifting one and keeping the other. I've had it for about a year now and it's holding up nicely. I have to say I haven't used it a TON, but I've used it enough to know if it's a piece of junk. It's a great deal for what it is and I'd recommend buying it.",5,1,2019-3-31,1,1,0
This is everything I needed it to be and more. I had never used a tripod before but it was definitely easy enough to figure out how to use it. Enough mechanisms on it to be able to get your camera in any position you want it to be in. Love the easy release piece really makes life easy for some things great value for price. Easy to store take out and put away and definitely light enough to whip around,5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"This is a great value in a tripod purchase. It is very light weight, sturdy enough for my needs, and i can see using this for a very long time.  I primarily use this for a small video camera and a DSLR.  This is used for my childrens sporting events, and does the job fantastically.  I know it seems wierd using a tripod for sports, however, they run track, so the tripod really does come in handy to hold the camera steady as they go around the track, or to keep a wide shot set, while i use a different camera for still shots.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0

Really, really, really good though.",4,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"Nothing monumentally life changing. Is definitely made of cheap materials and isnt super solid feeling, but I only needed something to stick a camera on for interview type purposes.

The handle really helps when you are trying to use it as a monopod so that's a plus. Another thing I liked about this product is how it spins in a circle so when I am filming, I could easily spin to get a spinning shot without any trouble. The spin is very steady. Another thing that I like about this is the long handle, it comes in handy for two things: one is obviously spinning and adjusting to the frame, second is it allows you to hold mic that is connected to your camera. I love how it came with a bag. Perfect for traveling!",5,1,2016-2-19,1,0,0

I have a lightweight Panasonic G85, and even with a TINY micro four thirds 25mm prime lens (thing weights like 1/10th of a pound...) the head would tilt forward on me.

"The tripod is a great price and fairly well made for light use. BUT, if you are using this on a daily basis, and/or in a rough environment, you will most likely get about 6 months to a year out of it. I'm a union carpenter and have seen these tripods all over jobsites. It is rare to find one that still has the little knob on the crank (pictured). Mine recently came off and I was able to reattach it with what I had available. Today, a rivet on one of the legs came off (also pictured) and I might just retire it for something more sturdy.

For the price, I don't know, I feel that it's worth spending a bit more money to get a better one. I do like the height adjustment on it and how sturdy the legs are, plus it's lightweight. However, the pitch adjustment lever fell put of its socket after about an hour of having it and the piece was gooey, wet, gross glue or something as if they just glued it together.

I've taken it on six vacations, including 2 out of country, where the tripod was packed in my suitcase and checked on the plane. Not one part has broken. It's light-weight and works great. The product literature says it is 60 inches high, but I measured it at 62 inches when fully opened from floor to head plate where the camera rests. The legs telescope in and out of each other smoothly and easily. This tripod has two bubble levels on it. One is on the shoulder of one of the legs, and the other is on the head of the tripod. I think this tripod was engineered really well. Watch my review of this tripod on Youtube by PsychOtto.",5,1,2018-4-18,1,0,1

It's not often I get to be in pictures with my friends during group shots, because I am usually behind the camera... but now I can be! I have the Sony a6000 which allows you to connect to your phone so you can see what the camera sees and then like a remote you can take the picture.

"I've given this tripod 4 stars based on what I bought it for: A light travel tripod.  Some of the nice features are a quick release camera mount, quick release leg clamps, two bubble levels and a hook at the base of the center column to hang something heavy to add some stability to the tripod.  I've tried this out at full leg extension with a Nikon D7000 with a 18-105 lens and about 3 lbs of extra hanging from the center hook while I took three bracketed shots which I later merged them together.  It tips the scale at mere 2.7 lbs compared to the 12 lbs of my Bogen 3040 tripod.  The Bogen can easily handle a heavy camera with a heavy telephoto in gusty winds (which I wouldn't try with AmazonBasics) but it will break your back lugging it around while hiking.  One small problem I've had is a grommet at the base of central column like to pop off when pull out the legs.",4,1,2015-9-5,1,0,0
Ok folks so I’m no pro but I totally look like one now!! This is the real deal it adjusts in every possible direction and is incredibly easy to use! Amazingly durable and is also totally not intimidating. I was worried when I ordered it that I may have trouble using it.. boy was I wrong! It is so straightforward that you don’t have to be a pro but will totally look like one with out the high price!!

"For the price, this is a really good tripod that can handle all the basic uses. It balances well and I really like how high it can go. The height allowance is good. In my opinion, this tripod provides the best usage as a camera stand. It can panel from left to right or vice versa, but this function is not the smoothest. This is especially apparent if you are going from side to side at a slow rate. Other than that, everything else about this tripod stand is quite outstanding.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"Overall this seems like a good tripod for the price. I am using it to hold a spotting scope, which isn’t too heavy. It’s a little wobbly, but it is as good as I expected, and I haven’t tried hanging any weight from the hook underneath. My one complaint so far is the panning is sticky, even with the screw loosened all the way. There is just too much friction in the plastic parts that allow it to move side to side, so it is hard to move smoothly when looking through the scope.",4,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0

"This is a perfect entry level tripod. I have owned a number of different tripods over the years and this one would be placed at the top of the list for it's price to feature ratio. For me, height was a big factor. I am 6' 3"" tall and I prefer a tripod that doesn't make me bend over too far because I have a bad back. This tripod allows me to take the shots I want to take without the need to bend down far. In addition, there are two different levels built in to the unit...one for the legs and another for the pan head...making it very easy to get a level shot. It's fairly easy to lock in to the perfect position, though it does take a bit of effort if you want it to be precise...especially when using a telescope lens. I bought this to take some photos of the ""super moon"" on Sunday and after testing it out on tonight's moon, I am very pleased with my purchase. The carrying bag is also a great bonus! I would recommend this tripod to anyone who is just starting out in photography/videography or for those who just want a nice hobby tripod. No, it's not a high-end, fluid movement tripod like you find in cinematography, but then again, it also doesn't cost hundreds or even thousands! I attached a photo of the moon I took using this tripod. As you can see, it holds it nice and steady when you need to leave the shutter open a little longer.

I haven't had it long enough to really put it through it's paces yet but at first use it's a feature rich, competent tripod for the money.  Sometimes you have to backpack into places that you don't want (or dare) take a tripod that costs hundreds, but still you need something solid and usable.  This is it.

"I was initially very pleased with this tripod, and impressed by the extra thought that went into the design as far as features go, but one of the plastic locking pieces within one of the legs broke after about 5-6 months, and now it’s mostly useless as a tripod with height (why I bought it in the first place) with only two extendable legs. I missed the window for return (it just wasn’t a priority during the pandemic). I’d consider buying this again if I wasn’t worried that inner plastic piece might fail again. Other than that, it’s decent quality for the price, and easy to use. I especially like the height, leveling bubbles, and detachable mount, which made my tasks easier and more efficient.

The camera easily screws onto the clip that attaches to the tripod.We love taking group family photos at special gatherings (christmas, birthdays). It's so nice not having to build a makeshift tripod with tables and chairs or, even worse, having someone take the picture and get left out!

"I'm just getting into the hobby of photography and I quickly realized I need a tripod. I shopped around and found this to be a good option for the price range I'm looking for. I've never used a tripod before and this didn't come with any instructions. However, it's really easy to use and easy to understand. I figured it out within minutes and have had no problem with it so far. It fits my Nikon D3300 perfectly and it works really well. It's a great deal for the price. It's stable, sturdy, and I love that it came with a carrying case. It's light and it has been able to go all the way up to 60 inches as advertised. I'm beginning to think Amazon is on to something again here. They're beginning to produce affordable quality products on their own, a total game changer.",5,1,2016-1-9,1,0,0
"For the price, this might be the best inexpensive tripod you can buy! Even when compared to some inexpensive tripods you can buy in retailers like Best Buy, the build quality of this tripod surpasses them by far.Most cheap tripods are entirely made of hardened plastic where as this one includes aluminum all over the place. The mount where your camera sits is very sturdy which is great but sometimes when panning left and right, it can get stuck even though the bolt is loosened.",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"I don't think I have ever written a review before. But, I feel compelled to do so with this product. I just opened the package, and I cannot believe the quality of this product. It is way beyond what I expected for $20. Now, I am not a professional photographer. So, I'm sure the snooty crowd would stick their noses up. But, I personally can't find a thing lacking for the hobbyist. I like to take bird and wildlife photos from my deck or even from my kitchen window. Because of my arthritis, I find it difficult to hold my Nikon L820 steady while zooming. So, this will help tremendously.We had a more heavy-duty tripod that my husband bought years ago when we got our first video camera (one of those bulky heavy ones who hold on your shoulder). It was cumbersome for me to move that thing around for the kind of shooting I do nowadays. But, this new one is lightweight, has a neat carrying handle, pivots easily in all directions, even has a built-in level. The carrying bag is good quality as well. I couldn't ask for a better bang for my buck.",5,1,2013-12-5,1,1,0
"Pretty good for the money. I bought this for my daughter to use and didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that might get just few uses and end up in the closet. For the money it is pretty good quality. If stretched to the max it does feel axbut flimsy,  but that is expected when you look at the thickness of the legs. It does handle a DSLR camera pretty good, also works well with a DJI Osmo 2. I would definitely recommend it for the occasional photographer.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0

"These tripods are awesome. They are light, well made, and inexpensive. I actually bought these to make 2 floor lamps, and they turned out great. They are sturdy and I can adjust the height! And with this 2-pack, they were only $20 each, which I think is a downright bargain! They came with 2 carrying bags that I'll never use, but I'm sure they would be handy for a photographer on the go. My only complaint is that the tripods were pretty hard to take apart. That's only a gripe from my perspective, though- it actually is a testament to how durable these will actually be out in the field!",5,1,2018-10-4,1,1,1
"OMG I love my tripod so much I can't stop using it!!! All the sudden I love taking pictures! I originally bought this to setup in my salon to take pictures of the services I provide but soon enough I used this for every occasion and place I visit.

"This is lightweight, comes with a carry bag and worked well when I was shooting stars over the fourth of july weekend 2016. It comes with a variety of neat adjustments. There is even a hook to hang accessories in the underside middle of the tripod which can be used to hang accessories or a weighted bag to make this even more stable. I will add that I shot over 750 photos with this on the first time using this, with 30 second exposures. The wind was minimal, basically negating any potential issues with wind and slight movement of the tripod but I was prepared just in case.For the price, this is heck of a deal.",5,1,2016-7-19,1,0,0

"This is a very versatile tripod for simple photography needs. When it comes to tripods, especially for professional work, the heavier the tripod, the better. However, for simple stuff, like stuff I need, this fits the bill. It is very adjustable, and despite its light weight, it's pretty sturdy. The light weight is also nice for lugging around, but I don't need to do that too much. The carry handle seems a bit pointless since there's not enough room for me to get my fingers around it, but that's about my only nit. It also features the detachable mount which I actually don't like since it's easy to lose. Well, it's easy for me to lose. I much rather the mount just stay fixed to the tripod, because if you lose it, you're screwed. You can't use the tripod. Other than that, it's great and the price is definitely right.",3,1,2013-12-18,1,1,0

"Most people use a phone to take photos or videos.  Why would you leave out the most important aspect of a tripod,namely the smart phone attachment.  There were no instructions, nothing when the product arrived so I thought I got a defective piece.  Only after returning it and getting another identical one, did I read the fine print that said this attachment was not included.  Argh!!!!!! Infuriating.",4,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Solid tripod for the money. Pretty sturdy, lightweight metal and plastic construction. Many features and adjustments including several levels to make sure the camera is level when shooting. Digital camera is held solid. The tripod came with a nice carrying case but no directions. Make sure you take off the black plastic mounting plate using the release lever and use the screw in the mounting plate to attach the plate to the camera. There underside of the mounting plate has a hook which you can twist to attach it to the camera with the mounting screw. I tried to attach the camera to the the plate while still attached to the tripod and the metal spring loaded stabiliation button popped out of the plate. I had to reinsert with pliers. Took a few minutes to get back in. Once I removed the mounting plate from the tripod attaching it to the digital camera was simple. Then you simply reinsert the plate back onto the tripod and secure with the lever. As you probably guessed I never used a real tripod before. I am using it to record 8mm movies from projector onto the digital camera. I think it will definitely be very useful.",4,1,2013-11-28,1,0,0
Our family is making videos every day and we use the tripod almost every time. We’ve purchased cheaper ones that eventually broke at one of the axis points and at the camera quick connect. These handles and axis are incredible smooth and are sturdy. I don’t have to worry about breaking it if I turn too tightly.It fits very well in the canvas bag. Very big fan of this econimical tripod.,5,1,2018-3-23,1,1,0
Nice tripod but not sturdy enough when theres a slight breeze. I added weight to it when I'm taking pictures and that helps. The stance could be a little wider since there was times I thought my camera was going to fall over. Overall its great on flat surfaces but not so much on uneven surfaces. As a simple trip for light use its great.,4,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0

"This is a decent Tripod for the money.  When I removed the quick release from the tripod to attach it to the underside of my camera, the small, spring-loaded button on the tripod popped out.  As far as I can tell, it isn't held into the tripod with much more than the outer edges of this little square button.  After picking them up off the floor (the square button and the spring), I carefully re-attached them and applied a small piece of scotch tap, loosely, over this pop-up button so that it would go flying apart again.  Hey, this is a $25 tripod, not a $100 one.  The legs and all locking mechanisms work well.  I'm likin' it even though it is ""wanting"" in it's construction.  It's good enough for me though I'll ""baby"" it.",4,1,2015-2-21,1,1,0
"This is a good tripod, FOR ITS PRICE. What it means is that it's not a Manfrotto or high end tripod, and though it's well built, it's not as robust as a more expensive tripod would be. It fits my needs quite well, but for shoots in windy or rugged conditions, I have a heavy duty tripod that would work better for my uses. Still, I've done some great long exposure night images with it and if there's no wind, or wind less than 5mph and not gusty, this is a nice tripod, especially when I travel.",4,1,2018-4-13,1,0,0

"This is the best purchase I have ever made with my entire photography life.  I am so tired of always being behind the scene for each and every occasions I have photographed.  I have always been complemented with my photos, but there are days I wished I was with the people I love for memories to keep and to behold.I have brought this on our trip to Vegas.  I agree, with all other photographers, that it's a must-have.  It keeps the pictures sharper without the blur/noise especially on low light conditions.  The framework of the tripod is well-built making it sturdy even on mild windy conditions.  It's well-worth the price.  I actually had my sister purchase one for herself too.  She was equally impressed how well this tripod stood the test of usage.",5,1,2015-1-23,1,2,0

This lightweight tripod is perfect for my needs as I just started using a new Canon T6 DLSR for my hobby.  I needed something that had lots of adjustments and yet was easy to use as well as coming in a lightweight bag.

"I bought the Joby Grip Tight Mount to mount it on top of this tripod so that i can take photos with my smartphone and both the stand and the mount meet my needs. The tripod is very light and sturdy, the bag that comes with it is also a great part of it. I literally made a 5 minute movie all by myself with the tripod and mount.I wont recommend buying this tripod for heavier cameras because it does have a weight limit. Ive notice that after a while the knobs to adjust the angles of your device start to not get grip when you tighten them all the way, so this means there is space when you try tighten the knob that stops the tripod from turning 360 degrees. Its hard to explain but when you get the tripod youself you well find out. Other then that i recommend this tripod for people that want to use there phones on the tripod and who dont want to pay much fpr a good tripod.",4,1,2014-1-31,1,0,0

It has also survived some brief moments of toddler curiosity  unscathed! All for less than $30!! I couldn’t ask for a better price for this.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"I bought two of these as cheap tripods for my speedlights with umbrella (I'm always looking for a good quality/value trade-off). This tripod might be fine for anyone looking to mount just a camera, but if you get into any interesting lighting scenarios, say, using a flash/umbrella mount, you're going to find that a delicate balancing act is needed to keep the cheap plastic lock holding down the tripod mount from tearing off. The first time I mounted my flash+umbrella combo, the tripod lock was visibly bending under the torque and it looked like only a matter of time before the umbrella and speedlight crashed to the floor, destroying all of the equipment. I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone using a flash, even without an umbrella, due to the force a tall object will exert on the tripod.If you intend to use this for the most basic camera situations, it might be for you, especially given the price. But if you are even a beginner looking to practice lighting scenarios, look for something much sturdier, preferably metal.",3,1,2016-7-17,1,0,0
"My first order arrived, and the tripod seemed to be decent quality, except the little knob used to make the tripod go up and down; was broken off.  There was no sign of exterior package damage, so I am assuming the knob was probably knocked off from being moved around.  As the quality of the tripod seemed good (other than the broken knob), I requested a replacement rather than a refund.When My replacement came, it was missing the camera plate.  And the head (the spot where you would set the camera) was super loose,  I was unable to tighten using the knobs.-  As this was missing the camera plate, I obviously returned it for the refund.",1,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"It's very intuitive and easy to use. I love that once you attach your camera to the the top part, you can easily detach the section in case you want to use your camera without the tripod.

It's a well-rounded good quality tripod with a universal screw mount.By the way, don't let the nub next to the screw scare you off. That nub retracts with pressure as you screw the camera down, and it's used for extra stability when the camera has a notch for it to go in.",5,1,2017-9-7,1,1,0

The center ring that keeps the tripod legs from extending out does not tighten securely enough if you carry the tripod vertically (i.e. NOT by the carrying handle).

It's a nicely priced tripod that's of quality. Upon receiving the tripod I immediately tested it out to make sure that it was 1. stable for my camera 2. stood evenly 3. not loose. There are extra knobs where you can adjust it to even be higher than it already stands! I liked that the camera can snap on easily by changing the base with a screw mechanism. I did notice that the lever knob that holds the base of the camera is a little crooked but this doesn't bother me since the lever actually holds the camera in tight.,5,1,2018-2-7,1,0,0

I have really come to appreciate Amazon Basics for offering quality merchandise that holds up to any name brand in everything but price and therein is the one area they're running under the bar and that's a good thing. This tri-pod was purchased for use with a video camera to do some YouTube videos and after looking at many options ranging in price from $60 to $100+ I found the Basics version.

We take alot of pictures and video in this family and my hands are just not steady enough to hold either our camera or video camera still enough to get a great video or picture. The tripod we had before this one you can barelt touch it and it would just fall right over. What I love about this one is it is so compact yet its extends to a nice size no matter how high or low you need it. Its nice and sturdy once it is set up and is very well made that will last for for a long time if taken very good care of. It can also be used as a stand for your stream if your video camera can be used as a webcam on the computer. I use this everytime I do my painting stream with this right on the painting and my other camera on me.

This is a very affordable tripod.  It's simple to use and the carrying case is handy.  The only thing I have an issue with is trying to record low and the tripod legs get in the shot.  That's easy to remedy by switching the camera around and such.  Though some cameras are a bit heavy for the tripod.  Still a great tripod for the price.  It is made of plastic which I guess could be an issue but it holds up well and I've had no issue.  It holds a canon rebel t3 easily and holds other cameras well.  It is very lightweight which helps when taking it different places.,5,1,2016-4-3,1,0,0
For the price it's not bad. Unbelievable review done by a guy who assembles it out of the box with nothing but his bare feet. He has no arms. I have not tried to film myself in the high wind we get at my golf course.

Price for this explains the quality. The bottom part where it extends broke so I had to drill small screws in to hold in the tripod together. Disappointed it broke but It's a plastic materialized tripod. I wish they could at least use small metal screws at the base to prevent it from happening. It is very light weight and easy to carry around. It is better than the metal tripods in the aspect of grab go and setup.,3,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0
Took this tripod out the first time and really loved it. We took a couple of family seasons that day and I was able to get great photos. It was sturdy enough that I wasn’t afraid of it tipping over and we used it in multiple locations outside. The second time I took it out I noticed that it was coming apart and that some of the pieces might have fallen off. I found them in the bottom of the bag. Should have purchased a protection plan.,3,1,2018-2-2,1,1,0
"It's not bad for the price but I wouldn't place an expensive camera on this and set it down without taping down the legs. It's flimsy but It works for light cameras, your phone, GoPro and such. Don't put a Canon or Nikon on this unless you are holding it. For the price it works but if you're looking for something in a professional setting I would get something stronger.",3,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"For an amateur photographer, this provides all the functionality I need and then some.  I use it to hold the camera steady while I photograph the moon, stars and planets.  Comes with a handy carrying sleeve so you can sling across your shoulder.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,1,0
"Sometimes you get what you pay for. I was quite pleased with the tripod at first. The head was nicer than I expected, given the price. The legs slid in and out smoothly and the locking clips calmed down reliably. Numerous bubble levels are a handy feature too. But after a couple months of very light use, one of the legs failed/broke at the point where it extends, so that leg gets unstable (it caused the tripod to fall once, but I thankfully caught it). If I fight with it a bit, I can get the clip to hold the leg in place and let me use it as if it’s not broken at all — but if I’ve got more than a thousand dollars’ worth of gear attached to it, I’m nervous about trusting it to hold up. If that leg fails and it falls again, and I don’t happen to be near enough to catch it, I’m risking a camera and lens and an audio recorder.",2,1,2018-1-11,1,1,0
"I've really wanted a tripod for a while, but being that I'm still fairly new to photography I didn't want to pay too much for my first one. I really do love this one! It's not huge and can easily be moved. It's lightweight, but also doesn't feel like the wind will knock it down. It holds my camera well, and does it's job. I wouldn't do anything too crazy with it, but it is just as advertised.My only drawback is that it doesn't come with instructions. There a few videos in this review section that did help me out figure out what's what, so it wasn't too bad.",5,1,2019-4-21,1,0,0
"After a year of use, I have taken this tripod to three countries and through all sorts of terrain. I have used this tripod underwater, in sand dunes, on the tops of mountains, to the arctic circle, and wherever else I found myself trying to get that perfect picture. After all of this, it is STILL in perfect shape and continues to be the best tripod I have ever used. Not to mention the price point, which you can’t beat for the quality!! Amazonbasics outdid themselves on this one!",5,1,2018-6-21,1,0,0
"Wow, well constructed, versatile and easy to use tripod for less than $30?  Count me in!  Unless you're a professional photographer that needs the state-of-the-art tripod with bells and whistles made of NASA rocket engines, this is the tripod for everyone else!  I bought this to use for my spotting scope and it's really stable.  The legs are made of solid aluminum with just enough thickness to make it strong, but not too heavy.  Each leg has a rotating ""foot"" so you can place it on uneven surfaces.  The head swivels quite nicely and is very easy to maneuver.  Also, there are TWO bubble levels, with one of the hidden under the mount.  Oh, and the mount comes with a quick-release detachable plate!  I keep the plate locked on my spotting scope so I can slap it on and lock it in quick.  And to top it all of, it comes with a nice handle and carrying case  Again, all for $30?!",5,1,2014-12-11,1,1,0
"I really like this tripod. I'm certain it's capable of holding my camcorder, or any sports action cameras I own, and it is quite sturdy. I don't own a dslr so I can't attest to the tripod's ability to hold that much weight but I think it's possible. I'm not a professional photographer or videographer I just am an amateur who has a bunch of crappy cameras so take from it what you will. It's the best tripod I own. I mounted a camcorder with shotgun mic, an ""L"" bracket and two 36 led camera lights and it had no issues with the weight.",5,1,2017-8-11,1,1,0
"I'm not much of a photographer, and the only reason I actually bought this was for my projector so that I could freely aim it in any direction I wanted. In that respect, the tripod performs well. It's not very heavy by any means but not overly light either, so it had no issue supporting the projector indoors for viewing on the ceiling. There's plenty of fasteners and adjustability so you can keep it steady and sturdy. There's a nice range of motion -- certainly enough for conventional shots and some unconventional ones as well, and the two bubble-levels are a nice convenience.If you're a professional photographer, I'm not sure this would be what you're looking for, but if you just need something to hold a camera or camcorder steady within reasonable conditions -- or in my case, a small projector -- for some hobbyist shooting without spending a ton of money, I think this tripod is a safe buy.",5,1,2015-8-1,1,0,0
"I had to buy a good DSLR camera this year and it took a good chunk out of my meager savings. I also needed a tripod to go with my camera. As the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."" I was really worried that I would be wasting my money on a really cheaply made tripod that would eventually force me to spend more money on a supposedly better quailty made tripod. I'm so glad that I was wrong on all accounts. This is a really nice tripod, it's not cheaply made, it's very good quality, sturdy, light weight, very good construction, and best of all the price is very afordable. When I shop Amazon I will deffinetly look for AmazonBasics first. Thank you Amazon for making quality products at a fraction of the cost.",5,1,2015-9-15,1,0,0
"I purchased this tripod to use with my digital camera. I wanted to be able to capture special events without the shakiness of being handheld.I was pleasantly surprised with how well it is made. Although it's nothing like similar products I've used 30 years ago, it has held up to the abuse my 3 year old had thrown at it. If it lasts a few years, I'd consider it money well spent.",4,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
"This is a great tripod. Yeah there are more expensive ones, but expensive isnt always better. Its compact, easy to store, and very stable.

A+++ I definitely recommend",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0

The tilt pan head won't stay up. Bought primarily to use with binoculars. Binoculars are light and way under weight rating of tripod. But every time they fall forward(binoculars when mounted) they will not stay up. The tilt head is tightened as tight as it can be. Afraid would bust if we tried to tighten any more.,3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"This is one of the best purchases and investments that I've made. I travel often, and in so many environments. This can expand up quite a bit, and it collapses easily, and light enough to hike with it. Nice bag it comes with too. It doesn't come with a phone adapter so you'll need that for anything besides a DSLR. I've used it with my Nikon DSLR and it screws in just fine to the base, and can be removed. Great product!",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
Some times when u buy cheap stuff it works great and that is the case here.Pros: super light weight easily adjustable legs and head and head sets very solid. It even has a bubble level and even better a hook to hang weights for windy days or u sturdy ground.,5,1,2015-12-14,1,0,0
"This unit is great and is perfect for medium weight dslrs with gear.  I have a T5i with light and microphone and this tripod is great .  VERY solid unless on slick flooring but just add same friction pads to the feet(which you should do anyway) and its perfect.  I like the handle, makes it easy to use this vlogging .  All of the actuation are very solid and do not drift after set.  I was impressed with the build quality compared to price.  The only addition i would like is another mount included.  I would like 2 or 3 infact as a separate purchase would be great.",5,1,2018-12-1,1,0,0
"We use the tripod to hold an iPad that films our diving practices and transmits to an Apple TV.  I needed a new tripod because the previous, more expensive one, broke.

Light weight and perfect for an FPV monitor/ground station. Not of the highest build quality but that is to be expected at this price point. All the functionality of a more expensive tripod.

"Mostly use this for slow-shutter landscape and nighttime photography. Basically need something to keep my camera angled and still. This tri-pod delivers both. I would never use this for any type of video work. The head is very plastic-ey but once you tighten it down it stays there. It's also pretty light-weight and it makes it easy for me to tote this on my hikes. The strap bag is simple yet gets the job done. I just sling it over my shoulder and get on the trails. I'd recommend this for the budget photographer who needs a decent tripod.Update: Less than a year later, 2 of the legs have fallen apart on me and the quick release plate is pretty much useless (won't stay on if camera is tilted at all). If you're just getting into photography, I'd still say this is your best option, but don't expect it to last very long. You get what you pay for.",4,1,2014-5-14,1,0,0
"Quick disconnect arrived damaged.  Compared to more expensive tripods, this one is very lightweight (meaning not very stable) and plastic breaks too easily.  It is probably fine for some uses but nothing that any professional should consider.  I was only planning on using this for some night-time binocular viewing and it is not capable of holding the binoculars.  It could be the fact that it arrived damaged but even trying to work around that issue it doesn't seem capable.  I'm instead using my wife's photography tripods as they are much better quality and can handle it like a champ.",2,1,2018-3-13,1,0,1
"This tripod is easily worth the price point. If you're looking for a tripod to support a point and shoot or lighting, this tripod is for you! However, due to the build quality and the head being plastic, it doesn't support heavier DSLRs very well. The panning motion is very jittery due to the friction of the plastic.I gave the tripod a 4 star because it is still useful for mounting lights and lightweight (point and shoot, go-pro) stationary mounting where you don't need to pan the shot.",4,1,2018-1-25,1,0,0
Only by this if you really use a tripod and don't beat your equipment up at all. I bought this thing with the warranty couldn't find some of the parts to send back with it never exchanged it. Buy a manfrotto it's worth the money.,2,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0

"Needed a couple of extra tripods for a multi-camera music video shoot. Nothing fancy - didn't want to spend a lot of money, just something to hold a camera for an afternoon. I had zero expectations. Imagine my surprise when I set them up, saw how positive & smooth all the functions are and that not only do they look like they might last awhile - but they might be a great, lightweight travel tripod for trips & location shoots. Very light - so you might need to hang a weight from the ballast hook to keep it steady, but I couldn't be happier with the item and the price.",5,1,2016-3-15,1,1,0
"This is a great lightweight tripod that has all the features and adjustments that you might think of. My only thought that because it is lightweight, a heavier camera like a DSLR would be less stable. That is of course what the hook on the bottom is for though. As for me, I just use a point and shoot and this works just fine.Update: As of August 29, 2015 one of the leg clasps broke off completely. The tripod is now inoperable and unable to be repaired. So it lasted about 4 months. Should've bought a more quality tripod.",2,1,2015-5-27,1,1,0
"You get what you pay for, and I'm pleasantly surprised by this tripod. It does require a tender touch so if your rough with equipment it won't last long, but take care and it works great.

"I bought this tripod for my new Nikon D3300. Works just as expected and seems to be a very reliable tripod. It's lightweight and is at my eye-level when fully extended. The only problem I had was that I unscrewed the main handle too much so it came off and the bolt in the front which held it in place fell out. It was easy to fix though - you just put the bolt back where it was (in the front) and screw the handle back on. I recommend this to anyone looking for a decent, affordable tripod.",5,1,2017-2-15,1,0,0
"It is simple, handy, easy to carry. This is my first tripod and I have been able to use it with a DSRL and a point and shoot. I also have to say it is compact (for carrying)  but extends nicely. I do like the built-in level, the carrying case the quick disconnect feature if you want to quickly take the camera out of the tripod base. In times feels a bit rough on the movements which might be an issue is your are filming, but so far I have found a work around and learned to deal with it.I would highly recommend, of you are not a professional,  this as it is good quality and excellent price.",4,1,2016-9-14,1,0,0
"The tripod from AmazonBasics is a steal for its price. I purchased this to use with my Nikon D5600. The tripod uses quality materials. The fit and finish are good(solid manufacturing tolerances). Additionally it has most of the bells and whistles of mush more expensive tripods: C-clamp leg locks instead of spin locks which wear out easier, double extending legs, level balancing bubbles, a quick release camera mounting base, and a decent carrying bag.

The way it's constructed prevents me from being able to fix it so now I have this dead-weight, busted tripod and Amazon has 24 of my dollars. Waste of money.EDIT: I managed to put it back but it's a bit shaky. I'm not sure if that's the tripod itself or my inadequate fix but for my purposes it's not a big deal. Having to fix it on the hour I got it still irritates me, though, and I will begrudgingly be using it with that memory. So far everything else seems to work fine.",3,1,2016-7-1,1,0,0

This broke after having for less than a year. I removed the arm that rotates the camera to store it and when I went to put it back together it wouldn't screw back in no matter how hard I tried. So it became useless since it would stay up right with a camera on it. Bought a cheap one to replace it and that works better than this one did!,2,1,2018-1-23,1,1,0

Bear in mind, its $23 and not comparable to high end fluid tripods but for $23, i dont care if it lasts a year on the job site.

"Works for what it is designed to do. Easy clamps to adjust legs, breaks down quick, has a handle and a bag. Could use some extra weight perhaps. Only complaint is the adjustments for the camera head are a little less than smooth. If you are using just for still shots, probably wouldn't be an issue, but a little zoom and recording video, every minute adjustment brings on jitter and shake time. For the few shots I've taken, this has worked great, but the panning & tilt during (albiet zoomed) video is not ideal.",4,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
Cheaply constructed tripod.  The plastic head is difficult to adjust and doesn’t accommodate a metal binocular mount.  The plastic is very flexible and doesn’t keep your device stabile.

This item comes with an up-down rotator, double-extendable legs, a crank to increase the height of the camera itself, and even levels to test if it's straight. In addition, it has a little handle to hold it, so it's easy to carry around. The only thing it does NOT (at least not that I've found yet) is the ability to horizontally rotate the top piece. In other words, to turn it left or right, you need to turn the whole stand (Do correct me if I'm wrong about this, but I haven't had luck on this end).Still, though, highly recommended, and for the price, you really can't beat it.",5,1,2015-12-3,1,0,0

"I'm new to photography and wanted an inexpensive tripod so that I could take some steady shots.  I read a lot about what I'd need in a tripod, but honestly, I was driven by price.  I didn't want to invest a fortune in something that I wasn't even sure if I'd use all that often!  I've already gotten my money out of this little guy.  The built-in levels make it so easy to be sure everything's set up correctly, and it's super light -- very easy to tote around, especially in its carrying bag.  My only gripe is that as a first-time user, I literally had no idea what I was doing or how to attach the camera to the tripod.  A quick instruction sheet would've been helpful, but it's so easy to use, anybody can figure it out.",5,1,2015-12-6,1,3,0
"I've yet to mount my camera on this but I know my review won't change.  I had a more expensive one before, wind while I was setting up a shot took care of that one and I needed new, I like being in the family pictures I'm taking so this is going to be great.  It's well built, feels solid and has all the things I need to get my pictures without spending a fortune!",5,1,2018-8-31,1,0,0
"Overall good value for basic photography, but terrible for zoom-lens; light cameras would likely be fine.I've got a Nikon P900 and I purchased this tripod to be able to use the super telephoto lens on that camera and it just isn't a good fit. No matter how tight I make everything, the camera still moves around quite a bit making it difficult at best to use for telephoto photography. It's still useful for my older cannon DSLR which is much lighter but I wish I would have dropped a bit more money to get something that was a bit better.",3,1,2017-2-25,1,0,0

"I never write reviews but this deserves one. You will NEVER find a better tripod for this price than this tripod. I have a very heavy DSLR (70D + battery grip + telephoto lens) and my previous cheap tripods couldn't support the weight. The head of the tripod would just tilt down under the weight of the camera and the legs weren't very sturdy. This tripod is rock solid sturdy. The head is rugged and sturdy.

I bought this since March 2016 so I have been using it for one year and more now. I purchased it after my first tripod broke which was a cheap one nothing fancy and I can't remember the brand even. I then saw this which was in the perfect price range to me but i didn't think that it will be a very high quality when i purchased it. this stuff is great and it can handle my canon700D and i used it a lot for one year and it never failed me. it's not heavy and it has a handle where you can hold it when moving other places. i still use it to this moment.,5,1,2017-6-30,1,3,1

"This is a good tripod for the price as long as you don't need additional features. It feels sturdy for such a lightweight tripod.

A good cheap tripod for stationary shots. Terrible for video shots where you expect to pan a moving subject and/or zoom in for close-ups. (ie: school plays; concerts; sporting events). I purchased the better tripod which allows smooth movement with a 360 degree ball head and now get perfect recordings. Yes it cost more but the results are worth the expense.,2,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0
"Worth it if you don't have a lot of money to spend. Yes it *feels* a little cheap, with its plastic components but with care it will be just fine until you can upgrade. The levels are a nice touch. The one under the camera plate is a bit hard to see without direct light or in portrait position. But it was worth the buy for me for the money.",5,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
"This is a good solid tripod.  It is a great step up from my old cheap Quantaray.  I really like that it has a hook on the center column for additional weight.  It's light and acceptable for taking on outdoor activities, but the carrying strap can get a bit abrasive.  This is the price we pay for a solid $20 tripod.My main intent of this tripod was for off-camera flash.  With the combined weight of umbrella holder, flash, and umbrella though, you have to tighten the assembly very tightly to the quick release plate or the whole assembly will rotate on the rubber QR plate surface, possibly upsetting the balance of the whole unit.  (It will stay in place if you tighten it enough) I could see the rubber on the QR plate degrading after seeing too much high pressure friction, but I've only used it in this capacity once so far.  I have rated it 4 stars because I'm very pleased otherwise, and it probably wasn't fully intended to be used as an umbrella flash holder (since there are light stands dedicated to such things).",4,1,2012-10-13,1,0,0
"Does the job.  Carries my Nikon D610 with a 80-200 f2.8. without any problems.  Not great for video as pan is rough.  A great value.  Docking a star cos the head cant be changed.

"If you're looking for the best tripod on the market, this isn't it.  However, my original inexpensive tripod quick change plate finally gave out, and the price on this one was right.  The legs lock, the quick plate attaches, and the head swivels and tips.  This tripod lives in my studio - I don't take it camping or out in rough weather.  It sees fairly light duty.  On occassion, I might need to fold it up and take it across town, and from what I can see I doubt I'll have problems with that.  If you're looking for an inexpensive 'pod to hold up your camera and a not-too-heavy lens, this will do you fine.",4,1,2015-9-6,1,1,0

"I received this over Christmas of 2015 after using it. Few times I feel OK to write my review.This is a very simple to use tripod with a decent carrying case to go along. I was hoping for more height but I am still very new to photography and may end realizing I won't need anymore later on. I also do not have a remote yet, so I am using it with a timer when I am taking a shot of myself and others. When I am taking and scapes or wild life portraits I do find it very easy to set up and use without worrying about a steady hand. I can adjust it as needed with out difficulty and it is very secure once locked. I think this is a great tripod for any newbie like me!",4,1,2016-5-17,1,0,0
I bought this and it is exactly what I thought and wanted. You unlock the segments of the leg and extend them and lock them. You  turn the crank to extend the mount off the base.

"Sturdy and not too heavy. I use it when I don't want the camera to shake (during videos or portrait shots). However, it does not move around smoothly, so if you want to film movies that requires the camera to move, this is not for you. It will be choppy and hard to maneuver. But if you just want a cheap solution to hold you camera still, this is perfect. It is not expensive, and it can get tall enough for standing shots as well as low enough for sitting shots. Easy to use and sturdy.UPDATE:",4,1,2015-5-12,1,0,0
"Before purchasing this Tripod I read all the reviews that highly touted this item. Some said that it was an incredible value. Others mentioned the level, and vernier crank for final elevation adjustment. Some thought the portability was nice.

"I use a Canon DSLR now, but when I purchased this, I was shooting videos in an iPhone, so it made sense.  I can recommend this product for indoor use.  When I use it for outdoors, its very light which its pretty nice, but I need to be very careful if I leave the camera unattended to take a picture of myself with the family or make a video of some sort.  I always look for wind or people walking around, because it is extremely light.  It has a hook underneath to put some weight.  It does the job, but not for professional use, the price speaks volumes.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"I know this isn't incredibly cheap but when you open it you understand what you're paying for. This feels solid yet light with a bunch of ways to adjust angles from any direction.

It even came with an over the shoulder carry case on top of already having a metal handle on the side. Amazing product and price! 10/10",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"The only negative side to this tripod is you can visually notice that it is made out of cheaper materials than the traditional high grade expensive tripods.

Height is perfect too, as I can fully extend all legs, and crank the center up and get the camera right at eye level which is perfect. The head of the tripod has good adjustments, and also seems pretty sturdy.I think the key is not cranking down the adjustments on the tripod. I saw some reviews that mentioned that screws and adjusters have stripped out, and broken. Just snug everything up to the point where it doesn't move around. You don't have to tighten everything until it's at the point of snapping.",5,1,2016-11-17,1,0,0
"I'll start by saying that It's hard to complain about a tripod at this price point. All in all, this is a tripod that will hold your camera steady. If you have that need only once in a while, this guy will do the trick. It's good for someone who is just buying a kit to have on hand in case something unexpectedly comes up.That said, this tripod is not sufficient for everyday photography use. The head is stiff and hard to maneuver. The legs feel rigid, but not strong. Small bumps and movements make the whole fixture shake. While the tripod does include some conveniences, the construction is weak; mine started coming apart after a couple of weeks tops. The handle is now loose, as are the legs when folded. I already feel like it needs to be replaced, since I don't want to risk a leg breaking off while I'm trying to open it up to take photos.",3,1,2014-4-24,1,2,0
I like this very lightweight tripod. I use it to hold my spotting scope. It is very adjustable and I can use it on a bench or freestanding on the ground.

mine arrived with out the adapter plate required to put a camera or anything on it.  just an empty qr plate pocket.

For the price and amazon generic brand. You can’t really expect more. The tripod is lightweight. However when you try to tilt the camera it is not very fluid. I do live broadcast with it.

If you're looking for a tripod that's going to last do not buy this... Although, if you want a cheap disposable one then it's okay. Because it's so light weight you have to be careful with a heavier camera so that the tripod doesn't tip. I was using a Canon 5D mark 3 with a 70-200mm lens and the tripod was more tentative with that much weight. Although, I still got some cool shots with it before it broke. :)",2,1,2017-6-6,1,8,0

Also  NO MANUAL comes with this tripod nor could I find one online anywhere. I called customer service for a manual and was told there wasn't one. They kindly offered to replace the tripod with the return of the first one. I took the offer but I'll be very hesitant to buy another Amazon Basics product.",2,1,2018-5-17,1,0,0
"This unit has a good size interlocking pad which collaborates well with the size and stability of the tripod. With a $1500 Electronic Radon Monitor mounted to its top, I need a stable and secure support system below. This tripod rises to the task! I liked it so much , I changed out all my previous tripod setups to this one and actually bought two extras for ""just -in- case"".",5,1,2019-5-21,1,0,1
I thought this tripod had a universal mounting system.  I have a Cannon T3 Rebel and I could not mount my camera on this tripod.  Took with me on a hiking trip and had big hopes for it.  Ended up taking all the pics myself and don't have a single picture of the complete group of people on the trip (group pictures was the goal).  Really disappointed.  This was supposed to work!  Even the picture looked like it was a T3 mounted on it.  Completely useless to me...,2,1,2016-9-10,1,1,0
"So far so good! I really like that the top middle part extends even after all of the legs are fully extended. I haven’t used it a ton, but I like it! I also think it’s great that there is a hook at the bottom of the base! Comes in handy to hang your bag while getting the shot :)",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"This is the first ""AmazonBasics"" product I have purchased. It is a very fine tripod and I'm pleased with the 60-inch height. I have used it to mount a camera and a 60 power Leopold spotting scope that is one heavy dude. This tripod can handle the weight. I like the carrying bag too. It is a quality piece of equipment regardless of price, and the price is right!",5,1,2017-5-15,1,1,0
"This tripod is very good for the price. You can adjust the height, tilt,  and rotate .  Adjusting is very simple and easy you can do it without instructions. It can go as high as 6 feet with additional height  adjustment.  I am a beginner photographer so I don’t need expensive high and tripod this perfectly suits my needs .",5,1,2018-12-30,1,1,0
"I have to admit, I read the description and saw the price and thought this can't possibly be as good as it says it is for the price.  If this is not one of the best deals at Amazon, I don't know what is.  This is an amazing tripod that adjusts in so many numerous ways that I have yet to find an angle or position this tripod can't accomplish.  Its is lightweight so if you need to carry it any distance, you will love it.  I have used many much more expensive tripods that I ended up hating because it was too heavy and did not have enough angle options to meet my requirements.  This one does it all.",5,1,2016-8-31,1,0,0
"Before I bought this tripod I went to bestbuy and bought a 65 dollar tripod that was very similar, I got home and pulled it out of the box and one of the legs was broken so I returned it. Then I checked on amazon for tripods and saw this one that was less than half the price so I went for it. I'm so glad my first tripod broke because this tripod is super nice and on par or better than the 65 dollar one. There's nothing fancy about it but for taking still photos and video that doesn't need smooth panning this tripod is perfect. It's also very light and comes with a great carrying case. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is in the market for a tripod.",5,1,2016-6-14,1,0,0
"Alright, this one is really confusing to me. For nearly 5 stars and 2k reviews, I absolutely expected more. I will note that the camera I use is an old (2007ish) Canon Rebel XT. This is not an abnormally large or heavy camera.I bought this to photograph my products for my small business. I need the tripod to do very simple things.",1,1,2015-10-30,1,1,0
"This is a great little tripod, nice size, lightweight,  lots of versatility. This is great if you don't have to pan left or right. You really can't use this for video, the panning is stiff and you have to hold onto the tripod aggressively when you pan. If you don't need to pan left or right, it's a great tripod, unfortunately I needed it to shoot video and it's pretty hard to use in this respect.",2,1,2018-11-18,1,0,0
"I bought this for my 14 year old daughter, hoping it would be a decent tripod for her. It only lasted about 3 months, and one of the legs fell off for no reason at all. It was very, very light weight, and very sensitive to any vibrations. This is a waste of money, good thing it was super cheap, but I will not be buying this product again",2,1,2018-1-9,1,1,0
"This tripod is amazing and you can't beat the price!!!  It's perfect for my YouTube channel and so lightweight, I have no problems moving it up and down the stairs to film.  Setup was super easy, and it's much more durable than I expected it to be.  There are many other more expensive tripods out there, but this one gets the job done, easily, and for much less money.  If you're just starting out and experimenting with tripod use, I would highly recommend this tripod!!",5,1,2016-7-3,1,0,0
"Wow, this tripod is great. Cheap and it functions in the way I need it to.OK so I'm not a professional photographer so don't have particularly sophisticated needs, but I wanted a tripod that was functional and lightweight and this met that criteria. I have had no issues with stability or strength and it is simple to use. It has a good height range that works for me (5""6) or my 6""3 husband. The legs are easy to adjust and the feet can be manipulated to help level it even further. My Nikon D3300 feels secure when on the tripod.",5,1,2016-6-29,1,0,0
"I absolutely love this tripod. It smoothly changes height and stays in place very nicely as well. I like that I can simply slide the camera out and click it back in place without having to wear down the screw threads on the bottom of my camcorder. This tripod also make it so easy to angle the camera and lock it into position again. It's nice that this comes with a bag, but really it's just as comfortable to carry around with the handle. The only thing I wish this had was a way to connect a ring light as well without having to use a separate light stand.",5,1,2016-10-8,1,0,0
"The package arrived torn, dented, and ripped apart. The tripod itself had a dented leg that prevented extension so for all purposes it was unusable. Amazon is sending a replacement free of charge and the return process is much more painless than from a third party seller so at least that's nice.The tripod itself is a bit bigger than I expected, definitely less compact than others I've used but for the price it seems functional. Planning to update review once a workable item actually arrives.",1,1,2018-2-26,1,1,0
I was blown away by this tripod when it arrived. It is so easy to adjust the leg height. The camera footplate is so easy to use. Almost everything on this tripod is adjustable for whatever function you could be using it for. I am so pleased with the high quality of this product. It is a great value. The only thing I can’t comment on is the longevity of the product but it just seems like it has a quality build to it that will last.,5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"For us baby boomers who remember when a small professional tripod could cost several hundred dollars, I can say this simple tripod is totally fantastic and worth twice the price.  I have a similar 60"" Sony tripod which cost $60 and it pales in comparison to this AmazonBasics tripod.  I can't believe I got it for under $25.  I hope you can too.  It's a winner!",5,1,2018-7-28,1,0,0
"For the most part the tripod worked just OK.  The horizontal axis was very tight (not fluid) in its movement, which was very disappointing because I was using it to do bird watching with your (Amazon's) 80 mm scope (GoSky)., that made the image really bounce.  It was so bad that the tripod would tip to one side.  I was going to return it, but decided it would be too much trouble, so I threw it in the bottom of my closet thinking I'll use it with my 35mm DSLR someday to take stills.  I went to Wal-Mart and got one of much better quality for half the price.  The GoSky scope was very nice though.",1,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0
"I am a newbie photographer but this tripod is so easy to set up, that it deserves the 5 stars.  I don't know how long it will last but that's ok it does the job and the price is unbeatable.  In the past I bought one from Targus at Target for 40.00 and it was so complicated that I never could set it up it hardly got used yet it broke.  So far I'm happy with this purchase. Even it it breaks in the future I'm just glad it's not complicated to set up and I have been using it without any issues.",5,1,2015-8-10,1,2,0
"Lightweight and easy to adjust - but not very stable (telescoping head still a bit wobbly, even when the locking nut is cranked down). If you're placing a lightweight camera on the head and not touching it much, you'll be fine. I'm using a DSLR for video and not manipulating it during shooting, so I'm getting away with it. But if I were looking for a truly stable platform to shoot from, this would be pretty useless.",2,1,2016-11-25,1,1,0
"Know upfront that this is not a heavy duty tripod. With that said, I am satisfied with it for my purposes since I only use it occasionally at home for videos. If I needed a tripod for daily use at different locations, I would go with a more durable model. It is packed with the same features as more expensive models, just made a little cheaper.",5,1,2018-10-29,1,0,0
"I got this tripod to use it with a Nikon D5100 with either the 18-55 kit lens or a Nikkor 35mm DX f/1.8. The only additional weight I expected to add was a small metal focusing rail.So far the tripod has performed pretty well. I use it a lot for macro and it is steady enough that vibrations are not an issue. When fully extended it is very stable, I am never worried about the safety of my gear. There are two locking rings, one with a simple tread is used to lock the post, and a some kind of bayonet ring locks the legs open. I would love this even more of both locking rings had used this bayonet mechanism.",5,1,2012-5-11,1,0,0
"I use this tripod for general photography both with camera and smartphone (using a smartphone adapter), and to stably position an SPL meter for receiver calibration.It's stable, well made, has all the expected adjustment points and even includes a carrying bag.",5,1,2019-2-6,1,0,0
"I'm not an expert on tripods, but this is perfectly solid and feels very quality overall. I could imagine some of the operations being smoother in a higher end tripod, in particular the twist action on the handle (controlling up and down pitch angle) and the left-right yaw swivel. For example I'm not sure I could do a smooth left-right pan if I were shooting video. Also there's no way to lock the yaw angle that I can see, but it's not loose so you don't need to worry about your camera swiveling inadvertently.",5,1,2017-2-15,1,0,0
I was surprised how nice this tripod was for the money. I'm not a professional photographer or anything like that. Everything on the tripode worked smoothly and it feels strong and sturdy. I'm a tall person and even this tripod extended tall enough for me to use as well. It's rare that something surpasses my expectations but this tripod for the money did. Would buy again.,5,1,2019-1-11,1,0,0
I’m a real estate photographer. Extremely lightweight. Easy to lift and maneuver. The lock broke on the first one I bought after about 8 months. I use it multiple times a week so it held up fairly well. I bought another one and it is still going strong after several months.,4,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I was a little worried about this after reading some of the reviews but I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a full size tripod.  Glad I gave it a go.  So far, so good.

I'm thinking about purchasing a second one for my spotting scope.",5,1,2017-7-29,1,1,0
"I was pretty excited when I got this. I don't use a tripod often, but it's nice to have one handy when I need it.

It worked very well for me when I used it and is a great buy for the price.",3,1,2014-4-5,1,0,0
"I found this more than adequate to my needs.  When using 500 mm (2x teleconverter for 1000mm) lens like Viviatar, Bower, Opteka, a tripod becomes a necessity.

"I LOVE THIS, I just wish they made a smaller version that was just as nice so it would be easier to carry on hikes.I've been using this for awhile and it holds up really well. The movable feet make it easy to set the tripod up outdoors. It has multiple levels that let you get the perfect shot! For such a low price this Tripod really works well. I was able to get multiple shots with it I wouldn't have been able to get without it!

I especially like how the faceplate can flip right off if you need to handhold your camera and don't want to start unscrewing it. I have purchased many AmazonBasics products and I have never had a problem with any of them ... they are always well made and are offered at a very competitive price as compared to similar brand name items.

"I have never owned a tripod before this one, so I can't compare it to another, however this one has worked great for me so far. I liked the fact that it was portable, I needed it to fit inside my suitcase when I traveled to Jamaica for a wedding and vacation, and it fit perfectly. It is very light, and easy to set up. We used it for our large Canon EOS camera with both the standard and a larger lens, worked great. We also used it for a Kodak hand held video camera, also worked great. It is very easy to move when it is all set up, but felt very sturdy when in use, even on a sandy beach. Once I figured out how to maneuver it how I wanted, it was easy peasy. I know I will get a lot of use out of this tripod.",5,1,2015-4-13,1,0,0

I wouldn't spend a ton of money for something like this on this product you get more than what you pay for is a good investment.

Worry no more, this tripod will literally save you and your back thousands of dollars from all the doctor visits, acupuncture appointments, and physical therapists after years and years of stacking books just to reach the desired height for your camera.

"I am an amateur photographer, and one with not loads of money. This tripod gave me a cheap ""professional-level"" tripod that I was seeking - it provides enough support for my camera with different lenses - including a heavy 100-200mm Canon FD lens from the 1970s (older zoom lenses can be heavy!). It is stable, and the few times I have used it have made me very happy. Locking all the mechanisms that you want, and the camera stays stable. lock a few, keep the swivel available for quick panning - that works great too! pumping the tripod beyond the legs height - still stable as well! For the price, this is a great tripod. I am sure professional photographers might find issues with it - but for my needs, it beyond exceeds my expectations.",5,1,2014-1-3,1,1,0

I wanted to get another tripod for my camera so that I could also take vertical pictures.  When I found this one I decided to purchase it and for the last half month I have been using it and love it!  Perfect for what I need as a non-proffesional photographer and very helpful that it is so light-weight given that I am a nature photographer going on long hikes with it.Would give it 5 stars but only downside is that I can't fully lock it so that it won't move at all, but that is a minor problem that I can totally put up with.",4,1,2012-7-17,1,1,0

My one complaint, which is why I knocked off a star, is when I took this out of the box for the first time, the end of the handle that raises and lowers the part that mounts to the camera was broken.  Not a major issue, since it still works fine, which is why I didn't bother sending it back to get a new one.  The tripod seems sturdy, and is very easy to put up and down.

If you have a larger professional camera, not sure if this tripod will be strong enough for that kind of camera. The quality of the product is OK, the legs seem to be hollow...so just beware of that. You can't put sandbags at the bottom.For the price I'm happy. If I find that I need a stronger tripod I will pay the extra cash.

However my camera which should be way more delicate was totally fine. It was past the return date so I bought this one. As the size is bigger this one is stronger. However, today when I took it from the shelf it fell down again, because the strap was off the bag. I only used it for twice and most of the time it stayed in a storage and I just can't understand the quality can be so weak.

I have found the tilt and swivel functions to be more than adequate for my needs, but I have not been using it to shoot any moving footage.

My husband is a videographer and he has a $100 tripod, and this one has pretty much the same look and features. The only thing different was that this is lightweight. Which, for me, is prefect. It has a little hook underneath the camera mount where I assume you can hang the carry bag it comes with. Or my husband suggested to hang a weight to make it a little more sturdy when panning. There's two levels built in, as well which is something my husband doesn't have on his. Nah nah nah nah! This Item is 100% worth the price! Thanks Amazon.",5,1,2017-1-12,1,0,0
"I bought this several months ago, thinking that I did not have to worry about it. That I can just keep it in the closet and pull it out when I needed, that moment came a few days ago and it was terrible! One of the knobs used to straighten the camera was loose, I had to stuff papers under the camera for proper placement and the screw that sticks out to mount the camera was so short my camcorder barely clung onto it. Terrible, terrible. Lesson learned that I should test and try out products upon delivery.",1,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"I got my tripod today and I have to be honest, I didn't know what to expect - but I am so very pleasantly surprised!  It's light - it has a great carrying case  - and the tripod itself as a handle.  I had no difficulties ""opening"" it up to full length and the same with closing it back up.  It has two bubble levels, a hook to hang your bag or purse (if you carry one); you can seriously position it any which way.  I'm super excited I got this!  Definitely recommend!",5,1,2018-8-25,1,0,0
"This is my first tripod.  I'm loving it.  It's exactly what I didn't know I wanted.  I purchased this on a whim because I've always heard they were great to have but never felt I needed one.  Finally, I agreed it would be nice but was just purchasing a ""cheap"" product and wow I'm so glad I did.  I don't know how I managed to take pictures without it.",5,1,2017-9-3,1,1,0
"This product is ok , yes it is cheap and yes I have seen worse . So I am using this as a tripod for my smart phone and for this it is stable. But if you are looking for a stable base for a heavy camera I doubt that the head has the long term stability to hold it in place , especially when it is a crocked angle. Further if you are shooting action and moving targets the head is simple jerky and it is impossible to follow a target with a continues fluid like smooth moving action. I think it is a decent product but I also know that I have bought better quality in the past. It does what I wanted it for ...",3,1,2017-6-26,1,0,0
"This is a very easy to use and a great working product. I use this for taking concert videos, still pictures and a variety  of other needs. Find this to be extremely easy to setup, a very nice carry case to carry it around to all my places. Use it, tug it to the bag, drop it on your shoulder and walk around to the next stop. The steel is very sturdily made and so far I have had no issues with the extending legs or any of nobs and widgets. It is also very light compared to my previous tripods that did not last long and were much heavier.",5,1,2016-12-24,1,1,0
"I needed a tripod for my up coming vacation. I wanted a compact and durable tripod for my Sony camera. This was promising because it is an Amazon high rating product. Which I usually trust when I buy things on Amazon. But turns out it is not anything close to being compact. Durable, yes since it is huge I would expect it to be strong. But it is still too long and bulky to travel with. The ""lock"" at every notch is very flimsy and I have a feeling it will not be good for log. I guess you get what you pay for!",2,1,2018-4-19,1,0,1
"Awesome product,  starts out very compact and even comes in its own carrying bag.  Sets up in seconds and adjusts up to six feet tall. Has two levels to be able to get the camera level and stabilized quickly.  Weighs next to nothing so carrying this tripod around is effortless.  Has made making videos so much easier as I can just set it up and hook up my camera in minutes. I have already recommended this to dozens of friends and family who thought my most recent pictures and videos were more professional looking.  The cost is only one of the best aspects of this product. You will not break the bank trying to find a reliable tripod any longer.",5,1,2016-8-22,1,0,0
"This tripod is the best for its price. I have been using this tripod for the past 2 years. There are some limitations using this tripod under certain conditions, but it would be unfair to blame this tripod for the price. This is a very light but stable tripod. I hang my camera bag under this tripod for maximum stability. I use a D750 with a Nikon 16-35 lens which holds good under any angle. I am maimly into landscape and this tripod has been really helpful under most of the conditions. Due to its light weight, you can carry it always. People tend to avoid tripods which are expensive because they have to carry the weight. The only drawback is the minimum height, where you really want to get close to the ground for a foreground. Same for the height. The carry bags strap isnt big that you can carry it cross your shoulder(I find that safer). For these limitations I have given it a 4 star and not a 5 but for its price definitely a 5.",4,1,2016-10-1,1,0,0
"Hobby photographer here, I bought this not thinking much of it since its priced cheaper then most I've seen. It actually works way better than I could have anticipated. So glad I bought this.

Breaks down quick and the carry bag is convenient. Great buy.",5,1,2016-8-31,1,1,0

This inexpensive tripod is perfect for any beginner. It's adjustable and easy to carry around (and it comes with its very own bag). Extra weight can be added on to make it more stable by hanging it on the hook at the bottom. The only issue is that it doesn't pan as smoothly as I would have expected it too.,4,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
This Tripod would be ok for cameras and photo shoots with stationary shots. For Spotting scopes and video cameras it is awful.It would be difficult to film on this. The panning horizontally is about as smooth as the rumble strips on the side of the road. Movement is also very limited in some directions.,1,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"It’s pretty sturdy, but the mechanics of it are awkward and overall it’s a bit cumbersome. I have purchased a few other tripods on Amazon and while this one feels like it may last longer than 9-12 mos, it doesn’t thrill me.",3,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
We love this! It’s a great price. It isn’t the most durable thing out there but we don’t use it a ton. We love the adjustments and everything. We bought a second one after testing it out. We will buy again if the need arises. It’s perfect for us.,4,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"Loved this tripod at first, but went to use it this weekend & one of the leg locks apparently broke and slid down.  Cannot get it to slide up and stay locked in place.  Kind of like having a broken knee.  Really annoyed.  Only use it a couple of times a year",2,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
Would not recommend this for a DSLR camera with a telephoto lens. The legs of this tripod are very skinny and don't feel sturdy at all. This would be fine for a point and shoot camera but I wouldn't risk anything heavier.,2,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
I am not a professional videographer or photographer so this mid-range/priced tripod is perfect for me. It is light weight and holds my small camcorder stable. The price was reasonable. I am happy with this purchase.,4,1,2019-3-5,1,1,0
"At a much lower price than others, it's easy to think that it won't be high quality or will have limited functionality. I can't believe I didn't get this sooner. I've seen others in person for much more and they don't seem too different from this one. It's solid, lightweight and does what it says it does. Great job again amazon.",5,1,2019-2-24,1,0,0
"I had read earlier reviews about how this thing might be Chinesium, and well, while it is, it's not flimsy and it's quite accomodating, which is a relief. While the movement of the handles and the direct aim leave a little bit to be desired you can tweak those by adjusting the tightness knobs a bit and moving it around to get a feel for where you want smoother handling. Levels are worthwhile and having not had a legitimate tripod before, this can be a decent solution.",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
"I love this!! It's sturdy and great. I used it to photograph stars, and also for video of my training. I have a very expensive camera and feel safe with it.I can level it up to be straight on unsturdy ground, and it goes high enough to go over the electric fence as pictured.",5,1,2016-11-16,1,2,1
"I had higher hopes for this tripod since it had such a high rating. I was going to use it for my 62x superzoom dslr for zoom shots. Unfortunately, the plastic mechanisms it uses are not nearly smooth enough to be able to zoom in and then tighten down without moving the subject out of frame. It works well as a typical tripod.",3,1,2018-8-23,1,0,0
This was an awesome buy. I only have stability in 1 arm. This was so lightweight to carry on one side along with all my camera equipment. The hook in the center was perfect to hang my camera bag from & it was really stable. LOVE this tripod.,5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
"This was a surprisingly nice tripod. It's very tough, lightweight, and maneuverable. The price is a bargain. The only thing I didn't like was the adjustment arm. It juts out a little too far from the central axis. It's easy to bump into more than it should be.",4,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0

"I needed a lightweight tripod to use with a small video camera, and this fits the bill perfectly. The legs can be locked in a small footprint configuration, so I can use it in a row of an auditorium.  This tripod is actually more sturdy than a more expensive tripod I purchased many years ago--everything locks down tightly so there is no shake or slop in the mechanism. While I don't know if I would put my heavy DSLR on it, for a lighter weight camera or digital recorder (like the TASCAM DR-40), this will work just fine.",5,1,2016-12-13,1,0,0

Used this for the first time the other day to take a family photo. It is incredibly simple to set up and put your camera on. Its sturdy and has a little level to make sure the camera is straight. I'm not a photographer by any means but this thing is super easy to use. Love this thing.,5,1,2016-10-9,1,2,0
"This tripod is a nice, inexpensive, lightweight item. If you have any intent of using it to tilt and pan a video camera, you will probably want something sturdier and with a much quieter head. I had to use some dry lubricant on the pivot points and even with that and with all of the release knobs loosened, it still would catch and grind a bit when I moved the head. The grinding was loud enough to be picked up by the camera's microphones.Still, OK for the price.",4,1,2016-12-21,1,0,0
Stable 'pod. It doesn't come with a holder for smartphones though (if you're into phone photography like me). It comes with a travel bag for storage. There's this attachment that balances out the tripod itself if one of the legs isn't aligned with one another.,5,1,2019-1-30,1,1,0

"Picked this up on a prime days special and very happy I decided to move forward on it.  For the price the quality of the tripod is excellent.  I will mainly use this with cell phone, GoPro, and DSLR with smaller lenses so it should work out perfectly.

"I am a hobby digital photographer, dragged kicking and screaming from film.  My old 3 leg tripod was expensive in it's day but was a good 20 yrs old.  This new inexpensive tripod is WONDERFUL.  The snap-off plate that locks the camera on the top of the tripod, the two bubble levels on the tripod, the adjustments for forward and backward rotation is on the exntension handle at the rear of the camera (wrist-rotates to lock or adjust), and the easier method of flips to extend the legs.The tripod also has a convenient plastic grip to carry it when out of the bag, the black bag that holds the tripod for travel, etc.",5,1,2012-6-28,1,0,0

"If you need a tripod for cheap, this is it. It works fairly well for basic functions. I've used it for time lapses with any issues. It comes with a carrying case that makes storing it away very nice without the worry of scratching anything. I will note that the quality is not the best. At full height it is quite wobbly if you don't tighten everything down very well. Another issue I have found is that it does not open very wide. It can seem unstable sometimes due to this, especially the more extended it is.",4,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0

"It is what it's advertised to be: a basic tripod. It actually functions fairly smoothly. The only complaint I have is that the pan rotation is not particularly smooth, even with the locking nut completely disengaged. The tilt friction control is much smoother.The one complaint I have is related to a cost-neutral design decision. The bubble level is integrated into the tripod at the top of the legs and below the pan swivel connection, rather than somewhere in the body above the tilt control. As a result, you can level the pan rotation relative to the ground, but there is no way to accurately zero the tilt elevation. The similar",4,1,2015-11-27,1,0,0

There is a hook to add a weight to keep the stand from blowing in the wind, but if you use it in a high traffic area, I suggest hanging something bright off it, to let people see where the legs are.

Tripod is too light for semi-serious DSLR user and I don't feel comfortable with my additional audio and multi battery attachments (well under 5lbs). Too much play. I tightened but there is too much play. Note to Amazon / Supplier: I think this level of tripod is too light for the multi angle pivot included in the head unit... That added to ""play"".

It worked fairly well during this period. The panning action isn't smooth, but it's reasonably stable and held my camera (a relatively small NEX-5R for most of that period) well for long exposures and video. Eventually, though, one of the little pins that hold the stabilizers to the legs broke and that was the end of its useful life.

There are a couple of levels built into the camera for checking to see if you have the tripod set up level.",5,1,2014-12-14,1,0,0

It's lightweight but well-built. When shooting outside with slow shutter speeds and with the legs fully extended I got some blur, but other than that I have no complaints whatsoever.

Compared to a more expensive one it doesn’t feel maybe as premium as other tripods but it has all the basic features of a tripod that works well.

The tripod mount has a pin near the screw to ensure the camera doesn't unintentionally swivel which is perfect for those cameras that have a corresponding hole; which my camera does not.  For me it's still equally perfect as that pin is spring loaded and easily slides out of the way if you don't need it.  Additionally, there are 2 levels built into the tripod; one on the mount and one on the front of the tripod so you can set up to get those level shots on uneven surfaces.  The pole the camera mount attaches to is different as you extend or retract it via a hand crank.

If you're a professional and plan to use it daily, I wouldn't count on it lasting for a decade (you weren't really hoping for industrial-strength quality at this price, were you?). However, for personal use, it has been more than satisfactory. I just purchased a second one for light use at work.",5,1,2016-1-6,1,0,0
This is a great product and completely worth every penny. I'm taking a photography class and this has helped my photographs a bunch.

I just walked out the door and about to go inside saw this on the porch. I had been here all day and there was no knock. I thought everything was coming tomorrow. The tripod is huge and well built.

Now just need the camera and then will get some good shots of the places I love.,5,1,2018-8-6,1,0,1
"This is a really good value. It's super light, extends very tall, comes with a carrying sack, and has a bubble level. It also features a quick release/install configuration which may or may not be desirable for all uses. You simply screw in a tapered square flat plastic ""foot"" into your camera bottom, and then you simply drop the camera/base into the tripod and twist the locking lever to secure. Twist again to release. It seems good for full sized cameras or medium camcorders, but might be more inconvenient for compact/travel cameras, where you probably wouldn't want to attach a 2+ inch square foot to your tiny camera. The unit also doesn't seem to be a fluid head, so movement is a little bit ""stuttering"". For the price, it's a good buy.",4,1,2012-12-31,1,1,0

It is so stiff that you have to use your hand to hold the tripod to pan the video camera and the picture is still jerky/shaky.

Levers for the leg height are quick and easy to adjust. Operation is very simple and allows for a solid station to take pictures with.",5,1,2016-7-11,1,0,0
I really like this tripod. I don't know I waited so long to buy one. It is very easy to use but didn't come with any instructions. It's really self explanatory but if you're not certain of anything just take your time and you can get it. There are so many things I didn't even try on the camera until I got the tripod. It made me want to learn more about my camera other then just taking your standard photo. The price is great too though that wasn't my only consideration for buying it. It came with a nice storage bag so you can keep it clean nd carry it easily. You can carry the tripod with the camera attached to it too. It has a handle that makes it very convienent. I highly recommend this product. Thank you Amazon!,5,1,2013-3-2,1,0,0
This is a great deal. I bought it on the chance that it would work out and I’ve been really happy with this tripod. I have celestron binoculars and this allows me to raise and lower the height with a little crank on the tripod.

A decent tripod. One of two tripods I have setup to hold cameras for the Oculus Rift. The two features I felt were missing from this product was an inability to lock the legs at set intervals of open. The other was that the feet did not have retractable spikes to hold it more steady.For the price though the product accomplishes what I needed it to.

"The features of this unit make it possibly the best entry-level tripod I've seen. It's quite inexpensive, yet has features not found on many much costlier pods. For example, there is a nice carry handle built into the unit (plus a bag with a carry strap). The quick set and release snaps make setup fast. Leveling bubbles and a weight hook complete the offerings. The tradeoff is that the tolerances are fairly liberal, so that the crank raises a somewhat wobbly central mount. And don't expect a liquid head, controlled resistance mount that will let you pan smoothly. Better set the camera in the position you want and then don't move it until you are through shooting. In short: attractive design, attractive price, functional basic tripod for camcorders and cameras.",4,1,2012-9-10,1,0,0

"I use this product every Wednesday and Sunday for church services. The only problem I see is the turning mechanism. When we use the handle to turn the camera in a different direction it makes a creaking noise. If you are video tapping like I am on periscope, you can hear that distracting sound. I have not figured out how to cut down on that. Also keep in mind that I am doing a180 degree turn. This problem may be something I need to address.",4,1,2016-11-2,1,0,0

"It does the job! I use a Nikon D3300 camera and it fits perfectly for the camera. Sturdy support and easy to use. I personally think you don't need an expensive tripod to be able to use it good.

Overall I happy with this for the price I paid.",4,1,2017-1-19,1,0,0
"This is a good tripod for someone who is going to be just casually shooting with it under not particularly rugged conditions.  It is VERY light, which is great if you have to lug it around, but there is a trade-off in stability for heavier cameras.  If you are using something small and light it is a perfect match.  But it is no substitute for a serious heavy tripod -- and since the point of a tripod is to keep the camera perfectly still, keep that as part of your consideration.",3,1,2016-4-20,1,0,0
"I got this tripod in February 2016. A great tripod for people new to photography. I have used the tripod to take long exposure images as well as a few HDR images. Overall, it can't be beat for the price. Additionally, it is lightweight (less than 2 lbs) but still able to be 60"" tall, allowing for less bending over to look into the view finder. My only complaint is that the mounting plate feels a little loose when it is locked into the tripod but it has never fallen out. The middle post of mine got scratched up pretty quickly from opening and closing of the tripod but its just cosmetic, did not affect the usability.",4,1,2016-3-24,1,0,0

"It is a nice looking unit. Seems to work as it should. The movements are a little rough. The parts where the camera attaches to and the whole upper part of the unit are made of cheap plastic, a little on the thin side for my taste. But I am sure this is a better choice than my balancing the camera on top of a lampshade when taking group pictures. But it does not compare to what I had expected. Perhaps I was spoiled, my father had this old tripod from the seventies that was all metal, very solid and smooth. One year we got tired of seeing it sitting in the corner of the closet and got rid of it. Bad decision, because they don't seem to make them like that anymore.",3,1,2013-12-29,1,0,0
"Had to replace the first one as the legs broke apart after using it for 1 hour on a golf course filming some different shots around the course with friends. 2nd one seems to be fine but still tough to pop back up after filming, the brackets seem to stick so I am afraid after a while this one will give way as well. Otherwise it is a decent tripod with its height and functionality.  Return of the first one was easy, right to a kohls dept store they have an amazon counter and they sent me a new one right away.",3,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
"Upon receipt it ""appeared"" to be good enough quality for the price, but while using the tripod for only the second time to take video of my child's basketball game, the pre-assembled swivel handle came off in my hand without any warning or discernible cause.  Some other small pieces or hardware fell from either the handle or the space where the handle inserts rendering the tripod useless ever since.  I was sitting in open bleachers and couldn't find what fell since I didn't even have time to see what fell.  The handle can't simply be screwed back into the insert without the other little pieces.  The handle must have had a function relating to the vertical control of the plate on which the camera rests, in addition to allow the user to swivel the camera horizontally, because now the camera flips/tilts backward as soon as I let it go.  I don't live near a tripod repair location and can't find the tripod's assembly instructions anywhere online to at least figure out what little pieces fell out.  No manual came with the tripod so this is very disappointing.  I've never had a problem I've purchased using Amazon Prime.  I hope the seller will see this and offer a helpful resolution.  I would be willing to change my rating if this is resolved appropriately.",2,1,2015-2-16,1,0,0

I was trying to fold it back up and the center pole that stabilizes the legs popped out of the socket and now it won't go back to normal. It still works (kinda) but I have no way of really adjusting it now. It's super cheaply made. It also came with no instructions which is incredibly frustrating. It's not a highly technical piece of equipment, but it's also not entirely intuitive when setting it up. The middle piece that ended up breaking on my tripod was incredibly confusing to work. It would have been nice to have had a guide of some sort to help with the process. Oh well, guess you get what you pay for.",3,1,2017-1-8,1,0,0
These are extremely similar to other off-brand tripods I have used in the past but for a much lower price. Extremely light weight and easy to setup and operate.

"I know it is only like $25, however, this product is cheap. It's 100% aluminum and plastic, and I had it for a year with nothing broken. However, the pan and tilt are really cheap. On the lowest setting, one moves more freely than the other, so you can forget any diagonal movements. And every time I try to do only one of the two, I struggle to try to make it look smooth.

The latches to extend the legs seem very durable and are very easy to open/close without them feeling loose or like they're going to fail on you (I've had some tripods like that and it was always a guessing game as if the legs would suddenly collapse or not). Great affordable tripod.",5,1,2015-8-14,1,1,0
"Do not be fooled with this lower-than-average priced basic tripod. It is a better choice than the typical walmart cheap-o tripod. After reading the countless positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase one. I was impressed that it came with a nice carrying bag that makes it a lot more convenient to carry around than just by itself. The overall construction seem to support and hold my dslr without any problems. there is also a level that is built in that can aide during set up. I have had it for about 6 months now and it is still holding strong. I was expecting this tripod to simply break or fall apart a couple months after I bought it but it still stands.

But mine works great. I am satisfied and am glad I didn't spend 25 dollars more for a name brand. Amazon basics did this one right.",5,1,2017-1-11,1,0,0
It's perfect and get's the job done. It is lightweight so sometimes it feels like the tripod is going to tip over and my camera might break  if you are having it stand above three feet. So I suggest hooking a bag that is heavy to help add some support and hold the tripod down.,4,1,2018-3-21,1,1,0
"This may be an Amazon Basics product, but it is not lacking in quality. It is versatile and easy to use. When I was researching tripods I saw the review by the guy with no arms. I figured if he could use this I could to. I love this tripod! I wanted something easy to use, but would not cost me a small fortune. I am not a professional photographer so I was not looking to pay for a professional tripod. This does everything I want it to and then some. I would recommend to any amateur photographer like me.",5,1,2015-4-18,1,1,0

I’m a singer and actor and bought this to record auditions for submissions. This tripod is PERFECT. The height when extended fully is just at eye level for me and I am 6’1”.

Wasn't expecting much from this tripod due to the price but there are so many adjustment knobs that you can't say it lacks features.

"Very simple tripod, but great! When I purchased this tripod, I spent days beforehand searching through a sea of tripods, because I didn't know anything about them. I was knew to photography and filming, that I just wanted to find the right tripod for my camera. I had read about a lot of really cheap ones that bent and broke, so I was afraid of buying one that would be complete crap. I noticed this in the suggested area when I was flipping through pages of tripods here on amazon. The reviews were pretty good and the price was decent. I'm so happy with how tall the tripod grows, as well as how small it can shrink. It's very lightweight like the title says. Easy to move around. You can adjust different portions of it in different areas. (If that makes sense) And there's a nice handle so you can move just your camera as well, and it locks in place so you can keep the camera right where it's looking. I have a Nikon D3300, which isn't the heaviest, but isn't the lightest camera either. It works well with my camera, but like I said, I do need to lock it in place or it just falls. But great tripod! Highly recommended to anyone!",5,1,2016-6-10,1,1,1

The tripod has other customizable benefits such as to allow additional height as well as adjusting angles in landscape or portrait view.

A release plate is attached to your camera so you can quickly and easily attach and remove it from the tripod without having to screw/unscrew your camera every time.

"Bought the cheapest option knowing I'd get what I paid for.

I purchased this for a college digital camera class to stabilize my pictures and am quite surprised by all the things it can do. It has the stabilizing bubbles on the frame and on the part the camera goes onto. It raises by 2 sets of pop open locks and has a fold out turn knob for raising it to full height and everything locks to secure the shot. It can also be titled to 90 degrees for those sideways shots. It comes with a nice case and is very lightweight and easy to use. The top pops out to attach the camera,5,1,2014-9-28,1,0,0
"It's a nice tripod for what you pay. It's definitely not a $200 product. But I think it's great for someone who is just learning. It has bubble levels on it and it's lightweight.

It has a decent bit of mobility as far as what you can do with the camera. The legs can extend up to the 60 inch height or you can make it very small and compact at about a foot 1/2 or so. If you don't want to pay top dollar for a tripod, this is a good choice.",4,1,2014-3-21,1,0,0

This one the cat can't knock over, it's got a nice spread on when legs are open, I guess twenty four inches or so.  It's a medium weight compared to my old on, super light weight, and this one has a spot to hang your camera bag or camera weight on it's hook for extra stablility.  it's got a nice aluminum construction, quick release plate which my old one didn't have which is a true necesity if you want to jump between tripod and hand pictures.  I shot a few pics with this and it really makes a world of defference.  I have it set up so it's just loose enough to move around, take a shot without tightening and then move to next position with a smooth movement, which my old one couldn't do, Not sure what else to add but, I definitely feel like this tripod will work nicely with my new sony rx100 for quite a while and is a real tripod to be used unlike my old one which was complete junk.  Try this is your not happy return it.

I definitly love how you can play with the tripod and adjust on how you want the height, angle, etc. I got the 60 inch which was just PERFECTION. I make YouTube videos and I love how it gets a wide shot and how steady it is! Not only was it awesome and perfect, but the packaging was 10/10.  There was box inside a box then a plastic seal then the bag and finally there was the tripod!

"I bought this back in May but finally took with out of country.  I think I might have gotten a lemon as this only lasted about 5 different shoots (waterfalls).

After a fresh coat of paint and 8 dollar modification this thing holds my 10/22 riffle nicely for night hunts. I like the handle on it which allows for easy carrying on a quick take down and relocation. For the money this works great. I can not justify the 200+ for the high speed riffle tripods.

Great for the price though!",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
First tripod I've purchase. The price is good for everything the product offers. The tripod has a great level of adjustment. I'm 5'9 and when raised to its max it's well my size. There is 2 levels to check balance. The level locks secure pretty well. I wish the tripod came with a users manual. I also wish the case it came with was just a little bit bigger. I think over time the case won't last. The tripod along with a separately sold attachment can work with a phone.,4,1,2016-2-21,1,0,0
"Somewhat disappointed in the sturdiness of the tripod.  Very light... plastic seems to be of fair quality.  I know it is for a light camcorder, but overall it seems quite flimsy compared to other, but much more expensive tripods I have purchased.  That is the point... price is very low so I think it is another case of you get what you pay for.",3,1,2016-9-21,1,0,0

For this price it is a ridiculously good bargain.",5,1,2017-10-27,1,0,0
"The first shoot I used it, this tripod broke. It's is cheaply manufactured. Two pins fell out and were lost so one of the legs came apart. I ended up having to use a toothpick to re-create the lost pin and get to the end of the shoot. It's cheap and cheaply made.. I would've gotten a nicer tripod, but this came with the camera I ordered and seemed such a good price that I decided it was worth it. Oh well. I should have known that you get what you pay for.",2,1,2015-6-23,1,0,0
"So far everything fine; nothing broken yet after 4 weeks of permanent outdoor use; more sturdy than my former one which costed twice. I use the tripod with a Sony DSLR + a 300mm telelens for still photography (mainly night shots, long exposures and close-ups). Would not recommend it for movies, as the handle is a bit too stiff for smooth panning. The hook at the bottom of the center column allows to add an extra weight for stabilization in windy conditions.",5,1,2015-11-21,1,2,0
"Bought two of these for some Celestron 15x70 Skymaster binoculars and was very happy.  The tripod is an inexpensive way to get a job done for a whole lot less than your would normally pay and it does it's job well.

I recommend for any budget conscious shopper who doesn't need something top of the line but serves it purpose.  Thanks Amazon!!!",4,1,2014-3-6,1,2,0

"This tripod is sturdy, even though it is relatively light.  The legs have quick releases, which I love - making it very quick to setup and fold back again.

"Hey a heads up to anyone thinking about buying this, I strongly recommend against it. While this tripod has a nice lightweight feel and a nice lightweight feeling on your wallet it falls apart quickly.

Great tripod for the price I returned an 80$ manfrotto because this one  is better with the raising center post and 2 levels  also only 3 leg pieces instead of the 5 on the manfrotto. It's not as compact as it could be but I'm more than happy with this 25$ tripod  easily fits into bag and the strap is long enough to fit across my chest instead of just hanging off my shoulder.All the moveable poings have twist locks so once you are.

"I purchased this tripod after the one that came with my kit unexpectedly broke... But, as the title states, so far this tripod is great!!! I have a Nikon D3300 and it holds it up just fine. Although It's pretty lightweight, you can tell it won't bend or break anytime soon. I had my other tripod for about a year before it broke so I'm hoping that this one will last a lot longer than that. It doesn't come with an instruction manual but if you play around with it, you'll get the gist of everything pretty quickly. The one thing that I can say is a bit of a flaw with this tripod is that it doesn't pan fluidly. When you're panning, there's some stops along the way. Bottom line however, it's inexpensive, lightweight, and durable and well, that's good enough for me.P.S. if you're worried about it being too short, just crank the handle at the top. :)",5,1,2016-2-7,1,0,0

"I purchased two. I bought one and thought the problem was unique and Amazon replaced it and I had the same problem. Basically, the knob/crank that holds the head plate on which your camera sits cannot be tightened down to be stable.

We set up the tripod on a stream bank, on muddy ground, and on uneven terrain and I didn’t feel worried about my camera at all.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,1
Great tripod.  I love all the different options you have with viewing angles using your cell phone.  The legs also adjust to different lengths and there is a lever in the middle which allows your camera to rise up even higher.  I paired this with the cell phone adapter here.Ulanzi ST-01,5,1,2017-5-6,1,0,0

I got a tripod that came in the kit with my camera but I never felt safe putting my precious camera on it.  This one was suggested by a dear friend who has the same camera - canon t5i.  I love my camera and I love this tripod.  It does all I'd like it to do.  Including vertical and horizontal shots.  Has the levels on it.  Comes in a carry bag for convenience.

"I honestly spent hours looking at tripod reviews to figure out which one I should buy. I got this one because of the features and the price. It was lower priced than many of the tripods that I looked at but I'm not fancy. Just wanted a tripod. Well, this thing IS fancy! It has a removable foot that attaches to your camera so you can quickly remove your camera from the tripod if you want to switch between tripod and handheld shooting! It is heavy duty and I can't imagine it tearing up in my lifetime. I love the bag too! Thank you so much, Amazon, for making a super nice tripod affordable and such great quality at the same time!!!",5,1,2013-8-13,1,0,0
"This tripod works much better than the ratty old thing I had been using, an old cast-off from somewhere.  This one is light and handy, adjusts easily, and works smoothly.The attachment for the camera has it's own thumb-screw, no more fishing for a coin to tighten.  The tightening levers for the legs work to the side, which is much handier than the vertical levers I had on the old one.  And, a nice little carrying case.  Hard to go wrong.",4,1,2015-7-22,1,0,0
"Great for the price! Has all the bells and whistles of any tripod and comes in a nice little carrying bag. I have purchased again for my job and everyone that's used them like them. I've used for taking pictures and videos. My only qualm is that when taping video, even with it as loose as it will go, the head does not turn quite as smoothly as I would like but in the end the video is not that bad. Seemed worse when I was taping. The up and down motion is great.",4,1,2015-4-9,1,2,1
"This is just what I needed! I don't use a tripod with my work all that often, so I didn't need anything too fancy, but this is perfect for what I need it for. I love that you can hook your camera onto the top and then if you need to take it off quickly, there is a quick release lever so I can take it off quickly during a session....I just need to remember to put that piece back on the tripod for the next time I use it!

"Offers a lot for the money. That's the key here. Much of the controls and levers look plasticy and cheaply made. For instance, the legs on the bottom of each pod rotates loosely on a plastic hinge. Doesn't look substantial. Previous tripod I had came with bigger tips that screwed out more than an inch to give it more stability especially on uneven ground.I intend to use this mainly indoors on level floors. Wouldn't take this on a field trip. Wouldn't trust its durability. But like I said for indoor shots it should work just fine.",4,1,2015-1-29,1,0,0
great for the price. If you are however a professional Id invest in a better one. My only complaint about these less expensive tripods is the swivel at the top. It doesn't adjust easily enough. Very jerky and juttery to try and adjust it. I know some of the more high-end tripods are fluid when adjusting which makes it much easier.,5,1,2016-5-19,1,0,0
"I don't normally write reviews, but I just had to throw in a big ""thumbs up"" for this tripod.  For the price, I wasn't really expecting much.  But this thing is amazingly sturdy!  From the moment I first pulled it out of the included carrying bag, I could just feel the quality of of it.But the biggest surprise was yet to come!  This tripod contains features I didn't even know you could get on a tripod!  For example, the attachment base (or ""foot"" or whatever it's called) completely detaches from the rest of the tripod!  Since I pretty much use only my video camera on the tripod, I can just detach the base from the tripod and leave it attached to the video camera.  Then, whenever I want to re-attach the camera to the tripod, I can just pop the base back on in a second and I'm ready to go!",5,1,2015-12-25,1,0,0
"I waited too long to open this to be able to return it.  The screw in handle that lets you tighten the tilting joint wont engage the thread.

Will adjust the rating if I get a working replacement.",1,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"I had a tripod that was more than twice as expensive as this one and it totally fell apart.  This tripod has been sturdy and functional.

Product was delivered as expected. Decent shipping time and packaged well. Good for the price. Not heavy duty but gets the job done. Compatible with both my Sony Cybershot (my kids use) as well as my Nikon DSLR. It's easy to store when not in use.

"Very lightweight, feels pretty flimsy -- don't know how durable it will be -- but then it's a $20 tripod.  It should probably receive 5 stars in it's class.

If you just want something for indoor or occasional use, this will probably do the trick.  If your going to be dragging in into the woods and mountains, you may want to go with something a bit more rugged -- or you could buy 4 or 5 of these and just throw them away as they break.",4,1,2013-12-5,1,0,0

"The tripod works exactly as it should, and is very stable in terms of the legs and the extension neck at the top. The axis motions are smooth and are easily locked. However, the clamp that fastens the camera in place is not particularly tight. There is a sort of spring-loaded tab that holds the clamp open when there is no camera, and that tab keeps the camera in place against the clamp, but there is a few millimeters of give. I don't know if that is a particularly clear explanation, but the result is that there is some springiness between the camera and the tripod.",3,1,2013-3-13,1,3,0

"Considering the price it's a good tripod for small cameras. So far I've used it with my phone only. The only thing that I don't like is the pan.

"This tripod is great for someone who is just starting out.  I bought one of these back in 2012 and I haven't had a single issue with it in terms of breaking or just wear and tear.  I've tested it's durability too by taking it out in the woods multiple times, using it in water, using it in snow, and just typical dropping/bumping it against stuff.  At the time, I was just looking for a tripod for my Canon T3i and didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This one has really impressed me and the only reason I don't use it now is because I need one that is sturdier and can hold more weight.  As I said though, this is a great option for anyone who's just starting out in photography or video.  I never had a problem with it when I was using my T3i, however I've since acquired a Black Magic Cinema Camera and it is pretty heavy.  This tripod wobbles too much when using it, but it wasn't built for that type of use.  If you're looking for a simple tripod that'll get the job done, I would recommend this one.",5,1,2015-2-17,1,0,0

Wow... so impressed at the quality for the price!  I was floored when I got it in the mail.  My only issue is the little spring tab button thing on the quick release base.  I have a sony digital and bottom of the camera is not flat.  The little spring-up metal button (not sure why this is even there) doesn't allow easy screw on of the camera to the quick release base.  So I had to tape it down to screw the camera to the quick release base.  But otherwise great quality!!!,5,1,2015-11-30,1,0,0

Great product at a great price.  This one has gone through a couple of baseball seasons and it's lasted like a champ!  The 60 inch height is perfect for looking over the backstop.

Amazing! I love having it. I debated between getting this or the 50inch because of price and this is totally worth the extra and has proven to be useful! It's even lighter than I thought it would be but there's a place to hang a weight to weigh it down if you need it. I love the versatility of it! I would definitely recommend! One of the best things is that it has a built in level! I didn't know that until I got it. It's super convenient if you're shooting on a hill or a slanted floor to produce the best result.,5,1,2017-4-1,1,0,0

It also has a hook on the bottom if you want to attach something heavy so that the tripod doesn't move around. All around it's a great tripod!,5,1,2017-5-22,1,0,0

"I purchased this for a budding photographer in the family.  In comparison this tripod equals the quality of much higher priced tripods.  I'm sure there are better ones on the market,  but they are most likely much higher in price.  I have two of these, one for a still camera and one for a movie camera.  I keep the attachment hooked to the cameras so they are easy to pop right onto the tripod.  Super product for the money.",5,1,2014-12-28,1,0,0

That being said, it's not very durable--- within one month of use, a plastic piece fell off of it--- I'm not even sure what that plastic piece was for, but it was obviously not meant to break off.Either way, it still works, so I won't be replacing it unless something more important breaks off.",3,1,2016-8-22,1,0,0
"I bought this in a bit of a pinch for some pictures my friend asked me to take. From reading the reviews, I expected this would meet my needs and having received the item I still suspect that it will.However, bear in mind that this is a ~$25 tripod. It is extremely lightweight and not overly sturdy. My camera setup is a bit much for it (DSLR, Vertical/Battery Grip, External Flash, Lens) and the tripod is less than 100% steady when the lift arm is extended at all. This is in no way, shape, nor form a high end item. It is a barebones tripod. It will suit my needs of something to use for group pictures in light or with flash but absolutely would not be usable for extended exposures in anything but ideal conditions (no wind, remotely triggered shutter, etc.).",3,1,2014-3-15,1,5,0

The quick release camera plate lets you quickly with a single lever, remove the camera from the tripod, nice when you want to go handheld quickly.Where it starts to fall apart is when you're shooting video and you need to pan. The problem is that the joints are all plastic and when you have everything such as the tilt locked down, there's still movement and this shows up in your videos. When you pan from side to side, you can feel the plastic parts that are sliding against each other ""grabbing"" a little bit.

This is an update of my first review which is down below.  I changed my star rating because I finally contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement right away.  What I said originally about this tripod being light duty and fragile still stands but if you are careful with this product it is quite good considering the price.  And it is light to carry.  I have a very high quality heavy duty tripod that is built really solid.  When you put a camera on it you know that it is on a stable platform.  But it is not something you want to carry very far.  I also have a small /tiny tripod with little legs for putting on the ground or using the velcro strap to wrap around a tree or fence post.  The thing is you need a regular three legged tripod a lot of the time.  And this one is very good for light duty with a careful user.So I plan to use this on our trip out to Death Valley in ten days and if it does not break I will be very happy with this product.  I liked the first one as it has all the regular features you need but in a light duty version.,4,1,2018-2-15,1,1,0

"This is pretty well thought out for a lightweight tripod, and my intent was to take this for trekking because it is so lightweight. However, what I found was that the quick-disconnect plate that attaches to the bottom of one's camera does not fit precisely in the tripod assembly base plate and has some slight ""wiggle"" room. So even with just a not-so-large telephoto lens (200 mm) and low-light conditions or max zoom where one is manually and precise focusing; I found this 2-3 degrees of play to be very annoying as one would experience a lot of camera shake attempting to do so--which sucked up some time. Then it was also difficult to keep the subject focused in the center of the camera without trying to ratchet down super-tight, the vertical pan. (In this specific instance I was shooting longer-exposure shots of a partial moon rising in the morning with a 70-200 mm lens.) If one only is interested in daytime, non-extreme telephoto and non-precise or auto-focus shots, then it should work out great, because it is light-weight and otherwise smartly designed. Next iteration should have a more precise fitting of the quick-disconnect and tripod base plate.",3,1,2014-11-22,1,3,0

As others have mentioned in their reviews, rotating the camera to get a panned shot is not smooth, so if you're videoing there will be ""bumps and jolts"" to the video.  For still photos, it's not an issue.  I don't recommend buying this tripod for videos or panning.",3,1,2015-2-17,1,0,0

"I'm a photography newbie, just started learning it. So I'll give little different POV. This is supposed to be an affordable and basic tripod. Nothing wrong with the concept. But I didn't like it. One of the reason was weight, it's 2.7 lb, I have heavier, more sturdy tripod but wanted another much lighter tripod to carry it everywhere, so I thought it'd be good fit for that purpose. Unfortunately, I felt it's not really comfortable to be with all the time. Probably it was made from plastic and very bulky, so carrying it was little trouble to me.Also, ""basic"" doesn't mean it's for DSLR newbies. After learning basic photo shooting techniques, I quickly get annoyed its limited shooting positions. I shoot variety of projects from night sky, portrait, landscape, or macro. Sometime I put tripod on sandy beach or rocky surface. In that situations, connectors of legs and center pole prevent flexible positioning. This tripod might be great for certain type of photography, like cityscape, or anything you could expect flat and solid surface shooting. But other than that, I'd recommend to invest little more expensive, flexible tripod, like ball head ones for photography newbies.",2,1,2016-2-23,1,2,0

"...with all the pros and cons of both qualities. It hasn't busted yet (that's a pro), but it isn't at all easy to position or manuever (that's a con). Gets the job done, just so long as the job doesn't require smooth movement of the camera or speedy setup/takedown.",3,1,2015-11-18,1,0,0
"I don't believe that tripods should be ""lightweight."" Yes, they shouldnt be 30lbs, But its extremely light. so light that I feel a heavy camera would be very risky to attach this too, such as a DSLR or bigger! My Samsung Camera isn't bulky or heavy so I'm not afraid at all to trust this Tripod with it. It twists into the tripod very easily and has a very secure grip on it. ALL THE BLACK MATERIAL YOU SEE IS PLASTIC. THE ONLY METAL IS THE SILVER POLES and Screw that lets you screw the camera onto the tripod. Definitely has that ""cheap feel"" but hey what did you expect?ITS 20 BUCKS! You honestly cant go wrong with this product if youre a beginner and/or have a lighter camera than a DSLR. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TRIPOD, IF SO. 60 inches is the perfect height. Any smaller i'd be upset and disappointed. if you plan on using it to record things in motion, like moving the tripod from left to right, keep looking for a different tripod. I say this because, it can be stiff sometimes and this would make the video NOT have that smooth look when taping something in motion.",4,1,2016-3-28,1,2,0

"This is the worst thing I've seen with the Amazon Basics name attached.  This is absolute crap.  The mechanism that does the tilt/swivel is laughably nasty to use, and the latch that is meant to hold the part that you'd affix to your camera is so badly designed it causes harm.  I'm not kidding.  I destroyed a lovely pair of binoculars (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AM87Q4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&th=1) that are meant to be tripod mounted, because with the slightest pressure the latch holding your gear on the tripod with just give out.

"It's easy to set the height, easy to release the camera mounting bracket, easy to see the leveling bubble.

Very lightweight and easy to use. If you need a basic camera tripod for basic use I can not recommend it high enough. If you need a heavy duty professional tripod you'll want to pick something else up. For me it was exactly what I wanted.,5,1,2016-1-18,1,0,0
"I loved it for 2 months and took good care of it and then one day as I was adjusting one of the legs, it completely came off and is not working right anymore ever though i put the leg back on.. I'd say invest in one that is a little better put together. This tripod is great for traveling though but definitely be careful with it if you choose to buy it!",3,1,2018-4-21,1,0,0
"I use this tripod about 3 times a week, and I'll never go to another tripod, The fact that it's lightweight makes it easy to bring with me and make me not feel like I'm being dragged down with this and all of the other stuff I carry in my bag. If it's windy I just hand a small sandbag I made from the hook on the bottom and then it helps it stay more steady. Fantastic tripod!",5,1,2016-3-5,1,0,0
"No bargain here. It's not uncommon for me to find what I believe to be a real bargain on amazon warehouse deals but that is not the case with this tripod. Make no mistake, this is a very cheaply built tripod that is wobbly and loose. The center plastic nut that locks it in the open position fell off the very first time i opened it in my family room, not a good start. The rubber feet just press on and swivel, they fall off very easily apparently because  I walked about a half a mile away from my truck to try and spot some deer in a canyon. I mounted my lupould binoculars on it and couldn't make out anything worth viewing. There was a slight breeze about 5mph and it would shake the tripod enough that the I couldn't focus on anything. When I returned to the truck I noticed one of the feet had fallen off. I wasn't about to walk back looking for a 3/4 inch round piece of rubber so now after the first use its already missing pieces.  I think this would be a good tripod to have in a closet to mount a camera on and take family pictures a few times a year. If you are careful with it.",3,1,2017-10-31,1,1,0

I was looking for a basic tripod to start with and this one seemed to fit my budget. The 3-way pan adjustment is smooth and the fact that they include the bag for the price is an added plus. The one drawback is that the bag does not have a side handle and hanging it on the shoulder at all times can be tiring (the shoulder strap is also slightly shorter than I would like). I haven't had a chance to test the tripod in windy conditions but it held up well in a light breeze.,5,1,2014-5-7,1,0,0

"Never having used a tripod before, I didn't know quite what to expect, so I relied on the Amazon Basics brand, and the buyer ratings. I can see why they like this tripod! Light weight, but still so sturdy. It is NOT creaky or flimsy. The joints are tight. No wobble at all. There is even a handle to carry the tripod around after you get the camera positioned just right. I don't know who designed this tripod, but I'd like to thank him/her for thinking of everything!There are several height adjustments, starting at about 25"" from the floor. The telescoping legs adjust with a flip of your thumb on the generously sized clamps, which hold the sections tightly. You can level each leg independently of the other two, in case you're shooting on a hill.",5,1,2015-10-7,1,0,0

It adjusts, easily, smoothly, and intuitively. It is reasonably light, though not light enough for hiking. It is also quite bulky, even when collapsed. The reason for the bulk is that this is the larger version of this tripod--they make a smaller version that might be of more practical use to many. For those who care about such things, the legs are constrained in how far they can swing out and cannot swing out independently of each other.

"It's not that I hate it, but when I opened the box the wing-nut screw that controls the tilt mechanism fell out of it's slot.

When I figured it out and attempted to screw it back in it would never screw in tightly, you could twist it endlessly, but it seemed to stay in so I assumed it was okay. Well, it arrived on 1/3/17, and on 3/16/17 the screw came out again and the entire camera fell off along with the top piece that the camera secures to, hitting the edge of my paver patio.  Now my telephoto lens won't zoom out all the way, and I'm heartbroken.  I will continue to attempt to discover is this item is still under warranty but that information hasn't been easy to come by.

"I was actually impressed with this tripod, as it is my 1st, and it got the job done. However, after one year of moderate use the thing LITERALLY started falling apart! I am anal with all my camera equipment and like to keep it in good shape. I never dropped the product, or anything crazy just regular ""tripod use."" Two of the aluminum bars that are attached to the tripod lost a screw and magically fell and now the tripod cannoit balance properly without it. Despite this deficiency, I still went along and used it because, hey the tripid is cheap in price. The last straw was when one of the tripod legs literally snapped off while I was capturing a long exposure. Luckily, I caught my D750 before it fell face 1st , my 24-70mm would have likely shattered! This is unacceptable quality. Anytime a product literally breaks apart through light use is a huge red flag for me, as it should for anyone. I am a loyal Amazon customer and RARELY write reviews, but after my camera almost broke because of this cheap quality product I felt obligated to write a review.. Amazon if you are reading this I demand a product replacement.Buyers beware of possible tripod leg snapping, it could cost you alot if your camera or expensive lens breaks!",3,1,2016-1-27,1,2,0

"Adding a superb to what everyone else here has written, adding a caution. When unloading from an SUV I stood the tripod, re-packed in its case, up against the outside of the van.  VERY bad move. It's unstable like this, toppled over, hit the pavement. Of course it had to be the locking handle that got pranged, deep inside the inner part of the handle is a washer, the rim of that washer got sheared off from its mount --- now the locking handle won't. I can do a workaround b/c the shoe still fits securely on three of the four sides of its mounting ridges, and I can make it work by firmly holding the cam in place.... losing the use of one hand.  This all happened after a night shoot with an intact tripod, gave me no problems at all, a great value for the low price.  Going out again today (Wed Sept 7) to the Pacific seacoast for another shoot in twilight, early darkness, so we will see.  A little surprised that this damage was inflicted so easily, prob either have to replace the whole turret or the whole tripod itself, my hunch is that it will be much less expensive to buy a new tripod.
