"A little strange to not see your volume level (no display), but the sound quality is fantastic. I have it mounted to my TV, which is mounted to the wall - it all looks very nice and clean. Bluetooth connectivity is great - I can pair it to my phone to play music or podcasts and simply switch it back over to the TV.",5,1,2017-1-30,1,1,0
"I've was going back and forth about buying this speaker after some of the reviews I read, and I continued to go back and forth on it once I got it and heard it's performance. The first thing I noticed is that it really does enhance voices. It also does an excellent job on the midranges and highs, but the bass is definitely lacking. I just kept saying to myself ""this isn't worth the money so I decided to send it back to Amazon and they emailed me a return label for shipping. I was told that I have 30 days to return it so I was in no rush to return it, which may have been a good thing because after a week of using it I've discovered a few positive things about it which have given me a change of heart. So here's the deal...Regarding the lack of bass, while I was expecting more, what I have discovered that it does give you nice bass when it's supposed to. If your watching certain channels, the bass actually sounds pretty good, whereas watching news channels like Fox and CNN the voices are completely without bass, but, this is due to the audio output of the news channel, and while not all TV channels are created equal, neither are movies and shows on Amazon and Netflix. With the first Amazon series it delivered little or no bass, but yesterday I began watching a new series and with that it delivers beautiful bass. This is what I mean about delivering bass when it's supposed to! Does it deliver bass quality matching that of higher priced soundbars with sub-woofers? No, but considering it's small size, it puts out some pretty nice sound when there's heavy bass present in the TV audio. My advice to you would be to use it with the bass adjustment all the way up while not using the voice enhancement option which actually lowers the bass, and in my opinion, makes the voices a bit too tinny.  It also performs more like a Bose speaker when streaming music through it. Lots of bass for that. Hope this helps!",4,1,2019-8-17,1,3,0
"Very disappointed in this product. Purchased this product on April 20, 2017 and as of September 1, 2017, we are unable to operate the volume of the unit with the remote control. We have replaced the batteries in the remote and still the system is difficult to control the volume. It is intermittent. I would think the product would be covered with a warranty and last longer than 5 months of use. Very disappointed after paying $249.00 for this unit. Won't be purchasing further Bose products.",1,1,2017-9-14,1,7,0

"I originally ordered this for my wife as she has a hard time hearing the dialog in TV shows, movies, etc.  I have a nice Polk Audio sound bar with subwoofer that has worked well for us, but thought maybe the Bose could compete with the sound output plus give us the extra dialog advantage.The install was simple and I used an optical cable for install.  That and the size of the unit are about the end of my positive feedback.  Don't get me wrong, if you want this for dialog clarity, it will give you that.  Just don't expect much other sound when in the dialog mode that is separate from normal mode.",2,1,2018-11-30,1,2,0
"After a lifetime of working in and around industrial sites my husband is a bit hard of hearing. We are constantly battling over the sound of the TV... I can hear normally, so when he puts the sound at level he can hear the conversations, it feels like it is blasting our my ear drums!  We've had several sets of headphones... they are uncomfortable and he then can't hear me if I am asking him something...  so we decided to give this a try.  A couple of things... neither of are ""techies"" and were able to plug into our newer (less than 2 months old Samsung 65"" TV) in an instant.  So that was good.  If you turn it on it is an amazing sound upgrade from your TV sound system.  Very noticeable.  When you push the little conversation icon which is supposed to ""enhance"" the conversation portion of the sound, it is noticeable.  Perhaps not as dramatic, but it helps.  We are able to find a happy medium.  You are able to adjust the bass when you don't feel like having the ""theater"" experience.  It is a ""bar"" that sits just below our wall - hung TV.  It's about 30 or so inches long and about 3"" tall.  It does have the Bose logo right in the middle.  At first I wasn't thrilled about looking at it ... but I find I don't notice it now and it sort of helps to hide the cords - bonus.  As noted on other reviews... you do have to click on the ""conversation icon"" to ""enhance"" the conversation sound every single time you turn it on.  It would be nice if it just stayed on that position.  Also, it would NOT ""learn"" my new Samsung blue ray player or my TV... so the ""universal remote"" thing is not really happening.  The remote is very large and cumbersome for just turning on and off the sound bar...  I even researched the internet to be certain I had the right ""universal codes"" for my DVD player... Still didn't work.  So.... if you don't really care about adding just one more remote the sound quality is truly an upgrade from your TV. It really makes the sound match the quality of the picture I am seeing on my TV.  The conversation enhancement is noticeable, but maybe not as dramatic as you might hope - still - it's helpful.  We are definitely keeping it.  I never shy away from updating my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Further, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.",4,1,2016-8-8,1,2,0
"I was hesitant when I first purchased this product. I didn't know if it was going to be a knock off, or if it was going to have problems once I installed it. This is the REAL DEAL! I love the sound. It was super easy to install. It's sleek, it's powerful and the price was PERFECT!",5,1,2017-1-19,1,5,0
"Honestly, this isn't much better than my TV speakers (2014 Samsung 48"" UNH6350) - Really, the only difference is that the Bose Solo 5 has a little bass AND more centered speakers. Compared to the TV speakers, which are more stereoscopic (even if they are rear-facing) the sound coming from the Bose Solo 5 is a little crisper (tinier) and barely stereo. In fact, the best set-up so far is to have both the TV rear facing speakers AND the Bose Solo 5 speakers enabled at the same time. I get a much richer audio experience with proper stereo from the TV and a crisper high's and more bass in the center from the Bose.The remote is awesome, however. The code worked fine and I'm able to use it normally, though, with both the TV speakers AND the Bose speaker enabled, It doesn't cut down on a remote. (Do universal remotes ever do?)",3,1,2017-12-4,1,3,0
"Some fifty plus years ago I took Prof Bose's Network course at MIT, 6.01. Several friends and colleagues went with Amar to Bose. My wife and colleagues at MIT built Bose speakers which we still have. Thus I thought this would be a great little speaker.The sound is not bad for the price and the system works well as a separate speaker if you ignore all the directions. The problem:",3,1,2019-8-16,1,1,0
"Solo 5 best for small rooms/less than 50"" tv's. Adequate sound for the price but not the what I expect from Bose. I have owned Bose for decades (Lifestyle, sound bars, radio) but now conclude Bose is no longer the sound technology leader it was 20 yrs ago yet they command the price differential. There are better sound bars available at this price point (my Samsung sounds better, same room, same tv, better/simpler remote).PRO:",4,1,2018-11-4,1,2,0

This product was great until it just stopped working. It’s only been one year! I thought Bose had a much better product than this:( WHAT A JOKE!!! $250 for one year then it breaks on me right at the 1 year mark.

"My old boyfriend had a Bose system in his car and it sounded amazing.  My sister has that radio/CD combo they promoted on TV for years and it sounds amazing.  Last year I broke down and got the little portable $100 unit to use with my kindle.  I couldn't believe I finally got myself a Bose and it was also AMAZING!  The clarity and richness of the sound blew me away.  I just wanted MORE!  I had a Vizio soundbar that suddenly wasn't so appealing.  It was a big decision to upgrade a perfectly functional soundbar that was expensive enough but I had become a Bose addict.Now I'm not suggesting this is a knock off and I don't think it is but I was shocked that it didn't sound any different than the Vizio (if not worse).  Trying to deflect the scorn of my husband I marveled at the new  ""Dialogue Mode"" which also wasn't impressive.  Unwilling to admit my mistake it stayed.",2,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
"Compact, doesn’t block the eye on my tv for the remote control. The only thing I don’t like is there is no interface, what number is the volume level? The bass level?  No on off switch without the remote control.Comes with an optical instead of an hdmi. Honestly my tv came with more smart features and wasn’t much more expensive.  Subwoofer is blah, I still need to plug in my real woofer for any depth of sound otherwise voices sound funky.",3,1,2020-1-13,1,2,0
I really don't know what to say. I have a Yamaha Amp and all Bose speakers but the amp is old and it just has to many wires. I had a Vizio sound bar with bluetooth sub and could mate any bluetooth sound device to that unit and it was almost comparative to my Yam/Bose system at 2/3 the price of this soundbar.  Sadly after several years of use distance of bluetooth started to diminish and when it wouldn't reach the sub any more it was time to go.I have not had a soundbar for two or three years since disposing the Vizio. We bought a new OLED LG television last year and honestly the sound is great. I saw this Bose unit and figured it would be an improvement to our television watching experience. It wasn't ! The quality was terrible with an almost muffled sound that added nothing to the experience of watching television. I thought maybe it was me but after inviting several friends over their opinion mirrored mine.,1,1,2019-12-20,1,2,0
"If you’re looking for great sound and you don’t need something to shake the walls, this is what you want. I’ve tried it with movies, tv shows, ball games...the sound is clear and you hear everything you should. I’m hearing dialogue in the background of movies I’ve seen countless times that I had never heard before. You’ll never go back to tv speakers again. My only critique is that the remote is a bit excessive. I already have a remote to control everything else and it seemed like a bit much to me to have that for a sound bar remote, but at least you can set it to turn everything, including the sound bar, off all at once so you will have to judge the usefulness for yourself. Finally, this does come with an optical cable. I don’t know why Amazon wants to sell you one with it because it’s not necessary.",5,1,2019-5-12,1,3,1
"I don't feel like this has the same audio quality I've heard from other Bose products. I've owned many, and I use their quiet comfort headphones on a regular basis when travelling. I decided to take a chance with a deal on a used Bose soundbar. The price was right, and I just needed it for a TV with less than optimal sound in my guest bedroom. I expected the same sound quality that I'd heard from other Bose products.This, however, seems a bit more mid heavy and lacks much bass punch. I expected a bit more from Bose, as even their tiniest Bluetooth speakers sound pretty decent. It's definitely a step up from the TV speakers, but if I had to do it again, I would pick a soundbar with a proper subwoofer.",3,1,2020-1-21,1,1,0
"I am very impressed with this sound bar. I've watched a few movies with it hooked up to my TV. It certainly has amazing sound for its size. Is exactly what I was hoping to find. I was looking for a sound bar that was relatively short in length and compact. This one just the bill perfectly. I wouldn't recommend it for large rooms. Fortunately I live in a small apartment and this feels the room with amazingly clear sound. I own two other Bose products and they have not disappointed me at all. I can say the same for this product I washed one movie with a friend of mine who is hard of hearing so we had to have it turned up rather loud and I had to turn it down multiple times so that we could discuss the movie. I have had it turned up to the max volume and it does not become distorted at all.It took me about an hour to figure out how to program the universal remote to my TV. This is probably the biggest challenge I had while setting up the sound bar. I would highly recommend this to anyone who lives in a small apartment as I do or to anyone who is looking for a good quality Bluetooth speaker. The universal remote took the place of two of my other remotes and takes a bit of getting used to. All in all it is a very nice well-built, well designed remote.",5,1,2019-9-2,1,1,0
"I bought the product based on the Bose name recognition for good speakers. Big mistake. These guys still live in the dark ages. It is 2020 and one expects a small display (like Samsung and other brands have) to tell you what is going on with your sound bar. Instead there are only two lcd lights (like in the 1970s) that you have to guess based on the color what they mean. There is no indicator for volume level so you have no idea where you are. Absolutely unacceptable. You do not know which input is on because you just pressed the input button on the remote and after a second the light is gone. The sound is not better than my Visio TV. I do not even know why I kept the bar, probably I am too lazy to repackage it and ship it back. The speech is somewhat improved but that is no reason to spend $180. All in all it feels like a cheap imitation, do yourself a favor do not buy this Bose product. Once upon a time Bose was equivalent of sound quality, not any longer and if they stay like this behind the other competitors they will be soon without customers. I gave it two stars but even that is too much for such a weak sound.Second thought:",4,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"This sound bar did not live up to the Bose name. The sound is really bad, at low volume it sounds great at mid volume there is a lot of noice coming from the speakers, bass is lacking, the Bose mini soundlink sounds louder and a lot better than this. At high volume there is a ringing noise that sounds like the dog whistle application you can get on your phone. Will not recommend this product if planning to listen to it at anything other than low volume.",2,1,2018-11-28,1,4,0
"Hook up was a breeze and I'm a completely non-technical person.  Took about 10 minutes and I was going very slow and deliberately.  I really like the sound - it doesn't separate the music all that well but it's only a couple feet + long so I didn't expect it to do so - the bass is good, very clear and distinct.  As I'm 66 years old, I got it to help me understand the dialogue better when we watch movies - the button on the remote to clarify the dialogue is helpful - haven't watched enough flicks to judge definitively - I'll check back later with an update on it.",4,1,2017-8-23,1,2,0
"Got the Solo 5 to improve on the internal speakers on a 24"" TV in our bedroom.  Have used Bose speakers for years, love the Bose sound, and was looking for the Solo 5 to provide the good, rich, natural sound I associate with Bose.  Total fiasco.  The Solo 5 sound was thin and tinny.  As far from rich and natural as can be.  Barely heard any bass, even with bass control turned up.  Immediately returned the Solo 5 and ordered the Edifier R1850DB Active Bookshelf Speakers.  Got them next day with free delivery via my Amazon Prime membership.  Like the Solo 5, the Edifier speakers can be fed with an optical digital audio cable (included) - the only audio output jack on our Samsung TV.  The Edifiers are admittedly a bit bigger and bulkier, but they still fit our limited space in the bedroom. And most important, they sound great -- just the sort of sound I was hoping for but never got from the Solo 5.  Oh, and one thing more: they're cheaper than the Solo 5.",1,1,2017-12-3,1,3,0
"I was excited to come home and set this up but I was soon to be let down. Bose knows sound, Bose knows audio. Unfortunately they missed it with this one.Pros: easy installation, very good looking.",1,1,2016-11-29,1,1,0
"I love my Bose Solo TV sound system as my new slim TV does not have the speakers that my old very large TV had.  This sound bar gives the deep rich tone that all quality speakers have and makes it easier to understand voices and music.  The only problem I have is that the Bose and  TV are in the bedroom, and the bass is very dominate on this speaker, so if I forget to turn the bass down, my husband and my dog let me know.  The only negative statement I have about this sound bar is it should allow you to set the bass level where you want it to be and hold it there - currently when you turn the TV off, the Bose sound bar reverts back to the factory set bass level.  I recommend this purchase.",5,1,2018-7-18,1,1,0

"remote pairing with my Phillips TV and Fios is not working very easily. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or what, but when I turn on the TV, the sound bar doesn't come on, and if I turn on sound bar separately after I turn on the TV, the TV cuts out or Fios... Also on FIOS whenever I switch to the YouTube channel from the FIOS guide, the soundbar blanks out and we hear no sound.  very dissatisfied.",1,1,2018-8-25,1,1,0
"I considering myself a casual audiophile. It's not my hobby, but I appreciate equipment that works well. I was having a hard time hearing dialog from my aging Panasonic plasma TV. Options were limited due to my narrow TV stand, a re-purposed stereo rack. I'm not normally a Bose fan, but this had the right width, lots of good reviews and a decent, if high-ish, price.Dialog, as expected, is fine. Noticed that orchestral music in soundtracks is surprisingly full and rich. Decent bass reproduction, but bear in mind that you won't hear much unless your movie or show has deep bass- it can't reproduce what's not there!  Built-in amp seems sufficient. Haven't cranked it all the way up, but I've gone as loud as I like with hardly any noticeable distortion. Haven't tested it much as a BlueTooth music speaker, but I expect that it'll do fine.",4,1,2020-3-20,1,1,0

"For just just myself I would have bought a larger sound system, but my other half was not a fan of that idea. Perhaps in the next house.The Solo 5 is much better than the Sony X900F TV speakers. Some bass versus very little base. A fuller mid-range and gets rid of the tinniness. Music played over it is very pleasant.",4,1,2019-1-4,1,1,1
We had a Vizio soundbar for years but always had an issue with the dialogue in movies. The background noise and music would drown out the dialogue and it was a constant battle between my husband and I. He’d switch the sound back to TV and then I’d switch it back to the soundbar.This was well worth the splurge. I already had a couple of Bose Bluetooth speakers so knew I liked the sound quality. It took minutes to set up. I programmed my cable remote to control the soundbar rather than using the included universal remote. We’re both really happy with the sound. Much richer than the other soundbar and 100x better than the TVs internal speakers. No more problems hearing dialogue.,5,1,2019-1-27,1,1,0
We bought this due to our frustration with unclear dialogue with our Vizio TV.  It was easy to set up and has definitely improved our TV experience.  We also have it connected via Bluetooth to our Echo Show.  There's not much physical separation between the left and right channels so don't buy it to get a home theater experience.  But if you find yourself using closed captioning because you can hear but not understand what people say this is an excellent choice.,5,1,2018-2-14,1,1,0
"Purchased this to get some better sound out of a wall mounted TV without having to go to the trouble of getting a receiver, etc.  The only way to adjust the volume is to use their proprietary remote control.  We have Comcast Xfinity which also has a proprietary remote for changing channels, but has the capability of controlling other devices. I've seen in some of the reviews that BOSE doesn't have a code for operating this unit and prefers to have you use their included universal remote which does NOT work with Comcast Xfinity functionality. The unit is basically worthless as even when you control it, there is no feedback to indicate sound level setting. As far as sound output, the crappy speakers on the wall mounted TV sound just as good as the BOSE and you can't tell the difference.  Thought BOSE would offer some clarity of sound, but it just doesn't deliver.... Wasted purchase.",1,1,2020-8-4,1,3,0
"Unit was very well made, but thatis the best I can say!  If thhis device came on the scene 5 or 6 years, it would have been in the top 25% of soundbars, but today, it is less than so-so.  The control would not pair with my Samsung smart TV or latest Comcast cabel box ( and yes I ran through all the codes).  The vocal enhancement is inferior to that on the Samsung smart TV.  The Bose unit only has ""bass"" control, and that goes quickly from a fake boomy to nothing in a click or three on the remote-again, the Samsung TV needs adjusted to tailor the sound and, unfortunately, needs redone for each source.OK, who is this good for?  I would suggest a smallish college dorm, for occassional listening.  But, again, way over priced!  If this were a $75.00 unit, instead of $200.00 and you were making your first foray into music different than MP3 downloads, you might like it.  But I've had this now several weeks, trying to let the speakers burn in, but if anything, the sound only gets more aggravating.  It is well built, though!",2,1,2019-11-3,1,3,0
"We bought this soundbar for a TV in our bedroom that is wall mounted.  We mounted the Bose Solo 5 on the wall just under the TV.  The improvement in sound from the TV speakers is remarkable - definitely Bose quality in a small package.  Obviously the sound quality from this soundbar does not compare to a surround sound system or even a larger soundbar.  This soundbar has better base quality when it sits away from the wall a little, but there is a built in adjustment for wall mounted applications that does a good job of rebalancing the sound.  We had some space limitations both in terms of length and depth of the bar.  This was a perfect solution for what we were looking for and the sound quality is much better than some of the other soundbars we tried.  Additionally, hooking up your phone or other Bluetooth enabled device to play music is very easy.  We use this device exclusively now to play music in our bedroom.  The remote is a bit big, but it is chock full of features.  We have the soundbar connected to a smart TV with an Apple TV connected as well.  The included remote is able to control all of the functions of the TV, the soundbar, and the Apple TV without selecting different devices.  Press one button and the TV, soundbar, and Apple TV all power on or off, and as far as we can tell all functions of each of the devices can be controlled by the remote without much setup effort.  Definitely recommend this soundbar.",5,1,2019-4-29,1,3,0
"I purchased this soundbar because I have a hard time hearing dialogue while watching TV.  This soundbar advertised a special dialogue mode to enhance the voice level.  It does a good job boosting voice levels, but it falls very short in other parts of broadcast audio.  I have a Sony CT370 soundbar to compare with.  Voice clarity with the Bose soundbar was slightly better than the enhanced voice setting for the Sony.  Special effects, sound effects and music on broadcasts on the Bose was very flat compared to the Sony.  Also, if you like to listen to music via your DVD player or Bluetooth device, the Bose will be a disappointment.  Frequencies are flat.  Music played on my Sony was exponentially better.  The fact that the Sony comes with a subwoffer contributes to it's better sound quality.  I agree that the Bose soundbar is an improvement over a TV's built-in speakers, but it falls well short of other comparably priced soundbars on the market like the Sony CT370.",2,1,2019-10-9,1,3,0
"I have always loved Bose products for their great sound quality. That is no exception here. The sound is such a wonderful improvement that my 42"" tv feels small. Having said that, Bose is stuck in a time machine with their HUGE remote and their very mediocre app landscape. In fact, there is no app from Bose that controls the Solo 5. The very fact that I now need a HUGE remote on my coffee table to do exactly one thing - control the volume and mute - is annoying. Again, quality and value are great(!), but the other shortcomings are too disappointing. Lastly, did I mention how HUGE the remote is? It's HUGE. Like 1980's HUGE.",3,1,2020-3-29,1,4,0

"This is a good Bose soundbar that will meet the needs of many casual TV users who are just wishing for a better sound experience during television watching without resorting to the incredibly large and expensive sound systems out there. The unit comes as a single piece that is connected with only one wire to the TV (either an optical cable, provided, or a traditional RGB cable) and, of course, a power cord. The unit is self-amplified, and after setting up the remote (which is not as daunting as some others, but may take some extended interaction to get it the way it needs to be for full operation of all your components -- this is a universal remote, so it can control all your equipment, not just the soundbar itself).The hallmark description of the sound produced by this bar is what I would call ""clear."" It's not going to pour out pounding bass as it does not have either the large speakers or amplifier necessary for such, but it does give a very well-rounded soundstage for TV watching, and actually does occasionally reveal some surprising levels of bass you would not think possible. (You can also adjust the amount of base using the remote, too, although I would call this lower-mid-range, rather than bass.) If you are used to listening to the small, tiny speaker built into all flat TVs, you'll both be impressed at the different and also need a little time to adjust to the difference in sound. As with all speakers, placement is a key factor, so you can experiment exactly where to physically locate the speaker: wall mount, in front of the TV itself, behind the TV, lower, or higher. It feels and sounds like a quality device with the trademark Bose ""feel"" to it. There is also another setting on the remote that allows you to set an extra clarity level for spoken words, something that is really helpful for certain shows, particularly older TV shows.",4,1,2019-12-22,1,2,0
"I've only had it for a matter of a week, but it's great.I live in a small apartment and in order to watch some movies (in particular ""scary movies"") I'd have to constantly be on volume control quickly turning up the volume for dialog, and the volume down for the stupid loud music scenes.

"I searched around Amazon and the internet for a one speaker (with no separate bass or satellite speakers) system that we could use in our living room. My wife gave me very CLEAR orders about having something that would fit into our entertainment center without being an eye sore while still sounding good enough to watch tv shows or movies. Well, now that she has pretty much told me that I might be sleeping with the dog, and trust me the dog doesn't like it either! Anyway, I watched youtube videos on the Bose system and the competitors. I chose the Bose Solo 5, praying that I didn't need to buy a larger dog bed too. This speaker is great! It has good bass but not overpowering the spoken words or the sound effects in whatever we are watching. WHEW! It has a well rounded sound, and can get loud enough that we can find the right volume for whatever we are watching! I haven't yet needed to max out the volume yet, except to drown out the wife's voice!!! I have other Bose speakers and have been satisfied with the quality of their products. Luckily for Bose, I didn't need to buy bandages, because, if I am honest, the dog and the wife both bite! So great job Bose! Don't get me the wrong, I still can't sleep in the bed, but at least I am in the a/c!! I am very satisfied with the Bose Solo 5! I just wished Bose made replacement wives?? (I am not concerned, because the wife won't read this! :)The universal remote that comes with this system is so good, that we have it as our primary remote for the living room. It controls that sat box, the tv, and the Bose speaker. I love that remote. The instructions were clear and replaced the tv and sat remote. Nearly worth the buy for the remote. So we are very satisfied with the remote too. Easy to hook up and setup. Great!",5,1,2017-5-30,1,8,0
"I am having a very hard time writing this review because the Bose sound bar is perfect for what it is, but I'm not sure that a sound bar is what I wanted to buy. The sound is very crisp and precise - a piano sonata, for example, sounds flawless - speech (especially with dialog mode selected) is very clear and easy to listen to. The volume fills (but does not overpower) a large room. The problem is that I was hoping for at least a small scale version of home theater experience, and this is definitely not that - and I doubt that any sound bar is. There is not even a hint of floor-thumping sub-bass. Set-up was super-easy - both the optical cable to my TV and Bluetooth to my iPhone. A couple other minor negatives are that the optical cable is relatively short and I may need to buy a longer one to get flexibility in positioning the bar, and that there is no output available to add-on a subwoofer if I wanted to do that. I chose this product because of the respected Bose name, and because I have owned several wonderful Bose products over the years. The challenge of choosing a sound bar is made much harder by the huge number of fake 5-star reviews of sound bars - especially Chinese products. Before buying this Bose I bought a $90 Chinese unit with many 5-star reviews that was just junk (and returned it).",5,1,2018-4-30,1,3,0
"I have been having more difficulty understanding the dialogue in TV shows and movies lately... I am getting older and yes, I did listen to loud music in the 70's.  I have tried a couple of different solutions like a bluetooth transmitter & headphones, which worked ok but I don't like to have the headphones on for long and it has to be kind of loud for me, and with a different sound bar which really didn't help much over the TV's own speakers.  So I ordered this Bose Solo 5 system since it mentioned improving the clarity of dialogue.  Well I have to say that it does.  It first turns on in a ""standard"" mode and sounds pretty ""regular"" in that mode; really no big difference between it and my prior sound bar.  But once you press the ""dialogue"" button on the remote, you can definitely hear a difference in clarity.  I was pretty skeptical, but it really does help me understand much better what people are saying.  It is an obvious improvement.  I am adding a photo of the button on the remote you need to push to enable the dialogue mode since it wasn't obvious to me.  When the dialogue mode is on, the green status light on the sound bar changes in color to amber, but you will be able to hear the difference, or at least I could.  I should mention that some of the bass seems to be reduced when in dialogue mode but it also seems to me the voice frequencies are enhanced and not just pumping up the treble.  I gladly give up some of the bass for the clarity.  You can always just press the dialogue button a second time to toggle back to the regular sound settings if you prefer.  Truthfully, I thought I would send this system back if it did not make a big difference since it is a bit pricey, and I am definitely not sending this back.You know how some people get stuff free to review?  Well, I wish I got this for free, but didn't.  I paid the full price.  Just thought you might want to know.",5,1,2016-3-1,1,2,1
"After much fussing and confusion, we couldn’t get this to produce any sound.  A LONG hold to Bose customer service, which was also frustrating. They didn’t want to proceed without my address and phone number even though they already had my email. Eventually we figured out that the unit was defective so we sent it back.  The experience was so frustrating that we decided on a Yamaha, which was easy to set up, sounds great and cost less.",1,1,2018-8-17,1,3,0
"I wanted a compact soundbar to enhance the wimpy sound from my Sony Bravia HDTV (model KDL-40W650D), purchased in 2016. Because I live in an apartment and do not want to disturb my neighbors, I did NOT want a booming, surround-sound system with a sub-woofer. I also did NOT want a bunch of messy cables and speakers all over the room. I just wanted a decent soundbar that would enhance dialogue and make movies sound respectable...and this Bose Solo 5 TV Sound System does just that. I watched the 1959 classic movie Ben-Hur last night and the soundtrack sounded impressive! It was simple to connect to my Sony Bravia HDTV with the included optical digital audio cable. I checked the online manual for my TV model to make sure it had the correct output - see my photo of the optical digital audio output on my Sony Bravia HDTV. If your TV does not have an optical digital audio output, there are other setup options, but you will have to buy your own cable. You turn off the speakers on your TV and then control the speaker volume using the included Bose remote. You can also enhance the dialogue by pressing the dialogue button on the included Bose remote. I already owned a Bose Soundlink Mini ii bluetooth speaker for my phone and laptop, which I love. So I thought I would buy another Bose product. Bose is expensive, but excellent sound quality. Just what I wanted!",5,1,2017-4-8,1,6,1

"Setup was super easy, the remote works great, and the sound quality is awesome!  We have Vizio tv, and the built in speakers suck!  As a Bluetooth speaker, it supplies great sound for background music when the tv is off as well. Yes, it is not a ""bangin'"" system for throwing raging house parties, nor is it a full ""home theatre surround"" system, but it is an awesome upgrade over the stock tv speakers.  Voices are much more clear with the Bose speaker over the stock speakers as well.  If you are looking for a high quality upgrade for your tv room, get this!  It is compact, easy to set up, sounds great, and a great value for high quality speaker.",5,1,2017-8-26,1,2,1
"Update: 9/4/19: Here's what I learned, since I'm not much of an instruction reader: You have to put your TV on mute to get the best sound from the sound bar. I skipped over that particular point, but since I figured that out, I have grown to love this sound bar. It has great audio, great bass, the tinniness is gone, since I don't have sound coming out of both my TV and the sound bar. Solid purchase, and I'm upping my rating to a five.I live in a small apartment, so I wanted something that would enhance the sound of my new TV without ticking off my neighbors. This sound bar does the trick on may levels.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,7,1

But I expected so much more of a Bose in terms of sound quality.  Dialog clarity is improved, but the the overall sound is flat compared to the TV speakers on their own.  I had previously paired my Bose Mini Sound Link speaker with the TV and it blows this soundbar away in every category.  Checking to see if I can return as it's not defective - it's just not worth the money.",3,1,2018-11-26,1,5,0

"The soundbar is actually a great improvement over the TV's speakers. Nice volume, nice bass, but the problem is that I cannot get the soundbar to work via any of the TV HDMI ports.  This may actually be a restriction of my television and not the soundbar, which is a seven year old Sharp. I had to connect the soundbar thru the optical connection on my satellite box.  So disappointed since I wanted to use the soundbar mostly with my Roku device, which is HDMI connected.  I purchased an RCA cable, which the install guide indicates can be used with the AUX connection on the soundbar, but unfortunately that did not work either.  I was easily able to program the remote to work with both the TV and satellite box, so only having to hit one power button on the remote to turn off/on both the TV and satellite box is nice, but, occasionally the remote will NOT turn on the soundbar, but only the TV and satellite box, which is really inconvenient.",2,1,2018-12-4,1,5,0
"When see you're buying Bose and the $200 price, you automatically think you're going to get a crystal clear, high quality sound from this soundbar.

Yes, I am connecting the TV to the Bose Soundbar using the optical cable. So disappointing.",1,1,2020-5-12,1,3,0
This is a very solid product made by Bose.Their reputation held up with this less expensive speaker. Most of their speakers are easily a few hundred $$ and I just don't have that kind of money to spend at the moment since I am in college.,5,1,2020-7-3,1,3,0
"I love Bose headphones and I do own several of them. But, creating that sound in the living room must be much harder. At $200, you can get a great pair of headphones, but not a great home theater speakers. Solo 5 makes a compromise to focus on clarity in mid-high range. Bass is out the window, though. The speakers are in the center of the bar and produces a quite narrow sound stage. I think it's for a smaller TV (under 45"") in a small room (like a den). I've compared it to Yamaha YAS-108, similarly priced with good reviews. I still prefer Solo 5, though. Yamaha does have a better left-right separation and bass production, but sounds lopsided in the mid-high range (especially in music -- Josh Groban sounds under the weather). Sole 5 produces more balanced sound (albeit losing low-end). So, for musical/music lovers, I recommend Solo 5 over other similarly priced sound bars. I'm upgrading from Vizio 3.1ch sound bar w/ subwoofer. I do lose pounding bass, but dialogs and vocals sound much more clear.",4,1,2019-1-5,1,5,0

If your trying to improve sound quality for movie watching this is no the right choice. Look for a sound bar that has a minimum of 3 channels (speakers) in it. This one is only (2). You need a 3 channel to give you the audible sound you need and so you don’t have to turn up the volume too much to hear properly. You will notice quite a price increase when looking at 3 channel sound bars but it will give you what you need.,3,1,2019-3-27,1,1,0
"I bought this because I had serious difficulty making out speech on a lot of films and television; it sounded like everybody was whispering half the time. The good news is that it does help significantly in that regard as promised. An unexpected bonus was how much meatier things sound compared to normal flatscreen speakers, the gunshots in games have a definite force to them and more traditional content is much richer.The bad news is just how expensive the bar is considering what you get. I understand that Bose is a trustworthy brand with a price to match but I feel that if it cost $50 less then it would be much easier to recommend.",3,1,2017-9-18,1,1,0
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2020 NOT! I can’t believe that this product broke on New Year’s eve 2019. I got it only on Christmas 2019  so the product isn’t even 7 days old and it is broken. It broke so thoroughly that it was useless on a most important day to begin 2020. No Bose sound for the Rose Parade  or Rose Bowl. and the failure is so ridiculous. It is the little plastic hinged door (why is this hinged door even there?) that broke when trying to insert the optical cable therefore the sound bar is useless. The tiny delicate plastic piece (the size of a pinky finger nail) got stuck midway and obstructed the connecting port so could not connect optical cable at all. Have to return the sound bar and I am very doubtful replacing this product. The little plastic hinged door is extremely delicate and ruins the whole sound experience (like NO sound) if it breaks. Can’t believe this little tiny insignificant flawed design can ruin the entire Bose experience!,1,1,2020-1-1,1,6,0

"Initially, I as fairly satisfied with this Bose sound bar. The sound wasn't anything to write home about, but for the money it was acceptable. HOWEVER. A few months into owning/using this Bose sound bar an unusual problem started: When the TV is turned on and I then turn on the sound bar and turn up the volume, no sound is produced. BUT, if I turn the sound bar on and push the increase volume button...and then turn the sound bar off and on again and press the volume button, sound is produced.

Today there are other brands available at lower prices offering what I consider comparable or even superior sound.This isn't like other Bose units you know and love from a couple decades ago.  It's the ""TV"" model.  In this case, means Bass isn't as rich.  Treble isn't as pure.  Mid-range can be muddled.

"I live in an apartment and wanted to be respectful of my neighbors. The sound from my tv was okay, but got loud and bass heavy during non speaking parts. I needed something that I could listen to and enjoy at a decent volume at all hours. This little sound bar does the trick! The dialogue mode is fantastic as I get crisp vocals so I can hear exactly what is being said. If I want to listen to my music while doing chores I can use Bluetooth and sync up my phone and select the “bass” function on the remote (which is universal and bridged the gap to all of my remotes) to get a more enjoyable music experience.It works exactly what I wanted it for and was at an affordable price for a luxury brand like Bose. I can’t give it five stars because I’ve only had it for a short time and there is no volume meter to see exactly what I have the volume set at. It’s a small nitpick and I am sure I will be fine with it, but it is something Bose should be aware of.",4,1,2018-8-26,1,1,0
"I’m usually WOWed by anything with the BOSE name, but not by this. I guess I expected more than mediocre but for a low price. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not BAD... but for $200, the bother of an additional remote and extra wires, I expected something better than what my internal tv speakers already delivered me. If your TV has decent internal speakers, THIS is not going to make you happy that you spent additional money. If your TV’s speakers are really weak or tinny, this will give you decent sound... just decent. The remote is huge and, as far as I can tell, a MUST to turn on/off and control the volume of the unit. I almost never send things back, but this might be one purchase that makes me decide to go to the effort of repacking and sending it back.Save your money...",3,1,2019-5-16,1,3,0

When you are streaming video you can down swipe and select the Bose as your audio. I wanted to improve voice clarity and still had to use the Bose remote to push the word bubble button but once it was set up I could power on and off the Apple TV system and the Bose picked up where it left off.

This product is well below the Bose standard and very disappointing. Avoid!",2,1,2017-8-8,1,1,0
"I am having a hard time giving this 5 stars. I wish there was a way to see what level of volume the speaker is at when playing through the TV.

I got it for the size and it fits perfectly under my TV.",4,1,2018-6-4,1,5,0
"This speaker is adequate for watching movies and TV shows, but if you are listening to music it is sub par....especially if you are not sitting directly in front of the TV.  I think a $100-$150 soundbar with sub would provide a better experience for the price.  However, this unit is small, only has two TINY speakers in it, and manages to throw decent sounding bass to anyone sitting directly in front of it.  This isn't rattle your seat bass, but is rather good sounding.  I live in an apartment where bass travel is of concern for my neighbors, so the small package in combination with this means I'll keep it.  I am struggling with having paid $200 for it, but I already threw out the box and can't exchange it.

"I purchased this Bose Solo 5 TV Sound Bar for my wife for Christmas.  She has been complaining that she cannot hear all of what is said on the programs that we watch.  She also has ear phones that she can wear, but they are big and not fun to wear for several hours although they help.  After we finally got the sound bar fixed up to the tv, we watched a program which she had been having problems hearing all the dialog, well, for the first time in a long time she heard every word and the sound was perfect.  She could not believe that the sound bar could clear up her hearing problems, she loves it and has been enjoying tv for the first time in several months without wearing headphones.  She does not know why I did not get one before!  Well I just happened to see it on the Amazon Christmas adds, so I thought it would be a good Christmas Present.

If you do, this Bose system will make your life better. It's easy to install, and the sound quality is amazing. As someone who grew up with massive speakers, e.g., 15"" to get good bass, I continue to be impressed with the low end quality of modern speakers, and this Bose is no exception. Its sleek design fits easily in front of the TV, and it comes with a remote that can be programmed to work the TV as well as the Bose box, even if you have a TiVo or (presumably) another intermediate unit in the loop.

"I had wanted to upgrade our family room TV to a soundbar for years. I was seeking something that was smaller but could still deliver some bass, but I didn't want to have to deal with a subwoofer. I researched a ton! At first I looked at the Roku Soundbar, but I realized that wouldn't work if I wanted to have great sound while watching DVDs -- and that soundbar was huge! It would take up my entire TV entertainment center. Then I looked at a compact Polk audio system. Well, my TV does not have an HDMI-ARC input - only HDMI. I have Bose computer speakers that I love and enjoyed a Bose speaker for an old school iPod about 10 years ago. I trusted the brand so I did some more delving into what they had to offer. I ended up going with this Bose 5 system over their Bose TV Speaker because of the promise of the bass; reviews of the Bose TV speaker said that system was more for enhancing dialogue clarity (and it was ~$80 more). The Bose 5 delivers!  It took only a few minutes to set up; I use the optical cable. Make sure you completely follow the instructions when programming the remote. When I first programmed it, I got it to sync to the settings but didn't do the last step to finalize it, so the sound would go in and out. Once I realized my mistake and went back through programming the remote, I haven't encountered any issues. You can program the universal remote to work with your cable, which I did, but I chose not to sync the power on/off of the Bose remote with that of cable, because I don't always want to use the Bose speakers when watching TV, especially early in the morning when I'm the first one up. Turning the system on and off is super easy -- even my elderly parent can manage it. And boy does the bass deliver!  It's so nice to watch some movies at home and have a semi-movie theater experience. And syncing to my phone through Bluetooth was a snap. I will say I've had to play with the sound settings. Once I realized that my TV's speakers stay on even when I turn the Bose on, I've learned to turn the TV speakers down a bit (but not muted) and the Bose speaker up for the best quality output and to not get a weird echo, which is particularly noticeable with news. I highly recommend this system for its size, quality of sound, and ease of use!",5,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0

Imagine in a company with a prestigious name sent some outdated accessory with their product. Like if BMW sent a physical key, with no fob, in 2020. And after a week, it stopped turning the car on.

"I've always liked the Bose brand and the sound it reproduces.  Let me explain that I am a musician and have a great deal of experience with sound design and audio production.  Too many speakers or sound designs are made to enhance the bass end of the sound envelope, especially to enhance the sound of an impact.  I wanted a speaker that would add to the depth of the sound for our television without adding too much bass.  Most people think they need a sub-woofer when, in fact, a speaker like this is perfect for their needs.  I bought this because it did not have a sub-woofer and it is perfect!!  It still offers great sound quality without too much deep bass from poor sound design of television shows and films.  And you can always turn that bass up or down.  I've waited a long time to get a decent speaker because I wanted control over the bass, with a good range and depth of sound color, and the added bonus that people's speaking is very distinct.

"After installing a new  Toshiba flatscreen TV, we especially enjoyed watching British and similar foreign movies. The operative word was “watch”... I simply don’t believe people who watch such movies and TV productions and claim to understand what the actors SAY. This difficulty is indicative of new program production and director accommodation of colloquial accents, styles and tonal expression! You are not deaf; Mrs. Marple mumbles, Vera drops into near Geordie mode, Wallender is reflective under his breath, Midsummer characters express truly diverse British vernaculars... and Hercule? well, it’s not French but it is engaging. We want to HEAR what they have to say!!! BOSE provides access in a quality, well designed, overly simple sound bar with a button that immediately renders speech clear and more than understandable.  The remote can be a patience tester, but this is one “worth its cost” device... we are quite pleased! Well packed, quick delivery and simple instructions... and it delivers!",5,1,2019-3-1,1,2,0

Sound quality is good, not great, but slightly better than the TV, especially the  bass. The Voice button works better on some shows than others, but can be useful. The bluetooth has worked well with our Samsung phones and tablets for background music. Remote is large but works well, except cannot be used with Amazon Prime, there is no ""back"" button, so we use 3 remotes.Overall it is a good speaker, but not worth the price.

Also, we do not have cable but stream using a Firestick and the universal remote does not work with that so we do still have two remotes.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,2,0
"I can't tell you how happy I am I bought this soundbar, It's a perfect fit for my apartment, the sound is crisp, clean and clear. There are adjustments for increasing the richness of the bass which is an added plus. There is one thing I don't like about it, there no indicator of how much volume you're adding or taking, you have to adjust the sound up and down listening for volume changes.",5,1,2018-8-11,1,4,0
"Sound quality only deserves 1 star but I added an extra star since I did like the remote.I have a small bose bluetooth speaker for my kitchen that I love, so I expected this bose soundbar to sound good as well.  It doesn't.  It sounds very tinny to me no matter how much I fiddled with the settings.  This was used in my smallish bedroom and connected using the included optical cable.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,2,0
"Pro: It really improves sound quality, especially when using the dialogue function. No more turning up the volume trying to hear what is said in a movie.Con: Unless you want to keep two remotes around, you have to use the included  universal remote. It takes four (!) buttons in a particular order to turn the cable, TV, and soundbar on. On the bright side, no one will ever be able to watch your TV without detailed instructions.",4,1,2019-1-27,1,4,0
"I had it for about a month and it just stopped working, my return window closed on July 30th sadly so I’m stuck with a speaker that chooses when to work. It was a nice grab for the price and was okay for the moment but it was not tough  enough when using bass. Feels like the louder it is the more wear it causes and faster. It rattles a little after one time my little cousin played her music. Bass only goes so far as is, so It wasn’t great for surround in movies. Overall bummed I didn’t have it long at all. So I’m out over $100. All the buttons light up but no sound. My wallet is hurting lol and to top it off my tv speakers decided to stop working like what the (i never use them.) So I’m stuck with a mute tv and speaker I’m so miserable!",3,1,2020-8-9,1,3,0
Nice sound and small size. Remote is monstrous and clunky! Designed to supposedly run all your devices but I paired it to my LG smart TV and it only controls a modest number of TV functions. Net result is you have to keep the TV remote out as well as this monstrous one. I have another Bose sound bar that I recently purchased and it came with a tiny and very functional remote. They missed the mark with this one!,4,1,2019-4-10,1,3,0
Sounds great for the smaller extra room. Voices are clear. Love the big remote. Very nice slim size. It only took 3 minutes to hook up. All automatic with one fiber optic.,5,1,2017-3-17,1,1,0
"Got it on sale and for that can't complain. The bass is good for just a soundbar, and the speech mode (is that what they're calling it?) is nice when there's background noise and you want the voices to cut above everything else. The remote is bulky, though good since you can manage your TV and other devices with it too. Bluetooth connectivity is as easy as you would hope. I'm sure there are better (and more expensive) soundbars out there, but this one is adequate for me and a tremendous leap in quality over TV speakers.",5,1,2019-5-11,1,2,0
"This sound bar had excellent sound quality, but did not perform as we needed it to.  My spouse and I have problems hearing dialogue over the loud background music and sound affects on movies and TV shows.  We thought this sound bar might be the answer as it has a  button that is specifically designed to emphasize the dialogue.  However, the background noises were still so loud that the dialogue did not clearly come through. The bass was particularly annoying.  If some enterprising individual could solve the problem of the background noises on such programs, they would make millions.  Work on it, people !!!",1,1,2019-11-2,1,3,0
"I tried a cheaper model first.  Wow, what a disappointment.  It was returned and a Bose was picked, again.  I had a pedestal mount Bose sound bar that was 5+ years old and after a recent Bose service upgrade it finally would not power up anymore.I thought I'd try a different brand, since soundbars have come a long way since that model and the cheaper price was more attractive.  Wrong, the tin sound, lack of bass and high echo definitely was not what I was used to.  Tough to pair to my cable remote and other irritations in the set up suggested I try Bose again.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Really thought this would do the trick for my very small room and although it did add some depth, the overall volume was not what I expected. My television volume was higher than this system. I just don't see how a soundbar created to improve sound could be quieter than the TV it is supposed to enhance. I have Bose Bluetooth speakers and Bose computer speakers and this is a real disappointment from Bose. Will be returning item.",1,1,2016-6-26,1,5,0
"I have wanted to own a Bose product since I was a kid and I thought that the sound bar would be perfect for our newly mounted tv AND to play music via bluetooth from our iphones. The TV connection (hardwired) is great and the sound is fantastic, but the bluetooth link is horrible. I dont know if its only my sound bar or if all of them have these issues. I have tried Pandora, youtube and linked it to other iphones, but the connection gets choppy regardless if the phone is 10 ft away or 1 ft away. Somedays its fine, but most of the time, the music starts cutting up. Sucks.",2,1,2017-9-7,1,6,0
"I just received the Bose Solo 5 soundbar.  The set up was very easy once the correct connection was established.  My TV is a Sony Bravia circa 2008 and has an Optical output port (recommended) however i was not able to get sound to play thru the soundbar with this connection (also the only one provided).  A lengthy phone call to Bose customer service during which i was disconnected was not helpful.  I purchased audio output and connected to the soundbar successfully.  The sound is a big improvement as i listen to alot of music either thru the tv or my phone and the dialogue option on the soundbar is obvious. Please know that each time you use the soundbar your settings have to be redone  ie  bass, volume etc.  Also for information, my tv has to have the volume turned completely down to hear only the soundbar.",4,1,2019-7-18,1,3,0
"bought this to go with my new TV (SAMSUNG 55 Frame).  Sounds good.  Not obtrusive.  Unfortunately, the only thing the Samsung remote can control is the volume.  To turn it on/off, switch to dialog mode, bluetooth, etc... you need to use the Bose remote.  You can, apparently, program the Bose remote to run the TV, but it is one of those remotes you need to take a class to use...looks like you could pilot the space shuttle with this thing.  Samsung has been going with the minimalist approach (like the Apple TV remote) and I much prefer that.  My wife is a bit of a Luddite and it makes me tired to even think about teaching her to use this thing.  I think I am going to have to send this back",3,1,2019-6-23,1,3,0
"This is a solid soundbar but for the price and the brand being synonymous with exceptional sound quality I am disappointed. I got this today and connected it to my TV using the included digital audio optical cable. I played around with the bass and dialogue buttons while watching The Greatest Showman. I can max out the sound with no distortion; however, I was completely underwhelmed. I expected the bass to thump more and the overall sound quality to be crisper. Additionally, I assumed maxing out the volume would be too loud for comfort but it wasn't. I'm not sure I wouldn't have been just as happy with a lesser known brand for less money. I just expected more from Bose.",3,1,2018-12-28,1,2,0
"Bought this Bose sound bar to give my Roku TV a sound boost.  The sound bar works great with the TV as well as my DVD player and iPod.  It generates enough sound, although I question as to whether I should've gotten the larger Bose sound bar.  But I like how this sound bar is shorter than my Roku TV (which is 38"" in length) and I can plug up to 4 devices to the sound bar input plugs in the back of the sound bar. I went from having 8 speakers hooked up to a stereo receiver to simplifying the configuration with one sound bar. Pleased with my sound bar purchase.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,2,0
"I bought this Bose sound bar because I have always liked Bose products.  Any of the flat screen TVs I own have the speakers in the back and the sound is not good in terms of quality and having to turn it up almost to the max to hear certain shows (and I do not have hearing issues).  The sound bar definitely enhances the volume of my flat screen LG tv and has a good full sound. The only issue I see is that when I play my DVD/Blue ray player with it, the voices don't match up to the people talking, its approximately a second behind which is weird watching lips moving not in sync with the sound.",5,1,2019-3-24,1,3,0
"I'm 72, and normally have closed captions on for movies and TV shows, which younger friends and guests find distracting (at best).  My primary problem is the soundtrack drowning out the dialogue.  Last night, after testing the soundbar with two movies (La La Land and Thor Ragnarok) and two TV shows (The Voice and Bones), I'm happy to report that the soundbar pretty much eliminated the need for me to use closed captions.",4,1,2018-11-23,1,4,0
"Not up to Bose standard of sound.  Looks nice, but sounds quite tinny, very little low end.  I was not expecting theater surround sound quality, but after having owned a number of Bose items this is a disappointment.  In fact it is going back to Amazon, have replaced it with another Yamaha unit at 1/3 the price that sounds three times better.",2,1,2018-6-6,1,7,0
"The sound bar has performed wonderfully from the moment we plugged it in. setup with the optical cable was straight forward following the directions and is way better than the tinny speakers of our smart tv. We are able to control all of our optical devices with the Bose remote and the instruction manual comes with all the codes for just about every conceivable device you hook to a TV. The sound quality is crisp, clear, and can get pretty darn loud if you want, with no audible distortion.  Since my wife and I are not audiophiles, we chose not to go with the Bose surround system, just the regular sound bar. The nice thing is that my wife can use her smart phone to attach using Bluetooth to listen to Christmas music she is streaming from her phone. Now that is convenient!  For the price I think it cant be beat. I have seen many sound bars that are cheaper from Sony, and Viseo but I have had Bose products in that past and enjoyed their quality and workmanship. The soundbar is small and has a small footprint, but the sound quality makes it seem much larger. So far, we have thoroughly enjoyed this speaker.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"This bar has no HDMI-ARC connector, therefore you are solidly locked in to using multiple remotes if you want digital audio, as digital audio cannot be controlled using the TV remote. You can, however, use the aux input for analog audio  - IF - and only IF - your TV has analog outputs. Even doing that, the Solo 5 will not remember it's own volume settings if they are below 20% or above 80%. In my case, I'm forced to use the analog setup as new TV's have way more options than the Bose remote can handle. The Solo 5 sounds ""OK"" when it's volume is set to 100%. Then the TV remote can modulate volume to around 60% on the on-screen slider. Mute works too. However, the Bose defaults to 80%, so I have to start over with the Bose remote every time I turn on the TV to get it's sound level back up. It's as if this bar was made specifically  for 1980's TVs!",2,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0
"No stars on the peripheral line items as it didn't work right out of the box. Plugged in the optical & powered up, made sure TV audio set to external and then: nothing. Not even a crackle. Spent a few minutes troubleshooting but frankly a sound bar works or not - I've setup 2 more in the house and they simply work without needing to call a support line, etc. I think I prefer my Toshiba bar anyway so I'll likely get another for this TV. Just thought I'd take advantage of the price & good reviews for the Bose. But not functional from the box is pretty disenchanting from ever buying another.",1,1,2020-1-26,1,2,0
"I wanted to like this product. I really like Bose quality and have other Bose products. But Bose is hit and miss on a lot of things, and this is no exception. First, it supports optical input in lieu of HDMI. Why? I have optical from the new Samsung TV, but if I use it, I cannot adjust the volume with the TV remote. That would not be true if there was an HDMI output, but there is not. The new TV has an AWESOME all-in-one remote that is very well paired with the TV functionality. The Bose system ignores all of that and wants to be the only remote, but it's nowhere near capable of this. I liked the dialog setting, which is why I bought the unit, and it worked. But it's not worth having to use two remotes or giving in to the Bose borg. Also, as a speaker, I could never get this to pair with the TV, and my TV has no headphone jack. I'm returning this for something that supports Bluetooth or HDMI output.",3,1,2019-8-8,1,1,0
"The UPS guy delivered this to the wrong address, but once I found it at my neighbor's house, all was well.  I just plugged in the power, the optical audio cable and then it was up and running.  The sound bar didn't need me to cycle through the inputs to find it.Setting up the universal remote control was a breeze.  Just press the thing you're setting up until all devices light up on the remote, type the four digit code for your device and press the + button on the volume and it's set up.  It was super easy to set up.  Sound is great.  Much better than the sound from the Samsung TV my wife and I got for our bedroom.",5,1,2018-11-26,1,2,0
I’ve been searching for a good soundbar that not only had good sound for music but one I could watch TV or a movie and hear and understand the words. My old soundbar made it very difficult to hear the dialogue. The reviews were good on this one and many people mentioned the dialogue issue I was having. Well I can attest to this being fantastic and exactly what I have been looking for. The tone is rich and deep and music sounds great but TV and movies are watchable again! Not only that but it came with everything you need to hook it up and set up was done in 5 minutes. Very easy and looks great in front of my TV. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality soundbar at a very reasonable price.,5,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
"I am a bit disappointed on this speaker on few points.First is the sound quality. While the sound quality is in an acceptable range, it also lacks on bass and tremble effect compare to my previous Bose speaker. However, it is acceptable if you live in an apartment or dorm.",3,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0
It’s Bose what can I even say? Easy as heck to hook up to my smart tv using the supplied optical cable and bought a cheap wall mount bracket setup here on amazon for $10. Had this hooked up in under ten minutes.Onto the sound quality:,5,1,2020-6-20,1,1,0
I can't say enough about this product.  It's got the typical Bose quality but what makes it great is 1) the sound is perfect - meaning no sub woofer is necessary and 2) the wall mount bracket (sold separately) makes for a super clean looking installation.  It integrated quickly with my Fire Stick (once I told it to output in Dolby Digital).  The fancy multi remote it comes with is nice but not required.  The Fire Stick remote works just fine.  If you're on the fence and hate looking at wires... this is the one for you.  Just remember the wall mount does NOT come with it.  It's a separate part.,5,1,2020-5-16,1,1,0
"The soundbar is overall just fine although I was expecting more. That’s partly my own fault for going by their exceptional reputation and, let’s face it, being too lazy to spend much time researching and comparing against other products.It’s affordable and nice to look at. The design is excellent, in my opinion, and the sound is very good. I expected exceptional sound, not merely very good. Perhaps my ears aren’t what they used to be?",3,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Installed this last night on a 65” Samsung. Tv is mounted to the wall. Purchased after market universal kit to mount under tv. Sound is amazing for such a small unit. Of course Bose holds it reputation. One thing I’m not impressed with, the universal remote the sound bar comes with is 10 times larger then my tv remote. Sadly I have to use the brick remote just to turn the coins bar on. :/. Oh, one more miffed thing that made be cranky is the fact that Amazon suggests buying a optical cable at check out. Of course I should have read what was included with the sound bar and you guessed it, it comes with an optical cable. The optical cable is a smaller diameter cable then the Amazon optical cable but opted to use what cane with the Bose. Hope this helped.",4,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"I had another brand of sound bar that had two HDMI sockets.  It had too many settings and I had Cable, DVD and Roku devices.  One source always had to be left out.  Took it to Goodwill and bought this.  It could not be easier to set up.  Just plug into the optical sockets an power and you are ready to go.  The quality of Bose sound is a no-brainer--great from a small foot print.  An added bonus is syncing via Bluetooth and being able to play music from your phone.  All can basically controlled via the universal remote.  Don't forget to buy the wall mount kit, which is also an eay install.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,2,0
"Instantly improved my TV sound quality in a large open room (kitchen and living area). Very easy to setup, and the universal remote was easy to program and allowed me to stash all the other remotes (TV, cable, DVD) in a drawer.

"I'm a fan of Bose and am very satisfied with quality and performance of this Sound Bar.  My only reason for giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is due to the difference in performance between a coax connected input vs an optical input.  Unfortunately my TV in an RV doesn't have optical output, thus it's connected via coax.  It's necessary to turn TV volume to max with the coax input to have reasonable volume out of the Sound Bar.  I tried it in the house with an optical connection and the volume out of the Sound Bar was significantly greater.  But otherwise very satisfied.",4,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0
"I have trouble hearing the TV sometimes, and this sound system really does help when I use the special setting. In general it also helps to focus all the sound forward so my husband, who goes to bed early, isn’t blasted out by the sound coming from the rear of the tv. We are really pleased with the system and it’s sound. Would definitely recommend.",5,1,2018-5-17,1,6,0
"This speaker sounded too good to be true, and it was.  ""Simple plug and play""....yeah right.  After spending several hours over the course of 2 days talking to first Bose and then SONY (I have a SONY TV), I was basically just told that the devices aren't compatible.  I tried with both my SONY Bravia TVs (one much newer than the other) and neither would work.  If it works on your TV I'm sure it's great, but beware it may just simply not work or connect and you'll have to return it.",1,1,2020-1-23,1,2,0
"It's Bose right? You would think it would be great. It looks great. The quality feel is there. It pairs with your remote. But other than that, it is useless. I has muffled sound, even when the dialog mode is engaged. It has a base control but it is difficult to  set as it uses mysterious flashing lights that don't correlate to the changes in sound. The lack of good bass and treble controls (there are NO treble controls), the muffled sound and the very high price make this a no buyer. Do your research, buy something that works better than your TV speakers. This sound bar does not. It is fancy garbage.",1,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
"The one factor promised by Bose with this sound bar is that you can hear clean, crisp dialogue. Otherwise, the sound quality is nowhere near what I expected from Bose. Turned up fully, the bass and volume were still very low. A number of adjustments made on the TV and soundbar made no difference. In bluetooth mode, the volume was increased (yay!) however the setting would not stay as a default and I’d have to re-set it up again.The remote was bulky but I could connect 5 devices through it, taking a number of remotes off my coffee table.

When programming the tv, press the MENU button to test, not any other buttons. Once it works, you MUST press the EXIT button to save the setting.

"Stay away. First off. Purchased this as a gift for my Mom because my whole family thinks Bose is the best thing on the planet. So, I succumbed to taking a chance on this thinking it would be a nice gift and easier to use.Got everything plugged in five minutes flat. Ok. Let's give it a go. Nothing. No sound. Come to find out you can only have one source powered on at a time. Sounds dumb right...why would you want two on at the same time anyway. Logic. Turns out I have to have the Infinity cable box on at all times otherwise you have to go through a whole power up process which means rebooting. This only leaves you with an option to unplug a source and plug in another, say a BluRay player. Bose could have at least gave you the option to switch digital sources with the remote. Crippled from the start.",1,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"I wasn't sure what to expect in regards to a sound bar as opposed to a home theater system, but for the small room I use it in, it literally blew me away.  Bluetooth sounds great ( just like a ""stereo"" for all of us old-timers out there ).  Bluetooth easy to use as well.  The extra bass option is also a nice feature.  My ONLY gripe with this system is that the remote either has too many device codes to choose from (maybe it just happened to be the brand of my Blu-ray player that was the issue) to test to add your other ""pieces"" such as blu-ray player and/or cable box, or doesn't have the right device code at all.  My cable company wasn't listed, so I knew I wasn't gonna get the cable box to operate off the Bose remote, and my blu-ray player had nearly 30 device code choices, and still none of them would work with my remote.  The remote works fine for my TV and for Bluetooth.  But if you just wanna own a great product that you will be pleased with, I highly recommend the Bose Solo 5.",4,1,2018-11-6,1,4,0

"Its great not perfect, I'll explain, its not as loud as I wanted, its doesnt have the bass I expected, and its not intuitive as it does not turn itself on automatically when you turn on your tv, as other devices do.  I expected a bit more, but the price was right, it works, its  quality is okay, its not great, I own 3 other sound bars, one by LG another by yamaha, and I hate to say it, but both of those other sound bars are much louder, and have more bass sound, maybe I received a dud, but its very quiet, and also is never in sync with the tv, so you have to turn off the tv sound and use the soundbar by itself or you get the dreaded echos.  I purchased a new tv to go with this soundbar, and tried it with my other soundbars, it wasnt the tv.  So I can say this its great for kids, and young teens who really just above average sound above the tv sound itself, if your a studio enthusiast like I am and compose music and need that bass and extra htz ranges, this isnt for you, try something else.  So again I liked it, im not against it, I think its a bit below par, for what people would expect from a soundbar, the remote is nice and works very well, the remote is responsive, but doesnt have backlights so in a dark environment your not going to know what your pressing, though the sound is in normal placement as other remotes are, but lacks a few rich features like real surround 7.1 etc, its just above what a basic set of speakers for computers would come with back in the early 2000s when they made realtech soundbars and touch amps, which were never really popular.  :)  I again like the device I decided to keep it for the kids, not for studio audiophiles or the likes.",3,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"If you’re looking for a bass thumper to play rap or hip hop “music” and force your neighbors to “enjoy” it, too, this is not for you. However, if you want to listen to sane music reproduced at a reasonable volume with a wide dynamic balance OR you are an older person who just wants to understand the dialogue in tv shows and movies again, this sound bar does the job superbly! My wife and I tried a more expensive Samsung bar with woofer system first, but took it back after only one day. Our tv speakers sounded better. Saw an ad for this Bose bar and was intrigued by its “dialogue” setting (and it was $200 cheaper than the Samsung bar) so decided to give it a try. It sounds much better than our tv speakers. Even with the dialogue setting turned off, we can understand the speaking better, and with it on, the speech is MUCH easier to understand. I may buy another one for our other tv. Anyway, I highly recommend it.",5,1,2019-3-12,1,2,0
"Huge remote!! It’s too big and trying to pair it to the rest of my stuff is impossible. I just use it to turn it on and the volume. There should be an app for the remote. There are not buttons on the device, cool look but dumb idea. The sound is great when it’s all the way up. If you are relying on your tv for sound then this will be about 42 times better. It’s clear it has good base and it gets loud enough. There’s no indicator telling you where the volume is set at. I like to keep my volume at 70 or 75 so I just have to count how many times I press the button. It goes up to 100 and when you turn it on it starts at 50. I think the price should be more like $60.

Once I got it installed I was able to easily adjust the bass to my liking. We primarily use it for watching sports and DVD's.  The remote control that came with this system has everything.  It's taken us a while to get used to it.  The only thing I would recommend for the manufacturer is to make one that lights up. I have to turn on lights to see what I'm doing in the dark.  Installing diodes can't be that expensive other wise I would have given all 5 stars in all 3 categories.,4,1,2018-11-26,1,3,0
"I will be returning this item. The Bose is what you would expecct, and the price was good. But, for a techie to spend an entire afternoon trying to get the remote to connect to my Samsung OLED is more than my patience can bear. The directions were pretty simple (though they left out one step I found on YouTube). Trying to cycle through all the codes did not do the trick. Bose will start to lose customers if they allow shabby products like this universal remote to become associated with their quality.",2,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"We bought this soundbar because the stock TV speakers were rather tinny.  This does improve things, of course, but not as much as you might think.  Our other TV is hooked up to a full-on 5.1 audio system, and that sounds awesome.  This soundbar is just okay.  I really think $200 is way more than it's worth though.  We tried each of the three different types of inputs, and there's no discernable difference, so we ended up using the TV's headphone jack because that way you have volume control through the TV.  Nothing wrong with this soundbar; it works fine; I just think it's way overpriced.",3,1,2019-4-16,1,1,0
"Not super into audio so I am not the best person to rate it in terms of sound clarity and all that stuff.But if you're just looking for something that will give you that extra boost of sound to your TV, this soundbar is pretty good.

"The remote size is a little obnoxious, but my dog chewed it up one day so I bought a small replacement remote. Lol. The sound is great though!**update** after like a month and a half after getting this speaker it’ll randomly not work. It’ll turn on(there’s green light that’ll turn on when the speaker is on) but no sound will come out. Even after turning it off and back on again, unplugging it, and all of that stuff it just won’t work but a few days later it’ll be fine. It’ll randomly do that a lot now though. If it worked all the time then it’d be perfect.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
I tried to like this. The sound quality was clear. However I have a 55” TCL Roku tv it took forever to get the universal remote to link to my tv. The default 2231 code DID NOT work I had to go online and search until I found the code 2471. It worked! However I couldn’t get my directv linked. And when I swapped to my output with the PS4 and turned my volume up the volume wasn’t louder than my default speakers so I returned it.,3,1,2019-5-27,1,2,0

There is nothing wrong with this BOSE sandbar. It is just way too expensive for what else is out there nowadays. Back in 2015 or 2016 I’m sure this was the top of the line. But without a built in subwoofer and a very cruddy Bluetooth connection it’s just not worth $180 when there are so many other brands with subwoofers on the side or built-in and have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.,3,1,2020-8-17,1,2,0
"Might as well use the speaker on the tv. Very poor quality, especially for the money. There isn’t even a port to connect a woofer.  Guess you have to pay $500 to get quality from Bose.

The sound was OKAY... but when we lost the remote and had to switch back to the TV's speakers, I didn't really hear a huge difference.  What I liked about this was the ability to put the speaker in dialogue mode, which is where I DID hear a difference, and then, of course, for the Bluetooth functionality, allowing me to stream music and audiobooks easily.

"I'm starting to notice something with Bose products. It seems like all of them have just a little too much bass-- I have a set of PC speakers from them and this sound bar. My friend has a Bose Wave Radio. All of them, consistently, have too much bass for my liking. That's bad when you live in an apartment-- you'll be listening to something at a normal volume, but you're accidentally shaking your neighbor's wall!Fortunately, this one does have a limited degree of bass adjustability. The only problem is that if you turn the unit off, it ""forgets"" what you set the bass level too, so you're back to shaking the neighbor's wall until you set it back. But, that said, it still sounds good, has great clarity, and it's a good value.",4,1,2018-12-29,1,1,0
"Purchased this sound bar to use with an LG TV. The sound of the LG is not great but the sound bar definitely improved it. I had read a comment that someone made about this sound bar helping with audio transitions between movies and ads. Yes, this sound bar helps mitigate the up and down volume issue that was driving us crazy. The unit is a bit pricey (vista more than the TV) but it’s a Bose and definitely worth it! Oh—I purchased a better quality cable instead of using the one provided with the unit and that definitely helped.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,1,0
"I’d love to meet the ,genius’ who came up with the idea of this monstrous universal remote control. At least for this price they could have provided an additional small control with power, Bluetooth and audio buttons. The device doesn’t even listen on Bluetooth even though it’s powered by 110V. One has to turn in on and then push the Bluetooth button to connect to my phone.Bose knows how to do a better job. When I put on their headphones on, I don’t have to do anything. They automatically connect to nearby iPad and iPhone. When I chose Bose 5 on my iPhone, the speaker should turn on and connect.",2,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0

I had to hunt online to find the BOSE codes. But, once that was configured, all is well. Good sound quality for a stand-alone audio product, and good for apartment dwellers like me that are unable to drill hoels & run cable in walls for a ""true"" total surround sound system.BADS: Non-existent & very poor Customer Service.

"In terms of sound and quality, the Solo 5 sounds about it line with a roughly $200 device. Nothing that will blow your mind but certainly miles beyond what any factory TV system will deliver. It's also light and compact enough that it can be mounted above a TV, without looking awkward (as I've done). However, there is one thing that drives me absolutely nuts, and is the reason I'll probably be sending mine back. The ""universal"" remote simply does not offer complete functionality with smart TVs. Perhaps the most commonly used button on my Samsung smart TV remote is the ""back"" button - it ensures I don't have to completely exit the current app to return one menu screen. Despite years of complaints from customers, Bose appears to have decided this functionality (which is available on every $8 universal remote sold at CVS) is not important to owners. It drives me absolutely nuts, and guarantees you need to keep two remotes laying around.",3,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"I've used Bose speakers for years and have always been happy with their great sound quality. This small system is no exception. Though new, our TV's sound was frequently difficult to hear clearly.

All around a nice unit with clean Bose sound for an affordable price!",4,1,2019-6-3,1,2,0
"I would rate the sound quality higher but from time to time the audio starts breaking up.  Not sure if it's a heat thing or if the quality of the cable supplied with the unit is suspect.

"The sound quality off of this is FANTASTIC! For the price and for its size, we are extremely happy with it. The only complaint we have is the remote; it's very large and not easy to figure out its features. We connected it to our smart TV with no issue at all but the codes do not seem to work well, if at all, and I personally do not care for the fact that you cannot see the volume level. Other than the very large remote and it's features, or lack there of, I highly recommend this product. If you're looking for a quality sound bar for an amazing price, this is it.

"The bose sound bar is for my master bedroom.  I wanted a small but good sound.  The bose checked all the boxes for me.  It comes with the power cord and the audio cabke to hook up to your tv.  The sound quality is great, like other reviews had stated this sound bar is not intented for a big loud speaker system.  This bring out the softer tones and people speaking.  Before the sound bar i had a hard time hearing what the people would say so i would turn the tv up louder.  With this set up i dont have to infact i can hear just fine with just the bose.

Awesome. I had to go buy other parts to make it work.

I guess my only negative comment was that it is hard to tell some of the settings like automatic turn on vs manual.  I like the multi-use remote that came with it.  There are a few functions that don't port over but for the most part it does the job.  I thought I found a better deal at Costco which was $20 cheaper, but it turned out to be a different model that came with just a basic remote and a wall bracket.

I sure would like to hear it play over the optic wires which it is capable of. Well, maybe, just maybe, I will get to experience it yet.

"I love Bose speakers; however this soundbar leaves some to be desired. The reason I purchased it is that I cannot hear the people talking in movies, since the sound effects and music drown the spoken words. This soundbar does not help. I also don't like the volume control. In this day in age I expect to visualize the volume on the screen of the TV. With this soundbar you have no clue where you stand ( like in 1960). You would think that the volume bar would be shown at the bottom of the screen.It works well as a Bluetooth speaker. Pairs easily to a laptop or smartphone.",3,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
Not much difference between this and my speakers in tv. And return/back button on remote doesn’t work and hasn’t in years but BOSE apparently doesn’t care and has done nothing to correct it. I should have gone a different route. Not what I was expecting from Bose.,1,1,2020-5-8,1,2,0
"What led me to finally purchase a sound bar to replace  our Sharp LCD TV speakers, was on christmas day with only 2 visitors, it was hard for the kids to hear a movie that was playing from a blue ray disc (even with the TV volume all the way up,) over a normal adult conversation.My expectation was not that a sound bar would be as good as a full surround sound setup, but  that it would at least split the difference between a full sound system and my TVs speakers.  I was expecting a little more bass, more volume capability, and just a noticable but not overwhelming improvement in overall listening experience.  I dont feel like this sound bar does any of those things.  I havent noticed an improvement of sound quality or even the capability to top the 10 year old TV speakers in volume,  even with the sound bar turned all the way up.  So if you're looking for a sound bar to do what I was expecting this to do, than I would research some different brands, because this one just won't, maybe another one with a subwoofer and some more wattage will.  And in the odd case that your TV still works but the speakers are just blown, there are probably cheaper sound bars that will simply replace but not improve upon your audio, I wouldn't spend 200$ on this one.  I've only had this sound bar for a short time, so if I discover a way to a better experience due to a detail I have overlooked then I shall revise this review to reflect that.  *UPDATE*  I moved the soundbar from our large living room to our mid size bedroom.  The unit is clearly better suited for a bedroom ours is about 15'×17'.  I'm leaving the score as is though because for the price point, I would expect more than just mild improvement in sound for a bedroom tv",3,1,2018-12-29,1,0,0

I can hear what is being said without turning the volume up to high.  Not sure why some say that it doesn't get loud because I had to turn the volume down. i have a 55 inch Samsung TV and that may account for the difference.Bottom line is that I wish I bought this unit sooner.,5,1,2019-1-30,1,1,0

"I like everything about my Bose Solo 5 soundbar. I purchased it because I am planning on moving out to an apartment in the future, so for now, it's in my bedroom. I've only owned it for a week so I know I'm writing a review a little early.Let me start with saying that this soundbar produces great sound, high volume, and I absolutely love the way it can produce just the right amount of bass for pleasurable listening while at the same time not disturbing your neighbors/other rooms in your house. Crisp sound. There is a bass button on the remote for extra bass, which I leave on, and it does produce sufficient bass for me. There is also a dialogue button for when the volume goes down during movies when they are talking, this works very well. Others might say it's not suitable for a living room, but I give it 5 stars all the way around.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,1,0
"This sound bar delivers as promised, speech quality is enhanced and clear. I bought this to enhance the audio of my flat screen TV. I normally have to put the volume of the tv so high sometimes that's yiu can hear it in the yard, and yet the speech is not good since the background noise is high too. But with the sound bar yiu can hear the speech clearly and crisp without the loud background noise. Additionally watching movies is much much more enjoyable with the clear sound effects.  Love this, Bose did it again for an affordable price. Highly recommend this product.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,1,0
"I ordered this sound bar to replace an older Visio unit.  My main reason for doing so was to be able to control the sound bar with my Direct TV remote.  I find myself changing the volume a lot (commercials etc.) and hate to have to switch between remote controllers.  I assumed a newer unit would be programable.  This is not the case.  This Sound bar can not be controlled with a Direct TV remote.  The Direct TV can be controlled with the Bose remote; however, it is very sluggish and really just doesn't work very good.  Second reason was I expected a little crisper sound from a Bose product.  I can not detect any improvement in sound quality compared to my older Visio unit.  The final blow to this unit is that it does not power up when I turn the TV on (my Visio unit did).  This is a major annoyance.  So I get an extra remote with similar if to worse sound quality compared to my old unit and have to turn the thing on manually every time I turn the TV on..  Waste of money for me which is a surprise because all of my other Bose equipment is exceptional.",2,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"First off, I bought this unit almost 2 years ago to use for a small Samsung smart TV with typical crappy speakers. I own many Bose products that are still going strong and love their products. This particular unit was amazing for about 6 months and then just stopped working....completely. I meant to deal with it right away, but you know how life can take over and since it was in our Class A RV, out of sight, out of mind and here I am. I have sinced taken the unit in my house and tried it there today, but still no dice. Super bummed I waited so long, and I think I was out of luck after 6 months anyway with how businesses are run nowadays, but for the money I would get something else. Thing looks like it just came out of the box, but wont make a peep. Thumbs down Bose!",2,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"The sound quality is good however is very low. I have a a wireless $30 speaker that is much louder. The sound bar’s remote lacks the ability to control Roku and Amazon stick, its pretty disappointing because this sound bar was not cheap.

"Really wanted to like this sound system.  Want to start with the fact that my television is a few years old, which we think might have been the problem.  Though I'm not upgrading a perfectly good tv.  The sound system only worked with my antenna, and dvds.  The system partially worked when plugged directly into my bluray player.  It oddly worked on bluray though the menu music, but as soon as you hit play….no more sound.  Worked fine with dvds.  Wouldn’t work at all with my Roku.  Found it odd that the sound system only worked with my antiquated technology.",2,1,2019-7-10,1,1,0
"Anyone with a flat screen TV, owes themselves to buy a separate sound solution, due to difficulties in installing a reasonable sounding sound solution within the thinness of the TV.  With that in mind, there might be a better TV sound solution than what I bought, which is Bose, but you cannot go wrong with this purchase.  Sound is loud and clear, with very good build.

The included universal remote is now the only remote I use.I want to be clear that this isn’t a top of the line home theater sound system, but it provides good sound that is much better than the tv speakers. I’m most impressed with its ability to make dialogue much more clearer.  This product has definitely enhanced my viewing experience and has replaced a much more expensive multi-speaker home theater system that required multiple remote controls.",5,1,2017-12-1,1,8,0
"Perfect sound bar for watching TV and an occasional movie.  The quality of the sound is excellent.  When you turn on the dialog, one can hear voices very clear above all the music racket.  My only complaint is that one has to turn on the dialog every time you switch between Sat, DVD, and Firestick.  Since I am using a universal remote (not the one supplied), it is necessary to keep the Bose remote handy.",5,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
"This was a great addition to my Entertainment setup. I have an 12 year old TV and 20 year old surround sound system that I was using. The TV is still in use. Luckily I have an Optical cable port and plugged it straight in to the TV from the sound bar and it works great. The sound quality is superb except for the Bass. I was a little shocked considering it is a BOSE product, and all of their previous products I've ever owned have never lacked in sound quality. It has enough, but when your watching something with action the bass doesn't surround you like it should compared to the Mids and Highs.

I visited a boutique electronics shop in a mall in downtown Portland Oregon because I spotted the high end $3500 soundbar. It blew me away. Lusted for it, knowing I could never afford one before I die.

I’ve watched one of my favorite movies on countless different TVs and there was always one part I couldn’t understand what was said. I’d replay over and over to no avail and it was so frustrating.  I watched said movie with this sound bar and understood what was said the first time. Sounds like it’s not a big deal but to me it was. The sound is crisp and easily heard regardless of background sound. I don’t normally make big purchases like this especially since this is really a ‘want’, not ‘need’ scenario. But in this case I’m glad I did.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0

I told them it was coming back and they didn't care.",1,1,2020-1-19,1,1,0
"Wow. Easy set up. Synced with my Sanyo TV. The Dialogue button is just what my 92 yr Mom needed. The sound is crystal clear. Very pleased so far. Only complaint was the packaging from Amazon. Thank goodness Bose had packed it well. It came in a Amazon box way too long and wide and there was no bubble wrap. So the Bose certainly had a jostled ride here but so far seems to have arrived unscathed.

"We have an older, large Visio Tv and it and an annoying buzz during the bass moments while watching The Walking Dead. We have a little Bose speaker we have had for years and we love it so I figured all things Bose would be amazing. I was raised on Paul Harvey so what can I say? Anyway, this speaker is fine for The Walking Dead no more buzzing bass, but I watched the movie “The Dirt“ (about Motley Cru) and it was not so great. Bottom line, if you want an ok speaker for dialogue it’s fine but if you want the option to crank the volume and jam to music don’t bother. My biggest problem is the fact that you can see the volume control so I keep trying to turn it up not knowing if I have maxed it out or not. I’d prob send it back if I had not already trashed the box.",3,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
"We purchased 2 of these as gifts for Christmas. One for my father in law who has a 40"" Samsung 4k TV and one for my mother in law who has a 27"" Toshiba TV. I did the install on both sound bars. They were super easy to set up and it came with a very nice remote that is programmable. That is where anything positive I have to say ends. I have little Bluetooth speakers that sound better than these Bose. I made sure all the connections were solid, we played around with the feature to bump up the dialogue sound which really did not do much. On both TV's I had it switched so the TV speakers were turned off and it was S/PDIF out only. I would have thought it was a fluke if it was just one TV. I had the same experience on both TV's. The actual built in TV speakers sounded better to be honest. This is my 1st Bose  purchase and my last. I had heard they were way overpriced and now I have learned 1st hand,",1,1,2018-12-28,1,1,0
"I really thought this soundbar would sound better. I have one of the Soundlink color speakers and it sounds great, so I figured this would sound much better. I was wrong. The quality of the sound is quite flat. Almost no bass whatsoever. Sure, it's better than your TV speakers, but not by much. I returned it and got a Vizio setup for less money that sounds a whole lot better.",3,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"I'll start with this, I have a Soundlink Mini 2 I bought by Bose about 4 years ago and I love it, the battery won't last for more than an hour now but thats to be expected for a rechargeable portable speaker.I picked up the box and was immediately concerned, the mini was almost as heavy as this thing! The speakers in this are cheap, and in my opinion they used the Bose name to squeeze an extra $75 bucks out of people. I have a feeling I could've bought the $90 Vizio sound bar at Walmart and it would've sounded almost exactly the same. Do yourself a favor, save the money and buy a soundbar without the Bose name on it",3,1,2020-6-7,1,1,0
"I am hard of hearing and I have to turn up our TV speakers so that everyone else is uncomfortable.  I have tried, with little success, to use other sound bars and remote blue tooth speakers.  This is better than anything else we have tried.  One function lets you hear speech more clearly - that is worth the $ for me.  Most of the other features do not work very well.  It comes with a rather large and complicated remote that only adjusts the volume and turns on the speech clarity feature.  I have not been able to get it to replace our Specturm remote.  It does worn that this may be the case.",4,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
I actually (we) love it because it has wonderful crisp sound and great bass setting if you need it and the biggest plus is the volume actually stays where you set it unlike regular television volume that gets louder and even at times quieter when it switches to commercials I would highly suggest if you are irritated by the fluctuation in television volume when switching to commercial/sponsor breaks where you have to continually raise or lower volume. ***** stars Big Red L.P.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,1,0
"Bose really missed the mark with this one.  I have the Bose Mini and the sound quality is exponentially better!  I have the bass adjusted to the max and it's pathetic.  I tried several different music genres.  For watching TV, it's good enough.  The tweeters sound great but overpower the bass.  If you enjoy watching action movies or listening to any music with a beat, look elsewhere and don't buy this thinking what I did -- how could Bose not make a high-quality product? Certainly, the reviews are an anomaly.  Nope!  Keep shopping, folks.  The reviews on the Bose website are also low (3-star average), FYI.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0

I can hook my phone up through Bluetooth and hear the music all throughout my apartment (sorry neighbors). The setting for dialogue actually works, I can hear the conversation OVER the explosions or music. The remote is pretty big, but you can use it for your TV too.

"Nice sound, and can work with Tivo remote (but setting it up as A/V receiver controlled volume). Dislike its remote, its a large clunky universal remote that really only has 2-3 features the sound bar needs, would have been better just to include a small remote for the sound bar.Getting the auto-wake to work was tricky.  I would put unit in auto-wake mode (hold power switch for 5 seconds toggles auto-wake).  To see that I was in auto-wake, I would turn off the TV and manually turn off the unit, and the unit's LED would turn amber, as the user guide specified.  I then would turn on the TV, and no volume would come out of  the unit, and the LED remained amber (standby mode??).  Finally figured out that the unit has to auto-powerdown to then auto-wake.  After about 1 hour or no TV, the unit will auto-power down, turning LED from green to amber.  Then when TV is powered up, unit will auto-wake.  Very frustrating to figure this out.",4,1,2018-11-26,1,2,0
"It's a real pleasure to actually understand dialogue in movies and TV shows, now. This feature is of supreme quality and thus makes this a worthwhile purchase. And the music sounds good, too! I'm still trying to find the right balance for the bass. We are pleased with our purchase. Because it is not Alexa-friendly (my fault for not understanding that), we give 4 out of 5 stars.

The remote control from the bose somehow does not let me press ok. So I have to press ok with my LG remote. I also dont like how you have to go back and forth between two remote control. I wish there is a way to control bose sounding system with LG TV remote. However, sound is okay.

I've owned multiple Bose product over the years and always loved them hence wanted to go with this system even though i could probably find a better sounding product in the same price range.However, this is the first time i am having an issue with a Bose product partly due to a poor design choice. Seems like the IR receiver on the speaker is broken and there is no other way of controlling the product other than the remote, there are no physical buttons whatsoever. Only function i use the remote for is to adjust the volume and with IR receiver no longer working, the product is basically useless now. How much i wish they would've at least included a physical button for such a basic function like adjusting volume, oh well its an expensive paper weight now :(",2,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
The Bose Solo 5 soundbar is really just a glorified speaker for your TV. If you are thinking it is a surround sound soundbar you will be greatly disappointed. There is nothing wrong with it as a TV speaker if that is what you are looking for. I am actually able to hear my TV clearly when it gets noisy in my house. You can Bluetooth from your phone to listen to music. Sounds great. I love the universal remote. Took three remotes to one. Awesome. Easy set up. No hookup for a base speaker or additional speakers.

My Soundlink Mini offers better bass also. This won't deter me from buying Bose in the future, as my Soundlink Mini is a superior portable speaker.

I haven’t gone to the trouble of programming the remote to the TV yet to make it universal.  It looks straightforward.  I am pleased with the purchase.

I've always thought Bose products sounded great but never had any.  I had a Yahoo soundbar with wireless woofer and the sound what I had hoped for and the dialog was hard for me to understand.

I have my DVR and Blu-Ray player connected to the HDMI ports of my TV, using the optical cable to connect to the Solo 5.

"Love our Soundtouch 300, which we use with the base block and hidden speakers in our home theater. based on our experience with the Soundtouch 300 (not to mention multiple pairs of headphones and bluetooth speakers), we decided to order a bose solo 5 when we needed a simple sound bar to improve the volume on a 50” Samsung in our breakfast room area. despite the great features such as voice isolation and clarity enhancement, as well as decent build quality, the solo 5’s inexplicably low max volume setting (the core function of this small sound bar) makes it a fail! while the volume, which gets only slightly louder than the volume of the TV without the sound bar, can be set to a comfortable level in a quite room, add running water or activity in the nearby kitchen (or just background noise like talking) and the tv becomes difficult to impossible to hear (same for our teenage daughters). Although  I would give a 5 star rating if the max volume was increased 25%, i cannot give more than two stars due to the inexplicably low ceiling on the max volume setting, which is the single most important function of this product.  i can’t recommend this product.",2,1,2018-1-1,1,7,0

The bar is small in width so it fit well with my gear.  it is an excellent booster speaker if you are using it with the speakers on the TV activated.

I like the convenience of being able to stream via bluetooth from my phone if I'm just puttering around the house and not actively listening to music.  It's no high end stereo, but it's an amazing little soundbar. One thing we noticed immediately is that their idea of an ""amber"" led is quite reddish.

"I have to agree with the many reviews that said this was a low end bar that provides a very modest upgrade in sound for a flat screen TV.  If you're expecting big theater sound you're going to be disappointed.  That said, I'm okay with that.  It does provide more volume, and the dialogue enhancement does help with some movies.  I had listened to this at our local Best Buy before buying.  Actually would have bought it there if a sales person was available, but gave up after waiting for 10 minutes.  It sounded okay when I was standing right in front of it.  And in a smaller room it's probably okay.  We have a fairly large family room, so a bit of the improvement gets lost. I didn't want a subwoofer on the floor, the small footprint was attractive.  I knew that this meant smaller sound, but being a Bose,  I was hoping it wasn't that small.It was very easy to set up.

If you're lucky it will happen while in warranty, if not, it's $99 (including shipping label from Bose) and about 3 weeks to have it repaired and returned with a 1 year warranty.  Sorry, but I'm not willing to spend another $99 for a $199 unit for another year of use, not knowing when it will drop dead again.  I'm also going to question the purchase of any other Bose products because of possible quality issues.",2,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"The bose bar was a bit smaller than anticipated. But as it turns out, it is perfect for our entertainment area. It is loud if you want loud. It syncs with my spotify bluetooth app on my phone and is great sound. It has a dialogue setting which clarifies the movies dialogue when it's hard to hear what's being said. Would highly recommend this item.",5,1,2020-4-5,1,1,0
"I am so pleased with the Bose 5 sound bar. I had recently purchased another Bose sound bar but when I read about the function to make voices clearer, I bought this one. And sure enough it does bring out the voices and I don’t need to turn the volume up, which doesn’t help anyway, or use closed caption which is distracting.  The remote control for the Bose 5 is a universal remote and I have everything programmed to just one remote. I no longer need three remotes and I love it.  Also, I paid less for the Bose 5 than the lesser quality Bose sound bar. I recommend the Bose 5 sound bar.",5,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0
I had another soundbar that never seemed to connect to my TV's.  This Bose had super easy connection and perfect instructions that were clear and worked!  Set up in minutes.  Seems to work fine.  Will be moving to an apartment and will see how that works for us.,4,1,2018-7-27,1,3,0
"The name should speak for itself. Bose; synonymous with quality, brilliance, and precision. I sound like a commercial...However, the soundbar is easy to setup and is also quite compact. Its size will have you skeptical, until you hear the performance. It’s perfect for most any room with a limited budget as well as available space. This soundbar will enhance your viewing and/or listening experience tremendously. You won’t be disappointed...",5,1,2020-2-29,1,1,0
"I bought this item, because I love Bose products and I know that they work amazingly great, but unfortunately I couldn't hooked up with my TV (which is an old one, even that I bought the extra stuff in order to do so).

"Plastic housing. That's it.Now that my displeasure has been noted. Everything else is a Dream. My sound in my living room is so much better than my speakers for me qled tv. They are good if you only want those. I wanted better and this is. I only used the BT functions and TV, my universal remote is 1/4 the size of the Bose. I stuck with that. Duh.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"Simple to install and the sound was incredible for one week. Takes up very little space. Did not expect such big sound from such a small sound bar until one week later then the sound was horrible. Very disappointed in this product. I have always had good luck with Bose but this does not have the quality I have previously experienced. My LG TV Built in speakers sound so much better then the Bose sound bar and that is not saying too much for Bose. I definitely do not recommend this product, sorry Bose!!!",1,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0

"I was truly disappointed in this soundbar.  I expected more from Bose. The bass sounded lumpy, the midrange was okay, but the high frequencies were worse than the built in speakers.  The volume capability was also less than the built in speakers.  I would say don't waste your money on this soundbar, unless you have horrible built in speakers and your willing to accept mediocre sound.On the positive side it was extremely easy to setup and functioned just fine.  The remote is a bit clunky, but works.",2,1,2020-8-10,1,1,0
"Had a set of 901's and really expected more from Bose.. Not nearly enough volume and no pairing capability makes this a bad deal at any price.

"The best attribute of this sound bar is the value, if your just looking to improve the sound over your TV's sound output without having to go with a multi-speaker system. Delivers crisp sound that gives you the big speaker feel that sufficiently fills the room. Very easy set-up, plug and play, nothing complicated at all. Remote has all the features you would need, controls cable box and many other functions. Again, if your looking for a relatively cheap alternative to the super surround system, this speaker will do the trick.",4,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"I bought this for a Sony TV.  It did not work.  It sounds great with my bluetooth devices but my TV, the reason I bought it, it did not.  I spoke with customer service who directed me to Sony. turns out that if your TV has the ARC sound system you will require an adapter and even that is not guaranteed.  the instructions looked so easy and I bought this for movies but now it is just another music player until my optical audio to arc converter arrives.  I will update this review once I receive the adapter.  Just be aware this is not as easy as it looks.",2,1,2018-12-18,1,1,0
"I am a ""techie"" but survived a massive stroke. Severe short term memory deficits. Set up was easy. I have a MacBook Pro audio connected via bluetooth. Pairing was easy.

TV connected via Optical Digital....Works very well, and sound is amazing, as you would expect from BOSE. Instructions are easy to follow, and straightforward.",5,1,2018-1-26,1,2,0
"I spent the $200 on this to upgrade from my Visio surround sound. Everyone said “just do the sound bar” and everyone loves Bose. I have a Bluetooth speaker of theirs that I love.This one I don’t. The maximum sound on this is disappointing.  The quality of the sound is ok, there’s no rattle or anything, but the quality for music it’s just not what i expected from them :( I thought it would be much louder.",2,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"I'm disappointed with the sound. Not bose quality. If they are cutting corners due to the price, I'd wouldn't make it, its bose reputation on the line and I have other bose products and im happy with them. I do have to say that problem with almost all of bose products is that there is no volume level to guide youm just a blinking light. As for this sound bar, it falls near all the reat cheap sound bars out there. So with that being said... your options widens then. You need not choose this sound bar simply for the name brand. Might as well be made in China with low quality parts available in the market.",3,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"This sound bar does provide excellent sound quality given its size.However, the remote could have cut some real cost from this product as it was designed as a universal remote as if every single item one buys needs a universal remote. And the remote is HUGE. Set it up, place the remote in a box along with all your other universal remotes.",3,1,2019-10-6,1,1,0
Bought this to use with a 55” Samsung smart tv and was very disappointed. The speakers built into the tv are louder than the sound bar. I’ve had other Bose products in the past and am still using another soundbar on a different tv that works great and can dwarf the sound of this sound bar. I would’ve bought another one of the one I already have but they stopped making it a few years ago so figured I’d try the “new model.” 100% not up to par with what I’ve come to expect from Bose and definitely not worth the money.  I will be returning this and investigating other options. Very disappointing as I have been a loyal Bose customer over the years and expected better from them.,1,1,2019-10-4,1,1,0
"Clarify is A+. I am thrilled with the bar and wish I hadn't waited so long thinking about whether or not it was worth the money . I also feel you'd be hard pressed to find another bar in this price range that could deliver what you're looking for.To be exact, I had a Tenker crap-bar (something like 60 bucks) that was a small improvement over regular TV speakers. It would go in and out, not register deeper sounds in a good way, had to be turned up all the way and created a strange nauseating feeling that I'd never experienced before with loud movies or music.",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"I own several Bose products which are great. This Bose Solo 5 TV Sound System is a dismal failure. I just bought a new Sony TV, Samsung Disc Player, and Comcast Xfinity Control System with voice operation.

"Not sure about the different negative reviews.  I received mine today - installed according to the directions (which were easy for me to follow).  I set the unit in front of my 32"" flat screen (a Samsung - which is approx. 6 yrs old). I immediately turned it on and turned up the volume - GREAT sound quality - that was about 1:00pm.  It is now 7:45pm - unit has been on the entire time - it does not feel hot as 1 reviewer had indicated.  At this point I am extremely pleased with my Bose Solo 5 TV Soundbar!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,1,0
The sound and features are really good. The only issue I had was trying to figure out how to make it work for my TV . Some TVs mine being one the fiber optic input to the  sound bar required some programing changes with in my TV . I started to send back thinking it didn't work until some you tube videos explained similar issues. The instructions might need to explain this a little . It would eliminate some confusion and heart ache.,4,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"Sounds so weird but the remote that came with the sound bar is amazing, it fits my hand nicely.  It's big enough it doesn't fall through the couch seams which I will say has cut back on my cardio since I'm no longer moving couches or walking around the entire living room looking for the little apple remote.  It was so easy to follow the YouTube how to program the remote.  The sound bar is great too, its a Bose soundbar of course its great.",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"Maybe ok for a small room where you want to keep the noise down (??) but it does not add anything or do anything that my TV can’t do (2018 Samsung). My room is not huge but it has a tall ceiling. Sitting about 10 ft away, it just wouldn’t get loud enough. I thought about keeping it for my home gym but honestly my Bose Bluetooth Wireless Speaker works just as well. I was hopeful for the Bose product but will prob need to spend more money for more power -speakers, sub, etc. Will be returning.",2,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"The sound bar looks nice, but that’s about all it has going for it. Using the optical cord that came in the box I tested a few different things (movies, tv, music, etc.) and in every category the internal speakers of the TV sounded miles better. The sound quality of this speaker is frankly horrible and sounds like it’s coming from a tin can. My tv does have Dolby Atmos speakers internally, so I realize they will sound better than the average tv speakers. If you’re looking to replace poor tv speakers, this sound bar is not worth the money. Im returning it immediately.",1,1,2020-3-28,1,1,0
"The item was easy to set up and worked great right out of the box.  Directions were clear and fairly easy to follow.  A person in our household has hearing aids and this has helped enormously to keep the volume down to a tolerable level.

The Bose Solo 5 does a fabulous job of boosting the audio from our LG UHD TV.  The voice enhancement mode is great for clarifying that sometimes hard-to-understand-speech in some movies.

"This little soundbar fills the apartment living room with clear, layered, sound. I've watched movies, tv shows, and played music synced with my phone. Its awesome! The remote was also easy to pair with my tv and dvr. Its replaced my other universal remote. The ONLY downside i've found with it is a personal preference. It would simplify things if when turning on the tv, it would turn the soundbar on at the same time. As it is, its only another second to power them on separately.",5,1,2017-3-23,1,2,0
"This replaced a full (old school) home theater system. I've been simplifying my house dramatically and wanted something to replace my bulky old home theater, with it's 6 speakers, receiver, wiring/cables, and power strip. This one speaker sounds better than my whole older system did. I was expecting it not to sound the greatest, going by the reviews here. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound from this little soundbar. I really like the remote, it replaced three of my older remotes. A tip to people just beginning with the solo 5: make sure you adjust the bass how you like it, as printed in the manual. I found I needed the bass up pretty high to compensate for the lack of a sub woofer. Great speaker for the money",5,1,2017-5-31,1,7,0
"Initially it didn't knock my socks off, however once I began playing with the bass settings I was blown away. This little speaker puts out very good bass it won't shake the walls hehe but you will definitely feel it when it counts. If you're in an apartment like me and want to enjoy good bass and clarity without becoming a nuisance then this is surely for you. I have never used it at full volume because it gets extremely loud in my space. The sound bounces off the walls perfectly. Just play with the bass until you reach a level that is pleasing to you, increasing the bass is what really brings this soundbar to life.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,1,1

"We set this up in our living room, and it had less volume amplitude than the internal speaker of the TV it was hooked up to.  I thought this has a lot of great features, including dialogue mode.  If you have a smaller room and a more quiet life (we have 2 kids and a dog), then perhaps this could work for you.We wound up returning this and we're looking for a more powerful soundbar, and perhaps one with a subwoofer.",3,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"Great sound! I love this product. Enhances television sound quality a lot. Universal setup was so easy (Samsung tv) and did away with my separate remotes for tv and cable box, by programming. Also functions as a Bluetooth speaker, so this is like 3 products in one (universal remote, tv sound bar and Bluetooth speaker) and . the adjustable bass and voice enhancement work well. I love this sound bar!!!",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Enjoying the Solo 5 SoundBar a lot! The quality is just how I expected it to be as I own a few other Bose products and they're always great. Setting it up also incredibly simple and took about 2 minutes to get it going.1 downside of the SoundBar is the enormous remote. It's just way too big and it has way too many buttons. I've had it for about 2 weeks and all I've used is ""Power"", ""Volume Up"", and ""Volume Down."" The other problem is that there is no way to see the Min or Max of the volume when you're adjusting the level. The Soundbar just flashes a green light but doesn't have any other visual queues.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I have purchased Bose products my entire life, and hoped this sound bar would be on par with other speakers. It’s OK, good compact size, easy to install, but not the same sound quality I would expect from Bose. Its an acceptable TV Speaker, not sure its worth $200",4,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"The sound bar does not pair with spectrum tv  and I was going to return it. I called CS and they had one code that only works on audio on the remote but doesn’t change channels so I need to keep 2 remotes around. I bought it because it offers a talk enhancement as I have trouble hearing talk on the tv. That feature works well but for nearly $200.00 the unit is not worth the cost, headphones work better.  So if you have spectrum tv, don’t buy this sound bar.",2,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"My wife has a hard time hearing the tv in our bedroom so I got the Bose Solo 5 Sound Bar to help. Since we are both in our late 60’s it’s no wonder. It works great especially with the voice enhancement feature for watching late news and late night talk shows. It does enhance the voices a little without loosing sound quality of everything else. I got two pieces of aluminum bar and mounted the sound bar onto the tv wall mount directly below the tv so it looks good too. What I really like is that I was able to set up the cable box, the tv and the sound bar to work with just the Bose remote.",5,1,2019-8-14,1,0,1

Nope!The Bose sound bar provides clear, quality audio that had me wanting to go back and re-watch movies with the new sound quality.

"This is not the answer for a full on surround system, but for an extremely high quality upgrade to your tv speakers with just enough boom, this is the answer. Sounds great for the tv or for a Bluetooth speaker for use with pandora, etc. it fills my living room with high quality sound in a small package. Plus there’s the obvious trust with the Bose name attached. It won’t let you down. The bass won’t fill the room but it’s just enough to allow full enjoyment. If you desire room shaking surround and booming bass, this isn’t the solution. If you want a reasonably priced, high quality, great sounding compact sound bar, buy this!!!!",5,1,2018-8-29,1,2,0
"This sound bar does not support CEC connections to smart TV's. Some TV's call it ARC connection. The code for the TV does not work, meaning the soundbar remote will not connect to the TV, and the TV does not control the soundbar because it does not have a HDMI connection, which is needed to sync the control. Had this been explicit when making the purchase I would not have purchased it. My opinion is that BOSE created an inferior product. The sound is nothing to complain about, but a TV watching experience is more than just the sound.",3,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0
"My husband and I have a hard time with shows that have a ton of loud music behind the conversations.  This Bose Solo 5 Soundbar has made a huge difference.

The Dialogue is clear and we don't have to turn up the volume.  Great value, also.  Thank you, Bose!",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"It's cumbersome to use because you have to use a handheld controller to turn it on and adjust the volume. Partially deaf so I use mine with my computer station as I frequently play videos and listen/watch the news.

Don't expect any mid range or bass frequencies out of it.",4,1,2019-1-10,1,1,0

I had a sound bar that cost less than 100.00 on my TV. The Bose sound quality is superior to the one I took off.  Base response is a lot better but if you like thumping base buy a sub woofer. I use this on my second TV and it fits that use very well. The only minus is there is no way to tell how much volume you have coming out of the unit. Not lights to show how much volume you are using or when the unit reaches max volume. Sound is clear and deep enough to fill the room nicely. The voice enhancer is an easy one button to activate.,5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

"I have a decent 2016 Vizo smarcast television. The speakers suck, and blew out literally the first week of using the television. I am an audiophile and have been a life long fan of Bose engineering. In all honesty in terms of sound I was definitely impressed with this bose system especially for the price. Granted I've only had the soundbar for 2 days now. I am interested to see how it holds up.I am 28 and technically savy but not a genius. I did find the installation to be easy, however the way the bluetooth interfaces with most televisions is quarky at best. But i don't think any firmware update could really fix it. Be sure once you finish programming the remote to turn on the speaker and disable your tv's speakers within the TV's audio settings which will allow the television to utilize the external audio source. Overall I am very impressed with my purchase and I hope these speakers do not blow out but get better with time. Only time will tell.",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I was disappointed in the sound quality from this.  I expected MUCH more from Bose based on the sound I get from my Bose iPod dock speaker.  It did enhance the sound of dialog a tiny bit, but the overall sound coming from the built-in speakers on my Sony Bravia is much better.  It has an option to increase or decrease the bass, but there is no level indicator so you have no idea if it is actually changing it or not, of if you have reached the limit. Either way, the adjustment seemed to do little.",3,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0

"If you're like me, and are considering buying this item because you have a hard time hearing the dialog on a lot of TV shows today, don't waste your time. My experience led to no noticeable difference between this product and the inferior speakers mounted in my 2 year old LG. It hooks up easy enough with the included optical cable, but the dialog and bass buttons on the oversized remote control must be ""dummy"" buttons because they made no difference in the sound.

So, it sits in the box on my living room floor until we decide what to do with it.Therefore no ratings on features",1,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"Bought the Solo 5 in February, didnt have a chance to inststall it until March. Worked during the evening when I intalled it. Next day, power goes off and doesnt come back on. Apparently, this seems to happen frequently given the number of posts online that can be found. I tried all the recommended procedures such as unplugging and waiting a few minutes before replugging. Nothing. Now i have to box it and return. Will look for another brand to exchange with on Amazon given my experience and given several comments that there is another brand out there with better performance and a better price.",1,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"Great sound quality. Installation was a breeze. Now I am only using one remote for the tv and cable box. If you’re looking for a surround sound, this isn’t it.",5,1,2018-12-25,1,2,0
Big improvement for our Sharp tv. We can now hear the dialogue. Very happy with this compact sound bar. Installation was a bit tricky because we are not very good with electronics but we figured it out.,5,1,2020-1-27,1,1,0
"Sound bar is fantastic, my second purchase of this item. I wear hearing aids (ran a jackhammer in my youth) and this item allows my to understand most TV dialogue again. But they replaced the small and elegant remote with a brick from the 90s, mostly useful for self defense. It weighs two pounds, is half the size of the sound bar, and has 50 buttons to control everything. Sadly, it's IR. Most current devices are Bluetooth. Although remote can connect to Bluetooth devices, all it does is turn them on and off. For a few bucks, I got a replacement remote, the small, elegent one, and now couldn't be happier.",4,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
"Sounds alright. Not what I've come to expect from a Bose product even despite the size. The biggest problem (which many others have experienced) is that the ""universal"" remote doesn't have 100% functionality with Samsung TVs. The back function won't work with any of the apps, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu. Super annoying because the sound bar can't be controlled with any other remote than what came with it. Would have liked to have kept this but not having a back button is a deal breaker.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0

"This soundbar has a lot of good qualities which are all undermined by the extremely low quality optical port in the back...  I want to love this soundbar, but did the engineers who created this actually try to plug it in to an optical audio source?  When I plug in the supplied optical cable it will fall out unless positioned perfectly.  This makes me feel like the port could break at any time.  If you are someone who enjoys buying a product with longevity, look elsewhere.",3,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0

I would like a bit more base so I would put the sound quality between a 3 and 4 but it still sound really good.  I travel for work and it's a small enough size where I can bring it and for projector.  I love it for that.  I believe it could come down a little in price but it is a Bose and I've always been pleased with my Bose products.  Also comes with a crazy remote that looks like you can control everything in your house with (lol).  I have not tested any of those features,4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"So the sound quality in this is fine, good enough to be expected for the price. I like the dialogue button to hear conversations better. But this remote is ridiculous, it’s HUGE. What I hate even more is when changing volume you can’t see the level and to make any change in noticeable volume you have to go up or down A LOT. Disappointed as a whole but I guess the sound is pretty good and that’s the main point, right?",3,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"Was hoping for a better solution for the terrible sound that comes out of my television set. I thought that Bose would be the best on the market, however I’m finding that this speaker system does not have good controls.

I love this Bose Solo 5 sound bar. I was having the issue of having to turn up the volume to understand the voice over the back ground sound. The Bose Sole 5 has a voice button that brings the voice forward without compromising the back ground sound. I can now listen to TV without changing the volume all of the time. I can listen at a really low volume and clearly understand the voice. It is great!,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"It's a great sound bar..  For the price, there are probably better options anymore..  I got this for the slim line appearance and it gets that down well..

This is a great small-medium sized speaker with clear sound. I use as an add-on speaker to a Teac desktop stereo system with RCA line out and an adaptor stereo cable. This system in a room abouut 10' x 12' in size. If you are looking for loud/ full sound in a larger room this product may not be adequate.,5,1,2019-1-7,1,1,0

The sound is much better than the tv speakers but I expected and even better fuller sound that I am getting considering it is a Bose.  So a bit disappointed as it doesn't have that full stereo sound I love.  The remote is huge which isn't a problem but the code doesn't work for my samsung tv.I don't mind using 2 remotes but my husband doesn't like it.,3,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
Todays modern TV's sound is not so good for the hard of hearing senior's. This speaker has improved dialog. My only small complaint is the volume control has no visual display and dialog button can not be transferred to cable remote. The provided Bose remote was not user friendly with my system. But these complaints do not override the fine dialog quality.,5,1,2019-3-25,1,1,0
"I was very disappointed with the overall sound quality of the sound bar. I have a five-year-old at Vizio sound bar that’s about twice the size that was developing a rattle and I purchased this to replace it. I assumed after five years the technology caught up which is why it is much smaller. Unfortunately, the sound quality reflects the size. I listen to a lot of big band and jazz music and the speaker does not have the range or fullness of sound for that kind of music. There are certain piano and guitar solos that I look forward to in these songs that are now washed out and hard to hear. With my Vizio at the top of a crescendo there’s a bit of an explosion or punch while with my Bose it came out very flat. Probably good for the everyday TV watcher but but if you want to purchase this for music, I’d look elsewhere.",2,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
God we love this of course we love anything from Bose the sound is out of this world so clear we have it hooked up to our tv and the Bluetooth is really good also.

It's already packed up.",2,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
It has good sound in general but I’m disappointed with the feature that supposedly makes dialog more clear eliminating background music. I don’t think it does that at all. I bought it mainly because I needed that feature due to a hearing issue.,3,1,2019-5-19,1,1,0

I was totally disappointed with the quality of the sound, the difficulty of setting up the remote and just overall not pleased with this Bose product.

"I was expecting the soundbar to automatically replace the tv soind and to be able to control the volume with the tv remote, but it doesn't work that way. You must mute or turn of the tv volume and then use the bose remote to control the volume. That is really inconvenient. The quality is not what I expected from Bose. It sounds slightly better than the tv.As far as a speaker for my phone, the pairing is not automatic. I have to use the bose remote and set it to bluetooth  for it to pair which is also inconvenient.",3,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0

If you do that is also easy.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
I bought this soundbar because I wanted a speaker for my micro home theater projector that would operate via Bluetooth and sync with my new Apple TV device wirelessly.

"I bought this hoping for the typical Bose experience and what a disappointment. The sound seems descent, however, you can only control the thing with the included universal remote, which is the size of an average man's slipper.

Sounds AMAZING! I got this soundbar because it's the only one I could find that wasn't super wide. The only downside is the large remote it comes with. I have a Samsung smart TV and a common issue with smart TVs is that the back button doesn't work which is SO FRUSTRATING! I tried to get help but it seems to be an issue with the remote itself and not my tv.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"I enjoy the soundbar. Gets loud, nice bass to it but not too bassy. Perfect for watching movies, sporting events and playing video games.

Great sound quality. Happy with the purchase. However I wish you could see the volume display on TV.

"The sound is just ok. The dialogue feature does help in understanding  spoken words, and it would be nice to have the system default to that mode if desired. Instead you have to select it each time you turn it on. Which brings up the biggest problem: the remote.It’s huge and unwieldy to use. Previous generations of the sound bar had a very small, easy to use remote just for controlling the sound. The new universal remote is a huge step backwards. It responds slowly or not at all when buttons are pressed, has to be aimed exactly at the device, and is unnecessary as everyone has their cable/satellite remote, which at least with Comcast, is markedly superior.  My cable remote has features that are lost if you use the Bose remote.",3,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"I have been a fan and owner of a few Bose products over the years, and have always found them to be dependable and of high quality.

But I believe no one will play wav out of a simple soundbar... Quality of the build is good, I also tested it with pink and white, turns out I found a boost around 350hz and 4500hz (around +5dB~+8dB) - it sounds normally cuz usually people use it for TV and dialogues.Stereo image is okay - but definitly a bit boxy.",4,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
Biggest thing I like is the fact that I don’t have to move the volume up with quiet speech times then down on loud action areas.

It is a univeral remote, I know, and I will try to figure it out so that even though it's big, it's the only one that I will need.  We shall see, it seems pretty complicated.

I have a Vizio sound bar in the other room of my house. The Vizio is cheaper but bigger and packs a bigger and better sound. I could have got a better sound from Vizio for $50 less but a bigger unit.

I do not recommend for the price sadly.,1,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
I think it sounds like any other sound bar. The bass does sound louder but then again that’s not so good when trying to understand what people are saying in a movie.

I used that button every  time but the difference in clarity was only somewhat better.  This Bose  does not have crisp, clear sound nor loud enough volume.  I'm 78 years old so my hearing may not be as sharp as a younger person's.",2,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
I ordered this based on the sound quality of other Bose speakers we own.  I would probably be happy with the sound quality but I compared new and old side by side.  However it does sound better than the TV’s speakers.  I would rather have a HDMI speaker that automatically coms on/off when the TV is powered on.,4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"Started a home theater. Not the dream by any means but it’s a good start. I love movies. I love shows. I love dialogue and stories. The hardest thing about sound systems is they are not balanced. Many times music can drown out dialogue. This speaker has figured out how to keep the clarity, the sharpness, and just basic dialogue heard. It’s not the surround sound of a movie theater at all. It’s not gonna blow you away if you are expecting to shake the roof off your house. BUT it is a great sound system. It’s balanced and very nice. It’s a great start. I will eventually upgrade but spending the extra $50-75 to get this one versus an LG or other brand is worth it.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"Not only is the sound great, but it was very easy to install.  We just hooked it into our tv and it worked like a charm.  We knew we could get better sound with a surround sound system, but since my husband's hearing is not that great, we went with the less expensive Bose.  I'm glad I finally made the purchase.",5,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
"I recently upgraded the cheap TV in our motorhome, and decided to add a sound bar at the same time.  The sound bar is nice, but really doesn't sound much better than the new Samsung TV I installed.

"Yes this easy to set up & that's a real plus but the sound quality is always muffled & it's difficult to adjust the volume as visually there is nothing to indicate the volume level going up or down.

The sound quality stands up to the Bose name however the volume is less than that of the tv current speaker. I have Bluetooth portables that are far louder. Shouldn’t even be sold.

The remote is Half the size of the speaker and has more buttons that you will never use and do not even work. You cannot connect Bluetooth to a computer and the auxiliary connection to a computer has the poorest sound quality ever. Sounds good connected to an iPhone. Tv quality is cheap.

I have Bose for everything sound related and it’s because once you get used to it you just can’t handle the low quality stuff!

"For the price, how small it is and the sound has everyone coming to my house asking about it and buying one. Already 4 ppl have bought it after hearing how amazing it sounds with movies and music.

I bought this for my husband.  We were looking for a sound bar without a seperate base for space reasons.  He is a huge musice freak and loves the speaker.The size is perfect.  It is not super large and fits perfectly with the 42 inch tv in my hubny dart room. You barley even notice it.,5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,1
I am def not a sound geek. I got it hooked up to my Samsung RU8000 and it's perfect for my condo. I play music on it via Amazon Music and it sounds great.

I liked the idea of a slim soundbar w/o amp but for optimal sound quality, I think an amp is needed.",3,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
Terrible purchase. First I ordered it and it didn't come with a remote. then I called Amazon and they sent another bar with a remote. Now the remote doesn't work after 5 hours of trying. Now I have to return two bars and an optical cord. Do not waste your money. Junk.,2,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
This product is awesome.  I replaced an older Samsung home theater system.  There was no comparison necessary.  The Bose soundbar blew the Samsung system totally out of the water.

My wife has hearing difficulties and jears music better than speech. We had a poll which was great but still have her problems listening to speech.

We've owned soundbars in the past...but none of them compare to this one.  It's compact and easy to set up.  The sound quality lives up to the Bose name.  If I had one down side...it's the remote.

Love it.  Not sure why others don’t like it but for $200 bucks I no it sounds pretty darn good.  I have a TCL Roku TV and I had to use code 2471 to get the universal remote synced up.  Plus you have to follow the sequence 3 or 4 times before it will sync.,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1
"This thing sounds great!  It's even better since mounting it to the TV with some VESA brackets (not included).  Before I had it sitting on top of a computer tower and the rubber feet stuck out over each side and weren't making contact.  I wasn't super impressed with the sound at this point, but it didn't occur to me that how I had placed it might be the issue.  I had always intended to mount it to the TV, and when I got around to that I noticed that the entire range of sound seemed more open, and the bass much more notable.  Perhaps the way it was placed dampened vibrations somewhere that they shouldn't have been dampened?  The bass is particularly impressive since the system lacks a discrete subwoofer.  The overall clarity is superb, and what I've come to expect from Bose over the years.  Disclaimer: I do not describe myself as an ""audiophile"" and make no grand claims about how discerning my ears are, so YMMV.  That said, I noticed the difference over my previous solution.  It has a nifty feature that boosts dialog, which works spookily well when watching video where the dialog is at 3 and the explosions/score/sound effects are at 11, and sounds pretty weird if you forget to turn it off and play some music ;)  The universal remote is solid and can be programmed to control most people's setups.  It gets loud enough to satisfy me, but if you are the type that likes to occasionally use the volume of your music as a weapon against your neighbors and the general public, it may fail to impress.  My goal was biggest sound in smallest footprint, and especially in this price range I think I did about as well as I can do.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",5,1,2018-1-6,1,4,0
"This sound bar hooked up easy.  I also programmed the remote with ease BUT, the sound coming out of the speaker was so quiet, we couldn't hear it.  After going through ALL of the trouble shooting steps, I returned it to Bose, who promptly sent it back with a note that they had updated the software. Unfortunately, there was no improvement.  I'm thankful returning items to Amazon is such an easy process.  :-)This would be an excellent sound bar if it worked with our TV.  The size is perfect & I love how ease the set-up was.",3,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
I purchased this product in 2018 and a few months after purchasing it stopped working and I'm sure if it was the remote or the soundbar itself. I then reached out to the support staff to either return the product or to get a refund and I've not heard anything from the company since 2018. I'm hoping that this will either get the company to get up off of their a##es and respect the warranty (and after market) option as well.,1,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"Great sound.  Bass is solid but not thumping like some would want (probably need a separate sub-woofer for that).  Great remote.  Very versatile and relatively easy to set up and use.  I use it to control the sound bar, the tv, the cable and a Blue- ray DVD player.  Good value for the price.  Revision:  after really understanding the controls, got very good bass response.  Maybe not up to hip hop standards, but solid. Still a great value for the price.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0

After confirming that power, power supply, & remote were OK I called Bosr tech support. $99 to repair & 3 week turnaround. I believe I’ll replace it with another manufacturer’s soundbar instead.",1,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
This is such a great sound bar for use in any room.  I have an open room into the kitchen and it is on full volume and doesn't disturb people in the other room.  The sound is very high quality.

"The speakers on our old TV were not very good and have been replaced once.  The sound was very garbled.  With this Bose speaker, every word is crystal clear.  I did have to change the option on the TV to use ONLY the external speaker and when I use the Spectrum TV cable remote, I have to keep switching back and forth between the AUX and CBL to change the volume or channels.  But that's a small price to pay for not having to replace the TV.  It still has a super picture and is a good size.

First let me say I'm a huge fan of Bose products. I had high hopes for this soundbar!. Sadly I was let down it seems like ordinary poor speakers in a box with none of the Bose Magic I had been familiar with. The volume enhancement comes from simply lowering the bass when deployed and the bass is weak as is so it led to overall mediocre sound. I returned it after two days! Big credit to Amazon for their return process truly the easiest thing I could do and my funds were back to me in 3 days! Nobody does it like Amazon!

The cable enclosed in the box was incompatible so I took a picture of the back of my television and the back of the sound bar and went to Best Buy. I was sold the right cable and hook up was easy. I hope this helps.  The sound bar is great,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"I got this sound bar because I got tired of all the wires from my surround sound system in the living room and it no longer played DVD so I only used it for the radio, I always loved BOSE since i purchased the little speaker, It was an easy set up with the Optical Digital cord ( I panick when it comes to setting up stuff) but EVEN I could do it, set up less than two minutes, and now I can hear the TV word for word without disturbing my neighbors with a loud TV! I LOVE IT!!!",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"The shows and movies my wife and I watch are basically dialogue driven. The sound system we had was better suited for action movies and music, sometimes the dialogue was difficult to make out. Turning the volume up only made it louder, not clearer. After reading the reviews on the Bose sound bar we figured we’d try it. The dialogue is crystal clear. Even at high volume it remains clear. Highly recommend it",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"Excellent price for Bose, a good value addition to our home entertainment. We use it for watching tv/movies, and it’s been great to use as a Bluetooth for our music from our phones too. The remote that comes with it is universal so that was a bonus to be able to link it to our other electronic devices and only have 1 remote, not just adding an extra remote. Was a very easy setup.",5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"Absolutely, positively, extremely UNimpressive, hardly better that the TV system. UNDERWHELMING in the extreme and the biggest, clumsiest HUGE remote ever seen, reminiscent of the 1960s remotes, ridiculous!!! Totally not worth the money, might end up as a door stop, altho its not even heavy enough for that. SAVE YOUR MONEY, bose is just trading on their name with junk like this thing!!",1,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0

I got this to hear Amazon Prime movies louder and better. Unfortunately I still can’t increase the volume using this sound bar because the sound originates from the computer. It sounds nice on cable tv but this didn’t fulfill the purpose of why I bought it.,5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"It was easy to install, sound was clear and crisp, the remote was to small and would not link to my cable remote.  Contacted Bose very  helpful but they could not link it. The only real complaint was the size of the remote way to small and hard to see buttons.",3,1,2019-1-14,1,1,0

"I have been shopping for a TV speaker to help regulate the sound coming from it.  I am always lowering or raising the volume.  This sound bar not only increases centralization of the sound, but also seems to reduce my constant changing.  Additionally, the sound has much more quality to it - seems fuller.

"I was not happy with the sound. I expected it to sound like many of their other products.  What it is EXCELLENT for is for folks that have a hard time hearing what the people in TV are saying as it has a special setting that makes the voices pop.

I have vision problems with small print (under 24 points) and dark surfaces like the remote.  The remote should have a light up mode so the functions can be easily seen.

Great product!",5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
Never got loud enough. We got this to supplement the tv sound so it would be louder but it never would get loud. The tv by itself was louder. We looked up everything to try and figure it out. Expected it to work better for the price. Had to return.,2,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0

Overall I wouldn't say I'm upset with my purchase but the price tag was a bit steep after having this for a month. I have another soundbar that was much cheaper and performs nearly as good as this one. You can definitely tell the difference when people speak though.,3,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0

Ok but really not wowed by the performance. It allows you to adjust the bass and it is incredibly lacking even at MAX. For just casual TV watching this could work but I was hoping for something with more impressive quality when playing music also. Will be returning.,2,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
The description says that you are able to hear the voices louder than the background noise.  I was a little doubtful but I purchased for my husband for his birthday.  I was pleasantly surprised that you could tell a difference.  I would recommend this sound bar to anyone who has a slight hearing problem.  I love Bose products.,5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
Sounds good even though it's smaller than the one it replaced. The dialogue feature is cool if you are used to keeping the sound relatively low. Makes the voices stand out. Works as good as you'd expect from a cutting edge company like Bose. I'd recommend it.,4,1,2020-7-26,1,1,0
The product is excellent.  Only issue was that the universal remote was not working all aspects because it was not compatible with our wi-fi box.

We have had the speaker for about six months.  When we turn it on it fails to respond to the remote.  The only way to remedy the situation is to unplug the speaker and reconnect.  This happens about one in five times we use the product.  It is frustratingIt is now March 2020.  The speaker will not turn off.  It used to turn itself off after a certain amount of time without receiving a signal.  I can't turn it off using the remote.  If I unplug it and plug it back in it returns to the on position.  For the price it is not worth it.,1,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0

A must buy and a definite recommend for anyone who is looking for a simple speaker that is a total purpose.,5,1,2018-3-7,1,0,0
I bought this sound bar for its ability to clarify dialog parts of TV programs. It does work on some programs but not all. I don’t use it every day.

There is no way of telling how high the volume is, and you just keep pressing the volume up thinking the sound is getting louder. There is no way to adjust any of the lows, miss, or highs. It comes with 3 presets, which again you cannot tell which one you are on for lack of a screen menu or small display. If I could I would return it for my money back. The product truly is a disappointment. I found a mich better system, that had better audio quality and a visible display for 100 less at the local Wal-Mart. If you are looking for that great audio experience this isn't it. If you are looking to improve your tv sound output, this is barely it.

We have an older TV with a stand on a surface that made all other sound bar and stands impossible due to dimensions. The Bose is small enough to fit between the feet of the stand. Disappointed at first with audio quality but it turned out to be a problem with trying to pass through the audio via the TV. Running the signal directly from the TiVo Mini to the Bose fixed it.

"I bought this item because it isn't as wide as most (it had to fit in a tight space) & has a built in woofer.  I have a few other Bose sound systems & they all work perfectly.The only complaint is there isn't a ""learning mode"" where you can setup the CATV remote to drive the TV, STB & the sound bar.  I have a Yamaha sound bar on another TV & it works seamlessly almost all the time.  In order to use this unit, I have to use the Bose supplied remote, which is different from the STB remotes on all my other TV's.  Additionally, the remote doesn't turn on/off all three devices all the time.  It might be a line-of-sight issue to be honest.",4,1,2018-1-24,1,0,0

"These new flat TVs have really lousy sound.  My husband and I aren't getting any younger, and he in particular has had trouble hearing the TV ever since our last tube type TV died.  So we've tried 4 different sound bars, none of which has satisfied us.We watch a lot of PBS and British TV, and the women's British accents have proven particularly difficult for him to hear (we have an LG TV).  This Bose sound bar has gone a long way toward solving that problem.  Additionally, with so many TV programs and movies these days having such a loud music soundtrack that it often muffle the voices, a problem that drives us both nuts.  This sound bar gives the voices more clarity than any other we've tried.  And, as others have mentioned, there is a button to raise the volume of the voices, and somewhat diminish the volume on the music.  It's the button on the remote which is between the volume button and channel up/down button, directly below the bass button, and has a cartoon dialogue balloon drawn on it.  You'll know when you hit the right button, because the power light on the sound bar goes from green to orange.  The only thing I wish I could change about this sound bar is I'd like for it to have some sort of indication as to how high the volume is turned up.  That wouldn't deduct more than 1/2 star from my rating.  Very easy to set up: just plug the included optical cord into the appropriate outlet on the TV, and then into the back of the sound bar, plus plug it into an outlet (I use a UPS to protect my TV, sound bar, cable box and DVD player).",5,1,2016-8-24,1,6,0

"Good solution for those, like me, who don't want a speaker array all over the room.  The clear voice feature is largely the reason I picked this device, and it works very well.  Dialog is much easier to hear clearly with the push of a single button.  I've never been disappointed with a Bose device, and this is no exception.  And a big bonus is the remote supplied with the Bose, it is easy to program to control TV, cable, and DVD player in addition to the sound bar.  Very satisfied with this device.",5,1,2016-10-2,1,2,0

"The sound is great on this, but it did not work when connected to the TV.  It had to be connected to the Direct TV receiver.  This took 4 different calls to Bose to figure that out.  But then the Bose display ads appeared on the bottom third of the screen and could not be turned off.  I made three additional calls to Bose on this issue, and all three said that because it wasn't connected to the TV, they could not do anything.  Direct TV said that because they were Bose display ads, they could no nothing (I tried 3 different times to see if a different person knew).  My last call was to Samsung who said it wasn't a TV issue.  So I had to return it.  I was really disappointed, because the size and sound was exactly what I was looking for.  And I can't help but think that turning off display ads was really easily fixable but I just didn't get anyone experienced enough who knew how to do it. Very frustrating.  But Amazon made the return very easy, so I am thankful for that.",3,1,2017-7-4,1,1,0

It amplifies my LG TV sound pretty good. I give it two stars because it seems to amplify the base way to much.

"Highly disappointed with Bose.  In general, they make decent overpriced products.  This time was a miss.  Its very small, not loud at all and there is not that much bass.  If your using in a small bedroom, its probably ok but do not expect a true soundbar experience if using in an open space or large room.  Of course if this thing cost 100 bucks, it would be worth it.  At 250, its criminal.",2,1,2017-11-30,1,2,0
"Sound quality is good but set up was a pain and still requires I use the Bose remote.  The instructions for setting up use by my cable remote didn't work.

This is a very good sound bar with plenty of bass. The Bluetooth feature is great and very easy to setup and configure. We mounted it outside on our back porch and it's so full that you would think a 5.1 system was playing even when the pool fountain is running. You cant go wrong with Bose as long as you use the correct component for the location. Well worth the money and beats running speaker wires and mounting multiple speaker boxes.,5,1,2017-11-3,1,1,0

"The soundbar is easy to hookup.  The sound is pretty rich and full, but the dialogue is not as crisp and clear as I was hoping.  Because I'm hard of hearing and don't understand a lot of voices on TV programs, that was the feature I was interested in.  I am returning this product and have since found ZVOX AccuVoice soundbar.  They use hearing aid technology to emphasize voices and reduce background noise.",3,1,2017-4-28,1,2,0

"I was able to compare it to Zvox, side by side. For clearest dialog, zvox is better. Also, the Bose remote is huge and awkward, its dialog light keeps returning to ""normal"" (a nuisance). No indicators for volume (unlike zvox, volume is displayed on the speaker). It feels very well made, and the general sound is decent. But if you are focused on dialog, I'd still go with zvox.",3,1,2018-2-22,1,1,0

"I have a 42"" Hisense TV that had no depth to the OEM sound. Bose is the industry standard for great sound, so I bought this bar without any reservations or real concerns.

"Works perfectly out of the box. Easy setup if you have an optical ""out"" from your TV (which is the only port I had left). You could also source the speaker directly out of your cable box if it has an optical port. The Bose comes with an optical cable.Sound quality is quite good, better than the (Vizio) TV speakers. Volume can be cranked up impressively if you're into that. The Bose ""voice enhancement"" button really does work . It seems to increase volume in the 100-200 Hz range and suppress some of the bass and high treble  frequencies, so conversations really stand out. This is a huge improvement, especially for movies and news shows. Another plus is that using the Bose does not cut off your TV speakers, so you can use them simultaneously if you like. It also allegedly Bluetooths to two devices but I haven't tried that.  And the thing looks good.On the downside: The only practical input to the Bose is optical. Your TV or cable box must have a free optical out or you won't be able to hook it up. It does also have a single coax input (e.g., RCA), but that won't help you much.  While the sound quality is good, overall  it is only about 10-20% better than the flat-panel TV sound (Vizio), EXCEPT that 1. Bose can go really loud without distortion and 2. the trick voice enhancement button is a real feature that works. The large remote control is supposed to be a ""universal"" that can be programmed to run not only the speaker but also your TV, Cable box, and DVD player. Good luck with that. The volume up/down control is very sluggish, probably because it works in ultra-fine increments that I can't detect.  Finally, the Bose speaker has no memory, so every time you turn it on, you have to re-set the sound volume you like and re-engage the ""voice"" button. A small annoyance.",4,1,2017-1-14,1,3,0

Hands down the best speaker system I've ever owned. There really is no reason to have separate surround sound speakers anymore. The sound experience is truly amazing. Reading about it does not do it justice. I love movies and watching tv with my family. This bose solo 5 sound bar is the best thing I've ever bought for myself. It is perfect just perfect.,5,1,2017-8-6,1,1,0
"My parents are getting up there in years and their hearing is fading. I purchased the Bose Sound Bar in hopes that they could better hear their programs. They have a 40"" Samsung flat screen and of course with the speaker being in the back the sound does not project forward so clearly. After going through the setup, which I may add was a breeze, and programming the universal remote for all of their devices , it was a success! They both commented what a difference. Bose products have it all together , thanks so much.",5,1,2016-12-29,1,1,0

"The sound quality is excellent for, say, the kitchen or bedrrom --- a huge improvement over the built-in speakers. It's a compact system, so expectations of surround-sound mega-rock are unreasonable.The Dialog feature is a noticeable boost --- my wife has some hearing impairment, and this clarifies high-end.

LOVE LOVE LOVE. My husband loved this gift for Christmas. We already had speakers set up in the basement from previous owner's.  My son and husband hooked this up Christmas Day and have enjoyed it every time they watched Football and we watched movies.  Came in handy during the Super Bowl when the Patriots were playing.  We are die hard New England fans for the Pats and Sox and the Bose sound system was awesome.  The sound is clear and it's easy to use and set up.,5,1,2017-2-11,1,1,0
"Wonderful,  super easy setup, great sound & affordable.  This my first big purchase from Amazon.com,  I took a chance, based on the fact I have Bose. In my truck & know the sound is very good. I didn't need to buy a bunch of equipment to replace what my ex took or worry about the correct cable for what he left. Just one cable from soundbar, to TV & one from soundbar to outlet & done.",5,1,2017-1-15,1,0,0

"Great sound system for the size and price. Although the bass does get a bit distorted at higher volumes. I also sort of regret not getting the Bose solo 15 as I feel that would've met my needs a bit better with its bigger size.

I bought Solo 5 about 2 weeks ago. I love the sound - but then it's Bose and I probably need not say much about it. Now that's out of the way - the set up was a breeze. Functions and controls are very intuitive - I did not even have to refer the manual. I love it that I can switch back and forth between the TV speaker and the soundbar very easily. Same for TV and blue tooth inputs. Last - I love the universal remote. It works really well with my Sony Bravia. I couldn't be happier with this buy.,5,1,2017-5-17,1,0,0
"I purchased this to hear dialogue betyer. Great sound!! Very high quality. Relatively easy setup thru cable box so I could use the optical preferring setup. Just wish there was now a surround Wireless addition I could add. If there is one on Amazon for the 500 soundbar , I do not see one.",4,1,2017-2-10,1,2,0
"This product is being hyped as being soooooo much better than the speakers that come with your flatscreen TV. That might be true if you have a really cheap TV. The $250 for these speakers would have been better spent on an upgrade when you bought that bargain at Walmart. Too late for that now, but maybe you can save up your money and buy a decent surround sound system at some place where you have a chance to hear it before plunking down those hard earned Benjamins.Thinking maybe I could salvage some use out of it, I hooked up the speakers to my Macbook Pro via Bluetooth. There is a problem with the connection being lost and cutting out frequently. Very annoying. However it has definitely better quality sound than the little squeakers you get with a laptop.",2,1,2016-6-23,1,6,0

We wanted something just to enhance the sound in the bedroom and it's awesome!  TV and game system sounds about 100 times better - and the dialogue option pushes forward speaking parts awesomely. For a lot of movies, maid to be played REALLY loud (e.g. Action movies) you have to blow out the sound to get the quiet whispering parts. Not anymore!  I am very happy with this. I don't know how it would have done for the living room, but I can tell you what show is on, even when I'm mowing the lawn, or making dinner ;). It's perfect.",5,1,2017-1-2,1,5,0

"Im not going to diss Bose because I love their stuff, but the reason I typically pay the extra money for Bose is for that ""Wow"" factor I always feel when I plug in something new from Bose. In this case, it was the first time I ever got a product from Bose where I set it up and I said to myself ""meh, it's ok"". So I prompt ordered the Bose Cinemate 15 which is only $100 more than the Soundbar. I plugged that one in and turned on the tv and within a couple seconds I said t myself, ""now that's more like it"".  Do yourself a favor, if you have the extra $100 most definitely skip the Soundbar and get the Cinemate 15.",3,1,2016-12-17,1,3,0

Lowend is nothing earth shattering, but then again it doesn't come with a sub. I have used with bose home theater as a center channel and it performed great.

"sounds good. bought it for the size and reputation. so much better than tv speakers, obviously. i was tiring of always changing the volume on the tv so i could hear dialogue. wish Bose sold a simple remote control option, on/off and volume is all you need.  these stupid universal remotes NEVER work properly, hence 4 stars.  i bought a Focal sound system last year for playing music in the kitchen which comes with a simple remote, it's awesome, it also sounds far superior than comparable bose.  very happy with this purchase anywaySo it's been a year now. And as I suspected the remote is junk. Why do Americans allow made in China junk to overwhelm our society. It's all garbage.  You have to get up  and unplug the speaker often  and even more often to just get mute button to respond. So sooo annoying. No highs, no lows, sound blows, must be  Bose. Go Sony.

I wanted to make sure that I had a great sound system to go with my new layout.  I decided on Bose because for years it has been a leader in quality speakers.  I am not disappointed!!  This little box packs a lot of sound.  The remote that comes with it is also really good.  Typically I hate the remote controls that come with these type of items (speakers, receivers, DVD players, etc...) but this remote is great, I programed it and use it for the TV, apple TV, DVD player, and the speaker system.The only reason that I gave the product 4 stars is because it connects to devices either with an optical audio cable or coaxial audio cable.  Clearly, optical audio is the way to go and is amazing.  However, my TV didn't have an optical output.  I know many systems that have an HDMI option, this would have been nice.  Fortunately, the speaker is connected to the receiver which has an optical audio connection.",4,1,2016-8-16,1,7,0

"Not bad.  Definitely better than the TV speakers.  It does deliver a clearer dialogue when set on ""dialogue"" mode, particularly on Network TV shows; now I have to rely less on the captions.  However, I don't think it does a great job on balancing (or down-sampling) a 5.1 channel signal to a 2.0.  ""We’ve all been there: the characters on screen are talking and it’s way too quiet so you crank up the volume only to be blasted by a loud explosion two seconds later.""*  So when you are watching a Blu Ray movie or streaming from Amazon this would happen only because the source (Amazon Video or a Blu Ray) is putting out a 5.1 channel signal thru a 2.0, which in this case is a Bose Solo 5.  I thought this product, as It was explained by the manufacturer, was going to do a good job on this issue, but it doesn't.  I still have to keep my finger on the volume and keep raising it up n down thru a 5.1 movie.  I'm still giving it 3 stars because it does a good job putting out a clear voice on the TV shows dialogues.*excerpt from article published by HTG ""Why the Dialogue is so quiet on my HDTV""",3,1,2016-10-11,1,1,0

"I have owned (and still do) many Bose products for over 30 years. From big to small, each product managed to exceed the expectations I had. Sadly, this is the first time I bought a Bose product that doesn't do that. Yes, it enhances the sound of my Samsung TV somewhat, but it lacks the warmth and depth that I've come to appreciate from even the smallest of Bose speakers such as the Soundlink. An enhancement on the TV speaker sound yes, but Bose listening enjoyment, no definitely not. Routing the sound over my old Bose Sounddock 2 actually sounds better.

"Great product with very good sound. Like most Bose products, you pay a premium for the name. Other sound bar options priced in the $150-$200 range will likely provide you an equivalent experience. What I particularly like about the Bose Solo 5 though compared to alternatives, is that dialogue/voices from shows are not drowned out by overbearing bass. Dialogue is crystal clear which was important to me based on what I'm using the Bose 5 for. I have mine setup in my basement mounted from the ceiling above our exercise equipment. Previously, I could have the volume on the television turned up almost to the max, and due to the noise from the treadmill while running on it, I still at times had difficulty hearing the tv. I wasn't looking for a bass heavy, thumping home theater solution. Rather, the Bose 5 sounds great and provides crystal clear dialogue with no lagging or static. It's a terrific speaker which I highly recommend!",5,1,2016-3-19,1,3,0
"This is the way a TV should sound! Clear, crisp balanced sound with adequate lows to get you through a movie. No more chasing the volume between chase scenes and dialogue.

They took care of the return and sent me a brand new one immediately, it was just a little disappointing considering it was a Bose product.Regarding the product it is great for the price.  The sound is clear when the volume is turned up, but it is definitely meant for a smaller room vs. a large family room. It was easy to install, simply plug in the cables where they belong and power.  The only thing I still need help with is getting the remote to sync with my other media players, such as my dvd, tv and cable box.

I got it yesterday and hooked it up, {which was very easy, BTW}  and I'd say it improved things about 50%. I was hoping for A LOT more base, but I guess you can only expect so much from tiny speakers in tiny enclosures.

Now the sound is from the soundbar and not the TV. The sound is much better however it doesn't resemble surround sound at all.

The sound quality is SUCH an improvement over what the tv came with that my 85 year old grandmother doesn't need her hearing aids anymore to hear the tv! With the Bose sound bar the bass tones and the dialogue is punched up just the right amount so that she can hear it, and I DON'T have to turn the sound up so loud that it's deafening to my 25 year old ears.",5,1,2017-5-8,1,2,0

This sounds like an alarm clock radio compared to the HTXT1, because the Bose has no built in sub woofer and the Sony does. The Sony also wins on looks (much more sleek, has an actual display for volume level and which mode you're in rather than just guessing at blinking lights), ease of use (the remote is much more streamlined and simple, less bulky as well), and functionality (sits under your TV rather than in front of it, won't block the sensor for the TV remote, it also has many more input options for cables).

"I was looking for a unit that would improve the audio quality of my TV while not having too big of a footprint in a small room. I tried out the Grace Digital TV Bluetooth Wireless Speaker which I liked for clarity, size and ease of use, but I found the amplifier was under-powered.  I also tried the ZVOX SoundBase 350 with AccuVoice which produced a more thrilling audio experience than the Grace and the enhanced voice option seemed OK, but it had a really big footprint. I finally bit the ""higher price"" bullet to try the Bose and do not regret the decision. The Bose has great sound, a good enhanced voice clarity option when needed, and its footprint is not overwhelming.  It even looks sleek and the remote control integrates with the TV and cable box. Instructions are thorough and setup relatively easy -- just have some patience in reading them to set up the universal remote control functions. Some reviewers complain about the lack of bass -- and it is lacking compared to the ZVOX -- but it is adequate for someone who lives in an apartment building with neighbors above and below.  The two nuisances I found were the receptacles for the power and optical audio input do not grip the plugs firmly, and the remote control is large, heavy, and complex.

"unless you want to use the Bose universal remote control. I just set this soundbar up yesterday afternoon. The set up was easy enough. Works OK, about equal to the Vizio I'm replacing. The problem is that I can not use my LG Smart TV remote to control the sound. I called customer service today (08/05/20)  and after a long wait and after explaining that I wanted to use the LG remote to control the sound I was told to call LG. I said that is crazy, Bose is selling a product that should work with hundreds of products. The customer service rep told me I was using unacceptable language. I said what , I can not say crazy? The phone call was terminated by Bose.Really? What kind of customer service is that? I have a Vizio soundbar on another identical LG tv and the connection was seamless. Bose is supposed to be a world leader. Why is it that Vizio can do the remote control sync seamlessly and Bose says to call LG. That is crazy. What kind of business model is Bose using? I should say that the Bose remote reminds me of something from the 1970's. It weighs at least twice that of the LG, maybe three times. I should also say that most all of my tv viewing is streaming. Bose does not give you a button for Nexflix or Prime. Bose does not have a Home button to select various streaming choices available so I'm forced to use the LG remote for tv functions and then the Bose remote for sound. Does that really sell in 2020? Really? Don't think so. Gotta send it back. What a waste of time, energy and resources. I re-read the Bose description and can not find anything saying that I must use their remote.

"After set up I could hardly get this thing to function.  After unplugging it for 5 minutes then re-plugging it in, it finally worked but I then noted the volume to be little more than that of my Bravia's built in speakers.  After more trouble shooting and altering my televisions settings I got the unit to function as I can only assume it's meant to.  The sounds were fairly crisps and yes, it did noticeably improve the quality and clarity of dialogue no matter what was happening on screen.  Later on, trying to use it again, the volume was once more lower than what my default television speakers could produce, and no prodding from me could get it to go back up in level.  The remote is an absolute nightmare, and often times will not perform the functions you intend.  There is a way to hold down two buttons simultaneously in order to sync the powering up of your television and the sound bar, and, conversely their shutting down.  I was only able to get this to function properly once, and I am a fairly technologically savvy guy.  This sounder is by far one of the least user friendly pieces of technology I've purchased in a long time, I will beyond any shadow of a doubt be taking it back.I do want to say though, that for the hour or so I got the unit to function as it should, that the results were very good and I'd have kept it had it kept functioning in subsequent use.  This thing though needs more prodding to work properly than a toddler to eat their veggies, and is far more temperamental. If you have a Sony Bravia, stay clear of this one.  Perhaps there are television sets out there which function more seamlessly, and for those I say go ahead and buy if what you want is clean audio.  This sounder is light on the bass and does not give that ""I'm at the theater"" experience that some others with subwoofers might.",2,0,2018-12-23,1,2,0
"I purchased this Bose Sound Bar for my bedroom tv. As with most newer tv's, the speakers on the tv are terrible. When I received my package, I opened the Amazon box only to find the Bose box was really dented in. I was really hoping that the Sound Bar was not dented as well, but it was. It has a dent on the top and front, right in the center of the Sound Bar. Since it is such as hassle for me to try to return it, I decided to go ahead and hook it up to see if it still would work, and it did, so hopefully the dent is just cosmetic. It is still very disappointing to pay that much for something new and it have a dent in it. Setup for the Sound Bar was simple.  I used the Optic Cable that was provided with it, to hook it up. The Sound Bar comes with a very nice and big Universal Remote Control. Using the Users Manual, I was able to pair my tv to the Universal Remote, so that I could control my tv with that remote, and I was also able to set it up so that the Sound Bar Power Button on the Bose Universal Remote could control both the power on the Sound Bar and my tv so that they would turn on or off at the same time when that button is pressed. I actually don't have satellite or cable tv anymore, all that I have hooked to this tv is a Roku Stick. I really didn't think that I would be able to control the Roku with the Universal Remote, but actually I figured out how to do it. By using the Navigation Pad on the Bose Universal Remote, I could use the ""OK"" button, the ""Arrow"" buttons, and the ""Exit"" button to control the Roku, so I don't have to use a separate remote control for it. As far as the sound quality of this Sound Bar, I do think it sounds really good. However, I own 3 Bose Soundtouch Speakers which all sound great, so I guess I was expecting this Sound Bar to sound just a little better, but it is definitely a big improvement over my tv speakers. The Dialogue button on the Universal Remote does seem to help make the voices stand out a little more and make them sound clearer. I do wish that the Bose Sound Bar had control buttons on it. Another Sound Bar that I have, the IR Sensor stopped working and the remote control no longer could control it, luckily it had buttons on the unit, so I'm still able to use it, so I really think that they should have put the control buttons on the Bose Unit as well. Overall, I do think it is a decent Sound Bar, especially for just my bedroom, although I'm not sure that I would recommend it for a larger room or for my main living room tv.",4,0,2018-7-4,1,2,0
"This Soundbar was 1St released on Amazon on February 21, 2016, yet 4 years later December 25, 2019 I am not able to even Program the ''Universal Remote'' to accept my NEW Sony X950G 55''.  It accepts NONE of the codes. I was 'gifted' this item - however I picked it, and although it was for the Speaker the ''Awesome'' looking remote was a large factor. I figured I would use it as my TV remote - which is the REASON for the remote itself being a Universal remote ''to take over your TV remote so you don't have to use 2-3 Remotes. But NOPE BOSE stuck us all on that one.  If it was not for my TV being so advanced I would not have been able to use the BOSE 5 via Blutooth on my Television. I may have this item returned if I cannot finally figure out the Universal remote. Such a shame BECAUSE one of the most beautiful remotes I've ever seen and can't even us it besides VOL UP/DOWN (and Power OFF). Another drawback is - there is no output Headphone Jack - I thought there was - because there is a 3.5mm Headphone Jack on the back. But Nope BOSE stuck us all on that one too. If I have any updates to this problem I will include an update - as of NOW i have tried at least 8 legitimate Code and ''no dice''. If your looking for a Soundbar and are looking at this think again. I hope BOSE loses a million dollars because of this ''SOLO'' review.  If BOSE is that far behind in TECH they ''can't'' adapt to products released 4 years later, then that's also a shame. I may have to have this gift returned. Merry X-Mas.",1,0,2019-12-25,1,2,0
"Just purchased this Bose sound bar.  I also just bought a 65"" Smart Vizio t.v. for my basement and wanted something small that attaches to the wall and gives me some dynomite sound.  The sound is noticably better!  With the Bose system, it is compact, but delivers a great sound. It is easy to hook up. One cable is for the electrical outlet and the included optical cable connects to the T.V. and that's it.  I weas also able to program the volume on my Directv remote so i dont always have to use the Bose remote.  As others have mentioned, the addition to the dialog feature makes TV programs much easier to hear. I'm 56 and my hearing in my right ear is crappy. I love concerts and sports and I have found with the ballgames, hockey games etc. you can really hear that ""pop"" of the glove when the ball hits it and the crack of the stick when they shoot the puck.  I am also using it to stream Grateful Dead, Rolling Stones, etc. through Youtube. The Concerts sound is really good.  I got the bracket for $15 at Abt so I could attach it to the wall as the picture indicates.  The bluetooth works great as well as I use my Ipod and phone with it. My only complaints, and they're minor ones, are I wish the sound was a little louder when I really want to crank a concert and the bass feature doesn't seem to add much additional bass when I activate it on the remote.  I just don't notice much difference. Perhaps I'm not doing it right. Overall the Bose quality shines and for $250, I'm set for the foreseeable future.Update July 18- Had same issue earlier reviewer had, after 2.5 months the power wouldn't stay on, took it in under warranty  and it has been fixed so far.

"I watch a lot of superhero/action movies and TV shows, often late at night, and they tend to flip between quiet dialog and very loud explosions or other sound effects. I was having to adjust the volume up to hear the dialog, and then scramble to turn it down again so I wouldn't blast my poor neighbors out of bed, and that gets really annoying really fast.  My old TV had a max volume option that sort of solved the problem, but not this one, so I finally decided to see if I could solve the problem.This sound bar does a great job of it. It has a ""dialog"" button on the remote that, near as I can tell, boosts the treble and minimizes the bass, so I can use ""dialog"" for television but leave it in regular if I'm streaming music (which I do from my phone via the Bluetooth feature, and it works really well except sometimes Spotify forgets the sound bar and I have to find the device again). I'm not a sound connoisseur by any stretch, and I'm sure someone looking for fantastic surround or who has a very refined audio palate would prefer something fancier, but this is easy to set up and works beautifully.",5,0,2019-1-4,1,1,0
"We ordered this for the LG Smart TV in our bedroom.  We were frustrated with the sound quality on the TV.  Music was so loud, it was hard to hear conversations.

For the price, this is a great little soundbar.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because there is no Home button on the remote.  We still need our TV remote to access apps on our LG TV (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.).  Once we've opened the app, we only need the universal remote that comes with the speaker.  This may not affect you, if you don't have an LG Smart TV.  Overall, this soundbar is great for smaller rooms that want big sound.",4,0,2020-1-8,1,1,0

I have trouble hearing and needed a speaker that can amplify dialogue. This speaker states that it does but what they give you is a clunky remote where you need to turn on dialogue mode every time you turn on the soundbar or if it goes idle. Extra steps for absolutely no reason. Another reviewer said if enough people complain about it Bose will make a patch for it to fix the problem to make the system remember your settings.There's also no way to see what volume level you are at. You can turn it up and down and there is no visual indicator on the TV showing what level/number volume you are at. Seriously?,1,0,2019-6-24,1,1,0

"I previously had an LG soundbar which cost $150. Oddly enough, it sounded absolutely terrific. So what am I going on about? Well that soundbar had a wireless subwoofer which constantly interfered with my wifi, so I wanted something without a wireless sub. I regret leaving behind my LG's soooo much.If you back off the lack of sub, something you already know you're giving up with the Solo 5, the Bose speakers lack the ability to fill the room with sound. I live in a small apartment, and yet it still doesn't seem to provide kick. The speakers sound.... small. Which is an identity you tend not to attach to Bose. The company has a history of making small speakers sound bigger than their size would suggest. If you stand about 3 feet away, the sound is appropriate but as soon as you're 5 or more feet they start to really loose an audio luster that I can't properly articulate. Are they better than the TV speakers? Yes. Perhaps a lot if you can sit relatively close to them. But are they worth $199? Not to a lot of people.",3,0,2020-5-24,1,0,0

Not overblown in the slightest, even at a surprisingly high setting, the bass only presents itself when necessary. If there's a low voice, this unit does a fine job of not letting that bleed into the really subby bass frequencies, which I definitely appreciate. The simple and QUICK Bluetooth connectivity is amazing as well.",5,0,2019-11-7,1,1,0

Sadly I can't recommend this product when anything else out there sounds better. Pass on this product and get something else or if you must have Bose, go for the 300 system I believe it's called.

No hoops to jump though. I went and plugged it into my tv...omg instantly worked. Do not buy Bose its just a name and the sound would be good if the product could actually, universally connect to anything it plugs into. It does not.

I Owne  a pair of Computer speakers,  headphones a portable speaker and now the sound bar, I did not purchase it through Amazon because I needed to get it in payments so Qvc facilitated that. however I feel that so far the sound bar has change the way my TV sounds And even the music that I play from my Echo Dot. The remote is a bit bigger and has too many buttons but so far I am getting the hang of using it and it does provide you with many things to connect with so that’s another upside. In my view other sound bars have Good sound however sometimes you can’t hear what is going on in the TV shows or movies you’re trying to watch so this Bose  sound bar really truly helps, especially with the dialogue mode. i’m very glad I purchased this sound bar I don’t need anything crazy even though I would love a ton of speakers because like I said to a blind person sound is everything but so far I Recommend  this sound bar.",5,0,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"This sound bar ONLY ALLOWS ONE INPUT to be played at a time. i.e. you cannot switch inputs from lets say optical in ( from a cable box )  to the orange digital coax in ( from a separate DVD player ).  Bose really screwed up the design on this one.  All you would  have to have in an INPUT selector button on the remote to switch between inputs on the back of the Bose Sound Bar.  Overall sound quality is good.  However, after discovering this flaw, I bought a ZVOX 203 which DOES allow you to switch between the inputs on the back of their SOUND BAR.  Bose customer support is also really bad, not like the old company which Amar Bose started.  Stay away from BOSE.",1,0,2019-12-20,1,2,0
"First off,be aware of the purpose of a sound bar..which is basically upgrading your t.v. speakers.. not a surround sound system. It's like having a receiver with mid level front left,right and center channel speakers only except it's all in one sound bar. It creates just enough bass to get by and be able to hear those subtle bass tones like a car door slamming or music in a dramatic scene or the rumble of a good explosion that you definitely won't hear with your tv speakers. I have both surround sound and this soundbar hooked up to my TV and I chose to use the sound bar because it's much more energy efficient and sounds great (but of coarse surround sound is better) I got this for $100 renewed from Bose and it came looking and packed like brand new and for me,it is worth every penny.If you don't have a surround system and you just want your television speakers juiced up by about 1000% then look no further. You couldn't have an easier way to get a good, cheap sound enhancement. And it's Bose!! You can't barely get a pair of Bose headphones for that money! Shop around,renewed units come with a one year warranty apposed to a 3 month warranty and the added $80 cost of a brand new unit.",5,0,2020-4-29,1,0,0

It's hard to turn it on and you don't know if it's the system's problem or the remote control's battery is dead. For two years I have had a number of times that I have to unplug the system and reconnect it, change the battery to keep it going. Now it's totally dead can't be turned on anymore and I have no idea if it's the remote control or system itself is dead.

"Considering what I paid for this, and the brand name it carries I expected far more. The store has it set up to impress, creating a sound mecca where the consumer stands no more than a few feet from the speaker & between the tv & a wall for the sound to magnify off of. This sales texhnique definitely props up the sound quality to an impression it cannot live up to.The plug & play was a very nice simple setup with a handy universal remote.  In my opinion this speaker was decidedly underwhelming. It added little more to the basic speakers when plugged into our Samsung 55"" flat screen. It lacks depth and clarity.

After calling Bose, to get some assistance, I was told that it was manufactured in May 2017 and the warranty was over in August 2018. In other words, The warranty was based on time of manufacturing not when I got it. Even still I only used it for a year and three months before it conked out. Bose offered to repair it for $99 plus tax. Seems like a scam. Looking online, it seems a lot of people have had this issue on ones from 2017.I grew up with a Bose speaker and it’s still going after 20 years, so I’m assuming they’ve lost their quality.

"This is an awesome sound bar for the price and compact size! I’ve been using this for awhile and it's changed my total tv experience. The sound is so much impressive than the sound from standard tv speakers. The voices are easily recognized and bass is impressive for such a tiny soundbar. Also, the sound is pseudo surround sound, so movies are impressive for such a small package. It won’t rival any true surround sound systems, but it's really in the same market either. The boom of the bass is what blew me away initially as there is no separate subwoofer. I don’t know how Bose did it, but it's quite impressive. I also like the multitude of inputs like toslink, digital coaxial and 3.5mm aux which is great for connecting multiple sources. Also, the bluetooth feature is great and easy to connect and makes it very convenient to play room-filling music from your smartphone. The universal remote works well and I’m able to control other devices like the tv, however, it doesn’t seem compatible with my ps3 or roku stick, but that’s ok.Overall, this is a highly recommended soundbar for your tv that will easily upgrade your listening experience. Also, it’s versatile so that you can play music from your bluetooth devices. All in all, I can’t really find any faults with this and am pleasantly pleased with this product from Bose!",5,0,2016-12-17,1,0,0
Like all Bose products I’ve ever owned this speaker sounds excellent and is built like a tank. The setup was very easy. The remote works well with both my tv and cable/TiVo box. I usually take a while to get used to a new remote but within a day or two this one felt good. Overall I’m very satisfied with my purchase and barring any unforeseen problems would recommend this to anyone looking for sound bar especially if you are looking for one with clearer dialogue with this I was able to turn CC off and can hear everything.

I can't express how disappointed I am with the sound of this sound bar. The quality is decent but it isn't very loud and I don't feel the sound is any better than the speakers on my TV. There is very little bass, the indicator lights are hard to see and use, and for what this thing cost my wife  would have been better buying a Sony sound bar with a subwoofer from Best Buy for less money.

"I was shocked to hear how tinny and flat the sound quality of this Bose sound bar was. Originally at at around $300, I would expect this sound bar to punch a bit better than the Bose SoundLink. But the Bose Solo 5 ended up sounding like a cheap $50 budget sound bar. There are no redeeming qualities of this soundbar for this price point ans especially for a Bose product. This speaker is notorious for lacking any quality bass but the mids and highs are just so tinny and sound as if the sound is being run through a tunnel. The sound quality of my amazon Echo out performs the Bose Solo 5. I honestly believe there are better sounding speakers you can find on amazon for $50 or lower.The material quality is also not what I expected out of Bose. The speaker is surprisingly light and feels mostly hollow. Nothing about this speaker makes any sense. I feel like my order was somehow switch with a poorly make Chinese fake.

Above the red input, it says ""coaxiel"",  have you ever seen a coaxiel cable screw into an old fashioned audio output? Rhetorical question. They dont. I figured I would try it anyway. So, I went out of my way and seperately bought both a coaxiel cable and I also bought a red/white composite audio cable, neither worked.

Most of the TV shows we watch have low dialogue sounds and very high volumed music or commercials which cause us to constantly have to adjust volume to keep from disturbing our apartment neighbors... this sound bar completely corrected this!  it has a special feature which stabalizes the lows and highs and keeps all sounds at a constant level (if that is your desire like it was for us)..  Also features a Bass boost.  Gives surround sound from one bar verses a whole speaker setup.. smaller bar fit nicely without being too bulky or too long.  Also, very easy setup!  I am a woman and setup the sound bar and universal remote in less than 20 minutes!  Sound bar comes with a optical audio cable, but the manual shows alternate hookups if your TV does not have this jack available for hookup.  A guide with codes comes with the Universal Remote to link all of your devices... was able to setup our Insignia TV, Apple TV box, Sony BluRay and a bluetooth device all on the universal remote within minutes!",5,0,2016-3-25,1,3,0
"Purchased through a big box store about three months ago.  After moving to a new home with a larger, more open living room, it became apparent that my TVs built in speakers just weren't cutting it anymore.  After reading reviews, I settled on this Bose system.  All I can say is it's worth every penny.  Just make sure you select the dialogue button if you struggle with voices.",5,0,2018-12-7,1,0,0
"First of all I think some of the lower rating reviews are crazy, this is a Sub $300 soundbar so people really need to keep expectations real.At this price point I was going to give this 5 stars because I like the voice clarity feature so much, but it's really hard not to judge the lack of bass in the speakers and include that in the review. Yes I know it has no sub-woofer, but I have heard sound bars in this price range with much better bass that also had no sub-woofer.  Overall for the price and small footprint this is a really great addition to a typical 42-50"" flat screen TV and it will knock the socks off of any TV's built in speakers but it's not really a high end unit so don't expect the same sound quality you would get from an $800+ soundbar.",4,0,2016-4-13,1,2,0

"I didn't buy this product through Amazon, but like to share my opinion. I bought Solo 5 mainly to work with my MBP and Surface Pro for my home office. Its perfect compact size for putting under my 27 inch LG 4k monitor. It connects to my both laptops, iPhones and iPad smoothly and flawlessly through Bluetooth. I do have better speakers for my TVs, but Solo 5 does provide balanced sounds with an option to adjust the bass which sounds great in my office.I would recommend it to anyone to use it in the office, bedroom, or kitchen.

There is also a dialogue button that is great for nighttime viewing or if your hard of hearing, in this mode it lowers the bass and increases the highs and mids. All those people who can't seem to get it to work just read the manual, very simple.Keep your expectations in check as this system won't replace a high end 5.1 system.

Next I used Bose universal remote and connected it to my Samsung TV and to my Direct TV box. If you read the directions and the codes given, by Bose, that was about a minute. So in a minute and a half I was completely up and running. As for the sound; it comes pretty amazing with the presets. I did however press the ""dialogue button"" and boom; instant difference. The book also shows you how to change the bass as well.My ONLY negative feedback is that the device doesn't show you what volume level you are at. Other than that minor detail.....this thing rocks!!! Another note to the negative review; a sound bar should be instead of your tv sound and is not to be used with your tv sound.

The Bose system lacks bass and volume levels that we are used to experiencing.  Our living room is about 17x17 so maybe the Bose would work in a smaller room.

"My current TV has the speakers in the back and this made it difficult to hear most things. I was also tired of the sound jumping up and down. For instance, I couldn't hear people talking very well so I would turn the volume up and then action would happen and it was too loud. This seemed to be happening frequently and I was constantly being asked by the family to turn the volume up or down. To solve the problem I bought this Bose 5. I've always wanted a Bose speaker system because of the quality and amazing sound they produce even with smaller systems. This Bose 5 is no different, I fell in love with it within the first 5 minutes.The sound is great, the dialog option is great, it looks great and the remote is awesome. Unlike some of the other people who reviewed this I had no issues hooking it up and programing the remote. It even came with a separate booklet just for codes to program the remote, I've never seen that before! I have my DVR, TV, X-Box One, and phone all programed in the remote. One push of the power button turns the TV, DVR, and Bose 5 on or off. One push of the Bluetooth button connects to my phone to stream music. But it also comes with an option in setup to where the Bose, while turned off, can detect if sound is coming through a device it is hooked up to and will automatically turn on. And will also turn off after a period of time if there is no sound. Say I turn everything on with the remote that came with my Cable company's DVR and I don't have the Bose programed in that remote.

"The Bose Solo 5 Sound System has a solid sound, although I like how my older Onkyo [http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EE18LPM] performs better, probably due to its larger size. The Bose bar is nice and slim and can be wall-mounted (as an additional purchase). The set-up is easy, although the optical cable is short (as they all seem to be) so it can't be positioned how I'd like it to be. I had the most trouble with the remote and it took some doing to get everything to work properly. I'm usually pretty good with those things, so I don't know if I was having an off day with it or if Bose just made it more difficult. Eventually I figured it out (mostly) and am able to change bass and other settings. I'm keeping my Onkyo connected to the TV and using the Bose for Blu-Tooth, which I had zero problems syncing with my devices. Still, hearing about how great Bose sound is, I am disappointed.

I had two previous Bose products, the QC25 headphones and the sound dock from 2009, both were incredible products but this was just underwhelming.I stacked the speakers on top of each other and played the same songs to compare and the Samsung K450 blew away the Bose Solo 5, got completely boat raced, wasn't even a competition. My Samsung I purchased on sale after Black Friday for $150 and the Bose retails do $250, I found it at Costco for $220 and thought I was getting a steal, I wasn't.

"I've never been one to care if my TV shows and movies had sound clarity, surround sound, etc.  However, now that I have sleek Bose Solo 5 TV Sound System for my TV, I can definitely hear the difference.  Yes, it's one more thing to turn on (in addition to the TV itself, the cable box, etc.), but the sound level is from a different realm than even my Smart TV provides.  It was pretty easy to set up; just plug and play (and change the sound export in settings).  This sound system also comes with a universal remote, so I can attach my TV, cable box, DVD player, etc. to it.  I'm still working out the kinks, but it's getting there!  I already have one Bose sound system to play my music via bluetooth, but it's in another room, so now I have another option for listening.  Again, it was pretty easy to connect via bluetooth and play music from my apps.I've only found a couple of minor negatives about the sound system.  First, when sitting in front of my TV on the shelf that my TV is on, it blocks the remote sensor for my TV (to turn it off/on, activate the Smart TV mode, etc.).  After seeing the photos on here, I think I'll try to hang it on the wall behind/above the TV instead to take it out of the way.  Second, when I'm turning the volume up or down, I don't see the sound level number on the TV like I used to with the TV's sound.",5,0,2016-3-21,1,4,0

"Bought this to replace my samsung tv's poorly sounding downward facing stereo speakers and was only marginally impressed.  There is a improvement of sound quality, but for what you pay it's a poor value.  This soundbar is good for dialog, I'll give it that, but lacks bass and does not do a great job simulating surround sound. I would have bumped this up one more star if it had a line out so I could connect an external subwoofer but sadly it lacks the capability.  I returned this soundbar and went the next step up to the Bose Solo 15 which while better than the Solo 5, was even more disappointing for the price.I finally settled on a ZVOX 670 which I picked up for $369 and it's not even close, ditch the bose and take a look at what ZVOX has to offer.  The ZVOX has 5 tweeters vs the solo 5's 2 tweeters and also includes 3 5 inch downward facing subwoofers for LOUD base.  Now the ZVOX is a sound base, not a sound bar so I had to put the TV on top of it but it looks much better in my opinion (unless you are going to wall mount the soundbar).  The ZVOX has a line out for a sub (not needed though) and 2 digital inputs.  They have cheaper models and also soundbars if you don't want a base but I would highly recommend them instead of bose.",2,0,2016-12-24,1,1,0

"The Bose sound bar is a good entry level system.  If you have a newer TV that is slim, chances are you have weak built in speakers as well.  That is the trade off for form.  This sound bar is basic, and only projects sound directly in front.  You cannot simulate surround sound with it.  It has a dialogue function, which I found works very well when watching loud action movies.  The way it works is you hit the button on the remote and the bass gets turned down.There is no sub woofer, and the sound bar is the only equipment that you get, besides the remote.  There is no HDMI pass through, so you either have to use optical, or AV.  You can also use it as a Bluetooth speaker, and that is what I mainly use it for.  It is simple to pair, and requires no password.  You simply hit the pair button on the remote and connect it via your device.  Music came out nice, loud and clear.  It is also small, so looks oddly out of proportion next to a 55 inch or larger TV.",4,0,2016-3-25,1,6,0

When it works, the sound is exceptional.  That being said, the positive of a sound bar over these systems is that the setup is a snap, and you don't have speakers all over your living room.  The soundbar is a whole lot neater (and I'm happy to be rid of my huge subwoofer, to be honest).  A lot of TV only utilizes two channels anyway, so a sound bar is ok for that.

"This is an attractive, unobtrusive bar speaker with a great sound! It has a wide range of sound. The bass gives me chills. I am not skilled with technology, but I had this plugged in and set up in a few minutes. The TV sound is noticeably better.

"I love this sound system! I have a Samsung Smart TV, and, while I love the TV picture, the sound quality is not that great. Plus, TV shows and movies seem intent on making things difficult, with commercials at max volume, background music too loud, and voices too soft. This bar fixed all that. It is simple to install and set up, and the sound quality is fantastic. Voices are now clearer, and it seems to even out the volume so that background music actually stays in the background. I'm no longer constantly playing with volume control.This system is Blue-Tooth enabled, so I can also use it with my laptop. It's super convenient. Once paired, it's just a matter of turning on the system when I want to play something from my laptop. While the sound quality for music isn't quite as good as the Bose I have on my stereo system, it is still excellent.",5,0,2016-3-26,1,7,0

"I wanted to love this sound bar...  Never have I owned a Bose speaker system (except for the one that comes pre-wired in our vehicles), and I have always believed that you were paying for the name rather than quality.  After using this bar for the last three weeks, I am saddened to report that my opinion has not changed.There are three different inputs available on the sound bar- OPTICAL, CO AUX and AUX.  We have the speaker connected to our 50 inch LG LED television in our bedroom.  The living room already has a receiver and 7.1 speaker set-up.  Unfortunately, the BOSE does not have an included subwoofer, nor does it come with mounting bracket.  This is an unnecessary extra cost that one may need to take into consideration.",3,0,2016-4-7,1,1,0

"Ha! Don’t even have one but you guys almost had me. That 224 price is unbeatable sure, but the name is extremely misleading. Bose 5? Sweet. But it’s actually only a 2.1 surround. Only 2x 2 1/2 drivers. Should be called the Bose 2.5. And the little footnote that reads “no returns”. Oh yea, definitely makes me want to get one. 👎🏼 2 stars is generous",2,0,2018-3-22,1,0,0

"I replaced a 38 inch VIZIO soundbar with the Solo 5 and it was measurably superior in every way imaginable.  It was very easy to hook up, and I really loved the feature whereby you can program the soundbar to come on as soon as detects a sound signal.  It was also easy to pair to both iOS and Android devices.  It met every expectation I had in a Bose product in terms of sound quality--it is amazing.  My only issue is that they provide a full size universal remote, but I actually found this to be a lot more straightforward than trying to track the led display on the front of our old soundbar to choose the source.  It was also easy to program to the TV and the cable box we had on the TV, and can turn on all three at once with the remote.  Very happy thus far, and works perfectly in the medium-sized room we're using it in.",5,0,2016-3-16,1,1,0

"Don't waste your money on this awful product.  I have FIOS and it's impossible to use your FIOS remote to control the volume.  I spent hours on the phone with both BOSE and VERIZON.  If you have any problems and call BOSE you talk to people in the Philippines who can't speak english and barely know the products..  Then if you're really lucky you get transferred to someone in the USA.  I did that, and that person sent me on a wild goose chase to upgrade the software on the unit.  Nothing he told me to do worked.  Total Junk!  If you're smart you will only buy SONOS products.  That's what I finally decided to do.",1,0,2017-5-5,1,2,0

"For what it is (a simple single speaker) it is a strong 5.  Is it clear?  Yes.  Is it loud enough? Yes.  Can you hear some bass?  Yes.  Is it simple?  Yes.  If you want simplicity this is it.  It is all plastic and weighty.  No fabric mesh to get dusty.  It's fun.  If you listen critically then you find it is a bit constricted, forward, no low subwoofer heartbeat thumps, lacks super high dynamic range.  But for everyday listening to music and video, it is all you need.  If you have a movie room you should get at least a 2.1 or have separates with an amp.  But for everyday listening with no sound modes, except for a bass adjustment (which is marginal at best) and a dialogue mode (compresses the vocal range), this will suffice.  If you have kids running around or are near a kitchen, this is absolutely all you need.  Bose has only 2 high quality full range speakers inside.  You will not feel surround sound, but occasionally hear sound bounce left and right.  More like sound is coming from the TV.  I've mostly stayed away from Bose because there are so many other options out there at lower cost, but this has been a pleasant surprise.  The midtones are almost perfect if a little forward and tight.  It may get smoother over time.  What do you expect- only two full range drivers centrally located.  My Lg 751 system plays wider and deeper and my Nakamichi system has some surround trickery and is even more powerful, but none of this matters everyday.  Some people say use an amp with 2 stereo speakers.  You will not turn on an amp to just listen an everyday basketball game or an online video.  Some tiny processing is needed for videos.  You just turn on this Bose and listen.",5,0,2017-12-1,1,0,0
"I purchased this sound bar at Best Buy for the same price (was feeling the instant gratification type mood). I've only had this sound bar for a day. The sound quality is great. I find the bass to be good but not overwhelming, which is exactly what I was looking for. I have a condo (576 square feet to give you an idea) and the sound fills my entire living space. The ease of usage is incredible, and the extra universal remote was a nice added bonus ($50.00 value!). It took me about five minutes to sync the remote to my TV.",4,0,2019-3-8,1,0,0

"My wife had it out of the box and set up in a couple of minutes. Just plug it in, turn it on, all is good.

Sound is good for a small to medium room, base is not window rattling, but it is perfect for movies, and games. Also it will pair Bluetooth concurrently with other media devices, and it will remember 8 devices at a time. A little pricey, maybe but it is hefty, and feels solid just what to expect from BOSE. I read other reviews that complained about the sound popping from time to time. We had that at first until we fully snapped the Optical cable in till it clicked.

This speaker i have been hunting for a long time. Was waiting for the price to fall down. As this product is no more available in the stores of Bose the only medium is ecomm. Since the product is phaed out i dont know why they still price it so high. NeverthelessI got the product when it came down for a day. Post buy the experience is awesome and connected my TV output to it. Sound clarity is superb and better when you wanting voice to be heard more clearly. Though it has some bass but acceptable as i dont like too much bass.,5,1,2019-5-5,0,7,0
"Bose is reputed. No second thoughts.However the packaging could be improvised comparing to revo (like multiple end adaptations for sockets with only one cabling), more value could be added if only aux cables and digital cables be provided in lieu of the multiple power cables, plus the wall mount can be provided within that same packing making it complete.",5,1,2018-12-27,0,6,0

HD channels) and streaming services (FireStick for ex.) work well as advertised. I have connected my set-top box via optical out and it works flawlessly so far.The universal remote is handy and is currently being used to control my Tata Sky set-top box, a 10+ year old Sony Bravia Tv and the Firestick device ( this indirectly via the TV HDMI sync option) .",4,1,2019-10-28,0,1,0

Finished paying this off with amazons payment plans. Had it for a few months. I love this sound bar. It’s perfect for small - medium maybe even large living rooms. You don’t need a subwoofer, if your in an apartment or condo it gets really loud and the bass is great. You’ll piss off your neighbors. Subwoofer would be great for a small theatre.

"Me gustó apesar de que vi varios reviews que le criticaban su falta de bajo y potencia, pero realmente para mi es suficiente en mi caso es un cuarto de 5x5 mts y suena excelente sus medios y agudos solamente el bajo queda un poquito a desear pero realmente mejoró el sonido de mi Tv Samsung 55"" 4k con 2 bocinas de 20 watts rms, simplemente fue un cambio de triple de potencia y fidelidad sino esque más, tiene un tamaño ni chico ni grande con un buen diseño y es muy sencilla de instalar y usar.En resumen si buscas buena marca excelente sonido con un bajo/subwoofer de mediano nivel para un cuarto no muy grande, no dudes en comprarla no te arrepentiras a mi me costo $3600 mxn y definitivamente NO es para una fiesta que para eso hay MUCHAS otras opciones y a mejor precio como mi Diamond Boxx",4,1,2019-12-24,0,0,0
Bose needs to improve packaging for sure .. there were 6 types of power adapter wires in the package to be able to fit all sorts of plugs across the world .. if they just had sense they could have thrown in a component cable which would be more useful and reduce to only one EU type cable. Nowadays every one has adapters ...so silly of bose.Bass is not very deep but sound is loud enough for a 12x12 room .. its directional so in front of the speaker the effect is best.,4,1,2019-11-29,0,0,0

"Got this on a very good discount during the Prime sale for less than 14K so it's definitely worth the price. The sound quality is good but I've heard better and possibly I had expected better from Bose. I'm using the recommended settings with optical cable connector. Top end volume performance is better in equivalent speakers from brands such as JBL. The sound is best directly in front of the speaker but loses out when being heard from the sides (in a room about 25x25 feet).

"I am sharing my experience which might help you..I wanted to buy a good sound system to beat the boredom during this lockdown. I considered boat 160w, jbl 2.0, Samsung n300,Sony RT models etc..I know all are different prices but the issue is all about a compact music system which gives 100 percent satisfaction for your investment . I don't like seperate woofers as they are not portable and gives you a heavy feeling and one bad woofer can collapse your music system and also only single soundbar doesn't give you a good theatrical  experience.. I was confused but I went for bose during the sale.I can say that bose solo is close to 85 percent of what wow is.. Universal remote is just too good. Bluetooth is brilliant.. Bass is Perfect but slightly low for big rooms... Sound is excellent.. It's a good buy for 12.9 k.. It's worth your money.. Just go for it if you got the money . It's a great experience for me..",4,1,2020-8-7,0,1,1
"Esperaba más potencia. De que mejora el audio lo mejora por q la television al máximo volumen se distorsiona un poco y la barra no se distorsiona pero tampoco es el gran sonido sin embargo es aceptable. Lo que si me gusta es q con elcontrol al oír música puedes avanzar o retrocede la canción. Otro punto q no me agradó es que los graves se activan por 5 segundos únicamente, sin embargo los de por defecto suenan mejor que la tv. En mi caso que no quería que retumbara mi cuarto ni ocupara mucho espacio esta bien.

Kinda Okay for the money you spent if you are looking that thump bass, but if you are looking for a decent sound with all the mix then it's a go for it product. you can experience and distinguish every beat. unlike the soundbar 500, 700 setup it's kinda plug n play so it almost connects to everything.",4,1,2019-11-13,0,1,0

Any further sound expansion on TV will be an over kill. Bose Solo is just a right sounding speaker with right level of Bass. The quality of voice and detailing of small notes can be an enthralling experience.

"Update:  at almost 2 years to the day of purchase, this unit just stopped working. I did all the trouble shooting steps and nothing works. I called Bose and they offered to fix it for $150.  I asked about taking it somewhere locally and the woman dropped the price of the repair to $55...  She did it so fast - I said little - that I almost felt that they built them to crap out after the warranty!  She didn’t try to do much trouble shooting because I told her I tried all the stuff they suggested online, so I really felt like her role was to sell me a repair. While it worked, it was great, but I’d suggest something getting something else!  I bought a new power supply to see if that was the issue, but it isn't.

Using it since one month.. I have an earlier experience of Bose products as i have two Soundtouch 10 bluetooth speakers and I can guarantee what Bose can offer.. It sounds amazing.. recommend for small to medium room.. if someone is looking for bluetooth speaker of Bose.. go for Solo 5 as it has bluetooth connectivity (to pair your phone) and it sounds better when compared to Bose Soundtouch 10.. plus it has a capability of connection with you TV via optical cable which Soundtouch 10 lacks.. ensure your TV has a Optical out for better clarity as Bose advises/ prefers optical cable only (you will get optical cable inside the box as accessory).. however it has AUX cable connectvity also..Base is good enough and you will definitely love watching movies over Solo 5.. sound clarity mind blowing..,4,1,2019-12-5,0,0,0

"This little sound bar was great for the first three months. But it has stopped working altogether now -  it won’t even turn on. BOSE has a good reputation, but this item did not live up to its name.",1,1,2018-2-20,0,8,0
"En cuanto llegó la soundbar a mi casa la abrí con todo el cuidado y dedicación del mundo, la conecté y probé mediante Bluetooth y mi primera impresió fue: la tengo que devolver, suena como si fuera una grabadora (de esas de los 90's). Salí a comparar un par de soundbars a un Liverpool. Regresando, opté por darle una segunda oportunidad a la barra y la conecté mediante cable óptico a mi pantalla y ¡Oh sopresa! el sonido era nitido, los bajos bastante discretos pero ad hoc para mi habitación.Decidí leer el manual y en las primeras hojas tienes la solución a todos tus problemas, y ahí se lee la forma de aumentar o disminuir la potencia del bajo. Fue hasta ahí que me di cuenta que esta soundbar le hace justicia a la marca: es ideal para habitaciones y espacios cerrados (aún no la pruebo al aire libre, porque si, se puede llevar a la interperie y utilizarla como bocina).",5,1,2017-11-22,0,5,0

Bose solo 5 soundbar provides ample clarity in dialogues and very good soundstage although one cannot expect it to replace a good 5.1 HT system.,4,1,2017-12-26,0,7,0
"Easy to set up. Turns on automatically every time.But it doesn't have the best sound ever. I certainly see a difference between my TV speakers and this one, but it's not dramatic. It might be a bit overpriced for what it is.",3,1,2017-10-10,0,5,0
Great sound. Much improvement over the internal TV speakers. But the universal remote is not easy to use. Buttons and layout are too close and poorly positioned on the unit (my Telus box remote is MUCH better). Plus have to have the other main remotes to hand when the programming drops,4,1,2016-5-21,0,2,0
"Awesome little speaker - bought it as I had a cheap little sound bar and in my old(er) age, my hearing isn't what it used to be.  This unit puts out wonderful crisp clear sounds and I can actually hear the voices of people on tv :)  Easy to set up, looks great and being able to use the remote for the tv, cable box, dvd etc is perfect.",5,1,2017-7-18,0,2,0
Feels overpriced for what it brings. I live in an appartment and needed something with low bass and clear voice. DOES sound better then my integrated speaker on my 4K TV but not that much.I like the Blutooth options and is very easy to set up.,4,1,2016-10-16,0,1,0
"Sound is not much better than my Samsung UN55KU6290 TV.  Can't get the universal remote to work fully - doesn't work with YouTube (FF/REW, etc.).  Also, couldn't program the remote to work with my IPTV box (Infomir).Would've kept it if the cost was ~C$100.",2,1,2017-2-22,0,3,0

Bought this for just 14500 . You might not get this price again on Amazon even during Festive season but even at 18k this is a good one to have . It is a good sound bar for a 150-200 sqft room. For big rooms you might have to buy the higher version of sound bar from Bose. Sound clarity is good. Set up is super easy. Dialogue mode is a good addition. The universal remote makes other remote controls useless.Go for it but wait for price to come down. At 22k it's a bit high priced. 18k-19k would be an ideal price to go for. Looks are good simple. You can also connect the bar to your phone using Bluetooth and play your music on it.,5,1,2018-8-22,0,1,0
"I've read some reviews with negative comments to the remote, auto wake, power, bass, etc. This unit just sounds incredible. People need to realize that yes, it is bose, but it's also less than $250. It has plenty of power (especially for only two speakers), full sound, and a small amount of bass especially over the tv speakers for not having a sub. As for the technical things, the detailed manual is your friend.",5,1,2017-6-27,0,1,0
I have not found the sound quality of this product to be up to typical Bose standards. The sound is very flat and I have to turn the volume up very high to hear. I have used other Bose products in the past and have been very impressed. My living room is not huge (apprx 20'x15') yet the sound is not impressive.I feel I got what I paid for and should have spent some extra money on a Sonos.,1,1,2016-11-25,0,1,0
"This replaced a Visio soundbar and woofer that just could not easily fit in with our current TV set up. This little Bose unit is the perfect size and, with the exception of the extreme lower register, we don't miss the woofer at all. Great sound quality, good volume range, and when needed the ""speech"" feature works very well.I might have been tempted to award 5 stars but I cannot for the life of me get the auto-wake feature to work with the result that I always have to remember to turn the sound bar on manually.",4,1,2017-5-9,0,6,0
"Two stars isa little generous, but the sound quality is ok. Everyone who wrote reviews stated how great the bass is and how it sounds like you've got a surround sound system. It is not and it does not. The bass sucks, is no better than the Bose soundlink speaker I have. It doesn't really sound much different than my tv speakers, maybe just a little clearer. Quite disappointed being Bose, am returning it to Amazon for a refund. (The bass adjustment button barely does anything)",2,1,2018-1-13,0,5,0
"The sound on this speaker has good base and a well rounded warm tone overall. There are only a few connection options, ideally you want to use your optical cable on your TV as it works best. The only thing I feel they screwed up on was the remote - it's confusing and they intend you to replace your other remotes with it but there's no way I would. I still don't know how to change audio inputs on it, it tries to auto detect which input you might want to use and fails miserably at that.",3,1,2017-3-1,0,4,0

"No highs no lows equals to bose. The product has only two speakers in a big shell. I have used many Bose products earlier. Out of all those, this one takes the crown for being the worst of all. It will give you better sound than your TV speakers but not at all what you expect from a 22k speaker. It supports Dolby audio but the sound output doesn't make you feel like that. It's not the true sound at all. Bose asks you to buy a woofer separately with this to feel the base which again is very expensive. This product has no base output. Lastly, for a price tag of 22K, many other brands such as Sony or JBL are making much better products. Choose wisely!",2,1,2018-5-18,0,2,0

"I have a small (32"") Samsung flat screen tv that, needless to say has very poor sound.  I bought that size TV to fit in a wooden cabinet that was made for an old model, non flat screen tv.  I needed a sound bar to improve the sound that also fit in this cabinet.  The Bose Solo 5 fit the bill perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  It is really hard to find something in this size range, but best of all, the sound is better than I expected for such a small unit.  I should mention that I am hearing impaired and wear hearing aids in both ears. I often have trouble understanding dialogue from TV speakers and even some Sound Surround 5.1 systems give me trouble.  The Bose Solo 5, however, provides very clear voice recognition, even without using their dedicated voice mode. If you have a small TV and want to improve the sound using a small sound bar,  I highly recommend the Bose Solo 5.",5,1,2016-7-25,0,9,0
"I have gone through many feedback before I chose this, some were positive and some were negative. First point on Amazon delivery, it was before time (as usual from amazon) delivery. 😀Installation was too easy and the best part is the universal remote (configured with your TV, cable/satellite TV, DVD - Awesome). Now on performance, one simple line, ""With this price, you cant get better than this"". When you are watching movies, you feel like you are watching in theater. Agree, the Bass is not so deep but after adjustment it sounds much more better. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and works properly without any break. It sounds real good with detailing, each bit of music is crystal clear and dialogue mode is awesome. After connecting with your TV, the difference can be easily feel by anyone.",5,1,2017-5-24,0,2,0

"Superb sound, in a reasonable price this is an amazing product. High Bass superb sound and dialogue mode is superb. can be connected to any BT device, coaxial cable, Aux cable and most impressively Optical cable. Remote is working well with TV and Dish TV. overall this is another superb product from BOSE",5,1,2017-3-11,0,2,0

"The product is simply incredible,awesome. I am sorry but don't have better words to describe. Its far more than enough for my 150 sq. ft. hall. At this price point, this Bose product serves beyond expectations. Be it music, movies or any thing else it takes care of all the aesthetics associated. Size of this unit is another wonder. Truly appreciate the guys at Bose. Its giving a new dimension to the sound.",5,1,2016-12-16,0,7,0

"A big rounded sound, it gives depth to even basic music that comes out of underpowered TV speakers. The universal remote is a cracker. Additionally the Bluetooth allows me to pair and play music from other devices. Definitely worth the money I shelled out.",5,1,2017-4-18,0,6,0

Haven't rated any product till date cause most have worked well or weren't worth it even if they didn't. Bought this speaker as I had been thinking of buying a Bose speaker since a long time. Wanted to start with the cheapest option. Must say that the speaker sounded  really good till one day it started crackling beyond a certain volume level after couple of months. Ruined my expectations and feel cheated for the amount of money i paid. This review is one and half year after the purchase date but i thought let others know before they take the decision,1,1,2018-6-6,0,3,0
"Please don't buy this one, total disappointment, this is definitely not Bose standard. A second rate market speaker performs better. I didn't believe when some folks here said this was not worth buying and went ahead to buy this to just lose 22k of my money.",1,1,2017-11-9,0,1,0

Better sound through research indeed ! This sound bar is a powerhouse performer for enhancing your TV viewing experience. And the dialogue mode makes the clear enunciations clearer. Acoustics- check! Volume- check! Deep bass- check! Do not expect anything more than a sound bar. This is for well rounded tv and general music listening purpose. Bass is deep and immersive. Loud is louder. Leaves you bonded with it's quality !,5,1,2017-9-9,0,4,0
Amazing sound. Ordered this reading various reviews and fully satisfied with the product. Connected with my TV with 3.5mm to RCA cable & play songs wirelessly through my phone. Enough for my living room of ~200sqft.,5,1,2017-1-1,0,5,0

"Una barra de sonido que cueste tanto para su tamaño y sonido es esta, si, tiene sonido claro pero es bajo en relación a lo que esperas, el control es extremadamente grande, dos controles de esos hacen el tamaño de la bocina, la bocina es buena a secas y si quieres pagar la marca, esta a tu opción, pero realmente estoy arrepentido de comprarla y la devolveré, apenas me llegó hoy y se va mañana seguramente.",3,1,2018-6-10,0,4,1

Great speakers. Loud enough for my smallish drawing room. I stay in a hsg society so can't have the bass reverberations of a sub-woofer. Would recommend to anyone wanting small form loudspeakers for their HDTV and for watching sitting right in front of the tv.,5,1,2016-7-23,0,1,0

"I understood well English-language programs in my computer, but it was never clear in my TV even with new Sony led TV. I was excited with my new TV purchase that i can watch all the videos from TV. The sound was not clear again; disappointed. From my browsing I understood that this sound quality loss is due to back mounted speakers in today's led TVs. Then I came across 'Bose Solo 5 Soundbar and purchased.The sound quality is amazing. It made watch TV again.",5,1,2017-3-2,0,8,0
"A big let down. Did not think twice before buying as it is a BOSE and assumed that it will live up to its reputation. Not worth the price....bought it and returned it the same day. I have a basic samsung led and the tv speakers had better output in terms of sound quality and volume as compared to the bose. Dont know what pushed BOSE to lower their quality. Better buy a philips soundbar in the Rs.10,000 price bracket which has a better output and sound quality, provides a woofer and is half the price.",1,1,2016-8-30,0,3,0
Brought this product with hudge enthusiasm but when I checked the quality it was disgusting no subwoofer feeling.  sound quality was OK we aspects lot from bose. So recommend to bose close this product from market so that customer will keep their faith on bose.,1,1,2017-1-16,0,1,0
