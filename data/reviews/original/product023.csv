We have a small house and didn’t need a 5.1 system for better sound.We have a TCL 55” 4K set and plugged this into the HDMI/ARC port on the TV.  This allowed the TV remote to control the volume.  The remote included with the sound bar is only used to switch between the Movie and News modes when we’re not watching something that needs to be loud.,5,1,2020-2-18,1,1,0
"1. Has 2 red, & a white, a green, and a a blue array of status lights.  They ware way too small and way to dim to be seen when viewing the tv.  One must walk right up to the device in a dimly lit room to really see what is going on.  The rule for lights to be noticed but not intrusive or distracting is that they must be very bright, very small, and must shine out from the bottom of a black pit, like a locomotive about to emerge from a railroad tunnel.2. The remote is way, way too small to be handy; fine for Barbie & Ken, but not for the rest of us.  Requires 2 hands to use the bottom row of buttons.  Also it gets lost on my messy coffee table. Similar in size for the remote to my outdoor security light, but that one is OK as I use it maybe once a month; this one gets used a lot in one evening; controls volume, muting, mode, on/off, etc.  Again, the rule for remotes for this duty cycle is that they be no smaller than a ROKU remote.  Also the projected beam is very, very narrow.  Barbie & Ken will need a 4 power rifle telescopic sight to aim it properly.",3,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"I purchased the Alto 7 2.0 with built in subwoofer TS7000 for my TCL - 43""  4K UHD TV model 43S525 using the HDMI ARC output connector. It was very easy to setup and program to my TCL Remote and my Cox Cable remote by enabling the CEC Control instruction in the manual. The Sound difference is major under the movie mode while watching the football game it was just like being there. I would HIGHTLY RECOMMEND buying only a TCL Alto soundbar for your TCL 4K UHD TV. I did try a non TCL brand soundbar and I had to return it due to either no sound and so difficult to set up",5,1,2019-11-4,1,2,0
"I own 2 TCL smart TVs and have loved them since day 1, with the weakest part of them being their built in speakers. When I saw TCL made a sound bar with wireless subwoofer, I had to try it out. So far I am loving the set. Setup and install was super fast. Just unpack and plug in via the included HDMI cord and the HDMI Arc and you are ready to rock and roll. I love that my original TCL Roku remote controls the volume on the sound bar so unless I want to switch the audio mode, no need for the included remote. I have also connected my phone via bluetooth and that worked perfectly as well. In terms of audio performance, I'm no audiophile, but this thing delivers. Our living room is a decent size and the sound and volume output is great. For the price, I am super satisfied and would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple plug and play sound bar to upgrade their stock tv speakers. Is this a Bose surround sound system, no, but does it sound great and provide good quality for an amazing price, heck yeah!!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I Purchased the TCL Alto 7 without the separate subwoofer. I have this connected through HDMI ARC on my TCL Roku TV. I knew that because this only had a built-in subwoofer, lows weren't going to be amazing, but that's not my complaint. For the first time for any speaker I've purchased, the highs are basically non-existent. It's like this sound bar can only produce mids. Vocals sound muffled and overall sound is comparable to some built-in TV speakers. Yes, this is an upgrade over my TCL TV speakers, but you could get better highs out of $10 speakers. This soundbar is absolutely not worth $80.I've tried the 3 different equalizer presets and I don't hear much of a difference.",2,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0
We had to move our stereo that the TV was hooked up to so I got this sound bar. Its mounted on the wall under the TV so I didn't want a wired sub-woofer. The Sub-woofer sits under a chair. While its not a booming surround sound it gives a much richer sound then the TV but itself and has some nice bass that you won't get from just a soundbar. Plus I like that it goes to sleep then automatically turns on when sound goes into it.,5,1,2019-11-13,1,2,0
I had a professional installer with 29 yrs of experience try to set this up for me. What should have been a 20 minute job to mount and install ended up taking him 45 -60 minutes and he still could not get it to work with the TCL TV I have.  TCL customer service is an absolute joke. They are difficult to understand and they repeat themselves over and over. The installer packed it back in the box for me and I plan to return ASAP,1,1,2020-3-14,1,2,0
"I bought this soundbar to use with a TCL 43S425 TV. It does block the TV's remote sensor, but comes with an IR passthrough cable so that is a non-issue. The soundbar works well enough as all I really wanted was front-facing sound. My father uses the TV and is starting to have hearing issues so I wanted the sound playing toward him to prevent him from turning the volume up on the rear-facing TV speakers all the time.The only thing I couldn't figure out is if the soundbar could be used with bluetooth headphones. The instructions are not very clear on bluetooth functionality. It seems the only way to connect via bluetooth (other than the wireless subwoofer which connects automatically) is by connecting from another device like a smartphone. I don't know how well or if it would work at all to connect both the soundbar and wireless headphones via bluetooth as I just don't want to get into anything that complicated.",4,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"This unit does not seem to cooperate with our Sony smart TV using the HDMI ARC connection. It will play sound after a series of turning on and off to convince the TV it is connected and on, but every time the TV is turned off and we come back to it, we have to go through the same routine of turning on and off multiple times to get the TV to switch from internal to external speaker mode. We will attempt another connection method to see it it resolves the issue, but wasn’t necessary with our last, Vizio unit connected in the same way (soundbar issue, not a TV issue).",3,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"Bought one of these only a few months ago. From the beginning, I would sometimes inexplicably have issues with playing music from my iPad via Bluetooth. Sometimes the music would be horribly garbled. There was no apparent rhyme or reason—putting the iPad right next to it didn’t help.Things went downhill from there. Every so often, the subwoofer would get out of sync and create an echo. I would have to unplug and plug back in to fix, sometimes multiple times.",1,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
"If you have this soundbar connected to a TCL Roku TV, go the the TCL website and download the software update, which you can install via USB on the soundbar.  This will make the Roku TV remote's mute button functional (mine didn't work until I installed the update).  It will also give you the ability to enable/disable the soundbar's auto standby feature.  Be sure to select the correct update for your particular soundbar.  My piddly complaints would be that the soundbar remote is small, feels flimsy, and is easy to misplace.  It would also be nice to see the volume level onscreen.  But most of all, an auto sound leveling feature would be nice since commercials tend to blast in at a higher sound level.  Other than that, it's a very good soundbar with a rich bass response and clear sound. Use the three buttons on the bottom of the remote to change the bass level.",4,1,2020-2-14,1,3,0
"I bought this soundbar as a gift for my father however I am seriously considering getting another soundbar for him as the great quality of the sound didn’t break my bank. The soundbar came with all of the accessories needed for installation including the wall mount. The design is sleek black and modern and is low enough to not block my TVs IR reader but even if it did, this soundbar has an IR passthrough allowing you to access your tv THROUGH the bar! I am very happy with this bar and will definitely be back!",5,1,2019-4-22,1,3,0
"I've only had these speakers for 24 hours so this is an early impression. I plugged the soundbar into my TCL Roku TV using the provided optical cable, powered bothsoundbar and subwoofer, and it worked. Someone commented the volume on the Alto 7 could not be controlled if you used the optical cable, but I can assure you, you can. I paired with my phone and played music for hours today as well.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,3,0
"Love this sound bar the 7.1+ Alto 2.1Sound is great for us 60+er’s that like good sound without the need to blow out the windows and doors. The sub woofer blue tooth's nicely to the sound bar. The sound bar is wired by HDMI to the tv and has its own 110v power supply. It has an IR cord too which I guess is for your sound bar remote, and an optical cord as well which I haven’t a clue what it’s for so I didn’t install it. I mounted it below the tv so I’ve got 3 wires/ cables showing slightly between tv and sound bar. If you mount it above your tv you can conceal them better. The TCL tv recognizes the sound bar and is easy to make them work together. The remote has music mode, movie mode and news mode which is fabulous! Highly recommend! This unit is a must to really enjoy your big tv!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,2,0
The sound is flat. The TV speakers sound better. Wish I had not bought this.,1,1,2019-4-28,1,8,0
"Nice soundbar with thumping bass from the subwoofer. It has plenty of volume and power for our use. The sound is full-bodied but would like to have a bit crisper higher sound to make voices easier to understand. The remote is pretty flimsy and small. I am concerned it will get broken or lost easily. Thankfully, the remote for the TCL Roku TV works for the volume of the soundbar and I can keep the soundbar remote on the sideline. The Toslink cable didn't want to fit into a splitter so I had to use a different cable to connect the splitter that came from the TV. Pairs easily with Bluetooth devices, but keeping the remote stowed away means manual switching at the soundbar. Would be nice to have the soundbar work off of third party remotes. While the Roku TV remote can control the sound for the TV and soundbar, third party remotes can only be programmed for the TV and don't work with the soundbar. Oh well.",3,1,2020-1-12,1,2,0
"I reviewed several different TV soundbars that ranged from $100 to $1,500 and based on all those reviews, I was swayed to the TCL Alto 7 in part because I have a TCL Roku TV and others said the integration was seamless and in part because TCL emailed me a 15% discount coupon for the Alto series 5/7 which just clinched the deal.  The sound quality is so much better than what the 55"" TCL 6 Series Roku TV has for native speakers; no surprise based on other reviews I had read.  The included remote control is rarely needed, but it has power, mute, volume controls, a source selection (and a hot-key for selecting Bluetooth input) as well as three EQ presets for music, movie, or news.  I tend to leave it on the ""movie"" EQ preset for everything based on a review I read on PC Magazine and confirmed by some personal experimentation.  I only use the soundbar remote to wake up the unit if it goes to standby because no sound was played for a long period (maybe 15 min or so), but the TV was on; otherwise I use the Roku TV remote for volume/mute and it works fine (my soundbar is connected vie the HDMI ARC for integrated control).  My two very minor nits are that:  a) the native TV speakers increment/decrement by 1 step when you increase/decrease volume via the TV remote and the soundbar seems to jump by 3-4, so there's less fine control over the volume; and b) the bass sub-woofer doesn't have an independent volume control.  I initially thought the sub-woofer wasn't working even though the blue LED on the back panel indicated it was--when I turned up the volume pretty high (past 35) I started to hear something out of the sub-woofer.  I understand that an earlier version of the Alto was too boomy during movies and this is likely TCL swinging too far the other way to address that complaint.  An independent sub-woofer volume control would be the ideal solution, but overall it's still a great sound quality for the price.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,2,0
"In an effort to make these devices more streamline, they've made them too small to add speakers of a decent size.  It talks about ""full range speakers"" when in effect you get a bunch of tweeters and the system relies on a passive sub-woofer to provide the bass, which is does very poorly.  The sound was tinny, not any better than the horrible speakers built into my LG TV.The pros, such as they are, were that it was extremely easy to setup, remote worked very well, the bluetooth pairing was extremely simple and instructions for setting the TV digital output were very helpful.  Volume was beyond anything you would actually need.  Maybe a true equalizer capability would have helped, versus the there presets you are given.  A powered sub would have made a difference as well, passive is just not efficient.",2,1,2020-7-6,1,1,0
"The product gets 4 stars. In my case there is an annoying but nowhere near fatal flaw. After lengthy usage, sometimes when the video is paused, when it resumes the audio is scratchy and awful. The fix is to turn the soundbar off and back on. Pointed this out to support but they weren't much help. It's no big deal really. Haven't heard about this phenom anywhere else.And the subwoofer, which is a nice extra, is mostly designed to get us over the fence to buy I suspect. It's not much of a subwoofer in action I'm afraid. I wouldn't count on it to rock the house. Thing is, most would probably have bought anyway, woof or not. The sound is everything you'd want in a soundbar and for the money you really can't go wrong.",4,1,2019-12-24,1,2,0
"I have had a number of major problems with this product, even when it is paired with a new TCL 6 series TV (65R617) which I thought would allow it to integrate smoothly.By far the most annoying problem is the 1-2 second lag between the video and audio when connected via HDMI ARC. The other inputs don't appear to work any differently, and obviously the presence of HDMI ARC and ability to control the combination with 1 remote was a major selling point. I contacted TCL who attempted to be helpful and quickly sent me a firmware upgrade/update, but these changes had no impact on the problem. If audio sync issues are bothersome to you the persistence of this problem makes the product unusable.",1,1,2019-7-13,1,1,0
"Just bought the 65R617 TV, and I bought this sounds bar the day it came out to go with it... I really, really wanted to love this soundbar, but it just isn't there yet. The sound continuously fluctuated during every show and movie we watched (from all sources), and it just wasn't worth the price. Constantly having to adjust the volume for no reason gets really old, really fast. Sound quality was nothing to write home about, either. Hopefully TCL can fix this.",1,1,2019-5-24,1,2,0
I originally bought a Bose 5 Solo sound bar because Bose is the best right?? Think again! I got a 55in TCL Tv and originally passed over this product because I thought tv brand can’t be as good as Bose.. boy was I wrong!Long review of why this is better than Bose 5.0 for those who care to compare. For those just wanting my response to this product skip to last paragraph.,5,1,2019-5-29,1,1,0
"Liked it so much....I bought another one. I purchased one earlier in the year, for a TCL tv in another location. Hooks up nice with the TCL tv....I have an older (2011) Samsung 3D tv where Iam now....thought it would improve the sound here (I don't have good hearing). I find myself not watching CC with the bar. Has very good base (separate woofer). Contrary to the very few - reviews I read, it is simple to hook up. I use the digital optical cable supplied, and have had no issues. My phone's bluetooth hooks right up....I listen to Pandora through the soundbar....it sounds great....Comes with all cables needed....a remote control....manual and quick start guide (which is easy to understand)....and hardware to place the bar on a wall. I bought this one through Amazon warehouse, used....and it is as brand new! Was repackaged to the hilt....Anyway....I would recommend this to anyone....even less tech savvy people....just follow the instructions....You can do it!",5,1,2019-10-25,1,1,1
"I have looked at sound bars for years, and just felt like…nah…I don’t really need it, the TV sounds good enough.  I have a TCL TV and a couple Insignia TVs – and the sound is good…but there is no going back after the Alto Sound Bar.  The difference is incredible.  The sound bar arrived in a couple days from Amazon, was incredibly simple to set up, and looks great.  I was able to tuck the sound bar behind the TV, and you can’t even tell it’s there.  The subwoofer, I was surprised how great it sounds for being wireless…as good as a wired subwoofer I have in another room.  The ability to use my phone, and play music is an added bonus.  I put a TCL TV in a sunroom addition, it was not wired for cable, so the TCL Roku TV has been in there for a couple years.  But to play music…I had to turn the TV on, and use an app (or bring a small portable speaker)….now I just use the Alto Sound Bar – and it sounds great.  The subwoofer… with music…you forget how great some bass sounds.  I didn’t listen to an Alto w/o a subwoofer (saw it first at Best Buy, but was on a motorcycle and could buy it)– but if you are torn between the 2 versions…I strongly recommend the subwoofer.  It is small, tucks in next to the couch, no wire (just power cord) and makes a huge difference.  I haven’t tried it with a non-TCL TV, but the sound bar came with multiple ways to connect to TVs and should have no problem.  The bonus w/a TCL TV is you use the one TV remote and it controls the volume/power for both.  The Alto sound bar remote is small and simple.  Nice job TCL.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,1,1
"There are a couple ways to connect this sound bar to a TCL Roku TV.  If you use the headphones cable to connect the TCL roku tv and the sound bar, you can use the Roku TV remote to control the volume and see the volume indicator on the television. If you use the optical cable then you need to use separate remotes and you wont have a volume indicator. The  Roku Tv remote will not toggle the sound bar on or off though.Works and sounds great even with the headphone cable attached.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,1,0
"Read other reviews about the bar not being controlled by Roku remote and such but in my case that's untrue. I have a TCL P605 TV and have the soundbar hooked up via optical output. After hooking everything up make sure you press the appropriate output on the provided soundbar remote, in my case optical. I pushed my volume down to 0 (zero) via Roku remote and raised it to 5. Adjusted the volume via the remote provide with soundbar and raised via Roku to 10 and adjusted again. I'm sure you can skip 5 or 10 but this was my first time playing with such settings. After you've fine tuned your volume simply put the soundbar remote away and power off TV. When you power on TV again simply push the up volume on your Roku remote and the soundbar should power on. I'd wait until the LED (orange in my case) is lit before adjusting sound anymore. Also, with the P605 I had to raise the TV so the IR and visibility was better.",3,1,2019-5-21,1,1,0
"This review is for the 7.1 system. I waited a long time for this to become available, as I was not sure what other products would work with the quite limited Roku remote that my 65"" TCL Roku TV came with. Setup was easy using the ARC HDMI port - simply plug and play. The TV was already setup to switch over when the sound bar was detected. This VASTLY improves the sound quality compared to the rather sad stock TV speakers, especially for just plain old TV or Movie watching. Volume control using the original Roku remote is almost flawless, though there has been 1 or 2 times when the Sound Bar simply has not turned on with the TV. Bluetooth works well, and the unit pairs quickly when turned on using its own remote or with a button press on the unit itself.Sound quality is Acceptable, as mentioned its vastly better then the TV itself. The sub-woofer is only a 6"" unit, though it has an attractive and easily hidden cabinet, and the wireless functionally is good.",4,1,2020-1-14,1,1,0

"Be careful! TCL sells this with their 50S425 television and the combo does not work. Because of the speaker height , if you place the sound bar in front of the TV you will not be able to use the TV remote - it blocks the line of sight to the sensor on the TV. Alternatively, if you place the sound bar behind the TV you will not be able to use the sound bar remote because the TV blocks the sensor on the sound bar. Very poor combination by TCL.",3,1,2019-8-13,1,4,0
"Really wanted to have the Alto 7+ soundbar to complete my sound setup.  I guess I won't since the main reason was to use the remote on my 55"" TCL tv to control the soundbar and with no signal coming from the HDMI ARC connection,  I am returning the unit.  Didn't have time to determine how it sounds so I'll have to pass on that.  I spent almost an hour and a half with tech support.  Exhausted every setting without getting the HDMI ARC connection to work. Disappointed.  Revised to 4 stars - would have been 5 if it had better equalization feature.  Found out it was the tv with the HDMI ARC problem.  Contacted TCL Support.  They stayed with me to troubleshoot the soundbar and offer help to resolve the tv issue.  The optic connection works great so decided to just use the included remote to control volume.  The unit was easy to setup and operate.  It has enough versatility to handle all my sound needs. Nice unit.",4,1,2019-9-5,1,2,0
"I bought this as a combo to go with a 50"" TCL TV. Having owned a 55"" for a couple of years now, I know the built in TV speakers are pretty bad, so I wanted to improve upon that.This soundbar does sound good out of the box. I would prefer the ability to do some tweaks (treble/bass/etc) but none of that is available. It's good enough for a bedroom, but nothing like the quality you'd want in a home theater.",3,1,2019-4-30,1,2,0
"This is my first soundbar purchase ever and overall I can say this is a great budget soundbar. The sound quality doesn't blow me away like a Bose might but the TCL is definitely and upgrade from the built in speakers in my 55in LG 4K TV. The soundbar itself is very clear providing good middle and high frequency response. I have it connected to the TV using HDMI ARC. My TV recognized this and automatically configured the output itself. My Roku remote is now able to from the Roku stick, TV power and the soundbar volume. The subwoofer has good low frequency sound quality as well but is a little quieter that I myself would of wanted but it does give that level of depth to the sound that built in the speakers lack. I have my tv hung on the wall and used some soundbar brackets from Mounting Dream to hang it from the tv which worked out great!",5,1,2020-7-11,1,6,1
"Really disappointed with this sound bar. Bought it to go with the 2018 TLC Roku Smart Tv... the speakers on the tv work much better than the sound bar, and it really doesn’t get very loud. The “home theater” aspect of it is an absolute joke.",1,1,2019-6-6,1,1,0
"A sound bar from the same manufacturer as the TV it's connected to ought to work seamlessly. That is, as if it were built into the TV. That's why I bought this one, and not one made by AwesomeKickassSpeaker Company. I should never have to periodically dig out its remote and turn the thing back on. The TV is on - the speaker is on. The TV is off - the speaker can go to standby mode. That's how it's supposed to work, and that's why I give 2 stars out of five.",2,1,2019-4-30,1,4,0

"This soundbar is AMAZING! I already own a few TCL TVs and I love them, so I wanted to add more sound to my living room TV as we often have people over to watch football games, UFC fights etc. I'm pretty OCD about things, and wanted my soundbar to match my TV, so when I found out TCL was coming out with soundbars I was super stoked! Setup was easy and the sound is AWESOME! It really makes me feel like I am at a movie theater or sporting event! It's just what I was looking for I couldn't be happier. The price is great and you wont be disappointed!",5,1,2019-5-10,1,3,0
"My whole problem with this soundbar is in the headline. I have a TCL TV Serie 5 which doesn't have terrible speakers comparing with some others LED TV, but it's obviously not really good neither. Then I decided to improve a bit the sound quality to ge something with a cleaner sound for movies mostly and a bit more bass. This soundbar look good and fit just okay with my TV, either if I expected a better fit with dimension. So everything about this soundbar is decent for the price (including bluetooth  and Hdmi arc). But this is absolutely NOT an improvement  to my TV. The sound is barely better. I had to listen very carefully to realize that there is a little more clarity but just a little and in a movie it is barely noticable.I got the 7 without subwoofer so I don't expected much for the bass but this has pretty much no bass at all ! Even at this price range there is no way this worth the investment over my tv sound.",2,1,2019-8-30,1,1,0
"This sound bar and sub woofer set works great and is really easy to use with a Roku TV.  The sound is a big improvement over the build in Roku TV speaker.  The bass sound is good, the normal sound from the sound bar sound good as well.  My only complain with this is the power save feature.  It will time out before the TV goes out meaning you have to turn it on.  This works well if you use the remote provided with the TV.  However, if you're using one of the RF Roku remotes, it will not turn the speaker back on.  It would be nice to have a way to turn off the time out or increase the time out.  This was by no means something to make me not want the speaker, it's a great sound bar.  Just an unfortunate issue when using a different remote.  I would recommend this if using a Roku TV, unsure how well it works with other TVs.",5,1,2019-7-1,1,2,0
This was super easy to set up with my TCL Roku TV.  The sound is exactly what I wanted.  My only issue is that I am not wall mounting my TV and the sound bar does not nestle nicely underneath so it block the TV sensor.  There is a sensor you plus into the soundbar & stick on he TV to fix this issue - only it hasn't really worked.  So that's been annoying.  I will continue to adjust it's placement to see if I can make it work better.,4,1,2019-12-17,1,3,0
"I'm not looking for some elaborate home theater setup, just an improvement to the standard flatscreen speakers. This is perfect. It adds so much depth to the audio experience that I forgot was there. I recommend this as a cost-effective way of enhancing your TV experience.The setup was an absolute breeze. I have a TCL TV, so with the ARC connection, it's essentially a plug-and-play. On that note, the only thing that is inconvenient for me is that the sound bar is slightly taller than the gap between the bottom of the TV and the shelf - i.e., the TV's legs are too short to allow the sound bar to fit snuggly under the TV, so it blocks the TV remote's sensor. Whatever, I'll use the Roku app as a remote.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,2,0
"Very easy to install with my 55"" TCL. The sounds is a HUGE step up from TV speakers. I read about people having problem with the volume. I did not have this problem. It was also powerful enough to scare my dog a little at first when I was playing Doom. I live in a 1,500 sqft house, and this is fills the entire house with sound when the volume is at 60/100 - even when I'm using power tools.My wife and I both love the Bluetooth connectivity, and the Bluetooth button makes switching inputs very quick and easy. It was very easy to mount this to the wall. I installed a bypass outlet to run cords behind the wall, so you see any cords running to the TV. This fits beautifully right under my TV.",5,1,2019-7-1,1,2,0
"The Alto 7+ is an amazing value at less than $200.  It was so easy to set up and the sound was terrific, especially considering the cost.  The cables were included (typically you are forced to buy in addition to the soundbar) and the wall mounting kit made it quick and easy..even for me!  The fact that I can control with my existing  TCL remote is also very beneficial in my house which already includes far too many remotes!  Oh and my kids love how easy it is to connect to their tablets to listen to their music via the easy to connect Bluetooth functionality.  Overall GREAT Soundbar.",5,1,2019-5-16,1,1,0
"I have a TCL w/Roku TV in my RV that is about a year old.  The built-in speakers sound like tin cans on strings, so I wanted something a little better.  This Alto 7+ 2.1 soundbar & subwoofer fills the bill perfectly.  My RV has a telescoping TV lift built into one of the cabinets so I was able to mount this soundbar directly under the TV on the lift mechanism after adding my own home-made crossbar.  Fits and works perfectly!  The wireless subwoofer is hidden behind the reclining theater seats on the opposite wall.  What more could I possibly ask for?  It gives FAR BETTER sound quality than the stock TV speakers, but let's get real here:  It's still only a 2.1 speaker system so it's not up to true theatrical sound quality.  But still, for $149 bucks it's a HUGE improvement and a great deal.  Oh, and a couple days after I paid $149 they dropped the price to $129.  Go figure.  I'm tempted to return it for a refund and buy it right back for $20 less, but I'm too lazy to dismount it and box it up.As for the remote control that some people seem to complain about, the Roku TV remote powers both the TV and the soundbar On/Off, and it controls the volume as well.  The ONLY thing I need to use the Alto 7+ remote for is to switch the EQ setting between Movie-Music-News.  In truth, I'll leave it on Movie for everything because I think music sounds fine on that setting too, and I don't care about the news.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,6,0
"Don’t believe the negative reviews. This thing sounds great. You’ll see a lot of reviews where people complain that they have to turn it all the way up to hear anything. They clearly didn’t hook it up properly. The instructions are very clear and show you what settings to use depending on the way you hook it up. This soundbar sounds great. It’s very clear and crisp and the bass from the sub is just as clean. The IR remote pass through works flawlessly. If you have a WiFi based remote, you may lose a little functionality. The unit comes with a HDMI cable you can use if your television has a HDMI ARC port. It also comes with a digital optical cable (my method of connecting) and an aux cable which probably isn’t the best method. Like I said, it sounds great, was easy to hookup and it’s as simple as plugging the bar and sub into an outlet and connecting the input of your choosing.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,4,0
"Save your money. This is cheap. And this biggest issue is that STUPID 15 minute shut off. You cannot change that so if you are playing or controlling your TV in another room, and need to pause, you can't turn it back on without going back to the room. In today's day and age where things are controlled by apps and phones, this is stupid. And the sound is cheap with little options. No added bass, or reduction. Limited equalizer options.",1,1,2019-12-7,1,6,0
"Owned for several months now.  I mounted it directly to the wall in my kitchen under my cabinet and I use it to connect Alexa so she can finally have some power!  (Yes, in my kitchen. Why not?)  Don't trust the provided drill hole template, mine was off by about 3/4 of a mile.  The Echo dot sits right on top of the speaker and connects via aux cord.  But Alas, this was a fail.  The speaker powers off automatically after a few minutes of idleness.  So if I want to ask Alexa spontaneous dumb questions or play music, I have to turn the speaker on every time.  It ruins the moment and makes me look dumb (but that's not hard to do).  ""D"" for not doing my homework (my wife sarcastically said: ""Nice job Mark"")  But the price is reasonable for the value of the speaker.  The bluetooth seems to connect well, my kids like to connect their phone and play their weird music, my laptop on the table connects to it to play sound.The grill is not fabric, and looks sharp. The all black color is stealthy, all Darth Vader-ish. The color coded label on top helped me learn the LED colors on the front of the speaker:  for example, blue light for bluetooth connection, or green light for auxiliary audio in, etc).  So you can see what it's set to at a glance.  I am somewhat disappointed with the low end frequency sounds, like bass guitars, and the thump of a bass drum or snare, these are lacking and I wish I would have purchased a system with a wireless dedicated bass. Seems to drive the best sound over bluetooth if I turn the volume on my phone to max, then control volume strictly from speaker.  Also lacks clarity with the high frequency sounds like crash symbols, violins, guitar solos, and the pluck of acoustic guitar strings. No equalizer that I'm aware of so I can adjust it.  There are however, three presets, but I only ever use ""Movie"" -  even for just listening to news because the other two are simply more hollow and fall flat (but maybe that's your thing... weirdo).  The volume range is excellent, plenty of power. I wouldn't use this system for my home theater unless it's connected to a receiver that lets you adjust highs and lows, and yes, get the version with the dedicated bass.",3,1,2020-7-16,1,3,0
"I bought this to replace my old 2.0 Vizio soundbar that was five or six years old. The speakers from my old Vizio sounded slightly better (more highs and clearer), but the bass from the TCL subwoofer is more punchy. This might be because the speakers on the Vizio are slightly bigger. The whole Vizio unit is almost twice as tall as this unit. I ended up keeping the system because if you get the Alto 7+ and connect it to your TCL TV through the HDMI ARC port, you can control the TV and soundbar through the original TCL Roku remote. But be sure that the IR receiver of the TV is visible to the remote because you cannot mute the soundbar unless it is. Otherwise you can control the volume up/down through the soundbar directly.I  gave this 4 out of 5 stars because I wish it was a more more detailed than my old system and had actual EQ settings like treble and bass.",4,1,2019-6-19,1,4,0
I own a TCL 6 series tv and it fits perfectly under that tv. It's has HDMI arc and is easy to use. Sound quality is okay. I am used to home theatre speakers so I think I am biased against sound bars in general.  I think it's better than tv speakers.,4,1,2019-4-20,1,9,0
"The TCL Alto 7+ sounds really good using Bluetooth. The sound shakes my house. On the other hand, there is almost no sound coming out of it until I reach volume level 70 or above like other users have said. Turning it up to volume 100 is still not loud. I went through troubleshooting with TCL support and everything is hooked up correctly. I tried using both THE HDMI ARC and optical cable on my  75"" TCL's, and it made no difference. I also have a 55"" TCL TV and I hooked it up, and it sounded the way I would expect a sound bar to sound.

However, there is a large caveat that is not disclosed in the description.  It will only work with the infrared remote that comes with the Roku TV.  If your TCL Roku TV comes with a voice remote, it will NOT control the soundbar.  I confirmed this with TCL customer support after calling them to see why my remote would not work.

"I bought my TCL Alto 7.2.0 sound bar to pair via HDMI ARC with my TCL 55R617 TV - this seems to be a popular bundle on Amazon. Unfortunately it suffers from a serious flaw.The minor flaws are somewhat 'muddy' sound, with lower-pitched dialog being very hard to hear, a volume control that adjusts painfully slowly between silent and slightly loud, and a flaw which means that if your TV/sound bar combo isn't switched off manually but sleeps due to inactivity, the sound bar won't wake up and has to be unplugged to power it off.",1,1,2019-6-20,1,6,0

"UPDATE - DAY 2 - PART 2:After some digging around, it turns out that buried on TCL's site, there is a firmware update (v0.1.2, which isn't reassuring) for the soundbar.

"I had an expert install the sound bar.  If you want to do it yourself, you will need knowledge on how these things work. I bought a new TV from the same manufacturer. One would think it would install with no problems. However, the installation person could not get the sound come on automatically when my TV was turned on, I opened a case with TLC. They sent me a new remote which was as dead as a door-nail. They then informed me that the remote for my TV is not compatible with the sound bar. They offered to send me a remote that is more basic but I refused as I did not know if this remote would be really helpful in running my TV. The reason for the compatibility issue is that I bought the 2018 model and the sound bar is probably the 2019 model.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,4,0
"I can't believe the same company made my TV made this sound bar. Works when it wants to, kicking in and out. Works with some apps, not others (how?) sometimes stays through a whole DVD. The remote is great if you want a chunk of plastic to hold down paper, but does not actually operate any electronics....except for when you've hit volume down and nothing has happened and suddenly five minutes later it rolls down to nothingness. If I had not accidentally thrown away the box, it would be going back to Amazon. I may still give it to someone I hate.",1,1,2020-3-14,1,4,0
"I got rid of cable almost ten years ago and have been a strictly stream kind of guy. I purchased a 60' TCL Roku Television, I wasn't impressed with the audio, it was OK but a little flat EQ wise and the built in enhancements didn't help much. I purchased this sound bar, after reading some reviews, watching some Youtube unboxings, which were mixed but I decided to go with it. I'm not sure who these people are who review products but for me this thing is very  nice for the price. Here's what I can say, I won't go through all the specs because even though I could, none of that really matters in my opinion, it's the sound quality.1.For me, I have a relatively small one bedroom apartment, decent size.  I have a 4K Firestick, PS4 that's basically it. After installation, it took a little adjusting but once I did that, I immediately could hear the difference. An important thing to note. These days, audio and video is coming from so many different sources, Youtube, Netflix, if you're still doing the cable thing... the important thing to know is this is only going to sound as good as your source output. That means if you're watching some video on Youtube or an old DVD movie, don't expect this to blow you away with sound because it all depends on how the audio source was encoded, bottom line some things will sound better than others, it's not the speakers fault necessarily.  When I plugged in the PS4 and tested it out with a few games, it was immediately clear how much better the audio was. Explosions, SFX and BGM were resounding and filled with rumbling low tones and bright high to midrange  panning from left to right. The EQ only has three presets MOVIE, NEWS and MUSIC, I set it to MOVIE which sounds the best to me, the subwoofer really thumps on this setting.",4,1,2020-5-15,1,3,1
"I got this on Prime Day as a package deal with a matching 55"" TCL television. A major influence for me (besides the price) was the Bluetooth connectivity so I could reduce wires on my wall-mounted TV. After trying for hours to get the BT to work, I contacted TCL customer support which was difficult for me because I'm a male. After a long and difficult-to-understand conversation (don't you dare call me racist, I just had difficulty understanding with the accent and poor connection) with support, I was informed the BT doesn't work with the TV, it's intended only for connecting with mobile devices. Really? Really?In addition to the lack of BT connectivity, and I'm being honest here, the audio from the soundbar isn't any better or louder or deeper or higher than the speakers in the TV itself. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you want a rather large mobile speaker for your smartphone. The TCL TV itself is wonderful though. Don't know how they missed the mark so bad on the sound bar.",1,1,2019-8-1,1,2,0
"I, like many others, have the typical cheap 50-ish inch 4K TCL TV. I purchased this as a cheap means to upgrade the audio. I'll be blunt - this is significantly worse than the built in audio on that TV, and frankly worse than most other TV's built in audio.The bluetooth connectivity is neat, and ARC is nice to have, but it just sounds so bad. It can be loud, sure, but at the end of the day everything sounds muddy and compressed.",1,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"For the price, this is a decent little sound bar.  It offers pretty good sound and even has a surprisingly reasonable level of bass despite not being paired with a subwoofer.  My biggest complaint is that the volume seems to jump from just a tad too quiet to a tad too loud.  The loud parts of movies get too loud, quickly, so I turn it down a bit and then when it gets back to dialogue, I have to adjust it back up.  I can't seem to find a happy medium.  Also, it only seems to want to turn on with the remote for the speaker, the TV remote doesn't turn it on (it's a TCL TV).If I had to do it again, I'd get something that a) had better sound control, b) had HDMI input that would allow the TV to power it on and c) get one with a subwoofer.  Like I said, it does have a surprising amount of bass but more low end would be nicer.",4,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I bought this sound bar because I own a TCL TV and I didn’t want to add another remote. I wasn’t looking for dramatic room-filling surround sound for movies, rather, maybe just some enhanced sound and more clarity, as I suffer from deficient hearing. This sound bar delivers neither. I have a Bose Solo 5 on another TV that does have better sound and a button for speech that actually works. The TCL sound bar reminds me of the sound you used to get when they used to build real speakers into the TV set.

"Added this sound bar to my TCL-TV. The TV's speakers needed help and this did the trick.  I have not used the blue tooth so I am not judging that.  I will say that the sound bar does work with my TV remote but does not engage the on screen display.  I cannot choose my own sound settings, just 3 programmed choices: news, movies, music. Okay for me but probably not for someone who wants  premium sound.  But it works well for the price and set-up was easy.  I do wish the unit wasn't so long. As you see in the picture, I use  a stand and this sound bar is too big to put on the lower shelf. I knew that when I purchased it. However, I live in an apartment, and did not plan on mounting it on the wall.  I thought I could put the TV on top, but it is rounded, but It works fine in front of the TV, just be aware it's not optimal this way.  And the instructions recommend not to obstruct the area around the sound bar.  FYI",4,1,2020-7-4,1,0,1

I originally purchased the Alto 7 2.0 soundbar with internal subwoofer, but I was disappointed by the wimpy sound of the bass from the 2.0.  Sound quality is important to me as I frequently listen to music in my kitchen.  I returned/exchanged for the Alto 7+2.1 that I'm extremely happy with.  The sound is fantastic and fills my kitchen with full-spectrum sound.  The only improvement I wish was available is the ability to adjust the bass/treble, but it's not essential as the sound quality is very good.I was even able to hide the subwoofer behind the TV on the shelf.  Setup was incredibly simple.  Subwoofer pairs automatically to the soundbar and the volume is controlled automatically by the TV through the HDMI/ARC - I don't even need to use the soundbar remote control at all.

"I got this to replace my vizio sound bar that mounted below the tv with these small drop down arms then screw bolt into hole. This speaker does not use the standard threaded bolt hole instead it uses a plastic key hole shaped hanger like you find on a pre-made shelf. These can break and warp over time since they are plastic, but a strong ABS at least. Does not go into standby when the TCL TV goes into standby but rather a few hours later. The speaker can be awaken by pushing the volume up key on the TV roku remote.

I bought this soundbar specifically to pair with my TCL Roku TV because I was having a hard time getting another soundbar that I purchased to connect to it. This ""soundbar"" is not a soundbar. The sound volume is worse than the TV itself. The sound goes from 1-100. Normal sound in a small livingroom starts around 60. If I'm washing dishes or something that adds to background noise, I have to turn it up to 90. But even 90 isn't crazy loud. 100 isn't crazy loud. I bought a soundbar to give more gravity to the programs and movies I'm watching, but I feel that this device takes away from that.

"I'm really happy with the Alto 7 because it has an HDMI connection- once I set up the soundbar (an extremely easy process), I was able to adjust the volume with my Roku TV remote. The sound is also great.One thing to note is that, at least with the TV I have (43"" TCL 4K Roku TV), if you don't/can't mount either your TV or the soundbar, the soundbar (when sitting in front of the TV) is tall enough that it covers the signal receiver on the TV and you would only be to change the channels by holding the remote up at an angle.

"I bought this soundbar when it first came out for TCL Roku TV compatibility, so I wouldn't have to worry about using a second remote. There was a vague implication (product description was less accurate at the time) that it was compatible with the roku remote, which it is not. TCL's biggest selling point over other budget TVs is integrated Roku, so one would expect full integration with the remote. Since the soundbar blocks the TV's IR receiver when placed on the same horizontal surface, I have gone back to using the TV's built-in speakers. The 7-model soundbar is too long for the surface I have my 49"" TCL 5-series TV on, so I'm without any viable pass-through options.

"I purchased this because my TCL tv speakers for some reason weren't as loud as they use to be. Turns out I just needed to move my tv and they got louder. Which I figured out after I ordered this 😆 Any who, item arrived on time with pretty fast shipping, about 4 days. It was bigger than I excepted for the price tag of around $135 after tax. Hook up was super simple and came with all cords to hook up all the different ways. I use the optic cord and it sounds great. Easy settings in my tv to get it connected to the speaker. Now the Bluetooth. This thing is incredible!! I was completely impressed. That subwoofer hits pretty damn hard and the speaker gets almost too loud 🤣 and I LOVE loud music. I find the Bluetooth is significantly louder than the optic setting for sound. But I don't want my movies as loud as my music anyways. Just as good, if not better than the $300 systems some of my friends have. My TCL tv remote controls the unit as well. Only thing I don't like is there are only 3 preset settings to choose from for sound. Other than that, I highly recommend checking this out. You won't be disappointed.

It works; occasionally loses the connection, an easy re-do, but this does not provide the stereo sound or the range of sound you might be looking for.  The Subwoofer provides a very quiet bass; if it's lost connection, you might not notice.  It certainly does not provide the ""feel"" you'd expect in an action scene.

No real bass on this sound bar so if you need the bass, get the subwoofer.  Only thing I don’t like is my Roku Streaming Stick+ remote will no longer control volume and I have to use the tiny sound bar remote to adjust volume, then go back to Roku remote for all other functions.  Not sure I gained much as multiple remotes is not what I was looking for.  Low marks for remote capabilities.  I’ll use the sound bar until I get a new TV at some point.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Sounds okay, perhaps not incredibly better than the regular tv without the sound bar, but no complaints there. And I could live with the fact that it only starts with the tv 50% of the time. But it has a VERY short sleep function and no way to disable it. So if you want to pause for a few minutes to grab a snack or get the mail, be prepared to dig out your sound bar remote to restart the thing. Wish I’d known before purchase.",3,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"It’s no secret that TCL’s tv sound is lousy. To boot, my 2 year old Roku 45” tv’s audio started having a (commonly reported) garbled, underwater sound.  Turning off the volume leveling corrected that. (The video also intermittently disappears, but that’s a whole other (known) issue.Enter the TCL sound bar. When you connect the sound bar, you turn off the tv speakers which removes the tv sound mode and leveling options. So now I can hear the tv program at an almost preferred level - the volume increments could use improvement - but the commercials are way too loud. (Maybe 1-2 volume clicks higher - Isn’t there a law against this, FCC?) Netflix and Hulu were also erratic, but not nearly as bad as cable.",2,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
I would recommend this soundbar if you are looking for good quality for a low price. Replacing a Klipsch R10b that got fried by lightning.

"Not the greatest but definitely packs a pretty good punch for the money. It sounded better than the Bose 5 sound bar we had. Fuller range of frequencies as well. Only issue is that the unit doesn’t control from our directv remote except for volume. It turns on when we push the volume up on the directv remote when we only want the tv volume to turn up.Issue: the audio is delayed from the video. I know this because when the tv volume is on alongside this sound bar, it is well behind the tv sound. Like a bad echo of about 1/2 second. It’s almost unusable. Sound effects are behind and conversations almost feel like an old Karate film with voice overs.",2,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0

They advertise it is 2.6 inches deep. What they don’t tell you are the brackets and power cord add another inch and a half in depth.

We bought a 65 inch TCL 6 series TV and also bought this TCL sound bar. It greatly enhances your viewing experience with solid sound and a sub woofer that does the low end job as well. The sound fills our den just fine. The price is a big selling point as well. Don't hesitate to buy this. I am an audiophile for decades and I find no fault in this system. I come from the surround sound home theater heyday and a sound bar with wireless sub woofer work perfectly. Two thumbs up. 👍👍,5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,1
The lows were so bad that I thought the subwoofer wasn’t connected. I tried the different modes but none of them were good. They all sounded barely better than the bad tv speakers and worse than my first gen Amazon Echo. I couldn’t find any way to adjust the sound other than the presets. I ended up replacing it with a Vizio SB3621n that sounds much better.The one thing the TCL does better than the Vizio is the TCL has an hdmi in that lets it connect smartly to the tv. It turns on and off automatically and the tv volume buttons control the sound bar. For the vizio I have to leave it on all the time and use a universal remotes that sends the volume buttons to the sound bar.,2,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
Ordered the TCL Alto5 for living room tv and it sounds great. Just enough base and it enhances your tv volume to sound crisper and with great base a great clarity. Set up was not hard but had to provide one of the cords myself (audio in/out cord) because the one provided did not work on my tv. Functions are great and straight forward on the soundbar and the remote. Only drawback is the remote is tiny (2 inches long 1.5 inches wide). I can see this tiny remote being lost very quickly. Over all a great product for $49. Strongly recommend buying.,5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"Bought a TCL 6 Series 55"" and thought the 7.1 TCL soundbar would be a great way to go.  So far, the sound is decent BUT I cannot get the picture abd sound to sync. The sound is a fraction behind the picture.  Tried changing to optical cable connection but no help.  TCL Support has been no help.  Since they are somewhere in Asia, if your issue does not fall into one of their scripted answers they do not know what to do. Their are no A/V Sync settings on either the TV or the sound bar.

I bought because I have a tcl tv that has horrible sound. It does work well with the factory remote and the sounds is much better. The shocking thing is the volume. It seems much less than the factory speakers. I rarely used more than 50% before and now they do sound better and I can understand the dialogue but the volume is 50-100%It's just kind of shocking that an upgraded sound system with so many boxes doesn't correlate to an increased volume capability. In fact it's worse.,4,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"This this was terrible!!! Even right out of the box the sound bar was barely louder than my actual tv. When it worked, the sub woofer was awesome! In order to ensure the subwoofer was working tho I had to smack the top of it. Then about 4 weeks after dealing with the sub par quality the sound bar stopped working. It will turn on and then cycle thru different lites and then shut off. I want to return this thing but can’t even figure out how to send it back in. I wish I would have spent the extra $30 for a better one.",1,1,2019-11-5,1,1,0

"I bought this to pair with a JVC 43"" smart 4K TV who's speakers left much to be desired, As I have this in a bedroom I didn't really need the sub woofer so the 7.0 version was perfect. Wall mounting was simple and the HDMI ARC made for an instant connection to the TV. I would like to see more user adjustment than the 3 presets but that is quibbling for a sub $80 speaker. Sound is clear and room filling and while not surround sound the design does give much more presence than the built in ones. Having the option to pair with  a Bluetooth headset for night viewing while not disturbing others is a nice bonus",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"Has HDMI Arc, so you don't have to turn it on and off, just works with your normal operation.  Thin TV's today don't have room for adequate speakers, so going from TV audio to any soundbar is going to be a huge improvement.

"Bought this sound bar as an add-on to the TCL 75"" Roku TV I just bought... thinking that it would be a no brainer to hook up and should work fine with the TV without having to use a separate remote for the volume.  Well, it hooks up via the optical cable just fine, but it turns out that if you don't use the HDMI ARC port, you won't be able to mute the volume via the TV remote, you will need to use the sound bar remote.  (Maybe you don't, but I use the mute button a lot.)  I read about this beforehand on these Amazon reviews, so I was expecting this.  What I wasn't expecting is that this soundbar doesn't come with an HDMI ARC port.  Seriously?  Considering that answer about needing to use the HDMI ARC port came from TCL, they might have mentioned that it wasn't an option at all.Anyways, in the short time I used this, the sound was pretty good for what you would expect from this type of setup.  The wireless bass seemed to work good and sound decent too.

"Worst $130 I’ve ever spent my money on. You know, initially, this product worked really well. I wasn’t too familiar with soundbars and subwoofers prior to purchasing it. I went as far as finding audio tests on YouTube to see what I was working with. It was awesome, it sounded like I was at a movie theater! However, later that night, my girlfriend and I watched a movie on Netflix. I noticed every time there is dialogue only, the soundbar is accompanied by a very noticeable high-pitched noise. It’s as if the soundbar is good for one time use only. Not to mention, the subwoofer would get “confused.” What I mean by that is it couldn’t distinguish the appropriate time to activate. For example, there would be a scene with dialogue only. No music, none of that. However, the subwoofer thought it was supposed to be in use and would give off a “farting” noise (that’s the best way to describe it). I was very upset in this purchase. I’m looking to send this crap back, because it’s honestly a joke. You’re better off investing in something that is $70 more and I guarantee you won’t run into these problems. The best part about this product was the remote 😂. Pathetic!",1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"This is a great sound bar for the price, sound wise. We use it in a smallish room and it fills it well. Particularly because the TCL TV's internal speakers are not the greatest. My biggest gripe is that this doesn't work with the Roku Voice (RF) remote. Worked fine with the IR Roku remote that came with the TV, but I upgraded that remote to an RF one because it was truly terrible (you had to figure out the exact spot to point it at on the TV, and it took multiple button pushes to get any reaction from the TV). Anyway, the RF remote works great with the TV, but come to find out does control the volume on this sound bar. So now I have to use the sound bar's remote to control the sound bar volume. This is not clearly disclosed anywhere, as others have said. It's a real bummer for an otherwise good product.",3,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"Does exactly what it says. I bought a TCL 50 inch Roku TV in April 2020 and my sound bar wasnt compatible with the TV remote. I bought this to use with the Roku TV's HDMI ARC capabilities so I could control the sound bar with the Roku remote. It was super easy to set up. It recognized the sound bar automatically. All I had to do was go into the menu and turn off the TV speakers. Volume up, down, and mute all work flawlessly. Pretty loud, loud enough for most rooms I would think. Sounds good. If you're looking for top of the line sound you shouldn't be looking at less than 100 dollar sound bars anyway. If you have a TCL Roku TV this is a no brainer. I would think this sound bar would be sufficient for 90 percent of the people who are thinking about buying it seriously enough to have read this entire review.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"Coming from base tv stero sound, these things are night and day different. Sound is Soo much crisper and deep, I believe has to do with the fact they are forward facing nd the subwoofer is where ever you put it. I am still experimenting on where the best place to put the subwoofer would be. Base is deafening and for an average open livingroom I can't see why you'd more than this. I ran almost to full power and I could hear the music from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor. They get loud...maybe not rave party loud but base is def there. For the price there is almost no risk. You can't go wrong w this unit.",5,1,2020-9-7,1,1,0
"Not bad for it's price. Has it's drawbacks (no sub level adjustment, minimal EQ adjustment). BUT, for a HDMI ARC hook up with a wireless subwoofer at this price point I am happy. The sub is a bit lacking and (as mentioned) has no adjustment. Soundbar is decent, loud but lacking range. Connectivity was simple and BT is a nice addition. Nice size at 36"".Another plus or minus, depending on your situation...The soundbar wall mounts with plastic keyhole connections at the back. Nice for a wall mount but if you want to VESA mount w/ a bracket you'll need to find your own hardware that fits that narrow keyhole.",3,1,2020-8-6,1,0,1

"It arrived well protected in only two days.  Setup took less than ten minutes (mostly changing the TV settings).  I strongly suggest only using the TV HDMI(ARC) connection for good audio quality and easy use.  That way the TV's volume control and mute functions affect the soundbar and you can leave the soundbar's remote in the drawer.  Although the TV optical output produces great sound, for some crazy reason the TV optical output is not affected by the volume control and mute.  Therefore you have to use the soundbar's remote for those functions. Stick with HDMI(ARC).  Overall, I'd give this product a solid ""A""",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0

I have a Samsung TV that's connected to an Apple TV. My room is pretty small and it really gives the impression of being an actual surround sound system. The only complaint I have is that there is no volume indicator. Sometimes after my brother uses it for his music, the volume is still set to very loud and you don't know until you connect your TV again.

"TL;DR sound is great and easy to use, ARC control is broken, need to use included remote to wake from sleepPaired with a TCL TV. Sound quality is great compared to built in TCL speakers, adds the lacking detail and is much warmer than the standard speakers.  Unit was easy to setup and controls are simple  when it works (my setup is auto-on and volume control over ARC.) The real bummer is that the device sometimes will not wake/power-on on a consistent basis.  This is my second unit, both exhibited the same behavior.  I have learned to live with it (manually power it on with it's own remote, and not the TCL Roku or on-unit power button) but I bought this to be as easy to use as possible, and that it is not. My only other note, when using ARC, a device will show on the Roku menu, that cannot be removed, which may bug you if you like specific organization on the menu.",3,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0

"This provides really good sound for the price.  It's 4 bar speakers do very well, but the sperate base speaker is just 'ok'.  And there is no volume control for it.  Only option is to move it directly in front of you to get 'more base' out of it; it's wireless to the TV, so that is an option, but there is still a power cord to content with.The biggest downfall for me is that the bar will not pair with my Vizio TV.  The two are not compatible.  So, I have to control the volume through the TCL remote, only.  I talked with both Vizio and TCL soundbar, and that's the fact.  VIZIO ""might"" add TCL to their auto-list of pairing in the future , but it cannot pair even through manual mode of pairing.  Not a huge deal to have to use two remotes, but not super convenient, either.",3,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I bought this to upgrade the sound on a tv I bought for my office, hoping to replace a couple of small old desktop speakers with it.  While better than the tv audio, its not by much.  The sound is tinny and mids are almost non existent.  The sub, while easy to connect, has absolutely no controls.  In order to hear the sub or make this thing sound remotely good, i have to use a system EQ to bring the bass and mid way up.I'm probably going to end up putting the Alto in my guest room where it will get used 4-5 times a year and buy a decent system for my office.",2,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

"Two things. There is no tone control with this device so you can't sharpen it. On the other hand, it has a lot of good base notes for smaller speakers.

"This soundbar is solid for being connected to my TV and playing the volume at a great level.The issue I have is the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone seems to be spotty at best. Connecting the iPhone via Bluetooth from just a few feet away and playing music, the music stutters/lags the entire time. I've tried using music that was downloaded to my phone (so that I didn't need to stream), I've tried other iPhones (newer and older), and I've tried being right next to the speaker vs very far away. The issue is always that the audio comes over VERY choppily and it's unusable. It's a bummer because I like the speaker and didn't try the BlueTooth aspect until my 90 day warranty was over. Has anyone else had this issue??",2,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

Easy to connect. Do not recognize any dialect timing off as mentioned in any other comments. Easy to mount and set up. Only complaint is the the sensor for the sound bar seems to throw off the sensor on my TCL tv. So sometimes i will by pressing buttons to get it to work.

Small and nit picky complaint but no major issues with this one,5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"I like almost everything about this sound bar.  Great sound for the size and price.  I paired it with a TCL Roku TV.  Set up was simple and it works great right out of the box.  The only problem I have is that you can pretty much run everything with the just the TV remote - except the mute button!  The volume works, but not the mute.  So you have to keep the dinky little soundbar remote around to mute the sound.  Yeah, there are sound presets on the soundbar remote, (news, movies, etc..) but most of us set that once and just leave it.  It's tiny and it doesn't have real buttons, just little raised bumps with barely legible markings - so you almost have to turn on the lights to see them...",4,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

I need to press the buttons for a few seconds before it knows that I have pressed it.",4,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
My wife & I have problems hearing television and had been using headsets. Now with this sound bar we haven't needed them as the sound is much clearer. It would be nice if there was an easy to read indicator to what source the sound bar was receiving the sound though (that's why just 3 stars for remote Control).

We purchased a TCL Roku TV about a year ago. We recently purchased a TCL sound bar and are attempting to connect the sound bar which needs HDMI arc and our DIRECTV cable box which also needs HDMI Arc. We thought it would be simple To hook up a TCL sound bar to a TCL TV. However our experience has not gone well. I’ve looked through all the questions and answers and none of them seem to address this particular issue. It has been very eye-opening As this should have been an easy setup.,1,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
I had no issues connecting it to my TCL TV via optical cable. TV remote still controls volume. Only negatives are 1) Loss of OSD for volume. Not sure if that is really something I can fault the sound bar for. 2) Lack of even basic audio controls like bass/trebel. It can be quite boomy and makes it difficult to watch TV at night without disturbing the house.,4,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0

For the price of just $129 you're getting a pretty amazing deal with both the soundbar and the sub. While if you're goimg for a full home theater K would say go for something a lot more expensive. I have this just in my room because the speakers on my Tv isn't great. For small to medium rooms this thing is great as while the bass won't shake the whole room you can still feel its presence.

And on some ""soft"" shows, it's not uncommon for us to have the volume turned up close to all the way.  So, no idea how long this will last since it has to be turned up so loud all the time.",1,1,2019-11-27,1,2,0
We hooked this sound bar up and are very happy with it. It comes on automatically when the tv comes on.

The bad - there is little to no bass unless you crank the volume and even then it is only slightly present.I even went through the trouble of putting this in a corner to amplify the little bass it did have. Ultimately this is im a bed room so lack of bass when watching movies at night isn't a complete deal breaker, but there are much better performing sound bars at this price point.

I wasn't expecting much from a lower priced sound bar, but I think these could be improved upon even at this price point.

Got this soundbar for my dad who has trouble hearing. We are both very happy and satisfied with this. All the cables you need are in the box. The built in subwoofer is a huge plus. The sound is loud and crisp. It easily connects to Bluetooth and the TV. I will admit it did take a little bit connecting the TV remote to the soundbar but it did pair up and it makes it easier to use just one remote for both tv and soundbar.

Sounds nice the one I got has the sub woofer. And it’s plenty enough loud to shake my house. For the people that gave it s bad review. Somehow your not doing something right. Use the optical connections if you have it. My Tcl tv remote controls the volume Super easy to get working,5,1,2019-7-6,1,2,0
This sound bar was a huge disappointment. It sounded tinny and my internal TV speakers sounded better. Then there’s the annoying function that requires you to scroll through all the different settings/colored lights every time you turn it on. That was a real nuisance. Had to return this after the audio output started to become intermittent.,2,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"This soundbar has very good quality sound.  Nice highs and channel separation.  The Bluetooth subwoofer handles the low end adequately as well.  I installed on the top of a TCL 55"" Class 6-Series 4K 55R625 using the recommended Mounting Dream bracket.  I had much better luck with an HDMI (ARC) connection rather than an optical cable.  Both cables are included, but the optical cable is rather cheap and I had an issue with picture and sound in sync.  No such problem with HDMI.  Plus, if you go with HDMI (ARC) you can use the Roku remote to control sound on the TCL 4K TV.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,1
"I recently purchased a TCL 65 QLED and along with it this TCL soundbar.  The hook up was super smooth and it all technically works. However, the subwoofer, despite a variety of placements and settings is almost non-existent, unless of course you turn up the overall system volume to some ridiculous level. I pretended it was OK for a week or two but finally decided to return it. I replaced with a Yamaha YAS 209BL, which is admittedly twice the price - but it was WELL worth it. Better sound, independent subwoofer controls and tons of headroom in the bass department. Bottom line, if you're going to get a new big screen TV don't skimp on the sound.",3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"Setup was easy, and took about five minutes using the optical cable connection to my television. I’m not really an audiophile, but the sound is great for what I needed. I’m using it in a reasonably small bedroom, but it feels like it would be loud enough for a larger room or living room area. I really liked that the sub unit is wireless. If I had any complaint, it might be that you have to press the volume up and down more than I would have expected to change the volume, but it's barely even worth mentioning.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"This product surpassed my expectations, it was easy to setup and connect to my TV. With a few easy steps I easily got everything up and running within 10 minutes from unboxing the product. My TV sits in a built-in cabinet with the speakers on the back so the sound just bounces around. With the TCL sound bar and subwoofer connected, I know have amazing sound that makes me feel like I am in the action which makes for a much better viewing experience.

"Tcl 5 series speakers sound better. Sound bar sounds muffled or bass orientated, dialogue is very bad.

Might sound better on a higher end tv. Worth $50 tops",2,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
Do not buy. Volume projects very low and can not be altered. Delay between picture and sound which is frustrating when watching tv.

Our TV didn't seem to have the volume coming out the front but back towards the wall. We had to turn the volume way up to hear what the actors were saying. This TCL sound bar is great it puts the sound forward and we can turn the volume way down. Great Price too,4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

"I purchased because I had bought the 65inch TCL qled TV. I worried as many reviews stated it had connection issues and that's the main reason I kept like brand. Hooked up with HDMI, ARC on TV, and it took me messing around about 20 min to get connected. I honestly don't think I did anything magical, I think it finally connected. It worked great with no connection issues until I changed out for a longer HDMI cable. Had same issue, but again, it connected and has worked now for the past month with no issues. Not super loud, but clear and works for my intention.",4,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
I ordered this speaker because the speakers that are in the TCL tv sucks. It was easy to set up and trust me when I say easy I mean easy. I now can keep my volume on my tv at a 23 instead of 35-40 to hear it. I am very satisfied with this purchase. No issues at this time.,5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0

"Set up was super easy and functioned pretty well with our Roku TV. You'd expect that, being made by the same company. What I should have also expected was sub-par sound from a company that specializes in making okay TVs. The sound just wasn't great.

"The Samsung Smart TV speakers started cracking so I chose to go with a sound bar from Amazon rather than buy a new TV, however if it wasn't for U Tube I would never have figured out how to set it up because the directions left out how to bypass the TV speakers and get the output to the sound bar. This is not a plug and play operation.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
This product is great for the money the sound quality is much better than the television.  The bass is awesome it literally shakes my dishes in the kitchen cabinet when music is playing.

I guess I should have known I wouldn’t be blown away with a $120 sound bar. It’s underwhelming. When purchasing a sound bar I expect to have the sound be crystal clear and need a minimum amount of volume to get a real movie theatre feel.

Each one is hooked up to a TCL tv and you have to have the volume up almost to its limit to hear anything.  When you try to switch from one streaming channel to another (i.e. Hulu to Netflix), the sound bar loses connection and you have to turn the tv completely off for several minutes and then turn it on to the streaming channel you want.  And that doesn’t always work.  You’d think since the tv and sound bar are made by the same company, they’d work better together.  Definitely not worth the headache.",1,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

I probably spent more money than I wanted to but it was worth it.

"I must say, I’m impressed. I didn’t have high expectations for this one at all and the sound quality is really good.  It’s not as good as Bose but for most people this is perfect!  If you’re coming from high end speakers, you may not necessarily love this product. I really like it when watching movies, listening to music and playing games. Sound is very crisp and clear.

Was not impressed at all. I have a TCL Tv that’s very nice but sound quality is terrible. I don’t think this soundbar was even louder than the TV volume.

It could be possible that the room I installed the sound bar in is too big but it works well for the price it has. Can't complain about that.

"Beware, the sound quality is way better than the tv (I have TCL 6 series tv) speakers and you can control everything right through your tv remote. It's exactly what I was hoping it would be except the lip sync gradually gets out of sync. There doesn't appear to be any settings on the bar or tv to fix this. After unplugging the tv and messing with the settings everything seems to sync, then after a few YouTube or Hulu videos the syncing gets delayed and you see the lips move before you hear the voices. It's only by a little bit but it's driving me crazy. I've tried HDMI Arc and optical with the same results.**Update 5/6/2019",5,0,2019-4-24,1,7,0
"Works great with TCL 43 inch 4k bedroom TV.  At 36 inches wide, its about exactly the width of the TV itself.  Wall mounting was easy as were the connections, 1 hdmi cable to HDMI1(ARC) on the tv and power.  For the price, I'm quite pleased with the sound and experience.  The sound quality is a good step up from the built in speakers and most importantly it doesn't require a separate remote or any additional steps to use it.  Just turn on the TV and the soundbar turns itself on, adjust the volume or mute with the TV remote and that's what happens.  Turn off the TV and the soundbar automatically goes to sleep.  No extra steps, just works.  I didn't bother with bluetooth, the included remote, spdif, or other sound sources as I didn't need or want those functions.Very minor quirks:  the volume scale is very different than the TV.  A volume of 60-65 with the soundbar is equivalent to 30-35 from the TV before.  Still gets far louder at 100% than i would ever need for a bedroom TV.  Next, the roku TV, on the home screen, always shows a selectable channel for the HDMI1(ARC) input.  If I try to remove this from the home screen it disables the input and then ARC doesn't function, which is how the soundbar gets the audio signal from the TV.  I put it at the end of the list and ignore it, it doesn't hurt anything for it to be there other than to be a visual distraction.",5,0,2019-8-21,1,4,1
"We bought the cheaper TCL Alto 5 2.0 Channel Home Theater Sound Bar - Ts5000, 32"" - between the set top box from CableVision, the TCL 50"" TV and the Soundbar, we had a bit of remote juggling to do to get everything working right.  Finally got it working by having the HDMI set to auto (we had it set to HDMI 2.0 which caused no sound to come out) and selecting it instead of antennae tv in the inputs. We turned off the TV speakers and selected PCM-Stereo as we are connected via optical. This bar has no HDMI ARC feature. For that you need to get the Alto 7+.  We were going to return it before we even opened it as we felt the TCL TV sound was fine but then after watching a few movies, we realized what everyone else was talking about. This soundbar made audio much improved.",4,0,2019-10-25,1,2,0
"If you just want to add a little more sound to your TV without breaking the bank, this works fine.  Yeah it won't rock the doors off the hinges, but for a 5"" subwoofer it manages surprisingly well.I have a TCL 55R613 55"" TV set, and I reversed the feet so the TV can sit on my dresser, and this soundbar fits perfectly right under the set.

"I bought the Alto 7+ for a 50"" Samsung 4K TV for my wife's bedroom for her to watch while she recovers from her illness.  I don't need all the features others need because its for a bedroom tv and not the family room tv set.  Connected to tv via optical cable and the subwoofer paired easily via bluetooth.Other reviewers have said that the sound is weak.  From what I see, it does get loud, but you can barely hear any bass unless the sound is turned way up.  Remote is decent.  Midrange frequencies are just ok.  This soundbar makes my Samsung soundbar look great in comparison.  But it;s still better than the tv speakers.",4,0,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"We have a TCL 55"" Roku TV and bought this bar (Alto 7+) with the HDMI ARC in order to loose the additional speaker remote that we had been using. We hooked up the Speaker. The process was plug and play out of the box. Everything linked up seamlessly. When we turned the TV on and started a show, it took until we hit a volume level of 50 to really hear the show, and average about 70 for normal TV volume. When watching a movie, 100 (the MAX) isn't even very loud.I called TCL Customer Support and they went through troubleshooting with me. We checked and changed the TV settings, Reset the TV settings, and nothing. Support told me that this is ""normal"" for a sound bar. I know this is incorrect as the $50 no name sound bar we had before this one, was very loud, and we NEVER put it on the Max setting. They kept suggesting that I just return the bar as I got it recently.",1,0,2020-4-17,1,0,0

There’s better budget soundbars. I have a TCL Roku tv and thought surely this should work well with its own product. WRONG! Using the HDMI-Arc connection every time I switched between various streaming apps the sound bar would lose the input and I had to get up or use the remote to select the HDMI input. It also happened when the TV went into standby. I tried the optical input and it wasn’t much better and the volume level doesn’t display using optical.Sound-honestly not much better then the TV speakers just front facing. The volume still had to be turned up pretty loud and dialogue wasn’t exceptionally clear. If it was up loud the sound was decent. If not for the connectivity issues this might’ve been worth keeping as just a soundbar for an extra Tv but it’s too annoying. And it’s going back.,2,0,2020-9-6,1,0,0

"Inconsistent sound, muddy all around, completely not worth even the discounted price I got it for.

"TCL makes great TV's, in some cases really excellent TV's. The same cannot be said about the TCL Alto 7+ 2.1 Soundbar with subwoofer. The audio sounds muddy and in some cases crackles. The audio adjustments (bass, treble, loudness) are non existent and instead are limited to pre-configured audio settings for music, movie, and news. I ran the device through various genres of music and found the lacking subwoofer control to be frustrating. Im all for thumping bass, but the mix needs to be just right so it compliments the audio, not drown it out. Lastly, the volume buttons are squishy and the volume change appears to have delay to it, which means it can be slightly tricky to get the volume to the level you desire.On the positive side the subwoofer automatically paired to the soundbar, the ARC input worked great, Bluetooth, USB, AUX, and optical all worked well too. The lacking LCD screen means you are stuck with a decal on top of the soundbar that shows a color code that coordinates to the input you have selected. Its less than an elegant solution, and TCL should consider a small low resolution screen on the device, or include connectivity to a mobile app for more granular control.",2,0,2019-12-12,1,0,0

At that price I absolutely had to have it. I believe there were only 2 left as well. So I took a chance on it (not really because it could always be returned if it was horrible) and set it up a little after getting home. Super easy to set up, extremely basic, with outstanding sound. I mean I even connected the Bluetooth to my phone, put some music on, went all the way to my bathroom took a shower with the bathroom door closed and still heard the music and felt the amazing bass of the subwoofer. If you can get this sound bar on sale I absolutely advise it. If you own a roku tv you can also use your roku tv remote to control the volume of the sound bar.

As many have mentioned, you have to reach sound level 70 for any meaningful output.  My wife sat next to me and it simply didn't ""hit"" our ears.

"La qualité du son n’est pas géniale, surtout lorsqu’on l’utilise en mode Bluetooth pour écouter  de la musique.Les basses sont inaudibles et le son est plutôt pauvre.",2,1,2020-1-6,0,0,0
Easy set up. Just plug the speaker into the TCL tv via an HDMI cable. Great sound.,5,1,2019-8-26,0,3,0
The Sub does not have volume control and does not delivery the deep bass I was hoping for.The sound gets tinny when the volume is higher than half way.,2,1,2020-1-2,0,1,0

"Se escucha bien para su precio, no me agradó que no se sincronice la imagen con la voz conectado en hdmi Arc, se retrasa el audio y hay que ingeniárselas para volver a sincronizarla. La compré porque tengo un televisor de la misma marca y creí que trabajarían en armonía pero resultó que no.",3,1,2020-2-14,0,5,0
I connected the soundbar by HDMI and constantly had issues with it randomly disconnecting and refusing to recognize the input unless I unplugged and plugged it back in multiple times. At about the 2 month mark it just quit working entirely refusing to turn on. Would definitely not recommend.,1,1,2019-11-6,0,5,0
Saved money on the refurb offering.  It appeared brand new as best I could tell.  Simple set up and great sound. I like the fact that you can control the volume with TV remote.,5,1,2019-11-15,0,5,0
This sound bar has numerous way to connect to TV but only one way works---called for help and thy said to hook it up one way and live with it...NO HELP from them.  Also if TV is paused for more than 4 minutes the sound bar automatically shuts off and needs to be restarted.  Not worth it!!!,1,1,2020-1-16,0,2,0

"Wasn’t expecting great sound quality but was pleasantly surprised! Purchased originally just to use with a portable projector but makes my Samsung tv sound much better too. Very easy to set up, compact design and it comes with a little remote. Would definitely recommend !",5,1,2019-8-6,0,2,0
"Update!(Amazon refunded me 50% of the purchase price, although the sound bar isn't bad, it's definitely not worth almost 300 Canadian dollars. if you're Canadian and you're looking at this speaker, I suggest looking at other options, unless you don't mind paying more than what it's worth)",3,1,2020-9-7,0,0,0
"I bought this and paired it with a TCL 40S325-CA 1080p Roku Television. The sound Bar is connected through the HDMI ARC port on the TV, which works well. I am able to control the volume with my TV and Sat receiver remotes.The problem I find is that the volume is low. Depending on the background noise in the room, I am often turning the volume up to 80 - sometimes higher. I have cranked it all the way up to 100, and it is just not that loud. With the SB disconnected, and just the TV speakers, I set the TV volume to around 40 to get the same level of volume. From what I have read, this low volume is a common complaint with this product.",3,1,2020-4-1,0,1,0
"There's 50 dollars of cables in here! It sounds great you should definitely get this for a small laptop or a cheap desktop or secondary tv you want better sound from. Not recommended for home movie theater or gaming pc however, get a real 5.1 or 7.1 set then.",5,1,2019-12-25,0,1,0
I just got the cheapest soundbar I found and got surprised with the quality difference between this sound bar and my TV sound. Definitely worth the upgrade!,5,1,2019-9-21,0,3,0
This sound bar is seriously impressive. I didn’t realize I had bought it. It came in a combo with my tv but man am I glad it did. It’s freaking spectacular.,5,1,2020-6-22,0,0,0
I liked everything about it. Very sleek and well made.  I thought it was a great value at a very reasonable price.Plus I had just bought the 55” TCL Series 6 and it’s a perfect match.,5,1,2020-7-31,0,0,0
I recently purchased the TCL  65 “ QLED Smart TV. My 10 yr surround sound system was not playing well with the Mart TV. Thus I purchased the TCL 2.1 sound bar/subwoofer and glad I did. Good bass. The 3 modes movie/ news/music are indistinguishable IMO but I have not had it long enough to really listen to it for the difference.,5,1,2020-9-25,0,0,0

I did a lot of research before purchasing. We are very happy with sound quality and slim design of this system. I love the fact that if you misplace the remote it’s still fully functional from well designed manual controls directly on top of the unit.,5,1,2020-8-6,0,0,0
