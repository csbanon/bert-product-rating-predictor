"Have read a lot of the negative reviews but can't relate. This gen 3 is meeting expectations. Easy to set up and install.  Just scan the QR code in their app.  I like that I can activate a siren on demand. It has good night vision. Two way convo. And I'm able to adjust the motion sensitivity. I have also been extensively testing it (I receive almost instant notification of motion frequently) and the battery still has a full charge. Does it have a lot of additional bells and whistles like integrating with ring alarm...no. But I knew that already when I READ THE SPECS. Do you need to pay the $30 or $100 per year to record and save...yes. if you are okay with that, the price and features will satisfy and you will likely get a couple of more.  For those having issues, maybe you should request a replacement.  Quality Control is never 100% unfortunately. But If you are still having issues after that.....maybe its......",5,1,2019-10-29,1,7,0
"Just be warned,  I ordered the Ring stickup Solar ""package"" with free echo dot.  I mean really....who would NOT get the echo dot for free???  Why is with or without a free item even a question or an option?!?!?!?  I thought..damn...this price is too good to be true.  And I was RIGHT!  What did I get.... I got a Ring Stick Up Cam,  not battery, not solar and not an indoor.  I don't know WHAT model it was...but get this....their was NO PLACE to plug in the Solar panel.  None.  I hunted down the installation instructions...which requires you to KNOW what you have....so I read them all....my only conclusion is that somehow I got a ""Battery Powered INDOOR ONLY Cam"" with a solar panel.  WTF!  And the Echo DOT????  Nowhere to be seen.  I suspected issues when it ""shipped"" in possibly ""two packages"" and the DOT was NOT listed on the Order receipt.  I am sadly disappointed with Amazon for screwing the pooch on this one.  I am sending them back.  Since I didn't get the Echo DOT I decided to order from ""Ring"" directly for the same price (minus the DOT).  So beware of the Solar ""Bundle"" what you see.....is NOT what you get at least for me.",1,1,2019-12-10,1,6,0
"I bought one of these on Black Friday and since day one, intermittent signal, it would not show me live view, it would disconnect from the modem and not work at all. I called Ring customer support and they tried to fix my issues. Spent 3 hours on the phone with a technician diagnosing all the issues such as going into my wifi router settings and reserving an IP for it and countless other things that I dont want to bore you with. In the end, they told me the problem was not the camera, it was my router because they were able to connect it through myCell phone hotspot. PLEASE, do yourself the favor and just order a replacement if you are having problems like me. As soon as I got my new replacement the new camera worked flawlessly. There seems to be quality control issues with some of these models especially the black Friday ones so make sure you get a replacement and dont take the Ring support “it’s your router” problem.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,7,0
"I spent near $500 for the Ring security system, doorbell camera, and a outside camera. Well, after hours of talking with support they said my device is faulty (as we could not get the light to spin for setting up the wifi). So I have to return that and try a new one. So, I decided to test out my outdoor security camera... this has to work right? WRONG, setup and updates went smoothly with the app saying I have a healthy internet connection. When going to live view however, it just gets stuck on ""Activating device"". The device is literally right next to my modem/router and base station and my download speed is 239.76 mbps and upload is 12 mbps... so the connection is not the issue. This has been a disaster and a big mistake for switching from Simplisafe. I wanted to use the ring as they had way more options for outdoor cameras.",1,1,2019-12-14,1,7,1
Be careful.  They recently changed the design and you can’t swivel it to mount on a roof. They want you to purchase a $20 kit.  They also don’t give you the tools anymore.  There is a reason why the price is a little cheaper.Not at all happy with the changes.,1,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
"I purchased this because I have the Ring Doorbell and it works great. I installed this camera above my Garage to watch my driveway and it works only about 25% of the time. It shows a strong signal but I cannot see the video stream on my phone even when I am on the same Wifi. The motion detection only works about 25% of the time.  I contacted Ring support and they had me try a variety of things that ended up just wasting my time. The camera still does not work properly and Ring support offered no solution what so ever. I guess I am stuck with a horrible product and wasted my money on this thing. It is the worst security camera I have purchased and I will be replacing it as soon as possible. It will not be another Ring device.UPDATE: I have figured out that this camera works ok as long as it is indoors. If you put it outside, it is just a round brick. Ring even sent me a replacement and it still does not work if outside. I got the solar panel with it but there is no reason to power a brick. I still say this product is horrible and a waste of money. Buy anything else for use outdoors. DO NOT BUY if you want something you can rely on. If I could give a rating of zero stars, I would.",1,1,2020-1-9,1,5,0
I’d say this camera is good if you just want to see what’s happening around your house. I wouldn’t depend on it for a major security purpose. I have this hanging from the overhang by my garage at an slight angle about 9 ft from ground.Daytime quality: Great.,3,1,2020-5-23,1,4,1

"I paid an electrician to install this outside on our garage wall, where no electric power was available. But I wasn't about to use a battery powered one that would result in me climbing a ladder to remove the battery, recharge it and then climb the ladder again to reinstall the battery. Long story short, this stick up cam only worked when it wanted to, which most often wasn't when I wanted it to. Said it was connected to my wi-fi, but kept blaming my phone. So...bought a Ring Spot Light cam (cost more) and replaced the Stick Up Cam...it works perfectly, as I would have expected. Also a better application as this area is not lighted at night. Must say Ring Customer Service, most notably, Heather, was outstanding...stuck with me while we tried different things to make the first one work. It didn't, but she is The Bomb.",2,1,2020-2-8,1,5,0
"Quite possibly the biggest disappointment for an Amazon purchase of 2019.  The App will give a notification to my phone that there is motion, but when I open the app to view what that motion is I get the spinning circle of death at least 80% of the time!  I had high hopes for this...  Its battery operated, video quality when working is decent, but the entire point of having a device like this is to be able to view the video (and in real time...).  This is 100% not the case here.  It is just a failure of execution.",1,1,2019-12-22,1,7,0
"Pros:1. Motion detection works well, if you set it up with motion verification, and once set, it picks up as soon as a corner of my coat was in the zone, so it records the whole motion, while the Arlo pro has serious lag sometimes records video with the person already left the view.",4,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0

"This is my third Ring camera (door bell, inside camera and now this outside camera), and I have become sold on Ring products.  This stick-up plug-in outside camera exceeded my expectations.  I mounted it on the side of the house under the eaves.  Physical mounting was very easy, and the cord was long enough to reach through the eaves to an outlet in the attic without needing an extension cord. The ball-and-socket joint in the mount allowed sufficient angle adjustment that I didn't need a separate mounting bracket.  The angle of coverage is generous, the image is crisp, and the Infrared night vision is incredible.  It's easy to connect to WiFi, although be advised: when first connecting, it upgrades the software and tells you it could take up to 5 minutes.  Mine took 10-15 minutes with a high-speed router, so be patient.  There is also a wide range of parameters for the camera you can set with the Ring app, making it even more versatile.  I highly recommend it.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"Have this on solar power.  So installed by the roof to get the sun, and away from tree. The application is unstable, and get confuse, when you use the scheduling mode. It never went back to normal after I used the schedule mode for motion. I did not sign up for the subscription. I purchased this late Oct 2019. I have the floodlight with the subscription. It was great in the beginning (installed 2017?) but the updated firmware, or what they claim enhancement, also caused the application to be confused. Was addressed to Ring, but the light quit turning on when motion is detected and recorded at night.  My issue is, when I changed network after getting a new provider. To change your wifi network, you have to press reset button on the camera that is installed way up there by the roof. I have other security cameras, I do not have to press any button to change the network name. It is all done in the app. Their excuse is for security. Really??? Your security of more revenue? Not mine, I just lost it. It could be worst if I climb up there and fall, for someone with the fear of height.",2,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"UPDATE: Shortly after my original post I discovered I had missed the detail about needing to purchase a ceiling mount in the Amazon ad...so that’s on me.

I will gladly do business with Ring in the future.ORIGINAL POST",1,1,2020-8-27,1,2,0
This is a not the same stick up camera I'm replacing. The old one has the ability to let you set up motion zones. This doesn't! You get 3 zones located across the bottom of the screen. Turns out you need to spend $200 to get that feature now. Ring Elite.I can't understand Amazon. They ship  $20 in garden hose parts in a box with padding but a $100 camera in a plastic bag.

"I got this because my neighbor and his guests are usually up all night making noise, have come on my property and broken into my car. The sheriff says I have no proof and is either too scared or lazy to answer a call. The deputy told me to get this camera, so I did.Since then, the neighbors have stopped parking their cars in front of my driveway and seem terrified by the very presence of my camera (he keeps adding layers to the fence). But other than that, it doesn't actually seem to work. I hear loud noises outside and try to see if anyone is there. It often takes 10 or more seconds for the ""live view"" to work, so if I did want to catch anything on camera, that time is lost. That's more than enough time for someone to completely pass by and go into the back yard undetected. Other times, live view just simply crashes. You just never know when its going to let you actually use it and see what's happening.",1,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0
"I initially wanted to use the camera mounted to the inside of a window to observe the front walkway and door.  Setup was easy.  The image clarity is excellent.  But the included instructions warn that camera performance will be degraded is used through a window.  In my case, I was using it through double glass.  I got an OK image, but the motion detection did not work.  Also, battery consumption maxed out at a week.  Not worth it in that particular application.  But the doc gives fair warning.But mounting the camera outside changed everything.  The image was sharper and clearer, and motion detection is excellent.  I even was able to back it down a bit.  The battery life is at about 3 weeks.  For some reason, the app on my iphone will often lag when I tap the image for a current view.  Sometimes, it times-out.  That isn't always reliable.  It's a problem.  I also have a Ring Doorbell cam that is always instantly updated.  What's the deal?  So, because of the application issue, I'll give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  Perhaps an app update will be coming along at some point.  By the way, it plays well with Alexa!",4,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"I am seeing a lot of negative reviews for this, but this is my experience!  I bought one of these to test out, and it works great. I hung it within the 30ft range from the wifi router, and it gets a clear a great signal.  It works as expected. I purchased 3 more for around the outside of the house and they all work great. You have to have a good wifi signal and they recommend if you don't, to use a repeater.  i don't have to do that in my circumstances (even though one of the cameras is located about 45 feet away and switches between weak and good signal.  I can perform all setting changes on my phone which is great, and i can see all 4 cameras - live at any time.  All my cameras are on the outside of the house.  I can remotely activate an alarm if necessary, I've tested it and it works.  I can talk through it as well.  You can specify separate zones within each camera and turn off motion detection using your phone if you happen to be doing yard work for instance and don't want it to record so it doesn't waste battery.  I love these cameras because my kids come home a few hours before i do from work and i can see them when they are outside the house.  If something were to happen, at least it will be recorded.  This won't prevent someone from breaking into my house, but they will sure as hell be on camera if they do.  Also, it will cost $3/month to use the cloud recording option, and if you have more than 3 cameras like I do, i recommend the $100/yr for that service.  It's worth it!",4,1,2019-10-29,1,5,0
"The (Stick-up Cam) product itself is excellent.  Well made, performs well, slick Apple-style packaging.  However...the fact that I have to pay Ring $3/month to record video is a major bait-and-switch.  I'm sure there was fine print describing this requirement, but I never thought to look for a feature that should be provided for free.  Why am I paying someone to access videos that are likely stored in a device that I own?  It'd be like buying a PC and paying HP a monthly fee to read my files.  The video record feature is essential for this device, so I'll have to pay the ransom.",3,1,2020-7-10,1,2,0

"1) The lack of customizable motion zones is a huge disappointment. If angled downwards, mounted ~9ft off the ground, it misses a lot of motion detection coverage towards the upper half of the lens. Wish it had motion zones similar to the Ring Doorbell Pro. Such a shame for an “all-new, gen 3” version of this camera. Is it wishful thinking to see a better motion detection zone coverage in future firmware updates?2) It stops recording too soon even with the motion verification feature turned off.",3,1,2019-11-6,1,7,0
"After having device for 4 months it started showing ""critical low battery"" on the app.  This is a constantly plugged in device.  I called Ring support and they told me first that they would turn it over to engineering, then told me that they were working on it and tried to give me two options.  The first was a ""work around"" to where I have to treat this device differently than the 3 other Ring products I have while I sit back and wait for them to do something to fix this.  The second option was to buy a new battery, to which I explained I would have to climb up on the side of the house to swap a battery that I had no idea was not going to put me back in this same situation 4 months from now.  Crappy support answer.  I've put in for a warranty replacement, will update after that process runs its course.",1,1,2020-5-23,1,4,0
"UPDATE:  Update - I updated my review from four to one stars.  Here's the reason why.  I have a RING Stickup and a RING Spotlight covering our pool and backyard.  Both are battery powered with attached solar units.  I've had some issue with the company that chemically treats our yard for weeds etc.  I knew they were coming a few days ago, so when I got home I pulled up the videos from our backyard (the aforementioned cameras).  One recorded him coming into the backyard but not leaving.  The other didn't record him or alert that someone had entered a motion zone (it was obvious from the one camera that he had in fact entered motion zones for both cameras).  I called RING Tech support and spoke with Mel.  Pleasant enough guy but not helpful. We started with the discovery my recorded length was 20sec when it should have been 30 which is the default.  I asked where I could change that and he gave me instructions, but the options he quoted were not available on any of my cameras.  He told me to delete the app and reinstall.  I did but still no joy.  He then said he could change it from their end.  Then we discussed zone settings and he said my RING Stickup camera had five zones with one turned off.  None of my cameras have five zones, they all have three.  I asked him for clarification and he repeated ""from my end, I see five zones on the stick up camera and one is turned off).  Now, how does he see five zones and I see three?  We then tried to trouble shoot why the cameras were detecting motion but not recording.  NO CLUE, said he would have to escalate the problem (means throw in the white towel) but said he would send me an email outlining our discussion and assuring me he would continue to trouble shoot.  Got the email - basically said I should consider two step authentication (which I already had set up).  Replied that I was not satisfied and the one time I really needed the RING to work, it didn't.  He did reply and restated he was going to continue troubleshooting the issue.  Long story short - three of my battery RING cameras have proven unreliable.  The only one that seems to work worth a darn is the wired RING door bell.  Total waste of money.Not an easy install because of the limited movement allowed by the base.  Speaker is terrible and this is for either hearing what is going outside or speaking to whomever is in camera range.  Would not buy this model RING again.",1,1,2020-6-30,1,2,0
"I didn't need a doorbell camera so I was looking for something I could mount somewhere on my porch.  Setup and installation was very easy.  The battery life has been great.  I turned off notifications, which is supposed to help with battery life.  The only 2 drawbacks I have seen is the Live Mode doesn't takes a while to come up, if it comes up at all, despite my router being less than 10 feet from the camera.  The router is indoors and there is an exterior brick wall between the router and camera, but that shouldn't be enough to degrade the signal as much as it has.  If I wanted to use live view to communicate with someone outside, I don't think it would be an effective option.  The other drawback is that the video quality isn't great when you zoom in.  So if someone walks by the house and does something to a vehicle, or the mailbox, it would be very hard to get enough detail to identify someone.  I still recommend the product though, just know it may have some limitations that could be a showstopper for some use cases.",4,1,2019-12-2,1,5,0
"Installed cam, and after it did its software update, got message that “battery is critically low”.  Interesting, as it is a WIRED cam. Got a hold of support, had me do a reset, which meant had to get ladder back out to go reset it.  When it first came up, no live video and after a second reset, got video, but critically low battery message still there. Can only get live view with my iPhone but not with iPad Pro. Deleted and reinstalled app, no joy. Joined a Ring Community thread and found that almost every cam has the same issues. I have been copied in on literally hundreds of emails from user’s experiencing same. This has now been almost 3 weeks and Ring, (an Amazon Company, I think), does not appear to have any ability to fix it, much less issue a statement on their site that acknowledges the problem. I have several other Ring products, and have been very satisfied, however, I won’t be buying any more products or recommend any until they get their act together.",1,1,2020-5-16,1,4,0
"IMHO Take your hard earned money you would have spent on this and get a better system.  They are finicky, connect and disconnect from the wi-fi randomly and by the time your live view pops up whatever you were trying to look at most likely has gone. If you enjoy spending time trying to get something to work and genuinely enjoy being frustrated this is the product for you.  If not, get something else.UPDATE:  In addition to adding a mesh system to the house, today I obtained a brand new modem from my service provider.  The signals to the cameras improved and I now have two of three cameras not working.  No live view.  They go on line and off line as they feel the need apparently.  DO NOT get these.  I recommended these to my neighbors when they worked good for about 4 weeks.  They ordered three and have since received them.  They are fighting the same battle I am already.  They’ve replaced routers twice and the modem.  They are looking to return theirs as well.  Had a co-worker who bought Arlos.  His internet is much much slower than mine and he has his cameras spaced further away from his router than I do, much further.  Guess what?  He has had no issues at all. ZERO!",1,1,2020-5-14,1,3,0
"I finally caved and bought the Plug-In version of the camera. After installation it shows an error message that the battery is critically low and live view is not possible. This is the PLUG-IN version and it does NOT include a battery. Googling the issue you'll find many people with the same problem. Ring gives this as the solution:""Confirm the device your have is the Stick Up Cam Plug-In, and that the battery is not installed in the device. If you have a battery operated Stick Up Cam, please create a new thread on your concern.",1,1,2020-5-25,1,2,1
"UPDATE 11/15/19:  I've had the camera for two weeks and overall it has performed fine with respect to recording and in freezing weather. The only issue with it is the battery life, if you are planning on putting this camera outdoors GET THE SOLAR PANEL! I've had it up without one because I wanted to see how long the battery would last after being fully charged and for our normal usage. The settings I have it on are: Motion Detection: ON, Motion Frequency: STANDARD, Motion Verification: OFF. Video Settings: Live View - ON, Tap Camera Preview - OFF, Audio streaming/recording - ON, Infrared Lights for Night vision - ON. I also have it linked to the front doorbell so that when it detects motion it triggers the doorbell to begin recording. The traffic in front of the house is steady but not crazy, normal subdivision. With these settings and at the 15 day mark of being up the battery on this camera is currently reading less than 10%. It's a shame that the battery life is on the ""meh"" side, so you either need to have another battery pack as a back up on stand-by or use the solar panel.  I'll be adding a solar panel and will report back how it goes with another update.------------------",4,1,2019-10-29,1,7,1
"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already.  I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't.  None.  Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways.  I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed.  Nope.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0
"In the past I purchased the first gen of the stick up cam for my driveway. Due to too much interference even with a WiFi extender, I ended up returning that camera. Now, due to someone or something in my backyard at 2am that my dog alerted me to, I decided to try this third gen. My back porch is much closer to the router so I was hoping it wouldn’t have issues.Let’s start off with what can be improved. Previous Ring items I purchased included the drill bits necessary to mount into brick and concrete. This does not. However, the nails and anchors to fit into the drill bit I used for the ring doorbell. But if you don’t have one of those, you would be out of luck and need to purchase a masonry drill bit set. As for the motion sensor zones, there are three fields of detection that you can turn on or off. I just wish the range went further. What would be even better is if the motion sensor detection could be customized just like the front Ring doorbell. Furthermore, wifi connection is just okay. Though I did expect better since the router was just 15-20 feet away from the camera. However, even when the signal was considered weak, the camera did happen to still go to live view quickly and capture and notify me walking out onto the porch. Lastly, the battery does take a long time to charge. About 4-6 hours. I do recommend getting a second battery so you have one on hand when one gets low. When the system first started up I got a notification that battery was low. I thought it was odd but it then it corrected itself and is at 100% charge.",4,1,2020-5-2,1,2,0
"I have a dozen of these Stick-Up cameras.  Ring use to be amazing, now they are Junk.  Terrible customer support. Good Luck EVER trying to talk to a live person.

I also have 18 Ring cameras at two locations.  All the outdoor cameras are located under eaves or overhangs, and work fine.  I tried locating one out in an unprotected area, and the first rain storm it flooded and no longer works properly. And yes, it was installed 100% correctly.

During this not-connecting period, the battery drains about 10% over night.Updated 11/13/2019: The camera continues to disconnect from my router for no apparent reasons (even when my router wasn't rebooted). This is the fourth time so far since Oct 26. Had to do a hard reset every time after waiting for more than 12 hours for the camera to reconnect. I have the camera up 10+ ft under the roof.

"I would have liked to give this camera a better rating.  While set up was made difficult due to the lack of a user manual, the video is excellent.  But BEWARE it will cost you at least $30 annually to see your video after the 30-day trial period ends.  Without the video, all you get is a notification of motion in the area of the camera.  Who needs a camera for that?  I would have expected at least some period of time for video retention to see the video and perhaps download it.  This is a deal breaker ... you should look for another camera manufacturer.",1,1,2019-10-30,1,3,0
"The new camera has a different setup for motion tracking.  It doesn't use the boxes, instead it uses an Arc that doesn't even extend to 1/3 the image at MAX setting.  It then has 3 zones within the arc that you can turn on or off.  My Ring Doorbell senses motion at 4x the distance. and can be customized much more.  I'm tempted to return this and just put another doorbell out there for better zone configuration.",2,1,2019-10-30,1,3,1

You now have to buy an additional ceiling mount. This could easily be solved in the software adding a feature to rotate the video. Of course they don't highlight this change anywhere.",1,1,2019-12-5,1,3,0
These do not work nearly as well as Ring's previous versions. The motion detection is HORRIBLE.

I do have another ring unit, a flood light/security cam and it is mounted outside and works both reliably and 24/7.  And on the same network as I attempted to use with  the Ring Stick-up cam 2.

"Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",5,1,2019-10-28,1,6,0
"Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,3,1
Camera performs as expected and works fine. I took away stars since this camera does not integrate with the ring alarm system. Currently there is NO WAY to get motion alerts or record motion ONLY when no one is home. You can schedule times but schedules change often. I don't need an alert and recording every. single. time. I enter a room...Idea that tons of people on the web are asking for: Have an option to record motion only if the ring alarm system is set to away mode! If this were available I would easily give 5 stars. If I had known about this issue I would not have bought the ring alarm system or the ring cam. I assumed a top tier company deeply invested in home automation would be on top of this.,4,1,2019-10-23,1,3,0
I rarely write reviews. I was really excited about this product so I ordered two. Just got them today and spent 3 calls with support and they don’t work as intended. I had a breaking on my property two weeks ago. Support tried to help with both and unfortunately hours later nothing. The issue for me is that the notifications barely work. It’s a hit and miss if they do. What’s the point if your devices do not get dependable motion notifications? Customer service was nice but unable to help at this point. I had been burglarized two weeks ago and was expecting that this would be great.This is my second review. I have to wait for an appointment next week after an email I received today. I didn’t go into full length yesterday because I was upset. First they told me my first device was defective and to open the second one and that I would get a replacement for the first after a hold of 1 dollar on my card. I wanted to test it looking out my living room window. I’ve had no alerts since at all. My neighbors kids came by and knocked on my door and nothing. If you want to watch a live camera all day and night this is for you. We come and go and I pay ADT to monitor my house. I’m angry because I lost a lot of tools and if this doesn’t do motion alerts whether home or not just find something else.,1,1,2019-10-23,1,1,0
"Updated review after 24 hours post-installation:I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with Ring’s new release. I pre-ordered this camera primarily due to the price and I now see why this model is $70 cheaper than the Gen 2 at regular price.",1,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0
The picture quality is great and the range seems to work well (mine are 50’ from my router).  My complaint is regarding battery life.  The product description says 3-6 months battery life.  Mine lasted 1 week.  The solution was buying solar panels to mount beside the camera.Purchased a 2 pk of solar panels for $66 from Wasserstein.  Ring wants $49 each and only had white available when I went online to purchase.  Overall I’m pleased with the cameras but the battery life is a scam.  Order your solar panel with the cameras.,3,1,2019-11-2,1,1,1
So the camera is okay if used outdoors. Read others reviews for why exactly indoor use is not great. The biggest disappointment when used outdoors is you cannot set specific motion notification zones like you can with the flood light cam or the other outdoor ring camera. All you can do is slide a sensitivity bar over a general area within the cameras field of view. Does it work...sure...but without zone control its not that great.,3,1,2019-10-23,1,1,0
"I have three other Ring devices and this is the first to disappoint. I just finished installing it and ran into a problem; The firmware sets a ""critically low battery"" warning, even though it has no battery. I purchased this one, like my previous one, to be hard-wired. And, it is. The software even acknowledges that it is a ""power outlet"" wired installation. The camera doesn't even ship with a battery.After going to Ring.com for support, I found hundreds of others with the same issue. Ring is not fixing the issue, claiming instead that their pandemic response is limiting customer service. Could not help but notice that their billing department seems to be working well and that my card was charged instantly. The only response from Ring that was in the same neighborhood was one suggesting to remove the battery and reinsert it.

I purchased these cameras before their release and was very excited to receive them. After my initial installation that went very well I began to become less and less pleased. My first and most frustrating issue is the motion detection zones. I completely understand how they work and how to adjust the parameters but their function does not match the settings. My street side camera which is pointed below the street with the motion zone 6'+ away from the street still picks up every car that drives by. My front door camera that has the motion controls maxed out will not pick up me walking down the sidewalk directly in front of it until I'm within 5' of the camera.  Both cameras have proven to be frustrating at best and mostly useless for their intended purpose. But they look nice...,1,1,2019-11-1,1,1,0

"After I wrote this review, I was contacted by Jason from Ring on 12/20/2019, who offered to resolve my problems.  One month, one replacement Stick Up Cam and one (free) Chime Pro later, we finally have a system that works! So Jason was fantastic, the system works well now, but it should NOT be this hard. I stick by my initial comments below - the regular support people were useless, and the Cam can be temperamental.  So my advice to purchasers of this product is that it works well when it works, but be aware you may need additional technology (e.g. a Chime Pro), and you may want to keep Jason (help@ring.com) in mind if you run into issues..._____________________________________________________________________________________",4,1,2019-12-19,1,9,0
"I've used a couple of the first-gen Ring Stick-up Cams for a couple of years now. For what I paid, they've done the job pretty well, alerting us to activity on our front and back porches, though the picture quality could be better. When I saw this new version with nice bells and whistles for a lower price, I jumped on it to install on the second story of our home to capture the backyard (we have that older stick up cam on the back porch for the blind spot created by the awning).Installation was much smoother than my first-gen cams as far as getting it prepared in the app, did not have any of the maddening issues that I had back then. Attaching the mount to the house was also simple. The camera took about 15 minutes to update its software and was ready to go. I like that I can link this camera to my existing back porch camera so that if it senses motion, the porch camera will automatically start recording, and vice versa.",4,1,2019-10-25,1,1,1
"I've been searching for almost 3months whats a better security cameras right now in the market and I found this. I taught this one will be the best one because of what it says on the description and reviews. But after having it for less than a month i'm experiencing issues everytime. First, I want to see my house while i'm away doing the Live View. After clicking on it, it always says Reconnect it only works once in a day but i tried million of times every singe day. Second, motion sensor is not working as well as expected. My family already park their car in the driveway and still not record the events and i did not get any notifications on my phone.Third, contact ring support for help for the first time and it works in that day. But the next day i'm experiencing again the Reconnect on Live view. If your buying a security camera find a better one. Im not saying that don't buy this camera, coz maybe the experience will be different on your end. I'm just sharing what issues i'm getting on this devices. Take a note, I always give good reviews for all the devices i'mbuying. But this is my first time i got so frustrated because the devices are not working as expected.

At first this stick up cam worked great for my front door but after I moved it to the bedroom area for some reason it stopped responding and kept getting an ip address conflict. My two other indoor cam and elite cam outdoors (which replaced this) had zero issues since day one. I even tried doing a hard reset and setting it up again. It started working fine after that but the fact that it started giving me these issues discouraged me from wanting to keep it.In doors? Get the indoor cam. Outdoors? Get the elite. The one thing I do like about this version camera is that it comes with a nice long cable that extends for power. I am not a fan of battery powered devices. I don't want to keep going back to a device to replace and recharge battery every few months for most of the day.,4,1,2020-7-12,1,1,0
Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes.  Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door.  The video quality is pretty good.  Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup.  Not sure why people couldn't set up zones.  It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps.  I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty.  Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back.  A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached.  Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected.  I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps.  They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed.  Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up.  Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!,5,1,2019-10-25,1,1,1
"I have a 2nd generation wired stick up cam.  I decided to add a second camera and bought this new version of the stick up cam assuming that there would be some improvements over the older version.  Boy was I wrong!  The new camera is inferior to the 2nd generation in every way.  The mount is a flimsy all plastic thing that can't be mounted overhead and allows for less adjustment than the old model. Instead of a dedicated outdoor power cord, this cam has a dual purpose cord with a connection in the middle that is guaranteed to allow moisture into  the cord.  The field of view of the camera is much smaller than the 2nd generation model and there's no way to adjust individual motion zones like you can on the 2nd generation.  There's no option to set this camera to person only mode either. So if you adjust the motion sensitivity higher you get an alarm for every cat and bunny rabbit that cruises by and if you set the sensitivity lower you can drive a truck into the driveway and the camera doesn't see it. All in all this New version of the stick up cam is one big disappointment. I'd send it back if it wasn't so much trouble to uninstall the thing.Update: My opinion of this camera hasn't changed but I would like to say that Ring customer service is excellent.  After my original review Jason at Ring emailed me and offered to help.  He offered to replace my camera with the older version of the stick up cam and I gladly accepted.  It's nice to do business with a company that believes in customer satisfaction.",1,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0
"I work with cameras, WiFi, mesh gear, microwave technology, 4G, etc.  I stream audio and video and work with complex systems.  Every time I read a Ring forum person write in about a Ring issue, Ring never accepts blame.  My Ring doorbell signal is less than my stick up cam and it works great.  I am on my second stick up cam, and it has serious flaws. Let’s just say, I can push WiFi down my street, but a stick up cam in the same room, as my router, doesn’t get a decent signal!  Folks, we have here a company that has failed to get the bugs out of their firmware.  The doorbell works fine, the indoor cam mounted in the garage works fine, all my other cams works fine, but a simple stick up cam doesn’t.  No Ring, there are not too many devices on my network, I turned them off just to see if your excuse was even viable.  Bottom line is your firmware needs work, a lot of work, even your motion detection has issues, video playback has issues and it’s only on the stick up cam.  How do I knows this?  Let’s just say, when you try one cam, and it doesn’t work at all, you call Ring and talk real tech, they say send it back and get another, that tells me it’s an issue with the devices, especially when the second one starts up fine then begins to have issues.  I even borrowed another indoor cam, and tried it, it worked fine.Stop pointing the finger at people who buy this and blame them for its issues.  It appears your older generation device stick up cams work better.  There is a flaw somewhere in the string of code and every new one going out and getting updates will have these issues.  I would have bought several of these, but they don’t work.  Thankfully I can fall back on other competitor devices in the mean time till you get it right.  Don’t be ashamed to stand up and say you made a mistake, stop saying it’s people’s internet or WiFi strength, maybe your WiFi  receiver or antenna in the stick up cams has the issue.  I can stream some serious bandwidth at 30fps, and not even lose a frame, but yet a $99 camera can’t even stream 5’ from router with serious upload and download speeds.  Like I said before my doorbell works perfect, maybe I should mount a few of them around the house, flush them into a concealment, and disable the button.  I bet no one has used multiple door bell and small hidden cams yet.  They seem to work great!  Why is it I can walk down to my mailbox with a streaming WiFi camera I have, and your stick up cam, and the stick up cam drops out, yet my other camera doesn’t?  No it’s not arlo, it’s a simple WiFi based camera.  Go figure, I bet you got a deal on some second rate WiFi receivers and board antennas hoping 50% or more worked, just look at the amazon feedback, that should support my argument.  That’s all.....",1,1,2019-12-3,1,9,0
"It was easy to set up and is a great companion to my Ring doorbell on the front of the house. It has an excellent field of view and the image itself is very good.Now for the bad: it lost all WiFi connectivity overnight and I have a strong WiFi signal where the camera is located. When I set it up again, it downloaded updates again. This would seem to suggest there were new updates today, even though it grabbed updates when installed yesterday.",3,1,2019-10-24,1,7,0

Updated:If you purchase a WiFi extender and place it right near the camera it does get a better signal.  T he y should disclose this information in the description.  Kind of annoying you have to buy extra equipment for this.  The whole purpose is for it to be wireless meaning nothing plugged in.  Kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless WiFi if you still need a WiFi device placed within a few week.  If they’d work on this glitch it could easily be a 5-star product.  3-stars for all the issues and complications.  It does work better now with the WiFi extender.,3,1,2020-2-25,1,2,1
"I have a Netgear Nighthawk router and Netgear modem (100mbps download, 13 mbps upload, strong signal across my home and property) with a Ring security system and video doorbell and no previous connection issues with any other devices. I purchased two Ring stick up cameras, both of which failed to connect to my wifi network during set-up; at the point during setup where it attempts to connect to the wifi network it would fail with the message ""unable to connect due to a problem with your internet"" and flash a red-blue light. I methodically followed all the troubleshooting guidance on the Ring help page but this did not resolve the connection problem so I contacted Ring support, who simply followed the same troubleshooting process. After two separate calls with Ring support I was advised that there must be something wrong with the camera units and to exchange them. After exchanging for two new cameras I encountered the exact same connection failure and had no choice but to give up and return the cameras as both the troubleshooting guidance on Ring's website and technical support were not able to provide an explanation for the failure.There is clearly some compatibility issue with my system/system components and the Ring stickup cameras that Ring's troubleshooting page and technical support is incapable of addressing. Given that other Ring components and every other device I use connects well, I have good network connectivity with settings in-line with Ring's setup instructions, and new modem and router, I have to assume that the problem lies with the camera design or software. After reviewing several online forums it seems that others are experiencing similar connection problems, so once again suggests poor design on Ring's part with this camera. It also seems that Ring technical support is essentially incapable of providing any help beyond what is already listed on the troubleshooting website, so if you've gone through the troubleshooting webpage I would suggest not wasting time calling the support line. In the end I wasted several hours troubleshooting this connection issue and would suggest to others that they simply cut to the chase and return the camera if they run into similar connection issues during setup.",1,1,2020-1-18,1,3,0
"I got a pair of cameras and mounted them in front of my garage, perhaps 25 feet from my WiFi router.  Couldn't get them to connect to the router at all. I was able to put my phone near the cameras in airplane mode and then connect to the router without an issue. It even claimed to have a full three rings of signal, but I'm not sure how meaningful that is. I bought a Chime Pro repeater to help boost the signal that I originally installed about half way between the cameras and the router. That was good enough for an intermittent connection, but to get a reliable connection I had to get an extension cord and move the Chime Pro to the other side of the wall where the cameras are mounted. Now that it's only about 6 feet away from the cameras (closer than the power warts that are separated from the cameras by an 8 foot power cords, so I'm I'm sure I have the distance right) everything finally works reliably. But a WiFi range of 6 feet seems incredibly short even when that 6 feet includes an exterior wood frame wall.The motion detection isn't remotely as nice as the Ring doorbell. The camera has three zones (left, center, right) that can be individually turned on or off, rather than the user drawn polygon of activity in the doorbell. Even with ""motion verification"" turned on, one of the cameras is constantly triggered by blowing leaves that appear in all three of the available zones. So I turned off alarms for this camera and now I get lots of nice videos of blowing leaves and the occasional car or person in that part of the driveway. Fortunately I was able to adjust the other camera so that it had a useful motion zone with many fewer leaves that only rarely trigger the camera.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0

At this point, they are ""going to get back to me"" with a possible fix.  I am not sure what they intend to do, but it is very obvious they cost reduced this new version with a severe impact in reliability and functionality.

"Update 30OCT (original review and first update follow this): I changed my recommendation opinion and recommend the camera now.  It doesn’t have the best FOV so the motion detection isn’t the best, but if you utilize the camera to the best of it’s abilities (i.e. don’t try to use the camera mounted high to cover large swaths or property but rather keep it at ~7ft to cover your back porch or something) it does a decent job. It’s a cheaper camera compared to Arlo or some of the other Ring models so you should manage your expectations of it’s performance.The WiFi signal strength has been sufficient. I initially thought I may have a problem but they seem to be working fine. That’s not to say that a Chime Pro wouldn’t help since I’m on the lower end for signal strength.",4,1,2019-10-25,1,8,1
"I purchased three of these to use in our children’s nursery and living room. The battery life is advertised to last 6 months, however we have to charge our batteries WEEKLY.

2-15-20 updateThis ring step stick up camera has frustrated me beyond anything I could ever begin to tell you. After going around with the ring every single day this past week I finally found a technician who somewhat started to make sense. He felt it was my internet speed so initially he said it was the upload speed And then after that didn't work he then said it was the download speed. But I do believe we were in I contacted my internet provider and I had them increase my download and my upload speed That did not work Then today I had them send a technician out to look over what was going on with my wireless box my wired box my router and outside aspects.the right He spent 2 hours here He rewired he changed out boxes He replaced my modem to the most current modem they have and I am pleasantly surprised to say that everything has been working for the last 10 hours. That is the longest that camera has worked. So quite obviously it was my internet. I just wished ring instead of keep sending me out cameras had initially said you know your Wi-Fi it could be your Wi-Fi and that isn't what occurred up until the last couple of conversations. So if you're having issues with that stick up camera it could be your Wi-Fi. My ring doorbell has been perfect from day one never an issue That was wired this stick up camera is solar I don't know if that has anything to do with it but truly the issue was my Wi-Fi so I wanted to be able to update everybody. Cuz my last couple have not been very nice or very good. So I love the ring stick up camera premise it is now working great and I upgraded my star review to four stars.

"I purchased the 2 Pack of the Ring Stick Up Camera Plug-In, but I have only put up one of them at this point (long story). However, I wanted to write this review because I felt doing so might help some others trying to decide if they should buy Ring or not.  First thing I have to say that when you receive something from Ring the packaging screams quality. No cheap of flimsy box; everything that is in the package is well protected and yet easy to get out.Before I installed the camera I ordered a battery for backup. After installing the battery I set the camera up following the directions. The Ring android app made it extremely easy to get the camera connected to my network. Once that was done I took the camera outside and found the location where I wanted to install it based on the area of view I wanted covered. By the way, I did order one of the Ring ceiling mounts for it, but the more I looked at the area I wanted it to cover the more I realized that I could use the mount that came with the camera.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,1,0

"We have owned Arlo, Nest ,Samsung and Logitech security cameras in the past.  But the latest Ring Security Camera is the best in several ways.  For one it’s the easiest to setup.  You just open the app and turn on the camera. The Ring App walks you through setup with the fewest steps. Two, the Ring Security System is the best especially when paired with Ring Home Monitoring.  We have tested the Arlo Pro against our Ring Camera and the video play back from the Ring is superior. Three, works great with both Alexa and Siri.The night vision for the Ring is great but not the best of the four different cameras we used.  Arlo Pro surprised us since everything else was far behind Ring.  We have owned the Drop Cameras in the past and tried the new Nest Camera.

"I thought it wasn’t going to be that good from the reviews I read but this camera beat my expectations, it’s clear, the night vision is awesome, you can set zones for motion detection and you get invited to see all the stuff other ring members post that live in your area. Some of it is really funny. Overall I’m extremely happy with purchase, I will most likely buy another one for the back yard",5,1,2019-11-18,1,4,0
"I have several Ring products and this one integrates well, and surprisingly doesn't blow through batteries. I'm sure other peoples mileage will vary on that. The only thing that loses a star is the reduction of the motion detection to the standard pie vs the enhanced. I didnt expect the better motion detection on the battery version but I since the wired version no longer has it I feel compelled to deduct a star.  Perhaps thats because this cam although it works well covers the area adjacent to my GEN 1 cam that has the better motion detection and thus a constant reminder.  Besides would it be horrible to have better motion detection on the battery version?",4,1,2020-1-25,1,2,0
"Unfortunately Ring doesn’t work through a window, get a Nest Cam (formerly DropCam) camera for that.  This was my third Ring camera and the other two are outside which work fine. I tried to use the “Stick-up” Cam through my inside window to outside.  Didn’t work so I researched and Ring says motion detection doesn’t work through a window. Live view will work, but that’s not why I bought it.  They should disclose that in their description. Ring has a much lower price for monitoring, but it costs in video quality and information as it is “incident” driven in recording intervals. Nest monitoring storage is more expensive, but it is continuous recording.  You don’t miss anything and it works through a window.  I’ll keep my Rings, but there are reasons I have both systems.",3,1,2020-6-20,1,2,0
"Finally got the system working, but we encountered issues that we had to troubleshoot. Contrary to the majority of reviews, for us it was a nightmare to get proper support for the setup process  Once we charged up the units and initially started the app setup, we got great video image of the area we wanted to cover. Then, in getting the app set following what seemed to be clear and simple steps, no more video image.  Called support, which gave us various troubleshooting suggestions, none of which resolved the problem. After nearly an hour with support, the call dropped. She didn't call us back. So we went to google to see if there was any useful guidance.  Nope, that is a dead end. It took us about 10 hours to finally get the system up and running.  BTW:  Our WIFI signal is strong. And yes, we did charge the units fully, which took over 10 hours.",3,1,2020-3-21,1,1,0
"The camera is working fine so far. I have the ring doorbell. I can monitor the doorbell on my laptop but when I installed the outdoor camera, it showed up on my phone but I can not monitor it on my laptop. Ring support says they are working on the issue but I don't believe them. Time will tell. They don't seem to care that people use these devices at home and laptop monitoring is a much simpler way to monitor and control your devices when you are at home. I know the two devices are linked to my account because every time I go to the app on my laptop the 30 day free subscription countdown is shown at the bottom of the screen. I know this is a review for the camera but it all is part of a complete system if you don't have the option of monitoring on a laptop and a phone then I guess I will have to look elsewhere for a camera that can be monitored on a laptop. This shouldn't even have to be an issue in this computer age, but it is.Update: Ring support contacted me. They corrected the windows app for viewing my camera on my laptop. I will raise my rating two stars. The customer service was very quick and responsive. Only reason for not giving the camera 5 stars is there are still minor bugs in the camera. Picture quality is grainy. It could be my internet connection but the ring doorbells picture (connected to the same network and about the same distance from my router) is much better.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,2,0
"Luis, Ring’s Amazon executive community Support representative reached out to me after I posted a negative review I guess in a futile attempt to persuade me to change the review, he wasn’t able to reimburse me for lost time, money, or patients I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone honestly, I received my camera and solar panel, placed the solar panel on top my roof in direct sunlight, charged the battery, and mounted the camera, only to have it die a few hours later, this happened twice, both times I called customer support I was connected to someone who barely spoke English, was of no help whatsoever in sending me a new battery, the second time my camera died it allowed someone to break into my car, fed up I had to climb up on the roof, take down the camera, and bring it to a UPS store in the middle of the hood, terrible experience altogether",1,1,2020-8-13,1,1,0

"Motion detection, WiFi signal and night vision are great, my problem is that I purchased a “PLUG IN” stick up camera that after a while it’s showing a “low battery” message and because of that message, it’s not allowing me to connect to live view. I contacted Ring support and they couldn’t fix the problem and could not understand why it’s giving me a “low battery” message, so their fix is to send me a battery to install in the plug in camera. If the camera is a plug in and should be working properly without the need of a battery, what’s going to happen when the battery goes low, I guess I will have to recharge a battery for a plug in camera. They announce this as a plug in stick up cam, they should have stated that even thou it’s a plug in it’s going to need a battery. I am very disappointed with this purchase, I have other Ring products and they work fine but this one is disappointing, that’s why I give it a 2 star rating",2,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0

"I have the Ring alarm system. This is the first camera I've added.Overall, I'm impressed based on the week+ that I've used it to monitor my front yard/porch. Image quality is great and it seamlessly integrates with the Echo Show family of products. I have not experienced issues with motion detection -- it has been consistent, day or night.  It was a matter of finding the ""sweet spot"" that provided good coverage but not so much that cars/street traffic were triggering the detection. I also like the fact that there is an option to have the camera powered by plug plus battery for backup.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,3,0
"UPDATE 4/21/2020 : It has taken some time, but with the assistance of Ring technical support (who contacted me, I did not have to contact them), I have finally managed to get the cameras working in an acceptable manner, it just takes trial and error, and most importantly, *a good wifi signal*.Motion detection technology itself still has room for improvement and I believe my initial expectations may have been a bit unrealistic. I did upgrade my router to a Netgear Nighthawk and that did noticeably improve my signal strength, which has resulted in more reliable and consistent recording; I strongly encourage you to test your wifi strength at the locations you have decided to mount the cameras, and if your reception is weak you should be prepared to either upgrade your router, add a mesh or repeater, or be willing to live with subpar performance from your camera.",4,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"Just like the blink camera, you can walk up to 15 feet away from this. wave your arms like an idiot, and it still doesn't set off the motion detector. My friend rode his motorcycle up my driveway, and it still didn't detect him However, a car 50 feet away going at least 30 miles an hour sets it off every time. So I'm not finding it horribly effective in terms of informing me when someone is on my property. I do like the quick snapshot photos it takes, since that would be the only way I would be able to see a trespasser.I also find the audio to be equal to that of the  Blink camera. But I found the shape of this camera difficult to position. I didn't want to drill a hole in my well so I was looking for something that I could just hide in the bushes. Again here I'd vote for Blink because there are some adapters to use to attach the camera without drilling into your wall.",3,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
I am having the same issue as DL Ward with the battery version.  I even tested near my AP but got the same results with the camera going into some type of stupor and not staying connected to WiFi.  I use three Orbi mesh APs in my house and this thing can't even stay connected.The live video feed also would not work at all and the cameras would stop pinging after about 5 minutes.  I tested three different units.  All are going back.,1,1,2020-2-14,1,3,0
"I love the ring stick up cams. I bought one at first just to test it out and by the second day I bought another. Easy to link into the app, install takes a minute or two, and the battery lasts a while. I’ve had mine since the 22nd of June, so about three weeks, and the battery level is at 87% still. These pick up almost too much activity which isn’t a problem for me, but for someone who has pets running around or on a busy street, this could constantly pop up with the “motion detected” too often perhaps.Fine tuning the motion settings is fun too. You can disable certain quadrants in the zone or you can increase/decrease the sensitivity.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"The picture quality is good, the motion detection is good, setup was easy.  The biggest issue I have had with this camera and the ring doorbell is you need an exceptionally strong wifi signal for these things to work.  Forget it if you have guests at the house and other devices are being used that are connected to the wifi.  I have the best wifi you can buy for a residential home.  Initially it was hit and miss whether or not this camera or my ring doorbell would work with live connect.  Motion detection worked fine, but if I wanted to use live view, it would only connect 50% of the time at best.  I don't have a large house and the units were not more than 20 feet from my wifi modem/router.  Granted there are walls between, but the distance was not far.  To get these things to work consistently on live view I had to move mi wifi pods closer to both devices and now they work for live view most of the time.  Just beware they are not just setup and use if you plan on using the live view feature to monitor your surroundings.  The picture quality is much better than my old 720P wired cameras.  I just wish they didn't need a super strong wifi signal to work.  Also, it takes a few seconds for them to activate so a lot of the time you don't get the initial video of the person walking by.  You see him as he walked by already.",4,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"7/31 Update: I waited out to see how long the batteries would last after having to ch age the settings. It’s the 11th day today and the batteries have died so I’m stuck with no ring surveillance while I’m having to recharge them. If this is their way of forcing you to purchase additional batteries and waste more money. Shame on ring! Honestly save your money! Invest in something better!7/21/2020:  I purchased 3 of these cameras. After much research they just seemed the best option with the best reviews. However, now I feel pretty fooled. We’ve installed 2/3 cameras and I’ve noticed their motion detection isn’t good. I had my settings set at standard recommendation which is what is recommended to apparently conserve battery life. However, today just one day after installation I noticed these cameras will not catch important footage if someone were to break in to my home at a quick motion. I received a notification of motion when my husband entered our home and when I reviewed the image all it had caught was the door closing. It did record me right after entering behind him but it totally missed his entranced. Now I went and adjusted the motion settings to More frequent However I was instantly warned it will shorten my battery life by doing so. The whole purpose of me buying the cameras was to feel safer knowing the cameras will aid with surveillance. I did feel safe after installing them But after today’s motion detection incident I really am disappointed. I did increase the frequency to see whether that will help with the motion detection. However, I’m pretty concerned with the battery life. I tried looking up back up batteries and that’s another  $30 for each camera I’d have to waste. Now I’ve already paid 120$ for each camera and it’s mounts. Not to mention I will have to pay monthly for the cloud. I’m really debating returning these cameras. At this point I wouldn’t recommend. Also I’d like to mention the camera doesn’t seem to detect shorter people at standard frequency. I’m 5’2  and it won’t detect me unless I’m with my husband who’s 5”11.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,1
After 3 months of use I would give this product 3/5 stars. The camera overall is a great value but there are some shortcomings.First it's strengths is that is provided a decent picture rated at 1080p especially during daylight. I had no problem connecting to WiFi currently using a nest wifi router. If you have a ring doorbell and Amazon show; product intergration is good. Alexa can show video feeds in about 5 seconds average for me. Ring app is good and neighbor app is ok.,3,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0

"I got these to replace some cheapo $40 cameras I had bought from Amazon. They were ok and did the job but I just wasn't that happy with them. I was looking at going with Nest but they are just crazy expensive, $200 or more per camera?!?! I had four cameras total and that was still $40 cheaper than just one Nest cam. But, you do get what you pay for. Those took forever to connect on the app, their desktop app didn't even work at all and were powered by USB ( at least the ones inside) which made me have to use an extension cable and have ugly cables going everywhere. I thought I'd give these cameras a try since they were battery powered. I was a little concerned since they weren't recording 24/7 but after actually using them, it's not that big of a deal. The motion detection works pretty good and the fact that you can view live video almost instantly is great (the cheapo cameras took FOREVER to connect). Plus, the video quality and field of view is fantastic. I'm sure the more expensive cameras probably have a better field of view but honestly, these are great for the money. I am extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend this camera if you're looking for the middle ground camera (better than the cheap Chinese cameras but not as expensive as those $250+ cameras), also has the benefit of being wireless. Oh and on that, I've had them installed with some pretty heaving motion detection and have gone down only 6% for the cameras outside over two weeks and the inside cameras 10% (a lot more activity).",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
After installing a new entry door on our home we decided to get into the camera doorbell game. We decided on the ring 2 doorbell. It worked so well that we decided to ditch our Front Point security system (still under contract mind you and paying monthly) and go all in with Ring ( security system full protection option/ doorbell / two stickup cams . We wanted full video surveillance outside of our home and went with the ring stick up cam plugin x’s 2 (latest edition). Set up was a breeze as I would have expected. I am kind of a tech nerd so to speak and generally understand technology. Worked well for around 7 hours then the trouble began. In almost 30 days I have yet to go a full 24 hours with both stick up cams running and not dropping out. I have spent two to three hours on the phone with Ring ( very responsive btw). This is on top of 8-12 hours troubleshooting on my own. I spent the amount of time I did because I wanted these to work so bad. They elevated my troubleshooting to the upper level and the same issues are happening. All they say is that it’s a network issue. I have a an rsssi (WiFi strength number) of 40 to a high of 50. Every time the cameras  go to “sleep” I have to get out a 8 foot ladder in Ohio winter mind you  and unscrew the bottom and put in set up mode and start all over. . I got the plug ins for this reason so I would not have to go out climb ladders and recharge batteries. I have zero issues with the doorbell dropping out. The WiFi  mesh system In my home works flawlessly. The tech support leaned towards blaming the mesh but I’m sorry more than 30 devices in my home say otherwise . Never ever an issue. I will not be changing my network for two bad apples that won’t perform. Fortunately I am within my return window.  Unfortunately I cannot deal with the performance and will have to return. What’s the point of video security if they only work intermittently. Sad.,1,1,2020-1-21,1,2,0
"Updated Review (3-3-20)In response to my original review, Jason (Executive Community Support Representative) reached out to assist us with finding a resolution to our issues.  Long story short, he (and Ring) did step up BIG time to find a satisfactory solution ... in the end we were provided with a 100% refund of our purchase as requested since we had already replaced the original camera with another due to not being able to get it to work, despite trying all the measures recommended to revive it.",4,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0

This should be illegal! Nowhere does RING tell you Video quality will be lower and NOWHERE do they tell you that without subscribing most of the time you will get a TRY AGAIN LATER......so I went and subscribed AND INSTANTLY the quality was better and no more problems connecting.

"Set-up was fine, no problems.  Left it on overnight to see how it did on it's own.  After about two hours it died.  Battery was good, it just shut off.  No motion detection obviously.  Not what I want from a security camera.  Called Ring support, they're clueless.  All they can do is read a drop-down menu and if that doesn't fix it then return it.  They really don't care.Update:  Believe it or not but Ring representatives actually DO read reviews.  I was contacted via email by a nice gentleman from Ring politely inquiring about my review and what was my problem with the device.  We had a nice chat and he did offer his disappointment that their product failed me.  Ring is a good product and their prices and plans are about the best out there, IMHO.  He was gracious enough to offer me a discount should I care to give them another try.  After my current upset subsides I probably will.  I'm a magnet for glitches in the matrix and feel I did get a defective product; it happens, to me mostly.  I'll purchase another Ring camera and see how that goes.  I have hope.  Ring is a good company; many friends and relatives have their devices so they do come highly recommended as well.  Will edit review as events play out.  Final word:  Purchased another Stick Up Battery Cam and Chime Pro for wi-fi extender.  After about a half hour on the phone with customer support - and I got excellent customer service - and a very nice lady explained how to make it all talk together.  Perfect!  Would certainly recommend Ring for quality products.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"Great cameras.PROS- The line of site is great. The quality of the picture/video is very good. You have to play around with the settings to get the correct angle, motion detection and proper notification as with any camera. Overall the function of a security camera is perfect.

"This camera absolutely does not detect motion from 20-30 feet away as they advertise. I am literally standing in front of the camera waving at it and it’s not even turning on. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with their technical support and they were unable to solve the problem. We adjusted motion settings and frequency, etc. The best they could offer was 5-10 feet away (Which doesn’t even happen most of the time) and essentially told me it is what is. I bought 6 of these junk cameras that are completely worthless when it comes to motion detection. The only good thing about them is live view, which works well. It was very clear that they have no solution to the motion detection problem and do not care to devise a solution.",1,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0
"UPDATE: After posting this review with 2 stars I received an email and a phone call from a Ring rep who wanted to help me with my issues.  I am techno ignorant and he walked me through increasing the frequency of the recording so it will record more of the motion.  With all the ""social distancing"" and ""self isolation"" we have at the moment nothing has crossed the path of our cameras except a deer and a squirrel so I can't say yet how the adjustment has worked out, but I am increasing my stars to 3 based on the responsiveness of Customer Service.  I'll update again later when we all come out of our caves.We purchased 7 of these cameras at $100/each giving us coverage all around the outside of the house. They were easy to set up etc, the picture/video quality is good BUT once each camera detects motion it records for 30 seconds only.  It certainly doesn't show the beginning to end motion activity. So, when our local burglar approaches our house we only see 30 seconds of his treachery, instead of it recording until the motion stops.  When I posted this issue on line I found people who said to change the motion frequency to ""frequent""and then the time would increase somewhat (another 30 seconds?) but I can't find any such setting. That is insufficient anyway. It needs to record until the motion stops.  We were going to buy a couple more and perhaps later an alarm system, but won't throw good money after bad and will find another product.",3,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0

The indoor cams does this flawlessly , the outdoor one doesn’t even have an icon to flip it in the ring app, it did until it applied the firmware update. I opine they discovered it wasn’t waterproof when oriented upside down in the rain and rather than redesign this version , they sold them as is while hoping that no one would notice or try to mount it upside down. I oriented it right side up with a camera bracket , it’s under the soffit so the weather doesn’t matter. Just beware ; it’s not as advertised. But it works pretty well. Never put ring cameras in private areas ( or any camera for that matter ).",3,1,2020-2-16,1,1,0
"I’ve been happy with my Ring Doorbell so I went ahead and preordered this. The picture quality is better than my doorbell. The motion notifications however are not working at all. I have not received one since I waived my hand in front of it while setting it up. This is setup looking out my back window and a high traffic area for my family and it has not captured one thing since it’s been installed. Reading other reviews, it appears others have had this problem as well. Hopefully this is a bug that can be fixed.",2,1,2019-10-24,1,3,0
"4/8/20 Update:This is the final update.  The firmware upgrade resolved my issues.  It is working fine.  So I upgraded my review to 5 stars.  Here is the bulleted summary.  The original review, and the previous update, appear below unedited.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"I have the Ring doorbell and that works flawlessly.Ring stick up camera? Not so much. Battery life is awful and I have everything set to conservative as possible. Cannot even go 2 days. I have re-charged the battery, same problem. Running the latest update and it has made no difference. You also cannot set up a modified detection mode for motion, you can only reduce the sensitivity which again stinks as at night, I would like it to catch something.",1,1,2020-6-1,1,2,0
"Horrible horrible battery life!! DO NOT BUY the wireless version! I had it charged 100%, and it died within 24 hours!! I installed the camera at 4pm and the following morning the battery had already died! I was shocked! How was I supposed to keep my house safe with this useless battery life?! I also bought the solar panel and didn't charge much even with DIRECT sunlight for several hours. It supposed to keep the battery charging 1 to 2 percent per day. I didn't see any good having the solar panel for that. So returned all the wireless cameras and solar panels. Don't waste your time and money on these products!I was so excited to read all the positive reviews only to find that I was immensely disappointed in both the wireless stick up cam and solar panel duo. I don't get how they have such positive reviews!!",1,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
"I bought these to combat a couple of trespassing neighbors that wouldn’t heed my warnings, and after installing them, I haven’t had any issues. In fact, they’ve helped me alert the police to suspicious activity in my neighborhood. The only thing that I don’t like is that you can’t adjust the motion sensitivity in individual directions. So, you may pick up your neighbors movements depending on how close they are to you. You can block out your neighbors windows if they’re in view of the camera though. The camera will switch to night vision when it gets dark, but if you have it installed near a light source, and you have motion sensing lights, footage will be recorded in color. Another great feature is the ability to link the cameras. If motion is detected by one camera, and someone or something walks out of view, the other camera will begin recording. The battery life is good, that’s dependent on how you have your cameras set up. If you have motion sensitivity set high, look at live view a lot, or have a lot of heavy traffic, those options will drain the battery faster. I would recommend getting extra batteries anyway to avoid having your cameras offline. Also viewing footage while you’re away from home is easy and gives you a piece of mind knowing what’s going on when you’re away from home. Ring cameras are the perfect compliment to a good home security system of your choosing.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0
"Update 05/29/2020:Got the new replacement cameras from Ring.  However, one of the cameras they sent could not get through the setup.  Called support and they could not get it to work either.  At this point, there is no point continuing this.  It is my view that this model of camera from Ring has serious issues and should not be on the market.  Jason from support sent me return labels and I will be returning to Ring for a full refund.  Good on them for giving me a full refund, but they obviously have some serious issues.  Obviously my one star review will have to remain one star.",1,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"I really wanted these cameras to be all that they were advertised to be.  I received them a little over a month ago and hurried to get them charged and installed.  At the time of setup I saw that they had a poor signal.  I couldn’t believe it because I have a mesh network installed with a very strong and fast connection.  I literally have one of my nodes that is 6 feet away and another probably 50 or so feet away.  The camera says RSSI 66 and I have completely drained a battery one time and am at 38% now within less than a month.  Really disappointed in these.  I am also less than impressed with the cameras at night... they seem to work good when it is really dark, but if there is any light, they do not work well.",2,1,2019-11-25,1,2,0
"First, there was no way of knowing what generation of wired stick up camera I purchased. After I received, I must have Generation 3. Problems with this generation is that it only works with 2.4 WiFi and there is no adjustment for the motion area like I have on the door bell. ( The little handles you can grab to select the exact motion area). I have a Ring alarm system with the ring doorbell and was trying to keep it all the same. I purchased a wired stick up camera. Now even with a WiFi extender the camera response is crap.  I get alarms every time a car goes by because I cant adjust the alert area and  when I do get an alert, it takes me a minute for the video to process. To connect the lights with the rest of the ring system, you have to buy a bridge. I think they are terrible software designers who can't figure out how to integrate their components to work together so they make the consumer buy extra crap to make it all work. Now they introduce products and take features away on subsequent generations. Normally new generations of products are better than the previous generation. With Ring they seem to be worse. Bridge for the lights to work with the cameras, WiFi extender Chime for the cameral to conect because the receiver in the camera is soo bad.  I am stuck with the Alarm but this terrible camera is going back!!!!",2,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0

"I was really expecting much more from this security camera. Sometimes it’s good and other times it’s like I don’t even have a camera. It pretty much catches what it wants. I get a lot of suspicious cars driving by the house so I like to catch everyone who passes. Sometimes this camera picks up a car and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s like it chooses when it wants to work or not. The battery also dies fairly quickly. I only have had my camera for close to 2 weeks and already have to charge the battery. I am planning on getting a solar powered battery charger to avoid going up and down the ladder to recharge the battery, but having it die only after 2 weeks is just ridiculous. $100 is a bit steep for a camera that doesn’t even really work the way a security camera should. I also wish the recordings were longer than 30 seconds, usually you miss a lot of action after that time period has passed. The night vision at night is good though and I like the volume on it and the fact that you can talk both ways. Overall though, this camera still needs a lot of work. Back to the drawing board guys!",2,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Summary: The WiFi Range on this thing is comically short! 12-15 ft WiFi range assuming there are no solid walls! Unusable outdoors.I bought this camera to use outdoors to monitor the side entrance to my house. My WiFi is in the dead center of my 2100sf home. Setup was easy and the camera seemed to work great... when it was in the same room as my WiFi router. I first noticed connectivity issues when I brought it outside to mount it at the side entrance. It would not connect. No live views whatsoever. I brought it in to troubleshoot and noticed that it still wouldn’t connect when I was in my dining room! Mind you, I could literally SEE my WiFi router from where the camera was... about 20 feet away. I get on the phone with customer service and ask what the WiFi range was. Their answer... 12 TO 15 FEET UNLESS THERE IS A SOLID WALL... IN WHICH CASE IT IS SHORTER!!! 🤣🤣 So basically the only way you’re using this outdoors is if you have a router sitting in a window within 10 feet of the camera!",1,1,2020-3-21,1,2,0
"Update on more problems, I have a hard wired camera  and does not require a battery but now the camera is asking for me to charge the battery when there is no battery to charge.

"Have Blink cameras and was looking to replace with a higher resolution and better night vision camera.  The Ring Stick Up (3rd  generation) is better than Blink in both resolution, field of view (wider angle) and night vision but is inferior to Blink in all other categories, including connectivity, response time, and motion zone setting. In addition, the mount that comes with the camera has extremely limited movement/positioning, which limits the ability to focus the camera view on the desired area.  Also,  recording length is not adjustable.  I thought the Stick Up Cam features and functionality (particularly the 3rd generation) would be similar to the Ring doorbell cam, with customizable motion zones, etc., but unfortunately that is not the case. Returning the stick up cam and will stay with the Blink XT2 for now.",2,1,2020-1-20,1,1,0
"I started with Ring 2 years ago... I started with a Blink xt system which i still use .,When i got the Spotlight cams i loved the light feature and  two-way talk and siren feature being that my street had alot of car break ins.. fast forward to buying The new stick up cam..  camera works very well and has two way talk .. Ring also added 2 new features which one is  recording snap shots every 3 to 30 mins you get to choose the interval.. this is almost like 24 hr recording..  2nd you can set the modes.. say if your at home you can hit the home bottom and it will turn off certain cameras you choose.. like say the back yard if your are out there.. Now the best Part of Ring is the Uncanny customer service I received from Jason on 4/1/20..  He walked me threw everything on my system and got it up to running very fast and now everything is great again..  I would buy more of these cameras  in the future to get more areas covered  but the best thing about Ring over its competition is customer service..  bar none ! Thank you Jason for outstanding customer service. !",5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"After purchasing a ring doorbell 2, and loving it, I decided to add a stick up cam for the house. The doorbell cam is very reliable, good quality image, live view loads fast, and battery life is great. This stick up cam is downright terrible. I don't say this lightly. I have had some way cheaper home camera products that performed far better. I never write reviews like this but I'm so surprised by how poorly this works that I just had too. For starters, it only connects to wifi successfully less than 10% of the time. I have it right next to the router and it still almost never works. I've tried disconnecting other devices to ensure there's proper bandwidth... no dice. I tried connecting my old cheap security cam from best buy I got 4 years ago....instantly connected. The live view does not work at all on this (even with the few times it has successfully connected). Wondering if I got a lemon. Will be returning the product sadly.",2,1,2020-2-7,1,2,0
"This is an updated review after an issue with this wireless camera requiring a battery was fully relinquished (it was a firmware update that involved in-depth diagnoses and was eventually pushed out).  The Ring representative took lots of time for me, was very understanding and professional.  I am heavily invested in the Ring ecosystem, and while some firmware issues may occasionally be works in progress (don't underestimate the complexity of such systems!), and that wifi connectivity issues not necessarily under Ring's control can cause issues, the Ring team is indeed receptive and working on the things that are under their control.  Based on my experiences and knowing that things take time to make right, I WOULD recommend Ring system components.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,1,0
"Update: My camera was only doing 20 second snips. I actually talked to an Amazon tech to ask for help. He spent a good amount of time, but ended by telling me 20 seconds was normal! This morning the app informed me I had a plug in model and did I want to activate the better video options available for the plug in model. It prompted me to put the camera in start up mode (pushed button inside battery compartment). I went thru the guided set up, including much more detailed motion zones. Camera also lengthened video from 20 seconds to a full minute!!! Yay!!!😀😀😀I am very pleased with this cameras performance overall. I have 2 other Ring cameras and they work well together. I have mine all linked for extra security. My only disappointments was long lag times to access LIVE video sometimes. Rapid Ring app seems to have solved this problem. It is a very basic app that you can use as a supplement to the original app. It has only 2 functions live video access FAST and it can send notifications. You will probably want to disable the notification feature as they are basic and cannot compare to the original app custom notifications. You must disable the notification in the Rapid Ring app or it will disable your custom notification in the original app. Rapid Ring is available for Fire tablet too 😂!!! Bigger Pic and no drain on my phone battery!!!",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,1
We already use a ring front door camera. It’s worked so well and it’s easier just to stick to the same brand for home security. We wanted a camera that could be used inside or out since on limited budget. This does the job.If my kids are outside in our backyard I just place it on a chair or picnic table. It easily covers the width of our yard which isn’t that small. It comes in handy for “crowd control.” What I mean is when their friends from the neighborhood come over to play I just friendly remind all the kids that the camera eye sees all. I haven’t had to use any recordings to resolve any issues and hope to never have too.,5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

"These are really just terrible. I bought 2 of them(one wired, one wireless) and they're useless. First, the app crashes ALL the time, I've never seen an app this bad. For security purposes, when you get a motion notification you need to be able to connect to the camera and investigate. Yet when you open the app it crashes literally 50% of the time so you miss the event. Ok, but at least it records the event, right? No, what they don't tell you up front is that the camera only records for like 20-30 seconds after motion is detected, even if the motion is still happening. So it'll record the potential intruder approaching, but then it stops recording before they actually do anything. Completely useless, especially because even the corded version doesn't record long either, so battery life is no excuse for this limitation. I assume it's so they can save costs on storing videos on their servers?But wait, there's more. You get a free trial where the recorded videos are saved on their servers so you can access them. When this trial expires the cameras no longer record videos unless you buy a subscription which is cheap, but even without the subscription you can still get motion alerts and connect to your cameras and see a live picture of what's going on(if the app doesn't crash, which it will). The kicker here is that as soon as my free trial expired, I could no longer to connect to live view either. Every time I try, it tries to load for a second then says ""Live View Ended"". Once in a while it actually connects. And it's not a wifi signal issue either, the device says the wifi strength is plenty strong, and this only became an issue directly after my free trial expired, so just seems like an attempt to get people to purchase the subscription by making the product totally unusable without it.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

Even when it looks completely dark outside the image is daylight bright and in color; most of the time the infrared isn’t even on. When the infrared turns on, it captures incredible, identifying detail on whomever is walking by.That being said, it gets three stars because of the WiFi. Only having a 2.4ghz radio is a clear problem in a dense, urban, apartment setting. That band is essentially useless nowadays.

I bought this camera to catch the person stealing from my garage. Well it took bout 2 months but yesterday 1-17-2020 the 10 year old from two houses down got caught by my ring camera. I took the footage to police and his family posted on ring area alerts. I would recommend these to anyone needing a way to keep tabs on area. It also works amazingly as a baby monitor.  Be sure to change the passwords and then remember the alerts may be annoying but it only took that one time to catch the kid.,5,1,2020-1-17,1,2,0

"This product worked well for 2  months, but then suddenly it went haywire. I have two cameras, each with a different alert sound. Almost every  morning at precisely 8:05 a.m. the Ring app on my cell phone blurts out a cacophony of alert sounds in rapid succession. Between 15 and 50 alerts from both cameras sound off over the span of 20-60 seconds. All without any motion. At first I thought it had to do with my phone's Do Not Disturb featured, which silences notifications overnight. But if that was the case, my app would have a corresponding video for every chime occurrence, but there are no videos. I made Ring an exception to my Do Not Disturb list so that notifications would come in while I slept, but that did not solve the problem. I get zero notifications overnight, but a concert every morning still.I contacted Support and they had no answers. They recommended snoozing Ring overnight. Well, that kinda defeats the purpose. If someone's at my door at 2 a.m. I kinda want a video recording.",2,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0

I liked the size of this camera and the ease of use and setup.  It is on the larger side as it is about the size of a soup can.The biggest complaint I have is that you cannot deactivate the blue indicator light on the device when it detects motion or when you are viewing the live view.  Now others have said to just put a piece of black electrical tap on it but who really wants to buy a camera that you have to modify right out of the box.  This could easily be done in the software to enable or disable that indicator led, it is so bright others notice the camera and it is distracting when you are outside in the dark, all you see is this bright blue led.",1,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0

"These are no more expensive than cameras without sirens, voice and tight integration. The only way to save video is thru the subscription but for $10 (3+ cams) it includes a lot of other valuable addons. The battery lasts weeks or longer. I didn’t feel the solar panel was necessary; I will recharge the pack once a month or so. If you really need wireless, by the time you find another solar / battery cam that actually works and you set up storage, etc, you will have spent more than this. If this is for your parents, no question, it’s the best for normal users. Also, use the ring.com store if you’re a veteran, student or teacher for 20% off.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,1,0
"So I have had the ring doorbell for sometime now and love it. It’s not hardwired so I do have to recharge it every now and then but it will go a month or two before it needs to be charged again. I decided I wanted a camera in my backyard and I searched for something that could be used that doesn’t have to be hard wired as well. So of course I turned to Ring again since the doorbell is so amazing. I wanted to use only one app system too so that’s another reason why I got the ring stick up cam so everything is under the same app and easy to use. One thing I would HIGHLY recommend if you are not hard wiring this product to get the solar charger for this. I did not and I wish I did. I bought the camera first just to see how long one battery charge would last. It was only a week IF that. And I have it on the lowest alert possible so it doesn’t go off all day long. The set up and the placement is very simply straight forward and easy. The battery though takes HOURS almost a whole day to charge! So, that led me to buying another battery. So when one is in there is another fully charged on deck to use when needed which has been once a week. It’s easy to change them out but it’s really annoying that I have to do often. I wish I would have gotten the solar charger because it was only 20$ more than the extra battery. Overall I would still buy this product again knowing what I do now but id get the solar charger.

Another is no custom motion zones like on the floodlight cam.

Other than this it is great I highly recommend they solar panel, I have had this installed a week now and have never had battery issues even with the motion being set off all the time.

"Amazed at the quality of the image and sound feedback on this. I bought 2 of them. Definitely purchase the wifi extender though. One of the cameras has a struggle with wifi range sometimes but it's having to go through brick. That cam is actually the closest in range to our wifi. There's no way to remove blockages or move it closer either but I haven't had many signal drops on it. The one feature I wish it did have is fish eye view or more of a wider view to cover a bigger area. The sirens on these are not very loud, so don't expect that to really alert the neighborhood or draw attention to suspected creepers on your property. These cams link to a ring doorbell, which is pretty cool. So when someone drives up in the driveway, the ring door bell starts recording before they walk up. You can unlink the devices though. The battery life is what I expect them to be. I recharge these batteries once every 2 weeks probably can go 3 weeks. And that's with the dogs playing outside setting them off every 30 seconds sometimes. lol. You just have to work with the motion detection to custom it to your household activity level. The motion detection is not a far distance, about 30 feet. No big storms lately, so no idea how well it hold up. But they have experienced a few downpours. I was surprised at the viewing of night vision. Maybe it's because our outdoor light stays on in the driveway, but it's brighter than the Ring 2 doorbell.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0

I have 3 of these cameras, 1 at my front door, 1 at my side door and 1 at the garage. I have deliveries at least 3-4 times per week and they rarely capture the footage. I had a tv delivered today to my garage and the box was completely torn and it looked like the delivery driver just threw the box it my driveway.

I want to activate them when I leave, but as far as I can tell the only way to do that is to go in to each camera and activate it individually.  To make matters worse, one of them activates when I tell it.  The other requires me to set up the zones and sensitivity EVERY TIME, regardless of how many times I have hit ""Save"".  I wanted more of these, but this is such a hassle.  There doesn't seem to be a command, verbal or online where I can say ""activate all cameras"".

First, if they don't include a masonry bit, at least state in instructions you need a 1/4"" bit.

I’d give this a ZERO if I could. ALL FIVE purchased have to go back. NONE would connect to my ATT UVERSE WIFI. The device is LESS than 50 ft from my centralized router and the RING Customer Service says the cams have to be within FIFTEEN FT of my router. Who the heck is able to have ALL cams within 15 feet? All have to be returned for a refund. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN,1,1,2019-12-21,1,2,0
"I have some other Ring cameras and alarm and they were all super easy to install and set up. I bought two stick up cameras to add to my system.  I was a little surprised to find out that the stick up (wired) model could still fit a battery, despite no battery included in the package. The camera worked for a little over an hour, when I got a notification saying that the battery was critically low. This would be an ok notification if I had a battery, but I don’t! I had the same issue with the other camera, it worked for less than 2 minutes before it started saying that the battery was critically low and shutting off. I am really disappointed. I tried resetting and adding them again to my account multiple times to no avail. I found out online that it could be a firmware issue. There is no way to control what firmware you have on your camera unfortunately. I do not recommend this model at this point. Go for the cheaper and less complicated indoor cameras.",1,1,2020-5-30,1,0,1
I have other Ring products and I'm happy with them so far.  I got this one instead of the Ring spotlight cam because I didn't want to light up my neighbors house when it detected motion.It was missing some screws and the wall anchors and the hand tool they normally come with.  For me this was not a major issue since my two spotlight cams came with extra.  I also got the solar panel for it and it works like a champ.,3,1,2020-4-22,1,1,1
"Very ticked off at Ring this camera has no ""Motions Zones"" so you cannot limit its field of detection like on your driveway so it does not catch all the cars and people walking by on the sidewalk.  Second it does not have the ""Rotate Video"" ability other cameras have so if you mount it on the eves upside down you need to order another part mount that allows you to turn the camera right side up.  On other cameras you can just use the ""Rotate Video"" function in the app.  Now I have to return this thing and waste a bunch of time what a joke.  This ""New"" product is terrible as it has less functionality than the old ones.",1,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"2020-07 Update: Motion area settings finally updated to the same control as the other cameras, now I am happy. Thanks for finally doing this Ring.  Now the Video doorbells need a control to keep the night vision (infrared lights) off like the stickup cam does.Generation 3 camera should have the same if not better motion zone settings than previous generations and other/older Ring cameras.  Three partial zones that can only be turned on or off is so below what I believe Ring standards should be.  I don't understand why this camera was released with anything less.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,1

"I've never considered myself to be the ideal customer for a security camera since I live in a small studio apartment in a big complex. However, after a few instances of maintenance coming by without giving me a heads up (and me worrying about my cat), I decided to take the leap and buy a Ring Stick-Up Cam, and I couldn't be happier! It did take a little bit of trial and error as far as setting up the privacy zones and the motion settings, but it's perfect now and truly only notifies me when someone's at my door - I've only experienced my cat setting it off once, so I'm happy!",5,1,2019-11-20,1,1,0
"I'm on my fourth of these cameras for use around my home. I've been able to cover all my major access points and a few blind spots around the property. I'd read mixed results on the battery life of this model. My results have been highly dependent on the placement. Those with less traffic like the garage and basement entries have lasted 3+ months on a single charge. Having dogs that like to spend time on the deck, it lasts about 2 months on a charge. The app makes it very easy to monitor these levels and the reminders help plan when it needs a charge. I found it best to buy an extra battery and keep it charged as it then just requires a swap out and not two trips up the ladder. The wi-fi connection to the cameras seems to improve the longer it is installed (I assume it has to do with finding the best connection point) and regularly connects to the same access point. The speed to access is my only complaint as it can sometimes take a while to access the camera or a stored video once you get a motion notification. I'm sure this conserves battery life but when trying to see if I need to run to answer the door or if it is just someone dropping off a package the delay can get frustrating. Looking forward to trying the capture function in the latest firmware/software update.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
"The product itself is very cool - pretty easy to install and has cool features and picture quality.Unfortunately, in my home which is brick, the cams fall off the WiFi network (which uses a high-end mesh router), and when that happens the purpose of the product is defeated. When the network is not connected, you cannot access the live camera view and the motion detection is not reporting back to my phone. Even though the cams are fully powered and will sometimes later get re-connected, any events that took place during the network disconnect will not get reported later when the device is back online... I've tested by walking through the middle of the view.",2,1,2020-8-20,1,1,0
"I purchased the Ring stick-up camera to place outside of my garage to get a view of my driveway and side yard.  I already have the Ring doorbell Camera (v2), floodlight cam for the backyard and the Ring Alarm System.  This was the last pc. Setup was a breeze like their other products. I had a small problem with motion detection after setup - I toggled motion detection on/off a few times and fixed the issue.  Also, if you call their customer service, they are great and I've called them twice on Sundays and got someone on the phone right away.  I went with the wireless battery cam and I also have the battery powered doorbell. Word to the wise, buy an extra battery to have charged and ready for a quick swap when needed so you don't go unprotected. The clarity is great also! This totally destroys the Netgear Arlo system I was using previously. You can't go wrong with Ring!",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"Whyyyyyyyyy does the stick up camera not allow you to flip your video or set motion boxes, but the cheaper plug in cameras do?!?

"We tried several other less expensive products and the old saying of ""you get what you pay for"" seems true with wireless security cameras.  We ended up returning the other brands we tried due to reliability issues.  After installing the first ring with trouble free performance, we purchased three more and they all continue to work flawless.  3 are powered by 110v to an outlet and 1 is battery powered since we didn't have an outlet nearby.  The battery is right at 50% after two months of use, so we will charge it with the included charger sometime in the next month.  Definitely recommend so far.  We also added the $10/month plan that gets all video recording from all devices, plus gives extended protection with a free replacement if a camera should fail permanently.",5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
Pros: easy to install But...!!BIG CON: cannot control length of recording!! Even when it’s plugged-in and not run on battery alone. Essentially stops recording even when motion activity is ongoing.

"I brought the ring out door camera about 3 months ago. At first it was okay. First thing I noticed it would not record all of the motion for some reason. Second thing I noticed was about a month ago it started to go in and out sometime it would show picture sometimes it wouldn't, now about a week ago it went from sometimes to nothing. I cant connect to it after it being in the same spot for 2 months, and if it does connect it shows a bunch of lines and that's it. I contacted Amazon about this problem and they were no help at all all they would say was, it was older then 3 months by a couple days and they can't refund nor replace camera. All I got was they would have someone from the tech team contact me and thats been days ago. Havent heard nothing. Very upset about this. I would not buy im sure there are better options out there. Look elsewhere. I would have ablot more to say if it didn't go the way it did with Amazon. They own the company ring lol and yet they still can't do anything for me. I have been a amazon customer for years and prime as well. And this it how they treat you. What a joke!!!!!!!!!",1,1,2020-5-29,1,1,0
"I bought these cameras to put on the front porch and lanai out back. Setup was simple, but there was an issue with a weak wireless signal for the lanai camera. I ended up having to get a range extender to fix that, but then found this kit isn't like what Ring normally gives you. For example, the security screws are a philips screw instead of the usual ring star screw and not all the mounting hardware is included in these. Theres no ring screw driver,drill bit, or even the screws to affix the power adapter to the wall. I called Ring and they said thats what is included and tried to figure out the right mounting hardware for outdoor power brick. Without that, anyone can pull power from your camera. Ring tried to find the part and is hopefully sending them to me. These cameras are essentially the 2nd gen battery camera with a power cable. However, unlike the 2nd gen, there's no way to secure the barrel tip cable to them like the old 2nd gen battery. The Pro is the outdoor power cable combined with the plug makes a total length of 32 feet you can run your camera from and I used every inch of it on my front porch. Its a good value camera and works great. I appreciate the added advanced motion zones, but if i did it over, I would probably go with either the Ring Elite or Spotlight wired camera over these for outdoor use.",4,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"Thought we would save money and get this instead of the wired Ring floodlight camera. We couldn't use it where we wanted it. On same wall as Ring wifi extender, and still has a low wifi signal. Has a small non adjustable motion detection area. Battery takes a while to charge. Night vision is good, but the motion area is half what it sees. We bought another floodlight camera, where we wanted this one placed, has a wired light so no battery charging and motion area way larger. This  little battery camera can be out anywhere, so that is a plus. If you had a small area, with good wifi signal, might be okay. We have no problem with WiFi on the floodlight camera, even though in same area. This tiny camera is easy to move, so might be better inside. Images glitch and freeze but think that is wifi signal issue.",3,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"I got the stick up outdoor plug-in version with the intent that it will be plugged into my UPS backup.  Interestingly, the unit itself is the same as the battery operated version.  Both priced the same. Noting the difference is one gets a battery only, and the other the 120v outlet plug only.  Just to be fully covered, I bought the battery here as well afterwards.Its great that the battery charges in the unit when plugged it and keeps it on standby at 100%.  No where does it mention this nor has anyone commented about this.  But you heard it from me...IT DOES.  Its awesome.  The app heath mode even shows the Power Source (outlet) and battery level %...the charging icon shows up in the corner if charging.  Occasionally, I'll unplug it from the UPS outlet to keep the battery lifecycle in check (never good to keep rechargeable batteries (NiCd, NiMH, LiIon)  in standby/trickle mode long term).",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"The first 30 days (refund period) the camera seemed to work great! Once that period was up, we have had nothing but issues. For one, maybe on my end, you HAVE to pay the subscription fee if you are unable to view a notification at the time it notifies. Which comes to another issue, maybe 50% of the time at best, will the camera actually connect and allow live viewing. For my wife, it is even less likely that it will connect for live viewing. And the battery life is horrendously short. It lasted about the first month before needing recharged, but in the roughly 1.5 months we've had it, its gone through the battery almost 3 times. This is simply on my front door with an average of maybe 3-5 times a day it should go off. We got these to replace our Arlo cameras that were 3 years old and starting to have issues. Unfortunately, I am beyond the refund period so I am not only out the cost of the camera, but also the $30 annual subscription fee that I will not be using. Maybe I am one that had a bad experience, but for me, this is definitely not the answer.",2,1,2020-8-6,1,1,0

If there are no outside lights to assist you might be better off with the LED spot, though I've read that there are issues with those.Not having an end without the plug attached is borderline design malpractice (aka: no one tested the damn thing).  You need to drill a 1"" hole through the wall in order to fish the line through.  and given that many exterior installations would be on block, that's difficult for a carpenter/handiman and nearly impossible for the average homeowner.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0

Additionally, the new models only come in white. I wish Ring would have kept the original mounting design and offer black (color) as an option.  Overall functionality, the cameras work pretty well, although they do miss catching motion at times.  The app works well.  Note: two cameras totally stopped working (after putting in fully charged batteries, they became completely worthless) because the battery levels got to low!

"I was really disappointed at the fact that you cannot adjust your motion zones, there's only a single option and divides the screen into 3 sections and you can on or off either or all, you cannot select from where to where as other ring cameras allow to do so. Also even with a paid subcription you don't have the option to ""people only"" so if you have cats/dogs in your yard you will get constant notifications. It covers a much smaller range as the spotlight cam, I would say 1/2 of the space as the spotlight does. The siren is not as loud as other models of ring cameras, I would say is pretty much useless as is SO quiet which defeats the whole point of being a siren.

"Had problems right out of box. During setup could not get a live view from camera. Called customer support and after multiple resets got it to work. However after several days of use and testing discovered the motion sensing was very intermittent and we were not getting notifications for most occurrences (people coming and going to door). Called customer support again and was given a sure fix that of course did nothing to fix problem. On a whim I decided to try the camera with the Motion Verification setting in the off position(found in the app under motion settings-supposed to reduce false positive notifications). With this function off the camera started working and started picking up motion in the zones. I then called customer service to discuss the ramifications of using the camera with this setting in the off position. Talked to 3 different CS agents in tech support and not one had a clue what Motion Verification even was. One had me send him a screenshot of where it was on app. Another said if I turned it off, the camera would never pick up motion. Have to say Ring customer support  is very very poor- at least at the1st level. They do answer the phone quickly but they are of very little help and are very UN-knowledgeable of their product.

Only positive thing I can say about this generation camera is the video quality is great, and the sound quality is great.

After following steps with ring customer service, its constantly the same issue. Never able to connect to live view. as far as the motion detection? its non existent. It doesn't allow you to set up the motion areas you want, and not to mention when the camera says the motion detection is on...

After playing with the other 3 that I also purchased and getting frustrated and walking away they 1 by 1 started working without me even touching them. Once I had them all working installing them was easy. I then switched to using the solar panels and all 4 cameras died over night. I’ll try moving the panels into more direct sunlight and hope that helps. In the mean time I’m trying to switch the power mode back to battery and again running into so many complications.  Why wouldn’t these switch to battery mode on their own?  Even though I charged the battery over night, ran the cameras on solar panels until they died in one night, I still need to charge the battery before I can switch to battery mode.  I thought the batteries were supposed to last 3 months. What a pain these have become. I will say for the (very few) short hours these worked they were wonderful.*UPDATE*  An associate from Ring saw this review and set up an appointment to help figure out the issues.  From the phone call I learned my battery died quickly because I had it set to WIRE mode while plugged into the solar panel which is the incorrect setting, it should still be on battery mode.

"I just bought this new version (3) of the Ring stick up camera. The camera and all the features work fine but I couldn't give it 5 stars because of the new design of the AC plug. I want to use it outside which it is made for and with AC power. The issue is the design of the power cord. On one end of the wire is the plug which goes into the AC outlet which is understandably large. The new design on the other end is a right angle plug to go into the camera itself. the issue is that you have to make an extremely large hole in the wall to get the right angle plug through. My previous cameras have a straight plug so no large hole required. Called customer service about the issue and she said that most people use it in an apartment. Not sure what the difference is, if it is made to use outside then  you will sill have to go through the wall.

"I bought two of the stick up cams and installed them per the instructions where I deemed most effective.

And although the image quality and all other aspects are great for all these cameras, I am really upset that the stick up cams cannot invert the image. There is no option in the app for inverting for these on the stick up cams. So please beware if you were planning on installing such as I have. I found that you have to buy a separate mount to install it upright on a wall, which is not what I want.

Also to add insult to injury Ring block most Google Assistant commands.  They try to blame it on Google but that's a lie  NOT HAPPY RING.  Next house is Google all the way.,1,1,2020-5-14,1,0,1
"Everything is good with this camera except 2 things. First, I encounter an app glitch with all my Ring devices recently. Sound alert disappears, l spent hours with ring team and my phone carrier but still could not solve the problem. Secondly, the camera is NOT angle-adjustable, meaning it can only look straight ahead from the position you mount it. I mount it higher on my outside wall. for it to capture images lower down, I had to cut wood blocks at an angle before mounting the camera. How much easier would it be if ring just made the camera angle adjustable ? Other than that, I have always liked the make quality or ring items, and in fact have installed their doorbell, security system and cameras.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I reached out to customer service after my device crapped out after a month. The customer service of Ring is complete garbage. My camera will not detect motion or let me view live video, however, the customer service agent tried to tell me that it was the app causing the issue, not my camera. However, this was impacting my phone, iPad, and computer were all unable to view live footage and the camera would not light up when motion was detected. Spent an hour on the phone with customer service (to get nowhere) then I finally asked for a replacement camera. Then while she was placing the order, unannounced to me, I get a charge on my credit card for Ring, authorizing my card without my permission. I would not have had a problem with them authorizing for collateral, but you need to ask first. Then, after that, I get an email and the agent put the wrong address so who knows if my replacement camera will ever make it to me. What a damn joke of a company. Amazon should be disappointed.Update 05/05/2020: still horrible! I got an email today from ring saying my device had shipped. I had called back and they said they had updated my address. When I finally got the email saying my device had shipped, I checked tracking. Looks like they shipped it over a week ago and forgot to tell me, but they still did not update my address. Time for another 1 hour phone call of disappointment. They should be really disappointed. Not up to Amazon standards, that is for sure.",1,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I knew going in that a paid subscription was required to record videos.  What I didn't know was that once motion is detected the response time is too slow to bring up a live view in a reasonable amount of time.  20-30 seconds most times and often it fails to bring up the live view at all.  So slow/no live view plus no video to review equals pretty useless.  We also have Arlo cameras which have a similar response time to live view, but the FREE videos are always recorded.Update: 2/19/2020",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I got this camera with ring solar panel, linked the device to my wired ring doorbell. Fully charged it before installing it and it hasn't been 30 days and the battery is completely dead, here I am charging the battery once again. What is the point of having a solar panel when it's completely useless, and by the way there's plenty of sun. The ring stick up cam is in the front of the house and sadly the linked events are worthless, my doorbell cam picks up everything perfectly and this camera thats right in front of the house picks up ghosts passing by or it doesn't even catch it at all, you see a passing unidentifiable myst. I was excited to get this cam because I really like my doorbell but it's all a joke. My doorbell picks up an event and the other one is super delayed where sometimes it shows nothing, but my doorbell does. I kinda don't know if I should just return it and go with a different company because what you pay for this cam it looks like theres better ones out there.",1,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
"I just received and installed my new 3rd generation stick up camera - and I LOVE it!  Incredibly easy to install in my living room and I am pleased with the range of field and image quality.  Planning to add another in my family room, then add 2 or 3 outside.",5,1,2019-10-25,1,3,0
"This item works fine! So, one might say what's your problem?The fact that the so-called Ring Protect Plan is NOT A WARRANTY as it may sound like! It is the operational management of this device. AND, after the ""introductory"" 30 day period, the unit is virtually useless unless you live your life with your telephone in your hand! After 30 days, there's FEE, a subscription that makes the item operational again. The fee is/was glossed over in the ""fine print""! They'll put the sales pitch n you: ""it's on'y $3 per month!"" OK Bunky, that's $36 per year IF THEY DON""T RAISE THE SUBSCRIPTION RATE!! Oh sure, Amazon offered a refund but who's going to fill in the holes in my house and paint the repairs?

"I can't see my driveway too well from the back door and this fixed that blind spot perfectly. Not a single negative comment. Easy to install, Easy software with people friendly tiles to help set up, snooze and view.  I have mammoth moths that like to hang around and they do set of the motion alert. When it storms and the leaves are flying everywhere, it will also trip the motion alert, but that is easy to fix with the snooze function till the storm passes.Long battery life. I have had it up for 3 weeks now and the battery is at 70%.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,1,0
"This is an updated review.  My first review was not good. I was very disappointed at how many steps it took to turn video recording on/off.  I was contacted by Ring support.  New features are being rolled out, and Support got the new features pushed to my account.  The Mode feature solves my issues making turning recording on/off a one-step process in the app now.  The video quality is really good.  There's no Alexa skill to voice control recording, at least not yet, which is why I couldn't give this a 5-star review.  But at this price point, it is a really good value.",4,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
"After an excellent experience with the Ring doorbell, this unit was a great disappointment.First of all the snapshot capture that works with my doorbell apparently isn't supported for this model.

"There is no option to set up Echo Show to view the camera automatically when motion is detected. This is a huge oversight.Additionally, there are often false positives when shadows from trees moves, and the motion zones distance cannot be adjusted. There are three large motion zones that can be turned on and off, which is practically useless. And sometimes it fails to pick up motion if it’s within a few minutes of previous motion.",1,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
Camera won’t work unless it’s 20 feet from your internet router.(WiFi) it’s really hard for the camera to detect motion effect even if you change the settings. Night vision sucks! Unless you have a light on near it. You can’t zoom nor move the camera side to side on your phone and the length of the view can’t be widen to cover more ground. Really disappointed on this one I think I will stick to my ring flood camera instead is way better!,3,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0
"I feel like I'm about to be screwed.  Got the box 9/16, everything looked fine.  The install location is different than the delivery location so I decided to open the box before I got to the location, check the battery and maybe do a test set-up (9/17/2020).  I'd previously read either in the product information or in an 'Answer' given by a Ring rep on Amazon that batteries are usually at least 70% charged upon arrival.  I plugged it in.  15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes.  I unplugged it from the computer and  plugged it in to a wall thinking maybe it would charge better.  60 minutes, 90 minutes and on and on.  So I didn't go that day.  Left it on the charger overnight.  The green light was on the next morning so I unplugged it, got ready to leave.  Before I left, I popped the battery in per instructions and Alexis or whoever's voice that is, lets me know that my battery should be fully charged before set-up.  HUH?  I just took it off the charger and hour or so ago.I pop the battery out, put it on the charger and sure enough the green light is gone?  Seriously, its been an hour since it was fully charged and it wasn't in the camera during that hour.  I wait for it to fully charge again, forgo the test setup and go to the location.  I sit in the car and start the set-up again.  Yep - BATTERY SHOULD BE FULLY CHARGED BEFORE SET-UP, its been30 minutes!!!  LOL.  I just continue with the set-up to make sure the wi-fi & everything works.  For over 20 minutes it said to wait up to 5 minutes for updates.  I finally closed & reopened the app and after a total of 30+ minutes it connected.",2,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
Not sure why people have all the negative reviews?  We have several Ring devices now and they all set up easily and work as advertised.  The only negative I have is the batteries take about 9 hrs to get a full charge thus 4 stars and not 5.  Plan on getting the double battery charger in the future and maybe an extra battery.  Sure beats the old antiquated wired systems in the past.,4,1,2019-11-9,1,2,1
"The two-way talk feature is useless. I can never hear the other person nor is it clear enough to hold a small conversation. The siren works and it's loud. The battery doesn't last as long as it states. I've had to recharge it multiple times within a one month's timeframe. Customer service wasn't that helpful when the app logged me out and I tried login back in. It took over 30 minutes after multiple attempts of resetting my password. The first customer service lady cut me off as I tried to explain to her the issue and then hung up on me when I got loud and told her to stop cutting me off. I had to call back and wait over 10 minutes for another representative. Carla was patient and helpful. She couldn't figure out how to resolve the issue and just as she was going to escalate the issue, it began to work. I was weary about this product and can't say that I'm confident moving forward.",3,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"We have 6 other Ring devices that are all working fine. This makes the third Ring camera that we have received recently that fails to detect motion. All the settings are configured for motion detection and notification. Walking in front of the camera waving hands does not produce an alert. Even picking up the camera and moving it around produces no motion alert.It’s interesting that ring has also cut corners with the camera itself. The case feels much cheaper with worse fit and finish when compared to earlier examples of this version of the camera. The mount is also cheaper and less effective, not nearly as stable as the old version. The old version of the mount is available, it runs about $20. Ring even stopped including a screwdriver.",1,1,2020-8-18,1,1,0
"I set mine up outdoors and it was a relatively easy process. The software was very helpful in the setup process and is easy enough to use when checking alerts, adjusting setting, etc.  Customer service is superior. I had an issue with wifi reception which they resolved. quickly. It required additional hardware which is why I rated the wifi a 3. Everything has been working really great. The only con I have is with the motion detection. It is very good with a very wide angle. However, there is no way to adjust the vertical distance. I have my camera pointed down as low as it will go but it still detects out across the street. As I result I get a lot of street traffic. Looking at it another way, too much is better than not enough.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"All of my other Ring cameras and doorbell cam have snapshot capture as a video option ... and a couple times I’ve seen some things of interest in the snapshots that didn’t trip major motion recording. On these newest stick up cameras, Ring has ruled out snapshot capture. Representatives say this was done out of fear that anybody who uses the camera without a solar charger or other external power might run down the battery too fast. But the camera already recognizes when it has external power rather than just a battery, so why not have the software allow snapshot capture when there is an external power source (either solar or plug in)? This changes the value of the camera from 5 to 4 stars for me.",3,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"The camera works as advertised.  I had to replace a 1st gen stickup camera w/solar panel for this one. The battery in the older went bad after one year and I couldn't find a replacement anywhere on the internet. The bracket that came with the camera didn't work for me, because I needed the camera pointing down more than the included bracket would allow.  I had to buy a second bracket ( Ring Stick Up Wall Bracket-X002DVAFDR white) to finish my installation. The battery in the new gen. camera is alot earier to get to and is available.My recommendation would be to include one of these brackets even if there was a slight increase in price.",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"Took advantage of a Black Friday sale on Amazon and picked up this Ring Stick Up Cam.  I have used it in the back yard to get a full view of our entire yard from the porch.  Recently moved it to the side of the house, plugged into a AC outlet, so I can monitor the feral cats we are feeding, catching, and fixing and finding homes for.  Have also seen racoons, opossums, and crows out there.  Works great day and night and I can always check in using the Ring app on my phone.  The cats come by and let me know its time to eat and I get alerts on my phone from the motion sensor.  I may buy another one so I can have the full outside of our house monitored.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"Update: at first around setting up ring is excellent. It has an option where you can widen the area coverage by just sliding the sliders. (Not the sensitivity as the customer services was try to impose) and now that feature is GONE. I adjusted the position of my camera and if ofcourse i have to adjust the coverage as well. And its not there. I called ring, and the customer service doesnt even know what happened to that feature and if it was taken out. And we cannot return it because the allowed return time is expired. Why would they market something and then take out a feature that makes it good. Its sucks and until now I did not get any explanation on what happened",3,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0

Works..  with my firestick, my echo dot notifies me if there is motion, and I can ask alexa on my Kindle fire to show me the front door.  They all work well... as well as on my Android Phone.

"The camera was easy to install and set up. I bought the plug-in version, and there is a lot of power cable included. The only thing I wasn’t too happy with is the features available. Unlike my ring doorbell I can’t set motion zones only motion sensitivity. I know that is just a firmware issue, but I wish the settings were universal across all of their products.It does capture motion very well and the picture is great. It is much more sensitive than my ring doorbell when it comes to detecting motion. I plan to buy a couple more soon.",5,1,2020-3-17,1,1,0
"Though I am not worried about intruders, we will surely see them coming with these clear cut cams. If you order the mounts, that will help a lot by way of positioning.

The signal is strong, the speaker is clear and the siren feature, though a little low, let anyone know these trouble afoot.But the views on can have along with natures sounds right at your fingertips it you just cant get out side is impressive.

"Ring Stickup Cam (Battery) with Solar Panel.---- Likes When the cam is working it works great.--- Dislikes I set the cam up on Dec 21 2019 for the first time. Next day could not access Cam. Cam had switch to power outlet from battery and no way to change it back to battery in the app. So had to take the Cam down a reset the Cam in the setup. in 5 day I have had to reset the 3 times because of this. This morning day 6 same thing, Cam has switch to outlet at night time cant access Cam. Cam not working again going to have to take it down and reset the Cam for the 4th time in 6 days. Dec 27 2019. If the cam is this much trouble I would not Buy it until ring fixes the problem. I have tried to contact ring on there web page thru there chat and did not get a answer to my problem and the problem is not my WIFI. Readings thru the cam Download 38 mbs--- Upload 14 mbs ----Ping 76 Good luck if you order this with the solar panel. Going to unhook the Solar Panel and see if I have the same problem.Ok it has been 3 days with camera on battery and solar panel unplugged. The camera has worked great and has not went off line for 3 days. Working like it should work. So I am changing my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. I will give it a 5 star rating when Ring fixes the problem with the cam switching from battery to power outlet with the solar panel plugged in.

"I purchased around 375$ worth of ring products (3 cameras) and all the reviews look nice but whenever I fully charged the batteries (for both outdoor cams battery powered) the 3rd camera I have is the indoor only smaller version so it plugs in the wall for it’s power source. Well the other two with rechargeable batteries were both fully charged and died with in a week !!! When it’s said to last around 60 days and to 6 months when some statements even mention longer which doesn’t seem correct given mine under 7 days!If customers are spending good hard earned money on products that aren’t cheap you could at least throw in extra batteries  or solar panels for our safety and security and making us feel our money has been well spent and appreciated as a customer. I Plan on returning this product unless ring or some  kind of customer service member contacts me to either find a solution to the problem because it seems as if their (ring) products are the problem/issue. I’m considering a more reliable and traditional alarm system through the reputable brands we all see and hear of. Not a happy customer at all to have spent close to 400$ to have my batteries die in less than a week of operation. I feel as if you might as well be using cheap dollar store batteries. I have no problem changing my opinion, thoughts and reviews about ring products just wish they would better back their customers after they committed to their products. You can contact me through phone or email",1,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0

"Great camera. I bought this one for the garage and it’s perfect. Be careful not to get too much of the wall directly next to the video tho, because the night vision will focus on that and you won’t be able to see anything else. Otherwise perfect video quality and night vision is excellent. I have a mesh WiFi network and one of the access points is in the garage, so my video quality is excellent.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,1,0
The image quality is fantastic. Easy to install. Way better than the doorbell. The motion sensor is a little sensitive (picking up bugs but after that we decreased the sensitivity although I’d rather not). Our only complaint is that you have to get really close to it before the motion sensor is triggered. I would like for it to pick up movement a little farther away.,5,1,2020-7-13,1,1,0
"Totally worthless. Installed according to instructions, worked fine for about a week. Left on a 2 week trip. The night we left a thunderstorm came through. Power was out for a few seconds (my neighbor told me) and the battery powered camera was out. Can't reboot from away. Tried rebooting following every instruction offered once I got home, still didn't work. Doesn't do you much good when you're away if you can't reboot it.",1,1,2020-9-22,1,2,0
"Great unit clear pictures and since I bought the Professional Monitoring, I can review my activity at any time.  I had a real challenge in setting up the WiFi and had to buy the additional WiFi Ring retransmitter.  Even with that, I had to fiddle with the locations of camera and retransmitter but I now get reliable signal and great pictures.  It takes about 4-5 seconds for the real-time image to appear.  I also bought Echo's from Google and they work great.  I really like this product as it replaces my Blue Iris/FOSCAM setups so now Ring has the job of saving my video.  Highly recommended ... just be aware that you will also have to fiddle with the location if it is any distance away from your router.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
I had previously wrote a negative review regarding these cameras because they were not picking up motion well at all and they were not loading live view on my app. I found the issue was they were located too far from my WiFi network. I had them outside my house but the distance was too far for a good connection. I had to move them around and was finally able to get them positioned properly to work! Now they work great and I wouldn’t go back to any other camera. Ring is soooo easy to use and setup.,5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,1
"The camera picks up lot of background noise. The quality of picture is just okay, not great, and it misses out on a few minutes of motion recording at a time even when there is motion. Good basic camera for security but I dont think I will recommend it.Edited- I was contacted by Jason, a ring specialist within 24 hours of leaving the review. I already knew about their no nonsense customer care but this was unbelievable. I was super impressed and Jason, went in depth with me to troubleshoot the camera and when it failed, he sent me a replacement camera for free (I should also point out that I am a Ring Plus member so all my devices are 100% warranted anyway).

The audio and picture quality is perfect. I bought the separate subscription too (only $3 a month) and it helps give me the extra peace of mind while I’m away from home for long periods of time while at work. The motion detection notifies you immediately too! There’s zero delay in response time which is reassuring. It picks up sound from far away and with doors closed too. Ignore the bad reviews.

"Set up required me to purchase an update smart phone and go through two phone calls with tech support to somewhat solve the problem.  Many videos are black and other look like a blurry white flash.  I have been told that it might be my wifi connection/signal, but tested that and it meet the requirements.  I was also told it might be my firewall on my router, so I set ot at minimum, which makes me nervous, so I could get a signal and the results are mediocre.The idea is good and it is not that expensive, but it lacks real quality.  I picked up some trail cams [campark] and I am more impressed by the video I get from them.",3,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I’m a fan of Ring having had the doorbell for several years.  I needed a camera in the garage to have additional security and saw this Ring stick up camera.  Amazon was flawless in the delivery time as it arrived before our holiday.  While away, there were several times that I wanted to access the Live feed from the Ring camera to check on the garage.  It worked on some tries but not all and I thought perhaps it could be the WiFi Network.  I’ve returned home and now have repeatedly not been able to access the Live feed.  After reading other support messages and reviews, I’ve tried to troubleshoot the issue.  It’s definitely not the signal strength that others have experienced  (mine is RSSI -48).  I used my mobile phone to test the strength of the network next to the Ring and I’m getting north of 100M on download and over 20M upload.  Unfortunately without being able to access the Live feed, this camera isn’t useful and I will have to look into returning.  Could be a defective Ring camera but given that it’s $99 for the unit, too expensive to try another one and run into same experience.",2,1,2019-12-4,1,1,1
"This camera was an addition to our ring doorbell (which I love and works perfect). This, not so much. I have a blind spot with the ring doorbell so I purchased this and placed it a few feet from the doorbell. The wifi pickup shows a great reception so I installed it. One hour later I could not connect to live feed. The reception slowly trailed off and the camera would not connect to my iPhone. I took it down and reconfigured it to improve wifi reception. Placed it indoors to monitor its performance. Being 15 feet from wifi and the reception trails off to a point where I once again cannot connect live feed to my iPhone. I am not going to pay for monthly storage when I cannot even view live feed! I now have the camera facing a wall and it picks up who knows what and continually chief that there is movement, yet I cannot view live.  Ring suggests a wifi extender. If this cannot maintain reception from 15 feet away from a wifi source what good is an extender.",2,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
"I have several Ring products including the doorbell pro, the flood cam and the ring camera pro and have had no issues. I don't know if I got a defective product or the technology has changed but the Stick Up Camera is by far the worst camera I've owned! It has poor range signal, is constantly trying to connect to the network (despite being right next to the rooter) and drains the battery within 5 days. I tried to check on my animals while traveling and could not view the camera via the app the entire time we were gone. It's an absolute waste of money!! If you're looking for a good, stable camera that pans & tilts I highly recommend Foscam. Just ordered a new Foscam to replace my $100 ""shelf ornament"". The Stick Up Camera is not reliable!",2,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
I like that it's a simple cylinder type camera and prove to do the job. I wanted to hang it on the ceiling but couldn't because it did not come with bracket like the previous version. I thought you can change the camera view if the camera was hung upside down. I guess wrong. The bracket they offer was pricey. I ended up going to home depot to buy my a 3 dollar bracket and brought my camera there to find the right screw that fit the back of camera to mount on new bracket. Overall my setup came out nice.,4,1,2019-11-28,1,1,1
"Pros: Installation a breeze.Cons: doesn't work well in night. I pulled my car in the driveway and my car's headlight completely blinded the camera, so much that I couldn't see anything any longer; can't see the car, can't see anyone walking around, nothing.  What's worse is that it didn't record the car until it was in front of it with the lights on. So overall, a useless $100 device hanging on the outside wall at night.  So basically to beat this, one has to just flash light directly at the camera.",1,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0

I got a call from a great service rep at ring who explained from the way the IR sensors are angled, upside down would not work for the motion sensing. Also it will pop up and recommend the mount if you add to cart, but not if you click buy it now.

"I needed to keep an eye on a specific outdoor area at a second residence, and after seeing a family member’s satisfaction with a ring doorbell I decided to try a stick up cam.. For about five years, I have used Arlo cameras at other properties and have always been pretty happy with their ease-of-use and functionality. However the location am I needed to monitor in this case would make it inconvenient to have to change batteries as I do with the Arlo, and at this time hardwiring is not an option. The capacity to add a solar panel to keep the batteries charged is what attracted me to this product. After several days it has completely fulfilled my expectations. Camera is sending me alerts whenever workers are moving around on the property and also sent me some cool video of deer moving at the edge of the field of view, indicating good sensitivity across the monitored area. The app was also easy to set up on my iPhone and has been working very well.Location of the camera is about 60 or 70 feet across from a standard router supplied by the cable company that is located inside a small outbuilding on the property. I have been concerned about whether the camera would connect were intended to place it, but that worked just fine so the sensitivity seems to be pretty Location of the camera is about 60 or 70 feet across from a standard router supplied by the cable company that is located inside a small outbuilding on the property.

We originally sent back a message that we would not rate until we saw the cameras with our own eyes. When they were delivered we were at a funeral and I received the email and it said they were left in the hand of a resident --that was a false statement because no one else lives there and the two of us were gone so we were so afraid they would not be there once we returned home.

Easily 5 stars now!I love this device. It is so awesome to be able to see our home while we're away, and even have two way conversations with people! I definitely had problems getting the motion detection to work and send notifications to my phone, but I found that once I listened to the directions and fully charged it up, many of those problems went away.

I was concerned that even if we kept the back porch light on each night, the night vision would still not be sufficient enough to pick up on movement/a person (should someone attempt to hop our brick wall fence).I was pleasantly surprised to find that this camera’s capabilities were MORE than sufficient enough to do the job!",5,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0

With the Stickup Cam, you can only specify which 1/3 of the bottom 2/3 of the image you would like to monitor.  Great if the cam faces squarely the center of your yard and your yard is square.  If not, you will be either monitoring unwanted areas or not monitoring desired areas.  Ring needs to make the motion detection consistent among its products.  The Ring techs, did not even understand the problem, because they are not familiar with the rest of the product line.  Also, they claim that advanced motion detection uses more battery.

My only real disappointment with the camera is that it lacks a lot of the more advanced motion setting adjustments that are available on the other camera models. No matter what adjustments I make on this one, I find that it gets a lot of recordings of cars driving by down the street but often ignores me getting into my car right in front of it. Often times it only notices me as I am driving away. In 3 months I have gotten video of only one group of car checkers. Not sure if it is because it's less prevalent on our street or if the camera just doesn't pick them up.

The motion area simply divides the picture in three (imagine a half circle with three 40-degree angles meeting at the lens, like pizza slices) and you can decide which ones to turn on or off, which is limiting to begin with, but they also don’t work very well.",1,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0

Turns out they charged me 29.99 for it and reduced the price of the camera proportionally... which sound fine UNTIL I didn't receive the camera and had to reorder it.

I had to call in and fuss with customer service reps for an hour to convince them to refund for the whole bundled amount and convince them that the dot was SUPPOSED TO BE FREE!  Then when they finally refunded the price of the dot as well (which it was never my intention to buy) they told me I could keep the dot too.  Well, that seemed nice....

"We have been using a Ring Doorbell camera indoors for a few months now and were in need of a second camera for another room so we went with the Ring Stick Up Cam but I am really considering returning it. The motion sensor is very weak in comparison to the range you are able to get with the Doorbell version and I haven't found that the inclusion of the battery has given it extended battery life. I actually have to charge it more often than my Doorbell Cam. The semi-circle of motion it lets you select prohibits you from selecting an entire room top to bottom. I also don't know if maybe I received a defective model but the audio on the Stick Up Cam is barely usable at all? The audio works perfectly on my Doorbell Camera but on this model it's like audio can barely be listed as a feature.

To the “obstruction” argument, you can literally place the cameras on top of WiFi router and it still won’t give you a live view (it shows an “Activating Device” message forever until it gives you an error), so no, the problem is not the WiFi signal or the router (as I said, I have two other Ring devices connected to the same network and they perform fine). You’d think because these products belong to the same family they would have the same technology as the Door Bell and the Spotlight but I found out that’s not the case.

"I have had 2 Ring battery operated cameras installed on the exterior of my home since October 2019.  Thankfully I have not had any attempted break-ins at my home, as I only recently discovered the cameras will only record for 30 seconds from the moment it detects motion (20 seconds for cameras activated since March 2020).  And I only detected this when a contractor drive down my driveway, parked and walked to my front door.  The camera did its job and started recording when it detected the vehicle on the driveway, but by the time the contractor exited his vehicle, walked to and rang the door, and my wife walked to and opened the door, Ring had already been recording for 27 seconds.  So, imagine the same scenario and the person, after exchanging pleasentries assaults my wife; there would have no recording, as the 30 seconds of recording would have ended.I jumped on the internet to determine how I could lengthen the recording time, even at the expense of battery life.  After all, I had already bought an extra battery as the promoted battery life is a farce.  I discovered something called a ""Ring Community,"" where Ring consumers can ask product questions and Ring ""Community Managers"" allegedly act as a go-between between the customer and Ring developers.  I discovered that this issue was raised by a number of Ring customers starting back in July 2019, who have since become very unsatisfied Ring customers, and now some are ex-Ring customers.  Despite the Community Managers' standard line of, ""Rest assured that us moderators are reviewing every new post and reply as they come in,  ... and take your feedback seriously,"" they ABSOLUTELY DO NOT CARE about customer satisfaction.  If they did, they would listen and enable the customer to set the record time, certainly well beyond 30 seconds. Instead, Ring spent months modifying their software to do the exact opposite; now customers have the ability to REDUCE the record time.  What break-in occurs within a time period of LESS THAN 30 seconds?  Ring customers who have been victims of break-ins have been among those who have provided feedback to Ring within Ring's ""Ring Community,"" expressing the need for longer recording ability.  But all Ring has done is attempt to pacify with their same propaganda that they take customer feedback seriously, and have achieved nothing but infuriating those who have spent their money on a very inferior product.  Eleven (11) months have passed since the complaints about the inadequate recording time began within the ""Ring Community;"" and Ring has done nothing positive to improve their cameras.",1,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0

Won't even give me a proper error message as to what the problem is. My suggestion is if you like to waste your time and money AND raise your blood pressure this is the product for you.,1,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I purchased two cameras with solar panels as back-ups to a hard-wired security camera set that I also use. The microphone's on these cameras are incredibly sensitive.

Despite numerous adjustments this device it always misses the beginning of events and often misses complete events. Picture resolution varies greatly even when the light is decent.

"I miss a lot of activity. The motion detection simply doesn't pick up some events, or only records the first 30 seconds with no dedication to staying on for the entire event.

I’m in disbelief how poorly these things work.  I understand I got the battery powered one which is less capable of detecting motion.  The reality is it doesn’t detect motion at all.  Unless I physically move the camera I get no notifications of motion whatsoever.Edit,4,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0

Liked the older version even though it was more expensive but it came with all the mounting hardware as the new version does not and made setting up more time consuming. Solar panel connection on newer one is worse as it doesn’t have a way to secure connection to body of cam  like older version. Night vision on newer version is 100 times cleaner and clearer.

"Before buying this ring camera we owned 6 others that were either hardwired or had a plug near that they could be plugged directly into power -all we have been extremely happy with, however we had a location that we didn't want a cord and couldn't hardwire so decided to try this battery one.  My first concern was - how long would the battery last as we travel a lot and that's not something I could ask the person that stops by to do the mail to do for me.  We have been extremely impressed with it.  The quality is amazing and the battery - well, I charged to 100% on 12/23 as we were leaving for 2 weeks over the holidays and today 1/7 the camera is at 77% battery life.  The camera is in a spot that gets a lot of action when we are home and moderate when we are gone.

"Love my cameras , but if its windy out it seems to pick up Shadow movements from my tree off the drive. So I get a lot of battery usage from it going off. If I turn the setting down it misses movement it shouldn't so I just leave it on the more sensitive settings. All in all I'm happy with mine I just recommend getting the wired ones or get the solar chargers for the battery operated ones still need to order mine.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,1,0
"This camera is set outside on my back patio. It’s withstood some heavy Midwestern storms and wind thus far. Love the functions of being able to adjust the motion sensitivity as our back alleyway has high traffic. I primarily have it aiming on my deck so it does not pick up all the cars driving by, but can adjust it to pick them up. Easy to set up and user friendly.Recommend for extra peace of mind.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I hate putting a low rating on a ring product, as the product is great. I just got a replacement for another camera from ring, ordered a stick up and had similar problems. Went back on looked the 3 ring products I have had trouble with were purchased through amazon. The other ones that I love were purchased through Ring online. They are same price and good packaging. But poor performance from ones shipped from Amazon.",3,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"I like that it works very well and the response to motion detection is pretty good.  I got a protective case for it to keep elements from it  and was a cinch to mount. I'm using it in the front drive way of our home and we're very happy with it. I can monitor our driveway, the street and the mailbox. Its a great tool to keep an eye on the children on our block for there safety and security.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"This probably is a decent camera as long as you are willing to pay a monthly fee. It worked fine during the first month while all the features were free. After that the camera is useless unless you pay. It will send an alert but when you try to access it, following an alert, it will not connect to provide a live view. I consider this device a rip-off and will never buy from this company again. Other companies provide the same service for free after camera purchase (Wyze, Blink).",1,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0

Update 8/4/20: Ring contacted me and they are making an attempt to fix the situation. I'm getting a replacement so let's see how that goes and I will update my review again. This time the person I spoke with was much more helpful and interested in resolving the situation.Original review: Ring is having a known issue with these cameras yet letting us buy them just the same. They keep spinning on the connect option. Won't work. Save your money until they do updates to the firmware.,1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
All of our other Ring Cameras are 720P.  This is our first 1080 and I'm seriously considering replacing all my old ones.  Crystal clear during day and night.  Was able to mount to wall without purchasing the additional mounting kit.  Included mounting kit allowed me to mount approx 10' off ground and point down to the area I wanted to cover.,5,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
"I’m telling everyone this now because I wish I knew it before buying an attachment for this, IT COMES WITH A MOUNT! So many people in the questions and reviews said it didn’t come with a stand but it does! You just have to take it out of the box and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. Now that everyone knows the most important part, it’s an amazing product and my daughter loves it! She says she feels much more safe in her college apartment.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"These little cameras change everything! These work so well with out Alexa’s and Ring Alarm System. We have a few around our house as we do live kinda close to downtown. I love having the indoor camera start recording motion when I arm my system. Whenever motion is detected all the alexas announce it though the house.Now it’s not all been good, we have had a few issues with the cameras not connecting fast or starting feed fast but the signal strength is good.",4,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"just saw on the news that, the cams can be hacked and your home can be viewed by the hacker. I don't use mine indoors the are all outside of my home, so I am not worried, still satisfied, but I hope Ring will find a way to prevent the cameras from being hacked.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,2,0
"Update to my last review. Did a factory reset again and it hasn’t frozen in about a week. So I am assuming together with the reset and a software update may have resolved the issue. In spite of the early issues, I full recommend this camera. Convenience of being wire free while giving most of the features of a my Ring spotlight cam is great. I must mention also after my initial review RING reached out to me immediately via email to schedule a voice call to assist me. Excellent customer service.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
These are amazing. We have 4 and I love them. The only issue is when the motion is first detected. There’s always a weird flash of light at the beginning of the video. Sometimes even completely missing the motion. This specific camera is set up so we can see the cars that drive by since we live on a private circle and there shouldn’t be too much traffic.,4,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"I received a Ring doorbell for Christmas and liked it so well I added this for my basement garage. The picture is very clear, even at night. I sometimes use it just to make sure the garage door is closed before going to bed! Only complaint is that it has some difficulty maintaining a WiFi signal which drains the battery quickly.",4,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"The camera works great except the motion detection. For one, it only detects on the bottom half of the screen which makes it somewhat useless for detection my whole back yard. Also, sometimes I will walk through the yard and it detects nothing. I have it set to the highest sensitivity and frequent detection.",3,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"Buy with caution!!! I have called their customer support 4 times with this same issue. I’m mounting the camera on a wall in front of my home. The live feed connects fine at setup, but within a few hours drops connection even with the Chime Pro 20 feet away. I do have stucco walls. But wow, many homes do. Highly disappointed with this camera. No issues when installed indoors, as I have one mounted one inside in the hallway. Highly frustrating experience.😡",1,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"I probably won’t buy another one of these. The recording length (10 seconds) is way too short. Ring reasoning is to save battery life. I think they should leave this up to consumer. If I decide to have a longer record time that wear down the battery then that’s my choice.  Then I can either invest in another battery or adjust recording time. But to leave consumer with no choice is a bit unacceptable.Also, it sometimes doesn’t pickup motion in the range.",2,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0
"If I could rate technical support as well I would give them a negative 5. I purchased 3 ring products. The first 2 worked excellent. The stick up camera, however, never connected to my internet. After 15 attempts at troubleshooting on my own i contacted the help desk. Technical support wanted to argue it was an issue with my wireless connection. Why did my other 2 devices work perfectly if I have wireless problems? After an hour of wasted time on the phone with someone I could barely understand I will be returning my products and taking my business elsewhere.",1,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
Versatile cameras offering spy like features to catch your kid or spouse in the act.  Cover the red lights and you’re on your way to spy status. Hide them anywhere and watch as they come and go. You’ll soon realize how much your kids don’t listen to anything you say and how much time your spouse spends on the bathroom. Gotta love ring spy cams,5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
This “stick up” cam is nothing more than a waterproof version of the indoor cam. It’s not worth the $99.99 price tag. It doesn’t even come with a battery and the description does not indicate this. If I wanted a regular camera I would have bought 2 indoor cams for $120. It’s not worth the money.,3,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"I went back n forth. Heard the arlo cams were better. I have two of these and two indoor. Stick up cans constantly have to be reset, capture video for the set time, but miss anything completely after that. If someone walks up, hope they do it fast. Ive read to change this, move that. I've tried everything and my signal is good to their standards as well as my wifi. Seriously disappointed spending this much for hit or miss security. If you want security and safety, look elsewhere.",2,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0

"Bought several of these.  The battery life they claim is utter nonsense.

"Multiple connectivity issues could not be repaired and not easy to install.  Motion detection was always late, missing the cause of movement.

I like the ring stick up cam for the most part..but I am very disappointed about the night vision I thought that ring did a firmware update to make the wired stickup cam night vision color?

"Love it, but if I don't have the porch light on, it's too dark to see the intended area and when I have Ring on to view, it disconnects often.

"The overall quality of the product is good, and the video and audio quality are good.  The Ring app is easy to use.  I own total of 4 Ring devices and they all work well.

"We have had this product for a little over a week. Easy install and worked great until...… we began to have wi-fi problems. The signal was too weak. We bought a wi-fi extender, but it was still too weak. Now we will try the one specifically designed for Ring and see how that works.Next problem, battery life....the reviews said the battery lasts a couple of moths at least. Nope. Ours is already dead. Took over 24 hours to charge and lasted a little over a week. Now, we MUST order the solar panel in order to make the purchase worthwhile.",3,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0

I like that its good and clear day or night . Light sources like headlights tend to blind it at night. Mine failed after 6 months. Called ring  promised to send one in 5 days took them 3 weeks and I had to call. I didd get a brand new replacement. Monitoring is only $3/month.,4,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0

"The greatest issue with the Ring security cam is the frequent Wi-Fi disconnects. If you are home, it is inconvenient because you have to go out and reconnect it every time. If you are away from home or traveling for an extended time there is no way to reconnect the Wi-Fi, which totally defeats the purpose of having a security camera in the first place.

"I purchased this to work with my ring alarm system and several indoor cameras. Initially it works fairly well, however, the camera periodically (every 2-3 days) loses the ability to connect to the internet and can only be reset by physically removing the camera from its base and manually pressing the reset. Placing these cameras out of easy access is therefore challenging. The camera then works fine for another couple of days before repeating the cycle.

Seems to work when it wants to more than when it should. It captures video for about 30-60 seconds then when the person reappears or exits the house it fails to video again. Sometimes my app fails to properly record video and all i get is a black screen.,3,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"I gave it 3 stars in Motion detection because it didn't always catch movement, and 4 stars overall because they make you pay extra for a service for each devise in order to save recordings.

Does a great job in letting me know what it going on outside. Super easy to install and set up. No complaints at all.  I installed two of these around my pool area and near my sliders.  The alerts work perfectly.,5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0

"I got these installed on June 2, 2020 and loved them. Then on the weekend of the 14th one of the batteries was dead. I thought maybe because of my dogs being in and out so sloughed it off.

"This camera doesn’t work with any consistency. I’ve spent too much time on the phone with customer service and still it’s a disappointment. Better to invest a little more money if you actually care about monitoring your home. The battery drains quickly, the motion section is random and the zones are too limited.",1,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
I bought 2 from Best Buy and 2 from Amazon. The 2 from Best Buy have a battery life of about 30 days. The 2 from Amazon last about 2 weeks. I’m assuming I got old batteries from this Amazon store. I’ll be buying future Ring products from Best Buy.,2,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
Overall great product and does what I need. May not be as adjustable with zones as far as depth and custom options as the spotlight or floodlight. Just needed something less costly at the moment and getting two was a better option than 1 more expensive option for now. Some adjustments are still available and no issues at all. Self installed and setup easily.,5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
Live camera feed is not very reliable. Camera notify me that there is motion but does not allow me to see live feed. It sometimes takes up to an hour to start working. I have 2 stick up cameras and they both do not respond at the exact same time. I also have a ring door bell but that never has a problem connecting and allows me to see live feed any time. Maybe the ring spotlight camera will work better.,2,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"These work great! I added the solar panels which keep the batteries fully charged, even in the overcast PNW. Great picture, great adjustment on them. Definitely worth the price. I also added the Ring indoor chime so I know if any of my cameras have been activated without relying solely on my phone. I bought the Wifi extender too.

"Whenever live view works it's great, however 80-90% of the time it won't connect. It does record though while on the trial period, I haven't subscribed after the issues with live view. My Internet  connection can't be the issue because it's at 40 MBs and I stream videos with no issue. Ring specifies you require a minimum of 1 MBs speed. Plus all the cams except 1 are at full wifi signal. Therefore I can conclude the issue is either from the cams or their server's.

"Very easy to set up and has a wide view range. Can’t make out people’s faces unless the camera is  right at the door. So we may need to get a few additional cameras for that.

"Update 7/3/20:Ring customer support has reached out to me to offer a replacement camera at an additional charge that does what this camera was supposed to do. Additionally the replacement powers over ethernet, has ethernet, works with smartthings, has color night vision, and has a wider viewing area. That camera is the 2nd generation stick up camera, now known as the stick up camera elite. It is more expensive, but a better camera all around, though the price increase may not be worth it if you aren't considering running ethernet.",2,0,2020-5-23,1,1,1
Update: 1/17/2020RING tech support told me those missing features were still there as long as I bought the plug in version of Gen 3. Well... I went up to my local Best Buy and bought one. Low and behold I was right they removed those features. I placed my old and new cameras side by side and the new one didn’t start record until several seconds after I walked past.  My old camera in the other hand showed everything. The new camera didn’t even show me as I walked past at a brisk pace. I got the alert but not video of my body in the shot. The new one also didn’t let me draw the custom motion zones as they told me I would be able to. This also goes to show that even their Tech Support isn’t interested in really knowing their own products. They should be required to have them at least in a lab and when you ask them a direct question be able to test before lying to you. I’m very disappointed with RING why would they remove features from better versions??? If you want those wired features of the Gen 2s then don’t get these. If you were happy with the limited Battery features of Gen 2 then these are a slight improvement. The only good thing about Gen 3 is that they let you blackout areas for privacy like my bed so it doesn’t record my girlfriend and I going at it. Lol,2,0,2020-1-11,1,1,0
"Installed the plug in camera in my garage yesterday and it’s displaying a critically low battery warning even though it indicates it’s plugged in.  This version doesn’t even have a battery!  Reviewing online commentary, this is a common defect and the Ring team is supposedly working on it after identifying the root cause.  This concerns me as If it was a simple firmware update they should have fixed it already.  Hopefully it’s not a hardware issue. I’d hold off on getting this version until you know it’s been fixed.  Also, I believe that since the device thinks it has a critically low battery, it’s limiting motion detection and recording.  It doesn’t seem to be picking up or recording all motions even at the highest sensitivity.UPDATE 6/6/2020",4,0,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"After a couple weeks It says the battery is too low to view and doesn't notify you of movement. Amazon was aware of the issue when they sold it, and won't fix it. Countless people are having the same issue. Their work around is for you to purchase a battery for a corded camera. They should supply the battery if the corded version doesn't work, but they won't. Listed below is their response:""Edit as of 5/15/2020: Thanks for your continued input here. Please know that our teams are continuing to investigate this. We make sure to continue forwarding all user experiences over to the team and of course will provide any updates we get as they come in.""",1,0,2020-5-20,1,1,0
"Have had my Ring stick up cams for about a year now, which joined my Ring door bell pro.  The battery life is quite good among my 3 Ring stickup cams.  I bought a spare battery that I keep charged and ready to replace when I get a notification that battery is low in one of the cams.  There is plenty of time to replace it before it's drained.  I did have to upgrade my wifi router to a MESH wifi system to get coverage to all parts of the home for the cams to work.  Depending on where you mount your cams, wifi signal may be a problem.  The battery version of the cam is not as functional but far more versatile in terms of mounting and you are not limited to where you get power.  You will have to factor in the $10/month for Ring Protect cloud recording.  The app works well, and is all-in -one for Ring camera and security products.The reliability is high and so is the picture quality.  Also, the motion detection is scalable and is a noticeable improvement over my Amcrest cameras that have false alarms all the time.",4,0,2019-12-11,1,1,0
My internet went out while away on a ten day road trip. Two days it was out and EVERY OTHER WIFI SWITCH AND DEVICE WENT BACK ONLINE WITH NO ISSUE. EVERY SINGLE ONE.But not my ring cams.

I am not happy with this latest Gen 3 version of stick up camera. It took countless hours with tech support to get the firmware to update. I had hoped that once the firmware was updated to the current version it would connect with my SmartThings Hub. This lack of integration is frustrating since my Doorbell Pro and my stick up cam Gen 2 version is integrated. I had been slowly replacing my old stick up camera Gen 1 cameras to the Gen 2. Only to receive this Gen 3 version so buyer beware that these will have tech problems as many other reviewers have said as well.,2,0,2020-9-17,1,2,0
"I have the Ring Doorbell 2 and the Stick Up Cam interfacing through a Chime device (glorified extender). There is still considerable lag between both devices and my phone app. I consistently only register a signal strength from both of about 55-58 db, which is great for reviewing but horrible for real time responding. I have the indoor cam on a cabinet about 8 feet high and set the sensitivity at maximum. The camera image is similar to a fish-eye and you'd be hard pressed to positively identify any unknown person through the video. In the kitchen/family room area, if I don't have a dim light on at night, the recorded image is unusable in my opinion even tho it does offer a certain level of security and peace of mind. Having the devices connected to my Alexa is of no value and is a novelty more than anything else. In simple terms, coupled with the $60 a year necessary to preserve videos, given the decision whether to buy again, I'd pass. The devices simply do not live up the hype and are a disappointment, in my opinion.",3,0,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"Works okay with the subscription. Pretty useless with out it, live view doesn't work 90 % of the time with out the subscription. I have a ring flood, paid for subscription and that works fine and bought this to cover the back yard just for live view if the the flood went off and maybe they made it to the back with the delay in notification, but ended up pretty useless after 30 days trial ended.",3,0,2020-5-22,1,3,0
I pre-ordered both this and the newest indoor camera at the same time.  The indoor camera arrived first and was setup first.Imagine my surprise when the outdoor camera came and I was not able to setup precisely defined motion zones!

"So after racking my brain trying to figure out why a 1080p camera gives jagged lines, even with a 200mb internet connection... it's that the camera drops down to 720p (looks almost like 480p) when it can't sense an opposing wall or object. All other tech site reviews show amazing resolution and even my Ring doorbell camera has higher resolution, but ONE site reported 720p resolution if the camera is pushed in trying to see over a distance.I've got mine mounted above the garage about 15 feet above ground looking down. Distance to end fo drive way is about 21-22 feet.",2,0,2020-7-18,1,1,1
I do not understand why people are complaining.  It works exactly as described.  Ring never said it would operate the moment the box opened.  It does take a little effort; maybe 5 or 7 min.  I did have to use a latter to install one of the cameras so I expected maybe 3 minutes longer on that device.  If you are unable to get out of a chair this device is not for you.  The descriptions clearly say most devices take batteries and that means they do not last forever.  If you want a camera that does not require you to change batteries then you need to get a wired device.  I am electronically challenged and had no difficulty installing the camera and lights.  Climbing the latter was the hardest part.,5,0,2019-10-28,1,2,0

I immediately took out the battery as I was shaking from fear. After further research I found multiple articles where WiFi cameras get hacked. I ended up returning the camera and got a regular baby monitor. I do not feel safe with these cameras inside my home where hackers can see and hear everything.

"I'll try to keep this short. The concept is great, and one camera worked very well as a test. So I bought nine more, to spread around the outside of my house. They seemed to work for a while, but I noticed that whenever I wanted to view a camera, it would take so long to ""activate device"" that by the time it came on, whatever was happening in front of the camera was over. There were issues accessing the timeline, it took a long time to track back and access older videos. This was all using the Ring app on Android. Then I tried using the website, and OMG what a disaster. First of all, they REQUIRE you to use two factor authentication, which means that whenever you want to log into their website, they send you a text message with a code you have to enter to complete login. This might seem nice, and adds to the security, but it gets really annoying after a while particularly since they don't have any option to remember your login between sessions, or remember a device like your browser. Nope, you have to do the smartphone dance every time. Why is this bad? Because it's an annoying waste of time that I should be able to disable, that's why. Also what if I'm at work or away from my phone? Or my wife wants to access the camera from her work, and she doesn't have my phone, obviously? She can't access it. There should be an option to disable 2FA, but they have removed this, if it was ever there.Another annoyance is that when I try to scroll back through the history for a camera on the website, the only way to get back to early June to download my earliest videos (which I'd like to keep) is to laboriously scroll down in the browser through the ""endless scrolling"" mechanism, which means I have to sit there and scroll down the history until it stops, wait for it to catch on that it's at the end and loads more, scroll down again until it stops again, wait again, rinse and repeat. This is extremely tedious! And then, when I finally reached the video I wanted, I checked it, and the damn thing went blank. I couldn't even download it, and when I did something else to try to get the page back I WAS RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED AND HAD TO DO THE SCROLLING TORTURE AGAIN. I gave up in disgust.",1,0,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"I bought two of these to add to my Ring setup. I have 2 existing battery powered doorbell cams installed. Battery life on the doors is far superior to the stickup cam. On the doors, both are which on busy sidewalks and triggered all day and night a charge lasts about 3 weeks. Not bad. These stickup cams which operate on the same battery last about a week if I'm lucky, less if motion alerts are on. Image quality is great and it's nice to have a consolidated app. I was planning to add a couple more on my exterior walls of my 3 story row house but cannot due to the frequent battery changes. Do yourself a favor and mount these where you have easy access. I may experiment with a solar charger but really, for the cost, weekly required battery changes are excessive.",3,0,2020-1-17,1,1,0

"I just purchased the new stick up wired cam direct from Ring after waiting several weeks for it to be released. I am very disappointed. This is my second Ring camera - same model and I give the first design 5 stars.With the original, you could manually choose your motion detection field with much flexibility. Ring chose to change the motion detection selection in this model by using a slide button which puts a blue haze over your coverage field but it only gives you motion coverage for the lower half of the screen. So what is viewed in the top half will not trigger an alert. This is ok if you only have a distance of about 30 feet to cover but terrible if you want back yard coverage. Seriously Ring, what are you thinking? This will go back in the box and returned and I will have to seek another manufacturer.  I can not recommend. Ring dropped the ball on R&D with this one.  11-19-19 update- Ring customer service contacted me and we have satisfactorily resolved the issue so I’m upgrading my review to 3 stars.  Thank you Ring for good customer service.",3,0,2019-11-2,1,1,1

It is super easy to use. The app is very friendly. Save the videos before deleting them. The app will delete them after certain time. You need good strong WIFi and good spots.  I am not that technical and with Ring, you are not afraid of using the app or the cameras. The set up of the cameras is done super fast. Strong and sturdies.

"So I have the Ring Pro doorbell which mostly works as it should, and I thought getting a stick up cam for my basement walk out would be a easy addition. Wrong. I struggled to get a decent wifi signal just 20 ft from my router (I'll add that the Pro doorbell is also close by but needs the chime pro repeater just to maintain a mediocre connection) and every time I plugged the stick up cam in for power, it would disconnect my doorbell from wifi. The only way I could get the doorbell to reconnect was by unplugging the stick up cam. I even set up a separate wifi network, specifically for the stick up cam, but it still refused to maintain a connection between both devices and the app. So that's it for me, sorry Ring. It really shouldn't be this hard to connect another device to your app. It's clear that you cheaped out on the most important component in your devices - the wireless chip, and for that reason, I'm out.",1,0,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"I ordered these indoor cameras mainly for window coverage of areas where the outdoor cameras weren't able to see. Although these have limitations with motion detection through a window, there are a few workarounds that help significantly. You have to turn off the InfraRed motion detection to avoid the camera getting just it's reflection in the window. Also, the ""link"" feature is a life-saver. I have linked the front window camera to the doorbell camera, so that if the indoor camera doesn't pick up the motion (mostly happens at night), then the doorbell camera will trigger the window camera giving me more video coverage. This helps tremendously to catch a wider view. I have 3 of the indoor cameras, 2 in windows pointed outside and 1 in the garage. They are not ideally shaped for windows so they are a bit precarious and I'm looking into some stronger double sticky tape to make them a bit more stable. I don't mind pulling out the batteries to charge them, but they do seem to take an exorbitant amount of time to charge. I would have gotten the power cord ones, but that limits where you can put them. All in all, a good buy and I'm happy with the purchase.",3,0,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"This is my 3rd ring product, this camera can only be used indoor to watch bedroom or living room online, Please note this has no good mounting options to mount outside, I saw many videos of non-battery version of this product, and assumed it comes with similar mount and wanted to use this as an alternate for ring door bell, because my entrance is exposed to rain and sun I can’t use ring doorbell.  Also this can't be used near wet surface because water can go inside the battery chamber. This doesn’t work with google home products for live view. I thought only door bell and this product works with Alexa echo show, hence I also bought amazon echo show. I was wrong, my ring floodlights also work with Alexa.I had hard time setting this up, once ring app detects the product, app keeps saying product is updating software.

I tried with chimepro for first time, eventhough chimepro was few feet away, this would not respond, My advice is not to physically install this product before setup.

"OMG...I really wanted to like these stick up cams by Ring but there are quite a few issues. Firstly, the maximum they will record is :30 seconds. Then there is a gap of time before they will record again...if at all...until an incident is over. Biggest issue is that these cameras have a difficult time running properly due to problems getting a strong wifi connection and drop offs in wifi connections! And, according to our numerous live chats with tech support, they need to be within 20 feet of your router to work properly. If they don't work properly, be prepared for many hours on Live Chat trying to figure things out...and then they will tell you to purchase one of their Chime Pros to extend your wifi so the cameras work better. We tried that and it had no effect. Then the rep on Live Chat tried to sell another one of their products ( a mesh network router) for $299 to make their cameras work better. It's ridiculous. These cameras are loaded with problems. We purchased Wyze cameras and they are a lot less, do not have the internet/wifi issues, and also offer long, continuous recording times as long as there is motion, in the cloud for only $1.49 a month. Ring has wifi connection issues and wants you to pay $3 a month per camera and will only record :30. seconds of an incident at a time. Buyer beware.  We found out there are way too many problems and do not feel very secure with these ""security"" cameras. These are going back.

"A step back in tech compared to their floodlight and spotlight cams, which I am very happy with (even though I don’t use the lights often in either) Motion detection on this is no longer a custom geo field, but adjust whether you want it to detect the bottom half of the camera or just the middle. Does not have motion detection for top half of field of view. Night vision is poor and can hardly see what the object is, only that something is moving.

(Power via Ethernet, custom motion sensing zones) Never did I think watching the reviews that ring would release a ""new"" version of this product that was entirely stripped down.  A oversight on my part for sure, but I really think they should have done something better than this shady naming scheme.

Internet speeds are fine, RSS at 43 but still multiple attempts at trying to connect to camera for live feed. These are um, what is the word, novelties at best.

This is upsetting now that I've realized Ring  sells a product that claims 3-6 months of battery life, but that battery life is only if the camera isn't in use/doesn't capture any movement...UPDATE: I spoke with customer support and they confirmed the problem is that the camera is placed in an area with high traffic and it would be better if I moved it elsewhere, or reduced the sensitivity so it won't capture as much.  I previously had it on a lower sensitivity and it completely missed someone walking by it at night.  Their suggestion was to reset the camera and then continue testing it.  (just what I want to do, spend more time than the 2-hours per week I already spend on the phone w/Ring).

"We have a Ring Doorbell cam, a Ring Floodlight Cam and a Ring wired Indoor cam, and we love them all.  Great resolution and customized motion zones.  So we bought 2 battery Stick Up cams for areas without easy electrical availability and we hate them and we are returning them.  The battery cameras do NOT let you set up customized motion zones, they only let you adjust ""sensitivity"". We can't customize the areas that we need the motion monitoring to cover.  The sensitivity range only covers the bottom half of what the camera captures, so we needed to point the cameras higher to detect motion in the yard, and therefore lost visibility to the driveway up close. Also, when the motion starts to record, there is one second of ""blinding"" white that obscures the initial motion.  The resolution is also not as good. We do not have any of these problems with the wired cameras. We will run extension cords and buy wired cameras instead for these last two locations.  Nowhere on the Ring website do they point out the differences in motion zone settings.",1,0,2019-11-19,1,1,0
Motion detection with these are horrible. You can turn zones on and off and thats about it. I have been trying to get the distance set for over a month. I want it to pick up from the house to the sidewalk. I get every car that drives by on the street but if you walk down the sidewalk it doesn't go off.  You have to get with in 10 feet of it. So it has no motion detection from 11' to about 25' which seems to be its blind spot. I bought 3 of these. Waste of money.,1,0,2020-1-4,1,1,0

"This is my second Stick Up Cam Battery (solar).  I returned the first as the night vision was so much worse than my ring doorbell and my ring flood light cam (with the light off).  The second Ring Stick Up cam is exactly the same as the first, so I can only assume that it is a difference between the battery and wired devices.  The first screenshot is my doorbell cam with only the night vision active, you can clearly see the deer eating from my bird feeder.  The second photo is the same deer after they have moved into the back yard, and you can barely make out the deer less than 10 feet from the camera.  The doorbell IR lights up an area out to about 25 to 30 feet.  In the back yard, you can barely see what is directly in front of the camera.Update: I was contacted by ring and they took a look at my camera. They suggested that I point it down toward the ground more as the infrared lights we're shooting out into nothing. Now that the IR lights are hitting the grass I have a well-defined area (roughly 30 feet) that is fairly well lit.  It is not as bright as the infrared from the floodlight cam - with the flood lights off of course, but it is acceptable.",4,0,2020-2-4,1,0,1
"I love the ring product suite but after buying a stick-up cam to expand coverage I learned the motion detection range is not the same as the other devices.  On other devices you can customize the motion detection field by sizing it to meet your needs.  The stick up cam motion zones are fixed.  They are either on or off, but you cannot change their size.  Plus the range is shorter so you need more cams to cover an area, in my case.  Still a good product but it could have been Great if the motion zones were better.",4,0,2019-12-15,1,1,0
"I have the ring alarm at 2 locations and the sensors, the base station, cellular backup for the alarm and all the features are great.  The cameras seem to have the same feel, great field of view and night vision video, but they just are not anywhere near consistent enough to provide actual visual security.  I’d say a third of the time I try and connect live feed the camera video will not connect.  Other times I will get an alert to motion and when I go to review the video it will not load no matter which device I try and retrieve it on or how long I wait to view it.  And then there’s the big elephant in the room that the cameras don’t record 24/7 until a dvr is full type setup, they just record when prompted, either by motion detected or when a live look in happens.  I can’t tell you the amount of times over the past year I’ve lost some footage either by the motion detection being too slow, the 30 second at a time clip runs out, or simply not being able to retrieve the actual video because of some problem within ring itself.  I am an owner of a computer networking company and have wireless everywhere and a gigabit connection to the internet so these issues are not as a result of poor infrastructure.  I would not buy any ring camera if you need 100% reliable video security.  This solution does not provide that for the reasons stated above.

"SHORT BATTERY LIFE, INCONSISTENT DETECTION and NO REAL-TIME VIDEO.  I am really disappointed in this product.  This camera is just a way to sell monthly subscriptions and it is a waste of money.  When the free subscription runs out, you can no longer view past detections and you also lose the ability to see any real time video as well. Without the monthly subscription, the camera is JUST A HANDS-FREE DOORBELL WITHOUT A PEEP HOLE.  And there is nothing in the product descriptions or the operating manual that mentions the loss of real-time viewing.  And by the time you figure that out on your own, it is too late to return.  Just annoying really.Additionally, the camera has a short battery life.  The device detection settings were at only 75% sensitivity with Motion Verification “on”.  The battery only lasted only two weeks. It takes overnight to charge which means that your camera is out of service for one full day every two weeks unless you buy a second battery for $40.  Also, with frequent battery changes, the device has to be located in a spot convenient to access.  That means it is also convenient to vandalize or steal.",1,0,2020-2-27,1,0,0

"Already own 2 other ring cameras ( spotlight cam) and they setup and worked like a charm.

I tried everything and again backwards (could go in more detail, but want to keep this short) because I really wanted this cam to work.

It’s pretty sad that Ring had an entire section in their  FAQ’s about rotating the view to hang upside down. Then remove the feature to sell a new mount for $20. What a crappy company.

Setting up and installing the ring stick up camera was very easy. I have purchased the solar panel to keep the battery charged. I had originally thought something was wrong with the battery because it kept dying. It was because it was set up in the app as being wired not battery operated.

"The camera is nice and the range of view is good. However, there are two things about the camera that are disappointing to me. One is you need a very, very strong wifi signal for the unit to function well. I even put a wifi extender in the attic to bring the signal closer to the camera but it only helps a little. The other disappointment is the distance of the motion detection range. It doesn't extend very far out at all. So even though the camera ""sees"" far out  and the picture is clear, it can only sense motion a short distance. Unfortunately, the motion detection zone cannot be adjusted out very far.

We have six Ring cameras. We bought four over a year ago and liked them very much. So we ordered two more a couple of months ago. We were very disappointed with the new ones.  The construction and design have changed. It is not as well made and attaching it outside is not as flexible. Most important however is the fact that the video quality is much worse. I doubt it is 1080P anymore and the width of the viewing angle is narrower.  Overall is it a much poorer quality product.  If image quality matters to you don't buy this product. Ring is obviously sourcing them from a different company in China and the poorer quality really shows.,1,0,2020-7-24,1,0,0
The image is great and if you want to watch live action all the time it works for that.  The problem is the notifications are extremely unreliable.  Sometime it works but most times it doesn't.

Stick up cam (battery version) works great.  It’s actually hard to turn the sensitivity down but after playing w it enough - got it right.

"This Ring Stick Up Cam gets the job done but there are a few notable flaws that are worth mentioning.Ring released this new generation of the Stick Up Cam in October 2019. I pre-ordered it and got it on the first day it came out. I like the fact they lowered the price to $100 vs. the $180 the 2nd generation stick up cam cost. Although, along with lowering the price, they did remove some features that were in the 2nd generation. No POE (Power over Ethernet) which provided a more stable connection than Wi-Fi, no siren, and smaller field of view (110° horizontal, 57° vertical on this camera) vs. 2nd generation's 150° horizontal, 85° vertical.",1,0,2019-11-1,1,0,0

"The zones for motion detection are left, right and center but they are not adjustable for distance.  So unless you can tilt the camera down far enough, things that you would like to ignore, such as pedestrians just passing by will trigger the motion sensor and send out unnecessary alerts.  So the pivot is too limited to do that.  If it could do that, then you could lose the view of the action that passes by when the camera has been triggered by motion.  You might not be able to see a car service or taxi that you ordered.The night vision is pretty good with the infrared.  If big nearby objects are in the view and reflecting the light back to the camera, then the camera is blinded because it functionally drops the aperture and darkens the intruder's face.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

"The audio on this thing is useless. The picture is pretty good. The motion ""zone"" options are pretty sad, really. Battery life is so so depending on how often it's triggered.
