"First of all this camera is freaking amazing for the price! I searched for literal hours on youtube trying to figure out which affordable action cam to buy and out of frustration it took me about 2 days because each review of a camera, had a cheap action camera with missing features and sub-par reviews!!On day two I came across a youtuber with this specific  camera and was amazed! This camera has everything you need to get some amazing video shots and even comes with a bundle of accessories that would total over 1k probably if you were to try to get the go pro. The best part is that this camera shoots great high quality footage in 1080p and is so easy to carry around.  Its awesome that they include 2 batteries because action cams in general tend to have a short life span and with 2 batteries and my battery pack (see photo) I literally can get 3+ hours of use out of this thing! Its easy charge both overnight, once you use one battery plug the usb battery charger (included) into your travel battery pack and keep filming, you literally can just keep filming even out in the middle of nowhere and not have to worry about camera life.... This thing is AWESOME!!!",5,1,2018-4-8,1,1,1

This is my first waterproof camera. I bought it for my snorkeling trip in Thailand. The place that we went snorkeling was a bit deep so most of pictures that I took from the surface were not very good. But If you use this camera to take pictures close up it works well. I think it depends on depth and lighting too. Also no leaks and it’s very good  for the price.,4,1,2019-1-1,1,2,1
"I wanted an action camera to document fishing trips and other outdoor activities but didn't know too much about them so I was uneasy about spending ~$300 on a GoPro. After searching hundreds of reviews, I decided on the AKASO EK7000 to test out the functionality and usefulness of an action camera. I was blown away..The picture quality was unreal. I hope the video I uploaded does it justice. I use 1080p 60fps instead of 4K to preserve memory and battery. Be sure get a good quality micro SD card with a high write speed! I use a 64GB UHS class 3 with 60MB/s which is about 6 hours worth of video at this quality. After a day of events, you can transfer the videos onto a computer and then delete the files on the SD card to have a fresh 6 hours again. The included wrist band has a record button that makes it really easy to start recording video mid-action. Also included were several accessories and attachments as well as 2 batteries. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I just passed the 1 year mark with this camera and haven't even thought about buying another action cam.",5,1,2019-7-27,1,2,0
"I bought the ""ACASO EK7000 ULTRA HD 4K"" camera, after a friend of mine recommended me not to take my regular video handheld Cannon camera to those extreme conditions of northern Norway in winter because it will be hard to handle doing the activities we had planned over there.I was little skeptical but I bought the camera anyhow. I took also we me also our handheld camera which we used only 1 day in Stockholm and because it was warm winter day. The ""EK7000"" it was really neat and easy to use with your mobile phone I stuck the the camera in chest with the provided accessory leaving my hands free to handle the dogs and the sledge during our mushing (video attach) experience. I highly recommend getting one in fact I will be getting another one soon.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,1,0
"For the price, I did not expect much. However, the camera does indeed take decent videos. I only use 1080P 60FPS mode and while it does not compare to my video shot on my  400 dollar Canon camcorder, it's not bad.  I wish I had spent $20.00 extra and bought the model with image stabilization, but too late now. One problem I had was that in the auto power off mode, the camera would shut itself off, and I could not get it to turn back on without pulling out the battery and reinserting. I shut the auto battery/power saver off on the menu and this corrected the problem. The camera has a short learning curve. I wanted a discrete small camera to use candidly and also mount on the handlebars of my bike and it works good, as well as a dash cam in my car. However, hanging the camera on my chest and walking around, there is just too much jumping around without image stabilization. The sound is about fair, but for my purposes, it is ok as I am not interviewing anyone. As I said, if I had it to do over again, I would buy the camera model with image stabilization. However, I am happy with the purchase as I could not afford a Go-Pro.  Decent resolution inside a house with just daylight.  For me, battery life is OK, as I have shot 20 minutes continuous video on one of the two batteries that come with it.",5,1,2019-3-9,1,1,1
This camera is great! I don't do any action sport but I needed a camera for underwater pictures and videos during my vacation. And the result is very good!,5,1,2019-3-22,1,1,1
"I researched and reviewed and went to forums and and and to find a action cam that would suite my needs and I found the perfect match.  I have put this camera through just about everything and it still runs.  I've dove to over 100ft deep (make sure to get a red lens filter) , gone dirt biking across idaho, climbed to tall mountains, gone downhill skiing, snowmobiling, swimming, snorkeling, running, biking, cycling, sledding, cliff jumping, put it on a drone (and crashed drone with it), cave tubing, river rafting, and the list goes on and on.  I am not easy on equipment  so wanted a device to hold up to my demand.  That and if I did something like run it over or drop it out of a plane or who knows what to actually destroy it I wouldn't be out 100s of dollars like with a gopro but a $100 or so.  I actually purchased another one for my wife and kids to use which they are putting through the tests as well.  I have a few sd cards I change out and an ipad to download to the ismart dv app.  Just have to put the camera in wifi mode connect to it on your device open up ismart dv and download pictures and videos.  I usually just edit on my iphone or ipad using the photo program.  Then either send off to family and friends and/or post on facebook or other places.  I ended up buying the large accessory kit for each camera, with extra batteries.  I have used most all the attachments and enjoyed all the possibilities it gives me to video all my adventures with family and friends.  So many positives and few issues.  I think the only issue I really have had is the certain camera I have has not kept an accurate date no matter if I program it or not.  The one I purchased for my wife and kids keeps the date fine.  I am currently working with company on figuring it out and they have been great about responding to me and making sure to work through the situation which I appreciate A LOT.  The only other thing is battery life but that goes for all devices, you never have enough battery life so I just bring along an extra battery as well as a portable charger.  Can't say enough about this awesome little video camera and all that I have put it through only to enjoy it more.  THANK YOU AKASO and I will continue to share with others and buy for others.  I run a computer/technology shop so I do my research and deal with plenty of problematic devices and this is one I don't have to worry about.  Play on!",5,1,2019-7-1,1,1,1
"I bought this cameral for a trip to Key West. Pictures and videos turned out great!! Video is the default for this camera, which caused me many lost pictures and the only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating. Easy to use, Never had any problems with using under water.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,9,1
"I ordered this camera in 2017, expecting to lightly use it for mountain biking, a trip to the Virgin Islands, and for occasional other action sports. Reviews led me to believe this camera was worth the price considering the features it had and its overall quality.After a few uses over 4 months, I was happy with the camera and its functionality. The inclusion of only one battery with the camera itself was disappointing, however the same model battery can be found elsewhere easily enough. It took decent footage,  however sound was poor and the waterproof case for the camera is a poor fit so the camera rattles constantly (remedied by a small piece of rubber band between camera and case).",1,1,2019-1-29,1,7,0
"We recently went snorkeling in Honduras and Belize, and this camera did wonderfully. Video was perfect as were the stills. Went down about 30 feet and the waterproof case held up as advertised. Just like photos on land, shoot away from the sun to avoid too much green tinging under the water. I've also used a GoPro Hero which offers the same features, for more than triple the cost of this...there was no difference in quality. Thank you Akaso for allowing me to shoot such great memories of this trip!",5,1,2019-7-18,1,6,1
"I first ordered this in late February 2019. Unfortunately the microSD card slot was defective and I returned the camera. (The contact was bad and recordings could be corrupted if the camera was bumped, and thinner microSD cards would just not be recognized outright.)The company reached out to me after my initial review and explained that the unit I had received was two years old and had been returned because it was defective but was somehow sent out again as if it were new. They provided a newer model and accessories as way of apology. The difference in the products over the two year timespan shows that the company does pay attention to quality issues.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,9,0
"Great deal for a great little camera! Bought this for taking pictures in / under the water for a trip to the Philippines and didnt feel like spending hundreds. It certainly has some quirks and a learning curve, but it works great and definitely can't beat the price! Photo quality is great, would give 4 stars for some of the quirks but gets a bonus star for the great price!Some notes:",5,1,2017-2-11,1,6,1
Underwater footage outstanding!! I do a lot of icefishing and this camera is beyond my expectations for quality!!  Quality is just as good  even if you are not using it underwater.  I am 100% satisfied!!!!,5,1,2019-2-7,1,7,1
"I just tested the waterproof casing of this camera and proved to be satisfying, I placed one of my aquarium display inside the bucket half full of water and submerged the camera to take a screenshot of it, I tried to stabilize the camera while I pressed the remote to take the shot.  I have to put some lighting because it is too dark outside.You can't go wrong with this camera, I'll bring this camera to my trip to Legoland and to a cruise in couple of months.",5,1,2018-12-30,1,9,1
"P.O.S.! First, it Wi-Fi’s to your device for use. Why? Why not “Bluetooth “ ! Because now, I can’t watch the video on my iPad because I don’t have Wi-Fi because I’m using it for this thing! If you use Wi-Fi to set it up and start/stop video, it stops recording on its own! So I use the button to start/stop the recording. It stopped and started on its own 4 times. Some videos are a few minutes, some are more! Then I’m scrolling through the options trying figure out why and... guess what the other word for delete is? .....Format!! Yep, I pressed that and it deleted everything!! No prompt, no this will delete any pics or videos you have, nothing. I was so P.O. I threw the camera against the wall smashing it to pieces! There, hows that for a review!",1,1,2018-6-11,1,5,0
"Update 4/9As you can read below I had some issues with my camera. I did not contact support, they contacted me from my review. They have been more than supportive and helpful with my issues and immediately offered a replacement. We had several correspondences between us that were all focused on me being happy. They sent a replacement camera and a return label for the other one. They did ask me to update my review based on that. I am happy to update it as they have done everything possible to make me happy.",5,1,2018-3-13,1,8,0
"Update 27.11.2017 : The customer service were extremely helpful ,Software updates and close follow up but the camera had to be sent to the factory . As i am outside US and shipping it back will cost a lot , they proposed a full refund . This 1st class worldwide behavior and AKASO will certainly will be a well none brand around the world . Thanks !I was able to capture couple of minutes and i have to say the camera videos quality are stunning !",5,1,2017-10-9,1,9,1
"Worked Great for my Hawaii Snorkeling Adventure, Great clear pictures!! Noticed that pictures turned out the Best/clearest when the sun was on my back. Otherwise it still takes good pictures its just that you'll get more of a water color in the picture. Awesome camera, I don't have/used a gopro but, I do have another underwater camera that I've used on previous vacations and this is leaps and bounds better!! This was awesome to take video as well of the Turtle I followed around for awhile and the 4' Moray eel and Barracuda.",5,1,2018-1-28,1,1,1
"This is a very good camera. I was surprised by how small it is which is a huge plus.  The quality of the photos and videos are good but don't expect the same quality you would get from a more expensive camera or those professional cameras. Akaso EK7000 is very easy to use. I'm able to transfer photos and videos either by using the iSmart DV app to sync with my iPhone, by plugging the Micro USB to USB cable to my computer or by manually sticking the memory card in my computer. I purchased a separate selfie stick (it does not come with the regular package) and so far I'm enjoying this camera. The remote control included with the camera is also very helpful. I'm no photo expert so I didn't see a reason to buy something ultra expensive such as a Go Pro. I'm mainly interested in shooting videos while riding my bike and under water pictures when snorkeling and going to water parks.Note that the battery doesn't seem to last long, but the camera comes with 2 batteries and you can use the same portable batteries you use for your phone to recharge Akaso's battery, so if you're on the go, while you use one you can let the other charging in your backpack and just swap them as needed.",5,1,2017-8-2,1,9,1
"Honestly the quality was pretty good, needed a camera for our cruise to Cozumel and it worked out great when we went snorkeling. The upload quality turns out a bit different though. The WiFi worked good when I would have my chest or head harness on, I could just connect to my phone to see everything. Waterproof case worked great camera is still working 🤞🏾 Battery life was good",5,1,2018-5-4,1,1,0
"I wanted to much to write a great review on this product. The company has been awesome. I had written a bad review of this model before, and they contacted me and sent me a new one, which had the same issues, so they sent me an upgraded V50 Pro as long as I removed the bad review,  and I expected to give such a better review, but sadly aside from great customer service, this camera is very poorly made. Both cameras are very very lightweight, and lack sustenance. My biggest issue with the EK7000, was the wifi and remote camera functions. It was awful. If the camera was more than 10 feet from my phone, the Wifi would drop. Also the battery door was super cheap and flimsy and could fall off as it did not seat very well. The pictures were nice quality, but I needed remote access for snorkeling videos. We also found that the waterproof case hinge rusts after only 1 swim (see Picture).  The new version that they sent me has a better looking waterproof case it might last longer, although we did not put it in the water yet. The camera is sturdier, and seemed like it might hold up longer. I tested the video, and ran a video for about 15 minutes, and picked up the camera to stop the video, and it was almost too hot to touch. It was overheating drastically. I believe if I had it running longer, it would have damaged the internal components. The wrist remote looks and feels much sturdier until you try to push the buttons which can only be properly pushed in the direct center, if you push on either side, the buttons come up in the wrong way. Hard to explain, but just cheaply made and secondly it did not function with the camera at all. That's right, it did not work at all. The battery door is attached this time and functions correctly. I loaded the new cell phone app, and tried the remote access, it was very jittery and laggy when recording video  up to about 15 feet away, then fails. Unable to control the camera further away than that. Also saw that when loading the software, the program has terrible reviews.  We took some photos with it on Halloween night, and night work was not good at all, set on auto, it was unable to deal with low light situation (see Picture).  Finally when I tried working with the camera in the waterproof case, the buttons on top caused settings menu's to come up that I had to open the case in order to back out of as I had to use the touchscreen. It was sketchy at best. The customer service from these guys is great, but I'm sorry, I can not recommend this camera or the EK7000",1,1,2019-11-11,1,4,1
Pros:Inexpensive,2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,1
"A cheap knock off, made cheap plastic with cheap components. I am suspect of the posted specifications, but even if they are technically accurate, there is more to performance than specs on paper.  If you are filming in ideal lighting, and don't want audio, then this will probably work for you, but read on.Marginal video performance:",1,1,2017-11-26,1,5,0
"I wanted a gopro knockoff because I wasn't sure I even would use this type of device.  My first recording looked terrible, looked like I took on a 12 year old flip phone.  I then noticed that there was a bubble under the glass close to the middle of the lens.  Not sure how quality control could have missed this but now I have to try to work with Akaso because I am two days past the amazon return period.If you take a chance on this product test it right away don't be like me and wait a month.",1,1,2019-6-16,1,2,0
I don't understand why this product has such a high rating score. This cam is a robber.The quality of pictures are similar to the pictures taken with my first mobile have been 17 years ago. The videos are the worst.,1,1,2019-10-4,1,2,0

"Can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am.  Used a 32gb SanDisk SDCard formatted with FAT32. Worked perfect in my drone before. I tried the Asako at home and took a few videos and previewed them to make sure the files were being recorded. Spend the day at the water and recorded a bunch of rides with the kids.I get home and it says the source is corrupt and needs to be repaired on my windows 10 machine. I've never seen that happen with any cards from my drones, dslrs, etc.",5,1,2019-7-13,1,5,0
"We got this camera to take on our trip to Maui. We tried it out beforehand and found the playback to be of poor quality with lines waving through the video. We decided to give it another try and bought it again, Just returned from Hawaii was so disappointed with poor quality of footage of our snorkel experience. Horrible color, terrible video with wavy lines still on playback. Horrible product. Don't waste your time and money for the frustration. You are basically on your own to figure out how to operate it because the instructions are vague.",1,1,2018-7-21,1,2,0
"Came up as Amazon's best seller when I was looking for an action camera. I was very impressed with the packaging quality and the presentation. Got plenty of accesories for multiple functionalities like diving, biking and other activities. It was a great buy indeed!My only complaint is that I have is that it doesn't support EXTERNAL MIC. If the next generation of this camera would have that feature you'll definitely gain more profit. So what I did is I seach on Google and Youtube on how I can connect my Rode mic to it and I found plenty of them online. It's completely doable as you can see on the pictures. I bought a 3.5mm mount here in Amazon as well, had to tap into the Mic terminals positive and negative then drill a hole to lock in the mic port. Requires minimum soldering.",5,1,2017-3-19,1,2,1
"I bought this to film travel videos and reviews. So, many of the included attachments and accessories didn't interest me... I chose this camera because the reviews led me to believe it's competitive with GoPro cameras, but far less expensive.The reviews were right. The video quality is excellent. The lens captures a very wide area, horizontally, which is a plus if you want viewers to see absolutely everything. And, if you're using video editing software, you can always crop out what you don't want viewers to see.",4,1,2019-4-7,1,4,0
"I was so disappointed with this product!!!! I got recommendations from a friend who said this was a great alternative to a gopro if you didn't want to spend hundreds. I received the product and it wouldn't take a 32 GB microSD (even though they advertised that it would) and so I bought a 16 GB microSD (unable to return either SD card now). The thing finally turned on and when I tried taking a video, it just started glitching and lagging (the whole screen would go black for like 15 seconds before it looked like it was recording) and wouldn't actually save anything to the SD card. So, I tried all the ways to troubleshoot until I gave up and realized this was actually a garbage product. The whole thing also felt very light as if it was made with super cheap materials. I was so disappointed because I bought this camera to take with me for my fieldwork for my master's thesis to have long-lasting memories of all the hard work that went into my project. Not only was I unable to do that, I couldn't return any of the SD cards and had to pay for shipping to get the camera back to my house so my roommate could return it (with all the extra things I didn't take due to lack of space) after I had already left to do fieldwork. It was a waste of money and time- and extremely frustrating that it was such a let down. They did refund me after returning this product, but I would absolutely NOT recommend wasting your time/money with this product. Definitely NOT worth it!!!!!!",1,1,2019-1-7,1,6,0
"If you are very savvy with action cams and all the nuances associated with them, then your experience may be different than mine.  Mine was not positive and I returned the item.  #1:  The directions say to scan a QR code on the side of the box to download the Ez Cam application.  No QR code on my box, so I spent way too much time inspecting the box, manual, etc., looking for it, then had to search You Tube videos for answers.  Low and behold, in small print, the box says to down load some other application Smart IVD or something like that.  So there goes 1.5 hours of my time.  Then I download the application and try to connect the camera to my mobile devices.  It takes 2-4 tries before it connects, then it asks for a password.  Again, NOTHING in the directions about this.  Back to You Tube for another 45 minutes until I find a video that  provides the password as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0.  So 2+ hours to do what should have taken 15 minutes.Now to the operation.  I had a tough time turning the camera on in the case.  It would take pressing the button hard 4+ times before it would turn on and in some cases, I had to take it out of the case to turn it on.  The audio with the case on was bad and that is being kind.  Just not a good overall experience.  I would think these companies could hire someone to do a 5-minute You Tube tutorial, but I suspect these cameras are sold under 50 names and all have variables that would make any consistent directions impossible to provide.  After this experience, I purchased a GoPro and had it set up in 15 minutes.  If you have the time to research all the Bermuda Triangle stuff associated with these off brand action cameras, then purchase and save the money.  If your time and sanity are worth more than $100 in savings, then purchase a GoPro.",2,1,2018-4-8,1,5,0

Will need to update this in future but first trike ride video was at night and low light quality is similar to hero 4  that I use. Forgot it was in waterproof case so all sound was muted into a rough vibrating exhaust type tone. Have to remember to remove from case for better audio. Great battery life for my 1.5 test.Update 6/27/19 One hour ride with this camera installed in same position as hero 4 silver and all you hear is weird vibrating plastic sound when recording. Not gonna work for my needs. On bad idea shelf!,1,1,2019-6-23,1,4,0
"I'm a muralist and was looking for a less expensive alternative to the Go Pro for a time lapse I was starting last week.  I gave the AKASO EK7000 a shot based on the good reviews. I really was excited for the AKASO to work out, I am sad to say that I was disappointed. After spending about 30 min trying to figuring out the button combinations to access camera functions (which were a little tricky but I knew that going in based on the reviews read) I found it would start recording for 30- 45 secs before stopping  and then it would start on its own... breaking the videos into short second sections. Frustrating! The battery life was also disappointing which  I had to run a long extension chord just to charge the camera. (also knew that going in based on reviews)I hope to hear back from AKASO",1,1,2018-9-26,1,8,0
"Update: still haven't had a chance to try the replacement camera they sent me. The vendor has emailed me twice asking me to update my review. I explained I just moved and am in the middle of a renovation and it's still in it's original packaging. They we're pretty insistent on me changing it to 5 stars but kind of hard to do without using it. I understand their side, they were nice enough to send me a new one, I honestly just haven't had the time or opportunity. I will raise it to a 4 until I can actually review it again. As you can see it has great reviews for the price so I don't think you can really go wrong, especially if they fixed the buggy firmware. The video quality is great even with the buggy firmware. To be continued....Update: The vendor contacted me last week and offered to send me a new camera. I accepted and the camera arrived last Saturday. I haven't had a chance to try the camera out yet. As soon as I do I will update with my findings. It was nice that they were willing to send me a new camera. Stay tuned.....",4,1,2018-3-18,1,6,0
"I'm pretty excited about this action camera. I'm getting ready to go on a trip this weekend, so I bought this as my very first vlog camera to document my travels. I'm still learning how to use it, but the test videos I've done so far have turned out well and I'm excited to make some videos.My only real big complaint is that it didn't come with ANY sort of SD card, so the camera is as useful out of the box as a brick. Thank goodness I noticed this and had time to order an SD card before my trip. But I can't understand why it was sold without one at all. Why not just include a cheap one so people can at least USE the camera? The one I bought only cost $8. I would gladly spend $8 more on this camera and be able to use it right away without the hassle of having to make another order and wait for delivery.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"7/17/19 updated review: 1 Star as I’m very upset that the Akaso wrist mount failed even though the camera was securely and correctly installed (have used it a few times prior and it was fine).  The component on the top disconnected  during a snorkel trip today and now is at the bottom of the ocean floor. Original  review: 4 Stars. This unit is very affordable! After 2 months and multiple uses in the water, and adding an additional buy package of the accessories-- one of which was the wrist mount, so I can snorkel or dive as the head mount is great yet you have no control of when the camera is on or off or anything especially when you are making multiple videos in the ocean. Would have had 5 stars had they made the watch controller waterproof. I would expect that since this was advertised as water use which is why I specifically bought it. Make a case for the watch or new waterproof dive proof watch like the camera has case and 5 stars all the way around. As for longevity battery charge etc that remains to be seen. I will update this as time passes if anything fails.",1,1,2019-4-29,1,1,0
"This thing works very well for me, but may not for others. I bought this to serve as a dash cam in my Jeep, having moved my previous mirror based dash cam to my wife’s vehicle. I go through a T-intersection that has yield signs allowing the traffic coming from the railroad crossing to go through, but has poor visibility due to a hill and foliage, not allowing me to drive defensively very well while oncoming vehicles frequently ignore the yield signs (and have the nerve to get angry at me for not yielding to them). I feel it’s a matter of time before me or someone else gets tagged at this intersection.EDIT: Added a snipping tool screen capture of a moment right before a guy ran this yield sign and came inches from T-boning me. The video would not have shown the impact, but would have proven my case to an insurance company if needed.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,1

"I bought one of these cameras to mount to the front of my kayak.  It's very good for what it is, which is a cheap alternative to dropping $200 for a Go Pro.  I have only one complaint and one concern.First, the complaint.  My camera came with the ""power save"" option set to 3 minutes.  Now, I'm not exactly sure what ""power save"" does (whether it completely shuts it off or just puts the camera to sleep), but what I can tell you is that the wrist mounted remote won't wake it once it goes in to power save.  And with the camera mounted on the bow of my kayak where I can't reach it, I spent 3 hours on that trip thinking I was taking tons of photos and videos only to discover not a single one recorded.  This is partly my fault for not checking all the settings before I headed out, but I believe it's also a design flaw.  Why make a power save mode that the wrist remote can't wake the camera from?",4,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"I've been playing with this for 12 hours now and can't wait to take it on vacation! The camera takes great quality photos, and is pretty easy to get used to. I watched some Youtube tutorials and they were extremely helpful. The accessory pack is also great- lots of attachments, so I recommend anyone to search Youtube on the many uses of the attachments as well. There are also more ways to use the camera than I had originally thought. I also bought a high quality selfie stick that extends quite far, so it will be great for taking photos off the side of the boat, and off the side of cliffs while on our trip. The attachments that came with the camera are universal, so I can use the different attachments with the stick as well, including the waterproof case. It will be fun to play with these features while in Sicily and Greece!I almost forgot the wristband feature- it will be perfect for those long shots with the stick. You can put the band with the remote around your wrist, or on the handle of the stick.",5,1,2019-1-14,1,1,0
"First of all, I would like to say I did a ton of research and watched side by side video after video comparing them to the GoPro, read all the reviews and decided this must be a great deal. Boy was I wrong. Mounted it to my mountain bike for a 10 mile ride that took an hour. The battery died at about 35 minutes. The quality of the sound is very poor. I cant watch the video without muting the TV because of the static. The video set on the 2.7K setting was aweful, it had no detail and was very choppy video. Extremely low quality video especially in shadows or low light. If you are moving slow and in bright light the video is pretty good. Probably a decent price for the the quality but doesn't suit my needs at all. I will be saving up and buying a GoPro. I believe Akaso has the ratings they have because they offer free accessories, but only if you give them a 5 star rating. This is nothing more that a camera I don't mind letting my young children play around with now. Do yourself a favor and save up and buy the tried and true original.",1,1,2017-9-6,1,2,0
"I'm not really sure how this item has such good reviews, yes it's cheap but it just isnt worth it...The quality of pictures and videos looks like I took my old flip phone and use that instead. When I put it in to 4k mode it was oddly delayed and didnt seem to want to play back properly.",4,1,2019-5-1,1,1,0
"So far this camera seems to be a great buy! So cheap relative to the GoPro and it comes with so many mounts, two batteries, and some straps. The recording seems to be high quality as far as I can tell and the microphone is nothing special but it can definitely pick up a normal conversation. Looking forward to trying this out on my next trip!Update: brought it on my camping trip and almost every video I took ended up being a corrupted file. I took video over 3 days and only got ONE working video file. Also, the camera says 4K but it is a lie. It might have 4K pixels but the optical sensor is definitely way lower because the resolution looks to be the equivalent of 720p at best. You can see how low quality it is in the picture and that is at supposed 4K resolution!",1,1,2018-7-2,1,7,1
"I bought this for my trip to Hawaii. There are no instructions that come with this, so good luck if you’re not familiar with this kind of stuff. The camera would freeze whenever I tried to use it & not take any pictures/videos or even turn on/off. The pictures it did take were all bright white & blurry. This camera is awful. I just wanted pictures of my trip during my snorkeling excursions & this camera did not do that. It couldn’t even take pictures of my resort. They were do pixelated. Thank goodness for my phone camera because this one suck. Very cheap.",1,1,2019-2-20,1,7,0
I bought one before thought it would be a good gift. I rated this 5 stars when I bought mine almost a year ago. However Something has changed since then. The packaging is very cheap. I ordered a second one to give as a gift and the plastic the camera is mounted to was broken. The camera just rattled inside it’s little plastic cage. Didnt Want to give it like that so I ordered a new one and planned to take the first order back. Well I got the second and the same thing has happened the camera has been rattling around for who knows how long. Just looks tacky. I haven’t opened eaither since they are a gift but really disappointed.,1,1,2017-12-22,1,2,1

"Bought this for video taping my bike rides, but the bike mount snapped in half just by trying to install it. Spent a half hour with other  mounting kits and got it on anyway. later, had major issues trying to connect the wifi and its recommended app for the phone, and as it turns out, it says it has wifi, but it's not what you would think. It doesn't connect to your wifi, you have to connect to its wifi. It's a kind of backwards thinking thing. So you must change your phone wifi from your home or business wifi connection and connect to the camera wifi and then do the download there. Still, this doesn't get things on your computer, so you are better off just using the usb or popping the SD card out.",3,1,2017-8-21,1,6,0
"I have only had this a few days but took it out for a bit of a shakedown. This camera comes with all the mounts you're likely to need, so I attached it to my bike, and went for a little Father's Day bike tour. I'm putting the resulting video here. I did a little post using After Effects, but not much was needed. I'm really pleased. It's not like I'm making videos for NatGeo Channel or the like; it's just for fun, and fun was what I had. I do indeed recommend if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on similar cameras.ADDENDUM: 7.10.2020",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"I’m never quick to give a poor rating on something. I try to be honest without my emotions getting the best of me. With that said, I won’t begin with talking about how much this frustrated me. I will talk about just the facts first.1. When I had this strapped to my head, I had no clue if it’s actually recording. Times I thought it was, it wasn’t. Times I thought it wasn’t recording, it was. So I wore out both batteries on an adventure today, missing all of the important things I actually wanted to record.",1,1,2019-5-14,1,9,0
"I bought this camera based on all the positive reviews, the whole reason I got it was to get video during a skydive I was doing with my 81 year old Grandfather for his first jump. the short videos I took before the jump were saved on the card. I started recording when we were on the plane about to jump, made sure I got video of everything I wanted to. When I hit the ground I found that the video had frozen at 5:51,  I figured at least we got the jump and the freefall, but to my horror when I checked the camera and SD card later the video was not there at all. Don't trust your once in a lifetime videos to this piece of junk. Wish I hadn't believed all the BS reviews.I'll be getting a real GoPro for my next jump.",1,1,2017-9-24,1,1,0
"At first I was pretty skeptical reading certain reviews.

"I stand by my original complaints, but rating has moved from two-star to four-star because of the vendor standing behind the product. My first unit worked for a very short time I think the length was under three minutes. It finally froze. The vendor provided pre-paid UPS label with the RMA online, and shipped a replacement unit prior to me returning it. This took 14 days of a 30 day return policy. I was asked several times to update my review, and I kept adding paragraphs. I felt like fake 5-star reviews where bought for this very cheap camera.I am going to delete those paragraphs now, as it boils down to, as of today, 8/16/18, the camera is great for 64 bucks, vs. 6.71 times that for a new GoPro6 black...I guarantee you, the GoPro isn't worth the up-charge for any reason other than you want almost double everything... if these resolutions work for the intended purpose. this is a great little camera. Almost no reason not to to give it a five-star, except on principle. Nothing is really five-star, or if everything is five-star, five-star means nothing.",4,1,2018-8-3,1,9,1
"I really liked this camera.  It took some getting used to, but we used it for skiing and snowboarding and in my opinion the camera quality was great!  The sound however was lost a bit, maybe being in the case, but it was always scratching, unless we were not moving.  We took it to a creek across the street and got some great under water video of crawfish, minnows and other under water creatures.  Again the sound does not come out the best, but the under water video and pictures were great.  This is about 6 months into owning the camera, the new had our first issue with it not turning on.  I went online and found some information, and was able to get it to reset.  We took it on a trip to do some cliff jumping, and it worked great again.  The camera did not malfunction and we got some great out of, under and in water camera views, sound not that great, but camera quality was awesome.  We did have some fogging issues since the camera runs hot and the weather was drastically different in the water and in the snow, but we pushed through those small issues.  Then the small piece holding the battery in, cracked, so it was a pain to get the battery in and out.  And at about month 9, the camera would no longer turn on and I could not get it to reset.  For the money I paid, I think we got our monies worth, but would have preferred to have it last a bit longer.  I will most likely buy another one for the price and see how it works, since two at regular price is still cheaper than some others for 1.  All in all, I liked the camera.",3,1,2018-12-28,1,8,0
I never listen to negative reviews if its possible a lemon situation. But my camera also had the battery issue many other complained about.

"ordered this thinking it would be a good deal 4k for under 100 bucks. but it is actually a semi cheap pos for the price the 4k is not true 4k it is sketchy and misses frames in 4k mode with terrible picture quality and overly saturated and fuzzy colors. the batteries last about 5 minutes recording in 4k and about 10-15 in 1080 it comes with a bunch of worthless accessories and the waterproof case is made of cheap plastic that looks only good enough for something this disposable. not a good buy as well there is no option for an external mike so in the case all you hear is muffled noise. they include a card for a ""free gift"" of an sd card or 2 more batteries if you leave a positive review. i saw those reviews and thats what decided me guess i was wrong. in short this is a scam to sell a cheap knock off cam to gullible people. do not buy this you can find them on ebay for 20 bucks..",1,1,2019-7-16,1,5,0
"I bought this as an inexpensive camera to take on an upcoming diving trip.  I have not had a chance to test it underwater and will update my review after my trip.  (BTW I bought the VVHOOY underwater camera case for it because it include a red filters that I do not have for my other cameras.  The camera fits nicely in the case, I probably won't know if it is waterproof until it is too late.  )I read the complaints about the manual and yes the print is small and I had to use a magnifying glass to read it.  But I could read it and the instructions were clear. The part that was a little unclear is how to connect to an iPhone using iSmart DV or as other have recommended PNJ iCam.",4,1,2018-1-20,1,7,0
"This camera was far worse than expected. And I really didn't expect that much considering it was a knock-off Go-Pro for $60. But I really don't believe it is worth $60, and I regret spending that much money on a camera that I will never use again. The image quality is that of my first RAZR flip phone from 14 years ago...except I'm pretty certain my flip phone took less grainy pictures. Moisture definitely made its way inside of the case. The camera puts a time stamp on every photo, which is annoying, and then the timestamp is incorrect because it resets EVERY TIME you change the battery. Our images and videos were blurred due to the moisture that made its way in front of the lens. Video quality is NOT 4K, and that is a complete lie. Shame on Amazon for listing this as a #1 recommended product. We opened it and played around with it before our vacation to Hawaii; it wasn't the best, but we felt that based on the Amazon reviews (which I later found out were given in exchange for some additional free products), we would be happy with it on the trip. We were really sad that we trusted vacation memories of our snorkeling adventures to this awful camera. Sadly, my return window closed while we were in Hawaii, so I was unable to return it. I am now stuck with a poor quality camera with technology from 2006 and out $60. :(Edit: Customer Service reached out and refunded me, which was pretty awesome.

"I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The ""water proof"" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the ""good stuff"". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary ""action"" video but nothing to write home about.",3,1,2019-8-3,1,5,0
"I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it’s only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can’t be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don’t mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand",3,1,2018-3-19,1,4,0
"Whatever you do, DON'T use the suggested app for this camera EK7000. It hardly works. Once you do get it running it constantly shuts down. I downloaded the app called iSmart DV and it seems to be working. I bought this to use for taking hard to reach shots of action figures, and I'm sure I'll be able to get this camera into spots that I need it. But the picture quality doesn't seem like it's 12mp like the box says. But what did I expect for $50. I'll probably use this until I can get a better camera.Just please, save yourself some frustration and download the iSmart DV app. And I hope it works for you.",2,1,2020-4-2,1,1,0
"I'm using this as a helmet camera on my motorcycle. The image quality is decent enough, and it has a good field of view.I was looking for some sort of camera to stick on my helmet. It comes with plenty of adapters and mounting options in the box. They're all decent, but noticeably inferior to GoPro brand adapters. But they're free, so whatever. It comes with two cases, which you have to use if you want to mount it to anything. The sound quality upon playback is extremely quiet, and there's no way that I can find for an external mic to be connected. If there were, I'd rate this 5 stars. The image quality overall is great for a $50 gopro knockoff. No complaints there at all.",4,1,2020-4-11,1,1,0

It was clearly the best of over 100 other participants.So, not really a review, but after my initial experience with this particular use, I strongly recommend this product. In time I will try out all the other features and possibly revisit this review.

"You get what you pay for in this case. I actually really like it. It takes really nice photos, and is waterproof (I tested it for an hour playing around in about 5 feet of water in a lake). I have two major complaints though.1.) The app is absolutely horrible. I had to google how to connect it to my internet, which may just be me honestly, but once I got it all set up with the app it only runs for about a couple minutes before it crashes and shuts the app down. You can’t save or delete more than one photo at a time or it crashes the app as well. It makes it kind of a huge pain.",3,1,2019-7-15,1,1,0

"AKASO EK7000 Camera froze about 1/3rd of the time even after trying 2 different SD cards and re-formatting it. Many reviews stated they had freezing issues as well. After Akaso support asked me to do firmware upgrade, the unit died and it never powered on. Then they asked me to pay to have it shipped to East coast and then additionally pay $22 for replacment unit. Rediculous. Thankfully I'm able to return it via Amazon since it was still within eligible return date. In addition to Amazon free return, I could have had new replacement sent for no cost but chose not to because they have the worst support ever and thus will never buy their product again.",1,1,2018-12-21,1,4,0
"I bought this camera for someone who is not a techie and had no prior vlogging or making action videos.  I did have to help them use the QR code included with the device and download the PDF manual for them.  But afterward, this person was able to quickly get setup within 30 mins, on their own.They said they really liked the simple and lightweight nature of the design and even could simply strap it to the their wrist while walking.  The menu is relatively intuitive, using a combination of the 4 buttons (front, top, up, & down), but for more granular settings, have to figure things out through some simple trial and error.",3,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"Maybe I got a bad unit, but it records sound so low as to be practically non-existent.  I had to increase the volume to max on my PC speakers to barely hear any audio (yes, I checked it on multiple PCs).  I also checked it both in and out of the case - still, barely-there audio.  It's a shame because the video is bright, sharp, and vibrant.  Also, comes with a great collection of mounts.  However, the 'clips' were VERY loose in an actual GoPro mount; though they were tight in the included mounts.  I was looking forward to using this on the slopes, but no audio is a no-go - back it goes.  If you want this just for video - this is a great choice.  Oh, it records in .mov format - didn't see that listed anywhere else.",1,1,2019-3-5,1,5,0
The description states there is a user manual inside. It's actually listed a few times. There isn't a user manual. There a picture book to set it up which doesn't help.

"The short version is;  the camera is almost non functional - constantly freezing up, crashing, requiring battery removal (thus resetting the time and date and all your preferences).The packaging is fantastic and rivals the name brand cameras.  The camera itself is well built, the waterproof case is great and it comes with a ton of accessories.  The interface is surprisingly intuitive for a knock-off and reasonably well thought out. I popped in a brand new 64GB SD card, formatted it, and began shooting beautiful video and great photos.  After probably 30 minutes of run time, the camera began to demonstrate why it's only $75.  During filming, the camera locked up and the display showed a bunch of vertical green lines and was unresponsive to any combination of button presses.  The only way to recover was to take the battery out.  I swapped out the first battery for the fully charged 2nd battery, and within 5 minutes the display showed LOW BATTERY! and shut down.  The battery indicator, however, showed a full battery.  I tried 3 different SD cards, both batteries, and operating indoors with the protective case off.  Same result.  I could snap a few photos, maybe take 30 seconds worth of video, then it would lock up.",1,1,2017-8-14,1,7,0
"OK - so an update to my original review.  One of the things I was most interested to use this for was streaming.  I have an ATEM mini and all cameras connect in via HDMI.  There are two ports on the side of this device: USB and HDMI (both micro) - neither allow me to achieve the function of using this as a webcam/streaming.  There IS some way to use their app on a smartphone, but I want to use the camera like real hardware...not a toy.Frankly, this is quite disappointing and although all my thoughts below still stand (as a stand alone sports camera it's quite good) I have to change my review because frankly this doesn't do what I asked if it did...which is stream live as a webcam.",2,1,2020-5-7,1,2,0

"Purchased two of these units by mistake, but was glad I did since one had intermittent LCD issues (possible battery connection) and was returned.The picture quality and ease of use is good, but unfortunately it lacks a good instruction manual.  You get a variety of different mounts, but you do have to look at them carefully in order to be able to identify them and make them useful. Due to the nature of Action Camera Mounts, you may have to use several different mounts joined together to make one that will fit your needs. If you have not yet purchased the camera, don't feel that you need to order a set of additional mounts, wait till you get it and see if what you get will work for you.  If you don't have a Selfie-Stick you might consider ordering one and if you plan on using the camera with the included underwater housing, you might consider ordering an underwater holder/floater.",4,1,2017-9-4,1,4,0

"I am still in shock how good this camera works. I have been a pro photographer for over 40 years and have been with the mistaken idea that size matters. Well I can say that when it comes to cameras this is not true. I ordered the Akaso Cameras to record biking, hiking, working, and did not want to spend a small fortune on a camera that I strapped to my Bicycling helmet understanding that it may come off and be broken this first few times I went out for lengthy rides. I was absolutely wrong. I was so wrong that I had to write this review to tell the world just how good and easy this camera is to use and view. First the camera comse with a comprehensive kit that will cover anything you may want to mount the camera on. From the Bike to the Helmet to the dog, and well anything. Extra mounting hardware makes this doable for multiple helmets and gear. When I opened that package I could not focus on all of the hardware at one time. It was overwhelming. But easy to figure out. Extra straps, extra mounting screws, and even a mount that allows you to place the camera 90 degrees across the handle bars. It is amazing how much thought went into the design of the hardware and the amount of hardware you get. You need nothing else, literally, after the purchase of the unit. I bought 3 thinking I would have to mix and match to get all the mounting I needed. Of course I was wrong, and wound up giving one to the wife and daughter.Picture quality and the available settings are really a sight to behold. Lot of variance for different conditions, super wide-angle lens, waterproof case with an extra back, and several different selections for shooting movies, stills, burst stills, and time lapse. I have not used the time lapse yet but I have several ideas that I will try soon. Overall, I am very happy to have made this choice, I have a lot to do to experiment with the different settings and types of shooting methods. As of this writing I have mounted to camera to the top of my Bike Helmet and will be using it on several different bicycling locations and will be posting the videos on my sites. I have every bit of confidence that this will be a life altering experience for me and at my age I feel very fortunate to have been able to experience this amazing technology. I was very excited to have been able to make use of the digital Photography in my Business, which made photography an even more interesting medium to create and experiment.",5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0

"**** Update - Customer support offered a refund due to the loss of the camera, however that was not necessary.My camera was found on the roadway by another rider later in the day and a week later it was returned to me UNDAMAGED and in good working order.  I am now using a metal mount for the camera and the waterproof case which seems to be more durable. *******  The camera takes very good snaps and video.  I'm an IT guy, but figuring out the features based on the icons displayed was a bit of a challenge.  I mounted the camera to my road bike handlebar and made a few trial runs to make sure my next big ride would be trouble free.  Today I did the Tour of Napa 100k event.  Some of the route roads were choppy with periodic potholes.  I was on a choppy downhill doing about 35mph and the camera mount snapped off due to vibration, and the camera bounced down the highway.  Needless to say, it was not possible for me to safely stop and go looking for it as it was during a 1500 cyclist event, and at 35 mph downhill it would have taken some hard braking and then backtracking into oncoming vehicle and cyclist traffic.  I had previously zip-tied the camera into the mounting frame because the design just clipped the camera into the front-loading frame, with nothing other than a small plastic pressure clip to hold it in place - quite useless.  Even tho the mounting kit that came with the camera had many ways to attach to helmets, handlebars, bike frames, etc., all of them were made of brittle plastic. Quite a bummer to not only lose the camera, but the 64gb SD card (separate purchase), and more importantly, the record of the ride.  Haven't decided to replace or not.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0

"well, we all prolly gonna fall for this cam because of its picture quality and lots of good reviews but after getting this cam, they try to give u some free stuffs if u leave a good review which is totally a scam right there as the reviews should be real, not something u wanna buy off.. nways, i turned on the cam, it looked good and allright but then, this freakin screen went into sleep mode which i understand as most of the cams do  it to save the battery but atleast the screen comes back when u push any button but NO, this cam is all black and blank and never wakes up, and gets so hot after like only 5 mins of recording.. since i used my credit card points to buy this, i am going to replace it and give it one more shot. i will leave the next review when i get the replacement.",1,1,2018-12-1,1,4,0
"This seems like a pretty decent camera, though its no GoPro for the price you really can't beat it, so I bought 2 of them to give one to a friend.  I've had it a couple days now and have been using it on my bike rides to test it out, the real test will come next week when I head out to Colorado to do some skiing.First thing is this camera comes with a ton of accessory mounts and a remote control to start and stop video and take photos.  Give yourself a good hour to unpack it and to get use to how to access the menu to set up the camera and charge the batteries.  The one thing Im not really happy about is that it comes with a real vague start up guide and you have to download the user manual online.  I know most manufacturers do this now, but there seems to be about 3 or 4 different manuals for the EK7000 out there, so make sure you fine the correct one.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,1
"My K9 partner and I area Search and recovery unit/team. We spend many hours on all sorts of terrain and weather conditions from mild to extreme. As volunteers we have to buy what we can afford and it gets expensive considering the extras you need to keep going until you ""find"" what you're looking for. A critical part of that equipment is having a solid compact, camera that can handle everything mentioned above.Surprisingly, this thing is a lil beast! and has weathered the storms pretty well. The Camera comes with a healthy compliment of necessities. With 2 batteries, short charging times, and ability to charge via a usb cord, life becomes easy and welcomed.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"The overall value seems to be there. That is evaluating the quality, against the price. The fact that it has some decent accessories included is good too, those can cost hundreds themselves.The support app for the camera is decent as well.",4,1,2018-12-19,1,2,0
"I ride mountain bikes. I can't afford the gopro so I tried this little camera out. Mounted perfect to my helmet. Took decent video at 1080P... nothing but wind noise. Solution? Cur a piece of foam and tape it over the mic, leaving room for the sound holes of the microphone. Battery life at 1080P is about 40 minutes, maybe 42. Take an extra battery with you. I was told by a riding buddy that it records 2+ hours in 720P. Gonna try that out on next video.Keep in mind this is not for anything other than hobbyist/weekend warrior type stuff. If you want that kind of quality, don't expect it out of a $50 action camera.",4,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"This is my Updated Review of sport camera AKASO EK7000, I have received my replacement from costumer service representative from the company at least I can say they are very helpful in working with you so I choose to give them a second chance the camera so far is working ran both batteries in full charge, The max it will hold is 1hr 30min the picture quality still ok its not a Canon 80d camera so don't expect much there is a little noise in picture quality the video is not true 4K if this is the reason for buying the camera, It does record video with decent video image but not 4K. The camera at its price is great but accident's will happen so if it does happen it wont hurt much if it breaks or if you loose it in the lake, They do have floating hand grip for it to prevent from sinking in lake you just have to buy it. From buying a $300 sports camera I rather pay $60 bucks that will almost do the same as other competitors instead don't you think anyway ending this review with do some research check your wallet !!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,1
"I bought this for our cruise trip which included snorkeling and zipline. I didn't want to risk my cellphone for the video during those activities, and didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars for something I may not use again.The product came with a large box of mounting gears. At first glance it was almost overwhelming, but I was able to find YouTube videos explaining the use of them, and I got them all sorted out and ready for the trip.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"I bought this for a recent trip to Hawaii. I thought I would try it for the price. I was highly impressed with almost every aspect. I used it for still and video. I took it snorkeling several times and the video turned out amazing! The only flaw I came across was, 2 days in, the self-timer stopped working. It hasn't worked since, either. It freezes up if I try to take a timed photo, forcing me to have to turn it off. Other than that, it's a great buy!",4,1,2019-6-13,1,3,0
**Update**I was contacted by their customer support and they sent me out the pro version which has Image stabilization and is 4k. It also has a webcam function that I have been using for board games online ans it's wide lens captures a lot of the board. The image quality is great too. I was really surprised with their support-,5,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"I have mixed feelings about this camera.  It has a lot of nice features and came with a lot of accessories.  I think for action video in bright light, it works really well.  In low light or underwater in more than 10 feet of depth, the pictures are poor.  I took it with me diving in about 30 feet of water and the video/pictures are horrible.  I was pleased that the housing didn't leak, so that's a bonus.  In fact, someone else on the trip had a real GoPro Hero and their housing allowed the pressure to push in button so they couldn't change shooting modes.  My housing allowed me to use all the functions.  But look at the underwater picture. They are all useless, even with post processing to add a red filter.  Above water, they were great.  Not sure if mine is defective.",3,1,2017-11-21,1,4,1
"I bought this for my nephew who is 12. I have a gopro hero 7 black and he loves using my gopro he is just rougher than i like on the camera after watching his footage. The day it arrived I set it up for him it recorded and everything worked fast forward to yesterday Memorial day we went out to the springs and when the record button is pushed the camera either locked up or lines ran across the screen and didn't record. I formatted the card in the camera and that is when this started, I put the card in un-formatted the night it arrived it recorded without any issues. Here is what I found I bought him a class 10 U3 64gb Samsung card with 100mb/s write speed the card is good for 4k I checked it against fakes it's a legit Samsung sd card. If you press record and your Akaso Ek7000 freezes or throws lines across the screen back down the resolution what we found worked was 1080p 30 frames anything higher and the camera freaked out. To format the card or change reolution once powered on press the mode button until the wrench is displayed then press the top record button. Once inside settings the mode button exits and the record button is enter the side buttons scroll. with Resolution highlighted press the record button set it to 1080/30 then press mode button to exit out of settings. The app I can't get to work on an iPhone 8+ or a Samsung S8+ i only connected successfully once it froze.I could return the camera but recording in 1080/30 will be fine for a 12yo it takes photos just fine this is a test to see if he will take care of it then I will get him an official GoPro. My nephews love the springs and they film fish, turtles and back flips off the dock with my gopro but now they have their own to use and my GoPro is no longer bounced off the bottom or banging against the rails climbing up the dock. Hopefully this helps someone i couldn't find anything on a freezing or lines across the screen for the Akaso brand.",3,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"My hopes were high that this camera would work based on the good reviews -- reason why I purchased this camera.This camera was intended for our vacation in the Philippines for 3 weeks last month. The capabilities of this camera was very disappointing. The screen freezes several times when used after only about 2 minutes of filming. After 2 minutes of filming, a red screen would appear and then the camera freezes. I was very disappointed that I missed capturing all the water activities we did during our vacation.",5,1,2019-8-3,1,1,0
"I was amazed at the quality of the picture and the bundle of accessories that made it usable for different purposes.  I bought it for myself, but also mainly for my two granddaughters (9 and 12) to use to make underwater videos in their pool. They had a great time making videos of each other and also telling stories with the camera in the water. I saw, but don't have, some of their products.  I was quite impressed.  Great quality, easy to learn and use. I also ""borrowed"" the camera to take some shots of my Border Collie running agility courses. She wore the camera with no complaints and the result is some great ""dog's eye"" view of agility. It is fun to watch and great for learning how to direct her in the best ways.  The steadiness of the shots is remarkable. This is just overall a fantastic camera for the price.  I haven't used a Go Pro (at 3 times the price of this one), but I can't imagine that I would be 3 times happier with the results.  Sorry I don;t have samples to post, but I will do so and you can see for yourself.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
I rarely write reviews but reviews are soo different than reality.Here's the real deal.,1,1,2019-8-16,1,1,0
"This is my first action camera and I am also not a video wiz. It proved to be extremely useful to me and my non-profit - I am tying it to a post and tape horse riding and then, I edit the footage in Camptasia. Battery lasts for 1.5 hrs. Angle is wide enough to cover maybe 140 of the ring safely. Close-ups are simply wonderful. I like that I have 2 buttons to contend with. Audio is a bust but I don't really need it.  I don't use any remote features or live streaming. So, I give it 5 for video for this price, for sturdiness in the case and usefulness (it paid off many times).  Four stars  are for minor stuff - cover latch for battery broke quickly and I am taping over it to keep it more secure. Most of the fastening accessories are not very useful. I'm stuck with just one for now  - a little platform, which I tie to top of a post. Lots of videos made by this little camera can be seen on facebook page of Lifeline Horse Rescue and Rehabilitation (@lifelinesaveshorses). I am not submitting a video here because all of them are more than 2 min long after editing long footage.",4,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"I am incredibly impressed with the quality of this camera, especially for the price! I have used it several times-the second time on a kayaking trip in icy water. It fell into the water a few times-and nothing happened! The case was very secure and the camera dry.The image quality is great-I really do not understand how a name-brand GoPro could possibly be 10x as good at 10x the price-this is everything I want in a camera! I watched a fair number of YouTube videos filmed by and filmed about this camera and it was a clear choice for me.  I am considering purchasing a second so I can get two views at once of my adventures-for example one on the front of my kayak and one to take stills or watch the shore.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue.",2,1,2017-12-13,1,4,0
"Finally, a camera with 2 plus hours of recording time.I was totally impressed by the quality of the video this camera takes.  The accessories that come with it allow you to use it almost anywhere.  With the 2 batteries that come with it you'll be able to shoot 2+ hours of video.  Be sure to get yourself a high quality Micro SD card, Class 10 with a high write speed.  The menus on this camera are very easy to follow and get you whatever you want.  The included remote is an added extra which works great.  Download the app and you can control this camera with your phone and see what it sees.  Getting the app connected to the phone was straight forward.  Take your time and download the manual and follow the instructions for what you're trying to do.  There is only one thing I worry about with this camera and that is how long will the battery cover/door last with me inserting and removing batteries.  Other than that you will get your  money's worth if you buy this camera.  I am glad I did.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
My husband was so excited about this gift until he reviewed the footage he recorded. It was blurry and not at all High quality picture clarity. It lacked sharpness and definition. It looked awful. Words on pictures and boxes in the video background couldn’t be read. Our cellphone video footage was perfect and much better.  We read all directions and purchased a new high quality as card that supports 4k. Ties didn’t help.  Super disappointed. I am hoping that this is a defective unit and you are safe to buy but I don’t know. It was a Christmas gift and purchased in advance so our return window is closed.,1,1,2019-12-27,1,1,0
"The picture is the same if not BETTER than my friends Hero... Ok... Ive used the Akaso 7000 now long enough to know if you want a really good action camera? Spend the extra and get a GoPro. The Batteries to this Machine are HORRIBLE only lasting maybe 40 minutes at the most! And that's on the lowest 1080 it has... So I carry FOUR batteries when i go out Detecting and 95% of the time Im always using the BlackWeb Charger I purchased only for this reason... The GoPro Hero 4 has a great picture and a nice stabilizer... BUT the biggest of the big are the batteries. ONE single Hero battery will last as long as FOUR Akaso 7000 batteries. So i make lots of cuts in my vids that I have to put together at the end of the day because I try to save each and every second possible! The charger is used as soon as the first two batteries go down. I hook up the BlackWeb to the two DEAD batteries charger and start them up. Lots to carry around with the Akaso when the GoPro beats it by having the one battery inside. Try going kayaking and taking all that along for the Akaso, including the water case it must be in that you cant hear anything from, and compare it to the single battery, waterproof , GoPro.

The main selling point was, again its price, but also the wireless remote control (included) to take pictures of videos.The kit comes with all sort of attachments so it can be attached to a helmet, windshield mount, selfie stick, tripod, etc.",4,1,2017-3-31,1,5,1

I was excited to see all the items it had, charged the batteries and when I turned it on the damn thing needed a card to work. No problem, I had one. It wouldn't allow me to take any pictures only video. I couldn't see the screen too good so I went to hook it up on wifi like to see the video through my smart phone like I saw in a YouTube review and it wouldn't connect. The camera says I was connected but the app kept giving me error messages. I tried everything. By then I was already aggravated as all the positive reviews had me thinking I was getting a bang for my buck. I shouldn't have to climb over mountains to get an item to work.

"This was given to me as a present for my birthday.  I was surprised that it came with 2 batteries and a lot of nice accessories.  I primarily use it to record when I go out bashing with my RC car.  Was amazed with the quality and crispness of the pictures.  I think it is pretty durable too. I’ve hit it at speed with my RC and it didn’t skip a beat.  I did have it inside the waterproof case it comes with at the time.  Battery life is ok.  But you get two so no complaints.  I never attempted to use the app  that comes with it so I can’t speak to that.  It’s really nice having a remote that comes with it.  Kind of wish it had a light to tell you what button you pushed (did I just stop the recording or did I just push start?).  At $49 per, I think this is a steal and will definitely get another one.

If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control.

"I use this camera in its waterproof case on my kayak while fishing. It's mounted with a Scotty mount on an extension pole. The camera was a little challenging to figure out at first, but not too bad. The battery is only good for about one hour, but it does come with a spare battery. I like that you can swap out batteries instead of having a sealed battery requiring recharging with a cord to the camera. I use the remote (put it in a ziplock bag) to activate the record mode while on the water. I have a great video that was shot with this camera of a battle with a huge Crevalle Jack.Recording time was about 35 minutes. The camera worked great, and the video converted nicely to be viewed on my large screen tv. The camera while in the waterproof case is pretty tough too. On a different day I got a little careless and allowed my kayak to roll in the surf along the beach. The Scotty camera mount broke, and the camera went into the surf along with much of my other gear. I recovered the camera and later washed the sand and salt off it. it was just fine. New Scotty mount, and we're off and running again.I can afford a Go Pro, but I just can't see spending that kind of money. This camera works fine for me.",4,1,2017-11-15,1,1,0

I ran into trouble while trying to access Setup mode. Press the mode button and it cycles through different options. Only thing mine would only cycle once or twice and then stop. I never could get to Setup mode so I am unable to set my camera to the operating options I want. Not good. So, since I took so long to start using the camera I am now past the return window. I liked what I saw when it did what I wanted it to do, but not being able to set it up like I want stinks. So, will be putting this in a box on a shelf and chalk it up to lesson learned.

The image stabilization works about as good as your eyes do when you’ve had 10 shots and 6 mixed drinks and you’re laying down in your bed, staring at the ceiling. Image quality is so-so but the fact that any sort of movement makes the video shaky just renders this camera useless to take video of any good times you want memories of. Literally any newer smartphone camera takes better quality pictures and videos than this. I have an iPhone 8 and it’s twice as good and way more convenient than this.Enough about the poor quality videos this takes, let’s move on to the terrible features and few good qualities this camera has: good ones first.",2,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0

It is durable and has great quality pictures and video.  I was surprised by the number of attachments that he could use on a helmet or mask or stick or bike.  You name it and it was included. It even came with an SD card adapter! You can't really hear the recording when you are using playback. However, when we put the memory card into the computer it was much better.  You have to talk loudly if you want it to record the voices, but we have always had ours in the waterproof housing.  He LOVES the wrist band remote. You do have to be pretty close to the camera for it to work.  Overall, we are very impressed and would definitely buy this brand of camera again.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

I shot my video while on vacation in Florida, 1 PM on the ocean goofing around with my wife, I attached the action cam to my full face mask and started filming away, when I saw the quality of the images afterwards I was blown away, I guess 12 megapixels will bring you some pretty top-notch quality video!  I want to say that if you want professional grade video, by the go Pro or Osmo, but quite frankly the video on this action cam is pretty damn good and I can’t justify spending $300+ on anything else. I will try to upload  a video with the next couple days.

"My wife said she wants evidence of how I was killed on my motorcycle, my fault or theirs, so she gave me permission to buy an action camera. I have it mounted on my helmet and I've used it twice now on my commute and as seen in the pic, condensation has formed INSIDE the ""waterproof"" case. The only times I've open the case was to change batteries. I was in a dry environment when I did this (my living room) yet somehow moisture has found it's way inside.4K: The 4K setting only runs at 25FPS (frames per second). I'm not even sure it's a true 4k, the video was pixelated and the quality of the 1080p 60FPS setting looks much better. Seems they added the atrocious 25FPS 4k just to be able to advertise that it's a 4k camera.

"This camera actually takes pretty good footage when its recording... if you stand behind the mounted camera or hold the camera to operate it works nice. the controls are just a little too clunky for a sports action camera in my opinion. I have tried multiple times to self film some bow hunts and if you cant see the camera recording just assume it is not. I should have gotten some really good footage but didn't. If you are able to look at your camera and operate the controls and verify recording then you should probably just use your phone. If you want to mount this behind you to film a hunt or put on your helmet for some type of riding or whatever, you will have no clue what the camera is doing.Also the battery life is VERY short...

"Unfortunately I am disappointed in this. I should have known better then to expect anything for what this cost.  There’s a reason GoPro costs More.  I bought this specifically to go scuba diving on vacation.  I found that it did not record any of the underwater footage, even though the red light was on and there was 5+ hours left of record space.  I then went back and saw that about 1/5 times I thought I was recording it actually wasn’t recording.  I tested this and found that if I record video for more than 30 seconds, it almost never saves it.  And it frequently won’t save any video files at all regardless of length.  Photos are the same. Sometimes it saves them, sometimes it doesn’t.  If you want to make sure you actually get your footage, don’t buy this.  Maybe a good toy for your toddler.  Disappointed that I won’t ever be able to share my experience.",1,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0

Battery life is on par with every other action camera I've owned.Note: if you're going to use the remote to stop/start and there is more than 30-60 seconds that recording is paused, you probably want to turn off the power saving feature that shuts off the camera if it's not used for a while.

I got this for my husband and our children to record their fishing trips.  The picture quality is okay but the audio is absolutely horrible.  If my husband holds the camera at arm's length to record himself you can hear enough to know that he is speaking but you can't understand anything.  If he wears the camera on his chest you can understand some of what he says but it is very quiet.  It is so quiet that even after enhancing the video's audio in filmora you still have to strain to make out what he says.Update:  The seller took it upon themselves to reach out to me and asked how they could help me to improve my experience.  They worked with me to make the situation better and I was very impressed by that.,3,1,2019-8-6,1,1,0
Was very sad with purchase. Unable to download to laptop or computer.We purchased for a 2 month trip across country. FL TO CA. Wanted to use as a action camera 📷 🎥 as well as dash cam. Was unable to get the pics on second cam download and 1st wouldn’t stay on. Very disappointed. Ended up using phone and video camera 📹 which didn’t work well on dash.  WANTED JUST TO GET VIDEO CROSS-COUNTRY total of 7000 miles,2,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"The following review is from my son, who purchased this camera to mount on his quadcopter.========================",5,1,2018-1-21,1,1,0
"My eight-year-old has been begging for a Go Pro for a while now, so I started looking into more affordable options that would still produce good results and settled on the AKASO EK7000. I can't speak on whether the camera can in fact handle up to 100 feet underwater, but my son has done several long and thorough tests in the bathtub and in the sink and it works flawlessly. Video and picture quality are great, especially for this price point! The sound quality may not be the absolute best, but it's decent and is plenty good enough for what my son uses it for (note: when the case is on, it doesn't pick up sound well at all, though I don't think it was intended to since the case is what makes it waterproof and all). He mainly wanted it for when he does parkour (he's learning) and to mount onto his skateboard. My son was able to navigate through the menus mostly by himself once I showed him how (I had no trouble with the settings/menu at all). He filled up the 32gb card I bought for it in a couple of hours lol and has been using it constantly, so I LOVE that this camera came with two batteries and a dual charger that lets you charge them at the same time. Now he'll always have a battery ready. It also comes with a ton of mounts (except head and chest) and a little wrist remote, which I suspect will come in especially handy once he gets the hang of using it. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this little camera and my son absolutely loves it!",5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
Update!! This company has won a customer! A customer support tech reached out to me and provided amazing support. This company stands by their products! They got me setup again. I will be more careful and I will definitely look to this company first for my next action camera!!-original review-,5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,1
"Cheaply made camera, all the accessories don't offset how plastic and hollow this camera felt. The video quality was acceptable, the audio was poor and the lack of a touchscreen and very dim display had me return this camera. There are a lot of options at this price point and Akaso( a no name brand) should not be charging this much for such a low grade camera. The waterproof case uses a plastic lens on all their cameras which is prone to getting scratches on it.Update:",3,1,2019-8-9,1,1,0

"<Update 7/15/19:  The video I uploaded as part of this review looks nothing like the video I took with the camera. I'm not sure what happened to it, but it obviously doesn't give a very good testimonial for the camera. Hoping this is some sort of temporary issue>After my son lost his expensive GoPro last year in Costa Rica, I said it was too risky to buy another one. But my wife and I were going to Belize and knew it would be a mistake not to have some kind of underwater camera for the awesome snorkeling, so I started doing some research. Came across this camera, and given the price and good reviews figured it would be worth giving it a shot.  There were a couple downsides which are noted below, but overall it was a great purchase.",5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,1
"I will start off by saying I‘ve never owned a GoPro. This is my first ever action cam and we actually bought it to get extra camera angles and top-downs for our video work.We love this camera!  All the attachments had me confused at first but I found a use for every single one.  I was pretty happy with what I got for the first two days, but the camera got 10x BETTER and more fun for me and the kids to use once we installed the phone app and could control and view the camera output from our phones. Super cool camera and for the price, it’s hard to complain much IMO.",4,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"I ordered this camera after trying to use my phone camera on vacation in a water proof case under water. The phone did not work. So I came home and ordered this camera after doing some research. I have NOT used this camera under water yet. I have tested the camera in the waterproof case in the sink full of water and the case works great. So I cannot advise on how clear the pictures are under water yet.What I can review is the ease of use and the accessories that it came with. I was very impressed. This is the first digital camera I have owned though. I have never owned a Go-Pro. But for the value of this camera, I think the picture is great, the ease of use is great and the accessories that it came with are good. I only really needed the waterproof case. It has a remote that you can put on your wrist and that is really cool and works really well.",4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,1
"Bought this camera for my honeymoon. We traveled cross country visiting 16 different states. The camera works great and takes great pictures. Especially under water. The only thing that you need to make sure of, is when you’re taking pictures, make sure the lenses are wiped clean otherwise you will have blurry pictures. I keep my camera in the water proof case and have had some blurry pics due to dirty lenses. Otherwise great camera for the price!Updated to add the 5th star! The customer service was excellent!! Highly recommend this camera!",5,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0

"I purchased this on the basis it was a 4K high res camera however in the “settings” option page it only allows the choice of 720 60fps or 1080 30fps. Not at all as advertised, in fact the very name of the camera 4K HD PRO is just blatantly misleading.Maybe I just got a bad one but will find out as I like the other features and affordability of the camera itself. It comes with a wealth of attachment hardware which is nice.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I took this out for its first use on motorcycle, and am pleasantly surprised how stable the image is. It was mounted to the top of my clutch reservoir. I was expecting blurry or vibration filled clips, but it looked very good.The problem I had was with the clamp mount. When I began to install this mount, the first nut fell free  and hid.  Be aware of this.  This was also the only piece that did not have semi-captive acorn nuts for the thumbscrews. After finding the nut, I tightened the bracket onto the handlebars and left it to fetch the camera. By the time I returned, the mount had snapped at one of the ends, falling loose. It was not excessively tight, just enough to keep the camera case from moving.  I expect that this could have happened while underway, causing loss or damage to the camera.",4,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0
"This is the first of two Akaso camera's I've recently purchased, and while this one is the lower costing camera,it has been a better camera. I've had some issues with my other camera which I purchased mainly because it has image stabilization, while this camera does not.What I find is that if you are using this as a helmet mounted camera, you don't notice the camera not having image stabilization much, if at all. I find the video image comparable to the more expensive EK7000 PRO as long as it's mounted on something like a motorcycle helmet, which is basically an image stabilizer, but when using it on an RC car, it would be nice to have the image stabilization option.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
I wanted an affordable small camera to take kayaking and hiking. I didn't want to be nervous to loose it. This camera is good quality for a fair price. The app interface is much better then dealing with the buttons on the camera. They take some getting use to when you are trying to navigate the menus. But the app is super easy. Just for video or pics the buttons are not an issue.The bundle has a big variety of options but I am super happy with the waterproof case. I tend to swim a lot when I kayak so i wanted to be sure it wont get ruined. Plus I seem to always get stuck in the rain.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,1
"I bought this for my son to use on a family trip to Yellowstone.  I had previously bought a GoPro Session, which was my only experience with action cameras, but I thought that it would work for a 9-year-old on a somewhat rugged trip.tl;dr:  Given the (tiny) price, it's more than I expected.  If you have serious requirements, buy a serious camera.  If you're looking for a cheap intro to action cameras, give it a try.",5,1,2018-10-15,1,0,0
"I got this camera November of 2017. I have not used it right away since I was not able to get the memory card right away. Then I first used it late December last year to just do a simple recording and photo shoot. The camera was great and by the time I was trying to use the remote control that came with it, I noticed that it is not pairing with the camera. I thought I am just doing something wrong until I made my research. It looks like there is something wrong with either the remote or the camera itself when paired to its remote control. Then I totally got out of luck when the deadline for eligibility to return or replace this item is over. Now I'm stucked with an action camera without a remote control. I cannot find a replacement remote here in Amazon. Please anyone help me find a good working remote control for this camera?I upgraded the review to a 5-star rating not only because of the great product but also to a superb customer service by AKASO. I was not aware that they tried to contact me long time ago since I was not really checking my emails periodically and their email was delivered in my junk mail folder. I am not a pro action camera user but I am very particular gadgets user. I always make sure that the products that are purchasing are within my quality standards and we do not need to pay for an arm and a leg to get what we need to achieve. I do not want to buy a Mercedez Bens if I would only use it for my everyday grocery shopping or driving it to work. My point here is based on the actual photos and videos that I am getting, AKASO EK7000 is perfect. Most of high priced products are just so hyped because of their name brand only. This camera is perfect for me. I will give a full photo and video review once I got a good subject and be able to find sometime roaming during the holidays. To be continued...",5,1,2018-2-15,1,1,0
"I purchased this mainly to film my kids ski and am overall very happy with it.  It is completely waterproof and has a very wide angle view.  The sound is not as loud when in the case but it is still pretty clear as I have video conversations with my kids instructors.  I also used the bike mount and attached the camera to rearview mirror to use as a dash cam when not using for sports.  The cons are the beep is not very loud in the case so when I mount it on my helmet, I can't tell if its recording.  I mount it on my chest now so I can see the  record indicator.  It would been nice for the remote to have an indicator showing the recording has started or stopped.  You can pair with phone through WiFi for status and controls but that is a pain for skiing.  Also, not ideal for being a dash cam because there is no autostart recording on power up.  I have to start it every time I drive.  Also the camera does not charge when in use so the camera will not stay on long after the car is off and power is cut.  The intend purchase is not for dash cam so I did not grade down anything dashcam related.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Needed a camera to record some trail riding with. The value of this 4K action camera is like the quality of its shots: spectacular! I was reluctantly set on buying a GoPro, then I noticed this 4K action camera on Amazon. The reviews were favorable and the amount of accessories included, for the price, was simply too hard to walk away from. So I didn’t, and I’m stoked about it. This 4K action camera hold its own against the masses, for a third of the price. A THIRD OF THE PRICE!! What else needs to be said, except stop wasting your money on GoPro and get an equally quality picture for a better price for a pretty nifty-looking 4K camera.",5,1,2019-10-11,1,1,0
"We use this for Youtube videos and home videos and photos. My 8yr old daughter uses it as her personal video camera for her toys. Comes with so many accessories, many of which you may never need. Camera is very simple, but can be a little awkward to operate since there are not very many buttons. You can (and should) change most of your settings through the APP. Takes decent pictures, but doesn't zoom in and isn't set up for slow-motion type action. Be careful when recording to make sure the button has been pushed and you CONFIRM it is recording (I have lost a few videos thinking it was recording when it wasn't, I know, operator error, but easy to do). If you want a ""go pro"" for a bargain price, try this. Might also be good for a 2nd ""go pro"" that you don't mind putting in risky situations.",4,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
The value for the price is unbeatable so don't get mad at the shortcomings - you get more than what you paid for even if it's not comparable to the high end.For $50 there are a fair amount of accessories that come with this camera and you should have no issue operating it right out of the box. I slapped a pre-charged battery and an SD card into the camera and was recording in minutes. Perfect for someone dipping their toes into the world of live streaming (such as myself). It comes with two batteries (and charger) so you'll have plenty of juice but be sure to grab a 64G or higher SD card and Micro USB cable at checkout because these are not provided.,4,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0
"Took some quick videos to get use to the features and functions.  This camera is easy to use the clarity was amazing.  I used the remote control wristband to start/stop the video.  Nice feature, I wish it were waterproof, I'd use it more often.The waterproof housing works fine, just need to put a thin coat of wax on the lens to keep the water from spotting. I mounted the case to my mouth piece and when I finish my water shot edits will add to review.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0

I haven't checked up any solutions for this, but so far, only one file is able to play. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I assume it was just insert the card and record. It says the files are .mov, but quicktime or vlc won't play them. When I try and playback them on the actual device, it says the files are unable to play and get a green/grey bar across the screen.",1,1,2018-4-26,1,3,0
"This is a great beginner action camera to start with. Nothing fancy, but a great value. I shot a few videos and they look pretty good, not awesome, but the balance between quality and price paid is fair. 4 stars just because it didn't come with sd memory card, I had to spend an extra $20 for a 64gig. I would have paid an extra $10 for the camera all together if it had an SD card. They are pretty cheap on Amazon, I'm sure Akaso guys would afford that. All in all, my son is happy!",4,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
There’s a lot of little attachments in the box but not really any instruction manual to explain how it works.  There are rechargeable batteries for the camera but the remote doesn’t work at all.  To get to the battery on the remote you have to use a tiny screwdriver on 4 screws to open the back then open it up and have to unscrew the circuit board get the battery out to change it.  I don’t happen to have any of these button batteries either.  So that part of the purchase is useless to me.  It’s not a big deal really to me but to someone else it might be.  My son tested it out on his helmet and it has a pretty good picture.  Not very loud audio though.  That might be something we can adjust in the settings though.,3,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0

"Last December, I bought the EK7000. After reading the reviews, I thought it was a great choice for the price. For eight months, it worked like a charm. I used it for three different trips. The video quality was excellent; the sound was great. For the price, it couldn't be beat! Plus, they give you a bunch of accessories. Well, randomly, my screen decided to stop working. I had only used it for a total of twelve days over eight months - broken. After following a troubleshooting website, I attempted to fix it. I bought new batteries and a new SD card. It didn't work. Then, randomly, the screen turned-on again, but now, it's not filming. I am disappointed. If it's not one thing, it's another.Update: After posting this review, AKASO messaged me. They sent me a new camera - free of charge. So far, it's been working like a charm. I used it to film Christmas. I'll use it a few more times before I up my rating. But, I will say that their customer service is on-point. If you do have any issues, they're willing to make it right.",3,1,2019-8-31,1,0,1
"EDITED REVIEW - the company reached out to me after my earlier review and sent me a new camera. I have not had issues with the case or mounts rusting at all after several salt water uses so perhaps it was just a fluke with the first one! However, the handlebar mount snapped in two the first time I was out using it, after it hit my soft foam paddleboard.... I just bought a clamp mount instead. The pictures and video from the camera itself are quite nice. Took me trying out several programs before I found one that would edit the videos. I use Open Shot Video Editor. As in my original review, to use the remote the camera must be OUT of the water. So I start the video by remote instead of reaching up my paddle, swing it around and stick it in the water. It makes for a few seconds of awful video so trimming is a necessity! Overall, it does take good videos and I'm happy with the purchase.Original review - I have an old GoPro but I didn't want to leave it attached to my paddle since it's occasionally left alone by the car as I'm loading/unloading down to the beach. I hoped this camera would be what I needed, something to take good pics/videos yet not such a big investment in case of loss. Unfortunately after just three uses the housing and mounts are very rusted! Three uses in three weeks and it looks like I've owned it for years and treated it horribly. The remote doesn't work the moment that the camera is submerged so do not count on that being something you can do. I had hoped to stick my paddle under the water and snap some pictures but can't. To use the video under water with the remote, you need to start the video above water and then submerge the camera.",4,1,2018-10-25,1,0,1
The camera is absolutely amazing it works perfect. I had an issue ordering a external microphone And gave a bad review on that camera because of the microphone issue. Will the company send me a brand new camera at no cost to me. The customer service is out of this world good. I would’ve been perfectly satisfied if they would’ve sent me a microphone but now they went above and beyond to send me a Updated camera. I was thinking about buying a go pro but hands-down a Akaso customer service is out of this world. I highly recommend buying a V50 pro Or even the EK 7000 Is awesome. I have a YouTube channel and I use both of these cameras. And the awesome thing about if you do have a problem they will send you a replacement camera once you send the other one back. And may I add they will send you the labeling the same the camera back which is awesome. If you’re thinking about buying a budget camera that is a third of the cost of a GoPro butt and save yourself some money. And if you have any problems you just send it back and I’ll send you a new one heck you can’t beat that. God bless Akaso camera company You guys are awesome keep up the good work.,5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"Batteries were LEAKING when I opened this camera.  Also the body of the camera was coming apart at the seams.  Return process was easy though.UPDATE:  AKASO responded to my review and asked if I would give the product another try.  I agreed and I'm extremely pleased that I did.  This camera is very good.  In fact for the price I would say it's a better value and product than an actual GoPro.  I own several of these action cams from different companies and this is definitely my favorite so far.  And the customer service, WOW.  The wifi works great.  It really helps with knowing exactly what your shots are going to look like.  It comes with enough mounts and attachments to really hook to anything.  Waterproof case hasn't failed us yet and it doesn't seem to fog at all. I would love image stabilization but at this price point I really don't expect it.  Thank you AKASO,",5,1,2018-6-1,1,1,0
"The size is prefect for our son who loves to take videos when we are on the go. The waterproof case is also a plus since he loves the pool and amusement parks. Unfortunately we may not be visiting too many of the later yet, but it will get plenty of use at Disney when everything opens. The other thing that I think sets this part is the number of mounts and accessories that it comes with when compared to similar models. It'a also easy to use for our 8 year old who will be the primary user of the camera.We enjoy playing with the Wi-Fi connection and app; that was a lot of fun being able to remotely view, and use the camera/video features. Also allows you to view the photos/video. We're still exploring all the features but have been very pleased so far.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I bought this as a gift for someone who wanted to get into the whole ""GoPro"" filming thing without wanting to spend all the cash right away on a real one. The camera itself is really good for the price as far as image quality and it works just fine with any of the mounting accessories. My only complaint and why it gets a star taken off is the abysmal battery life even when you drop the FPS or quality down. You are lucky to get 30-40 mins of filming on a battery. It took me a while to figure this out as I kept having the camera turn off during long sessions which caused me to lose footage.Overall I'd recommend this camera to play around with before getting something more expensive because its cheap enough that if you break It you can just replace it, however, look into either more or better batteries to take with you if you are going to be filming more then just 1-2 hours at a time",4,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
I bought this on a recommendation from a friend who has one. I was surprised he used an off brand so I really had to look into it. I kept thinking that is ALOT of items included to be so cheap.Everything included helps you start using this right away.  It felt like decent quality and let me say yes it is!  Super easy to use ( I’m not great with tech stuff)  and still only 59.00? Yes!  A lot of great videos out on how to use this.,5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,1
"Edit to update: The customer service is awesome! They contacted me after ready my review. Emailed back and forth a few times and I’m satisfied w/ the outcome.  The picture quality is pretty awesome.I just opened this and I noticed a few things right away. First there are loads of attachments, which is ok but they are each individually bagged. The bags tear easily or already have holes in them, kind of wasteful. Second, the camera out of the waterproof case feels really delicate, some of the attachments don’t work w/ the waterproof case. Third, the cover for the battery is not connected to the camera, it could EASILY get lost. Fourth, you need a tiny screwdriver to open the remote and the initial setup for the remote seems a bit complicated. I’m hopeful that once every thing gets set up it will be easy to use. The camera itself is pretty user friendly so far and the one picture I took of my dog is a quality picture. I’ll edit my review as I get to use it! Fingers crossed👍🏼",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"This gadget works perfectly. I rode my motorcycle through seven torrential thunderstorms and the camera was perfectly dry and operable. I videoed my ride on the Tail of the Dragon at Deals Gap and the video is clear no vibration. Camera controls are easy to use as is the app that you download for it. At $50 why try the others? Because you like the name? Because all your buddies have them? Well all of the GoPro accessories work with this camera. Let your buddies over pay. This camera is the real deal. Battery life while in use is about two hours, but it can also be connected via usb to charge and record while riding. Records in .mov file which I'm told is good. Transfer to PC was easy. I did it without instructions so you can too. I'm trying to learn how to edit them now, but it doesn't look too hard. HINT: The camera also records sound really well.

"Pros:This camera is excellent for the price. I connected it to my bike forks.  I expected the video to be bouncing.  While that camera does not officially support true video stabilization, it does record remarkably stable video. The size and weight is perfect for the application. The camera comes with a half dozen mounting options. It comes with a spare rear cover for the water resistant case. It handles a wide range of lighting without issue. Lens flare is not really a problem.  Distortion at the extreme left and right is not significant.",5,1,2018-7-22,1,0,0
"This is my first ‘action sports camera’. I’ve spent my life doing mountain sports, from being a ‘valley rat’ in Yosemite’s Camp 4 in the ‘60s, ski-instructing for the military in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, to being a climbing instructor for CMS in Estes Park, CO. At 68 years, I thought my days enjoying the mountains were over until my daughter got me out skiing again. I want to record my adventures for my grandchildren to inspire them, and my AKASO EK7000 makes that possible. It’s lightweight, rugged, and easy to use. The camera came bundled with (just about) everything I could imagine needing (need a chest harness for those helmetless backcountry hikes/climbs). The only reason I didn’t give the product 5 stars was because both the  ‘Quick Reference Guide’ and ‘User Manual’ are lacking in detail. However, I did manage to find numerous Google resourced that helped immensely.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,0,1

They capture so many cool things and the clarity it unbelievable. You’d actually think we paid the price of the more “popular” action cameras. With 4 kids, we’ve already decided to get the other 3 their very own. I’m glad I didn’t let the sour reviews deter me away from purchasing this!

This is an awesome camera that comes with some great accessories and you can use a 64 GB card with it (I would also recommend the bundling accessories and a case, you can get all four for under $140 to include the Camera). I used it on our most recent vacation and got some gorgeous pictures and videos! I let my son used it on his bike and he loves watching his video. In addition, they have the best customer service I’ve ever experienced. While I was on vacation with no cell service and minimal WiFi the remote wrist band stopped working and part of my waterproof case crack (I was able to still use the case but kept an eye on it). I contacted amazon using the IM customer service feature (awesome feature if you only have WiFi). They provided me with the email for Akaso customer service. I explained in an email what happened and that I was on vacation. The day I arrived home I had an email asking a couple basic questions. I responded and they sent a new waterproof case and wrist band within two days. They followed up to make sure everything was ok and to make sure I was happy with the results! The earned a customer and fan! I have since recommended this Camera to several friends and family who have purchased it and love it as well. Thank you for the awesome customer service and delivering a great product at the right price!",5,1,2017-11-13,1,1,0
Almost Famous. I'd give it five stars if it worked better. I'd even pay a little more if it worked better. It's just not completely functional without some work around.- Time and Date.  Resets back to firmware date programming when the battery gets changed. Work around for speed is to connect it up via wifi to my phone and open the app.  It syncs the time/date up without getting into the menu.,4,1,2017-11-13,1,2,0
"I bought this camera to record underwater fishing spots and wanted something that was waterproof, not super expensive and I wouldn't be out much money if I lost it. This does the job.  I don't have a Gopro to compare it to, so consider that.Pros:",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"I bought this camera as a gift for my wife after she borrowed a GP from a friend for SCUBA diving, and loved it.  I figured ""for the price, why not?"".  Let me say that this camera does everything you would expect, and is so inexpensive, you could buy 4 of the name brand.  My wife uses it every week to film her dance classes and uploads the video for her subscribers, and it has never once failed her.  The picture and sound is every bit as good, and it saves in the same format as everything else (mp4).  We have never tried the software, because we just use more advanced editing programs, but I assume it works fine.  Before you spend hundreds, try this one first, because you will not be disappointed, and for the price it is easy to replace if destroyed.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I was just learning about go pro but didn't want to spend so much money on something im unfamiliar with. I found this one and so happy about my purchase. Its user friendly and easy to use. The quality is clear and so portable. I haven't tried it in water but we used it in the snow. The case is sealed well and no water have gotten inside. The battery last for 2 hours.  The only thing I wish is the ability to play back the video with the sound. After taking the video and you play it back, there's no sound. Even when you take the waterproof case, you can't hear the sound. But when you download the video in the computer, the sound is clear. Im actually impressed that it records the sound well even though its in a tight water proof case.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"Was really hoping this was going to be great but...it was not. It's easy to use and the case it comes with is water proof, but the video is horrible quality and no where near the 4k that is advertised. Taking it hiking, repelling and just walking were horrible. Once we got back from our trip and looked at the videos and photos all of them were blurry, videos were shakey and very disappointed that our trip was not captured liked we'd hoped.  The pictures literally look as if they are just screen shots of a poor video.  If it's something important, spring for the Go-Pro.",1,1,2019-10-25,1,1,0
"Update 3/29/20: The camera's biggest problem is that it requires constant resetting and the SD card requires constant reformatting. Manifestation of these issues is a camera with inaccessible menus and loss of recording functionality. The solution is simple: remove the SD card from the camera, turn on the camera and reset it (there is a reset function in one of the camera's menus), then reformat the SD card as exfat on a PC (reformatting as exfat on Linux will not restore camera functionality for me for whatever reason). Reinsert the SD card into the camera and you're good to go (until loss of menu access/recording functionality occurs again, which seems to be relative to the SD card being moved from the camera to a different device). I've learned the hard way, always check camera functionality prior to leaving the house.Other than that, when wearing a chest mount  strap and not using the camera's waterproof case, audio is perfect. Video quality at 1080 is certainly at least adequate in both sunny and cloudy weather. New batteries recording at 1080p 30fps will last about 80 minutes.",5,1,2019-5-27,1,0,0
"The very first time I used this camera, the buckle which connects the mount to the camera (in the waterproof casing) unlatched while surfing. the camera fell into the ocean, never to be seen again. I called amazon and explained that my camera didn't even last an hour but they did not provide a refund. I never even got to view any photos. Huge waste of money. I'm gonna give this a NoPro",1,1,2017-10-11,1,6,1
"I have bought several of these over the last few years. The first ones are awesome!! Sharp.. good color balance.. great bang for the buck..Akaso has started making these much more cheaply as time has gone on. The latest ones are not sharp at all, they also have gotten much worse with color balance - the newest ones have an orange/yellow tint to them. Some of the mounts provided don't even fit the cameras now. I have also noticed that over time, the color balance starts to shift slowly, and this makes edit work a pain!!",2,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
I bought this for our Maui trip when we snorkeled. Nothing worse than getting ready to film and the item does not work. It would not accept the 'wifi code' and from there you are left with nothing but a bunch of plastic. Unfortunately the return window closed while on the trip. DO NOT BUY as this is not a reliable item. For me it is $80 down the drain. NOT HAPPY!UPDATE-----------------------------,5,1,2019-8-2,1,1,0
"I just got back from a week in the Caribbean and used this camera for snorkeling, scuba diving and general sightseeing. I admit I didn't use all the options, as I received the camera just a couple days before I left for vacation, but I can't wait to explore what else this little buddy can do!  I found the photos to be of very fine quality, a little pixley underwater for snorkeling, but I am a graphic designer with a trained eye for these things so don't know if the average Joe would notice that. Wouldn't suggest this for scuba diving. This was my first scuba experience and the photos are extremely blue and without color.  I understand that the deeper you go the less color spectrum you will have on camera. Perhaps there is a better camera for photography deeper than 15-20 feet, I don't know. One of my photos (orange coral) was snorkeling and I was about 5 feet below surface. The other photo was at about 15-20 feet scuba diving. The video was snorkeling in Barbados (lots of white sand) on a sunny late afternoon. I was surprised when I downloaded my photos and video that there was a time/date stamp on everything. Perhaps I didn't read the directions well enough, but I hope there is a way to remove that. I also wish that the first option in the cycle of capture options was photo instead of video. Otherwise, I am very pleased with my purchase!",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,1
"My son and his wife worked at a camera shop for over 20 years and they're very impressed with the quality of this little camera, as I am. I'm 74 years old and I'm in love with this. I was pleasantly surprised that in the box beneath the camera itself, there were a whole lot of accessories included with the camera, too. I didn't realize there would be so I ordered a separate accessory package along with the camera so now I have even more accessories. I needn't have bought the extras so I'm including this info in this review so that other customers  know there's a whole box of great accessories also included with the camera at no extra cost. I'm thrilled with this purchase.  Very well worth the money. I give it five stars across the board.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"Update: The customer service team reached out to me to offer a brand new camera after my poor experience. Since I did not request this and they upgraded the camera to a newer and better version, free of charge to me, I'm updating my review to have 5 stars. Call it what you will, but I believe that a review can be based on both the product and customer service of the company. Understand that my previous words should be taken into consideration about this product, but the company went out of their way to make sure I was satisfied with my overall experience. I will see how the new camera holds up compared to the other one and hopefully I won't have a similar issue.The adhesive that attaches the pad to the helmet surface: great. The adhesive that mounts the pad to the plastic mount: Awful. I'm lucky the whole camera system didn't fall off during my commute! This camera is barely worth the $60... I'd spend $40 or so more to get a Yi 2 or something better.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
"I got this camera primarily for snorkeling after my Pentax/Ricoh failed on a recent trip. I researched many cameras until I stumbled on this one. A huge amount of accessories was included. The Go/Pro style mounts seemed to fit my floating handle and other things just fine. Color balance is good , which was always a problem with my Ricoh. Admittedly I have not used it underwater except in an indoor pool due to travel restrictions with the virus emergency. I did think the pool pics were very clear and good quality. It came with two batteries which will be very handy as well. The price is so good I may buy another just to have a spare in case I lose one  in the ocean.",5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
The quality of the camera is truly amazing for it's price. It records professional video footage. The audio is crap but if audio is not your first priority and video is then this is a great camera. I did pick up a memory card that allows me to have 5 hours of video stored on it at any given time. There is another review that someone put on here that says what memory card is best to get for great quality video and I just got one of those and my camera is working great. Looks kind of cheap and is very light but I love it. I picked up the headset/chestset that is sold separately and a tripod and they all work great with my camera. I love the headset with this camera. Smooth video footage.,5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"Got this EK7000 camera for cable wakeboarding...and it worked better than expected. I've never owned a ""GoPro"" because of the scary price, so I was all in to test out this camera at a fraction of the price. I know you can pay more for a camera that has a more stable picture..but I can't really complain about the quality of this camera. I thought the picture was going to be choppy at 4K because playback on the camera itself seems choppy..but when I played it on my computer at home, it was great. I'll be buying more as gifts. I'll update over time if I come across any issues. Also very impressed to see how many different adapter and batteries, accessories it came with. I used the remote too! A+++",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,1
"My 9 year old and I downloaded the instructions and figured it out quickly. The only negatives so far are that the instructions on how to use all the pieces are poor and the fact you can't hear volume when playing back the videos you took on the device stinks. Otherwise the camera has good quality, is pretty simple to use and intuitive with the app. Again wish you could get audio on the actual camera so you don't have to load everything to your phone and then play on another device just to watch playback BUT the camera itself appears to be good quality and it has been really fun having my son explore and make videos all over the place, even in the pool without any problems. I do not have a Go Pro to compare it against though but I still feel this was a good purchase especially for the cost and with all of the supplies provided.Note: I felt they were clear that the SD card was not included but make sure you understand that as well. Also there are a lot of pieces so I'd recommend a case for carrying/storing everything. Final bit of advice would be to purchase a tripod as well as that is not included either (again I knew it wasn't but just found I wanted one after I bought this pack).",4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"The picture quality seems to be good but the camera has few significant limitations:1. The manual says ""in waterproof case audio will not be recorded"", on my motorcycle it was recorded and was too noisy (wind) even on low speed. It's not possible to hear anything else but noise.",1,1,2019-6-4,1,2,0
"I bought this camera to use mainly while Stand Up Paddleboarding and during any other water activities, and it did not disappoint!  The pictures and video quality is perfect, and that along with the affordable prices makes this camera perfect!  It's a little tricky to figure out how to use it at first (changing mounts, connecting it to your phone, etc), but I figured it out in no time and after ""practicing"" a couple times, it became no big deal,  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you download the users manual - it was very handy multiple times while I was learning my camera!  You'll need a QR scanner on your phone, so just fyi!  Make sure you read the directions while connecting your camera to your phone.. again, can be tricky and at first, but once you get it its fine.  Dont let the video quality from the camera fool you - it's choppy and doesn't seem good, and I was SO upset at first, but once you transfer the media to your phone, it's perfect!  I downloaded the recommended Akaso App and also you a video editing app called InShot, and the 2 together work perfectly.  I'm so incredible happy with this camera, and if youre in the market and considering this one, I highly recommend it!(Note, it does get hot quickly so I wouldn't leave it out in the hot sun while not in use.  It comes with 2 batteries, each of which only last about 90 mins, so make sure you have both of them charged and ready to go, and take your charger with you!  I have a portable charger that I used to use for my phone that I carry around with me when Im using my camera.. that way  if both batteries die and we're out somewhere that I don't have access to an outlet, I can just plug them in to that charger!  They reach full charge in no time!)",5,1,2019-7-28,1,1,0
"When I opened the box, which was secured by a single piece of clear tape, the camera was shoved in the bottom with a torn cardboard inner box.  No idea if everything was there, but i needed it for a canoeing trip, so I just went with it.  Camera takes decent pictures and video, but there is a serious flaw.  I did not notice that the camera does not preserve settings if you swap the battery, so all of my media that i took on my trip in 2020 is timestamped January 2018.I was contacted by the manufacturer about this issue, and they promptly shipped me a brand new camera.  I am impressed with the amount of care they have for their customers.  With the instructions included in the NEW camera package they sent, I was able to understand and operate the camera without the 'self-taught' hiccups that I endured with the first shipment that i suspected was not new and may have been a defective return.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"My old GoPro Hero 3+ died after a leak in it's waterproof housing and I started hunting for a new underwater camera. Wasn't ready to drop $400 on a new GoPro 7 after reading some mediocre reviews, so looked for a more budget friendly alternative and I found the perfect choice. The picture and video quality is equal to, if not better, than my old GoPro and it comes with a useful accessories pack. I use it for underwater video primarily and I do miss the blinking red light on the back of the GoPro to show that the video is active. There is a light that blinks on top of the AKASO, so it's just a matter of getting used to it. Easy transfer to my Mac via USB and works well with Mac media apps. All in all, I highly recommend this camera for anyone on a budget looking for a GoPro type action camera.",5,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
"For the price - wow!  I hope this is as good as it seems.  I charged up the batteries, and fired it right up.  I used some of the myriad clamps that come with it to put it different places on my motorcycle.  The connection from the camera to my phone was easy to set-up and makes controlling the camera pretty easy.Somehow I missed the fact that a memory card is not included - so - I've ordered one... and here's the first ""gotcha"" - the instructions says only to use 32GB cards.  I'm a guy, BIGGER IS BETTER - why can't I put 128GB card in this puppy and record entire trips????  So order a 32GB card when you order the camera.  More to come later.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0

I bought this for a photography project where I needed to place a camera in a public area without fear of it being stolen. After testing the Akaso EK7000 I won't spend the extra for a Go Pro. This action cam does almost everything I need. The small wrist mounted remote was dead on arrival but a couple of email with customer service and a new one was in the mail. Great costumer service!I wish the camera had a longer battery life though 1 to 1.5 hours is good I shoot a lot of time lapse and can be set up for hours on end. Camera doesn't shoot in RAW but in the higher resolution settings it captures more than enough images for a 30 - 60 second time lapse video. Works well as a dash cam while driving too.,5,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0

"It really is hard to beat this action cam.  The picture quality is far better than I expected, the remote on/off/pause is really well done and it mounts to all kinds of surfaces.  I bought one form my nephews for dirt bike riding and they love it.  Takes a time or two to get the angle right so you aren't filming the ground or front tire but once you figure it out, it works great.For me, it is hard to justify spending money on the Go Pro just because technology is changing so quickly and if my nephews crash and wreck the camera, I'm not devastated because I spent several hundred dollars.  I haven't used the camera under water and probably won't.  I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to try the action cam thing at a reasonable cost for a better than expected quality camera system.",5,1,2019-6-8,1,0,0
"Talk about bang for your buck! This camera is incredible. Lightweight, crisp images (and audio!!), standard memory card / usb interfaces. Attached is a video taken recently of a crayfish grab gone wrong. I love this camera - it has a ton of mounting options, easy access to the battery compartment, and out of the box waterproof (completely) to what I can attest to be at least 20ft. Or 1+ atmosphere. I'm _literally_ writing this review right now because I'm back in my order history looking to purchase another. If you're thinking about getting yourself a weatherproof action cam, I can't possibly recommend this one enough.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"For comparison, I've used a go pro and a Sony wide angle action cam. Out of the box, there are issues with the screen- see photos. The images it captures are incredibly grainy especially compared next to quality photos from a Pixel2 cam, go pro, or my Sony.  The battery cover is always randomly popping off which is another huge issue. Lastly, the camera will randomly turn off even though the battery is recently charged and ful- this renders the camera essentially useless because it turns itself off within 60seconds of turning on. My husband said, ""what did you expect for the price?"" To be honest I did expect a functioning camera. I thought it'd be nice to have something that didn't coat an arm and a leg so I wouldn't worry so much about scuffing it or dropping it- turns out I didn't even get a chance to do any of those things. I've only had the cam for about 10days and I've experienced all these issues in that time! Would definitely NOT buy again.",2,1,2019-4-25,1,0,1

Lots of accessories, 2 batteries, although I just got this..so I can’t be sure how long the last. All good, and far less expensive than Go Pro....with very comparable image resolution. Audio...stinks....but I don’t need sound on this.One thing bothers me though, there is a card inside, which offers free accessories, if you post a 5 star review. Right on the card, it asks you do not mention this card, why you ask? Obviously, it’s against Amazon policy...you don’t reward buyers for inflating reviews, and tell the platform you sell on. That’s misleading, isn’t it? So although this is a very good product, for the price, that sort of underhanded method, makes me question their integrity. They really don’t need to do this.....it’s dishonest. I would have given it four stars, but that bugs me. And no, I don’t think it’s better than a Go Pro......",4,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0

We found the AKASO EK7000, and could not be more thrilled!  We are having so much fun with time lapse, mounting it in the car and driving around town, and placing it on the floor to get close-ups of the cats fighting.  It will also be useful as a body cam in his line of work, as his department does not yet have them, and you can never be too careful these days when people are so litigious.  For the price, that will be an excellent insurance policy, something we hadn't even thought about until we saw the size and portability of it.  Thank you for such a fun and useful product!!",5,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
Seeing is believing. Don't belive the other reviews because they are getting paid to give good reviews. The product also came with something that stated if u leave a 5 star reveiw on Amazon you'll receive a bunch of things. The wife and I were very excited to get this and try it out. We tried and sent it back 2 days later because the picture was EXTREMELY grainy looking (especially if dark like indoors) and the picture was very grainy and pixelated if u were outside.

"I feel a bit duped after recording my first long video with this. Upon playback of this important footage I realized this camera does not have a microphone and therefore does not record audio. I feel intentionally mislead as the description does not mention this nor did any of the reviews I read. How can this camera have 12k 5 star reviews, but cannot record audio?So far I've recorded 3 hours of beautiful silent film. At least it actually records video, unlike my POS GoPro Hero 3 which died from not being used for 6 months.",2,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"Update* this camera is actually pretty nice. Playback of 4K recordings is choppy, but once you download it to your phone through the iSmart DV (on the iPhone in this case) it’s perfectly fine. The AKASO DV app is buggy and that’s what I downloaded at first but then I read the owners manual (which is a QR code just hold your phone camera up to it and it should give you a link to it) and it recommended the iSmart DV app. It’s fun to use in the pool and the waterproof case works perfectly fine. For the money it’s a great little piece of tech! A GoPro is t worth it to me since I’m not using the camera everyday. But if you want a really smooth 4K video, I recommend a camera that records in 4K 60fps instead of this cameras 24 FPS. But for vacations and mountain biking once in a while this camera is perfectly adequate! So far so good.",4,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0

The reviews are good so I figured I'd give it a shot. Well, not only it is good enough, it's great!  Crystal clear video and it's very easy to save the videos to my computer via the phone app. It's awesome!  Battery life is great, the accessories that came with it made it very easy to mount and I now have hours of first quality video of my trips to share and watch again. The app works perfectly and is so easy. The wrist remote is particularly convenient as I can flip the camera on and off while fighting a big fish.  Perfect fit for what I wanted and an excellent value. Very, very pleased with this little camera.I've never dunked it in the saltwater but I did video in a pond near my house and was down to about 10 feet and not a drop of moisture got in the case so I have no doubts it would be fine.

"Purchased this for two reasons: one, since I wanted to have an ‘action cam’ option, and the idea of being able to get one for $45 bucks sounded appealing, especially at 1080p or 4k.  Two, I was hoping to be able to use the HDMI out as an extra live stream possibility for OBS and other applications.On number one – the camera is pretty decent.  It is NOT as good 1080 quality as say a DSLR, or any other pro camera.  I had thought that perhaps the pixilation of the review videos on Amazon were just a byproduct of the upload to Amazon; but there is some measure of grain and pixilation the output.  Tried to increase to 2700 and different frame rates – so far same effect.  This is not to say however, that the picture is bad.  It’s not bad.  But if you’re a professional videographer, do not think that this will be the same as go-pro footage.",3,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"I waited a few months before posting a review to see how it held up... we are 10 months in and I love this thing! It first went along with me on a trip to Hawaii, where I kept it in the waterproof case the whole time. Bc I had this camera, I was able to get video of my friends and I jumping off waterfalls, snorkeling, and playing in the water! I have some pictures I wouldn't otherwise have! Bc it is in a case and you're in the water, of course you're sometimes going to have water spots in the middle of the photos or some occasional odd light refraction in the pic, but overall I got some really good shots. Again I took it with me swimming at Balmorhea State Park and got some fun video of the fishes swimming around. I couldn't upload any of my videos for the review. I just recently moved to Hawaii and my camera has survived the move and being tossed around aggressively. Overall, I have been really impressed with this little guy, especially at how much cheaper it is compared to a GoPro. I've purchased a few additional accessories to go along with it and all the generic GoPro equipment fits.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,1,1
"This camera was amazing!!!! It took the best photos and videos. Even under water I could still record sound. I have been playing one of my videos over and over again because I can hear the waves and water hitting the shore. The sound is so peaceful it helps me sleep. The waterproof case held up well and I ended up leaving my camera in the waterproof case for the whole trip even during my hikes. I had wonderful clear photos to show all my friends and family. The only downside for me was the battery life. I have contemplated buying a couple more batteries so I could take photos and video for longer. Luckily they do include 2 batteries to start, so it was really nice to change them out.Update: The batteries are not an issue at all! I bought a battery bank to charge my phone while on vacation. I brought the battery bank to the beach with me to charge my phone, and instead I would use one battery to film in the water while the other charged. It worked wonderfully! Since purchasing, I have taken this camera on several vacations and adventures. I have snorkeled in Maui, Hiked in San Francisco, and explored the beautiful Rocky Mountains with this camera. I never take it out of the waterproof case (probably because I am lazy) but it the camera takes such clear photos in the case that I don't see a need to take it out. I have suggested this camera to my other family members for their trips. Although a Go Pro has better features you really can't beat this camera for the price.",5,1,2018-9-15,1,0,0
"This is a fantastic little camera!  I bought it on an impulse just to see what it was like, and I couldn't be happier.The price is great and includes a number of accessories (e.g., waterproof housing, mounting brackets, two batteries, and more).  Add on a microSD card (not included), and you have everything you need to get started right away.",5,1,2018-4-1,1,1,1
"If you're flipping between 2 action cameras trying to decide which one to pull the trigger on...pick this one!! You will not find a better action camera at this price point.  Bought for my upcoming vacation, allowed my 2 youngest children to test it out.  Video quality is great. App/WiFi feature makes downloading videos super easy, you will have to try both recommended apps though.  Sound quality through water proof case isn't horrible.  Did notice a tiny bit of fogging in waterproof case which means there is a bit of leakage somewhere.  Overall though for $50 this is a fantastic purchase!! In fact I just ordered 3 more for our family to use on vacation and out doing charters",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"The battery life on this product is insanely short.  I have adjusted the recording quality and was able to get about an hour out of it but compared to a name-brand version this is terribly inadequate.  They do give you two batteries but I was unable to get past lunch on a day of skiing- AND it is kind of a pain to switch the batteries while you are out doing an activity. For the handful of minutes that it does work- the picture quality is right on par with others that I have seen so no problems there.  Also, the price is FANTASTIC, but . . .you get what you pay for.  Do not leave the house without the spare battery easily accessible and even then don't expect you'll be able to film yourself for more than an hour.**UPDATE**  Months later, a customer rep reached out to me to offer two new spare batteries.  I have to admit that I wasn't able to greatly increase the battery life- BUT, equipped with 4 fully charged battery packs I certainly have enough time to record most of what I need on a given day.  Battery still not great- but customer service and working with the company affords them an additional star!",3,1,2018-2-21,1,1,0
"I have used several of these from mounted on a motorcycle, to scuba diving on shipwrecks, strapped on R/C vehicles and bashed around, to hauled underneath drones. Despite being a fraction of the cost of other brands, these have always worked perfectly for me. They come with a ton of mounts, a waterproof case (and it has worked to 100 feet in frigid New England waters), extra battery, etc.You can pay more for a similar product, then cringe when you lose it in the surf at high tide (true story), or when you slam a drone into a brick building (also a true story). I find these more than capable for anything I've thrown at them.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"Purchased this camera for a trip south to the Keys around mid Feb. I was a bit worried about the functionality being that it's on the cheaper end of the action camera world. This thing did wonderful! far surpassed expectations! I used a wrist strap purchased in a cheap kit that did great, and I was able to swim with it. the case didn't leak (I had a spare but didn't use it) and the battery held up well. all in all would buy again and recommend this model. I didn't go with the touch screen because with the case only the buttons work anyway. wonderful action cam!",5,1,2020-5-20,1,2,1
"All in all I'm impressed. A few of my friends have GoPros and I've always wanted to camera that style but couldn't afford it. The ek7000 came up on a flash sale. And I just couldn't resist it. Opening the box I was truly surprised by all of the accessories inside. All the different mounts in wireless remote 2 batteries charging station I thought to myself all this for so little. There's no way this camera can be any good. So I gave it a try. I made a couple of short videos with it and upload it into the computer. Into the side by side comparison with videos from a Hero 5 The video quality was very close. As was the sound but the image stabilization on the ek7000 Was much better. If you're looking for a compact action camera Look, no further. You need to give one of these a try.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
This product is by far the most reliable camera I've ever had my hands on.It was only intended for any accidents/incidents that would occur whenever I'm out and about on my motorcycle. It comes with the camera (of course) with extra accessories as well as batteries whenever you're touring. What's really cool is the fob remote that they give you. No need to fiddle around with the camera to see whether or not you're recording. And it comes with the screen as well. Reason why this is brought up because the camera is much more affordable than a standard GoPro. Even the modest GoPro Session is 5 times more than the Akaso.,5,1,2019-8-4,1,2,0
"Just recieved the cam. Its cool i knew it wouldnt be like a go pro but it is ideal for what i want it for like kayaking,out camping and mudding.I put it to the test today as a dash cam i mounted it from my headliner near winshield but back like 10"" from it i read plenty of reviews before i bought this cam. It worked great until about 20mins in it overheated i had the ac on and it was cold in the car i was dissapointed.",4,1,2019-5-31,1,0,0
"I have been looking for some kind of action camera to use that is waterproof. This is so I could film videos of me going underwater and to just have something to film fun videos of me and my friends. Of course like most people I first looked at a GoPro but was shocked at how expensive they are. So I looked up action cameras on Amazon and this one of the first things to come up. $60 and 12,000+ with over 4 stars as an average rating?! Sounds amazing! So I bought it and once it delivered to my house I started using it for several months and was amazed by how amazing of a camera I got. So many mounts and accessories came in the box. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would for sure recommend it to a friend! The iPhone app is slow and could use some improvement though.",4,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"**UPDATE: AKASO sent me a EK7000 pro camera to replace this one. It does have the time lapse video feature that I need. I am impressed with the customer service and with the quality and utility of the camera.  I am still not sure if this older model has been updated to be able to shoot time lapse, so I will leave my previous comments up. ** --- Unfortunately, when AKASO says ""time lapse"" mode, what they actually mean is timer mode, as in push the button and run around and pose in front of the camera which will wait several seconds before taking the photo. THIS IS NOT TIME LAPSE. I am extremely disappointed and would not recommend anyone buying this camera if you want this feature.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0
"I've had this camera for several months now and do not recommend it for several specific reasons:1 - The claimed resolution seems dubious. For example, shooting in 2k with the camera looks about the same as 1080 on my older gopro cameras. This is with the same mount, same environment, and exposure. It simply doesn't look as good.",2,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera for my son to use while we travel.  He's always wanting to take videos and photos on the beach and he's super excited to have access to this.  I haven't put the camera through its paces yet, but I will update this review once we return from our trip with first hand experience.Instructions and information that comes with the camera is pretty sparse.  There is a quick guide included in the packaging and a .pdf file online to download the users manual.  There are several helpful videos online that explain the different attachment uses.  I knocked a star off for having to dig around online to figure out what everything is.",4,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"I had very low expectations about this camara. For the price that I bought it it could not record any decent videos. Oooh I was wrong, way wrong. Not only I been using the camara everywhere I take my son to but also I bought another and have verbally recommended this camara to every friend. I have recorded videos at night with low light and the videos come out great. I have not record any extreme video so I would not comment on image stabilization. But for my every day time keeping and library building this is the way to go. I had plans to buy another one just to keep it in different locations but it's soo easy to move around that I don't have the need for a second one.Now I would like to get their higher version to see what is like. I absolutely recommend this camara to anyone who would like to record precious moments at an affordable price.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I was taking a last minute vacation to Curaçao and wanted to capture our snorkeling adventures. I didn’t have the money to spend on a more expensive name brand camera and the reviews for this were promising.I am throughly impressed with this little camera, especially for the price! The picture and video quality were great. Battery life was good- we did a mix of videos and a still photos. Each charge was sufficient for our snorkel adventures.  I highly recommend this camera to someone who wants to capture those beach adventures without breaking the bank.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,1
i have had the EK7000 since July 2017 with the  Sports bundle. I  recommend both. The camera has worked well. I have it set for 1080p at 60fps since I do not have a 4K monitor. When using it in my car I can read license plates up to a distance of about 40+ feet and even in a lane over..  Battery life is on the order of 45 minutes of recording. Sound quality is good. The cell phone smart app can be downloaded at google play store but have found that is has  some bugs - Like shutting the camera down after a few minutes. So clearly I don't use it. The included remote control works fine. I mostly use the camera when driving through the canyons or at Willow Springs raceway. I am buying a  second one to get interior and rear view shots.,5,1,2017-12-29,1,1,0
"For the price point, it has great picture and video quality. It works as you'd expect it to, for the most part...Unfortunately, the main features you'd want to work end up not working in specific scenarios.",4,1,2019-8-17,1,1,0
I followed the reviews and purchased this camera instead of the expensive GoPro. While the sound quality is not as good I was very pleased with the purchase. I used it for a Spartan race twice. Had to work out some issues (with the way I was working it) on the first race but the next one came out great. It was not a perfect a picture as I've seen from GoPros but certainly worth the money when compared. Very happy with the product.,5,1,2018-12-8,1,2,0
This little camera takes very clear pictures and videos. I put it on our rock crawler and the first couple of times the videos was very clear . But I didn't have it strap down to good. And it moved a little causing a shaking videos. But still very clear videos.  That and trying to drive a rc car that only has fast speed. Then  i strapped it down with zip ties on a slower rc rock crawler never moved. And it was a lot better what great videos . No shaking videos. I also put it on a little tripod on my deck and video a chipmunk up close . I was awesome. I would recommend this awesome little camera. I haven't tried the water yet. I had problems uploading my video to show you.,5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I am not a big video producer (age 59)...will be go snorkel this year in Mexico and Colorado ski.  Did not need to spend ""GoPro"" bucks, therefore this AKASO EK7000 was right for me.  Had 11,000 reviews on Amazon at 4+ star rating and they were correct. Only a few uses so far but came with a bunch of accessories (including underwater case) and after doing this review, they will send me more. Easy to use scrolling menu screen.  Basically didn't need lots of options and this gives me all I need...4K or 2K video, single and burst pics and a neat arm band remote to start/stop the video or take single pics.  So far pleased and the price was 1/3 of GoPro Hero.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying, I bought a GoPro for over $400 at BestBuy. I used it one day and returned it because GoPro requires special software in order to view your videos from a computer. I purchased this AKASO based on the great reviews and price point. The quality is excellent and feels just like the GoPro (which was a great surprise). In my opinion, this is better than the GoPro because, not only does it feel, look and record as nice as a GoPro, you don't need special software to view and edit videos on your computer! (GoPro records videos in a special video format that you can't watch unless you have GoPro software installed.) This AKASO records in standard video formats that make it easy to view on normal video playback software that's already on our computers!",5,1,2016-12-2,1,3,0
"I have been using this camera daily for the past month while riding to work. The picture quality is great and the sound quality has been good for what I need. The waterproof case has worked excellently in heavy rain and the camera is high quality enough to catch license plates while riding. The battery only lasts about 90 minutes but with 2 batteries, I switch to a fresh one for the ride home so I don't lose power on the ride. Overall I've been very happy with the camera and if I had the option again would buy it again.Update: Camera still working very well, with great quality picture. The batteries do degrade over time, only getting a little less than an hour of run time with each one. Overall still a good camera and good for the price.",4,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"To be honest, I bought this camera because I needed a webcam and webcams are almost impossible to get right now and I did some research and found out that this camera could be used as a webcam and also has all the functionality of an action camera!They shipped super fast and set up was so easy! This camera is 10 times better than the stock webcam on my laptop, so it is doing everything that I intended to use it for.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Well, I kinda like the quality, but still my go pro session still  better quality with 1080 than this camera, despite its making good pics and videos.

Very low, and you barely hear unless you stick your memory into computer and volume up all available speakers connected to your computer...",3,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"Tried the camera for the very first time today and was impressed with the quality of the video.  Stabilization was very good.  For the cost you could not ask for better.  In fact  the quality of the images and the camera itself is as good, if not better than higher priced action cameras.  The instructions which you go on line to view the manual were pretty straight forward and easy to follow. The camera came with a lot of essential attachments that you do not have to pay extra for. They even provide you with 2 batteries.  I used the bike attachment.  Ended up buying 2 cameras, one for me and one for the wife.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0

Many companies would not do this. I was very happy with my experience and enjoyed the camera itself before my incident.

"So glad I purchased this instead of spending the money on a Go Pro or another more expensive option. As with many people that purchase action cameras I'm sure I used this a few times and it's been sitting in a drawer ever since. It's not that it isn't a great camera I just am not quite as awesome as I thought I am it appears. Ha. Seriously though it's a great camera for a snowboard trip or a trip out of town but not something I use every day. I took it snowboarding and the image stabilization was great. I had to play around with it to find the angle I liked the best but I got some great video I'll be happy to have years later I'm sure. We also took it on a vacation and let our nieces and nephews play around with it in the pool. The case worked perfectly to keep water out and they had a blast taking some absolutely terrible video that made me sick to watch as they have no idea not to just move the camera all over the place with no sense of direction. It was great fun for them and I didn't have to worry about them wrecking my camera that cost hundreds of dollars as I would if I bought a more expensive model. I'm looking forward to taking it on future trips and with me surfing, filming our kids learning to ski, motorcycle riding etc.",5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
"Just like some of the other cheap knock offs, this probably has it's place but not in my selection of cameras. Quality is OK. However, it's very annoying that every time you change the battery you have to reset the date and time. Other settings seem to be saved so why not the date and time. I'll stick with the more complete product that can actually do simple things.UPDATE 09/28/2018 to 5 stars from 2: Akaso reached out to me to help solve this issue. They sent a new V50 camera that will now hold it's date/time settings while you change the battery. Kudo's to Akaso for the great customer service (5 stars on customer service) and standing behind their product. That is very much appreciated in today's world where many companies don't stand behind their products and have poor customer service.",5,1,2018-2-1,1,0,0
"We wanted to get action cams so we could see what our school age kids were seeing as they ran youth motorsports races. We weren’t too sure about forking out the cash on a more expensive brand since lost objects are common with young kids.  We settled on this one as a much more wallet friendly alternative. We weren’t expecting a ton out of it but we’re pleasantly surprised. It’s actually a pretty nice little camera. Videos are clear and colors are great, even when running snow/ice races on a sunny day.  We’re fans of the wifi connectivity as we can watch the videos on our phones/tablets immediately without having to wait to get to a computer. It also came with a nice assortment of mounting pieces that have come in handy. Can’t really go wrong with this one and we’d recommend it to anyone looking for something in this price range.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

As far as performance it is pretty good. Better battery life than GoPro 90 mins vs 50 mins. 4K video is only 25 frames per second vs GoPro 4k 60fps, but the default 1080 / 60fps on this camera is great enough for most of us.

"I got this for my 9 year old she’s into video and photography. Got it in a flash deal so I saved about $15. I didn’t want to spend too much like a ho pro because she is just a kid and hopefully this won’t get lost or stollen. Thought this may be better than the kids video cams with the quality, screen and large storage. I thought a 64GB SD card was included but it was not(maybe I viewed too many action cams and got it mixed up thinking this came with it all. I’m just getting all the pieces out of the box and familiarizing myself with it so I could help her figure how to use it. It comes with a lot of attachments and extra pieces, love the wireless option too. I wanted something of good quality, storage space and waterproof, I think this may have it all except for having to now purchase a separate SD card.

Rain often accompanies me while traveling so it was important to have a camera with good protection.  It didn't miss a beat in a downpour in Kentucky which lasted for hours.  The AKASO comes with amany accessories right out of the box, including two batteries and a tiny charger.  It is easy to use and the performance is much better than I had expected. After watching the Isle of Man race on TV I'm thinking I need to buy a few more!  My suggestion is to buy a couple of them on your first order.  You won't be disappointed.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"I'm not impressed with this camera; ""astonished"" would be closer to the mark.  Purchased this Akaso EK 7000 based on a recommendation from a friend of my wife's, and I just can't believe what this little camera can do for the money we put into it.  As a caveat, we're not pushing the camera to the limits of human endurance by skydiving, mountain biking, scuba diving or the like.  But it works extremely well for our needs.My wife competes in dog obedience training, and likes to review videos of her dog's performance after trials and matches.  Finding someone willing and capable to record her session in the ring on a cellphone is always difficult.  Most of the other dog handlers are preoccupied with their dogs, and it's not good ring etiquette to approach too close to the show ring to shoot video, since that will be a distraction.  She noticed another handler retrieving a tiny camera from just outside the corner of the ring after her session and asked about it.  Turned out to be this little EK 7000, and that handler was very enthusiastic about what it could do.  When my wife asked for it for Christmas I was skeptical, so I spent a lot of time researching this and several other cameras.  While there were other cameras that were able to do what the Akaso could do, and possibly even more, they were all at least two to three times as expensive.  So I went ahead and gave this to my wife for Christmas.",5,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0
"Very good action camera for what it is worth. My boyfriend has a GoPro that he paid hundreds for and he's constantly on his toes about breaking or losing it. This camera is almost just as good and I don't stress out as much about how much I paid for it. It has a lot of features as far as recording options but I only really use it for 1080p at 60fps. It does time lapses but you have to make sure its set to 'continuous lapse' under settings. I haven't taken the camera underwater just yet but I tested the case with a dry paper towel inside then plunged it in the pool and it worked just fine. The mounts and case are the same as that for GoPro, and this company definitely provides a good amount to start you off with. They even give you an extra battery and charging unit for the battery. Would have been nice to have a full extra housing case, but they do provide another backing. I would have given this review 5 stars but I notice a weird diagonal lag when I record (at 1080p and 60fps). It is most prominent in dark areas when I am moving the camera around and it gets annoying because the picture looks really choppy. All the other reviews and posted videos seem to working just fine though, so maybe it is only mine.",4,1,2017-4-6,1,1,0
"I had to admit that I am blow away by the quality of this camera, both for videos and photos. When I ordered it, I still had doubts, could such a good camera cost so little? Yes, it can! Not only is the camera great, it comes with a plethora of mounting options. It even has a wrist-strap with a remote control! Now the Android app which this comes with (Akaso DC) is rather slow and primitive. Barely gets a passing grade. I read that you can use other (better) apps. I don't know. What I do know is that this camera is a steal and I highly recommend it. Last but not least, if I ever break it, it's only 60 bucks or less to replace. Frankly, I see no point in getting a GoPro after trying this camera.Try it - you will love it!",5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0

Needless to say it was a great disappointment! I was unable to take pictures and videos while snorkeling.  I wished that I had invested more money and got a quality underwater camera!!

We took pictures with it mounted on my helmet biking and white water rafting and even numerous pictures swimming underwater. It worked great. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start rating is battery life. I got about 47 minutes of video on our whitewater rafting trip in two separate segments. I started a third segment, but the camera did not save the last segment before the battery died. So... A word to the wise. Stop and restart the camera frequently, especially when the battery is getting low, so it will save those video clips.",4,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
Returned it because it doesnt work as it says and some reason it is now a gift card balance. Super unsatisfied and no customer service numbers are operating at this time.. little frustrating when I paid with a debit card. No video stability really and the app is terrible that you have to use for the camera. Never let me go above 720 quality.UPDATE: A worker from akaso kindly sent me a replacement and I got to mess around with the controls more. Idk how but this one is a lot more stable and started in 1080hp quality still no 4k... and still not the best app in the universe. But way better quality than what I originally purchased. It's even brighter and has a higher contrast. So maybe the first one was just a return. This one even came in plastic wrap unlike my first camera. So far so good. Also have always loved the underwater capability. Never had any leaks in the case.,4,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"I purchased this camera to film my son's travel baseball games.

However, my time frame was such that I needed to get a replacement camera from Amazon. That was done quickly and without a problem. The case did come eventually.As advertised, the audio does not record well when the underwater case is in place, and, being on board a boat for the week, it rarely came off so most of my videos are without sound.",4,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0

The batteries last right around an hour, decent, but not great.It's easy to use, the menu is easy to navigate to set the time and date, or video resolution.  I haven't tried the water resistance or image stabilization.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Okay, so this is my first action camera. It came very well packaged and very fast. So cudos on that. I was going to buy a GoPro but I decided since this is strictly for insurance purposes,  I don’t make professional videos or do moto vlogging, I didn’t see the point in spending 200$ plus on a cam.The video quality is pretty good and has multiple options, the better the video the shorter the time you can record and vise versa. I’m still playing around to find that “just right” but after a test today I was impressed.",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,1
"After losing my Gopro when surfing, I decided to buy a rather cheap one in case I lose another one.This camera is pretty good for its cost. The video quality is okay, but the protecting case isn't 100% waterproof.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0

"We got this for our 9 year old son because he wanted to start a YouTube channel. Well, he did and he loves it. It’s got all sorts of attachments that come with it which took us some time to figure out, but once we did, we realized you can attach this thing nearly anywhere. And he does. From the bike to film stunts, to the computer to film him playing video games (why this is a thing I still don’t understand:) he uses often. And yes, he’s 9 so you know it’s easy to operate. We also took it in the pool as it comes with a waterproof case. The underwater shots are far superior to what I would’ve suspected. A great little unit at a great price.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,1
"Excellent, it's a small camera, the resolution of the videos is great outside, but inside houses, or places with low lighting the video and the photos are of low quality. I'm very proud of de camera.It works with a SanDisk 64GB Ultra.",5,1,2018-12-14,1,5,1
"So, my husband and I do a ton of dirt bike riding and we love having videos of all the riding we do. He has a Go Pro and I decided I needed a camera, too. Not wanting to pay $400 for a new action camera, I found this Akaso after a few minutes of searching. I was a little skeptical because it's so reasonably priced. I just got it today and man am I so pleased!!! As soon as I got home, I got the camera out and started playing with it. To my pleasure, this thing takes really good videos and pictures. Not to mention, my husband is a little jealous that I have a remote for mine! :) We are going camping/riding this weekend and I can't wait to use it! I'm seriously so excited that I found such a great deal!",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I was willing to give this camera a chance for the price. Boy was I right for doing that. This little camera already has made recording videos a breeze. I like that it came with a wrist remote to record and a waterproof case.plus other accessories. The user interface once you get use to it was no problem to navigate. My only complaints are that when the camera is in the waterproof case, the camera cant pick all conservation. But that might be for the best at times. LOL And that you cant zoom in and zoom out. If you can I haven't found out. Ill blame that on user error if I can. Other than that I like it. Update 9/22/20. I have been using it for zoom now that im going back to college after 21 years and its look great. or should I say I look great",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"Great camera, easy to use.  Bought this because I misplaced my GoPro and cannot bring myself to spend that much again.  Glad I did - this camera feels similar to my GoPro, connects easily to my phone and came with a lot of great accessories.  I also found that I can use many of the accessories I previously purchased and didn't lose, which is even better.  I knocked off 1 star because the casing came a bit scratched up, but not a major issue and I probably won't feel as bad when I start scratching it some more.  I definitely miss not needing a case, but again, not a big deal.  I would recommend!",4,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"I was going back and forth between a 3 and 5,  the pictures are fantastic,  look really great.  I setup the camera to take pictures of a garage being built on my property every 1 min.  It works with no issues.  It's siting on a container in my house, and i just open the window.  The only issue i have seen, is the LCD looks likes there's a water spot in the center of it.  The longer the camera is on, the larger the spot gets, and it's annoying.  If i get it fixed, i will raising this to a 5 start rating, if not, I will knock it down to 3 star.  It doesn't affect the usability of it.You can adjust the size of the picture from 720-4K,  I have a 64G card in it, and take hundreds of pictures at a time, while plugged in.  Havn't used the battery yet, so can't comment on how well that work.  But it does come with 2 batteries.",4,1,2017-10-20,1,1,0
"Update 02/09/2019: Now that this camera has been in use for a couple months, there are a couple additions to make to the review. First of all, the video quality is excellent. However, a couple of issues have become apparent. The most significant is an occasional failure to save a video clip on the camera card. I don't discover that a file has been corrupted until I load the video files onto the computer. My card has the correct specifications, and the vast majority of the files are saved without issue. Just know that occasionally video clips will be corrupted, so reliability is definitely an issue. Second, the battery door is not affixed to the camera, and the little latch for it is cheaply made. The latch for my battery door is already broken. It is still functional, but definitely frustrating to use. It makes switching batteries in active situations (fishing, hiking, etc) quite challenging. Finally, I've got to repeat that the video quality and image is outstanding, but the audio leaves a lot to be desired.I was looking for a camera that would capture my outdoor adventures. Over the years I have lost and/or broken multiple expensive cameras while hunting, fishing, and snorkeling. This camera has done a wonderful job for me so far - the mounting options are terrific, very easy to use, and the wide angle coverage is impressive. Images are smooth and crystal clear.",5,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"Purchased this camera for snorkeling in Costa Rica. I was really wanting a go pro for the top of my full face snorkel mask but then read reviews on this product and am so happy I did. This camera is much cheaper but of very good quality. Some reviews I read stated that the camera was difficult to navigate through all the settings or to set up due to a lack of instructions. It’s true that the quick start guide that comes with the camera doesn’t give you much info, however it includes a QR code which takes you to the full user’s manual. I had no difficulty setting up the camera following the manual and was even able to save the manual to my ebooks app on my phone. The only complaint I have is that I wish the extra case back was waterproof. The fact that it is not is written in the manual but I feel like it should be emphasized because it does look like it would be waterproof since it is made to attach to the back of the clear waterproof case. Overall I’m very happy with this purchase and glad I got it instead of spending much more for a GoPro",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,1
Amazing little camera:Akaso Camera Review,5,1,2018-10-18,1,0,0
"What can I say I am impressed, video, picture and sound quality is great even with waterproof case on. Some people say there is no sound with case on, let me tell you it works just fine. Spent the day out kayaking filming and taking pics they came out really good. The remote is awesome simple to use red for pics and grey for video. Camera menu is Lil tricky to get used to but I’ve only had this camera for a little while. I have not tested it under water but I will when I go on my cruise to the Bahamas and in the lake when fishing. You can charge the battery while in camera but you do have to take the case off. Mini SD card up to 64gb. Great amount of accessories, 2 batteries and external charger. Comes well packaged and if you contact the vendor they are quick to reply. Time will be the test for quality.",5,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0
"I bought this product thinking that I'm getting a really good deal on a Go-pro generic, but this really isn't in the same ballpark. The manual is inaccurate so you have to figure some things out yourself. That's not the main problem though. For the price I paid, I'd keep it if that was the only issue. The issue is that the camera doesn't record sound with the waterproof case on! It barely records with the case off! I took the case off and spoke into the microphone from about 12 inches away. When I played it back, I could barely  hear my voice. If you want an action cam, pay for what you want. Video quality is good, but sound is terrible, and non existent with the case. I WAS going to use it going kayaking. Oh well.",1,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
I bought this to bring to a music festival. The first day the screen went crazy and the camera would not turn off. I removed the battery and replaced it but the camera never turned on again. Extremely disappointed with this product and I hope I can get a refund.Edit/Update: I purchased this in February and after seeing my review the company contacted me via email to offer a refund. As of December I have received a full refund of the product from the manufacturer even though it was past amazon’s return period.,5,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"Keep in mind that most of the positive reviews here are posted simply because the seller bribes positive reviewers with additional accessories. Of course they are already included in the price and to get what you have paid for you are forced to type a review. Basically this is the only reason why I gave the 5 stars originally and reduced it to three.  However the text below that I posted a couple of months ago is correct. The camera is really good for the price.Bought it as a gift to my 8-years old son. It turned out to be much more than a toy. The picture quality is perfect, he keeps dropping the camera, however it is still functional. The number of auxiliary items is really surprising, we never used even 10% of them.",3,1,2018-12-5,1,1,0
"so far the product arrived on time and in great shape. Box had padding to help prevent it from bouncing around while in transit. i love the fact that it has a separate charging station for the battery, the remote control is a really cool feature. Has plenty of attachments to mount pretty much anywhere . i bought this with the intention of using it for review my MTB trips to make better runs, but now ill be bringing it along on my honey moon to capture moments together. Cant wait to use it ill update once i take it down the trail see how she holds up to the abuse.",5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"For the price - this camera is awesome.  This camera stacks up against gopro quite well.  Mine is used in conjunction with a gopro i already have for flights (i'm a pilot), and it does a fantastic job overall, sound and picture quality are comparable.  And for the price - there are no complaints from me.  Given that, i will note the areas where it is rough around the edges: 1) the battery is a not as robust as my gopro.  2) the camera will overheat in the sun in it's little waterproof enclosure - i get around this by leaving the case back popped open and use a rubber band to keep camera in place in the enclosure.Again - for the price... i'd buy 3 more before i bought a gopro.  I'd just make sure i could power them for the longer flights more consistently, and make sure they are keeping cool.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"Living in Minnesota, we like to get away from the cold and snow to warm places to keep our sanity.  Avid hikers, beach bums, and snorkelers, we wanted a small camera that we could take snorkeling to capture some of the wildlife and underwater scenes.  Since it's something we only use once or twice a year and something that we use to add to the repository of photos and videos that we may not look at very often, it seemed silly to spend upwards of $300-$400.  As we perused options, this seemed like it was too good to be true.  It's totally functional, absolutely waterproof (in the appropriate included case), and it gets the job done.  The still camera photos are not as high resolution as I would have liked, but we mostly use the for video in the water.  For that, it's ideal.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I needed a webcam during the period of time when most webcams were sold out because of the pandemic. I decided to purchase this camera as an alternative and I 100% made the right choice. If you have your own separate microphone already and need a webcam, don't even hesitate before purchasing this camera.I thought I would have to go through a long process to get it working as a webcam, but I couldn't have been more wrong. All I had to do was connect the USB cord from the camera to my PC and it immediately went into PC Camera mode. My computer set it up as a webcam and I was up and running within 1-2 minutes. You don't even need to have batteries or a memory card in the camera to use it as a webcam.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,1,0
"This camera is awesome.  I did not appreciate it while on vacation.  I could not tell when it was on or off.  The screen is small and I am too old to see it well.  So, I wasn't expecting much.  I just uploaded my pictures and videos.  Wow!  I didn't even know it had sound.  It did not leak either.  I have had a lot of underwater cameras over the years.  They were 3 times as expensive and did not have all the features of this one.  Take some time and learn how to work it.  It is somewhat confusing.  I think the remote died shortly after taking it in the water. OOPS.  Lots of different kinds of attachments, but no way to connect to a wrist strap.  I used an old glasses saver and had no problems . But I am going to look for some other way to secure it since I don't have a go-pro mask.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"I bought to go and make videos while playing airsoft but I a mount. I did however test it in my front yard with my dog to see how it captured color, movement, sound, and picture. All test that I did were inside the protective waterproof casing.Color - Color was not perfect but it's not so bad that you wouldn't like it for the price you get it.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I bought this for an upcoming dive trip and wanted to give it a test run before using this under water. I am very impressed with how simple it is to use and the quality of the pictures and video. I tested the video in and out of the waterproof case. Video was great and sound was OK with the case on, but perfect without the case. It comes with a good assortment of mounts and tools to get the best shot possible. I did purchase an accessory kit that had a bit more options, but it wasn't necessary. I added a 64GB card and can take almost 10,000 photos and over 2 hours of video in 4K; over 6 hours in 1080P. I should have set the date and time before using, but I was excited to get started with the photography. I cannot wait to get this in the ocean!",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,1
"It looks great! It would be useful to know what size/specifications of memory card to purchase to go with it when ordering the camera, because now I have to wait to try it out until my memory card arrives.I also wish it had some information in the package about what each of the mounting pieces are for. I’m giving this 4 stars since I’m not able to test it right away. I will update this review after I’m able to try it out.",4,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"This camera was purchased with the hopes that it would fit into the Tarot T-2D Gimbal which is made specifically for GoPro 3/4.  When it arrived, the Akaso camera fit into the base of the gimbal and the holder that goes around the lens fit quite nicely, albeit a little pressure is needed to get the holder into place.  However, the screws that connect the lens holder to the base of the gimbal were too short.  With a little drilling of the holes on the gimbal so that the head of the screws slide in a little deeper, I was able to get them to reach to the base.  So now I am able to use this Akaso camera on a gimbal that was made for GoPro Hero 3/4.  I am very satisfied with the first video I took here at home using the gimbal and dji phantom 1 drone.Hope this helps someone out there!  God Bless America!",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,1
"I bought this low cost camera for a 27 day motorcycle trip from Texas to Alaska and back via the Pacific coast. I knew I would be compromising on something, vs the GoPro, but the compromise was only in the inability of the camera to keep the data and time.  What happened is that every time I turned the camera on, it would start at the Data and Time I last set. The instructions say you need to reset it when you remove the battery, but I never removed the battery and never let the battery go dead.  Once I figured this out, I stopped using the data and time ""stamp"" on the pictures, and made sure to set the Date correctly at the start of each day, so at least I had the right day of the trip.  Unfortunately, since it started at the Time I set, all of my pictures had a time of between 08:00 and 08:10 or 08:15 as I set the time at 08:00 when setting the correct Date.  The effect of this is that the pictures are not in order taken, they are intermixed as the time was always within the same short window starting at 8:00.  Makes it impossible to align the pictures with the location based on trip plan for the day.  I will say that the camera held up well in the waterproof case, even when it fell off the bike at about 30 mph and bounced down an exit ramp. No damage done.  I would not buy this one again due to the time issue, maybe the next model up by Akaso does a better job with that basic function",4,1,2019-8-5,1,0,1

"It’s a cheap camera so expectations have to be tailored to it. It’s not a GoPro. I use it as a “dash cam” for my motorcycle. I wanted to buy a cheap one just in case I forget about it on the motorcycle and it gets stolen while I’m gone.The camera is ok but comes with a good amount of accessories. Each battery lasts about 2 hours or so. Make sure you have the latest version of the app or it might not work that well. When it is somewhat cold, the video footage sometimes skips. The app is pretty user friendly as is the camera once you get the hang of it.",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"I bought this camera to take time lapse of a house build. Unfortunately, the advertising on this page misrepresented the camera's capabilities. However, this little thing took some very good photos, and videos throughout the trip. I did not expect it to do so well for the price that I paid. It does not compare to a Go-pro in performance, but then again it is a heck of a lot less expensive. Overall, I rate this thing well, but am disappointed in the advertising on this page misrepresenting its features.",4,1,2019-3-15,1,1,0

"Got to admit, I kind of love this thing. Been reading a lot of reviews online lately about the next to GoPro killer. And while I will never consider this a GoPro killer, for the price, it is an outstanding purchase.Took it to the lake kayaking the other day, experimented with the different video modes and stills, Etc. Image quality is on par with the competition. Video quality is also pretty darn good. And the fact that it supports GoPros accessories, well that's just icing on the cake.",5,1,2018-7-31,1,0,0
"The sound quality is HORRIBLE with the waterproof case! I plan to return this ASAP!!!! None of my videos are even worth watching because you can't hear ANYTHING!!! Highly, highly, highly disappointed and will be reaching out to the product owners of this device. I bought everything that I needed and I was incredibly excited to make videos, which I made ALLLLLL DAYYYY yesterday and are now essentially worthless. All of my content is ruined because none of it can be heard besides loud choppy noises from the camera moving. I do not recommend this camera at all and I plan to shop around very smartly for a new one, as this one with its incredible reviews was able to trick me very easily since everyone had said such great things. Sorry to spread bad news but this is the absolute truth. I am definitely 10000000% returning this camera. Thanks for reading.",1,1,2019-4-25,1,1,0
This has been my worst Amazon purchase yet. The problem isn't really the camera but the software. The EZ iCam app that is supposed to control the camera won't. My cell phone is a Samsung Galaxy S8+. I have watched YouTube videos showing the app controlling the camera and the video from the camera displaying on the cell phone. This appears dependent on whether your cell phone is supported or not. In my case it is not. I can record with the camera and then remove the memory card and watch the videos on my laptop. But no live streaming.,1,1,2019-4-24,1,1,0
Not touch screen so a little tricky to figure out which button does what and I got the hang of it :) dosent have the best quality image not gona lie.. but for the price it’s fine for what I’m using it for. Haven’t put it in water yet.. and there’s an app you can download to connect the screen to your phone that’s pretty cool that Download straight to my camera roll… Sometimes and just realized the battery life is horrible:( I just bought a memory card for it for over 600 hours but the battery maybe lasted three after a full charge.. comes with two batteries btw,5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I am using this to film drone footage. This product comes with every kind of attachment you can imagine.  My best video footage is in 1080p at 30fps. This camera works best in the day time when it’s not so cloudy. It doesn’t adjust for low lighting, but it can be adjusted in post editing. I am still trying to figure out the still images, but I didn’t really buy it for photos. The mic picks up sound, but it will not be loud. I have not tried it in the water and that’s not my reason for purchasing it, but YouTube reviews say the water proof case is in fact water proof.",4,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"This camera is unreliable! I could have a fully charged battery and it somehow surges then dies! after 30 mins. It also does seem to get hot and hotter then expected when moving files over file USB. Not sure why, but it does... What i am displeased with mostly is not knowing if I am still recording. So if this mounted to a helmet, you are diving, and had a good dive, and wanna see what you recorded and well its not there cause it locked up on you and/or battery is drained... yea the level of disappointment is of the scale. I've been playing around with this camera for a couple months and knowing I cannot return is a slight bummer thus after this review, i'm also contacting the company to see if they can do anything about it or upgrade me/it to a ""better"" model...  Moving on to other features, image stabilization is good, probably the best feature on this camera. Recorded quality isn't to bad pending lighting. Picture quality, is 50/50 water shots good, outdoor, when bright, good. Audio is very muffled, so keep that in mind if doing YouTube stuff. Haven't tried the remote feature due to its lack of reliability. The wifi features is the 2nd ""nice"" feature, when it connects properly, but you can delete via wi-fi so you can clear without plugging in.. but having a device to see what you may have recording or not kind of defeats the purpose. Example, if i am using a smartphone to view, might as well but a smart phone enclosures knowing its records/syncs...so to recap,1 locks up very frequently, having to eject battery",1,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I bought this camera (along with an entire accessory kit) for my aspiring you-tuber 8 year old son. It syncs with your phone for digital upload by way of app, which is very simple an easy to do. It is very lightweight and sturdy (as it comes with a protective case.) They only problem that we have run into is picking up static white noise when in action. We bought a noise reduction lapel mic, but in order to connect it to the camera, you can't have the camera enclosed in the case (which means you can't attach any of the accessories; i.e. tripod, head band, chest strap.)",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"This is literally one hell of an action camera. And for the price, it's an absolute no brainer. Truly impressed and a great buy. Very professionally and safely packaged. I've had problems recording smooth videos with previous purchases and this product has fixed my issue. The picture quality is of the highest level, colorful, sharp and realistic. Very easy to transition between the different modes and wowww what a great idea about the remote control. Super handy and much needed. The built-in WiFi is fairly quick and can seamlessly be connected with your smartphone.

"We bought these to use on a snorkeling excursion on our recent cruise, and the excursion was canceled so we didn't get to use them as intended (yet, I hope).  We did use them when swimming at the beach and they're easy to use and fun.However, there are WAY too many accessories with no documentation indicating how any of them are to be used.  And nothing that seemed to be useful for snorkeling, which seems like an obvious use of this product.  We bought the Sametop waterproof floating hand grip to use with this, which works great.  Left all of the other accessories at home, never missed them.  Would be great if there were purchase options about which accessories you want or don't want.",4,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0

This package by Akaso is by far the best of the lot so far - all the mounting pieces fit well, they're all packaged well, and you even get a battery charger and TWO batteries!  Well done, Akaso.  Camera fired up right out of the box, batteries charged in under an hour, and all modes test out just fine. Also, I like the opening mechanism of the plastic case, it snaps open easily and doesn't require a jeweler's screwdriver and three hands to open up.  Highly recommended!",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"This thing is shockingly good for the price! I am very impressed by its build quality, and once I got a decent class 10 memory card it even records quite well. I have it 5 stars on waterproofing for the case but to be fair I've only used it in my hot tub just to test out its capability. And all the accessories are just awesome additions.I was surprised by the remote control, I didn't even notice it was part of the package, a nice little surprise. But the one dig I have (minus one star) is that the app supposedly built for it doesn't work. Won't even connect to it. And I'm quite sure I'm doing it right since another after market app works just fine. This isn't really a big problem for me since I never intended to really use it that way.

"After a lot of searching through action cameras, even gopros, I am very happy with this camera and all of its features and accessories. I bought this action cam to take videos of working k9s that I train, and it works great for that. The night I recieved it, I was playing around with it infront of some friends, and one was just so impressed that he ordered one for himself, just because! The camera and settings menus are easy to navigate and have a lot of options for resolution size, video vs time lapse, burst photo and more. Most all of the accessories are self explanatory and can be used in multiple ways, and I like the option between the waterproof case or the hard plastic skin. The iSmart DV app was very quick and easy to set up and has worked great for me so far. I love the option to be able to set the camera up somewhere, and be able to start recording from my app or bluetooth remote instead of walking over to camera, turning on, walking back into the scene and having to cut all that out in the editing process. One thing I have had to play around with (and it's not necessarily a dislike - I'll admit, Im new at this) is my background or room lighting so the video comes out very clear, but also may have to do with me playing around with my resolution size as well. An excellent alternative to a gopro, will fit gopro mounts, and at a very reasonable price.",5,1,2018-1-6,1,1,0
"I'm a student pilot and I got one of these to record my flying sessions. My flight instructor has a GoPro and it probably cost about three times as much as this one when he got it, but this is even better than his. I love how clear the images are and the sound quality is also really good. These images I'm posting are really just screen shots of one of my video sessions (the dates off by the way, it was much more recent than this but I forgot to reset the clock!) but it will give you a good idea on the clarity. The image stabilization is pretty good too. I need to invest in a better mount for it, but even still, it's so much better than you would expect for the price. The 4k is amazing! I really recommend it highly.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,1
"I don’t review a lot on Amazon, but this little camera is just too cool not to hype up. It was purchased on July 12, 2020 to take on our family beach trip. We wanted to attach to our snorkel masks to video/photograph underwater creatures. I almost purchased a Go Pro, but then saw this. Glad I bought this instead. Picture quality is equal to my sister’s Go Pro, but a fraction of the price. It was easy to transfer video to the app as well. Comes with numerous accessories so will he also using this to mount to my 4 year old’s bike when we ride on the golf cart path. So many possibilities for capturing action sports. Love this little camera and important to note that it works awesome under water with the waterproof case that comes with it. Buy this with complete confidence you are making a good decision!",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"To start off this is not a paid review and I got nothing for this review. Just my honest opinion after having used this while snorkeling in Turks and Caicos last month. I've not used a gopro so I can't really compare it to one but overall I thought the pictures and videos turned out really well. I mostly just used it for underwater pics and videos as I would just use my phone for anything else on the trip. I purchased a 64GB micro The case is definitely waterproof and never had any leaks during the almost 2 hours I had it in the water. Once you figure out what the different functions of the buttons are, it is fairly easy to switch between the different settings even while under the water. The battery life isn't great. I got about an hour or 1.5 hours out of the fully charged battery before I had to switch out the batteries. I purchased additional batteries and had them charged and with me after reading other reviews about the battery life. I was not using the 4K video setting but stayed at the 1080p setting. The size of the view screen does make it difficult to see what you are recording or capturing but that wasn't a big concern for me. I would have left 5 stars if they actually made a filters, especially a red filter, for underwater use. I had to purchase the Sandmarc filter and file down the inside of the filter housing to make it fit onto the AKASO. In the end, this was well worth the $80 I spent on it. The quality of the videos and pictures was really good and not worth paying the price difference for a Gopro. I've attached a few unedited pictures and a short video I took with the AKASO while snorkeling.",4,1,2017-12-3,1,2,1
"I have been playing with the camera for about a month and I really love it.  I have been using it as a dash cam in my car to just record trips around town and the videos are VERY CLEAR and Crisp.  I am still getting the hang of doing video editing, I just need more time to work on my skills.  I think is a GREAT entry level camera and I do recommend this product.**Additional Comment**",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"Got this yesterday. Opened up battery cover and popped battery in and took some videos today. When the battery died I opened the battery compartment and the clip for the door broke. Two uses is all it lasted, checking on Google it seems to be a known issue.....junk it seems",1,1,2017-5-19,1,6,0
"Recently got into more video editing and wanted to pick up a ""cheap"" 3rd cam for multicam shoots. Since it wouldn't be my primary shooter, I didn't want to drop $300+ on a GoPro just to potentially use a few times here and there. The EK7000 had some good reviews ordered, got it in 2 days, charged up the batteries and put it right to work (make sure you order a micro SD card, it's not included. I've read other reviews saying don't use one higher than 64GB). Super easy to figure out the shooting modes and quality settings, and it comes with a ridiculous amount of helpful mounts and accessories. I slapped the waterproof case on and immediately had it in the pool. Hard to believe the quality for ~$60 USD. Very happy so far and will prob pick up a second one because it's so small and easy to use. See attached video for actual ""dry"" and underwater footage.*Edit: the quality is MUCH better than whatever Amazon's servers did to this video once I uploaded.",5,1,2019-7-8,1,1,0

"Everything works great picture quality is great stabilization is great. However they don't have a handlebar mount for motorcycles. They have one for bicycles but that one will not fit around motorcycle handlebars. I really did not want to mount it on my helmet because of wind lift, after a while wind lift will really start to hurt your neck. The adhesives do not last long especially when it gets hot out  so be careful  because they do not hold . That is my only complaint about this camera otherwise it's fantastic for the money.",4,1,2020-5-31,1,0,1
It is amazing to me that this product can be produced for such a low price and include so many accessories. Even if the most commonly desired accessory type for headwear is not included...It is also amazing to me that the device is incredibly and unnecessarily complicated because of the lack of a basic traditional menu layout. The user has to literally learn a new method of communication that requires pressing a series of buttons in a certain order to access basic menu functions such as ‘delete’ for a video clip. ‘Click this button once and then jump up and down on one foot and then press this button twice...’ Why? Not even close to being intuitive. Ridiculous.,2,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"I've given this thing a chance, and it's just a huge disappointment. The only reason this has positive reviews is because with some of the cameras, they offered free accessories to those who wrote positive reviews. But real talk? It's a lie. This camera takes TERRIBLE pictures and video even at the highest settings on a sunny day. I had cell phones 10 years ago that took better pictures. I am attaching a picture from yesterday. This was on a day with no clouds, and 90 degrees. THIS is the camera at it's best. The battery sucks, and barely lasts an hour. Even with both batteries, I couldn't record a 4-5 hour kayak trip. Just get a GoPro. Sure they cost more, but you do NOT want this camera.",2,1,2019-8-21,1,0,1
"I was pretty sceptical about this just because of the price, especially when others are $300+. I will say I bought a Hero 7 black right after this. Is there a difference in image quality between the two? Yes. If I need to buy a 3rd camera, what would it be? The Akaso. I was blown away by the image quality and the features of this one. Is it as good as the Hero? Close but no. I personally don't feel there is a 250 dollar difference though and this one is more than I will need. As far as durability, I haven't had either long enough to tell. I'm hoping for the best with both of them. I'm super happy with it and I see myself buy another one or two.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"I had a comparable GoPro Hero before this camera, and they are very similar. If you want the GoPro but can’t afford it, this is definitely the way to go.There are some small things that were annoying about this camera, like the way to download the contents via WiFi, since I don’t trust this camera at all with my phone info using their app that requires a concerning amount of permissions, but you pay less money in exchange for less privacy. This can be overrun if you have a memory card conversion to pull the data straight from the memory card out of the camera.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,1
"I bought this to make flying videos and I'm pretty happy with it, to the point that I ordered another one, though I decided to go one step up to the ""pro"" version.  The video quality at 1080p is as good as my older generation GoPro Session camera, though the colors may be a bit too vibrant.  I mounted it in its waterproof case because I didn't trust the other mount, which just clips to the camera, in a 100mph wind, and it muffled just enough of the wind noise to let the engine sound come through, I kind of like the effect.Only a few negatives:  When using the remote and you're in front of the camera, there's no way to tell if it's actually recording.  The blinking LED should be visible from the front.  There's no lanyard attachment on the camera, though there is one on the waterproof case.  It loses  the time and settings if you  take the battery out to change it, though you might be able to do it while plugged into the usb, I haven't tried that.",4,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
After 2 months with my AKASO action camera and I must say its pretty 50/50 and you get what you pay for its a $50 camera!!!!!..Came with alot of accessories 😑🤷🏿‍♂️,4,1,2020-2-28,1,0,1
"Bought this camera to find out what's going on in the water when fishing. The image quality is surprisingly good below the murky water of the Puget sound. The camera spent ~1h at various depth, some times as deep as 70ft. Not a single drop of water got inside the enclosure. The footage proved very valuable; I get to see a fish following the bait for a long distance before finally taking it in. Can't wait to go on more fishing trips with this thing!",5,1,2019-8-24,1,1,0
"My child wanted this camera to make youtube videos.  I thought it would be a great way to get him started without a large investment.  Camera was packaged well, and includes everything you need to get started, except a microSD card.  I read this in another review, so I made sure to order one along with the camera.  So far, this seems like a solid little camera, and it came with some nice mounts and a waterproof/protective case.  I charged the battery, and was taking video in about 30 min.  Settings are simple enough, and I got a nice manual in pdf form from a download link in the package.My only minor complaint, and for my own future knowledge, is that sound is not really recordable while in the full waterproof case.  But, that is easily resolved by using only the smaller mounting shell, if my kids want to record full audio.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Even after reading all the positive reviews I was skeptical, but for the price I figured it was worth a gamble. I wasn't disappointed. This camera is very lightweight but seems very solidly built. All the accessories are solidly made and sturdy (but I haven't tested the water resistance yet). It comes with two batteries and a charger, which is a big win. I strapped the camera to my head to capture my run down the mountain coaster at Holiday Valley in New York. The camera had no problems operating in the cold (unlike some other inexpensive cameras I've used) and the video quality was very good.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow up",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"The only thing I don't like about this is how it drains the battery. The battery only lasts about 1/2 an hour. I get a little more by attaching an external battery pack. The device indicates that it is charging but still quits after a while. Not good when taking a trip.The picture and sound are quite good. It has many features, such as single photos, stop action, etc. I can't think of any case where I'd be using the extra features.",3,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I purchased this camera to save some money and gave it a chance because of some of the reviews. I went on a trip and this camera kept freezing up and would not record anything. Sometimes the pictures would save but it was a real struggle. The picture quality was fair. I had a very frustrating time when the camera kept freezing up and failed to record any memories. After turning the camera off and on again it would family show that it was recording but to my surprise, it was not recording anything. Do not recommend this camera. Picture quality would be ok if it captured the memories I am trying to record . It will end up failing you and you will miss important memories. Do not buy.",1,1,2019-6-27,1,1,1
I wasn't successful in getting it to record. It would constantly freeze any time I would press the record button and the only way to get it going again was to pull the battery. I tried two different SD cards that were different brand( Samsung and Sandisk) and storage size. It still failed to work. I tried resetting it to factory settings and it would continue to freeze as soon as I'd push record. I had high expectations for this camera considering all of the good reviews. The manufacturer website doesn't offer much support.Update May 2019:,3,1,2018-8-14,1,1,0
"I bought the Akaso EK7000 about a week ago.  Received it along with a micro-SD card and a bag of mounting accessories a couple days later.  Very happy with my purchase.  My only complaint would be that the directions leave too much to the imagination.  However, after watching some 10-yr-old explain everything on a YouTube video, I think I've got a handle on things.  I bought this camera primarily for motorcycle and dashboard use, but I haven't tried that, yet.  I've taken photos and videos inside the house.  The remote control works fine.  The battery charger and batteries work.  I noticed that after leaving the camera on for an hour it got pretty hot.  Not sure if that will be a problem.  The case certainly seems waterproof, though I'm not likely to test it.  All the gadgets for mounting fit together nicely.  I was concerned that there's no sound when you playback a video.  However, when I moved the file to my tablet, the sound works and everything is OK.  Picture quality is fine.  I have yet to figure out the WiFi feature.  All things considered, I'm glad I bought the camera.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
this product is great got me out of a few traffic jams that I battled in court came with a lot of different parts and the pictures is great.  The quality of the hard waterproof casing seems to be in excellent shape but haven't tried it yet and I hope that I don't have to either since stuff like this gets destroyed when wet.  It also came with a few accessories that I also needed.  The set up is a breeze and easy to understand.  I can't wait to try this on my vacation that I had to now reschedule cause of the virus outbreak.,5,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera for my 11 year old son for Christmas. I thought he might like to attach it to his bike helmet when he rides around the neighborhood. He loves it!! He has so much fun recording his trips with his friends!! It's user friendly and he can do everything himself, from setting it up, hooking it to his bike or helmet, even downloading the video and pictures from his rides. He and his friends have also used it to make Youtube videos and projects for school This camera was the best (most useful) Christmas present he's ever gotten. The picture and video quality are great! We have a GoPro and this is very comparable, for less money! Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Amazing picture! See my hiking videos (2 min edited videos of various epic hikes) on earthy4life.com. Everything shot after 9/15th was shot with this camera. I could not be happier. I had a GoPro Hero 5+ Black or whichever edition was the more expensive version and I had endless problems for it. I paid like $500+ for that camera without any of the goodies. This one is so cheap and I'm getting better clarity and reliability. Plus, the battery life is better and the display on the back is key for getting the composition just right. Love this camera!!!",5,1,2017-9-21,1,3,0
"Absolutely terrific camera.  Image quality is great.  However, the best thing about this phone is the quality of the build.  I had the water proof case on it, but I drilled a hole on it to attach an external battery to it.  So, no longer water proof.  I strapped it to a near space balloon, it traveled to an altitude of 70,000 feet, landed in a lake, sat under water at a depth of 20 feet for over 30 minutes, and still worked after I recovered it and dryed it out.  I don't suggest submerging it under water, but the thing is a beast.  For the price, it's unbeatable.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"I had my reservations buying this camera, given the price, but the quality, hardiness and overall tech of the camera sold me!  It comes with several mounts and other handy gadgets, including a remote on a wristband to snap pics or video of things you may not want to get too close to.  Thankfully, an online manual is available because the info included is minimal and not easy to understand.  There are handy videos posted on YouTube by other consumers to further educate.  The waterproof housing is tough and nicely insulated.  The quality for the price is a great alternative to the much pricier camera that rhymes with ""Pro-Go"".",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0

"For beginners this might be a great camera, but for professional photographers on a budget.... not so much. The time and date, as well as the the file naming, resets every time i take the batter out. Makes it virtually impossible to put together timelapse footage because the files get completely out of order and you cant just have your computer do it because they have same names, times, and dates. INSANE!! Batteries don't last very long at all. You can only change exposure, and even then there is still some auto settings that i dont believe you can change, that again make it hard to get timelapse footage because each photo taken, the exposure seems to be changing. Even when i set it. Its been great in other ways, definitely water proof. All the accessories i purchased separately work well with the camera. A little disappointed in video quality. Overall though, not very impressed with this camera.",3,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera for my recent trip to Thailand. I was simply looking for a good underwater digital camera to document the snorkeling portion of the trip to share with my kids when I got back. That is exactly what I got. I wasn't looking for a GoPro. I didn't care about the 4K. I'm not a professional photographer, and never hoped my photos would be anything more than memories. I am currently organizing the photos of my trip (also used iPhone and Canon SLR), and I am quite pleased with what I came home with. Both underwater and above water photos and videos are great! The attached photo was from snorkeling. The water wasn't super clear, but from what other, more experienced, snorkelers said, it wasn't too bad either.  Note: don't go snorkeling around a Supermoon. The unusual tide patterns tend to mess with the clarity of water and underwater wildlife. Therefore, the photos weren't amazing--but that's not the cameras fault. The photos look much like it did with my own eyes. Second note: when transitioning between underwater and above, be sure to wipe the lens. Otherwise the water droplets left on the lens will distort the photos.Before purchasing, I was worried about some of the other reviews saying the batteries didn't last and videos were cut short, etc. I only took 1-2 minute videos at a time. Again, I was only recording fish swimming, etc. True, the batteries did not last all day, but I was okay with how long they lasted--especially since the camera came with two. There was only one part of the trip where I used both batteries while I was out and about. I'm okay with battery length. I never had any issues with recording video, but then I was conscientious about my battery life too--I never let my battery die while recording.",4,1,2019-2-25,1,1,1
"I received the camera today just in time to test it out before sunset. I had purchased a similarly priced action cam a few months back and well, there's a reason I bought a new one. All that to say, I have some experience with budget action cams. This thing is killer. The packaging much more closely resembles that of the big name in the category, and is very attractive. The components inside appear well made, fit snugly together,  and withstand some pretty good clamping in the form of included thumbscrews (a huge upgrade in itself from my previous action cam set). The removable battery and double supply in the box solve the other issue I had of running short on juice long before the day is over. Picture and video quality are great, not just for the price, but even against other ""pricy"" cams I've compared to. The direct link to my phone is also wonderful for sharing fun stuff with my friends and family, without having to wait for the long drive home and my slow computer. Now, I'm no techie or in any way qualified to evaluate some other features like camera stabilization, or aspect ratio, or any of the ""high tech"" stuff. But I am qualified to say it met and exceeded every expectation I had, made an ecxellent additon to my skiing kit, and allowed me to share my action vids faster and more hassle free than ever before. 10/10 would recommend.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

"This is a really good action cam. It comes with all the accessories you would need for an action camera. I bought this product to use as a camera to record my motorcycle trips, record driving backroads, and to wear on my person while working on the river. It’s small, compact and lightweight so if you wanted to a person could use this as a helmet cam and supplies come with the camera to mount it anywhere along with helmet mounts. I’ve haven’t honestly used it outdoors or underwater yet but the case the camera comes in is surely waterproof and wouldn’t have an issue in the elements nor underwater. The picture quality is awesome. It takes a wide range 4K ultra HD picture and video. It also comes with an extra battery and handy battery charger you could carry with you without the weight. I’m impressed with the battery life in the little package cause the small battery will last well over 40 mins of straight recording time and would last longer without recording a long video. Haven’t tired to take pictures but will be taking nice outdoor photos soon for Ultra HD pictures of nature. I’m impressed of this product so far and definitely will be testing it and so far I haven’t any issues. Pros is it comes with any mount you could imagine, the underwater case would withstand underwater and rainy weather action and the custom service (even thought I’ve never had to contact them) seem to be top notch and would be willing to help you out with any issues you would have but so far never had an issue yet. It’s an awesome little tough camera!",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0

The size of the camera is not what I expected and I'm not sure of that's good or bad. For people looking for action photos, I'm sure the small size would be great for mounting on helmets or bikes or other fun and daring activities...me on the other hand, I'm worried about dropping this at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea. 😨Since I have yet to use it, all I can give are my first impressions.",4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,1

I have it on the way back of my helmet with straps that came with it. I can't get the straps much tighter, but they really are just a backup incase the adhesive gives. While taking these photos, I looked at the adhesive and there are 0 gaps on it! This will survive the highway! But for the inexpensive cost of 2/3yr insurance that covers accidental damage, it is a no brainer. In 3 yrs i'm sure I'll break it or have it knocked of my head.Would/Have recommended to a friend.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,1
"The Akaso EK7000 action camera is probably one of the best ""bang for your buck"" camera on the market. It has the capacity to shoot at 4K at around 22 maybe 25 FPS. Which is not THAT bad. Personally 1080p at 60 FPS is just fine for me. Right now I have fiddled with the camera enough to say its pretty decent. It does have a wide camera lens which views at about 170 degrees which covers a good percentage of the area. At a cost of having a fish eyed style perspective. Perfect for action events. It does come with your standard accessories and even an extra battery. I would recommend getting yourself extra camera accessories because it comes with your standard stuff. No head strap, no car stand, or chest harness. So far I am pleased with this camera and so far I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. This is definitely not a Go Pro. Under 100 dollars I am not complaining.",4,1,2017-2-2,1,3,0

This is such an great action camera we bought one for my brother to film his outdoor adventures to post to Bro Ru and shortly will buy one for my dad. Thank you Akaso. I would never have been able to continue to try and build my subscriber base with great videos had I not come across your product while doing research.

"I own a GoPro but purchased this camera to test it out for a trip to Bora Bora where I planned to do a lot of underwater activities. After going through a lot of my vacation photos, I noticed that there’s a timestamp (an inaccurate one) on all of my photos and videos with no way to remove it once the photo’s been taken. It boggles my mind that the camera’s factory setting is to have a time stamp—who would want one right smack dab on their beautiful travel photos and videos? Even worse, photos are blurry and low-res, practically unusable. Videos are slightly better (especially underwater), but still low-res, MUCH more grainy compared to videos and photos on my GoPro during a similar trip. The positive reviews about this camera really confuse me, but if you haven’t owned a GoPro yet or a higher-quality camera, I can see how this one might appear to be a good choice. But if you have the money and can splurge on a camera that produces better pics and videos, it’s worth it. Those are once-in-a-lifetime memories and you don’t want to remember them via grainy photos where you can barely make out the subjects. Terribly unhappy with this product.",1,1,2019-5-4,1,1,0

Didn't really get the chance to use the camera as much as I wanted, but the few images and videos I did get were pretty neat. Quality of photos and videos are nice. Camera was easy enough to figure out how to work. I haven't encountered any issues so far. Definitely like that there are 2 batteries for this camera, so I can swap out when needed. Will definitely have to keep playing with this camera in other settings, just for fun.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"We did our checking and per the reviews this was the one. The pics on land were good and the snorkeling were fine. However, under water the pics were terrible. We bought this camera ( 2 of them) for Cozumel for our SCUBA certification. We were so disappointed in the lack of quality. We took over 300 pictures and none of them our worth saving. We will never get this opportunity back but we are looking for a better camera for the next time.",1,1,2019-9-22,1,1,1
Ok little camera.. does what it says it will do. I bought it for a motorcycle trip.  Rode 4hrs in the rain no problem. Worked great.  Battery only last 1hr-1 1/2. So it sucked because I couldn't plug in a constant power source because of the protective case. Editing features are not that great. Had to download an app to edit. The app that you download with the camera is useless as far as I cam tell.  But the app does have one plus as you can see your videos on your phone.If you want a basic knockoff go pro this works fine. But my buddy had a real high end gopro. No protective waterproof case needed. And better features.  If you have the money go for it. If not this little camera works fine.,4,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"Thought about going the cheaper route since I own every GoPro but it’s starting to get hard to keep up with them because they are coming out with new ones every few months it seems. This is not the best product but for the price I guess it’s good. The image stabilizer in this device is horrid, seems like the only thing it’s good for is pictures. It is not meant to be an action camera because of the image stabilization is lacking. Will not buy one of these again, but good for beginners and those who don’t have the $ for a GoPro",2,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"THIS IS THE MOST DETAILED AND HONEST REVIEW IN THE WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM!!! TRUST EVERYTHING I SAY! I DID NOT GET A DEFECTED ONE! Okay, I bet everyone that is reading my review right now, came to this product because of the 4 star 5,000+ reviews this camera has. Well, those that gave the camera 5 stars have really low expectations and don't know what a good action camera is. This is as bootleg and cheap of an alternate GoPro as it gets. You know what, I'm gonna just jump right into the pros and cons:PROS:",3,1,2017-11-28,1,8,0
"Bought this camera for action shots in the water during vacation. Took it underwater (maybe 3ft) in the ocean and on a waterslide multiple times. Included waterproof case works perfect, never had any fogging or leakage issues. The video quality turned out fine, even in varying light levels.  The only thing lacking is the audio, which I know in a waterproof case is expecting a lot, but even out of the case the recorded audio is extremely quiet.  Overall, with all of the mounting hardware and accessories included, you cannot go wrong at this price point!",4,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
I had this camera for a couple of months and at first it worked great taking nice quality video with reasonably good sound too.  Then it started having a problem where it SEEMED to be recording video but it was not.  This caused me problems on two separate occasions where it showed that it was recording but it didn't.  It just went into the trash.Akaso customer service read my review and took care of me by issuing a refund!  I'm astounded.  In the meantime I purchased the EK7000 Pro version which I like very much and I feel is worth the extra money over the base model.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
"This camera far exceeded my expectations for the price that it comes at.  I would say for the price point this is the best sports action camera per dollar.  It comes with loads of accessories,  2 batteries,  and a remote control wristband where you can record/take pictures from.  The picture is stunning considering it is coming from a sub $100 camera. I definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking to get into an action camera without the big price.I don't have any cons for this device,  the only thing I can think of is an sdhc card is needed before anything can be recorded but that was expected already.  I only write that as I am sure some will buy it and not realize they need a card as well.  So figured I'd put that in the review so if someone is planning on buying it,  they know they need to get one.",5,1,2016-12-31,1,1,0
"Camera works fine.. Just using it in case someone hits me on my bike. However, the battery life is rather small.. Only around 15-30 minutes. Don't know exactly how long since I'm paying attention to the road instead of the camera. However, the I changed the settings to disable features and reduce quality of the image so hopefully it can last longer. Satisfied but if it doesn't last longer, I'll look into investing in larger capacity batteries that'll fitEdit:",5,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0
"For the price you can not best it. I call this little thing my GoPro wannabe.  With the water proof case on it does get to a point where it gets hot and fogs up.  I tried recording in 4k but the battery dies way too fast.  It gets the job done. I would recommend this camera for children or teens as a gift or for use on your pets.  I have told coworkers about how much I bought it for and where I got it, they are impressed and bought some as well. I am really curious if I would have bought the top end camera with this company on how much better it would be. I plan on buying more. One for our dog and cat, one for our 8 year old daughter and one for my husband and I.  Also I am extremely impressed with all of the accessories that came with it plus a 65gb SD card.  You can't beat it for the price.  There are some accessories that I have no clue how to mount to the camera so it would be nice to have instructions on how to install each of them.  Thanks for making this affordable product, it is worth the money which is why I have it 5 stars, it is nice to not be scammed out of hundreds of dollars only to have a device that would be out of date a few years later.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
Awesome camera! We bought this for our honeymoon to Hawaii and were so happy with it! Used it snorkelling and at some waterfalls; waterproof case worked like a charm. The case arrived damaged and they replaced it which was nice! The pictures are real crisp and clear. Also took this to Moab and used some of the action attachments. We did some offroading in our jeep and the windshield attachment worked great! It never fell off and provided a really nice smooth video despite the bumpy road. Have owned it 6 months now still love it still working great!Couple notes:,5,1,2018-7-20,1,0,0
"Final Revision... After a month and a half, and 4 or 5 uses of my Akasotech Camera I am completely satisfied.  The replacement camera has preformed perfectly and is pretty easy to use.  If I could give 4.5 starts I would but because thats not an option I've given it 4 starts because the original camera ultimately didn't work.Revised review... After my initial review included below I was contacted by an Akaso representative and provided w a nee camera, Ive only had a few minutes behind it so far but everything seems to be working fine.  Because my initial camera worked well in the beginning before stopping I will continue to use and create a final review in the coming months.",4,1,2018-5-29,1,0,0
"Bought this camera for my son. He wanted to start making videos, and I didn't want to spend a fortune on a hobby that lasted a week. This little gem does everything he wants to do. It comes with enough accessories to handle most anything. I am no techie, so I was no expert on cameras, last videos i made was when everyone had VCR's, but just watching him use it, It's easier then I thought and I have even started making videos of fishing trips, trips to the beach, deer wandering through my yard, etc. One other thing I have used it for, is working on equipment I am not familiar with, taking a picture in the past isn't as good as a video when you can't remember where that part went. All things considered, this was a great deal and i am thinking about getting the next model up, who knows, I could be the next big YouTube star . Great camera for the money!",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"I am old enough to remember my uncle holding his expensive Camcorder on his shoulder.  It was huge, clunky, and needed to be plugged in.  When we were expecting our first child, we thought we hit it out of the park buying a GoPro Hero3. For $300-$400, you got a great camera.  The GoPro's battery didn't last long and it did not have an LCD screen in the back, so you had to guess at what you were recording. Anyway, 5 years later the GoPro has died.So I read the reviews and decided to buy the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder. I almost didn't buy it because I could not wrap my head around how a camera can be so cheap ($52.99 with taxes) and provide so many different features and accessories. I have been playing with this camera for a few days now and it works great. It has a longer battery life, came with 2 batteries, has an LCD screen, comes with a waterproof case, and so much more.  It does not come with a Micro SD, but I took my old one out from my GroPro and I'm good to go.  Therefore, this may be my best purchase or value purchase of the year.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
I bought it for my  9-yea my son. It came with lots of accessories which is a huge plus. The remote is handy. However the video keeps freezing when shooting at 4K mode. Video stabilization is not close to GoPro.  For 43$ I will keep it as picture model and 1080p video still work. One thing I really loathe is that the seller offers free  accessories in change for positive reviews. I have to admit that the free gifts are very attempting. I was wondering how many of 10+k reviews are actually honest reviews. This is nothing but bribery. Amazon should do something to stop this nonsense!,2,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Received Wednesday and took some time to play with it. Instructions are basic; it's not hard to figure out. Threw it on my car for a pov test run, and I'm impressed. Picture is great. Lots of accessories included, so don't buy add ons until you get it. It's light, case feels good- haven't gone underwater yet, but will eventually with no fears. I like the wifi connection. It's pretty easy, and it allows you to immediately download to your phone and begin editing or posting- I'm on an iPhone, so not sure how it would be on another format, but I assume there'll be no issues. Long and short, if you want an action cam without the big dollar price tag, give this one a try. I've seen big brand footage, and I'd put this up against it without concern.",5,1,2017-8-20,1,1,0
"Value for the money, this can’t be beat. It doesn’t have exactly the same quality as a brand name camera 10x the cost, but I’ve used this camera while snorkeling (waterproof case works perfectly) and got really nice results.

"I bought this as a starter / beginners ""action"" camera and couldn't be happier.  For the price, the picture quality matches.  So far i have only used as a dash-cam (window mount: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NJVC2QC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to test it out till next summer when i can take the jeep out on the trail.  I CAN NOT wait!**Only complaint i have is that i cannot seem to get it to fit all the way into the other mount if i don't want it in the waterproof case (see pictures) (I've tried flipping it both ways, same end result)",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,1
"I primarily use this camera when I ride. I have taken it in my city and rural area rides, and it has proven to be a quality camera that can sustain fast-moving images. Video Quality is great, and the external memory, it is very easy to swap memory cards. Also, I really like the remote control feature that I come with, which you can wear on your wrist or attach it elsewhere to quickly turn start/stop recording or take a picture. Comes with the accessories that you would need to mount this little camera on your bike.",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,1

"This camera does what it does exceptionally well for the price.  I purchased this camera so that I could take some video's of my son and I skiing and it accomplished that task very well.  The battery life is around two hours of moderate use, but since they ship you two batteries, swapping the two gives decent coverage.  They provide all of mounts that you could need, of which I have only used the helmet mount, but it worked perfectly.  While the camera doesn't have some of the features of more expensive models (i.e. image stabilization, webcam support, etc...) it does exactly what I needed it to do, at a great price point.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"I got this camera for my son.  For the price, I wasn't too worried about it being ruined as compared to more expensive cameras.  It came with everything he needed to get up and running.  The video quality is awesome and can be easily compared to that of your iPhone or better.  Sound quality is great even in the waterproof case.  We have used it both fresh and salt water without any issues with the provided case.  Battery run time seems reasonable, we haven't run it out during an adventure and there are two batteries provided.  10/10 would buy again.",5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
The camera came in a well constructed protective box. The box was tough and well sealed. In fact it was a little hard to get into to extract the camera.After the initial extraction it was necessary to charge the batteries and purchase an SD card. No problem.,4,1,2018-9-22,1,0,0
"My wife bought this camera to use while swimming open water. For her, the camera performed as expected: the angle of view is very wide, and the images were in focus. Sound is somewhat muffled when the camera is sealed inside the waterproof case, though nearby conversation is still understandable. The directions that come with the camera are very brief, however there are MANY detailed tutorials online, which were useful in setting up & identifying all of the attachments that come with it. Attached video is at a local river. The camera was mounted to her safe swim buoy, about 5-6 inches above the waterline. (she also wants me to add: don't blame the camera for her lack of skill in using it!)",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,1
"My daughter wanted a waterproof camera. She's only 11 so I wasn't spending $300 on a GoPro. I didn't even know these GoPro ripoffs existed. I figured for $60 how bad could it be, she's only 11, t'll be fine. It is way better than fine. It has more features than my 2 year old GoPro, the video quality seems to be just as good, if not better, and the build quality seems great. If that wasn't enough, the remote is actually a fantastic feature to not have to mess with the camera itself to start and stop video once you have it in the right position.I can't imagine you being disappointed with this camera at $300. At $60 it is just ridiculous.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

The contact points on the unit broke off when I re-installed the battery gingerly... Totally uselessUpdate.  Akaso earned some more stars.  I was recently contacted by Akaso and was offered a free replacement camera.  This was impressive because I purchased it back in 2017.  Sure enough, the camera arrived and is charging and functioning correctly.  I have only shot a couple of test videos so far, but will be using it in the near future.

"This is my third action-based camera. The first two were both Go Pros; lost one to the Ocean and one to a breakup. Overall the picture quality is on par if not better, the sound isn't quite as good with the waterproof case on, but with it off it isn't noticeable. (makes no difference if you use an external microphone). The App that connects the camera to the phone is surprisingly good, but not necessary. This is essentially a stripped-down go pro, great camera, lesser microphone cheaper battery lock-in system. For the price this is great! would buy again (hopefully wont loose this one)",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I bought this for one main reason and that it to record how I slowly improve on my snow skiing adventuress (still beginner). When I received the package and opened it, I was first impressed with the array of different mounting accessories it came with and the camera is very compact also! The best way I preferred was to mount to the camera to my ski helmet, which was easy using the sticky back mount and a ty-wrap for back-up. I skied for almost two weeks (including crashing) with no helmet mounting issues. The camera itself is not water proof, so it mounts inside a waterproof clear plastic case that seals everything up. The audio will be muffled while inside the waterproof case, but used as a regular camera, audio is adequate. The camera uses an external memory SD card to record video and phone app to interact with the camera-which I both liked. The external SD card removes and plugs into laptop for faster downloads of all day action rather than using wireless download from app. Shorter video (10 min or less) download fairly quickly). It comes with a wrist mounted push-button for start/stop of recording, but mostly left the camera recording the whole time because I sometimes got exited on beginning of ski runs and forgot to record some runs (just edit videos on computer when got home later). It comes with (2) rechargeable batteries, which easily last a half day of skiing per battery. I just change batteries at the ski lodge when I take lunch break; it's also a fun time to review video from the phone.The main negative (1 star remove) was there appeared to be a small rattling recorded in the audio while skiing with the camera mounted on my helmet. I've troubleshooted this to be inside the camera (including the batt and SD card removed). No big deal, I edited my videos to remove the camera audio and overplayed with my favorite rock songs any way. This is a great entry level camera for action recording for the price-very hard to beat!",4,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
I wanted to get something similar to a gopro for my 9 year old that wasn't $300. I stumbled across the EK7000 and at first I couldn't believe the price but after watching several reviews on youtube I pulled the trigger.Wow what a great deal! The image quality is fantastic and the video's are smooth and crisp. I still can't believe it was under 50 bucks. We've taken it underwater several times and the image quality remains fantastic. This is a great camera for a young up and coming youtuber or anyway that doesn't want to spend $300 for an action camera!,1,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"This camera is a sound investment if you don’t wanna spend $500+ on a device that has almost the same quality. The package comes with all the accessories you’ll need to mount it anywhere. Voice recording is always loud and clear. A single battery can last about 2+ hours of continuous recording. Attached photos are the unit itself and some screenshots I took from a 1080p recording at a biker rally this morning. I haven’t tried 4K yet but I’m sure it would be significantly better, but  also requires more power of course. If you are on a budget but still want a solid travel camera, this is it!",5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,1
"I wanted something to record movies while kayaking and did not want to spend a lot of money on a GoPro.  First the good.  I started off by experimenting around with photos and movies and find the quality to be pretty good for such an inexpensive camera.  Mind you, I do not own and have never owned a GoPro so I can't make a comparison to that.  Things that I found frustrating is the battery compartment cover once removed to install the battery just does not want to fit flush nor does it appear to want to stay in place.  I fiddled with it for around 30 tries and it still does not seem to want to sit flush again.  Also, there is a lack of good instructions that come even with the downloaded user manual.  To that I say, thank goodness for YouTube as there were some excellent tutorials there on several things that were either not addressed in the users manual or the information was insufficient.  The camera seemed to ""lock up"" on me at one point and none of the buttons worked so I just removed the battery to re-set the camera.  There is a dizzying array of mounts and again, not really clear instructions on using them.  Right now I am trying to figure out ways to securely attach the camera to my kayak.  I also plan to experiment around with attaching to caps and my kayak paddle.  Time will tell once I get that figured out and actually try it on the water.",4,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
"After playing with the EK7000 for a while, I can say that this is one of the better low-cost GoPro competitors. It’s one of the GoPro competitors that has taken off in popularity, and after playing with it for a while I can see why. It shoots 4K video (at 25fps), takes 12MP still photos, comes with a waterproof housing, and uses the same mounting system. It’s even packaged the same way a GoPro is packaged, with the distinctive clear perspex bubble on top. But it’s simpler to use. And it’s much cheaper.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
I have to start off by saying I wish they would have included a user manual. The QR code to go to the manual is not overly helpful. The hard plastic stand for the camera didn't come with any instructions. It was pretty difficult to get off. I finally was able to though. I like that it comes already in the waterproof case and its great with all of the accessories. Its a bit annoying that they don't include a cube to plug in. The only other thing that I would have liked to see is a  bag to hold all the goodies. The option to wear a clicker for videos and photos is awesome. All in all I am very excited.,4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera for my husband to use while scuba diving.  The camera is very compact, came with a lot of accessories and 2 batteries.  I added a separate memory card as recommended.  While he has not used it for scuba diving yet, we have used it biking, kayaking and just walking around.  The pictures have been great.  The camera is easy to use.  The most complicated part is figuring out all the attachments.  Looking forward to many pictures and videos we would not have been able to capture with our phones.  Extremely happy with our purchase.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0

"Got this Camera delivered today and i was super excited to use it right away, First opening the box i can see it was neatly packaged, Inside the box came with some various mounts which is always needed for recording depending  on what you do, I play Airsoft, ride mountain bikes and go hiking and road trips often and like to record my adventures, From what i have noticed the Picture/video Quality is stunning way better then i thought it would be, The wide angle lens makes big area captures a breeze as well as the options to change what video size you want, 4K/1080/720 and FPS limits aso comes with a wrist remote for easy push and go waterproof too, One cool thing i noticed was the box has a flat plastic mount built onto it which the cam was mounted on which will make a awesome stand for itOne thing i can say is navigating between menus for Video/Picture/View Recording/picture was a bit tricky as i did know how to exit the menu from it, instead i would just restart the camera, also my phone with the WIFI did not seem it wanted to connect to it on the app. Im sure it is a simple thing ill ask about to find out but does not effect me using this awesome camera",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"This is a great little action cam for the money, especially when you consider that it comes with several attachments included and TWO batteries!  I use it for recording bicycle rides and hiking trips.  The only downside is that the battery life is only about an hour and a half on a full charge, but I don't know how that compares to other action cams.  And the batteries are small, you can carry one in a small pocket and change it out for another 90 minutes or so of filming.  For the $50 I paid for this, a real bargain in my opinion.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0

"For this price, this is a very very good deal. The picture quality aren’t the best but it’s very good for this camera. The video quality is great. The only thing I didn’t like that the camera time resets after every time you change the battery. Which makes the whole idea of putting time stamps completely useless. This happened when I tried to do time lapse but because of this issue It messed up all the file names and I had to just delete all the files. Other than that it’s fine. Got it out under the rain the same day i got it. I paid about $100 to get this camera, micro sd and more accessories which is waaaay better than paying $500 to get the same thing with gopro. So yeah.",4,1,2017-12-2,1,1,0

I was still somewhat hesitant as I purchased because it seemed too good to be true to have a camera that goes underwater and come with so many accessories.  I was certain the quality wouldn't be very good.  I was wrong and SO pleasantly surprised!  I have used this in the ocean, the pool, and for a lot of outdoor video taping.  For what you're getting for the price it is definitely worth it!  I uploaded a video that I'm sure will be lesser quality once on Amazon, but is very clear on my computer.  I'm so excited to take this on vacation!",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"I bought this to use on my road bike.  Thought it would be fun to get some pictures and videos during my rides.  At some point I would also like to purchase a dog harness as well.  The price and the reviews were good, and I did not want to spend GoPro money for an action camera.  I've only used it on one ride so far and the conditions were too windy - - up to 20mph - - to play around with it too much and be safe at the same time.  Having said that the video came out as I expected.  I used the remote wristband to operate it. I was able to download and use the app but I didn't find it useful for my needs.  The manual that comes with it is not very detailed. YouTube had plenty of helpful videos.  The bike mount that came with it did not fit and I did buy a GoPro bike mount instead.  I also purchased the additional insurance.  $5.75 for three years and I've never had any issues with Square Trade before and hopefully I won't ever need to use it.",4,1,2018-3-27,1,0,1
"This one works for fine for me till now, I honestly said I didn't do much recording so don't take my opinion too serious this time.  I only turns on this as a 1080P camera cause too many people claim the 4K quality is not good.  So I didn't ever test that out.But As for the normal 1080P use, this is a great one, with many amenities, 2 battery and a protection case.",4,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"I was shocked at how poor the video quality of this camera is. To describe it as a 4K camera brings, in my view at least, expectations of high video quality. I tried the camera in all of the various settings (4K, 2K, 1080P) and found the quality equally bad with them all. Even 1080P did not come close to quality I have on other similar priced cameras. What is the point of 4K if the video is blocky, fuzzy, does not handle various light situation well and shows no detail. Bottom line is this that this camera has a low quality CMOS sensor and will not produce quality video at any setting.On the positive side, the packaging is professional, the wide array of adaptors and cases are nice, the wifi work good for me (although it was a very short test), function of the camera is pretty easy if you follow the manual. But all that really doesn't matter with such poor quality. I will be returning.",1,1,2019-9-2,1,1,0
"This is a nice all around camera for the price. I purchased this for my 12 year old to use around the house and vacation.  He opened the box and had it all figured out before I even got home from work!  Easy to operate and control. It does not come with the SD card so you will need to have one on hand.  He has already bolted it to his go cart and bike for some footage.  I like that it is light and compact.  It comes with a bunch of accessories to use.  I like the case that it comes in.  Some things that I can overlook are the fact that the sound quality is not great with the case on. If you have in out of the case, it is way better.  Since we are planning on taking it on a fishing trip, we really won't need the sound as we will make a video out of our whole week.  Overall, it beats paying hundreds of dollars for a name brand.  This will be a good learner for us and if we really enjoy it, we may upgrade in the future.",4,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Updating my review, I decided to give AKASO another shot. This camera works well and the wifi connects well. Battery is good and it exceeded the expectations, it comes with 2 batteries and a charger. The battery is as good or better than my gopro camera battery. The video quality is good as well and the camera comes with lots of mounts, such as bicycle mount which is the main purpose of this camera (I record my rides). I definitely recommend this camera.Attached pictures showing the camera setup with bicycle mount and box full of mounts and remote control.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,1
"I am a 55yo female that had been looking at purchasing a ""action camera"" for a while. Mostly to use while on vacation, may use as a bird feeder cam. Had this camera in my cart for some time and pulled the trigger when the price dropped to $43.00. The waterproof case seems quite sturdy - have not tried it yet.  Have not figured out all of the accessories, will most likely only use a few, but nice that they are included. The camera itself is quite small and light - the only thing that seems low quality is the battery door, feels like it might break at some point but so far so good. The video is pretty good - not true 4k, but I am no professional and it looks great for my purpose. Price point is amazing for what you get.  If it lasts me a couple of years - I would purchase again.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I don't have any issue with the camera by itself, but I have issues with the battery life.  Batteries last maybe an hour (sometimes more, sometimes less).  You don't know when the battery is going to die, so after about 45 minutes, you have to keep taking it off and checking.When you do replace the battery, you have to reset the date and time.  This requires lots of clicking.  It's enough work to change out the battery every hour, but the last thing I want to do is sit for a minute each hour and reset things.",2,1,2018-11-21,1,0,0
"This device comes with enough accessories to strap it to just about any body part you can think of - I however just wanted it as a cheap and effective webcam. It works! It costs less than half what a webcam costs right now after the price gouging, err correction. I liked it so much for that purpose I bought one for a friend so we could chat on video.Someay I might go outside and strap this thing to myself and fall down a mountain, or scuba to Atlantis  - for today,  I will shelter in place and admire how silly I look on my rather thrifty webcam.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"This product is perfect for those who want the benefits of a GoPro but don’t exactly have GoPro money. The quality of the camera is very nice. The main reason I purchased this was for a documentary that I’m filming, to get some cool shots. It was worth it, I got to go to the beach and use it without worrying about it getting damaged and I even put it on my bike.The only downside of this product is that there are a lot of pieces that come with it and was confusing at first. However the app that you can get with it was helpful in explaining how to assemble the pieces and what they were used for.",4,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"For the price you definitely cant go wrong with this camera set up. Definitely worth buying to see if you like it before purchasing a much more expensive option. No issues as of yet, have had it for a little under a month and its very easy to set up and use. Haven't used it under water since its winter here, but definitely will be going to try it in the spring. The remote wrist option comes in very handy as well. All the accessories are great, I keep it in a small makeup bag and put it in my camera bag.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"We bought this for my husband and son to take on a future Boy Scout canoe trip, so they can take pictures on the water and not risk a cell phone or my 35mm camera. Our son and one daughter tested it out and it takes surprisingly good pictures and videos with as small as it is. The field of view is amazing. We haven't tested the waterproof/water resistance, yet, but the case looks like it will work well. They did take pictures with it on, and they still looked pretty good.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I've been looking for a small, reliable and affordable action cameras for my racing bike and motorcycle. This kit comes with all accessories that I need to mount the camera on my racing bike or on my motorcycle. It's kind of killing two birds with one stone! Easily setup and operated with good instructions! There's also a 2nd battery and a charging cradle in the package and some more free courtesy accessories are on the way from the vendor. It's a great deal! I have not tried the water resistance feature yet but I believe it should work by my looking at the rigid construction of the waterproof case!",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,1
"I purchased this action camera specifically for an island vacation, wanting something to be able to capture something words couldn’t. Ive never purchased an action camera before and don’t know too much about them. Ive read reviews and watched YouTube videos about this product to try and make somewhat of an educated purchase. You will find people who love it and those who are not impressed comparing it to a more popular brand. In the pictures I have posted, you can see that it works better than expected. The picture and video quality is great, at least for me anyway. I took it through some serious off road hiking trails (safe in the waterproof casing always) and against some serious ocean waves. It held up against everything and having the two batteries was more than sufficient. If you’re not looking to spend a lot of money and want good quality, this camera great. There was only one minor back-draw and that was that sometimes in the ocean the inside of the waterproof casing would fog up slightly. Water did not get in or to the camera but just some condensation in the  somehow. This camera was better than I expected and the best purchase I made preparing for our vacation.",5,1,2019-6-9,1,0,1
I really love my Akaso EK 7000 Camera.  For me the camera performs true to it's amazing specifications.  Ease of use and simple operating controls make for a pleasurable filming experience.  For my money the performance far exceeds the affordable cost compared to other brands of action cameras.  With those higher dollar camcorders I think a person pays a lot for the name.  I wanted to mention the included sturdy and well designed waterproof enclosure as well. It also comes with many handy mounting accessories.  With the EK 7000 you pay a small price for great workmanship and a reliable high quality device.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.,5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Just got this delivered today and took it for a dirt bike trail ride. I'm coming off an old Contour gps which was easy to turn on and go, but has seen better days. After reviewing some new action cameras, I couldn't justify the cost GoPro wants when every time I crash on my dirt bike I risk loosing a ton of money. Saw the great reviews and the low cost of entry and said I have nothing to loose. Used it for 2 hours this morning on a trail ride from my house. Got it all connected to my phone using the app which was easy enough, hit record, and went off down the trail. Picture turned out awesome, especially when compared to my contour. Color is much better, sound of my exhaust is more muted with the open back case so it's not as overwhelming, and battery life was excellent. Had no trouble after hitting the dirt several times with the camera. After I edit the video I'll post it to youtube and anyone that sees my old videos compared to this will immediately notice the upgrade. For the price, it can't be beat, I'm stoked. I'll update after I take it mountain biking and snowboarding, especially snowboarding as I go later in the evening and will be able to see how the late evening light and video compare.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Image quality and video quality are both fantastic. Stable, plenty of mounting options and accessories in the setup so you can use it on just about anything. My one and only gripe is that the built in microphone is subpar at best and does not come with any capability of connecting an external mic (for uses like recording music cover videos). With that being said, if you are not doing any sort of music video shooting, or at least not a lot, THIS IS YOUR CAMERA. makes for a great dash cam as well, which is what I decided to use it as.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,1
"We purchased this camera to take on our trip to South Africa. It was a last minute idea, and it arrived just days before be departed. Even though we had a limited time to explore the cameras options and features, we were able, with little effort, to get the camera up and operational. We completed the accessory package by adding a much needed selfie-stick,  which  made taking still shots and videos a breeze. We have yet to take any underwater video, but have exposed the camera to damp applications(water falls), and it performed perfectly. The only reason I gave this a less than perfect rating was that the battery life (in video mode) was a little less than spectacular. The other issue is that this camera only has Wifi capability. It would have been great with Bluetooth for areas with limited Wifi access.  All in all for the price & features, this camera was a great purchase!",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
I love this camera. I purchased this camera on amazon as a replacement for another camera (different brand) that wouldn’t even turn on. This one happened to be a lightening deal so I decided to buy it. I’m so glad that I did. My husband loves it and has it mounted to his helmet when he rides his OneWheel. The videos are really good. It recently came in handy after someone nearly hit him and we were able to give footage to the police. I’d definitely purchase this one again if I ever needed to.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"I got the camera for the feature of taking photos with the wrist band. I set up the camera to take photos of my proposal to my girlfriend. Worked like a charm. I was got the selfie stick to go with is and pretended to take scenic photos with the sunset and used the wristband to take photos every step of the way. Worked great, captured every moment. Have not tested the waterproof ability yet, but the casing does appear secure. The battery life is pretty long. I haven't used the camera for extended periods of time yet, but I've only needed to charge the battery once. The app feature has given me trouble and somehow connecting the camera to wifi has still been an issue for me. However, it hasn't stopped me from taking photos and videos and uploading them onto the computer. Definitely recommend the camera for a more affordable option of sports action cameras. Plan to take it on all future vacations.",5,1,2019-8-12,1,1,0
"Impressive little camera for the price, loaded with video and still photo features in a compact size.  More impressive was the included accessories, including waterproof case, 6 mounts, 2 batteries plus charger, battery operated remote (battery included) numerous straps, handlebar mount and more.Initial test video provided clear, color accurate views with minor vibration (which could have been the result of my using a non-recommended mount set-up (helps to read the manual).

so it apparently won't take an sd card bigger than 32gb. how do i know this? not from anything that it said on the product page or in the user manual. i learn it from a video on youtube explaining all the stuff about this camera that no one bothered to write anywhere. the terrible manual and support for this camera explains why it's so cheap. i'm not very happy since my SD card is too large and i cannot use this camera until i get a smaller one.,1,1,2019-8-3,1,2,0

"OK, so this is the first sports camera we've ever purchased. I didn't want to spend hundreds for a name brand GoPro when there are tons of equally better options out there. For the price, this is really great! It feels pretty durable and it comes with a ton of accessories. So far in playing with it, I know I'm going to love it. We've played with other people's GoPro's and I really don't see a difference at all between this. I would save your hard earned $$ and not buy a name brand and go with this! Amazon has a great return policy if you were to not like it, so what do you have to lose? I am very pleased with my purchase! I'm so excited to use it on our upcoming vacation!I also purchased the extra batteries and charger. For the price, it's definitely worth it to have a total of 4 batteries.",5,1,2018-8-10,1,0,0
"It's not going to cook you supper or walk your dog, but you could clip this little bugger onto your dog and get some pretty great footage! The still camera footage is so/so, but my mom wants something little she can strap to her walker and get some action shots of her walks around the block and of Lake Michigan without breaking the bank. At less than $50, you can't ask for much more. This thing has a zillion attachments and if Mom ever decided she needs to try parasailing, it comes with a waterproof case. Slick!",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"I bought this camera to use as a dashcam for my motorcycle. An answered question stated that it can. The problem is that you have to start it for every trip rather than having it start automatically when power is restored from the motorcycle. So yes, it can be used as a dashcam, but it is very inconvenient. The quality of the video is good, but lacking auto power on, it's worthless to me.",4,1,2019-6-8,1,1,0
"Got this camera for my cancun vacation that I went on during the christmas break last winter and I am thoroughly impressed. For the price of the camera, i wasn't expecting great shots like the gopro but the video quality and picture quality is way better than expected ! there's a bunch of different gear that comes with it that's nice and the water seal component is very sturdy.the only thing i didn't like about the camera is that the date is incorrect (something i can probably fix but couldn't get to as of yet) and for some reason, when i was using the camera on the trip in the water case that it comes with, some how mid- way (never touching the battery component), the battery had came out and i had no idea until i realized physically by opening on the compartment and seeing the battery had some how fallen out. missed some great footage opportunity but overall, the rest of the trip it was fine. missing one battery now so i'm most likely going to have to buy another pack because one battery is not enough for a trip (it'll last me maybe 2 -3 hour max).",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says ""if you replace the battery, date and time will reset"". WT???????",1,1,2019-12-26,1,1,0
"While the camera itself performed fine, although a little unstable, my rating is because of the mounting hardware.  I mounted it on my motorcycle and rode about 3 times - and it broke.  The mounting hardware just snapped.  No camera now....couldn't recover it after going 70 mph and lots of traffic.  :(Updated: Initially reached out to my warranty via Assurion who refused to help. I contacted the seller and was originally told there was nothing they could do. However, a few days later someone from the company reached out and we were able to come to an agreement and they refunded the amount of the camera.  I did buy another model and mounted it on my motorcycle. So far it's performed well.",4,1,2020-5-17,1,0,1
"Great action camera for the price! Is this as good as a GoPro? Of course not. However, you are paying 25% of the price and getting a camera that provides about 90% the video quality of a GoPro. I'd say this is a good trade off.The video quality of the EK7000 is very good. The contrast is a bit high, which may cause details in the shadows to be a but muddled, but this is not really noticeable in an ""action video"". The field of view is very good, but it does create a fish-eye look, which is common to all action camera. However, most video editing apps can fix this in post-production. This camera is billed as a 4K resolution, but I preferred to use it in 1080p mode for the 60FPS, which I found to produce a much better video due to the smoothness compared to 25fps (at 4K).",5,1,2018-1-9,1,1,0
"Depending on the use case(Like to shield the owner from liability, dash cam, body cam, ect) You need to have an accurate date and time.The issue here is, You can't. They include two batteries, But you cannot remove the battery from the camera without resetting the clock. This is a huge design flaw. Imagine if your phone died and you had to keep resetting the time/date?",3,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I've never dealt with an ""action camera"" so I was unaware of what I was getting into.  I bought this camera thinking it would do 4K or at least 1080 that it states, I was wrong.  The picture quality is worse than my older Samsung S4 and don't get me started on the video footage.  It was ""muddy"" and grainy and it does NOT come with EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).  I bought this mainly to record RC footage and it was just disgusting and at times nauseous with the playback. Also the built in mic barely picks up any audio.  I did enjoy however plethora of accessories that are supplied. After doing some extensive research I'm finally narrowing in on two cameras that fulfill my needs without breaking the bank.  Currently I am testing out the Akaso V50X ($100) and the Yi 4k Action Camera ($115).  Once again the Akaso comes with a slew of accessories, where as the Yi 4K only comes with the camera and charging cable. I'd say after reading some of the reviews for this camera on here it's fine for a child, but if you want something better I will let you know by next week.",2,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"I bought this for my son's birthday gift. As he is a little boy, the things I focused on are easy to control, not very expensive and water resistance. When I got this and tested those lists, all of them were very satisfying. First it is very easy to control. Though it does not support touch screen, the button is much more convenient for little boy. He could use this right after I teach him. And as you can see, price is very attractive for buyers who want to test action cam first. And it needs a case for water resistance but putting the case on cam is so easy and it works well.Though this is not as great as other expensive action cams. But for the person who wants to use this as a gift for a little one or try to start an action cam, I would like to recommend this.",4,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
"First off, I am a huge fan of gadgets and gizmos and I wanted an action camera to film my outdoor adventures with my friends and family. I bought this specifically for a Polar Bear plunge that a group of us were participating in. I had only tested the camera out minimally prior to the big event. I had begun filming around 9 am and stopped around 2 pm and I still had close to 90% of the battery remaining. When I got home I immediately uploaded the footage to my computer which only took a few minutes. I was very impressed by the picture & sound quality. My brother was also filming the event on his Go Pro (not 4k) and he even said he should have saved some money and gone with the Akaso. I did purchase the accessory kit and it came with everything I would ever need for the action camera. The day of the plunge I used the selfie stick, the floating stick, the headband, and the chest strap. The chest strap was the most comfortable, however, I felt like the best footage came from the selfie stick and headband. I used the floating stick for when we actually jumped in...let go of the camera to test it...it stayed right on the surface through the waves so I was assured that I could take this anywhere. The wide angle lens, the picture quality, the sound quality, the ease of use and most especially the price make this Akaso EK7000 camera's review the easiest 5 stars I have ever awarded. Thank you!!!!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I cannot give an accurate review because I have not seen any videos or pictures from this. It was a gift and I was told the batteries drain quickly. I am not sure how quick is quickly. I did overhear more people give the advice of saying if you lowered the resolution the batteries last longer (or something like that). As I said I cannot give an accurate review until we learn a little more about it. That is why I went 3's across the board. If I have more info, I'll update this. I hope it goes up to a 5 :)",3,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0

The video and picture quality exceeds what I expected at this price point. The camera comes with a waterproof case, two batteries and a wrist band with buttons to start and stop the video and to take photos. The battery life is decent. The built-in Wi-Fi works good, I installed (iSmart DV) app and connected from my phone and tablet.

I had tried other video methods that were not great.

"Got it for $55 from the akaso ebay store and glad i returned my gopro silver 4 for this. i use it mainly for riding my motorcycle and it holds up well at 80mph! came with a whole bunch of accessories and wish I opened the box sooner because I bought a gopro helmet mount when I really could've just used one of the mounting pads it came with. well, now I know gopro mounts are compatible with akaso is true. really happy with my purchase and it was 6xs cheaper than the gopro. i use the remote as a keychain and works well! oh I also use with a 64gb class 10 card, gives me no problems. microphone does suck but hey, its main purpose is a camera. battery life does suck, I feel like I got about an hour out of it, but they did give me 2 batteries.the camera also records in increments on 10 minutes and it starts over, if that bothers you. also it says it has wifi, but I really wouldn't consider it wifi, it's more like bluetooth where you connect it to your phone with an app and can view the files.",5,1,2017-3-9,1,1,1

The information and reviews for the AKASO indicated this camera was every bit as good at the GoPros, except $300 CHEAPER, so I went ahead and ordered it! The other 5 star reviews were right, this camera is great! My boyfriend loves the camera! He loves taking videos while I love photos. For 12 mp the pictures are very good. The video quality is great, as you would expect with 4k resolution. The accessories are an added bonus - we can't wait to use the camer and waterproof case while we are jet skiing around the Bahamas!

On the other hand, the device fell onto blacktop at 40mph and came out just fine, so it seems fairly sturdy.The picture quality says 4k, and there may be 4000 pixels, but it sure isn't the crisp image you think of when you here 4k. Very grainy. Same thing if you just take a picture.",3,1,2018-8-28,1,1,0
"Holy cow! This thing is unbeatable value-wise, I can't believe how nice this camera is for the price, and I would still be amazed if it only came with the camera and a battery, let alone a boatload of mounting accessories as well. The wrist mounted remote is hands-down (lol literally) my favorite feature of this thing, taking pictures and starting/stopping video couldn't get easier. No more having to use a mobile phone to trigger it, or fighting with buttons at the most inopportune times. This is going to be AWESOME for my freestyle drone, I am really excited to use this thing for real. Plus it has an LCD display screen on the back, so you can frame your shots super easy, this is the first action camera I've had with this feature and I'm surprised it has it since most other cameras with them are $$$.Buy this thing. You won't regret it.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
The pictures are nothing to be excited about. They are about the same as a low-end cellphone camera. The videos are actually pretty good. I'd definitely recommend this as a cheaper action camera. One problem could be a lack of firmware updates.,5,1,2019-6-12,1,2,0
"I mostly got this to put it on dogs and get funny video clips for their owners (I own a dog training & walking company).The video quality is good and the owners are loving the videos.  Sure the sound in the waterproof case isn’t the best, but I don’t really care much about the sound quality, as I often overlay that.  For the price, I’d say it can’t be beat.",5,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0
The purchase price is really great! The quality is very strong especially when you consider the cost. Accessories are just as reasonable. I have use it for both camera and videos of my grandkids and local events. I am really glad I found this Action Camera/Video on Amazon.  I liked it so much I purchased the upgrade for my son's family. They are equally excited to use it. The small size and multiple attachment options make using it really easy.

"The first time we tried to use this was at my son's high school District Baseball Championship game and, even though it was only 77 degrees, within the first 20 minutes of taping, it kept shutting down because the battery was overheating. We gave it a break (missing a lot of key parts of the game) and then tried to use the back up battery and, after 15-20 minutes, it shut down again because it was overheating again. I am so upset that we missed so much of the game, especially because the boys ended up winning the District Championship game and we have less than 1/4 of it recorded. So disappointed. Unfortunately, we had purchased it in November and just hadn't tried it yet, so it doesn't give us the option to return it even though that was the first time we used it.Update 5/15/2018 - After seeing my issues, customer service quickly contacted me and is correcting the situation, so I updated my rating to reflect confidence in the company caring about the experience of their customers and making sure issues are corrected.",5,1,2018-5-6,1,0,0
"I purchased the unit for a trip to the great Barrier Reef.  I used it to make videos snorkeling.  This unit does not have image stabilization and the image correction is not the best.  The videos were unstable due to me floating on top of the water.  Every wave movement was seen in the videos.  After researching, I found that a lot of the action videos are made with an external gimbal.  See attached video that makes my point.The case did not leak water and was completely dry.  I did not have any problem with condensation inside.",3,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

Does not have good quality video while mounted on a bike in motion, the camera moves around in the case, the auto focus sucks and everything is a blur. Takes a half way good photo and the video is some what good if the unit is not moved around. I got this just to see if it works and to put on my sons bicycle and if it breaks, oh well what's $60, better than destroying a GoPro. If you are looking for an entry level action camera to strap on a kids bike or something of sort then go for this unit, might serve your needs more than mine for I have several GoPro's and know what high quality is.",2,1,2018-8-14,1,0,0
"Hope you're shooting outdoors in direct sunlight. Otherwise, you're out a hundred bucks. This is a neat little camera that works well otherwise. Its fatal flaw, however, is that you cannot disable its auto-exposure, which is ridiculously over-sensitive. I purchased it to use for indoor shooting, but after a few tests, I was getting motion-sick from the brightness of the video constantly going up and down and up and down. It's not even an issue of available light - I have video lights and other cameras that work fine - but on that off-chance that something moving in your shot happens to reflect one of those lights toward the camera, the exposure will dip so far the video will practically be black for a few seconds. If the auto-exposure could be disabled, a momentary flash like that would not ruin otherwise decent video. But it reacts to every little change, every little motion in the shot and is constantly bouncing the exposure up and down, and the resulting video is useless.This is not only unacceptable because it would have been four lines of firmware code to include it, but because these cameras are made for unattended shooting. They're made to mount on something where you aren't constantly monitoring what it's shooting (the wifi functionality is garbage, btw, so I can't even do that). So, especially if you're the videographer and the subject, you can't keep track of whether you've done something to make the auto-exposure go crazy, and you have to just start it and pray you don't, and then re-shoot if you do. Which is pointless, because you'll set it off again with so much as a sneeze.",2,1,2017-2-27,1,9,0
"This is an inexpensive sort of go pro. The instructions aren't great, but the product works fine. You need to buy a phone size micro memory card and be sure to take both batteries if you do recording as they don't seem to last long. I have only used this on a stand to record my pickleball games.This does not have any zoom so you have to do that on your computer or TV. It does have quite a few ""attachment"" pieces to fit different applications. I took it out of the case as I have no need for it being in a case.",4,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"So much cheaper than other competitor products and perfect for what I wanted it for.  Came with 2 batteries and a few accessories.  I bought an accessory pack to match.  First product came broken and exchange was a cinch.  Warranty company even came through on their end.  I had to buy my own memory card so don't forget about that.  It gets good video and the case has been waterproof so far.  If I break it, I'd buy another because the price isn't a huge loss compared to other brands.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
So far so good.  I am using this for my motorcycles.  I have three that I use from daily commuting to bike nights to road trips.  I bought a mounting accessory kit to go with the camera.  One thing you need to know is that you have to buy a memory card with the camera.  It does not come with one.The basic kit you get with camera includes a charger base and TWO batteries.  Plus multiple charging options. It contains enough of a broad set of mounting options to use it straight out of the box.  Over all it’s a pretty good product.  We will see how time and use shake out.,5,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
"Right out of the box everything feels nice, light and sturdy. The user manual is a PDF with a QR code on paper. Excited, I first took a short clip inside my home. It came out a little grainy, that was early evening indoors blinds mostly down, still a good video tho. Later that week I went for a hike with dogs. My recording ability is poor but despite that the camera quality was awesome. First use of the waterproof case produced fog inside the case, this was without going in the water on a worm day and some humidity. Further tests are needed. I do not own a bike and was not quite ready for where to put this camera as it was an early present so on the hike I attached the camera to a doll and put it in the pocket of an apron I wear. Wi-Fi's connection was easy enough to figure out and it is also quite a nice feature, especially due to the mount i used and the way it was attached. The screen was visibly blocked by the mount and my body so the connection to my phone made it much easier to check on the view. Looking forward to more points of views to record from.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I had high hopes for this camera, based on the number of positive ratings it has received. I'm wondering if I received a defective camera, as I am experiencing the same issues a user with a 1 star rating had experienced; overheating, password not working, short battery life, clunky app.I was willing to overlook all of that if the video quality had been great, but it's unfortunately not. Even on 4K, then video is choppy and seems to be more like time lapse photography than smooth video. And the sound is very low. It's neat that it can be controlled from the app, but that's likely possible with other cameras. I also had a hard time navigating through the camera controls. Really not intuitive",2,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
Literally garbage.Its just a paper weight now .The video quality is very choppy and definitely not 4K.The app used to view your recordings is very buggy and doesn’t stay open for more then a few minutes before crashing.I thought I could save a couple 100$ by not buying a go pro but now I’m almost 60$ in the hole with trying to find a decent Action camera.Do yourself a favor DO NOT BUY THIS!!

I have bought other action camera and I had to purchase the attachment separately adding additional cost.  So overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.Thank you",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,1
"I have had several days to try this out and I wanted to put it to the test before I wrote a review. I mountain bike and wanted a nice action camera to get my trail footage. The first day, I tested it with the clip mount on my hydro pack chest strap. It was extremely shaky and filmed mainly my legs pedaling. So, the next day, I used it on my helmet. It was soooo much better. Wonderful footage. Very steady and not blurry. I will say, if you have it connected to your phone and the WiFi on, the battery will drain fast.  If the WiFi is off, I can get 3 to 4 hours of battery life out of each battery. This is perfect for a nice price saving camera. It works great!",4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0

"Legit review from an every day guy. This camera/video is great for the price. I was trying this out before buying a Go Pro. I've tested it out on my bike handlebars and head while kayaking and hunting, and it works great with good quality pictures and videos. All my family and friends say the pictures and videos look good. I use a program on the videos to add music so I don't know about the microphone. The app works better than I thought it would. The wifi means you can use the app to control the camera and view and upload your recordings and pics. Very easy to use.If you are looking for HD 4K pictures that you plan to show in an art galleria than send the money on a Go Pro.",5,1,2017-3-10,1,1,0

Would recommend for anyone looking for a great little camera that compares to the GoPro.",5,1,2019-7-3,1,1,0
"The waterproof case is total crap underwater. I took it scuba diving and it started taking in water as little as 15 feet underwater for a few minutes. By the time I got down to 60 feet, it took on enough water to short out the camera. I managed to get a few short video clips and upon review, the lighting underwater was horrible (without a red filter). Everything was brightly washed out and green looking, but it could have just been from losing red as you go deeper (which is why you add a red filter when diving - and I didn't). This camera housing was definitely not made for scuba diving. Fortunately, once I removed the battery and memory card and rinsed the camera itself with fresh water (Yes, you can do this without the waterproof casing), and let it dry out, it actually worked again. Gotta give them some credit for that.Outside of being underwater for a long time, I think this is a decent camera, especially for the money. I've got some great footage mountain biking and kayaking. I won't be taking this diving again though.",3,1,2017-9-25,1,0,1
"Purchased this camera for business in the hopes to find a cost-effective solution to creating training videos and fun media for advertising and was not disappointed.

I just wish there were some instructions for how to use all these mounts as I am sure I am not doing some of it right!Anyway I have made photos and videos while on my paddle board and the remote control on your arm was awesome for that.

"I am a fledgling maker and beginning content creator on an extreme budget. After careful consideration, I decided to give this little camera a try. Package arrived in the afternoon and I had it up and running without fail in less time than it takes to write this review.  After an hour's worth of tinkering, test shooting and checking out the manual (available from the manufacture's website), I had already shot most of what I needed to finish a project that was long overdue. After 24 hours of shooting and playing with the app for remote control via an Android device I think I really need to get another one for multi shot capabilities. And maybe a drone, or a R/C submersible....the fact is it is just the right price to start all those little projects you thought you might never try to do... To be honest...is it as good as a comparable GoPro?? I have no idea, I can't afford one of those...but I did get this one and so far it does everything I need it to do. I did have connect-ability issues with the Android app, and I'm sure it is probably a problem fine tuning my phone, but for most all I do, I don't need it.All told you can't beat functionality for the price....well done Akaso!",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,1
We have had the camera for about 2 weeks and so far so good. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the video. The only negative I have for the camera is the mic volume. Either ours is broken or the mic quality is really bad. Conversation is almost inaudible.  I don't know if this is normal or if there is a setting we need to tweak but this is the biggest gripe we have with the camera. If anyone else knows how to fix this please let me know! Definitely would have given this an extra star if the mic volume would have been better.,4,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
"Bought this camera for our vacation in Mexico as we planned to do a lot of snorkeling. The camera worked as expected for the first day, got some good footage no issues. On our 2nd day of snorkeling the camera stopped working half way through our adventure, once back on shore I took it out of the housing to find that the housing had been leaking and the camera had gotten wet! Upon further inspection I discovered a small defect in the camera housing that was allowing water to leak in! Thanks to this cheaply made product I lost a lot of great footage and was unable to continue capturing memories of our trip. Clearly should have invested in a better camera. And of course my return window closed while we were on vacation so now I cant even get my money back. Terribly disappointing. Another annoying thing about this camera is that it scrambles the pictures all out of order on the memory card. Overall not a good product",1,1,2019-9-17,1,1,1

I bought it for my husband because he wanted a GoPro camera and it turns out that the Akaso EK7000 is just as good, with a better battery life, comes with tons of accessories, and is way less in price.

We are still learning about it's features more as we go.

The video was not what I was expecting and the sound was extremely low - my car is not one of the most quiet cars in the world so I was actually worried that any kind of conversation in the background would be overtook by the car's noise but there was almost no sound whatsoever.

On batteries alone it will only record for about 1 hour before needing a swap.  Videos are also limited to 30 minutes, but it will automatically start a new video after it reaches that 30 minute mark.Video transfer is a snap if you use the app and the WiFi interface, but I opted to plug it into my laptop with the provided USB cable.

Do not expect good image quality from this. If you are looking for an extremely cheap action camera that you can do crazy things with and not worry about losing too much money then this is right for you. I dropped it in a pot of boiling water I put it in the dryer and I have plenty more plans on ways to try and destroy it while I'm getting some interesting footage.

"I really wanted to like this camera given the overall good reviews, but the housing leaked and my camera was completely soaked when I took it SCUBA diving. The sellers claim that this camera is waterproof to 100 ft., but within the first twenty feet of my first dive with it the housing was full of water. I returned my first camera, thinking it was faulty housing. But it happened again with the second one, too, so it's clearly not just a random manufacturing issue. This camera would probably be fine for splashes, but it is surely not waterproof and should not be used at any depth. If you are a SCUBA diver, beware as I didn't even get a single dive out of either camera that I tried. A complete waste of money and time.",1,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0

The best part is the remote connects automatically without having to sync like a GoPro so you can just pull it out and hit record.Finally, a warning on the battery they do not like even a tiny bit of salt water.

For the price that I paid, it did exactly what I needed it to do!  I didn't want to spend the money on a Go Pro for one trip and then not really have much of a reason to use it after that. The quality of the images were decent and the waterproof case did a great job of keeping all the water out. Only issue was that it was a little confusing figuring out the settings and what buttons did what, the instruction sheet did not explain much and I found myself running in circles trying to make my way through the menus. Overall, good product for what it's worth.",5,1,2017-7-22,1,1,0
"Bought this primarily to use as a front ""dash cam"" on my bicycle to have evidence in case I get in a crash and it's working out pretty good for that purpose so far.  Video quality is great, and it came with a large assortment of attachments and mounts (more than I expected)!  I do have 3 minor quibbles with the unit.  First, it will only accept 32GB cards and I had planned on re-using a 64GB card from another device, so have to buy another card (currently using a 16GB I had on hand).  Second, I've only used it once for a ride that was right at an hour, and it shut itself off about 5 min before I got home for some reason.  Will have to see what it does on the next ride.  Finally, it breaks the video into 10 min files which are about 1.5GB each at the default quality setting; would be nice if that was a setting and I could do 3 or 5 min blocks (more video files of lower size).  Overall, great camera at this price point and I'm pretty happy with it!",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
I can’t review because it was stuck in the box. No instructions and the knob for accessories was so tight I could not even remove it from the packaging. This product is like putting together ikea furniture with zero instructions. Don’t waste your time,1,1,2019-8-17,1,3,0
"This worked fine for a year or so. It started not focusing right. Sometimes it would be clear, other times it wouldn't. Now it's at the point to where I stopped trying to use it because everything is fuzzy and I'm well beyond the year warranty. I ended up getting a hero5 to get a higher framerate for 1080p recording for clearer slow motion. This was a good camera for starting out and if it was still working properly, I probably would have not gotten the hero5. However, the slow mo at 60fps the EK7000 does is not nearly as smooth as the slow mo when recording at 120fps the hero5 does.Still, for the cost, it was a good camera until the focus issue. The video quality was really good.",4,1,2018-5-16,1,0,0
"I was initially a little concerned given the cheap price, but this camcorder really delivered.The images and videos come out crystal clear.

"Really like the camera. I bought it primarily to take underwater photos and videos and am NOT disappointed in the quality.  What I am disappointed in is that the camera freezes and stops recording video. After a few minutes you are able to power it off and on again. If you remove the battery it will reset not only the power but also the date and time. I find the batteries last about 90 minutes.I had contacted customer service regarding the ""freezing"" issue and they were extremely supportive and made suggestions and received responses to my questions within a day.",4,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"This camera is pretty awesome! This thing is legit I had some issues with it when I first started but once I figured it out its been great! Like for 70 bucks you can buy a small accessory lit for go pro. With this its like the camera all the accessories a charger 2 batts! Insane. I was hoping to get a decent cheap camera but this thing will have me coming back for more! Already sold another to a friend! Thinking about upgrading to the nicer camera. 4k is not that good but you probably shouldn't buy a 70 dollar camera and expect 4k quality. It just has the ability. But at 1080 its pretty amazing for the price. I use it in extreme out door environments mountains, fires, will definitely have on the mountain come snowboard season. Buy buy buy",5,1,2018-7-16,1,0,0

ITS THE OLD STORY. IF ITS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE!  ITS PROBABLY NOT TRUE.  ABSOLUTELY NO BATTERY LIFE OF ANY VALUE.  PICTURES ARE NO WHERE NEAR MY GOPRO OR EVEN MY ION AIR PRO WIFI. THE ONLY THINGS OF VALUE WITH THIS CAMERA IS THE ACCESSORIES.. THEY ARE INTERCHANGEABLE THE  GOPRO . I AM SURPRISED THE MANUFACTURER DIDN’T CONTACT ME TO SEE IF I WAS SATISFIED.

"We purchased this camera after researching the go pros and thought the reviews were excellent and thought as a good action camera starter for our son.  Got it right on time, packeting it up and he was stoked.  I will say, there are a lot of accessories and no manual at all.  No clew how to put it together or what all the accessories are for so I went to utube and found a bunch of great videos, but a little disappointed no manual.  oh well. photos taken so far are excellent and video as well.  No head mount either, which I will hopefully get.  Also, no card included so buy one that is from a good company and make sure its for action cameras as the card that goes into this camera is tiny.  Called a micro memory card.  All in all so far so good, today.  I highly recommend this product for the price point.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"The camera was easy to set up and use. The pictures were typical underwater pictures - blue and no color. When I used the red filter, the pictures were much better. The red filter did not fit snug on the lens so I lost the first one when I went into the water. I made sure to hang onto the lens on the next dive and for the future, will glue it to the lens. My next step is to buy a light/flash.  Overall, the camera is worth the money especially with a few more inexpensive additions (red lens filter and light) which is needed for any underwater camera.(the last 3 pictures are without the red filter)",4,1,2019-12-3,1,1,1
I reviewed a lot of action cams and this was one that was tested against the go pro. I picked it because of that. I just got it and have used it quite a few times and watched the results on my 4K Ultra tv. The video was amazing!!! I mainly use it for fishing and other outdoor activities and have been really impressed!! Those that rate it bad really don't know how to use it. The only thing I have to say bad about it is that you get a lot of accessories that you'll never use. I threw most of it away. But overall I love it!! Buying another for sure!!,4,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"Quality of video is nice 5 stars however the app and the downloading of the videos is giving me difficulty, it will read ""unsupported file type""  ..making it not able to save into the device... I've removed the sd card and put it into a smart tv and it will also read incorrect format or something of the sort, but when i did the same thing with a go pro it displayed on the tv.... Great bang for your buck as far as quality, but the software/formatting is what is making it difficult.",4,1,2019-5-16,1,1,0
I was really impressed with the video quality out of this little camera. I did have some problems with the cam locking up while i was using the cam or switching from view to record. Overall it worked fine once i learned how to work around the locking up problem.Update: 03/23/2020; Customer service reached out to me and sent me a new in the box replacement cam.

"Just purchased this camera a few weeks ago to run on my FPV RC cargo plane.  Was initially worried I would need the digital stabilization but as you can see, there's no need.  Very simple to operate and takes FANTASTIC video and pictures.  Remember, this is an action camera.  So don't expect a lot of still picture options (ie zoom, and flash).  I've had dozens of crashes with this on my airplane with no damage whatsoever.  I've also dropped it half a dozen times without the case.  The WIFI is awesome (just short ranged) and the remote watch works great.  I haven't run this through live FPV yet so I'm not sure how the latency is.

We just ordered our AKASO EK7000 4K for a Carribean Cruise that we just returned from and it was awesome!  This camera took amazing underwater pics of fish and reef life and kids and the picture was amazing and the camera is very simple to use for pictures and video.  Our last underwater camera died after one use but this one we used every day of our cruise in the ocean and jumping off of waterfalls and it survived without issue even when I lost out of my hand during one of the waterfall jumps and it was laying at the bottom about 15 feet down and all the pictures turned out great.

"Honestly, I dont know what I have been doing without this action camera. I know a lot of people thinking about purchasing this will reserved due to the price (which is very affordable) and also the comparability with a GoPro. Yes, there is a slight marginal difference in image quality and stability, and yes, it does lack a a feature or two but honestly the differences are so minute, and unless you're trying to record for ESPN or the Olympics, they are not noticiable. I use for mountain bike trails mostly and I love the video quality I get . What this camera I think does even better than the GoPro is underwater imaging. Did some Jetski and scuba and I could not believe how clear and stable the video was.All in all, the features are amazing, using the app is easy, being able to come home and bring up the content on a smartphone or tablet through wifi in seconds is majorly convenient. The accessories included are great quality as well and non have malfunctioned on me as of yet.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"First and foremost, the camera records 1080p at 60fps very well.

I read a lot of good reviews and I told myself to give it a try for I can return it if I won’t like it.I am surprised for the video quality is so nice when I tried it. The last time I used it is when my daughter had a parade graduation due to pandemic. The video quality is so clear. I do have the app so I can upload it to my phone (iPhone) and share it right away. With all the accessories included, that’s a killer. I highly recommend this item.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0

This camera is exactly what I was expecting. It’s a great price for the quality. The user interface can be a bit frustrating and confusing to figure out. I also had some issues with my camera glitching and freezing up while I was trying to get videos during a snorkeling experience. It didn’t get wet at all and the water proof case did great. Other than that it works wonderfully! Would recommend to others looking for a cheap alternative.,4,1,2020-6-5,1,1,0
"it is plastic, and feels cheap. and comes with NO INSTRUCTIONs, you have to DOWN LOAD THEM and print them yourself!

Not bad for $40 but the picture and video quality are not even in the same ballpark as a GoPro or even my iPhoneX.  The time stamp on the photos needs to go too.  Could be I just need to update a setting for that.  If I had to do it over again I’d rather have no photos/videos than the crappy ones this camera produces.  Surprised it is so highly rated.  I suppose it’s a good value for the price.  Lots of nice tools in the box as well,3,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
So far it is a very good system.  My biggest problem was getting it all unwrapped without damaging something. Some tabs on the 'screen' protection film covering the waterproof case would have helped (for example).I was concerned about what the video quality would be like after reading some of the reviews.  I found the video quality to be good in the tests I performed -- maybe the critical reviewers received a damaged or defective unit.  It is also possible that they were trying to push the video stream received by their phone to a smart TV or a Chromecast device.  It appeared that the video streamed directly from the device via WiFi was inferior to the same video downloaded and played on the target device -- that would generally be expected.,4,1,2018-1-10,1,1,0
Getting the camera angled just right may require some time. my first ride on my motorcycle with the chest harness the camera was aimed a little too far downward . Come with lots of options for mounting. 720p quality still has a great picture. I kept it lower quality in hopes to save space on the SD drive and also to save battery life. Battery life is a big one having extra batteries probably wouldn't hurt depending on what you are doing with it and how long you will be away from power. Over all well worth the price in comparison to the go pro,5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"I've only had it for about a month, but all seems to be great.  You'll need a micro sd card to have enough memory for video.  I bought this to use as a dash cam in my 2018 Tacoma.  Fits perfectly in the go pro mount already installed.  The remote is great and I attached it to my dash under the air/heat knobs with 3m mounting velcro.  Very clear picture and playback.  Battery life seems to be average.  It'll run for about 3 hours time use and more if you lower resolution.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I love this camera! I got it so that I can record my kiddo doing awesome things at the beach or pool. The outdoor quality of the video is super clear. I am so excited about taking it into the water and out on the trails. Also, you can't beat the price. It is GoPro quality footage for like a quarter of the GoPro price. The wrist remote is really nice for vlogging, action shots, and photos (which it takes photos too). WiFi app is pretty sweet too. I haven't played with that to much yet, but I think it will be useful. It also comes with several attachments/mounts, but there are several bundle options on amazon that will work with the AKASO EK7000. I bought a $20 bundle to go with this sweet camera, and I feel like I hit the Jackpot.

The camera is very similar to a Go Pro Camera but very much cheaper. Batteries last for 70-90 minutes depending on the mode you set the camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for sports/action 4K recording and cannot afford an expensive camera. It comes with remote control which is very helpful in certain occasions.

"I'll get the bad out of the way right off of the bat, and the only issue is that there are not a lot of instructions.

It comes in a nice little package with all of the included accessories as shown, but like I said there are not instructions on how to use them.  After a YouTube Video or two I was able to figure out what each one was for and how they connect, and am very pleased.  The only reason I have not ranked the water resistance as a five is because I have not tried that yet, a little hesitant to be honest.  I have been wanting an action camera for years and used a buddies GoPro, personally I love the way this operates in comparison, and the price is sooo much better!",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"This is by no means comparable to a GoPro. This is an extremely affordable option and an easy entry into the action camera market, but you should really save your money for a better camera. While you can technically film in 4k, the image is still very poor. There is no video stabilization built-in which may not seem like a big deal at first, but after you view your first video, you will see how shaky the video really is. No amount of post-processing can fix that.Overall: This is a good camera for $50.00, but you will want to spend more money to get a nicer camera",1,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
Purchased this camera for a trip. But have only used it for daily use with family. Overall i like the camera. The size is perfect. And it fits into my wife’s purse. Which is VERY convenient!!

"I was skeptical about how good this camera would be. It comes with tons of accessories so you can set it up for just about any setting. I do wish they included a simple tripod or stand type accessory though but there are so many options with those it's best they leave that to the user. The app was easy to find but found it to be a little 'buggy', freezes when trying to delete a file.

I bought this sports action camera for my 12 year old son.  He is into motor cross riding now and wanted something to record himself riding.  We have had this camera for several months and he has took some really awesome videos with it.  The camera has great quality considering the price.  Several extra accessory's do come with the camera not much extra will be needed unless you just want something really special.  Does come with a battery charger ( I wasn't sure it did or not but it does).  I highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants to begin taking videos its a great beginner camera and also a great camera if you wont something at a decent price but want good quality.,5,1,2018-5-6,1,0,0
"Good for the money.  I bought to record myself out fishing.  The picture quality is good,  however don't expect to be using 4k.  The 4k quality is very choppy since it has a low screens per second.  The wrist strap is also a great addition.  The kit comes with two batteries,  however I don't feel like the batteries last long at all.  If you keep the camera on <not even recording> I expect maybe 70 minutes of battery life.  Fishing for a full day I bring a portable battery charger to charge to be able to keep camera working.  Other than that,  I feel it's very easy to download and upload videos to editing apps and youtube...I'd contemplate going with a go pro because I hear they have voice activation and I know their batteries last much longer.  Also their screens per second is much higher for cleaner images.  But if money is the main factor,  this camera gets the job done.",4,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0

"I really like this camera. For the price the quality of picture, video, and sound is great! I first bought this in October so I could test it out for my trip to Hawaii in Jan, which I am on right now. The battery that it comes with does not hold a charge long. I purchased a selfie stick that is also a charging stick so I could plug the camera directly into it and have it hold a charge through the day. It worked GREAT until the port in the camera where you plug into the charging cable collapsed into the camera. (See the top port in the picture where you cannot plug anything in anymore because the metal port fell in) There is no way for me to charge the camera now. I have to charge multiple batteries and switch them out through the day to use the camera. I was hoping to use the camera long term but I know switching batteries out through the day will get old quick. It’s definitely a design flaw as I have used this camera less than 10 times to date.UPDATE: The seller sent me a new camera because of the old one breaking. I will be using this one and updating this review if I have the same occurrence with the new camera, but so far so good!",4,1,2019-1-11,1,1,1
"My husband enjoys project cars and drag racing and pretty much the only thing on our TV ever is YouTube builds of drag cars, test and tunes, etc.  I wondered if he might like to make his own, so I got this for him as opposed to a GoPro since I wasn't sure if he would actually use it.  I was very wrong in my assumption that this product might sit on the shelf. He uses it CONSTANTLY and the endless hours of video I can watch in lieu of spending time with him are of great image and sound quality. Due to the lack of times he needs to renter the house from his shop I surmise that the battery life is excellent.

"I was nervous at first but other reviews helped encourage me. I received my package today and opened it up to find out they shipped me the wrong color.... I ordered black but received a light blueish color. I don't really care and don't feel like going through the exchange process but I was more nervous than ever.  I opened the package and found a seemingly well built unit. Very comparable to the name brand cameras I've had before. I keep destroying and or losing the high priced name brand cams and wanted a lower cost alternative and was willing to take a reduction in quality both build and video wise. I'm here to tell you first hand. BUILD QUALITY AND VIDEO QUALITY ARE ON PAR WITH GOPRO! I was especially suprises at the low light performance as that's usually the worst. If I had any complaints to nit pick, being an acrobatic drone pilot, the lense doesn't deal well with sudden high light. Think flips and the sun passes across.

Now that I that figured out I am using this camera all the time! This is a wonderful deal for the price and I would recommend to everyone who wants to start out with action cameras! I take it with me everywhere!,5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"This is a fairly good value, given the price.  The photographs are not great.  It does not pull in a lot of light and the images are blurry.  The video is better, for my usage at least.  I purchased this camera mainly to take video for a trip with snorkeling.  I did not want to spend a lot on a go-pro.  I thought it had fairly good reviews and that if it breaks after a few uses, it was worth a try.  It was the price of a few waterproof disposable cameras.  The video had good color and was bright.  It looked like a high definition image.  The video did not have a very wide-range view though.  That is, the field of view was focused on a small area.  This may have been partially due to the shallow water depth.  I do not know how a go-pro would have looked, so it is difficult to compare.  The case fit perfectly on the snorkel gear and the camera stayed dry.  It was easy to use for someone with a limited amount of tech skills.  The remote is not waterproof.  I used a 32GB Sandisk Ultra micro SD card (not included).  Overall, it was a good value at around $45 and served its purpose.  Do not expect it to perform like a go-pro though.I watched some product reviews on youtube that do a nice job reviewing and appear to be honest assessments.",4,1,2020-2-21,1,0,1
"Not having any experience with this type camera, I did a little homework and ordered this one.  My purpose was to chronicle my fishing and boating activities in SW Florida.  On the day after Christmas, my son and I did a two boat trip up the Ferguson River out of Everglades City and I tried it out.  I loaded EZ iCam on my phone and had a camera mount that I'd made that stood right behind my seat in my canoe.  I alternated between the remote that came with the camera and my phone to operate the camera.  When using the phone app, you can see the image you're recording live on your phone.  I wasn't sure what I was getting but once downloading when I got back home, I was amazed at the quality.  I only took movies, but quickly discovered that you can pause in a movie and use the Microsoft snipping tool and capture an image to print or post.  I love this product and will post additional reviews as I get more familiar with it's features.",5,1,2017-1-6,1,1,0
What a great video camera.  I use on my fishing YouTube channel I have called destination fish zone.  I have been very happy with the video quality.  A little hard to see the red light bleeping to know if you are recording in bright sunlight but that is probably the same with any camera in similar conditions.  I bought a second one recently.  Also I love the mobile phone WiFi viewing of the video and recording using my cell phone.  Very cool.,5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera for my parents to use when they went on their vacations last year. It was very simple to use (my parents are 70 and do not understand technology very well) and photos they took came out very clear. The wide angle lens helped them capture some pretty good photos underwater while they were snorkeling. My brother has also used this camera when he went sailing and took great photos with it. It was helpful to have the additional accessories as they helped keep the camera firmly attached to the wrist. Even now, I use it for taking photos of my family when we are at the pool or lake. The waterproof case works great! Overall, very pleased with this purchase!",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera, along with the cold weather batteries for a snowmobiling trip to the UP Michigan earlier this year, and could not be happier with the results!I used mostly video, but the quality is perfect. And I really put it through the ringer too. I mostly ride off trail and a few of the morning we were out it was well below zero. The camera got whacked by branches, constantly snowed on, and run at 50+ mph in a -15 degree wind chill... not a single malfunction.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"I really like this camera. It does what I want it to do. Two things I wish I would have known from the beginning though:1. If the battery dies during a recording, you lose the ENTIRE recording. That's frustrating. I record my tennis matches and my last battery only lasted about 55 minutes.",4,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0
"Ordered due to great reviews and price for a snorkeling trip. Water resistance was flawless, picture quality and image stabilization worked great as well. Every possible mount you can imagine is included, as well as an extra camera battery. The instructions that you can download are very thorough. Really like the remote feature, it would be great if that were actually waterproof too so you could use while skin-diving. Highly recommend this unit.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"Overall I really like this camera, especially for the price I paid for it! Has much better video and picture quality then what i thought. I haven't tried it myself yet but I've seen a few videos of people tying these cameras to fishing poles to dunk them in the water to get some footage of the wild fish and whatever else in there (damage, water free thanks to the clear case it came with) and that's exactly what I plan on doing! Only thing I don't like about taking pictures with this camera is the motion blur is a bit too much for me. The audio for videos as well sounds decent, but honestly could be better. Thankfully you can attach other microphones to it of your choice. Picks up my voice good when i'm holding it in front of me or even holding it by my side while recording. This also came with generous amount of  accessories as well as 2 rechargeable  batteries, which is really nice for when a battery runs out because then i have a back up! Definitely plan on investing for more of this companies camera equipment in the future. I'm a happy customer. Thanks for the product!",4,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
This product worked exactly as described. It came with all the necessary equipment and the camera resolution was very impressive. You can't beat this price!Update 06/2018:,5,1,2018-5-7,1,0,1
"This is a feature packed little camera for the price! Takes excellent footage, and comes with a TON of accessories. It comes with 2 batteries and a separate charger although the battery can be charged in camera via the micro usb as well. There are numerous mounts and couplers to mount it up in any circumstance: dash cam, handle bar mount, helmet mount, waterproof case, a vented back plate for the case, and spring loaded clip. It also comes with a remote camera and video control. The instructions are minimal, but I was able to quickly figure it out. The documentation says it can use up to a 32gb micro sd card, but I’m rocking a 64gb with no issues. For the quality and price point you just can’t go wrong with this product!",5,1,2018-2-3,1,0,0
The price and quality are great. The battery life non-existent. I have it mounted on my motorcycle helmet but a single small bump can shut the camera off. So I can’t depend on it to capture anything for recreational or insurance use. If you’re just casually filming or taking pictures this camera is perfect but not so much for any active adventures.,1,1,2019-5-8,1,1,0
"Would have generally given a 3 star ratings, but then taking the price into comparison, with similar HD action cameras in the market, needed to give a 4 star rating. Was a bit concerned before ordering the product though the reviews were good. But after using it for the first time, considered it a good value for the money.Though 170 degrees is the mentioned angle, close up shots looked more like a fish eye at the edges. Long shots did not seem to have the effect or at least was not notable.",4,1,2017-1-13,1,1,0
"I ended up returning this because it was just not reliable. It is a great camera for those on a budget, which is why I purchased it. But the battery life was unpredictable and sometimes it wouldn’t turn on. I spent more time trouble shooting it than actually using it.",3,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
Got this camera to chronicle my waterfowl\upland bird hunting.  Awesome little camera with a wireless remote that straps to your wrist.  It hooks up to your phone as well with Wi-Fi but find that it kills the battery life much much faster than using the wrist remote.  I'm not sure that it has a microphone because the few videos I've made had none.  Not a deal breaker for me though.  Great little camera for a stellar price.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting a good action camera without paying the high price of a GO-PRO.,4,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"I was about to shell out hundreds of dollars for a more expensive brand of Action camera. That would have been such a waste. Its so wonderful that this camera comes with so many different accessories. I will say that the amount of accessories was a little overwhelming and I don't think enough instruction was given on how to use all of them, but a quick YouTube search helped with that. I will definitely be buying more as gifts.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"Bought this camera rather than a gopro for the same reason you're reading these reviews... super cheap! I was impressed to get a bunch of free accessories in the box along with an extra battery.Overall, what do you really want out of an action camera? It has intuitive controls, clear video, and writes everything to a microSD card. I haven't tried the software but I hate uploading videos through wifi anyway regardless of the product.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"I love to ride my ATV, and bought this product for that reason. was exited to try it out. and It worked perfectly. The mount stayed stable to my helmet & ATV and I had no problems. I tried using 4k, just to try, but 25 frames is just not enough. It is very spotty and you can barley enjoy the video. Other than that AND it's complete inability to pickup the SLIGHTEST bit of audio other than the slight rumble of the ATV. Even with the case off, the mic pickup is not great. One thing I must mention is the wide angle lens. It was great, as I could get the whole area in one video. I used it at a pool, made awesome underwater shots, as it is completely waterproof.  I have not tried all of the mounts, but I have tried a few. The adhesive mount stuck instantly onto my helmet and stuck well, but then I bumped the mount and it unstuck, but that was on me. Overall, if you want a dependable, and very capable camera, go with this one, as it is the quality of it is that of a $300 GoPro brand, (I did quite some research) with the price of a cheap one.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"I’m pretty good with technology, so getting this camera should not have been a problem. The directions are thoroughly in adequate. I was able to connect this to my iPad through Wi-Fi one time, the connection was lost, and could never we connect again. The fully charged battery lasted only about 15 minutes. I followed the directions exactly to use time lapse video mode, but no time lapse video  was recorded. Devices like this should be easy to use, and in 2018  I have no tolerance for devices that make you work.",1,1,2018-3-9,1,1,0
"When shopping around for cameras, I was primarily looking for something I could bring kayaking. Therefore, there were a few features that were essential to me:1. The camera had to either be waterproof, come with a waterproof case, or have a cheap waterproof case available;",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"This little camera works great for the price.  We initially were looking at GoPro like everyone does.  We came across this product and after comparing features we decided to give this one a try before we purchased the much more expensive GoPro.  We use the camera in less than extreme conditions and we have to say that for us, this is a great option. We have purchased a few aftermarket mounts from GoPro for it.  These mounts are of obviously higher quality than the ones we received with our camera, but for the price, the ones we got were completely functional.  For us, this camera is perfect.  Thanks Akaso!",5,1,2017-3-29,1,2,0
"I'm old and tech stuff often frustrates me. Not this time. Comes with a link to a pdf user manual that walks you thru step by step. I'm thrilled with the results. Used it as a dash cam, made an instructional video and if spring ever comes to New England it will go on my bike handlebars.  Everything works as advertised including the app I put on my iPhone.  You don't need to buy the extra attachments package - it comes with enough stuff to keep you busy.  Very pleased with this purchase.  You'll probably want a multi card reader though - it makes it easy to pop out the sd card stick in in your computer to save your vids. I learned they are too big to attach to emails but if you use a free google drop box you can send them to everyone.",5,1,2019-3-23,1,0,0
My daughter wanted a camera to video herself on the skateboard and after messing with a cheaply made one with low video quality I decided to upgrade her and got her this one. The video quality is very good and the camera itself is easy to use. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 star rating is because it came with now instructions on how to set up all the mounting  accessories so it’s like a puzzle without the final picture. It’s pretty frustrating so she hasn’t  been able to use it on her helmet as she hoped. She holds it and that’s good enough for now. I’ll probably have to go on YouTube to see if someone can explain all these extra parts to me.,4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"Everything works great right out of the box.  Exactly as described.  Great quality video.  My favorite part is that I can connect it to my phone and record video on it via the phone, while the camera is in another part of the house or just away from me.  It also came with so much stuff, including two batteries and a whole bunch of mounts, all different for different setups.  I was surprised by how much you get with this camera.  I definitely recommend!!",5,1,2019-9-20,1,1,0
"I used this camera on one trip for a few days and it worked great. The quality was amazing and we had so much fun with it. However, a week later on our next trip we pulled it out and couldn't get it to work. When we press the power button it turns on and shows the ""AKASO EK7000"" screen. With no SD card in it says ""No Card"" but we can see the screen as if ready to video/photograph. When we put the SD Card in the screen goes black and we can't see anything anymore. It's a SanDisk SD card shown to go with the camera. Can't figure out what the error is and very frustrating to only seem to be able to get that one use out of it.",1,1,2019-9-13,1,1,0
"I've been disappointed with this camera.  I bought this to replace an Eken 4K Ultra HD Camera which died after a few years of use..  The Eken camera appears to be the same camera (same form factor, batteries, and accessories), but did not have the same issues which are as follows:1. Regardless of the video resolution, the camera will not record consistently.  It creates multiple files of varying lengths, with gaps in the video of a few seconds.  This makes the camera almost useless.",2,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0
"Camera works very well except and BIG except: it does not expose the shot properly when used in 20+ feet in depth of water. I used this camera on 5 separate scuba diving trips and the housing never flooded. Deepest I took it down was 70 ft. The problem is that it has trouble capturing details in mixed lighting conditions. It blows out midtones and highlights to compensate for shadows and leaves ugly footage. The only time it worked it fine is when I aimed the camera lens at areas that were not exposed to bright light (mixed lighting conditions) and the colors and exposure were the same throughout. You may also want to keep in mind that the colors rendered by the camera are not true. This isn't the camera's fault but the need for a red color filter to compensate for the loss of color as you descend.When used for mountain biking though, this camera produces AMAZING footage. Can't complain about that. Smooth 1080P video and vibrant colors. Do note that colors are saturated so you may want to tone it down in post. Beside that, this is a great product for the price. The user would need to know how to use it according to conditions though.",4,1,2018-1-21,1,1,0
"Camera is very easy to use even grandma can give it go. Its a very unique camera. Quality is alright, it will also adjust to nighttime. You will still need some sort of light though. The only thing i would change is the battery life. It tends to die quickly.I would just suggest getting the upgraded version of the camera. It really a simple small camera. Really easy to replay videos. Customer service was also very kind and made me feel like a customer again. Answer all the questions i asked.",5,1,2018-10-15,1,0,0
"Bought this camera for vloging after tons of browsing. I saw over 14,000 positive reviews and decided to try it. All I can say is WOW. The amount of accessories, the build quality, the wifi,the expandable memory, extra battery and charger. The video is fantastic in an affordable action camera.. I have other action cams costing much more that are not as complete as this little beauty. It even has a remote and waterproof case...I will definitely recommend this as a great device and look forward to buying other AKASO products as well.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"We are taking a trip down with a group to Pigeon Forge for a week long Baseball Tournament.  Thought it would be fun for the kids to have a ""GoPro"" for the ziplining, roller coasters, etc.  Found this camera bundle, and all of the parents are still amazed at the overall package of what is received and the very low cost.  Took forever to sort through all the accessories for mounts, but in a good way !  They really prepare you for a great experience out of the box.  A charger and two batteries is a nice touch.  So is the remote.Nothing but happiness with this purchase.  It does not come with a SD Card (Which is good, since you will want to get one of type an size of your preference), so order one from Amazon at the same time.  Much cheaper here.",5,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0
"Easy to set up, works with pretty much any universal camera accessory. Photo & video quality is awesome! No issues so far with any of the typical bumps & abuse using it on our outdoor adventures. Battery life has been fine (I do turn it off when not actively in use just to help prolong the need for changing the battery). Connects to my laptop without any extra software. Looking forward to using it more once the Coronavirus travel restrictions are lifted!",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0

Couldn't mount it on my Goldwing so my wife was holding it while riding on the back. We got caught up in the rain, she started recording. Came home and downloaded it on my laptop. Video quality was pretty darn good. Audio could be better but I put music in the background anyways. Overall, I am very happy with it so far. Hope to make more videos soon. I would definitely buy another one in the near future.",5,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
Let me start by saying this camera is awesome! Not only does it feel and look great but it has an amazing camera. The video quality is crisp and bright. Even in a poorly lit room the video quality is still there and pretty nice. I also love that the camera has built in filters and white balance to help with lighting situations. lighting is key lol.  It is very easy to use and comes with tons of accessories! i love the water proof case that comes with it. It snaps and just hugs the camera all snuggly like. I honestly dont think i will have a problem with it leaking. It comes with tons of mounts and an awesome wireless remote that looks and feels like a nice watch.I can keep going on about how much I love this this camera but ill cut it short by saying this camera is worth the buy.  they did not skimp out on quality with this one. For the price you can not beat it. The video quality is awesome too! This camera was everything I expected it to be! If you are considering buying one. I highly recommend this model :),5,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0
"I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out.",3,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"Great camera for under $100! The camera is very light, almost delicate, but the waterproof case fits perfect. The only downside with the case is it muffles the sound when recording. That may be the case with all waterproof cameras though. The attachments are abundant, but I do wish the bumper case enclosed the entire camera. Charges great, great video and sound, and fairly easy to use. The instructions are broken English and the App they advertise is non existent, but I've found a couple apps (iOS) that work well. I didn't realize this was Wifi, not Bluetooth, so the pairing is like pairing to a router. No problems there. All in all, I bought this for my daughter to play around with outside and on vacations...perfect starter camera vs a GOPRO.",4,1,2017-3-23,1,1,0
"Had this for awhile now and finally used it at an Arena Driving Trial last weekend. I used the chest mount instead of the helmet mount, just because. Adjusting the angle was easy and if you hit the right button (the gray one) on the remote the camera takes lovely video! I found the clarity and sound to be excellent. I shot my Hazards course, which was about 16 minutes long over differing terrain, and the camera didn’t get hot like I read in other reviews. I got great video of my horse’s butt and the beautiful Prescott National Forest. And having it was great backup for those times you might get called of course when you’re not!

"I got this for my Barber class to record my practical portion of the classes for grades. I only got it yesterday and so far it is doing what I want. The only thing is the instructions and how we have to get on the computer and they really are not good instructions and it comical that they just show the picture of the accessories you need and the addition to the equal of what it's suppose to look like without any details. It seems easy, but it's not for me so they shouldn't think everyone is capable of looking at a picture and putting it together and they are not good pictures anyway which is funny since I'm buying a camera that takes pictures. Once I figured it out, so much time wasted, I rigged it on my microphone stand using the accessories for bike handles and secured it with the velcro strap. For the price and what I want to use it for seems to do the trick. I'm having difficulty downloading the videos from the app ISmart DV, don't know what's up with that.",4,1,2020-9-18,1,0,1

Tried this 2 more times and did the same thing. I would rather spend on something more durable and that will guarantee better results.

The only issue (as others have mentioned) is that the video stops after 5 minutes, but it will continue, just in another video file.  So I did not lose any video.  Not a huge deal as can easily put them together with editing software anyway.  The still picture quality was also very good.  The battery lasted maybe two hours, but having a second one on hand was great (which comes with it).  I found the camera easy to use, and easy to change out battery.Will be taking it for underwater filming in a few months, and based on usage so far am very pleased with quality, especially given the price versus GoPro!",4,1,2017-2-7,1,1,0

"I purchased the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera for a couple specific uses.  I have a lot of animals on my property and enjoy capturing photos of them.  This little camera can be placed close to where the birds bathe and the deer congregate.  I can use the remote control to turn the camera on and off.  The waterproof case allows me to leave it out in the rain.  Additionally, it is useful for events like weddings where it can be mounted unobtrusively and turned on remotely to gather the scene,  Picture quality is amazing for the size.  It is a nice compliment to other cameras for zoom and close up shots.  At a wedding in Denmark, I used it to record a ""traditional"" plunge in the harbor.  I also used it to record reception speeches and activities with great success.  Given the quality and versatility, I am upgrading my review from 4 to 5 stars.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

Since I have not had much previous experience with action cameras, I am very happy with the cost for me to get the feel for the action camera and how to best use it.

I also purchased a pack of Luxebell Accessories Kit which also works great with the camera.  So I took the camera to the ski slopes and it was not disappointing.  It was extremely easy to use.  With the wristband remote control that I wore on my wrist, I could start/stop filming, taking pictures at ease.  I used the waterproof casing that comes with the package and mount it on my helmet and selfies stick.  I'm extremely happy about this camera and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a really affordable action camera.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"Bought this for my wife's birthday. So far, we love the video quality of the camera and all the different accessories you can use. She's already used it on her bike rides - it fits well on the handlebars, and you can easily take a video while riding. While we still have some things to figure out with it, such as pictures, sound quality, etc., it is overall a great product for capturing our activities.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"This is the second action camera I purchased. The first was a slightly cheaper (~$50), different brand, and it was awful. When I received the Akaso (~$70) I was very surprised at how much better it was than the cheaper alternative.------",5,1,2018-2-5,1,1,0
"I used this camera when my husband and I went to Akumal, Mexico in February 2020. We did a lot of snorkeling.  I had never used an underwater camera, so wasn't sure what to expect. I purchased it based on price and reviews. I didn't want to spend a lot of money just in case it didn't work out- didn't want to waste too much money.  It worked better that I had expected. I took thousands of pictures, because I wasn't sure if they would turn out. Well, I know have A LOT of pictures of sea turtles, sting rays, fish, coral, and shells. It was easy to use once I goofed around with it for awhile before going snorkeling. I also purchased a Crosstour Floating Hand Grip Waterproof Handle. It worked great. It gave me an extra ""hand"" because the camera is small. I was afraid that I might drop it in the ocean.  I also bought Nordic Flash Waterproof Camera Float straps to go on the camera- just for an extra piece of mind. I didn't want to loose the camera. All in all, I would definitely recommend this camera. It was very waterproof and didn't worry at all.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,1
"This was my first action camera. I have been tempted to buy one for a while and try my hand at motovlogging, but I didn't want to spend too much money. The high end cameras I'm sure are great, but I couldn't see buying one of those for my first camera. Just too much money.I finally decided on this camera and I'm glad I did. The picture quality is fantastic. I've been shocked at how good it is. It also came with quite a few accessories. The quality of everything seems good to me. I have no complaints at all. I no longer want to buy a more expensive camera. When this one finally dies, I'll just buy another one. It's a great camera.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"This camera works just as well as one you would pay $300+ for. Comes with a ton of accessories as well. The videos come out very clear and the pictures are not pixilated or anything. Read the directions carefully before taking it under water. I would definitely recommend this action camera to a friend!! If you want to use the camera right upon receiving it, make sure you have a memory card as it doesnt come with one",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
I just love this little action camera! It is extremely clear with 4K resolution and perfectly water proof to give me confidence to take anywhere. I also like the fact that it comes with tons of mounting adapters and connectors for every situation. It's great that it is so small that I can take it along with me in my DSLR bag. The other brands are much more expensive but for a budget camera this little guy packs a wallop!,5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"The AKASO camera delivers on what it promises. It has pretty decent image quality and the connectivity to the mobile app works well. Ultimately, this product is great for the price. There are only two critiques I could give when it comes to the overall package. First of all, the sound quality was terrible. When speech did come through, it was incredibly muffled at best. Now, that doesn't matter a whole lot if you're snowboarding or waterskiing (since there would be lots of wind rushing by anyways), but if you're walking through the forest or sitting around a campfire and want to capture the audio it may be worth looking at other options. Second, the set of mounts given in this package are largely useless. There are maybe 2 or 3 that could be realistically used, so I'd recommend getting a separate body mount or gimbal if you want something reliable. These critiques being given, this camera is great quality for the price.",4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"The packaging was nice. It came with a lot of Accessories for mounting on many platforms. The camera itself is pretty easy to use. Go to YouTube for a video instruction set up. The password for the WiFi is 1234567890. Had to watch the video to find out. No real instruction come with the camera. So the video was very helpful.Now for the quality. Videos come out really nice with many options in the menu for images per second. Battery life could be better. If you buy a motorcycle mount make sure it comes with a tether line, so you have extra security if the 3m sticky tape doesn’t hold up. That’s just a personal suggestion. They are also available on Amazon. It comes with a waterproof case to keep the rain out and as well be used underwater. Have not tested the underwater capabilities yet, but when I do you all will be the first to know.",4,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"For the price, can’t believe how great this camera is. I’m assuming the video I uploaded will be compressed, but the true quality is amazing. Loooing at purchasing a second in the near future for multiple angles.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
"I needed an 4K action camera, and I was on budget : )............ Now I use one camera for everything and that is my AKASO 4K/EK7000. This unit is incredible. I shoot it from the hip, from behind, upside down, under spray of waterfall and pointing at a racing hare - every shot looks great! I'm still working on mastering the camera pictures/video, but from what I've seen this camera is a great buy especially in this price range. It's a great camera for travel due to its convenience.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"Cant beat the camera for its price. The above water pictures came out really good despite being in the water proof case. The waterproof case did its job really well to. Went snorkeling and it worked perfect. As well as took it Scuba diving at 40 ft. The case held up, and the pictures still came out good. I didn’t grab a red filter so the pictures are green as expected. But at shallower depths the pictures still came out crisp and clear. I’m not a professional photographer, but anyone wanting to capture the moment without paying $400, its a perfect buy. Battery life lasted the day, but I powered off when unneeded. Yet to use all the attachments.Don’t mind the date in the pictures. Somehow changing the batteries or something reset them. All from this year, 2020.",4,1,2020-3-15,1,0,1
"I wanted to get a GoPro for ski or water activities, but when I checked the price-tag for the original GoPro it was too high. Then I started searching and came across this one. It does everything GoPro does and it comes with a ton of attachments, so you don't even need to buy an extra accessories kit. I literally cannot think of anything you can't attach it to. I use it with 64GB card, which works with no problems. It has very wide view and image stabilization is amazing considering with this price. Definitely recommend for others who are searching for cheaper GoPro alternatives.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

"First of all, if you like the price buy it! It works just fine for all different shots. It comes with some great accessories and a waterproof case as well as many great mounts for all different types of action shots.  We are using it for an independent film that needs to have some great action shots. We tried other action cameras (non-GoPro) and they don't compare to the quality of this camera.  The only downside was the difficulty of connecting to WiFi.  We used the app suggested in the manual and it is spotty at best.  Overall, great camera and great price. If you're on the fence about it, I suggest to buy it. It works well!",4,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I just received my camera about a week ago and it's awesome! I'm still figuring out some of the settings, but all in all I can't complain.  You can pair it to your phone and see what it sees in real time. I used it several times to record what I do at work . It't pretty easy to download the files to your phone or computer too. I love it and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable action camera!",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"It works for my needs.  Customer support is a little slow, as I had to wait 24 hrs. to receive a response to each e-mail sent.  However, the support was great (thanks Margaret).  Initial camera had a recessed button that was working properly on the side of the device.  An exchange was setup promptly, well as promptly as 24 hrs. for each response can be.  Purchased this to record my daily commutes on bicycle.  Plenty of mounts and extremely decent video capture.  I have it on loop recording so I get a 10 minute snap of my, approximately, 17 minute rides.  The reason I keep it on loop recording is so that it overwrites the data on the card that I don't need because the majority of my rides are incident free.  I can recommend to folks who are in my situation.  Can't speak for any other uses however.",4,1,2017-11-3,1,1,0
"This is an amazing camera! I am able to do just about anything with it! It works with lots of mounts and attachments. It can take amazing panoramic videos and photos! The only changes I suggest are a better microphone (for taking videos without waterproof case on), and a VIDEO time-lapse mode. It comes with the basic mounts (bike and helmet). It can connect to the the iSmart DV app and AKASO DV app. It can be used as a webcam too! You can charge the battery while it’s in the camera. Compatible with Micro-HDMI. Comes with two batteries and a charger.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0
"I was impressed at first, especially for the price! But if you plan on using the camera with the waterproof case I had many issues with the camera over heating (is my guess) and shutting off or the screen freezing...both would lose any footage that was supposed to be recorded. Note that this was not after extended use, it did this at 2-3 minutes into the videos almost every time. Then would not work for 30+ minutes after that while it cooled down. If you plan on using it without the case it might work better, I honestly got too frustrated with it to even keep messing with it. This could just be a problem with the one I received for all I know. But it comes with lots of accessories, which I was excited about! Maybe once my frustration goes away I will mess with it again and have better results, but not going to get my hopes up.",2,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"Camera came with no issues that I could see.I know other reviews have/had said things about the time lapse not working, but it DOES work. It has options to take a picture every 2,3,4, etc. seconds and I've tested it and it does work. It's possible it did not work previously.",4,1,2017-1-17,1,1,0

I bought this camera as an entry-level for my son that uses RC's definitely very happy with the quality and all the extra features that came with it I think it is the best value for your dollar as an entry-level camera before you get a GoPro.. I don't think that you're going to find any better quality camera it's definitely high quality amazing waterproof case very happy with that my son's very happy we transferred from RC's to riding quads and everything in between,4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"This little camera does the job of a much more expensive counterpart, all for the fraction of the price. I love all the ways in which I get to use this camera they I can't with my phone. I have it mounted on my motorcycle helmet and it helps keep me honest while driving, but his others accountable on the road as well. I also have submerged it in my reef tank and it's been fun seeing the cities and fish up close in their environment.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,1
"IMO, you can't beat this camera in this price range, or even with more expensive cameras! I bought this action camera so I could ""take"" my ladyfriend on rides on my motorcycle even though she's 6000 miles away. After seeing the way it mounted to the handlebars, I was rather dubious as to whether it would work very good. I was pleasantly surprised! The resulting video was clear, sharp, and did not have the fuzziness from the vibration of the bike that I had expected. The remote control that is worn on the wrist is a very important feature for me considering how I plan to use the camera. I don't have to fumble with the camera to turn it on and off while riding.  I am in the process of figuring out how to permanently attach the mounts to my helmet. I don't fully trust the sticky pads provided with the camera. I would suggest this particular camera for those with a limited budget. The attached video, which was shot through the windshield of my bike,  is a small example of the picture you can expect. Much better than I had anticipated!",4,1,2018-5-22,1,0,0
"I've had this camera for about a week and so far I think it's a fair value. I took off one star because the instructions were vague and had several typos, indicating a lack of editorial oversight. The camera comes with loads of mounting options, which is excellent, but there are absolutely no instructions on how to use them. It's mostly intuitive so I did figure it out after fiddling for a bit, but I was very surprised at the complete lack of instruction.Once I figured out how to get it working, the camera itself works just fine. Video and picture quality are as expected. I've found the wrist control to be mostly useless so far due to the fact that the camera powers off too quickly when not in use, but I can probably fix that in the settings. Overall, I think the product is a fair value at this price point, but don't expect to be up and running within five minutes of opening the box.",4,1,2018-1-30,1,1,0
"I bought this camera for my upcoming honeymoon where we plan to snorkel. Since we will be taking photos underwater, I specifically wanted the dive mode feature. In the Q&A section, a customer asked if this camera had dive mode and Akaso answered saying that it does. This version does NOT have dive mode. After looking into buying filters that I could make fit the housing (there are currently no red filters on the market made specifically for these cameras) I decided it would be cheaper and easier to return this and purchase the Akaso EK7000 Pro.So far I am much happier with the Pro version. I feel like the lighting is better than with the regular EK7000. There are also more settings available.",3,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"If you aren't an everyday surfer or extreme sport fanatic but still want a GoPro style camera, this is perfect. Only came out of the casing once but its been great so far. Mainly using it for capturing media for an everyday vlog, nothing too extreme but it gets banged up a bit.  Came with almost everything I needed sans the tripod but that's no biggie. Has two batteries and a remote plus tons of clips and fixtures. Nice camera, happy I got it.If you're going to vlog, get a tripod and a mic since it doesn't include them. The mic is decent for action but won't catch those nuances like a yeti. Both of these aren't minuses but to be expected.",4,1,2018-8-21,1,0,0
"I am a musician and a YouTuber, I need it a cam that I can attach to my guitar and get some good videos. So far the Akaso EK7000 has giving me good quality video. Since I only need the image I don't use the audio from the Akaso device. I like the control, I can activate the camera to record when I need it. It comes with two batteries, but since I leave it on for one hour, I drain it fast. I do play live so I really need a good battery. I plan to buy another Akaso so I can have more multi angle shoots.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,1
If you are considering this camera don't spend another second thinking about it and Buy it Now! I wasn't sure if this little action sports camera would be any good or not but I can tell you that I am Very Impressed. The camera is easy to use right out of the box and has wifi capabilities to connect to your cell phone to view or upload your pictures or videos. No regrets on this camera! The price is fantastic and it came with a ton of mounting accessories. Works exactly like I had anticipated! I Highly recommend this sports action camera for anyone who is thinking about buying it.

Initially purchased this camera to record basketball games as last year was my first year coaching high school basketball and always found watching footage when I was younger as a useful tool for growth/improvement. I was honestly blown away with the quality of this camera. A buddy of ours has a Go-Pro camera and we compared footage and honestly we were both blown away at how comparable the image/color quality was. With the season being over and my new found love for this camera I even use it for recording family videos. Super happy with my purchase and have recommended this camera to several friends/family. Love that the camera also came with 2 batteries that has been super helpful!,5,1,2019-4-15,1,0,0
Bought this for my girlfriend for our trip to Jamaica. I didn't want to purchase something expensive if she lost or damaged the camera so I went with this. After reading reviews I have to admit I was very impressed with the camera. I actually used it the whole time to document our trip and then create a video of it after. Such a great camera an the watch is great to to start or stop the camera. If you are hesitant about go pro prices like I was do yourself a favor and get this camera it will not disappoint. I read a lot of reviews on this and that's what made me purchase this camera so I hope this gives you a good explanation.,5,1,2017-12-6,1,1,0
"I really wanted an inexpensive action camera, and this fit my needs. It has everything but the memory card you need to get started. I bought a 64 GB Sandisk Ultra Micro SDXC UHS-I card even though the instructions that came with the camera said max of 32 GB for some reason. Everything has worked flawlessly, and the included remote is a great idea when you mount the camera on a helmet and can't get to the buttons. I recorded a few rock climbs in Red Rocks and the videos turned out great, although the color washed out a few times but I'm not sure why. I'm still messing with setting and mounting options to get the best footage.",5,1,2017-12-28,1,1,0
"I purchased two of these cameras. Each came with two batteries, a double battery charger, and several mounts, although I also purchased a bag of mounts. I bought these for bicycling and for the car. The picture quality is excellent. Unknown about the sound quality as the waterproof case blocks a lot of sound. The battery life is the problem for me. The description says they should last 1.5 hours, which is the absolute minimum time I need, but all four batteries lasted less than 1 hour each, so I returned the cameras. If you only need short video time or are not taking many photos, this is an excellent camera, but if you want additional time, look elsewhere.",3,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0
"I bought this almost a year ago, and I still consider it one of my best spent purchases ever. If you are looking for a cheap yet overall good action camera, this is the one for you. This was the third action camera I had bought within the $100 price range and for the price, it was definitely the one that stood out. I was able to compare it side by side with a Hero3, and it stood right up to its $300 dollar predecessor.I am an avid adventurer and one that does go easy on the use of my cameras. I bought this last year with the intent of a cheaper camera that I could put in harm's way. That is what I did. Growing up in the jungles of South America and being able to use this in the jungle setting, I tied it to a tree for monkeys to play with, filmed a piranha underwater with it, and stuck under a Land Rover to get the perfect shot. It has been deep in caves and mounted on sailboats. It literally has gone through about every test an action camera can have, and it has not failed. It is still going strong.",5,1,2017-11-16,1,1,0
"I've been using this camera as both a body cam and a makeshift webcam ever since April, and I've gotta say that I'm extremely happy with it. In daylight, the image quality leaves little to be desired, and even in the semi-dark of an office or bedroom it's still perfectly serviceable. The battery life is long enough for really any extended activity, and it comes with a spare right out of the box, as well as a selection of clips and adapters to mount the camera on all manner of surfaces and harnesses (which aren't included, but hey, it's 50 bucks).Good stuff. Highly recommended.",4,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0

However, I decided against the YouTube channel idea and will use this for family home videos for when we go on trips and cavations (in the farout future, because of coronavirus). It is the perfect travel size and won't take up much room to put in a bag. It is also incredibly light so it won't add anymore weight to a bag that you're carrying. It definitely stables my videos very well, as I have shaky hands sometimes haha. The video quality is pretty good, as I expected for the price. I didn't realy test the water resistance because I had no reason to put it underwater, but the case seems like it would be pretty durable underwater. :)",4,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0

I bought this product for my 12 year old daughter who likes to take pictures. She wanted a camera to use at the pool and small enough to take on vacations to theme parks. I like her to have her own device that would not be a major loss if we lost it - instead of using her cell phone. It was great for candid shots in the pool with her cousins. It was a little difficult to put the memory card in the first time and you must have a memory card ( the camera does not work without one.)Note- it is not waterproof outside of the waterproof case. Also it had way too many accessories and the one thing it really needs is a strap that works with or without the waterproof case. There are straps included but those work with the remote for setting up pictures.,4,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0

"I'm confused how this camera has so many good reviews because it's terrible.  The product outputs a 4K resolution but when you view the video, it is very poor quality.  This is likely because the sensor capturing the video is not really 4k resolution and the software in the camera is adding additional pixels to make a 4k image.  The result is essentially a fuzzy video with lots of random noise added.  Additionally, the compression type is JPEG which is weird in it of itself since most cameras use h.264 compression.",1,1,2017-3-8,1,3,0

"Definitely lives up to that of an action camera. This is your go to for YouTube videos, bikers, skateboarders, and so on. I would only recommend getting an microphone for better sound quality. But it's still worth it all around.UPDATE: 07/26/2020 You cannot buy an external microphone for this camera. Built in microphone is fair so I would not recommend for sports where sound is a key factor.",5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0

The camera quality seems very good as far as we can tell at this point.  And the iOS app is really simple, as was connecting the camera with his phone.Since it is for the motorcycle, the final quality judgement will have to wait until it gets warm and dry enough for him to get out on the bike to see how the image quality is on the road so I can only give it four stars until we try it on the road, but we are pleased with everything we see so far including the price.",4,1,2016-12-26,1,1,0
Came well packaged and was able to get free same day which is always nice. I tested out the camera in my fish-tank worked great with no leaks! The remote is a really nifty addition. I bought for my trip to Puerto Rico so I will leave a better review once I really put it into action. Happy with my purchase and planning to recommend.  Also for those who are paranoid shoppes like myself where you see one bad review and almost want to just not even bother. Take the chance with this one I shopped around a lot and looked up many videos on youtube before deciding to get it. Make sure to pick up a MicroSD I purchased a 32gb Sandisk.,5,1,2017-3-11,1,1,0
"I was in the market for an action camera and after a lot of research, I decided on this one.

It can be used as a normal camera or can be controlled through an app or the remote that was included. The customer service has been fantastic as well. I had an issue with the camera after a couple of years and the support team at Akaso responded promptly to my support ticket and resolved the issue in just a few short emails.

"The camera seemed fine but I can't attest to how well it works due to the fact that the VERY FIRST TIME I used it, it flew off of my helmet! I cleaned my helmet thoroughly and applied the correct helmet mount and allowed to set for 3 days. I mounted the camera and went for a ride. About 10 minutes into the ride, the camera mount peeled off of my helmet and my camera was lost! DO NOT TRUST THEIR ADHESIVE! I can only imagine if this were a $400.00 GoPro! I am sick as it is. I went back and spent 2 hours walking the side of the road looking for it to no avail. All I found was 2 deer carcasses and a bunch of litter. So, there went my new camera AND the 64gb card I bought for it. I am not happy with Akaso! I feel they owe me another camera and memory card. Luckily no one was behind me to have it hit their windshield!",1,1,2017-9-17,1,9,0
"We have been looking for a good underwater camera BUT didn't not want to spend crazy money on GoPros. We looked back and forth on the reviews and watched videos and were still skeptical BUT could not beat the price point of $59 for this underwater camera. We got it in and couldn't wait to go use it. The clear case is durable(not as tight as the gopro's but still tight). Very lightweight, like how compact the batteries and great for storing. Went to the pool to take pictures and videos. Even though the pool was very murky it took GREAT PICTURES and VIDEOS. Seriously good videos. So glad we bought this camera and would buy it again. Not only is it affordable but it actually takes great media!!!We have used a GoPro Hero and what we like compare to this one is the battery life is alot better than the go pro.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,1
"I’ve never owned a GoPro so I don’t know what I’m missing for features.  However for $60 this is a great little camera.  The menus are a little quirky but the quality is decent.  I purchased it to make small short videos of my shop projects and to use as a dash cam on our upcoming cross country trip.Even the batteries perform pretty good. However, if using the highest 4K features they run out quick. I’m using 1080p for my shop projects because post processing is faster.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0
My child requested a Go Pro camera but the price was a little out of my budget for a birthday gift. I found this after researching online and it is exactly what he wanted. He can’t wait to bring it on our next vacation. In the meantime he has been learning how to use it and enjoys taking videos on top of his remote control car while he drives it around! We’ve only had it for a month but it seems to be holding up so far.,5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"This camera is great. It is simple to set up and easy to use. Instructions where easy to understand ( although I could never find an explanation of  what the mini usb port is for.) I found out from trying to get used to it that there is no audio when recording with the waterproof cover on. The audio is exceptional for such a small camera when out of the case. The accessories that cam with it will come in handy I'm sure as I expand my usage.  My only real flaws I see are it doesn't come with an audio port for an external mic, and I had a little trouble getting the micro sd card in and out. The software is a bit sketchy to get used to , but once i figured out the wi-fi it all worked out fine.Buy a card reader if you want to download to pc.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"My 12 year old son wanted a camera to mostly take videos and make videos for YouTube. He did extensive research and found this one. I researched it as well and it seemed like it was a pretty promising camera, but you never really know until you get it and test it out. As soon as we got it, we were both impressed by the 170 degree camera and how easy it was to use. He's used it taking video going down slides and rides at the water park and it has done fantastic in the water. He likes that the batteries are rechargeable and it came with two so you're never without. It's also compatible with his tablet and computer. The picture quality is good and it's so small that it's very easy to carry it around with you. I think we're both pretty impressed by all that it can do, especially since it's so affordable. It's so great that his 8 year brother got one, as well and has loved it just as much. Great camera!",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I use this camera mostly to hang on a fence and record my son’s baseball games. It did everything advertised even though this isn’t the ideal camera for this job. I was able to start, stop and review videos from my iPhone or my android tablet depending on which one I had connected. The battery life wasn’t that great but I was asking a lot out of it, it came with two batteries and a double charger that worked well but I usually used a battery pack and rolled right along. It took a couple shots from balls hitting the back stop and was dropped several time and is still working. Hopefully this fall my son will is it for more of what it was designed for.Main thing is it will record whatever you want it is a wide angle lens so I recommend recording things close to you and you can buy about 4 of these to each GoPro you can buy",4,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
"My husband and I purchased this camera for our son for Christmas and it is still going strong. We didn't want to spend a ton of money being that he is only 10 and this was his first action camera. This thing has been through it all, he took it to Disney with him, attached it to his bike and chest. Basically he uses this any opportunity he gets. Its very easy to upload videos and the picture quality is good. I would definitely recommend this as a first time action camera!",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0

"The device only lasted about 20 mins and overheated so it would shut down. Once I purchased the item I tested it in my house at night in cool weather with no case on and it still overheated...every time I tested it. It was extremely hot to the touch and would require a cool down of about 30 mins before it would stay on.If they can fix the overheating issue this device would be pretty awesome.

MY MIND is bouncing. FULL OF LITTLE KID EXCITEMENT, so just imagine your happiest moment as a kid and how overly excited it made you. Yea, that was me. But the Man I am showed excitement, but not as clear as my mind which is jumping. But i went out after purchasing a SD CARD, which had slightly saddened me, because i was ready for LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION. But couldn’t cause I needed a card, which i had to wait until the next day, No stores open on Christmas WHY!!!!! EVEN WALMART.. SHOCKING!! But after getting a sd card, I was amazed at the stability, and clearness of the camera. Even In motion.. OMG i am AMAZED!!! I APPLAUD HER 100000x for this Excellent Gift.... BUT THIS CAMERA!!!!

"This is the first of two reviews.  I took this camera out on the boat to film fishing for the day.  I have not edited or even viewed the footage, but I can tell you the battery life on the accompanying batteries is very poor compared to a GoPro.  Each battery lasts MAYBE an hour....and those are brand new batteries.  8 hours of filming?  Expect to switch out batteries 8 times.  This is not convenient AT All.",2,1,2017-9-30,1,2,0
"I bought this camera for our Punta Cana trip. I was a little skeptical about the quality of it because of the price. “You got what you pay” - I always say it to my Uber passengers and I think that about the people who wrote a tone of negative feedbacks about the cheapest resort expecting a “Bahamas presidential suite and service”.It says that works great in 30 meters deep water. That’s the only thing that I don’t agree because I couldn’t check it because I don’t dive. I tried 5 feet in the sea but the quality was terrible and that because the water. But I can tell you that it’s really water proof and making unbelievable nice videos and pictures in the pool and outside. I video out parachute fly, it’s great. Even being in the waterproof case it recorded the voice. Even in the pool. So you can use it outside, around the pool , on the beach , in the park , it make very quality videos and photos. For the price that you pay it’s perfect.",5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0
"I bought this specifically to use on my motorcycle rides. Camera records great, but there are some issues. First if you use the waterproof case for the camera you can't have it plugged in to charge. Second, if you remove the battery from the camera it loses time/date and you have to reset it each time; so that is a low point. Third, the sound recording is not good at all when you have the camera in its waterproof case, too much crackling heard on recordings.",3,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"Where do I start? This camera is excellent for the price. You have two recording modes..720P(60FPS) & 1080P(30FPS)... the 4K options are not available on this exact model, however the 720p and the 1080p are excellent and very clear.. the stabilization is fair, I really can't judge it completely because I brought it and used it on a jet ski with a friend's waterproof chest mount. It comes with two batteries would hold a very good charge for continuous recording. If you want a HD action camera this is the one to get save yourself a lot of money. Don't waste your money on the competitors $200 to $400 models, trust me you will be happy with the quality of this one, and I also forgot to mention it comes with a wrist mounted wireless remote control that you can start and stop the recording by pushing a button, the wireless wrist control is not waterproof, this camera has all the features or at least most of the features of the big boys.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,1
"I always like to wait reviewing item like this until I have used it for a while. I didn't drop this or anything but it's not working right , it freezes up in normal temperature inside. Also , when water proof case is put on , you can not hear anything on video. I found this out very early on. It's too late to return it or get a refund , so I have to eat the cost on this.",1,1,2017-12-14,1,2,0
"After spending years buying expensive GoPro cameras and them failing over and over I decided to go with this camera. Figured, why not? And to my surprise, this is my go-to cam when doing anything. Hell, I use it more than my phone or point and shoot Nikon when I want to capture great video. I plan on buying another one soon so I can attach it to my drone because my drone cam sucks and it's so lightweight that a bee could carry it.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
Wanted to get a camera for posting on YouTube. For $60 this camera works. No bells and whistles but works. The interface is a bit clunky and the camera buttons take a little getting used to but it works fine. If you’re needing a sports action camera spend $15 more for the pro version. Sound isn’t great but like everything on this camera it’s OK. Using iMovie on an iPad I’m able to edit video just fine. Best $60 camera out there.,5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
have not even put the battery in and Iam off to a bad experience. The app is rated a 2.5 stars(RED FLAG). Went thru 3 cameras because the apps sucked or did not even work!! They should have in BOLD red letters NO SD card!!! come on guys. 5 days later I am ordering it. All the little adapters and tools are confusing( some) . Thank god for youtube.

I bought this camera last fall and only used two times. During the first time use everything was ok. This summer I tried to use it and found the remote was dead. Replacing battery did not help.After I adjust the date and time now the screen is black after a flash of the model string. The top red light is on but the action button shows no response.

"I got this to record videos for youtube.  So far it works great.  The accessory pack is good, but the case is not the best.  The clamp that holds the back in place came apart the first time I opened it.  Still functions, but not the best.  The sound is typical for an action camera, very muffled.  Picture quality is okay, but the 4K does not seem native.  The menu is not user friendly.  The battery hatch is hard to open, and when it does open it is not attached.  Other than that, it will work for me.",4,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"If you are hesitant to purchase this low priced sports cam don't be, it is a great value.  The cam is small, super lightweight and works great.  The wide angle lens truly is wide angle and takes very high quality photos and videos.  The system is very easy to use and intuitive.  Didn't have to even read the manual to get started.The cam comes with 2 batteries, compact fast charger, waterproof housing, remote, and an accessory bundle that includes all types of mounts including handlebar mounts.  Out of the box, the batteries only took 30 minutes to charge and they lasted for 5-6 hours a piece.  I use a 64 GB microSD card, a bargain at $15, and it will record 6 hours of video at 1080p resolution.  The waterproof housing has buttons that are easy to use with gloves on.  The remote is even water resistant and has big easy to use buttons to take either photos or videos.",5,1,2018-10-16,1,0,0
I am happy with the camera as it is a nice small camera with a lot accesories included. For the price is great quality so you can have your action camera for a good price with 2 batteries. I don't like that is not touch screen and there are not good instructions but YouTube has all the information to use it. Also the batteries last better that the expensive brand. The quality of video is ok.,5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"For the price, this camera is stunning. The included accessories are extremely nice to have. Video and picture quality are amazing. I've been putting this in my bird feeder for short amounts of time and have had some great results so far.I do wish this camera was able to shoot in 4k at 60fp, and I wish the lens was changeable with a focus feature. Though, for the price of this camera, it's exceeded my expectations wildly.",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"So, the reason I bought this camera was that it boasted the ability as being a webcam. It does work as a webcam, but the cord is really short (around 23''), and the physical connection is terrible (cuts out frequently). Another issue is that the screen looks not that great, but you can make out what your looking at. Accessing the media involves pressing the 'up' button and then the front power button (which I found out by pressing stuff). I believe the resolution can only be changed using the app 'Akaso DV' I think. The general usability is not great.If you want a fairly inexpensive camera featuring some useful mounts, this device will suit your needs. Since this has no reliability as a webcam, I will be returning it. Some captures I took writing this are included (pardon the mess). Overall 3/5.",3,1,2020-9-3,1,0,1
"I bought this camera to mount on my bicycle ""just in case"" I have an incident involving a motorist or a dog. Using a combination of the various mounting options included with the camera, I was able to attach it to the handlebar stem where is it convenient to operate. It works great for that purpose.I also plan to use it with the waterproof case when we go snorkeling in the Caribbean later this year.",4,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"This camera is a great go pro alternative, its cheaper, smaller, and easier to mount. The camera has WiFi connection so someone on a phone can see whats going on the camera and you can also control it with the phone. Its waterproof case allows you to go underwater and protect it from damage as well. I think its a very neat device and its worth the money. You get a ton of mounting options too that allows you to mount to bikes, tripods, and even a stand just to hold it up. I think this is a great choice as far as action cameras go. I would highly recommend this product to any adventurers out there.",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,1
"I wanted an Action Camera for Christmas and was super excited when I was gifted the Akaso Action Camera EK7000. I have to admit, when I opened the box and seen the contents, I was a little intimidated at first .... so I put the camera aside seeing that I might need a couple of hours to figure it out, LOL. I've decided to learn my new toy today. I started reading the owner manual, but decided it'd probably be faster to see tutorials left on YouTube by other users, which it was! After watching a few videos on YouTube, I definitely had a better understanding of how to format the SD Card, and how to use the multiple accessories included with the camera. It's fairly easily to operate with only 4 buttons on the camera. It's definitely a great value and I recommend this to anyone whose into recording simple action videos (like myself).

The camera works really well out of the box and he has already gotten some great video of our kittens and the other kids using their new stuff.

"Shipping was a bit delayed. Over all, a good camera. It overheated on my first go around floating a river, and it kept shuttingoff. Water proofing works well, but the housing steams up and made the video foggy. Some different mounts would be great, but I made due. Over all, heck yes! I'll keep using it! Picture quality outside water proof case was amazing!I found out the camera wasn't shutting off. The screen goes black but continues to record. I'm assuming to save batteries",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0

"I purchased this a while back as a low-cost camera to use for my next diving trip. I confess that I do not have a GoPro to compare this to but I have used this camera on two consecutive dives and I must say that I truly love this camera. I found that it was easy to read when I was underwater (the only small bit of confusion was that the screen goes out after a few seconds making me think the camera stopped recording, which was not the case) and I was able to start and stop the recording easily during the dive. The images at 1080p are very nice. Note: although the instructions said it only used up to 32GB memory cards I tossed in a 64GB and it said that I have 7 1/2 hours of recording time on 1080p (note that the battery lasted about an hour recording at that resolution). So, the 64GB memory did work although I have not done the math to see if it gave me the full 64GB.I have pleasantly surprised at the quality of this camera that is a fraction of the cost. One drawback I found was that the menu is a little bit clunky but with the book I was able to figure it out. I can't wait for my next trip to try out this great camera.",5,1,2017-8-10,1,1,0
"I was super stoked I bought this because of the price and the 4.4/5 stars, and I was going to use this as a trail cam for my jeep. I took it for a test drive and right away I noticed issues. When I loaded it up on my computer, the audio and video was super choppy. So I recorded like a 20 second clip in my room and found that for some reason the 30 fps works better than the 60 fps. After the third test I tried, I went to turn on the camera and the screen stayed black. I took the SD card out and the screen worked fine, however when I try to insert the SD card it shuts itself off, and keeps staying black when I turn it on with the SD card in the camera.

The main reason for the purchase is I wanted a camera to be able to take under water to snap some pics while snorkeling. I did do a test check on the waterproof case at home and it worked perfectly. The one thing I would like to see made available as an accessory for the camera is some filters, specifically a red filter for using underwater.

It got tossed around in the surf with no problems.  The only thing that I would say is do get an anti-fogging solution.  It did get a touch of condensation in the housing when in the surf, but even those pictures turned out pretty well.  The remote control is a nice thing to have.  Getting the pictures off the camera was also pretty easy.  You can download an app and transfer the pictures to your phone via WiFi or manually with an SD card.

I bought a case full of more accessories, many of which won't be used, but the carrying case itself is good to have for keeping all the items safe and handy. The reason I left off stars is because as soon as I received the camera and replaced the battery,  the tab on the door for the battery compartment snapped right off!

Paying more than $300 for a camera that I was not going to use on a regular basis seemed too much for me. Then, I came across with Akaso EK7000 with great reviews and ratings. It greatly exceeded my expectations, and I was highly impressed by the product. With a variety of mounts and cases, this camera gave us flexibility to use under water, walking on the streets, hiking and even as a dash cam for the scenic drives.Hoping that the pandemic subsides soon so we can use the camera again.",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"I didn't realize this camera didn't have an external mic.  However, the pictures are gorgeous and the cost makes it very accessible.  You can't capture audio when it is in a sealed box anyhow, and that is how I have been using it.  Because the cost is so low, I feel much more comfortable using it in more situations where the camera may take a hit.  It hasn't taken a hit yet, so I can't say anything to it's durability.  I have recorded about 40G of video through it.  The app is VERY helpful.  I liked the camera enough that I purchased another one with an external mic and speaker.  The one app runs both cameras.  Now an Akaso fan!",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I am putting 5 Stars because people wont read bad reviews. Beware, this company's quality control is all most none existent. The camera delivered to me was not working properly. It would fail to turn on with fully charged batteries. The only way to coax the camera into turning on was to put batteries fresh of the charger and put it on right after installing it. And even then, I had mixed results. This camera's resolution isn't 4K or even close. Its 1080p at 22 mbps video upscaled to 4K resolution. That causes grainy footage and photos. Also, at 1080p the quality is still subpar. The main reason others are putting 5 star reviews is because in the camera's box, it ask for you to leave a 5-star review and you can get free camera stuff. For example, batteries and charger, more accessories, and more mounts. They ask for a screenshot and the order number.PLEASE BEWARE!",5,1,2018-1-14,1,2,0
"Out of the box, easy to set up.  Nice variety of accessories included. You will need to buy a microSD card. This camera has  WiFi. You can control/view with your phone. I am going to use mine as a backup camera to connect trailers to my vehicle and as a dash cam (continuous loop mode). Even if it does not last, I can buy 6 of these for the price of one GoPro.  This camera also uses the same quick disconnect mount that GoPro uses.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"I'm using this product to record my wood work projects.  The super clear image of the camera is great to capture the detail of my projects.

"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son to use while downhill skiing.  He tested it out in the house as well as on trips to the mailbox and the camera seemed to work fine.  However, on his first skiing trip the unit powered on and he started recording, but sometime during that process it shut off and the recording was lost.  The unit would not power back up.  On his second trip he was able to record about a 5 minute video before it shut off.  Very disappointed.  I realize it is winter, but no where did I see any information about operating temperatures.I plan on returning this camera for a replacement.  Hopefully there is an issue with this unit.  I will update this review if my 2nd attempt is any better.",2,1,2018-1-2,1,1,0
Only just recently turned it on but seems what I expected. Only issue I had was trying to figure exactly how all the accessories worked but a quick search on youtube helped figure that out. App doesn't seem to work or connect to camera but plugged into my computer and was able to view and delete videos/pictures so I think I'll be ok. More to come with this but so far what I expected for what I paid.,4,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0
ORIGINAL:  The camera clip that comes with this does not fit the camera therefor all of the other attachments (except the water proof case) are useless.

I will also be keeping one in my vehicle as well.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Received the camera today and I have to say wow. The camera performed better than expected for the price. I use the phone app to control the camera while riding my bike and works great.

Batteries took minutes to fully charge for their first use.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,1
"This camera works really well. When I first saw the price I though ""this can't be that good,"" so I looked at the reviews and they were pretty solid. Once I got it, I tuned it on and even though it didn't have an SD card, I could still see the screen and the footage looked really good. I tested the water proof case and several of the mounts and they all worked fine. I am satisfied with this camera and may buy again if I need another one.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"I am very satisfied with the purchase of this camera. Intending to record some videos for potential posting on the web, I wanted one of these small cameras and did a little research. This camera had good reviews so I got one. Overall, I am happy with its ability. Although I'm no professional, the colors in the videos are very vibrant. The camera comes with a good selection of mounting accessories so I mounted it to a bicycle to take videos of my rides. They are very nice, and, using Kdenlive, I'm able to stabilize the videos for decent playback (bicycle videos are very shaky). Battery life is about 1 hour and recharges fine with the supplied charger. For a budget outdoor camera, I feel that this is a very good value and am happy with the purchase.",5,1,2018-7-24,1,0,0
"My first one drained the battery while it was unplugged. Charged it at night, in the morning it was dead. Tried this multiple times, same thing every time. I exchanged it for a new one. That one was broken in the box. The video quality is fairly low, unless you use it as a stationary camera. I ended up getting a gopro hero 6. It was significantly more money. But in this case, you get what you pay for. This $80 action camera is the quality of an $80 action camera. Which is fine if that is what you want. It didn't fit my needs unfortunately.",2,1,2018-1-30,1,1,0
If you are thinking of buying this item because you want a GoPro for cheap then you will be  disappointed.  IF you are looking for a versatile camera that can take a beating then this is it.  The box comes with a variety of connections and mounts as well as a wrist mounted remote control.  The built in rear screen is great for ensuring that the camera is correctly positioned to catch the shot you want.  I cant wait to mount this on my road bike as an extra bit of insurance.  I will post some videos from the bike ride once they are edited.,4,1,2019-8-16,1,0,1
"Excellent Camera. It takes great pictures. Great under water pictures with ease. The one drawback is the lack of easy to understand the supplied instructions.

"So I bought this camera as a way to take photos when I took my 2yr old kayaking.  I wanted something I didnt have to worry about if we tipped over (which we didnt).  Everyone was telling me to get a GoPro because they are completely reliable.  Well, I wasnt paying GoPro prices for a few uses.  Needless to say, it is the best thing I purchased for this trip.  Came with plenty of accessories and straps.  Even came with a back up door in case the one on the water proof case was damaged.  Only thing, it does not come with a description of usage for the accessories.  But  that will not be a deterrent for me to suggest it to my friends.",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"Before I deciding to make a purchase of EK7000, I was a little hesitant to about if 64gb microSDXC card would be compatible with this camera because I think 32gb would be too small for me since I'm planning to go to the South East Asia for a month. After reading majority of this product reviews on Amazon and other sites, only one person comment mentioned about 64gb compatibility out of hundred comments.  I took a chance and bought two microSD 64gb along with the EK7000 camera.  Both shipped in the same package.After unboxing the Amazon shipping box, I found the  camera dismounted from its black base casing. This was due to shipping & handling from Amazon but can also be blaming on the cheap plastic made itself.  Opened the camera and there were A LOT of accessories that came with it that other reviewers were right about. I don't think I will be needing all of them but nice options to have. An excellent decision made by Asako.",5,1,2017-9-13,1,1,0
"A camera that doesn't sacrifice function for affordability. With the AKASO EK7000 you can get a great 4k action camera at the fraction of the price compared to some of the other cameras. I was hesitant at first based at the cost but after getting and using my camera I couldn't be happier. Looking forward to using it during scuba diving during our up coming cruise and all our future family vacations. If you are looking for a 4k action camera that doesn't break the bank, the AKASO EK7000 is the camera for you!",5,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
"Compared to the GoPro, this camera is legit. It has the same specs as a gopro 5 with 4K video and 12mp. Im satisfied with it especially for the price. The sound is even pretty good when it's not in the waterproof case. I wish it had better instructions as they basically say how to turn it on and record, not edit, or anything else. The WiFi app doesn't work at all so loading straight to your phone won't happpen.  It can only be done by transfering it manually, but that's fine for me because I plan on editing on my laptop for youtube. Instructons on the accessories would be very helpful as I'm not sure how to use many of them. Verdict: great adventure camera and the price gives it an edge over gopro in my opinion.",4,1,2018-2-3,1,0,0
We are going skiing and biking quite often and like to use an action camera to capture the fun moments. I’ve decided to give a try to the akaso sport action camera and extremely happy with it.The camera comes with quite many accessories which are easy to mount and very useful for different type of footage ( we tried to mount it on a bike steering and now on the helmet),5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"The remote... I had it strapped to my palm, and felt like Peter Parker/Spiderman. Snapping picks or taking video with a tap of the finger, like web swinging for the pics and vids I wanted. The Down side was the battery life, they do give you two batteries, so that closed the gap for me from the three stars to four. The camera also seems to get a little/very warm when recording vids. Bottom line, great first time action cam for price. Will definitely be recommending this to my family and friends. My father in law is probably getting one for this upcoming father's day. Thanks for reading, written by husband, so husband approved....... pending CFO approval AKA the wife.",4,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0
"Battery life was good for about 50 minutes of recording for the first outing, 60 the 2nd, and 70 the third. The image quality was very clear in daylight but recording through sunset without changing the settings resulted in a very dark video by the end.The casings and mountings appear to be of very high quality. I've taken a few hits and dropped them a couple of times without damaging them.

"I’ve been in the market for an Action Cam for a while now, I do a lot of fishing and have been getting into photography/videography a lot lately. But I haven’t been able to bring myself to spend the money on the newest GoPro, so in my search for alternatives I came across this camera, and I was intrigued. I mean, surely this cam cant compare to the GoPro, as its only a fraction of the cost, right?? I read reviews, I researched the specs, and bc of the price, I decided to pull the trigger and take a chance. It arrived yesterday, and i was immediately impressed when I unboxed it. It had basically the same design and presentation as the GoPro, AND it came with a number of mounts, as well as a waterproof casing. A side by side picture comparison to the GoPro Hero 8 blew my mind, as you couldn’t tell which was which. I definitely recommend getting this camera, and trying it out.

"For the price, this little camera is great! Mounted it to my seadoo and just blasted around the lake. I even tested it out with a few underwater videos and pictures. It's exactly what I needed. Sound quality is ok. But I wasn't really looking for that. You can still hear sounds with the waterproof case on. Also it floats! Comes with a bunch of different mounts. Overall I was stoked when I got this. Battery life is short lived. But they supply you with two batteries.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,1
"The image quality is good and it comes with a lot of cool accessories, but it doesn't have sound. I thought it was just the waterproof case causing the sound to be blocked or muffled, but even without a case on, there is very muffled sound. It is essentially no sound. I wouldn't expect top quality sound, but there is none. Not sure if that is a defect, I've emailed the addresses listed on the manufacturer's site for support, but haven't heard back.*Update: I heard back from their customer support who were very helpful and responsive. They sent a new camera and an RMA for the old one. The new one works better. The sound with the waterproof case on is still very muffled but I assume that is to be expected. The trade off for being waterproof. Out of the case, the sound is much clearer. Overall they have very good customer service.",4,1,2017-11-5,1,1,0
"I wanted to get an action camera for a trip but was hesitant to spend the money to get a go pro- this was the perfect solution! Couldn't ask for anything better especially for the price. Similar features to the go pro- can take pictures, videos, bursts, self timer, etc. Comes with a ton of accessories- even more than I know what to do with! But especially like the water proof case and multiple batteries.Only downfalls- when you turn it on, it automatically takes you to video, so you have to make sure you click the button to get on camera mode. Took some accidents videos. Also, picture quality is great for the price but would probably be crisper with go pro.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"I bought this to capture rides on my motorcycle and action shots at sporting events. I could not be more pleased with the way this action cam performs. The images are excellent. Even clamped to my motorcycle, the video is clear and almost no vibration registers. It even picks up great sound quality. This camera performs well beyond the price I paid for it and I am considering getting one or two more to improve my videos in the future.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I got this for the purpose of a helmet camera because I ride a motorcycle. The image quality is not bad at 1080p/60fps. Any lower video quality it’s is not worth it (if you’re using it for “action camera” purposes). But for my purposes (dash-cam/helmet purposes) its ok. Not the best by any means but it serves it’s purpose. Have not tried the 4K because I doubt the little screen on the camera can display 4K and neither can my computer or phone screen so a review on the 4K would be naïve of me. The battery life is sub-par to say the least, in my opinion which at 1080p/60fps lasts a solid hour. But hey, for 60$ serves the purpose that I use it for so I can’t complain.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"This GoPro knock off was unfortunately junk from the start. I took it on a backpacking trip abroad. On the first use, the unit overheated and turned off after about 15 minutes of on/off shooting. Some of the videos wound up being corrupt on the memory card. On the second use, the interface froze twice during recording, causing the loss of more video.Furthermore, each battery barely manages to get through 20 minutes of recording. So it's effectively useless.",1,1,2017-12-13,1,1,0
"Was looking for a little camera to use mainly for taking videos in my kitchen to blend with my iPhone videos for creating posts for my blog.  So far, it’s worked great.  My first comment is that when purchasing this, be sure to grab an adapter to more quickly download the videos/photos from the camera to your iPad/Laptop so you’re not sitting around for hours waiting for them to download via WIFI.  The other comment is that i wish i could turn off the 170* angle to get some tighter shots, but maybe that’s deeper in the online instruction manual that I’m still reading through.  Would like to be able to add that setting to get some tighter shots for what I’m working on in my kitchen.",4,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0

"This has been a great camera on our vacations. Purchased a waterproof housing and it works great. The sound, with or without a housing, is terrible.

I’m impressed. I bought this to record off-road videos on my Jeep. The picture is actually as good as my GoPro.

However, I think I'll be able to get some really good hunting videos with these things, especially with two of'em. I'm not a big tech guy, in fact this is my first action camera, so I can't compare it to another of it's kind, but if you're looking to buy such a camera and don't care about having the popular name brand (GoPro) then I would suggest this one.

Just received my new little Akaso EK7000.  I'm going on a trip and already have a 4k camera but needed one that was water proof so I purchased this one. It's a cool little camera. The video quality is not fantastic but for what I need it for it's perfect. I'm not spending $500 on a go pro when all I need is this.  Build quality is good and it comes with a bunch of attachments including a 2 station battery charger.  For the price I can't complain at all.  The battery lasts about 45 minutes on 2k 30 which is great.  4k quality was a little choppy but 2k 30 and 1080P 60 were fine for what I need.  I plan to use this all the time when going in the water!  I gave this a 4 star because of the price.  I have a few high end cameras but nothing I can get wet.

This is small, light weight, and simple to function. I synced it to my phone to view VDO and it’s great. I run it on 720p with 64 GB card and that gives me over 8 hours of recording. 2 batteries are nice for longer day. Highly recommended especially for $50.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"I am amending the review written below. Almost a year later I received a response from the seller. I was sent a replacement. I will be giving this to my son as a gift to replace the one he received last year. Once we see how this one works, I will again update this review. I appreciate the seller’s response.This worked fine for the first month. My son’s birthday was 1/25 and the window for return ended 2/24. Now it won’t work and the back is constantly popping off. Very disappointed and wish I had taken heed to the other reviews.",1,1,2018-3-25,1,1,0
"I realised that most of the reviews online on this camera are not honest. The supplier leaves you a written message in the box promising you lots of free accessories if you give them a positive rating and they ask you to email them confirming you gave a positive review! No wonder why this poor camera with bad recording quality has so many positive replies. I am so disappointed with the quality, the image is so grainy and sound quality is bad. It's a very basic and poor entry level camera. Dont get cheated",2,1,2019-5-19,1,2,0
"After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"The camera was as expected and advertised.  Company stands behind their products and are good to deal with.  The camera takes wonderful, high quality videos with good sound.  Very satisfied customer.  Much less expensive than the Go Pro.  Camera will link up to your smartphone for control viewing, start/stop recording.  Underwater capability.  What more can you expect?  Terrific buy - thanks!",5,1,2018-11-26,1,1,0
"We got this for my 11yr old son to use attached to his dirt bike helmet. It came with everything we needed for easy installation. We definitely recommend! We will definitely purchase more products In The future. Picture quality is very good, it came with a case that saved us a lot with mud and water splatter. My son takes some falls and it still holds up!",4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I was looking for a wearable camera so I can video my fearful dog training so I can learn and hopefully help others. Some other cameras were very expensive, but I did need a very good quality camera for my needs. After searching the many cameras and looking through reviews, pricing, capabilities, I decided on this camera. There were so many accessories in the box, there will be endless possibilities to get good pictures and video. Right out of the box, I was able start recording and the picture was clear and definitely will be easy to use and easy for my other dog trainers to see. The instructions were easy to read and I had no problems going through the settings. I would definitely recommend this camera to novice and advanced users - great value for a very reasonable price",5,1,2017-3-28,1,2,0
"You can't beat what you're getting for your dollar. I was looking for something to use an a multi-purpose action camera. I wanted to be able to run time-lapses in rough weather. The camera comes with a handful of accessory mounts which make it out of the box able to snap onto a wide variety of items. The 4k@30fps video looks great, I personally prefer the 1080p@60fps for the majority of my usage, but I do see it has a higher frame rate 720p@120fps but I haven't been able to run that through its paces yet. Overall I'm very pleased with the quality of the camera and for such an amazing price when compared to their competitors. Well worth your money!",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
I've been wanting a camera so I can record family vacations and everyday family outings. I bought this Camera on a spur of the moment because I usually research before I buy. So far I'm impressed with video quality and the amount of accessories that came with it. This is my first action camera. The camera itself was easy to understand just after a few mins of messing with it. Like others have mentioned it does not come with a micro SD card and recording sound is hard to hear when inside the waterproof case. One of the accessories that comes with the camera is a backing plate that has two holes cut into it. These holes allow sound to enter the case so it can be heard better on camera. Just remember to switch the backing plate to the solid one without the holes in case you take it near water so it can be waterproof again.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

"This camera does exactly what I needed it to do!  Great youtube-ready video quality, clear sound even in waterproof case, battery will last for about 2 hours of nonstop filming, with a backup charged battery to swap out if needed.  We film fishing youtube videos, and so far have filmed in the ocean waves, rivers, on our kayaks, and even on our go-pro dog harness.  Very pleased with everything we've captured so far on this very affordable go-pro alternative!Fits all go-pro mounts for easy accessorizing!",5,1,2017-12-26,1,1,0
Couldnt get it to work right. Battery didnt last over 1 hr after charging how would I use it on the job site if I cant get it to turn on long enough to take a video clip after charging. Maybe mine was defective? I dont know I returned it for my money back.,2,1,2019-7-31,1,1,0
"Great value for the price!  Easy to use and amazingly affordable.  I found all the accessories overwhelming And no instructions but there are many YouTube videos available to help you with them.  I would like to give 5 stars but the cover to my battery snapped and I can’t get it to fit securely. Really a bummer.  I went through all the accessories today, took me several hours and I was going to do a video.  Then the cover for the battery snapped and now I’m bummed.  I was supposed to go water rafting this weekend and I’m going to have to tape it shut. BUMMER",4,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera for my husband and kids to use on our vacations. My 12 year old son was able to film and edit with no problems. My husband recorded a hunting trip and was able to bring the footage home for the entire family view on the TV. It was great to see the entire hunt from start to finish. We will be using for all of our Hunting, camping and vacation trips in the future. Very easy to use. Great product for the price!",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Don't want to talk too much about it. Bottom line, if you take this camera cold places where outside temperature below 0 C / 32F think again.  I took mine last week when I went to Utah for skying . It would not work. When you turn it on it comes on but few seconds later it shuts itself off with some warning that I could not even tell. Later I tried to test it in my hotel room and it worked without any issue. So I figured that when you take it outside and especially when you ski the battery can't provide enough power to keep it running an I did make sure it was fully charged. Piece of garbage. Adding few hundreds more and getting good quality camera not this cheap crap.",1,1,2019-3-4,1,1,0
"Bought this camera to get underwater shots based on the reviews. The picture quality is abhorrent. This is definitely not a 12MP camera. I should know, my phone has one. The quality of aperture and light balancing on this camera makes me feel like i'm back in the late 1990s with a disposable camera.Getting a refund on this and will never think about buying Akaso again.",1,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"Excellent price, comes with tons of accessories, appears to be a good quality little camera. Compared it to the gopro and while the video quality and features aren't as high or numerous, for a pre-teen it's priced great and has better quality than expected. This is one that if she breaks I won't have a heart attack and it can be easily replaced, also cool that many of the accessories are interchangeable with GoPro so if I decided to upgrade I wouldn't have to throw everything out.",5,1,2017-11-16,1,1,0
"The camera came in faster than expected, which was nice. Overall, the quality of the camera is nice and sturdy and comes with a whole bunch of accessories.I attached to this camera to my helmet, after about 3 hours of riding a piece from one of the attachments broke off my helmet. I was on a 3 lane road with cars going over 40mph+, the cars ran over my camera multiple times. I was able to find my camera, thankfully still in tact, with only a minor scratch on it. After being ran over it still works just fine.",4,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"I bought this as a gift for my husband, on cyber Monday. I have prime and it shipped faster than had anticipated. He is very pleased with it. I have to note that we are VERY new to the Go-Pro world. When it arrived it was packed nice and neatly with the camera visibly displayed in a plastic cover. It came with a lot of neat attachments (most of which we still have yet to use.) He carried it around and video taped us swimming in Grand Caymans, and doing a submarine excursion with our kids.I'm sure it isnt the best quality, but it worked out great for us, with no complaints.",4,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0
"I bought this for our 11 year old for Christmas. He loves it. His only complaint is that he wants a chest harness rather than a bracket on his bike, dirt bike, helmets etc., one chest harness could cover several different uses. I couldn't figure out how to make one out of the straps that came with the camera but I'm sure we'll figure something out. It was a good price for an entry level camera for a kid. I'm sure adults would enjoy it too, we just needed something that we could handle getting lost or broken and this was a perfect gift.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I bought this camera to replace a larger, handheld style video camera that we use to record school events, sporting events and our travel experiences. So far, I am very impressed. I did not want to spend the $$$ on the popular name brand action camera and the price point on this unit was great! The video and audio quality are excellent and it came with a lot of accessories. If you are looking for a great camera at a very affordable price, look no further.",5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"UPDATE* The battery issue was resolved by the company. Their customer service is hands down the best around!*** Video quality is great. Works well enough for the price. The batteries didn’t last long, thankfully it comes with two. Connecting it is a pain in the butt and the password to hook to the WiFi wasn’t included so I had to google it. Works as expected.",4,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"From what Ive seen in video quality the GoPro's color is more accurate to real life and not so saturated. But, it is more expensive and all attachments seem to be compatible so thats a plus. It also comes with a built in lcd screen so you can actually see what you're trying to do. This camera does a great job for $80. It came with a few attachments, enough to make a buttstock mount, another mount to attach to my tripod, one to attach to a barrel or rod, a watch to control the camera, and few more odd ends. If you leave a review you get another mount for free and I will choose the chest strap.",5,1,2017-2-6,1,1,0
"Excellent camera especially for the price!  Works well and easily with the Akaso phone (Android) app so I can take before and after underwater pictures of the growth on boat running gear, or I can show the customer real-time images of exactly what I am seeing underwater.  Akaso recommends only using the 32Gb micro chip which is what I'm using with great results.  Also purchased underwater LED light attachment- much needed in the dark green waters of the Chesapeake Bay and tributaries.  Yes, would buy again.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,1
"This is my first action camera. This one is perfect for me. I did not want to spend a fortune before I knew how often I would use the camera.  I use it while stand up paddle boarding and kayaking. The quality of the video is good for the price. It comes with some great accessories to start. It is easy to use. I have been impressed.Update: After several months of use, I am still impressed with the quality of the video and how ease the camera is to use. Editing video with a Ipad is easy. The sound is not great, especially if you have the waterproof case on. So think of this for capturing great action not sound. Overall I am very pleased and would recommend.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"""You get what you pay for!"".  No directions with product and it comes with tons of attachments that we have no idea what they're for.  Tried to link to the app on our phones but it wants to be plugged in and we have Google phones, so cannot connect.  We went in cruise and tried using snorkeling but couldn't tell when was recording.  Had to wait until we got home to connect with computer.  Turns out, only thing that recorded was me turning the product on before our excursion.  In our situation, it was a waste for us.",2,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0

All are 128gb and they all work! 1080p 60fps looks good for my application though and it will last longer too! Happy it comes with 2 batteries too! I will set up on my boat with cable to charge while I fish, but when I'm on the shore I will have plenty of battery and space! Might buy another, but I might go for the 1080p one for $45 instead of $70.",4,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
"This camera at first seemed overwhelming to learn from the instruction Manuel. But once I started to use it, the camera just made sense and was easy for me to use! I highly recommend this product, it is well worth your money and is very easy to use as well as being inexpensive compared to other cameras. However it doesn’t come with an SD card but it when the camera came the SD card (I separately ordered) was in the same box so it was no inconvenience. This camera is great for travel too and is very light weigh which I love! It’s video quality is astonishing and I’m very pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2019-7-6,1,0,0
"I got this right before we left for a cruise, and we loved it! My kids enjoyed using it in the ocean for snorkeling and taking pictures of starfish. I love that it has a screen so you can see what you are doing. It was very easy to learn and use, and since it’s something we will only use a few times a year, I am very happy with the purchase and the price!",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
I bought this for my 11 year old for her birthday.  We previously had a Hero5 that broke and wanted to try this before spending hundreds of dollars again.  We are not disappointed!

"The Aakso EK7000 is as advertised, a camera that performs exceptionally for its price. I got mine for $42.00 during a deal day.  The picture quality is good, but could use additional exposure settings. The video quality is good but could use improvement in lower light situations. Video stabilization is average but useable. Over all I would recommend this camera for those just getting started in action based pictures and video. A good all-around performer at a great price!",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

I bought this camera specifically to swim with/ get wet. It served its purpose. I couldn’t justify paying that much for the go pro. You can see water can collect on the outside of the waterproof case it goes in. Make sure the case is free of water on the outside before taking the pic. The go pro doesn’t need the water proof case. Quality is decent. We did cliff jumping and the case held up well. (Won’t allow me to upload a video). Overall it was a good purchase.,4,1,2019-6-16,1,0,1
"This is my first action camera and was excited to open and play with it. After checking out the reviews of others on the product, I felt I will make a positive decision to purchase the Akaso EK7000. My first impressions was great with how the price and its capabilities that is comparable to the GoPro. So I will stick with this and if it breaks, i wouldn't be too bothered.When I first connected it with my smartphone, it kind of had a lag in video, but i love the fact that this device has that feature. My kids were amazed that the video can be viewed on the smartphone quickly or on real time.",5,1,2017-1-19,1,1,0
"Great camera for the price! Bought it to install on my bike helmet to record my rides. Took it for a spin and it works great. The setup is easy and instructions are easy to follow. The Wifi connection works similar to bluetooth connectivity for other devices and along with the iSmart DV app (download require) it's great to view live what the camera is recording/viewing on your phone or tablet. NO, you don't connect it to your internet Wifi to function, it appears the camera puts out a Wifi connection to connect to your smart devices. I have not used the camera for long periods of time but one battery lasted for my 1hr 10 min bike ride. The cool thing is that the camera comes with 2 batteries. Looking forward to use this during the summer and try it in our pool. Will update when we get in the water.If you are looking for a decent camera that is not going to break the bank, this is it.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,1
"This is a great action camera. The video is super clear and the audio is great if there is no background noise. If there is background noise, it does not tune it out. So some of the video we have shot using this camera the audio is terrible. You cannot hear over the background noise. I do love this camera. It is easy to use and it takes great pictures and video. I just wish the audio was better, which is why I am giving this camera 4 stars instead of 5. Battery life is about an hour and 15 minutes or so.

He's done some great work in our fish tank.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I waited too long to get a small, mobile camera, and I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. It goes with me on bike rides, hikes, climbs, and will be my ski accessory. Like the Minox of 40 years ago, you can always have it with you, mounted where you can use it continuously. Each battery gives a little more than an hour of recording. The accessories kit is comprehensive, supporting mounting in just about any situation, with or without the waterproof enclosure.Great value for the money.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0

If you’re a first time user I definitely recommend. If you’re looking for more bells and whistles I’d recommend moving up to the pro , which I feel is still a great value. It comes with a good amount of accessories but there are very comprehensive accessory kits available and very affordable. I definitely recommend",4,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"I primarily bought this camera as a cheaper alternative compared to a GoPro to go fishing with. However, I have mostly used it as a dash cam in my car. Out of the box, with the video setting set at its highest, I was only able to capture 2 videos of about 25 mins each before the batteries died on a full charge. I have since bought more extra batteries, and set the video one resolution down from the best and have had longer battery life as a result. This is my biggest gripe other than having to reset the date and time everytime I have to change the battery. I mostly recharge the battery while in the camera to avoid having to reset the date. I like the remote and the app works ok. It's not a GoPro, but you get what you pay for and what you get is a pretty good camera at an affordable price.",4,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0

I recommend reading and researching as much as possible regarding this camera.Setting up and starting to shoot was easy & it is exactly as presented, a less expensive alternative to GoPro that delivers excellent quality photos and video. It is easy to use, almost intuitive, versatile and useful. It comes with a nice accessory package with which to get started. I recommend a fast Class 10 SD card (not included) like the ScanDisk Extreme PLUS, or PRO, or the Samsung PRO or PRO+. I use the Samsung, I tried a a slower 32MB card and wasn't happy with the results.

"I bought this camera in order to record my practices. So far after the first try, the battery lasted the whole practice which was a little under 1.25 hrs. The files saved, get broken up into 10 minute clips, but here was about 2 seconds of missed recording every time it created a new clip. So if I was performing my program that was running past a 10 minute mark, the next clip picks up 2 seconds later. Even though it might not sound like a big deal, it is a bit annoying to not see that 2 seconds. I'll have to make use of the remote or phone app to intentionally break up the clips so that they won't hit 10 minutes, but wish I didn't have to worry about it when focusing on other things at the moment. The remote isnt always successful with every button press so its difficult to know if youre starting or stopping a record.It's also not the best in lower lighting settings which would result in alot of noise in the picture. For the price compared to a gopro, it does the job that I need.",3,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0

This is the first action camera I've ever owned so really cant do a caparison to a go pro or other cameras, but what I can say is that I took it to the beach and tested it out and the videos it produced look just as good as videos shot with a GoPro. Be sure to get an SD Card that can handle the high resolutions and frame speed. I chose a Samsung Pro Plus 64GB SD card and it unlocks all the camera's potential and works great!

At the price I assumed it would be like the cheap $30 ones you find at local retailers that overstate their quality.Quite excited to say the quality of the camera, also the fact that we get two batteries.

"I just received the camera, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it.  My only complaint is with Amazon, not Akaso.  Amazon bundles a 64GB microSD card under the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section, so I bought one with the camera.  When they arrived,  I read the owners manual for the camera, it stated that it supports up to 32GB.  I'll have to test this to see if this is true or not.  Maybe newer firmware allows 64GB, but I'll test to find out.  Or maybe their manual is just out of date.  The app on my phone works well.  So far, I'm very pleased with the purchase.  For the money, it's a great deal.  The video quality is not as good as a $400 GoPro, but it's really close.  A steal if you ask me.",5,1,2017-1-12,1,1,0
"We're very happy with the EK7000.  We primarily purchased this for use as a webcam hooked to our desktop PC but our kids have also used it to make video recordings for their virtual homework assignments.  The product comes with a ton of accessories, mounts, batteries, etc...unlike more expensive brands (this is awesome!).  It records clear video, we mostly record in 1080p 60fps.  The only shortcoming I've seen is there isn't any image stabilization.  So if you don't use a gimbal, a tripod/mount or hold it very still then the video will be somewhat shaky.  This hasn't been a problem for our use case, we typically have it mounted on a desk or on a small tripod for stable recording.  Overall this is a solid product, great value and we would purchase it again.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

I just love these lil cameras.  I purchased two versions.  They both are excellent and offer different capabilities.  I mounted the Wifi version on my front bumper guard of my jeep to see off road trails in real time :).  To be able to see that cam in real time without wires or true wifi on my phone is just #$%# awesome.  10 Stars,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I've been playing with it all day and very happy with the pictures. I'm mounting this on my kayak for vacation. My son wouldn't let me play with his GP, so I found this one. So far I'm very happy with the camera and even put it in the goldfish pond! Looking forward to capturing all the crazy things I see while paddling around lakes, seaways and the Bay. Also will be trying it while hiking and Labrador swimming.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
Wow! super impressed with quality of video I have an outdated camera Sony Handycam and needed to acquire smaller camera for general purpose. This camera will do it for me. easy to operate without looking at the manual. I like the fact that you have the option to remove date stamp and the application to view pictures and operate camera from my Cell phone. Nice camera and NICE price.,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
I purchased this  Camera for and upcoming vacation from Amazon prime and appreciated how quickly it arrived. I was so excited I  Opened it that day and had the manual downloaded with a simple scan of a code that was in the Box. I reviewed the instructions and was instantly able to start experimenting with photos and videos once I had installed my  Mini SD card purchased separately. I was amazed how easy it was to use and even had it connected to my cell phone within 30 minutes and was taking experimental video and uploading it to my phone and deleting it again at will.  I also love that it came with a small remote to start video and snap pictures and a whole bunch of other mounting options in the package for no extra charge.,5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
I spent a lot of time searching through reviews for a good outdoor sports camera that wouldn't break the bank and still be really good quality. This is it. We have zero complaints and are pleasantly surprised at the high quality pictures and videos. It also come with a very good bundle. The 2 batteries with charger and waterproof cover were the most that impressed us. You get a lot for the price and that makes it perfect.,5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I have been riding motorcycles for years and wanted to start videoing my rides.  Looked at a lot of products before I bought the Akaso Action camera EK7000.  I was watching a YouTube on motorcycling videoing and the rider recommended this camera based on the quality, mounting flexibility, and price.  My EK7000 arrived yesterday.  Instructions included were minimal, but provided a QR code for on on-line manual that was helpful.  Setup was easy.  having 2 batteries is going to be great, providing 180 minutes of record time.  I did some testing of the quality and ability to get video off EK7000.  So far so good.  Easy with the app that is provided for Apple and Android.  Just downlad from the respective stores.  I am going to mount to my motorcycle today and test out!  What I have seen so far makes this a great purchase for me.  I am looking for some great memories to be recorded.",5,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0
"This camera is great, especially for the price.  The battery life, picture quality, button responsiveness, and size are more than satisfactory.  I'm new to these types of cameras, but since this is my first purchase, it was definitely worth it.  It came with a whole lot of useful accessories, some of which I haven't used yet.My only complaint is this: There is no way to actually implement one of the included clip accessories that I want to use.  The clip has a wide male-end piece with no female end to context to.",4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0

It met our expectations and then some!  Perfect size, waterproof, and lots of extra accessories.  We took it to the beach today and my son had a BLAST with it!!!  Highly recommend! We are very satisfied and it was delivered quickly! Thanks from a Mom with a very happy son!Oh, and get the SD card - I didn’t realize we needed one so make sure to order one.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"I purchased this item for my trip to Kauai. I took lots of videos while snorkeling. Videos and images came out surprisingly great for an inexpensive camera. Very pleased with the results. Did not have any issues with water leaking. Once I was hit by a big wave, and the case dislodged. Some water got in, but the camera was operational after that. The only improvement I may suggest is do not reset date when the battery is replaced. The counter starts over. This can be annoying, other than that, great product.",5,1,2019-11-19,1,0,1
"I like the ease of the camera, waterproof case etc.. what I don't like is that it comes with a hundred little other pieces with no paperwork included to tell you what in the world they are for!

Very good video quality for the price. It’s very easy to use.I was not able to use the helmet mounts as I had hoped.

You can use one and the other you can have readily available to switch out and so that you don't run out of batteries.  Looking to use it some more.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"I spent quite some time shopping around for a sports camera with reasonable budget. I need some light weighted camera that can record video / photos when I do bicycling, skiing or snorkeling. The EK7000 satisfies all my requirement, it's built with very good quality, provides all necessary features (waterproof, 4K high resolution video, wide angle etc.) and lots of useful accessories. Right after I received the camera, I just charged the battery and mounted the camera on my bicycle then bounced out to play. This camera works perfectly, the video recorded is in very good quality (I set 1080 60Hz resolution), sound is clear, and it's quite stable too. I recommend this camera if you just want to shoot regular video during your recreation.",5,1,2018-12-4,1,0,0
"Nice little camera with great picture quality for the price. Takes excellent pictures and quality 4k video.You need to have a 4K compatible device to play back.

"This is my daughter's first camera and she likes that it came with a bunch of stuff like two batteries, extra mounts and a waterproof case.  One thing I noticed is that the user interface is a bit clunky.  You have to use the camera a lot to remember what the different arrow keys do.  It could be a little bigger so the screen was bigger and maybe there could be room for more buttons.  Overall, for $50, it's a pretty darn good camera; however, if you are a professional you probably want to look elsewhere.",4,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
This is the best action camera you can buy dollar by dollar. Not considered necessary spending $20 or $30 more for the newer model since the previous was enough. Easy to use and excellent video quality. The WiFi feature is a top! This is my first camera so I don’t have criteria to compare but I noticed that on the first use the battery lasted less than 1.5 hrs. Don’t know if this is normal. Soon I will use it for scuba diving and will update review.,5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Completely disappointed with this product. 6 month after purchasing I’ve found nothing but problems with this camera. The battery cap falls off, the still picture quality is below average, the video and audio quality is subpar and there is absolutely no driver support downloads for PC use. If I could send it back I would. Save your money on this item.",1,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"The camera is great for what it is supposed to do. Where it is lacking is around the app to the camera, which kills the camera battery wise connecting by acting like a access point. The directions are limited at best and non-technical people are going to have an issue with the lack of information. All the different mounts need better explanation. I had to go and hit the website and read up on the product. This is a great alternative to G0PRO but I worry about the poor Operating system it uses.",4,1,2017-12-27,1,1,0
"AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle is the best camera I have ever owned!

"This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned.",2,1,2017-12-17,1,1,0
I was skeptical of purchasing this camera due to the price. You know... You get what you pay for. After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and order one.

"The 2 issues would be (1) camera quality and (2) battery life. The better quality you run the camera at the faster it will die. However they include a back up batter so if you have it record about 480p, the 2 batteries together last 4-5 hours. They also include many accessories to hook-up your camera to your bike's handle bars, helmet, etc. They also provide an app to control the camera from your phone. The interface on the camera is also quite easy to use as well.Summary - For how cheap the camera is compared to others, you get what you expect, however the accessories that come with the camera definitely make it worth the buy.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
Loved this item! Used it in Aruba for a family vacation to capture on video all of our fun. Was great in the water and on land. Just need to remember to charge the battery when low so it will be ready for the next day. Also purchased the stick to make it easier to use as it is very small—convenient for carrying. Would recommend it for anyone who is looking for something a bit less expensive than some of the other more popular brand names and does not want to sacrifice quality. Isn’t that everyone?,5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
I bought this camera primarily for its cheap price and popularity on this website. This is my first action camera so I do not have the chance to compare it with other cameras.

"I’ve been using this camera as a dash cam mounted to my windshield. This obviously doesn’t require perfect video quality and so it’s good for that. For the money it’s worth it for the most part. There is definitely room for improving on stabilization, ease of use and of the app. The app crashes quite often and so that’s frustrating as it doesn’t have to do a whole lot. I got a letter saying that if I wrote a review for the camera(which I did buy on my own), I’d get a free pair of shoes and a hat. We’ll see how that goes.",4,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0
"Extremely impressed with this camera.  The quality of it is just as good as it's competitor and comes with quite a few accessories.Seriously, it's a pile of different mounts and extra battery.  Love that they added all the extras that the other guys make you buy.",5,1,2017-3-8,1,1,0
"After a few initial uses, I think this is a terrific product at an unbelievable cheap price.  For the average family use, it will serve our needs just fine.  In addition to the camera taking very clear videos and pictures, the accessories that are part of the basic package are outstanding, including a second battery.  I am really glad I did not purchase any other brand as this offers a fantastic bang for the buck.  I will be ordering additional ones for the family in the upcoming year.",5,1,2017-1-6,1,2,0
I used this camera to video backcountry mountain snowmobiling for my website and YouTube channel as a way to get more riders in the group to capture footage without breaking the bank. I can’t say enough about the durability and video quality of this camera. The battery lasted about an hour and a half in the snow which is pretty good. It comes with 2 so swapped them out and kept going. Unfortunately a mount I had bought attach to the handle bars broke when we had a sled get stuck and rolled out. And the camera got buried in the snow and we lost it....,4,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
I really like the camera because of its size and quality of pictures and videos. I think the price is totally worth it! I plan on using this camera when I go to Ecuador. I am really excited to use it underwater and when I do activities like ziplining. I love the fact that the camera is small because I don't really have to worry about someone stealing it from me when I walk around the city and it won't take that much space in my purse. It's a very convenient camera that produces good quality pictures and pictures.,5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

"I wanted to try a cam like this but not spend a lot of money for it since I wont be using it all the time. This really fit the bill. The picture quality in video and still format is excellent. I put it underwater to test that aspect and it was  good also.It comes with several styles of mounts, one of which I wasnt sure how to use. I got with the supplier and figured it out.

"I ran a long 12 hour time lapse with this camera and it worked flawlessly - I kept the camera hooked up to power for the time lapse since clearly, the battery wouldn't last that long. I used the included bicycle mount to attach the camera to a pole, and it worked great at giving me a cool look at the fish in my pond.I have no complaints - great accessories included and everything feels well built. The operations of the camera are very intuitive and simple to navigate. I will be recommending this camera to my friends.",5,1,2018-9-4,1,0,1
"Arrived fast and exactly as described. This is a much better camera than a GoPro! I have had a GoPro, and it worked for about 6 months before initial battery failure.

If they are good enough to use on and filming  Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Audi R8s and Bmw i8s, going very fast then they are probably good enough for you. Can't beat the price or the quality. Buy one.",5,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0

"This is an excellent product, especially for the price. I posted pictures with my review that were all taken with the EK7000 Action Camera. The only reason why I gave a medium review on stabilization is because you do have to be still to get a clear picture. The good pictures that I have are ones of me floating above the surface. Action shots, while moving, did not turn out. I do have the one picture of me swimming next to a full grown sea turtle, though. All of these pictures were taken while snorkeling Molokini Crater off the Hawaii Island of Maui.Note: don't forget to order a micro SD card.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,1

"Great value! We bought this for our Florida vacation and went snorkeling, swimming, boating, etc. The waterproof case is 100% effective, although audio is muffled through the case. It takes great pictures but not new smartphone quality (but it's not $900, like a new smartphone would be). We would only take a few minutes of video at a time and pictures here and there and the battery was EXCELLENT. Over about 4 days, I think I only changed it once. The only thing I didn't like is the date/time would reset everytime I turned it on and I got tired of changing it so a bunch of our pics have the wrong date on them. But there's probably a setting I could change somewhere. Would 100% but again!",5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,1

I just know he is going to love using this, especially when he attaches it to the handlebars of his little motorcycle or to the headband attachment we also purchased.

In each situation, the recording would stop on its own, the screen would freeze, or it would just shut off. Sometimes I had to pull the battery to restart it other times I could just turn the power back on. Sometimes it would keep the video, other times it wouldn't.

I would recommend this to anyone based on quality, appearance, and use. Our first one did end up with a faulty button on the side, it just depressed one day and wouldn't function anymore.

"The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera.",3,1,2018-6-6,1,1,0
"Honestly, if this were compared to a gopro at a gopro price point, it would be more of a 3 star product.. However for the price this little guy isnt too bad. Not perfect for the price, but definitely seen worse around this price.Have not tried it near water yet, or even outside in hot cold or dry or even dusty places.. just use it on a camera stand to record videos of me using my LED light up gloves to music.",4,1,2019-2-12,1,0,0

"This camera takes really good quality pictures, and the accessories that come with it are a nice touch, especially the waterproof housing.Easy set up, the smartphone app has not worked, but I'm still trying. - Just finished a week diving trip and this little camera packed a huge punch underwater. Did not work past 100ft and you must buy a red filter for the lense, but other than that it worked really well and took some awesome pictures. See some of my pics.",5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,1
"For $50 you will be SUPER happy. Pay attention when setting up the app. There’s one step that you’ll over look and think it’s not working. Used mine under water in Hawaii, Mexico, and Bahamas now with no issues.  Don’t let the GoPro commercials fool you, shooting underwater isn’t gonna look like it does in their ads. The clarity I saw in the water is what I saw on the camera. Location, depth, sunlight penetration, and water clarity do matter.",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"This is a great camera for the money, does the job well. Waterproof case works like a charm.As for video and pictures quality, it was supprisingly good & can be adjusted in the settings, and the default works just fine if all you're doing is a simple biking or kayaking video. Another bonus was it excepted a 128Gb SD card for all day video. So if you don't want to spend over of 200 or more dollars on an expensive GoPro, this product is a perfect alternative.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"Updated** After posting the review below, their customer support contacted me immediately and sent me out two new batteries with a  charger. It allowed me to use my camera again and capture wonderful pictures of our adventures in Colorado. I'll be using this camera to capture many more adventures and commend their customer support.Old review* Here's the thing, when it worked, I really liked it. The problem is, I only had it for 6 months and then could no longer use it due to a charging error that said it had been recalled for overheating. I used it three times before I had to stop. This was after I got shipped the wrong thing in the first place. I'm saving up for a GoPro.",4,1,2018-6-28,1,0,0
"This product was a budget purchase into the world of action cameras, and I was not disappointed with this purchase! What you get is a great camera with clear, crisp images and video with nearly all the same features of a GoPro. My only qualm with this product is that the microphone is lacking (which isn't a huge deal for me, but could be for some) and that there are no third-party accessories to remedy it. The only way to resolve the microphone is to physically modify the camera to wire a 3.5mm jack in parallel to the existing mic. Not a job for beginners, but with the cost of this device it's certainly worth trying (two wires being soldered on with slight drilling to make the jack accessible).Overall this is definitely a great entry point for action cameras, and worth ""getting your feet wet"" with.",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"You cannot beat this camera for the price.  Purchased this for my eleven year old daughter so that she can make videos of all the neighboorhood kids doing what kids do.  It has successfully survived a year of hard use so far and is still going strong.  It comes with many accessories (the clear plastic case was the first casualty, but I believe that to be user error).  The image quality is on par with the big name brand unit, but for a fraction of the cost.  LCD screen on rear and bluetooth connections to your phone or tablet make use a snap.",5,1,2018-2-10,1,0,0
"This was my first time using an action camera so I was nervous making the purchase online when I knew so little. I’ve got to say, so far so good! Even though it didn’t come with a user manual (and the link to a manual they gave came up as a 404 cannot be found page) I was able to quickly figure it all out and we took her out for a snorkeling trip! It would be cool if the remote was waterproof but it’s still a great tool! It was awesome getting to use the app to see the pictures I just taken! The picture included isn’t *super* clear, but only because that was the water conditions. Recommending to all my friends that are inquiring!",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,1
"This my first ever action camera, I looked long and hard at the Go-Pro options, I didn't want to spend $300+ on something I wasn't sure I would even like. This was a great alternative, less money for basically the same thing, plus it included items like 2 batteries, mounting options, etc... that would have made the other guys even higher. My first impression is it is small than I thought (good thing), simple to operate, easy to understand, video quantity and lens view seem very nice.  The only drawback I have found so far, is that when the camera is in the waterproof case (were it will be most of the time for me) the buttons are harder to push and you have to listen to the sound to verify that you pushed hard enough. It does come with a remote, so after the initial setup it will be easy to manage in the fieldPlan to use for fishing/kayaking",4,1,2018-5-6,1,0,0
"I like the idea of a inexpensive action camers.  This camera is okay but I am very disapointed with the battery life.  Ninty (90) minitutes is far from the max of 20-25 min I get from this camera.  If someone is getting 90 min, please tell me how?  I wish I could return the camera.  I did not use it much due to workload and no time to get outdoors.  Things have changed now so I now have time and used the carmera yesterday.  I got a disapointing 20 min battery life so between the two batteries you almost get one (1) hour.  Vidoe and soum]n quality are good but this battery thing just ticks me off.",3,1,2018-2-24,1,0,0
"Great boxing along with many accessories. Camera is similar to other higher end models. 1080p is best setting at 60 fps. 4k is awful, useless and choppy as hell. No sound with waterproof case on. Setup screen is easy to use with app. Comes with 2 batteries and charger. Full screen in back. Using WiFi tends to make unit warm. Overall, not bad for the money.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
I would not suggest buying this. I thought it would be a good cheaper version of a Nother brand that’s popular for active cameras. But this is terrible quality and all the instructions are in Chinese the app is in Chinese so you don’t even know how to set it up. The packaging was cracked when I ordered it and I would not suggest buying it if you were looking for an alternative to other active cameras.,1,1,2018-2-19,1,1,0
"i purchased this for snorkeling. i looked at the pictures on amazon and reviews and was confident about this purchase. however, i the picture quality didnt turn out to be great for me. the pictures and videos under water were not clear and some were even grainy. the videos underwater were not clear either. i ended up returning this purchase. another thing to note is the battery life isnt the greatest. they do provide two batteries though.",3,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
"Great little camera for a 9 year old when you don't want to spend the big bucks on the more popular brand.  We did have to download a different camera app but I love how you can either use the remote or your device to control the camera.  I am supposed to receive a few extra items after writing a review or something like that but I wasn't writing a review until after the camera had been put through the wringer by the 9 year old, regardless of onus items.  Other than a scratch on the waterproof case (caused by my son) this camera is holding up well with selfies, photos, & action and underwater videos.  Good deal!",5,1,2016-12-29,1,1,0
"We bought this camera to take on a cruise that went to Mexico. We used the camera on the cruise, in the pool, in the ocean when we arrived and we even mounted in to a helmet when we embarked on an ATV ride through the jungle. Overall the device performed great and did everything it said it would in the description. I would recommend purchasing the A bundle full of different mounts for added fun. We have used the chest mount on our dog when throwing the ball and taking him on hikes for a fun POV. Great product!",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Honestly, I was surprised to see that this had 4K Video for something this cheap. I figured I would take the plunge and see how this REALLY looks.And honestly? It's not bad at all. It's QUITE GOOD.

***Updated***Do not trust the mounts for highway speed wind sheer. Lost my first camera. The company replaced the camera so kudos to them for being supportive of their customers.

"I bought this camera for my 6 year old and i have admit that i use it more than he does. The video quality is great, underwater use is good with the volume being slightly muffled by the waterproof casing, but this is normal. Its easy to use and setup is no problem. This thing cost a fraction of the price and works just as good as the brand name competitors. I would definitely reccomend!",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I bought this action camera with little expectations.  Just wanted something to supplement my photo shoots mounted on top of my DSLR.  A zoom function would have been nice but or the price, it does the job.  Image quality and video quality is good enough to capture what I need.  This is a good price point for the product.  Don't expect a GoPro and accept this product for what it is and you will not be disappointed.",4,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"I mounted this camera to my motorcycle helmet (at the chin). It's perfect for the price and provides a great way for me to look back at some close calls. It's not amazing at reading license plates from a distance since the looping video option doesn't work for 4k video, but it would be perfect for showing a police officer or insurance company who is at fault in an accident. The only other problem I run into is the Date & Time settings reset every time the battery dies.",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Excellent stabilization and perfect for people searching for something similar in quality to the official GoPro.

"My son has been nagging to get a go pro. I didn't want to spend those big bucks on the name. Plus he's 15 and who knows how long it would hold his attention. So I settled for the Akaso EK7000. Let me tell you I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality. I actually bought another one for my husband. It takes great video while fishing, dirt biking, hiking and the list goes on and on. Excellent quality of picture. Video is steady and not shaky like cheaper models. If you are just getting into the world of go pros I would highly suggest starting with this model. You will not be disappointed. I did purchase separately a chest and head mount. It makes taking video a little easier.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0

I am a nature photography and this camera has opened up a new world to supplement my still work.  Placing this camera on an extender pole can gain access to new worlds that have been traditionally difficult to achieve with my conventional gear.

"The day before Christmas Eve I was looking for one additional gift for my son.  I went to Best Buy and was looking at the GoPro cameras but wasn’t willing to spend over $250 for the basic camera.  Was looking through Amazon and came across this camera!!!! BEST DEAL EVER!!!! My son is 10 and wanted to start a YouTube channel.  This camera does it all for him.  It links right to his iPhone, has the adapter pieces that allow him to do his stunts and keep the camera safe.  The picture quality is great and I have a happy kid.  He hasn’t stopped making videos since he took it out of the box and set up the camera, which was super easy btw.  We haven’t tried it in water yet but he’s already planning what he is going to do when the pool opens in the spring.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
I purchased two of these to try some different angles for my soccer team and to do some side projects at school. Have been using for a couple weeks now and have not had any major issues.  Picture quality is fine. Sound is decent if not in the waterproof case. I will probably upgrade to a higher model at some point for better image stabilization and maybe some zoom if available(no zoom on this one).  If you are looking for something for tripod use this works great. Most of the attachments that come with it are for helmet and bike handle use.  I'm sure they would work fine if thats what you are going to use it for.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Glad I didn't go all out for the GoPro, this little machine is great!  I've strapped it to my bicycle helmet and hit the trails, the picture quality was great!  It was a little bouncy but that is only because I didn't have the strap tight enough, once I fixed that no worries!  The sound quality isn't that great but I wasn't too concerned about capturing sound so that is not a big deal to me.  I am very happy with this product, price and quality!",5,1,2018-12-4,1,0,0

It did not have image stabilization but in reviewing my videos, it turned out not to be a problem at all.  I highly recommend this camera if you wand good quality video but don't want to risk the investment in a more expensive camera.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
What a super little camera at a fantastic price.  I think it performs as well as a GOPRO at a fraction of the price!

Came with two batteries and a wrist remote which is perfect for on the go action.  At the time of purchase, an option to get some additional attachments for 30% was a bonus.  Still need to test the WiFi app but I will expect that to work well.  If you are looking to record in 1080p, the EK7000 will get the job done.Thank you Akaso!",5,1,2017-12-31,1,1,0
"This camera is amazing, I use it for my youtube channel and it's clear, charges quickly and I also bought an extender to be able to take videos from different heights and angles, it fits perfectly and doesn't affect the quality at all. I have yet to try it underwater but from what I've seen of other people's videos it's quality and clarity are incredible.

"I would definitely buy again and recommend it - you cannot beat the quality for the price!!  This is an excellent camera and I would say it deserves 4 1/2 stars only because it doesn't come with the underwater filter or separate charger.  It comes with 2 batteries but you have to charge the battery in the camera unless you buy the separate charger.  But given how good this little camera performs that is a very minor thing.  We bought it just before we left on vacation and didn't have time to really check it out before going.  I was not disappointed in both pictures and video.  The kids had a blast filming while they jumped off a cliff into the water and filming things underwater.  The little camera provided great quality video with sound and the ""high impacts"" from the jumps didn't bother this little camera at all - sturdy.  We used it snorkeling and scuba diving - to about 40' depth.  We purchased the 64GB chip with it and I was glad I did.  The kids were constantly filming videos but we never ran out of memory.  The controls are a bit tricky at first.  At night I'd download the pics/videos to our laptop for viewing.  In the water, out of the water, people pics, landscape shots...they were all very high quality and gave us some great pics/vids to remember our vacation.  The set also comes with a bunch of various connectors to attach to things.  We mainly used the waterproof compartment with a handle (purchased as a separate item).  Great product...highly recommend.",5,1,2017-4-16,1,1,0
"First and foremost: The reason this product has so many reviews is because the company ships a free gift to those who write a review and send them a screenshot. However, the instructions *don't* state what rating to give. As such, it appears to be a genuine effort to have customers write reviews.In terms of actual quality, I wanted a very cheap underwater camera for a trip to Hawaii, and this met the desired criteria. The video quality is actually pretty good (not 4k quality, but certainly HD). The camera also comes with a wide range of accessories. The value for the dollar is great.",3,1,2017-1-31,1,1,0
"It came with everything except a memory card. But I have a spare one, so it was ok. The camera is pretty well built and all the attachments you need were included.

I needed to simply slide off  but I had to find out the way through searching youtube video.",5,1,2019-1-13,1,0,0
"The Akaso EK7000 camera is a very good and inexpensive alternative to the GoPros. I use mine in the car (as a dashcam) and on the mountain bike. The video quality is great…I’m only shooting in 1080p 60 and 1080p 30. When mounted on the bike, the camera responds very well to shakes, bumps, wheelies, etc. Nice surprise is how good the quality is even when driving/riding towards the sun. The picture quality can be improved but I’m not losing any sleep over that because all I care is the videos. The camera came with bunch of usable accessories and a remote control. The last is perfect to snap pics but it needs a bit of a push-and-hold to start a video. Also, the battery indicator is not to be trusted to the dot. As a safe rule of thumb, I always deduct 25% of the shown battery level to get a real sense of how much juice is left to shoot with. All-in-all I’m very happy with this little camera. It does what I needed to do and it’s a great bargain for one’s buck.Pros: quality of videos, accessories, stabilizer, it takes 64GB SD card",5,1,2018-1-14,1,1,0

So far I like it a lot. It produces really clear video, and can be remotely operated by app or remote control.

I bought this camera to film videos while riding my 4 wheeler and it has just been fantastic. The waterproof case keeps the camera dry even when going through the deepest holes,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"Used the camera going to Wisconsin and took some video of my grandchildren swimming in the pool.The camera stayed waterproof and has a clear video capture under water. Works good on not so lighted areas with no noise.Color wise is great but not too much in audio.Anyways the unit is good for family use in capturing videos/photos.Still good in price.And by the way you could connect the unit via Wifi,",5,1,2019-4-15,1,0,0
"First, the plastic base the camera is mounted to in the display box is flimsy and breaks.  My camera arrived having broken off of the mount and bouncing around in the clear plastic box on the top of the package.  That looks nice in a store, but is a problem for shipping.  The camera still functioned, which I would expect for an 'action' camera, but it seems a more secure way of shipping is called for.The real problem is a dirty sensor right out of the box, as can be seen on the attached picture.  This is on the sensor, not the lens, and there is no way to clean it.",1,1,2017-12-25,1,1,1
"I got this camera on sale and very glad I did. I did not know much about action cameras when I purchased this one. I figured with all accessories and price it was a good deal ($40 at the time). Well, I put this thing through it's paces on a biking trip in the mountains and the footage came out great! Was able to share with my family now once I was able to get a decent video editing program to compress the files to share and send to my family all around the country that were on the trip. Which was nice to relive going down the trail in the wide angle format, we put it on the big screen and instantly took us back.If you want a spare action camera or this is your first pull the trigger.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I bought this to use as a camera for pictures only while paddleboarding.  I knew it was fish eyed and made to be more for videos.  I takes ok pictures at best.  Side by side with a Samsung S8 or iPhone 7, the picture quality is rough.  It's waterproof and small, but turning it on and off resets it back to video mode.  It won't stay on the mode you leave it.  The battery is also terrible.  Even just using it as a camera, I get about an hour and a half.  I kinda knew what I was getting into, and I knew it wasn't a gopro, but I don't know if if but it again.",2,1,2017-11-1,1,0,0
"Took it to Cancun, worked like a charm. Would highly recommend, especially due to the cost compared to gopro. Easy to use, and picture quality is great. Took it scuba diving and held up without any issues.  All photos and video can be easily accessed through the app. Photos can be reviewed on the screen, but videos have to be viewed on the app or your computer.Worth the buy if you are wanting to take pictures/video under water.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"Tested the case in shallow water, including repeatedly pressing all the buttons, and it did not leak a drop. Have not tested at any depth.The camera itself feels cheaply made, especially the door to the battery compartment.",3,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"I used this camera on my Christmas Cruise I took last year & it did worked well. The quality is decent. It may not be a pro go but I would say it’s very very close to it. It’s worth the price. I’m so grateful that I bought this cam because little did I know, both my Fiancé & I cell phones shut all the way down on us. We couldn’t even unlock our phones to get to our home screen so we couldn’t take pics. Our cousin took pics for us with her phone so this cam came in handy.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"Update!  Seller was very accommodating, and made this 100% right with me.  I am going to be giving this product another try, and also would absolutely buy from seller again!  Original Review: I bought this for a week trip of snorkeling in Cozumel.  Although it took great videos and pictures, it only lasted for the 1st 2 days of the trip, so I had 5 days that I couldn't get any footage of.  I never used it out of the waterproof case. Never dove deeper than a few feet, and never dropped the unit.  It just simply stopped working!  The only time I could get it to work was when I pulled out the battery, and put battery back in, and it would power up for 2 seconds, and then shut down.  It is a shame, because I was really happy with how it worked, the 2 batteries that came with it, the watch band remote control was really cool, and I loved that it came with a TON of accessories.  I really wanted this to work out!",5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
"Being new to video recording there was a  bit of a learning curve to this device. Not so much in the point & shoot aspect of it, but with how to use it most effectively. Comes in box with a ton of attachments so it can be creatively attached to just about everything.My only issue is that it will occasionally time out when transfering files from the camera to my Samsung Galaxy 5e tablet. Could be the tablet, could be the software, could be the camera, could be the memory card. I dunno.",4,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"My niece is a YouTuber and wanted a waterproof camera to blog her family trip to the beach.  She's only 9 so I didn't want to spend a ton of money.  I must say we are totally impressed! Unbelievable video, and the waterproof case was incredible for underwater snorkeling shots.  My niece was so excited and happy with this little action camera with every attachment imaginable.",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"This is a decent little camera. The one major flaw is the lack of image stabilization. The static wide angle is a touch annoying but workable, but the lack of image stabilization makes the video dizzying unless set down on something. The good news is for $10 more there is basically the same camera with some improvements including EIS. I am ultimately going to return this one and order the one with EIS. Other than that, the number of additional accessories, the fact that it came with 2 batteries, and all the various clamps and attachments was awesome. Only thing it didn't come with was a memory card but I had an extra 64GB anyway so no biggie. Over all it's a cool little camera at a way better price than the go pros.",4,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
This camera is great! My 10 year old loves his so much we bought one for our 7 year old too. It takes amazing underwater pictures and videos. They can’t wait to get the accessory kit so they can record themselves on their bikes and on the trampoline. Definitely get you money’s worth with this product.,5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"Bought for son , he likes it alot. It's actually a really good quality camera forbits size , and price.  I like that you are able to buy a ton of accessories for it !! I gave the water resistance score a 3 stars..because we have not tried in water yet.  Only dislike is i wish it came with a manual !! Kinda hard to figure stuff out on your own with it.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I must say that I really like this action camera.  I've only used it 2-3 times at this point, but it worked great and the picture and video quality are perfect. I took this snorkeling and diving with sharks 4 miles off the shore of Hawaii. Diving with sharks is kind of a once in a lifetime  event, so the video was important to me and it did not disappoint. Seriously, you can go and spend $200-$400 more on a big brand name, but this camera does the exact same thing, so why.  Also, the amount of accessories that this comes with are fantastic and would cost a bit more for a big brand name camera too.  I can't wait to take it on hikes and more adventures as well. Do not overthink this purchase...Go buy it now, you won't regret it.",5,1,2018-9-13,1,0,0
"I got this camera as a Christmas present and in the few days of using it I these things stand out. One pro is the camera tells you how much film time and photo space you have left. But there was one con, I noticed that the camera wouldn't record in 4K because the included micro SD card was only 4GB. A larger capacity SD card is required. Overall I definitely recommend this action camera for it's great price point",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"I am very surprised of the quality of the product. I did not expect the camera to be so good and capable of making videos with such incredible quality and resolution. So I was surprised that for such an affordable price the camera worked so well. I have made videos with my camera AKASO in the sea, in the pool, in the bicycle, like dashcam among others. I love the way that you can use your camera with the App and download pics and videos to  your phone. I am very happy with my new camera and I know that you will not be disappointed if you buy one. Overall a very good buy.",5,1,2017-1-2,1,1,0
I love this camera and am amazed by the quality of it for the low price. I had my doubts but after setting it up and using it I am convinced that it was well worth the money paid. I surf alot and my board has a built-in camera mount and this camera fits perfectly. All the accessories that came with this camera just blew my mind and I don't need anything else to have great videos and pictures come home with me from the ocean. NICE JOB AKASO!,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"It is a great camera for the money. It records in 720P, 1080P, and 4K. It comes with two batteries. I used 64GB Samsung EVO Micro SD, and it records well. I haven’t tested its waterproof ability yet. It comes with a handlebar mount and a helmet mount, but not a head mount.",4,1,2019-6-18,1,1,0
"I purchased this for a snorkeling vacation, and to see if I like the concept of using it underwater.It is fantastic value for the price.  Looking at a large number of web reviews, one can see that the opposition might slightly outperform it slightly in some areas, but at several times the price.  So the price/value combination is unbeatable.  As a camera. it does everything it should and comes with a range of accessories, including a spare battery and battery charger. It provides a result that should be sufficient for nearly everyone who is not a professional photographer",4,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0
The description states that a micro SD card is highly recommended and it is not included. This was purchased for a birthday and was THE GIFT the recipient has been asking for It!  The mocro SD card is required to record video!  Very disappointed!  Seller needs to change the description.  Micro SD card is required for it to work!,1,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I liked the camera but the buttons are only okay; they can be confusing without graphics near or on them.  We bought for a cruise (underwater picture attached) and it fit the bill.  No concerns about water leakage.  Many attachments included but no wrist strap (or the possible Velcro piece isn't comfortable if it is meant to be a strap.) Upon powering up, the video option is default. I think that if the photo screen was first it might be a bit easier, or default to last used photo/video option.Transferring photos to desktop is fairly straightforward.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"The Akaso camera is an amazing product at a great price! I got it only 2 days prior to a trip, so didn't have much time to get used to it. We put it on a chest harness and got awesome video and pics while zip-lining, then immediately  (uh-oh) went to hit the rapids on kayaks...we added the water-proof case and went to the head-mount and yup, you guessed it...we should have added floatation :( The camera is somewhere on the bottom of the Lower Mountain Fork River maybe near some large boulders and a low-hanging branch lol! I have placed an order for a replacement camera and you can bet we'll download pics between excursions...my girl-friend says there's a good possibility that she'll wear it from now on...",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
This camera takes the best video. I cannot believe how good the video and pictures turn out.The first one I bought malfunctioned and was refunded by Amazon without any problems.You can download the App. to connect with your cellphone and operate it remotely. It also has a wrist mouted remote to take video and pictures remotely. It is the most fun camera I have ever owned and the possibilities for it are endless.I bought the Luxbell accessories for this and they work very well.,5,1,2017-6-1,1,1,0
"We used this camera on a cruise last week. While we were using it in the water, the case came open and of course water got into the camera. We were able to salvage the SD card and the picture quality was amazing. I am returning it only because the action case that was suppose to protect the camera failed.UPDATE - Rebecca with customer service reached out and was extremely helpful and wanted to make sure I was satisfied with their product. As mentioned cameras pictures were fantastic so I was willing to give it another try - just extremely cautious if used in water. I’m happy to give them another chance. Great customer service given when not asked for!",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"Was really impressed with this camera. I got it for trips, golf course, and snowboarding. It’s done wonders for me so far. Thought the picture and color balance was better the GoPro. As far as scrolling through the camera I thought it was pretty straight toward and easy. I did get both the apps to work but the downfall is you have to have WiFi for those to work and where I’ll be using this 90% of the time I won’t have WiFi. Or at least I couldn’t get it to BT for when I didn’t have WiFi. Really awesome that all the accessories came with it. This camera for the price is absolutely worth every penny and I highly recommend it.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"Tl;dr good buy for the price tag, waterproof case works well, and battery lasts about 1.5hr.Overall the camera is as listed. Good build quality for a low price tag. It comes with a ton of accessories as well. The plastic though feels a bit like a toy but it holds up well. The image quality is good in day light, but it’s a little saturated in dim or dark lighting. I put the camera in the waterproof case it comes with to test it and put it in a bucket of water for 10mins and there was not a drop of water inside the case at all and the camera was safe. The set up for the camera was easy as well, and the battery lasts for about 1.5hr ish so it’s nice if you go for a hike or bike ride or something for a bit.",4,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"This camera had everything I needed to attach to my bird feeding gizmo.  It was perfect for my needs.  The wifi worked well and I was able to connect to my phone readily.  The parts all interchange well with the action cam that I already have.  The shipment came fast.  It isn't the best in the world for IS but you wont find that at this reasonable pricepoint. I recommend for birding, fun with pets, time lapse, travel and those on a budget.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,1
Great camera for $80 it performs what I use it for very well compared to a gopro. I use it for fishing on a chest mount and at 1/4 the price of a gopro this is a easy choice. Extra batteries are cheap and a 32gb sd card cost $10 provides about 3 hours of 1080p footage.Video quality is great just gets some lens flairs looking directly into the sun. I've gotten into recording my fishing trips for much less then a gopro and if it wasn't for the akaso I would be able to afford too so thank you Akaso.,5,1,2017-9-8,1,1,1
"Camera is great. The plastic is kind of thin but when inside of the waterproof case, it is very rigid and durable. It is super light which is nice for when I put it on my quadcopter. Very disappointing when the packaging was all messed up and all the accessories were just thrown in a sandwich bag. Its very sad that people would return an item like that and also that Amazon sent it to me like that but I didn't want to wait to get a new one and thankfully it works great. I do recommend this camera, the accessories are good quality, it comes with two batteries, it has a wide field of view, and it supports 64 gb micro SD card!",5,1,2018-8-6,1,1,0
"My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours!",1,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0

I’m big on video editing and making home videos for our kids and we love being out on the lake and wakeboarding and also riding dirt bikes and quads so we stray it to the boat and our helmets! this was an amazing deal.

"From what I have seen so far, this is a very nice unit for the price of it. I don’t think that it feels as solid as a GoPro, based on my limited exposure. But obviously at one third the price, of a GoPro, how could it feel as solid? My initial video test seems good for my needs. Being that I don’t plan on BASE jumping or snowboarding with it, I am confident that it should hold up and do the job that I need.",4,1,2018-12-29,1,0,0
"This is a very budget-friendly camcorder that gets the job done. I've only taken it out a few times to try, so far its been very easy to use and the quality is great for the cost. The sound quality could use some work, it's not terrible, it's just not amazing. I wish there was an option to install an external microphone to use, but other than that I have no regrets with this purchase. Really handy for fishing if you use it in a chest mount, the angle of the lens captures the action and scenery very nicely.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I got this for my 12yo son as a starter camera. He enjoys being able to take it everywhere, including attaching it to his bike. The included features (waterproofing, various brackets, remote control, some smartdevice connectivity) are nice additions to the overall experience. The video quality is decent, the still photos not so much. It's easy to transfer data to another machine for processing via flash memory. I would say my biggest complaint is that the LCD view screen is pretty lackluster.  Off-angle viewing is pretty bad, and in bright sunlight, it is difficult to see much of anything. Overall, my son likes it, so I'm pleased.  This one was decent price for a starter action camera. I'd consider buying an upgraded model once this one dies.",3,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"A very pleasant surprise. The camera feels high quality and operates without any of the quirks inexpensive electronics often have. Easy software install and pairing. Lots of mounting hardware options included. Image quality is great. I love it.The only problem is one is not enough. What about a dash cam. or motorcycle handlebar cam, or a cam to monitor the baby birds in that nest over there? I just ordered 2 more cameras (one has the touch screen).  It will be interesting to see how the remote functions (or doesn't) with 3 cameras running.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"This is my first action camera. It’s a good machine and does what I wanted it to do. There is a learning curve in that I’m still trying to figure out how everything works. Volume is weird in that I can hear the recorded audio if I play back on the device, but not if I play it on my phone. The iSmart DV app works better than the Asako DV app. Definitely download the user manual. I think a lot of my issues are from user error. The picture quality is great. There are several mounting options packaged with the camera. The time lapse function is for photos, not video, so you’ll need a separate program to install the photos as frames. Overall, I’m glad I decided to purchase this.",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"First of all- you always hear that ""you get what you pay for"" well that may be true but with this camera you get alot more.  Our daughters are on travel softball teams and we didn't want to spend a fortune on a name brand that will only be used 2-3 times a month so after reading a few reviews-we picked up one of these cameras.  While the software and interface my not be the greatest the pictures and videos that this camera take are awesome.  Very impressed with this little camera considering the price.  So far we have only used a few hours but I expect to get a few more hours this weekend as we have 5-6 games.  Will update as needed but def do not regret this purchase.",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0

Screen and menu are easy to use and you can work you way around electronics. I use this for camping, backpacking, kayak fishing and taking video of my kids. Probably not a 1 for 1 gopro replacement, but then again I am a casual user not needing to have all the benefits that come with spending what they costs. I bought the small amazon action camera case to carry a few accessories and batteries and it fits fine. you'll be hard pressed to use all the attachments that come with these kind of cameras. They all seem to interchange without issue.  Ask me any questions, I'd be glad to answer as best as I can.",5,1,2017-2-22,1,1,0
"I was searching for an economical camera that I could mount on my bike or helmet when I go mountain biking. This Akaso camera has by far exceeded  my expectations for the price of it. First it does not look cheap at all and comes with all and more accessories necessary. The image quality is excellent. The app and file transfer was also very easy.  It’s also pretty sturdy in its plastic case. I had a hard crash on my mountain bike and nothing happened to the case or the camera! I was pretty banged up however! If you’re looking for a camera to record all your actions, Asako is definitely it.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"I had a second generation GoPro that i lost and needed to replace prior to a trip to Mexico. The GoPro prices were higher than I wanted to pay so I did a search and came across the AKASO EK7000. I was shocked by how reasonable the prices were but was skeptical that it seemed too low. I read all the reviews and watched YouTube videos and figured it was worth a shot. It came with a lot of extra pieces and two batteries!! I charged one up, popped it in, and tested it out. I was very happy with the picture and sound. I downloaded the app and was able to easily get the videos to my device.I’m very happy with my budget buy. I will probably give this one to my daughter and buy another one for myself.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I bought a GoPro 4 like 5 years ago, but that cost a whole lot more than this gadget.  In functionality, they are almost comparable, but the buttons usage on the Akaso are more intuitive. You can basically start testing it without reading the user’s guide which is a big plus.  Hey, 4K industry standard and wide-angle, what else do y want?  I have not tested the waterproof quality but I am it is fine because I used this design before. Surely, the versatility will be controlled through the software, can’t wait to try all of them, esp with fast action Sports!!!",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,1
"This is a great budget alternative for a GoPro. I mainly used it for audio quality (DCI hornline) and it was pretty good (NO CASE) and the picture at 1080p 60 FPS was great!! The only downside is the app sucks, and you can't get your videos from the camera straight to the app, only through a micro-sd to your computer. Highly recommend if you need an action camera on a budget.",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

"The camera is really good for the price that it is. I think it’s better for video rather than pictures, but the pictures are still pretty good. I found that even though the camera was in the waterproof case it would pick up sound sometimes. I really enjoy using the camera and I think it’s a great starter camera. It’s pretty user friendly once you get the hang of it but it was confusing at first with the minimal instructions.

I like to give a product several months before reviewing. This was a gift for a 10 year old budding YouTube star.As an inexpensive alternative to a GoPr this hits the mark. It is easy to use and video quality is outstanding. Battery life is short but it came with two and charge time is quick. Get extra batteries if on an extended trip away from a charging source. Compatible with a myriad of attachments that come with or can be cheaply purchased for this camera. Quality of camera and accessories is good. A suggestion if not used underwater change cased back for the non-waterproof accessory otherwise sound is muted.,5,1,2018-2-25,1,0,0
This is an outstanding camera for the money. I bought this for my 10 year old son and he has had so much fun making videos. He first tested in a swimming pool and the camera worked like a charm with no water issues. We could even hear the sound going down the water slide and hitting the water. The other amazing thing about this camera is how many accessories it comes with. There just can’t be a better value out there for the money.....

"Downgrading from 5* to 2*. This camera has been used extensively for about 10 months and, during that period, worked great. Other than that, things were great: good price, great battery life, easy to use. The remote was a nice addition. There are only two downsides: one minor and one major. The latch for the battery cover is really stiff. The camera stopped working after about 10 months -- completely dead -- no lights, no screen, not recognized as a USB device when plugged into a computer, etc.",2,1,2018-3-31,1,0,0

"So let me start this by saying, this is not a bad camera at all for the money. That said, the aforementioned says it all. I learned at a very early age that you get what you pay for, and this stands absolutely true. This is an 85 camera once you factor in the cost of batteries/mounts etc. It's nothing more than that.So with that out of the way, let's talk specifics. This camera is built to compete with GoPro, of that there is no question; And for the cost, on paper anyways, it seems like a formidable competitor. That aside though, the picture and video quality just isn't that good. It's not bad, but it's not $400 GoPro good. Now, when you take the specs of various GoPros, this camera is nearest comparable to the Hero 3+ Black Edition of which I have 5. I admittedly bought this camera as I wanted a cheap Dash Cam I wouldn't fret about leaving in my daily driver, as opposed to one of my more expensive GoPros. Thus far, the camera performs that task well enough, but I'll talk about the cons briefly.",2,1,2017-1-17,1,2,1

"I got this camera to take along for my kayak fishing adventures. Picture is great, but audio is extremely poor. You essentially have to yell if you expect it to pick up audio while in it’s case. I have an iPhone with the Akaso mobile app. The app is well designed, however when synced with the cam, it constantly freezes, so virtually useless for me. The red light that blinks while filming goes off eventually, so you are never certain if you are actually filming or not. If all you are after is video, this is a decent buy. If you want audio and more app functionality on your phone, I would keep looking.",3,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
"We bought this camera for our seven year old that was demanding a go-pro for Christmas. For the money, this little camera has been great! It has tons of connections, and the picture quality is pretty darn good!If you don't have the budget for something like a go-pro, this should be on your list.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I bought this camera for my husband at Christmas. We are taking a honeymoon in March and I thought the underwater case would be perfect since we plan on snorkeling. The camera itself is sturdy but lightweight. We did a little bit of recording with it just to test it out and the picture quality is excellent. It also has great sound quality so there is no need for an extra microphone. All of the sound will be picked up by the camera. The camera package included a few accessory items but more are available for purchase. My husband especially liked that it is compatible with GoPro accessories.In addition to video, this camera also takes pictures and has a mode for timed pictures. It also has a shutter mode where you can take multiple at one time.",5,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0
I searched for hours to find an inexpensive  to the (other) water proof action cameras. I was kind of skeptical about this camera after reading certain reviews but after trying it out a couple of times I am extremely satisfied with it.The underwater clearity is awesome. We have donr some underwater fish feeding videos and some off road videos with the unit strapped to the front of a side by side ATV . I was impressed with the stability and crisp video this camera captures.,5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"I have a go pro and got this b/c it's much cheaper. It's definitely comparable. My only thing is that the clip to the battery doesn't clip in correctly, it is always crooked so it's hard to pry out when I need to replace the battery. I'm concerned it will break off at some point and if it does the battery will definitely not stay put.",4,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0

"Great bang for the buck! Came with lots of extras and was impressed with the extra battery and charging cord. Only wish it came with a memory card.Update: we’ve had this for a month now. It floats by itself as long as it’s in the waterproof case! The picture quality is not amazing, but I got this for my 6 year old to have fun with. I cannot get it tohook up to my iPhone, but a friend was able to get it hooked up to his. Battery life is fairly sufficient, but it’s definitely nice to keep the extra one on hand and charged.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I bought this camera before a trip I took this past month that included snorkeling, hiking etc that a camera like this is perfect for. It shot some amazing footage for us, and it works exactly as expected. Having an app connect to the camera was really nice, it was such an easy way to review footage / copy files off the camera. The quality was good, but the sound was ok (but what do you expect when it is encased in a plastic waterproof case?)The only real downside was the plastic waterproof case. The first one showed up with a cracked case (which was easy enough to return/refund). The second case did fine except the hinge for the backdoor is already rusty! We have only had the thing for less than a month and it already has rust. Keep in mind that the camera still works fine, and the case still is waterproof. It is just a little disappointing to see rust this early in owning the product.",4,1,2018-1-16,1,1,1
"So I bought this little camera for hunting and some off roading, and so far the picture quality is alright. Not what I expected but better then some. Only problem is the base on the unit is broke so I can't attach it to anything. The base was broken in the mail before i got it in the box. Kind of surprised because the box seems pretty well secured. I'm hoping the company will fix this for me but we'll see",1,1,2017-9-21,1,2,1
"I bought this camera for my husband to take on his annual elk hunt. He hunts at 9,000 to 10,000 feet during November. It is usually cold and snowing and i wanted to see why he loved being up there. When he got home,  all of his recordings were 15 to 20 seconds long and I asked him why. He said the battery life was only that long and when it dies the camera stopped.  He also said, when here at 790 feet it lasts about an hour and a half. Too bad he can't use it where we intended him to use it. He is now looking to purchase a Sony 4K Camcorder for $400 that others have that does do the job.",3,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
"I take a lot of nature photography while hiking, kayaking and bicycling and I wanted a waterproof camera that I could use to take pictures of manatees on the Chassahowitzka River and dolphins at the beach. I did a lot of research on the action cams available and read a lot of reviews before choosing the AKASO EK7000.What sold me was the extra battery and the positive reviews, what made me happy on receiving the camera was all of the accessories that came with the product that have to be purchased separately with other cameras.",5,1,2016-12-28,1,1,0
"I got this as a beginner version of a GoPro.  It's worked ok as a dashcam on adventures, but everything else I've tried using it for (time lapses, overhead videos of the art projects I work on, etc) have been a problem.  The batteries die fast, and the numbering/sequencing on for the time lapse photo files resets or resequences every time I have to swap the battery.  I've also noticed that files become corrupt, although it could be more of a memory card issue than the camera's fault.  At any rate, I think this camera is better for outdoor use rather than indoor use.",3,1,2018-4-16,1,0,0
"I love this little camera! I bought this for my trip to Thailand, not wanting to spend a ton of money on a GoPro in case it got lost or stolen. The waterproof case worked really well at first, but the lens part came loose and let in water after a few uses in the ocean at a very shallow depth. The camera continued to work despite being exposed to sea water. I took mostly videos with it, which turned out great! I had trouble downloading the photos and videos onto my phone through the accompanying app.",4,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"A lot came with the Cam. Including two batteries, which do not work. Effectively making the camera useless. Camera works fine plugged in to a power source tho.Edit:  they sent me a new camera a few weeks later.  So far every thing seems to work. It was a gift for my husband so I’m not 100% sure.  He hasn’t said anything negative tho.",5,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0
"I bought this for my teenage nephew so he could use it with his friends skateboarding and doing other activities.

"We love this action camera. We purchased this for recording our three year old around the house and on camping trips. We went for this camera as it is a cheaper option then most action cameras and figured having a three year old holding/operating it, this would be a wiser choice. The water proof case is a true water proof case and we also use it as a protective case from falls when the kid has the camera running around. The battery holds up well when recording and the quality of the picture is great. The camera all around is user friendly and well worth the purchase. I have recommended this product to family and so I'd recommend it to you too.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

"Enjoyed camera for about one month! Good quality of the picture. It supports 4k 25 fps, but I prefer to user 1080 60 fps because of much more recording time. Sound quality is not bad, but anyway it's always better to use the separate microphone for wind filtering.I liked a lot mini HDMI port - I connect the camera directly to the TV.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
There is a difference between taking pictures on a timer and a Time Lapse movie. I bought this camera with the idea of creating Time Lapse movies for my projects. This camera takes pictures on a timer. It is possible to have it take multiple pictures on a continuous timer which does not constitute a Time Lapse. So I ended up using my Iphone to create my Time Lapse movies after all.,3,1,2019-4-24,1,0,0
"I had just recently bought this camera for when i ride my horses. I go through the woods and through mountains, as well as jump! I wanted to get a decent camera, nothing much, but WOW!! Am I impressed! This camera has THE best camera quality that I have ever seen. Everything is 4k quality, it is incredibly easy to use, and VERY light weight. it attaches to my helmet so easily- takes about 20 seconds! I have gone on many trail rides with it, and it is now my best friend. super durable, and I love it! I have had  to send back multiple cameras before. This one however, is my favorite one. Better than a gopro! Comes with almost everything you need! it never slides or bounces on my helmet- just stays in place. Am I in love with it? YESS!",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"An excellent camera that has some terrific features (like being waterproof!) and a REALLY great price!For all the accessories you get in the box and the clarity of the video, this camera ""could"" easily be worth way more than the MSRP of $140, and really, even at that price, it's still a steal.  Getting it for under $100?  Get it now!",5,1,2017-2-11,1,0,0

"I've owned several action cameras and this one by far exceeded my expectations. It also comes with many cool accessories, two batteries and a remote control. Very easy to use and the picture quality is on par with other action cameras 3-4 times more expensive. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take superb 4K videos and photos. The only thing I found lacking was the instructions, although there is a link provided to download a user manual.",5,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0
"Excellent. I am very satisfied. The delivery was extremely fast, it took under a day. In addition, the camera comes with a large amount of accessories. There are mounts that can be used for several situations. Within minutes, I was able to use wifi/bluetooth to connect the camera to my phone and view/download the pictures to it. I also managed to connect it to my son's phone with ease. The camera is sturdy and comes with two batteries. The photo quality is as good as it gets for an action camera of its price. I used it for fishing today and will use it for snorkeling soon. So far, so good. In addition, it is super simple to operate: it only has four buttons.I recommend it to anyone.",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
I just got this item this week and am starting to use it learning as I go. I have managed to figure out the basic stuff intuitively without reading the manual yet. I look forward to learning about the more advanced features.The package came with a bunch of attachments but I was not able to use these to attach the item inside my car so I suggest buying extra attachments.,4,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0

My son wanted a GoPro but at his age......the price is so high so we found this alternative camera on Amazon and looked thru reviews and it also came with a great assortment of accessories.

Can't wait to use it the rest of summer to get some great action videos and pictures.,5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,1
"Bought this for my bike riding adventures with my friends on nature trails.  It's easy to set up (WiFi and remote capabilities, for remote picture and video).  Love that it has a wrist strap on the remote, so you don't have to fumble looking for buttons that are physically ON the camera to start your video/take your picture.  I love that it comes with two batteries, because with a spare I don't have to worry about my camera dying in the middle of a ride.The video quality is impressively good.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
It was getting hot every time I turned on.Update: I received the replacement of this product. I have another action cam and the sound of the video wasn’t good but this one is great.

"This camera is awesome for the price. I did a lot of research on camera's before buying one and this one kept beating the pricey competition by a long shot. Great starter cam for sure.

Usef this camera to record zip line adventure at Marble Mountain Zip Line in Canada. Used clip on mount to attach to my helmet and got unexpected great movie shots.

"I bought this camera for my honeymoon to Hawaii. By using the special casing that comes with it, we were able to take great pictures of fishes and turtles underwater while we were snorkeling. The interface can be a bit confusing due to the limited number of buttons, but you get used to it after playing around with it for a bit. Considering the price though, I think it was a really good buy. It also gave me peace of mind while out on boats, as I didn't have to risk dropping my phone in the ocean while taking pictures of wildlife.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
The product is great to use comes with everything you need to get filming minus the Micro SD Card which didn't bother me since most the time the ones companies put in don't have the memory capacity I use so I always use my own anyway.PROS,4,1,2019-2-5,1,0,0
It's quite a solid camera for the price and has held up to a decent amount of wear and clumsiness from me. My only real qualm with it is it tends to overheat pretty quickly and I don't know if it's a good idea to continue using as I think it might damage the camera. This is unfortunate because it interferes with taking really long videos. Good for the price though.,4,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"If you are looking for an alternative to the GoPro cameras, this is your answer. I wanted several cameras to capture video of my band and of me playing drums from different angles.

"I liked the overall design and fair amount of options out of the box. I didn't like having to purchase a video card, as it doesn't come with one, but realize this is a way to keep the costs low. It did take a bit to figure out how to maneuver through menu items, and the bluetooth/wireless side was a bit slow. That said, once I figured out how to shoot a video, which is very easy with the remote they give you, and then export to my desktop, it's easy to share videos and pictures with friends by text or social media. I would recommend this as a fair alternative to an expensive GOPro.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"The order comes with many accessories...more than what I know what to do with some.  The quality of the video recorded is very good and clear as well as volume.

"Pretty good so far. This camera was really easy to set up with wifi versus some of the GoPro's I have. I have had a problem with the camera just shutting off, but I am not sure it is not user error. If you are looking for a cheap and good camera that could potentially get lost or damaged I would recommend this.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"I recently bought this to use to record my grilling/BBQ videos. I’ve been testing out the camera and learning its features. Just takes a little bit of working with the camera to become familiar with all the features. So far, so good! I definitely recommend.

My son is absolutely thrilled with his gift!!,5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"Only one reason I am giving this camera 1 star.  It loses time and date and has to be reset every time you change the battery.  This is about the lamest thing I've seen on any product ever.  So there is no such thing as quickly changing the battery and continuing a sequence of pictures or videos that can be sorted by the time stamp without resetting the Date and Time.  Not sure if everyone has this problem or there is a defect with the camera I have.  Too late to return it, didn't discover this until after I'd had the camera for a while.",1,1,2017-8-26,1,3,0

"Straight out of the box the camera worked great. Until I put it into the waterproof case. It loses wi fi as soon as it goes under the surface of the water and the camera freezes, only way to turn it off is yanking out battery.

"I just received my EK7000 and it has performed flawlessly out of the box. This is my first ever action camera and I researched a while before deciding on the right one to purchase. I read plenty of negative reviews about Akaso offering free items in return for positive reviews. My EK7000 came with no such offer. It did come with a dual charging dock which was a bonus. Also, take the time to move beyond Amazon to do your homework. This camera was well reviewed and rated on multiple other sites and that is what led to my purchase of this particular item. My camera is still new to me and I'm learning about all the features but so far I am happy with the purchase. I'm sure other, more expensive models do have more impressive features but this is a great, budget-friendly action camera that does exactly what it is supposed to.

Spent a lot of time snorkeling to about 25 ft/ 8m and hit 60ft a few times with no leakage.  Did a scuba trip and spent about 40 minutes between 90 ft and 100 ft and briefly hit a max depth of  127 ft/ 37m and found a few drops of water in the case after the dive with no damage to case or camera. Got the photos so that my non-swimming wife could see what's down there. Can't speak to image quality as compared to something else but it was at least adequate for my purposes. Very happy with this purchase.,5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
These cameras are incredible for the money... I am very impressed with the quality of video they produce. Only downfalls I see are that they dont give you a separate charger (you have to charge the battery in the camera) and second that they dont really give you a good mounting solution for a vehicle...like a suction cup mount. You will probably want to buy a charger and mount right away...The other must have is an external microphone.. I used a Rode VideoMicro microphone.,4,1,2017-5-10,1,1,0

"We purchased this as an affordable alternative to a GoPro. We based our purchase off of the existing reviews and hoped that the quality was as good as people stated. We tested the camera with some action shots, action video and underwater video (at the beach). The quality was great! We were very impressed with the stabilization throughout the video. The underwater shots are very clear and the protective case worked with no issues. We have not taken the camera more than 2 feet deep though, so I can only attest for shallow submersion. Though the camera came with a lot of attachments, we probably won't use most of them since we got this camera for our honeymoon (snorkeling and such). But for someone who participates in action sports, you will likely have most everything you need to get started. I recommend this camera to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative to the GoPro.",5,1,2017-5-25,1,1,0

The GoPro cameras were simply too much for what I was going to be using it for. I found the EK7000 on Amazon and decided to give it a try for $68. Other than the battery not lasting terribly long it is a great little camera for the price. I have had it for a little over a month and it is working out exactly as I had hoped. Connecting to a 10,000 mAh battery during games solves the battery issue. Controlling the camera from my phone or tablet allows me to mount the camera where I can get the best video while not having to be right next to it. Would buy again.",5,1,2018-4-21,1,0,0

You have to buy a “brand name” card separately, but when the camera didn’t work, and I called the company, they said we had to buy a “Samsung” card.  So, we jumped through that hoop, formatted the disk, and the camera still locked up, shut off, had artifacts in the playback, and finally just flat out recorded nothing to disk.  Life got busy and we missed the window to return it, but basically, it’s crap.",1,1,2019-4-6,1,1,0
"I love to record all of my adventures. I never had usage for a camera as I used my smartphone for everything but being that we went to Macchu Picchu, Peru for our honeymoon, I wanted to have quality backup camera coverage. Little did I know what I have been missing all these years. When one thinks of filming action sports or adventures, the word Go-Pro immediately comes to mind but after doing hours of exhaustive research, reviewing all the specs, cost and accessories, the Akaso EK7000 was the camera for me. Not only did it not disappoint, it comes with mounts and straps for just about everything so I was able to use my wristband remote to control when to record, take a picture and when to stop. I highly recommend this camera to anyone, even just for the mounts alone for the cost. Not to mention it comes with two batteries that record for around 30-40 minutes each before dying. Even when those die, it comes with a charger so if you have a portable charger, you can potentially record for hours on end. I cannot wait to compile my Macchu Picchu footage and make a video out of it.",5,1,2017-9-13,1,1,0
"This product met all my expectations so far. It comes with a lot of accessories, two batteries, straps, remote control and etc. I was able to take pictures and videos right away. I also download the app and was able to connect to the camera through wifi. This product definitely is worth the price. The only thing I found inconvenient is it does not come with a manual. I have to google online to figure out how to connect to wifi. And that is why I gave four stars.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
"This camera comes with fantastic packaging, very similar to my GoPro, and with a ton of attachment accessories. So far I have used it for underwater video, at less than 20 ft, and on a rifle barrel. It performs as well, or better than my GoPro in both environments.Some had expressed concern about low light shooting, but I had no issues with that underwater, or shooting at dusk. The response time to record is a little delayed using the remote, but I got the timing of that sorted pretty quick.",5,1,2017-8-31,1,1,0
Purchased this action camera for my daughter for her birthday and wish I had videos and photos from it to show but I don’tThis camera works great as well as the remote!!

I enjoy my GoPro but next time when I need to replace mine I will be ordering this action camera!!,5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I figured this was cheap enough that if it was junk, I didn't lose too much. I figured the quality would be meh, but didn't realize how bad it would be. The colors and saturation were way off and the pictures were grainy and undefined. I ended up getting a $5 drybag for my cellphone and have been using that instead. I'd still really love to find an adequate budget sport camera, but this wasn't it.",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I bought this camera hoping that it was close to a go pros quality, how ever when I first opened the camera and turned it on, since I only had a 2GB micro sd card, I could only record about 11 minutes of 1080p at 60 fps, which it did rather well for under 100$. I was very pleased to see the it actually does shoot in 4K if you have a 64gb micro sd card in it. The quality of the camera is pretty good, and the image it produces is great for under 100$. I think it is a pretty good little camera, but if you are looking to use for more than just for fun, I wouldn't recommend it.",4,1,2017-1-19,1,1,0
"The video quality is great, the sound not so much but for the price that''s not a deal breaker. Personally i don't like that it doesn't have a zoom, but again, for the price not a big deal.  I like the fact that i could plug it into my computer and use it for live streaming and it didn't drain the battery on the camera, I did have to do research to find out that in order to use it for live streaming, i had to remove the memory card. but all in all i don't regret my purchase, it's definitely worth it.",4,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help.

"I got this camera for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it! It works very well and for a reasonable price. This camera is perfect for any adventure and we plan to continue using it. The picture quality is very clear even when underwater as the camera advertises. I was a little nervous because I thought you had to buy a very expensive camera to get good pictures, but this one is more than sufficient. Although we don't plan to use it underwater as much, the times we did there was no problems. The camera still continues to work well. It was smaller than I expected but I think the stand that it came with really helps to take level and clear pictures. I encourage people to buy this camera. Well worth it!",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

This is amazing and I don't see how it is $85. I previously used this camera on a ski trip and got some very good footage in 1080p 60fps (Video Attached Below).

"This is a great little action camera. It is super tiny and portable. I’ve used a Go Pro and this case is verge similar to it. It worked great, no water. You can’t beat the price! It’s not quite as good as the Go Pro, but it’s pretty close and it’s a fraction of the price. And I’m a professional videographer so I’m picky. Honestly you can’t beat the price for this good, tiny camera. It also came with a bunch of accessories and ties. I only wish it had directions explaining how to use some of them and the only one I wanted, which it didn’t come with, is a handle bar to hold the camera when underwater.  I’d recommend this for sure, so worth the price.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"This camera does a nice job of serving as a budget GoPro.  It takes decent photos and video, I like that it comes with two batteries, and it's a value price.

"I purchased this camera because I was headed to Punta Cana and wanted a good camera which can also record video which is waterproof as well. After looking throughout Amazon, I decided upon this one and am pleasantly surprised by its features and accessories as well. The camera housing is watertight and the buttons are still usable when under water which is great. It also comes with the remote which is a nice addition so that I can combine it with the accessory pack and not even have to be touching the camera to take a photo or video. It allows me to connect to my phone over WiFi as well which is a great feature. I really like the camera and am now looking forward to using it on other trips as well!",5,1,2018-5-5,1,0,0
"Bought this for a test that was supposed to practically destroy the camera.

"My son wanted a GoPro, but couldn't afford the bill. I read the reviews and they were all so good, so we bought this one. And it has been just what he needed. It came with a ton of accessories for him to use it in different ways and  attach it to his bike and use easily. The instructions are easy to follow - there are one a few buttons, but tons of ways to use it. Our family has only scratched the surface of putting this to use and we are pleased! I mentioned our purchase to a friend and he said he has the same one and loves it too. Can't wait to document our adventures!!",5,1,2019-3-11,1,1,0
I got this as a gift for my 12yo son. He loves it! He uses it on his helmet/bike as well as while shooting his air soft. I’m sure through the years he will use it to film all of his dare devil stunts. It’s small & lightweight. Only bummer was that I didn’t notice I needed to buy an SD card. A reminder when buying would be great but ultimately my bad not realizing. Great buy!,5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,1

Just received this in the mail today. It took me a while to figure out how to get the camera out of the box. I ended up using an electric screwdriver to get the camera out. There are a bunch of accessories that I haven't figured out how to use yet. Most of the accessories are mounts I believe. I tried out the wifi function and that worked without problem.

If you're doing anything bumpy, the battery WILL come loose and nothing you do will be captured/saved up to the point that it shuts off. There's literally nothing holding the battery in place, you just push it up into the camera and pray that it decides to stay in the chamber. Unacceptable.",1,1,2019-4-28,1,1,0

The ease of use right out of the box is ridonculous!  There's an app for your phone that connects to the camera via wifi and you can literally watch my son's POV nerf battles live on our flat screen TV...how cool is that.

I really wanted to love this. The pictures are amazing. I have the new Mac book and I got the correct sd card. It worked amazing the first two days then it wouldn’t hold movies correctly. I didn’t change anything on the format and also it wouldn’t hold the correct date etc. every time I changed the battery it would reset.

"Great quality especially for the price did use this camera to dive in multiple places on our trip for snorkeling and scuba diving. the quality could be a little better but it is great like I said for the price. I really liked the feature where you can sync your phone to the camera and upload the photos right to your phone to post right away. But it took a while to find the photos in my phone due to them not popping up right away in my gallery. It was a real joy to have this camera along. The quality of the stuff so far I have used, it has been great. Except for the wristlet to use, it has started to fray a bit. The camera durability is also great while I was heading out to the reef to dive I slipped and fell and the camera took a hit but still work perfectly and is still waterproof, has little scuff but it just gives it more character. The fall did not affect the camera. Overall great piece of equipment for a vacation or for amateur water stuff.",4,1,2019-1-21,1,0,1
"First off, the SD card is not included. They consider it an accessory yet the camera does not function without it. Second, the USB cord was not in the package but should have been.

I haven't tried the camera yet but even if it functions as expected, I will not be recommending this unit. Buyer beware.",1,1,2018-4-10,1,1,0

There's a lot more expensive options out there but I stumbled upon this one, the reviews seem great and it was cheap compared to other cameras. Decided to try it out and I couldn't be more pleased. This camera is really easy to use and takes great quality videos, especially underwater. Above water is just the same, very easy to switch between photos and videos but mostly used this camera for taking videos.

Bought for taking videos surfing and bodyboarding. Waterproof housing leaked immediately despite looking at all instructions on how to close housing door etc etc. Looking at prior reviews I realized I was taking a gamble as there are a significant complaints about leaking case. Took the gamble b/c the price was fair. Unfortunately it  didn't work out. Decided to go with Gopro Hero5 Session with added waterproof case to ease our concerns. More expensive but worth piece of mind. Personal opinion - Akaso has a design law in the waterproof case they need to address. Thank God for Amazon's refund policy with these sellers.,1,1,2018-7-2,1,1,0
We had purchased this for our 7 year old daughter and wanted something she could take pictures with underwater and pictures that were good enough for printing or backgrounds on computer(which many cheap cameras lack). This camera is great and being able to connect via wifi to the camera directly to share the photos to our iPhones made it even better no more looking for adapters to hook to the computer. Came with 2 batteries which was a plus as well. Overall impressed with the quality of even the under water pictures. Kids have a blast with it. Highly recommended for the price.,5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

We bought this for our 12 year old. He wanted a go pro but I wasn't about to pay that kind of money. It has held up good and has great video quality.

Very well designed product with many good features for a great price.  Bought this for my son and myself to make fun little videos and has an amazing picture quality.  The buttons at first were a little confusing on how to navigate through the settings but was able to easily catch on.  The clips and mounting brackets all seem to be of very good quality and do not seem as though they would break easily.  My only concern is if the cap for the battery will holdup as it seems to fit a little loose.

"It comes with a whole lot of performance, features and accessories for the money. I'm literally amazed that they can sell this for under a hundred bucks and still make money. As far as I can tell, it's on par with the GoPro except for low-light conditions. When it's dark, the GoPro captures better contrast. However, they're both pretty bad in the dark and you really shouldn't be trying to use any small-sensor camera in low light! Get one!... heck, get two!",5,1,2017-4-8,1,1,0

Here are my thoughts so far after playing around with it a couple of weeks.  If you use the camera properly, good mounting, you get pretty good video. I'm pleased with the quality for this price (third of GoPro Hero) though! The remote that it comes with works really well. I really like that feature. The kit does come with 2 batteries. I think they're only half charged, and you should charge them before use. One thing I'm being careful of is the lens because I don't know what material they are, on the camera or the case.

I've had the camera for a couple of weeks and so far it is working great.  It came with a ton of extras one being a mount that fit my motocross helmet very well.  The audio recording isn't very loud while in the waterproof case.  It was also impossible to tell if the camera was recording while using the remote.  It's suppose to beep but the beeps are so quiet you can't hear it with a helmet on.  Other than that the recordings are very good.  Overall it was better than expected for such a good price.,4,1,2016-10-1,1,2,0

Additionally 50% of the files that I have ever recorded on this thing have been corrupted and unviewable.

It came with everything we needed, plenty of mounts, waterproof case, 2 batteries, remote, extra straps and a charger that will charge both batteries simultaneously (great idea). Only thing we had to supply was the micro SD card which we had extras of. The picture quality is great and the menus on the camera are very user friendly. We are looking forward to making plenty of family ski trip videos this winter and taking it to the lakes in the summer. Great product, would highly recommend!",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
I got this specifically for Rugged Maniac -- a 5k I was planning on doing.. and wanted to have it recorded and on the info on it said battery life lasted up to two hours fully charged. I literally charged the battery fully the night before and didn't even put it in the camera until I was at the starting line.. when I finished ( about 2 hours later ) the camera was already dead. when I got home and switched the battery out to a new one I realized it had only recorded like 30 min of the race. I was really disappointed :( :(,2,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
So I bought one of these to use as a webcam because I couldn't find a decent one anywhere. Hooked it up super easy and was impressed on the quality I was getting. I used it as an action cam for a bit to test it out to see how it performed and thought it was great. 4k 60fps was nice but I thought the 1080p was clearer for some reason. Anyway I ordered 4 more just to have a back up and give to my buddies for when we go camping to get some video and have fun. Will probably order more honestly just to have around. I was definitely happy with the product for the price.,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"For the price you should not be allowed to complain. I have been shooting with this camera all weekend and love it. It comes with a ton of accessories, and the quality is just about as good as the Gopro costing more than 4 times as much. It is easy to operate and has a LCD screen on its back. It feels sturdy and did not break when I dropped it... only once. Sound is just ok but that really is not what these action camera are for. If you want to see the quality of both photo and video, check out the video I made. I definitely recommend this camera.  To see the video type in, ""photojunky drone zone"" , and there is a full review with a lot of footage.UPDATED: I have shot with this camera over a month and have made several videos. My final conclusion is... Gopro has set the standard, so most people use the quality of the Gopro as a measuring stick. This camera although good and incredible for the price is not as good in some aspects when compared to the Gopro. The image is more contrasty than the Gopro so in shadows you lose some detail. The colors seem a bit saturated and produce a less realistic image. This can be changed with an editor if you really need to, but not the loss of shadow detail. Build quality is good especially when you take into account the price. and the LCD screen on the back makes everything a lot easier such as settings and actually being able to see what you are filming. After a month of hard use I definitely recommend this camera. If you want to see a side by side comparison, go to youtube and seach ""Photojunky Drone Zone"" . There you will see two video reviews.",5,1,2016-10-23,1,4,1
"Not a bad camera for the money, good entry level, what it’s missing is the image stability that the go-pro has. I use this unit on my race car and it can get very shaky almost unwatchable, where a GoPro has a solid picture. But if your just using this mounted to yourself or underwater not bad for the money",4,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"Had it two days before my friend blasted it when I had it down range. 22 lr so definitely not bullet proof. very good camera though for the price for any general filming and the waterproofing seemed to be sturdy, though i never tried it. this is only a 4 star though because the quality was very skippy when controlling using wifi (video saved is not skippy, just the stream).",4,1,2020-8-12,1,0,1
"in all honesty the only thing I do not like about this camera is the small amount of pixel blur that happens in 4k. Other than that no qualms. Have an autistic some that does not enjoy his picture taken, This camera is small and durable enough to just slide in my pocket and catch his smiles on surprise. Already thinking of buying another!",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,1
"Very well packaged, box was sturdy which I felt that it would be of good quality.  Very smooth and did not glitch at all.  Pictures that transferred to my phone well...unbelievable.  on its maiden trip I went on a rough bike trail and was quite stable.

I am 12 years old and I received this great gift for my birthday",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"Like other folks here, I had a really hard time getting the mount off of the water resistant case.

"Listen, this is not a GoPro. BUT you're not paying for one either. This is great for what it is and does a great job at what it's designed for.

There was a defect with the waterproof case and a replacement was shipped quickly and at no extra cost.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,1,0

This is the second one i've purchased. I did buy a similar version by a different company and the picture quality was horrible. I sent that one back and got the OKASO as my second cam. Comes with a ton of accessories. They did forget my battery charger but the camera charges one battery at a time and that's ok with me. They also offered return but i opted for a partial refund because i wanted to keep the camera. I'm satisfied with both cameras for flying powered paragliding.,4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"This is a great little webcam.  I bought it to use for a trip to Alaska this coming summer but it has so many more uses.  We have hunting dogs and it is so nice to strap it on them also and watch what they are seeing.  I also bought the accessory kit also sold on Amazon and it has everything in it you could possibly want...the head strap, the chest strap and the floater for watching fish bite your fishing line.",5,1,2017-1-29,1,3,0
"Like the extras and what the unit can do.....but the video is jumpy. I have tried changing the setting on video, converting it to mpg4, wmv, and still jumpy. I will update the rating as I deal with the company. I would not buy them if I new. I bought 2 units and tons of extras. Now may all be thrown awayUpdate....the video issue seems to be fixed. I reset the camera, formatted the memory card, and took it out. It is night atm, and the picture is horrible at night. Definitely not a night camera. But the choppy video seems to be fixed. I try again in the daylight and see. So I bumped it from 2 to 3 stars. Ill give another update tomorrow when I do the next test.",3,1,2017-3-17,1,1,0
"This camera is awesome.  We got it for my son who was turning eight.  The picture is so great.  I am really impressed with the crispness and color of it.  The sound is really quiet when you record.  That was a little bummer, but the picture and easiness of the camera makes up for it.  You have to look up the Owners Manual with the QR code that they put in the box.  It is pretty easy to use.  There were just a few things that we didn't know what to do when figuring out the set up but with some trial and error we have figured out almost everything.  I am really happy with this purchase and my son LOVES it.  And the price is really great too!",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
Fantastic little video camera! Impressed with how many useful accessories are included for free like an extra battery with charging dock that will charge both batteries at the same time!

"As someone just starting to take action photography this camera has great quality video and photos.  I  didn't want to spend a lot, so when I saw the price point for this camera ordered it right away.  I want to capture the summer with my kids, and this is the camera for it.  The writs shutter button works great.  I am looking forward to taking it on the bike trails and kayak with my boys.I was also able to download the pictures and video to my computer, but I have not tried the app yet.",5,1,2018-5-28,1,0,0
"I purchased one of these for myself and another for my nephew during Christmas. I love the portability and I carry it on runs. I recommend it for hiking, running, cycling and other outdoor sports.

I bought this anticipating my upcoming trip to Tahiti hoping to take some amazing underwater pictures as one of my fellow sailors did with this camera on a recent trip. But unfortunately my Tahiti trip was a victim of the virus. So I mounted the camera on my bike and am  enjoying the videos I am coming up with on my bike adventures. I have been posting them on Facebook so my friends are enjoying them too. The only mishap was that the camera fell out of the holder on one of my trips but I learned that you have to be sure you snap it in firmly. The attachments are great and give you lots of options.,5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"This camera is so amazing, and I only just received it. I can't wait to do more filming and test out the sharing abilities. Really awesome quality and easy to use.

So far, I have loved using this product.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"Great camera !! I needed a underwater camera for my Mexico vacation. This camera was more than what I expected for the price. The underwater case it came with worked ! The pictures and videos came out very clear. I took it with me snorkeling, swimming and at the beach. Transferring pictures and videos to my Phone and tablet was easy! It also comes with 2 batteries which def came in handy.Here are some pictures I took while snorkeling.",5,1,2017-9-6,1,2,1
I love this camera because it is super small and easy to fit in your pocket. We take it everywhere on vacation. It goes underwater and you can film yourself swimming or snorkeling. Great price and great quality. You can put it on your phone through the app and watch the videos.,5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,1
"Purchased the Akaso EK7000 4K Wifi for my kids to record outdoor activities (biking, kayaking, hiking, swimming and such this summer).  Really impressed with image quality and overall video performance.  For the price you can not beat it.  Easy to use and operate.  My kids love the wrist remote and all the attachments that came with it.  Would have given it a 5 star but my kids use Chromebooks and suggested apps do not run on it so file transfer is a bit of a mess for them since the WiFi does not work with it.  I have to either go to my phone or my laptop.  Of course you can always use the USB charging cord direct and that seems to work as well.  Overall the unit works great.",4,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Tough to beat for $50. Overall great value. Performance is better than expected. I can see why it's such a popular model on Amazon.

But as entry level, this is super.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
I must admit that I was hesitant on buying this. I mean the price this camera is at and the fact that its a sport camera? Come on who wouldnt lol. But when you look at a gopro and this I would choose this. With it being a sport camera 'it will eventually end up broken with that being said this camera is just as sturdy as a gopro with the bonus of having better color and just all around better picture as well. If you're looking for a great camera at an affordable price buy this one. Im going to buy a couple more that way I have extra. If you've had a gopro keep all of your accessories like the mounts and stuff because this one is compatible with them.,5,1,2017-2-28,1,1,0
So far so good haven't tested it under water yet. Kids seem to love it so far battery's don't last to long but nice you get 2 of them to switch out. Would be nice to get a printed instruction booklet for it but you can find it online. Seems to get a little warm but hopefully that won't be a problem when I test it out more I'll update my review 🙂,5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I purchased this back in March or early April to use whilst I am away this Autumn. Unfortunately, I didn't open it or play with it until I went away but so far I cannot see how anyone can rate this camera. I cannot get videos to record longer than a few seconds, if I manage to get them to record at all. Then once they automatically finish I have to switch off the camera to enable a new function or to start another video recording. If anyone can help me, I'd appreciate a solution. Currently annoyed I didn't just spend the money on a GoPro, but thought I had researched thoroughly.",1,1,2017-9-7,1,3,0
So far it's a pretty good little camera. It has lots of different mounts so you can use it a bunch of different ways. So far I've only used it around the house but looking forward to using it on my kayak and for underwater photos on my next vacation! It was a little hard to figure out at first as it didn't come with anything but a quick start guide but once I was able to download the manual it was pretty easy to figure out.,4,1,2020-5-29,1,0,1
I like how this action camera comes with extra mounts and remote control. The picture quality is very good. Tested some mounts and finally figured out how to mount it on a selfie stick. This will come in handy when we are in motion. Also the waterproof case can also be mounted on a selfie stick which is very cool. Highly recommended.,5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"For how cheap it is, it does it’s job very well. I use it to capture my motorcycle rides. Video is high quality but the photos are not that great. Wouldn’t use it to make high quality youtube videos but nice for capturing videos for safety and insurance reasons. For some reason the video will stop recording after 25 minutes tho. I fixed it by changing the settings to have 10 min loops. Would recommend.",4,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
Bought this camera to video fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The video quality is ok but the audio sucks. I didn't expect it to be all that great with the  waterproof case on but even when it is not in the housing it doesn't pick up audio very well. The wi-fi function works great as well as the remote that came with the camera. It's an ok camera if you don't care about the audio.,3,1,2017-11-27,1,1,0
"Purchased this camera as a low price option to using a Go-Pro. Currently have Go-Pro Hero-3, used primarily as a bike camera recording daily training rides. The GO-Pro batteries were losing charge and the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera looked like a good, inexpensive alternative. I've now used this camera for several weeks and like it very much. The batteries last twice as long as the GO-Pro batteries (using on continuous record), the view screen is clear, two batteries are nice, and the double battery charger is convenient. Additionally it fits into the GO-Pro mounts.A slight negative is the absence of front and back recording indicators, (there is only one on the top of the camera), and the signal beeps are too soft so we don't hear them while riding. Given the very favorable price these drawbacks are minor and I can easily recommend this camera.",4,1,2018-10-27,1,0,0
"My wife got this for me for Christmas instead of the GoPro I had on my list.  I have to admit, I had never heard of Akaso before this, but my wife did a great job with her research.  You CANNOT get a better camera for the price.  Set up was incredibly easy and the 4K UHD video capture is phenomenal.  I used it for the first time out on the ski hill and it was so so easy to operate.  There is an included wrist remote control, but I downloaded the EZ iCam app for my iPhone and found this to be a better option seeing as I could watch the playback right then and there after I was done recording.I would have been fine with just the camera for the price that was paid, but Akaso goes and throws all the accessories in when you buy the camera; extra battery included!  The battery along with the water proof case and array of mounts is a much appreciated value.",4,1,2017-1-31,1,1,0
"I purchased this for a ski trip that I just returned from. When the package first arrived, I plugged it in, waited for it to fully charge, and turned it on. It appeared to work. But then when it came time to use it on the slopes, I realize that the product DID NOT WORK AT ALL when it was not plugged directly into a power outlet, which obviously defeats the purpose of a 'Sports Action Camera.' I therefore missed out on a lot of good footage during my ski trip. I was pretty bummed about that. Take my advice. Just get a GoPro. It's worth the extra money and you'll be supporting a US company that doesn't just make cheap knock offs of other's innovations.",1,1,2018-3-8,1,1,0

I've watched the videos that he's made with this camera and I'm amazed at how clear and steady the camera is. The only thing that might make this better is possibly a better mic, the sound isn't as great as the picture. Overall, my son says, and I agree, this is an awesome camera.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
This is a great little video camera. Takes pictures too. Use this while doing projects or doing some activity and it works great. comes with two batteries which is really nice as for long projects I usually have to replace the battery at least once. For long recording (greater than 1 hour) the gadget gets pretty hot but I haven't noticed that being an issue with the quality of image or video. It has a nice view so it gets a lot in the image. I've used this for 3 different video projects so far and am happy with the purchase.,4,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"Never had an action type cam before and didn't want to sink the $$ into a GoPro, yet. Does what it's supposed to do. Takes nice pictures, very decent video at 30P; I haven't tried 60P yet but will next week for my wife's charity bike ride and will report back. Plenty of doodads and gadgets come with it, and the extra battery is nice. Remote works perfectly.Not so perfect: the WiFi. Added the app [with it's 1-star rating on Apple AppStore], fired up the Wifi on the camera, connected on my 4S phone without a problem. Live view with a little lag, pretty cool. But hit record and what's going on? Is it recording? All functions on the app not responsive; couldn't stop recording. Couldn't shut off the camera - camera totally locked up. Had to remove the battery to get the camera restarted. Tried this 3 or 4 times with IOS devices near the camera. Did not try photo shooting, just video.",4,1,2017-1-31,1,1,0

This means I down have anything to do in post-production. Saves me hours of frustrating editing with expensive software. Its just download straight to internet media so all can see in minutes.

I guess the only downside is this doesn’t come with a SD card, but I needed additional cards anyway so it’s not that big of a deal.  Great camera, awesome picture quality, reasonable price!

"I was wanting to buy a action camera for my son to use at the beach this year for vacation, but couldn't justify the gopro price. So I saw this camera and read the reviews and watched youtube videos on it and decided to give it a try. It was priced in a range I could afford. I have used a gropro before and knew the quality video it produced. The camera was ready to go out of the box minus a micro sd, I walked around outside the house and shot a test video. The led screen on the back makes it easy to see what you are filming. I came in hooked up the transfer cable  and was amazed at the quality of video this thing can record. Is it as good as a top of the line gopro? probably not, but for the price you cant go wrong with this camera.  So after the test run I tried the include remote out and it works great starting and stopping the recording from a distance. I tested the waterproof case without the camera in it first. It was good to go no leaks. The real test will be when we hit the beach in a few weeks, if anything happens I will update review.",5,1,2017-8-10,1,1,0

But the camera is great and the amount of accessories it comes with are amazing.  You also cannot beat the quality you get for this price! Definitely worth getting before you break the bank on a g0-pro.,4,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
I am a virtual science teacher and I plan on using the camera to do experiments and take my kids on virtual field trips. I let my 11-year-old test drive for this and it was awesome. It works great with the head straps or with chest straps that you can buy separately as part of an accessory package.  It's so lightweight and tiny and it has a housing that is practically indestructible and waterproof. Love it!,5,1,2017-8-20,1,1,0
I bought this for my 10 year old son as gift for our trip to Mexico. It definitely did not disappoint! Picture/sound/color quality all comparable to our GoPro. We were able to share attachments between the two devices as well.,5,1,2020-8-20,1,1,0
"I bought this camera for my daughter so she could use it at camp. Easy to use, very compact. My 10 year old was able to master the features within minutes and took great pictures and videos. The waterproof case made it worry free for us and for her since it rained quite a bit when she was at camp. We plan on using it underwater on our next vacation. The only thing that could have been better was that there was no user manual in the box. However, I was easily able to download it from their website so no real issue there. Would recommend this camera for anyone looking for an action camera at a cheap price.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I've used this for recording video while flying and am amazed at its performance and clarity. Crisp and smooth video, good battery life, robust camera - wish I'd bought it a long time ago!Can't go wrong with this one. I'll be buying more for more perspectives. :)",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"My parents got me this camera for my 12th birthday. I love this so much. the picture quality is very good. it comes with a ton of accessories like a bike mount and helmet mount, there are a ton more but those are the main ones. it comes with a waterproof and shatterproof case. It is also very light weight. This is a great product for the price.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more.",3,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"I purchased this action camera with vacation, but before even going on vacation I am seeing the worth of this camera. Is the video quality as good as a GoPro? No, but for the price point and someone that is not a youtuber, its fantastic! Even just for taking pictures in the pool with the kids its great since I don't have to worry about it getting wet. I have just been playing around with it filming everything I can thing of. It also works for a web cam on the computer if you needed as well. I can't wait to go on vacations and capture memories with my girls hiking and horseback riding!",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"I haven't been able to take the camera out in the wild yet, but playing around with it in the house, it seems to be everything the descriptions said.  The only complaints that keep it from five-star so far, are the scanty instructions, even the downloaded PDF, and the lack of ability to download picture content directly to a PC via USB.  And although there are lots of attachments, need better instructions on how to use them.",4,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
This is a great camera.  We were in the market for a GoPro for our snowboarding trips and saw this deal yesterday and decided it was worth trying out for only $45.  It just arrived today and we are really happy we decided to order it.  The picture quality is great and it's super easy to use and it comes with a ton of accessories.  Haven't had the chance to test out the battery life but it comes with 2 batteries so no concerns there. You can't beat this value.,5,1,2019-10-7,1,1,0
"I do a lot of road & Mountain Biking along with kayaking. I use my phone camera a lot, though during MB riding its iffy.  This cam works great, getting more and more use to it.  have connected app to my phone, which I like. Will be taking a 335 mile MB trip this fall, and hope this works as good as it has been.  Only issue had I known more, I would have bought more attachments, like using this in my truck, chest harness for kayaking.. It did come with a handlebar mount for my bikes..  This is a great product for the money, as I was concern at first what the quality would be, though so far I am 100% satisfied..",4,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"I had been wanting an action camera for over a year. After our trip to Costa Rica I knew I should get one. I didn't want to invest tons of money on a GoPro incase I never used it. So I chose this Akaso camera. For the price is does its job, but I feel like all my photos are the wrong color. They almost seem more warm/reddish. For that reason I have not used it much. But maybe it will be a good camera for underwater. If anything my kids enjoy using it.",4,1,2018-3-28,1,0,0
This product is amazing. It has great lighting And the waterproof casing kept it dry. 10/10 would recommend to a friend if I need a new go pro I will for sure buy this product again it's light so you won't get the tired out feeling you get from your phone. It's super cool to because you can use a remote to take a picture or start a video with it. Can't wait to film videos with it for YouTube it was a little too wet for it today.,5,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"Ordered back in May 2020 for a gift to my 8 year old grandson. After some getting use to it, he was off and running..skateboarding, in the pool hiking trails and on his bike. Make sure you buy a large Micro SD card. It will get used!!  Made it through the summer with no problems well built!  8 year old approved!",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"You are getting what you are paying for , 2 stars because 85$ is really cheap for what specifications say, but to be honest 4k looks like 720p, its a piece of cra* who do i want to lie, dont buy this unless you really dont care about how the pictures or videos are going to be, it lagged the first day for nothing it freezes for someone who has patience is good, definitly not for me, i bought it to save the money difference between the go pro 5, returned it the same day , i guess im paying 400$ for the go pro 5",2,1,2016-12-14,1,1,0
Great little camera. Will be using it to film hunts. The 4k resolution is a bit lower FPS when watching it back than I'd like it to be but I find that 2.7k is a fantastic quality and playback. For the money you really can't beat it. The wrist remote is a very nice feature. I plan to do a lot videoing with this!,5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
I love the price and all of the accessories that come with this perf camera. It has great quality videos and is reasonable.  The only problem is that 56 GB is the highest micro SD card that works well with this camera but they should be enough.Love it will but it as a gift and would get another one if I lost this one.,5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I bought this as a present for my son, who loves to do mountain biking, and he always wanted to capture his adventures on the bike. He got really excited, at first it was complicated to watch the videos until we figure it out that we need it to download it from the memory to the computer, so we bought an adapter to do it directly instead of two steps. Very recommendable, specially for teenagers who are a little clumsy with pricey stuff, and this camera is very sturdy. Pricewise it is very good for the quality you get. My nephew got the same one after watching my son's videos.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"This camera and included hardware are a great way to get started making videos of your adventures. The various mounts provide many different options. Handlebars, helmet, tripod, clip to your jacket, pole, and underwater.Comes with a remote to take those drive by videos or stills.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Awesome camera to record our next vacation.I was looking for an excellent camera for this vacation, I checked the specifications on the Internet, I watched videos on YouTube to compare and see which one would be the best option, when I saw all the qualities of this camera I was convinced, I am a systems engineer and I can say that this Camera is amazing since it lends itself to the editing of photos and video in good quality.",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I would give this a 5 star but I'm reviewing this product with the mindset of everyone buying this. Everything is awesome except the sound, the sound quality is so low and hard to hear in and out of the case. Now this product for me is  a 5 star because all I want is the video and pictures I create my own videos and always put music over my sound so this product is perfect for me. But if you're a YouTuber or want this for sound I would say stay this may not be the product for you.",4,1,2017-9-18,1,1,0
For the money it really is a good deal. What I don’t like is the video Is .mov format. IF you are wanting to do any editing you will have to convert the file or find video editing software that recognizes the .mov format. It’s easy to use. Setup is pretty straight forward. I’d pick up an external mic or use something else to record sound. The battery life could be better but at least it comes with 2 batteries.,4,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"This is a great camera for the price.  We do atv riding and this camera works perfectly.  We have to other 2 other 4K HD mini cams and they are no where near the quality of this one.  Picture in the video is bright and clear.  No edge blurring at all when running at speed thru trails with brush and trees near the trail side.  Waterproof case is very tight, and brings peace of mind that the camera is safe.  Sound does pick up thru the waterproof case.  We have it mounted on a chin mount and it had no problem picking up the wearers voice.  I will be buying a second one for our next trip.  Its also a plus that it comes with a mini charger and has 2 batteries.  We are able to charge on the trail should we need to,  The batteries also seem to have a pretty long life.  Much better than the last camera I had.",5,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0
Well for 50 dollars it good. Just not for Running or jogging or probably riding bike because the video ain't stable. But they do have software u can make stable more. But fishing I can't complaint. battery life isnt the best so it best u use battery bank.,4,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"First I have to start with I bought the wrong action camera, I meant to buy the one with image stabilization but by accident got the $20 chapter one with out it. Aside for the ""meh"" battery life (good thing they sent 2) and the fact that the native app kinda suck, not the best. I hope it can support multiple Cam. I like the video recording. I know it's not the best high end action camera but I love I can live stream, use it as dash cam, webcam. I definitely going to get the next model up so I can record on the trails.",4,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
I'm pleased with the camera overall and the image quality is good. I received new batteries from the seller and they are SO much better than the ones that came with the camera originally. I'm testing one now and I have been recording for 45 minutes and the battery indicator shows a half-full battery. I can now use my camera!,4,1,2019-1-27,1,1,0
"Build quality of the camera feels good.  Nice and ruberized texture, buttons feel nice and it looks good in black.  Picture quality at 1080/60 is smooth and impressive out of the box.  2.7k and 4k are a stretch for this little guy but it works...  Sometimes.And there's the catch. This camera crashes once just about every time you take it out on an adventure.  The app that goes with it crashes even more works about 65% of the time.  So there is the gamble, video quality, compatability w/gp, and price point are all really good!  But reliability is only 80-90% which in the action packed world that kinda sucks sometimes.",3,1,2016-12-27,1,1,0
"Was received earlier than promised, packaged to prevent damage.Bought this to use in the water primarily.  The camera, case work as expected.  The remote stopped as soon as wet.  After the wet vacation, I wanted to mount in the truck.  Can't seem to find the setting to keep the camera active longer than a few minutes.  I guess I could look in the book, but working through the limited buttons is tiresome.  There are a lot of attachments which is a bargain.",3,1,2017-4-5,1,2,0
"This camera was everything I was hoping for and so much more! It came with a ton of accessories! Comes with batteries. It does not include the micro sd card, so heads up when purchasing. It has everything you need to first get started besides that! Each battery lasts about 2hrs of straight recording. Over all extremely happy with my purchase and the quality of the product for what I paid.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,1

With the upside down feature I'm able to hang one camera for a top view and it's really easy to do.  Although recording concerts was the main reason for my purchase, I've used these gems to record family gatherings, and now that we can't gather, my solo bike rides through the neighborhood.  Amazing cameras and at such a low price, I'll be using my EK7000 action cameras for many yeas to come.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"This is the BEST Camera that I have found any where.  I have several of these cameras that I like to use while Fishing in Canada.  It is small and the easiest that I have found to use.  I take a lot of group shots while in Canada with my Fishing group.  I usually make a DVD of our trips and give everyone a copy. So is you are looking for a small, light weight waterproof camera you have found a great one here. I strongly recommend this Camera.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,1
"Excellent camera. I haven't used the remote yet so I can't speak to that but the camera works great. I've used it mostly for mountain biking and purchased an optional chest strap. Several accessories do come with the camera so depending on your intended use plan on getting on of the many GoPro compatible kits. Battery life isn't great (~60 mins per battery and you get 2) and the camera just turns off when the battery is about to die. There's no warning beep or light or anything like that. Documentation is also a little on the slim side. There's several pages in English that cover the features but not in depth. Not a huge issue as the interface is simple and easy to use once you play with it. I also have not tried out the 4K mode yet. Fort most action sports 1080p at 60 FPS is fine and for biking provides smooth video. Overall a solid camera, very affordable, and functions well. For the price you can't beat it!",4,1,2017-2-25,1,2,0
"So far so good,It takes great videos and proabably pictures as well, but my issue is im not able to download the pictures from the app for some reason, they all say complete but they arent on my phone.  Most likely its a user error and not the product.  I plan on taking it on vacation here soon and really testing it. I will update my review if anything changes",4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
First action camera. Worth the money. Picture and video quality seems good. No complaints. 1/19/20- after purchasing I gave a review. Submitted the review (per request) to Akaso. Was sent an ungodly amount of accessories!!! Make sure to do this when purchasing. 👍🏻,4,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"First, let me just say I am a casual user and don't write reviews of products for a living.  If I like something / not like something, I will say so.I got the product and have been playing around with it most of the day.  The bought this for one purpose and that is for capturing videos of my flying  RC planes and helicopters. The stuff I read about making videos recommended no to shoot in 4k but to shoot 1080 at 60fps.  It makes editing easier. The iSMART DV app works on my  Acer tablet (4.4.2)  and phone (5.1).  No problems connecting to the camera and using it to preview the field of view.  I'm impressed with the quality of the videos and very happy with the purchase.  I'm sure there are better cameras out there, but I do have a budget to need to consider.",5,1,2017-3-17,1,1,0
"Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k.",2,1,2018-4-17,1,4,0
"The picture and video clarity on this camera is great, the microphone is pretty low quality and low volume with volume adjustment from 1-3. I was hoping it would be louder but you could always purchase an external mic. The camera does what we need it to, my boys can mount it to their bikes, helmets, fishing rods, etc. It comes with multiple attachment mounts.  The settings buttons aren't real user friendly and takes some getting used to as far as toggling between options and viewing pictures or video on camera. Overall a decent cheap alternative to a Gopro.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
We absolutely love this camera. It was an early Christmas gift for my husband so he could film all of our holiday happenings. So easy to use right out of the box and with not much experience using other types of video cameras and so many accessories that it comes with. The small size is great for traveling and the picture is amazing. It works with GoPro mounts which is a huge plus. We have two very active boys and this is easy to use on the go and be able to keep up with them. I like the feature of being able to download an app to control the camera and view the live video on my phone.,5,1,2017-1-5,1,1,0
"The camera is excellent, the materials are of good quality and comes well protected, also has all the necessary accessories for a lot of situations. The one that comes with two batteries makes it extremely profitable. In terms of its use, you connect it with your smartphone and you can see in real time what you are going to start capturing.",5,1,2018-8-31,1,1,1
Just opened my package and am a bit overwhelmed with all the mount options. Everything appears to be well made and I am excited to use it on my vacation. I wish the manual went a bit more in depth and showed images of each mount in use so I know which one to use where. Not included in the manual are nylon clasping straps as well as Velcro straps. The zip ties and a cable fastener are shown in the manual but no description of how to use them. I am giving this a 4/5 star because everything (and more) arrived in the package but there is little instruction on where/how to use them.,4,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"I picked up this action cam for a youth hockey trip to Quebec in early 2020. I brought it everywhere we went, including: restaurants/bars, sledding/skiing, sightseeing, hockey rinks. I would bring a spare battery with me for the day, and most of the time I was fine with battery time. I noticed it seemed to drain faster when we were out on the mountain skiing/sledding, but I was also recording a lot of longer runs. I was able to easily pull the videos/images off after the trip and save them to my computer. I'm happy with the purchase and look forward to using more of the accessories in the summer months.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
I bought this to use in Hawaii and downloaded the app. It only records when the app is open. I've had so many issues with it. I press record only to get back home and discover nothing recorded. I absolutely hate this device and the app is even worse.,1,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"We purchased this camera for our 8 year old for his birthday.  He wanted a go-pro but we figured a cheaper alternative would be best since he is a beginner and not necessarily responsible enough yet for the real-deal.  I was very pleased to see all of the great accessories that this camera came with, including mounts for his bike, helmet, etc. and the wrist remote.  We downloaded the icam app and he thinks it is really cool how he can see what he is recording by way of the iPad screen.  I like how we can easily download videos to his device wirelessly without having to remove the memory card or use my computer.  The only thing I am not 100% crazy about is the lack of a case that is NOT waterproof.  The nature of a waterproof case is that everything is completely enclosed and I feel like it causes the sound to be muffled.  However, we don't want him using the camera without any case to protect it and as far as I can tell, the cases available for this camera are all waterproof (unlike the go-pro, which don't look to be compatible due to the buttons and such being placed differently).  My son is over the moon for this camera and we plan to upgrade to a go pro after he proves himself responsible with this one for a while.",5,1,2017-1-22,1,1,0
"This is my first camera like this and it's great!! Good picture and video quality, focuses well and the case and gear that comes with it are in excellent condition. None of my order was scratched up or beaten. I'm not one to buy expensive things so if you're looking for a good on-you travel camera that won't cost a pretty penny then I recommend this one!! Also, I love that this camera comes with the wrist ""watch"". It's easy to use especially if you're not wanting to touch the camera, easy pic or video all on your wrist. The straps that came with it were crazy long but you can easily cut it off to whatever length you want. Also comes with a spare for it.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,1
So far GREAT!.  I took pictures and video around the house to check and really like the quality.  For a little camera it does a very good job.  The fact that it comes all the accessories and two batteries is just icing on the cake.  I'll be taking this on vacation in a couple weeks and look forward to using it for video and wide angle landscape photos.  The remote control will work to capture pictures of me and the wife.  I can actually be in the picture instead of behind the camera.,5,1,2018-4-1,1,0,1

"I was skeptical of how good the quality would be with this camera but I didn't want to spend the money on the GP brand. It's going on my motorcycle after all. I'd be a bit disappointing if it fell off or got hit by a rock/bird or who knows what else.To my amazement the video quality is great at 1080P which is all I need. The audio is a bit muffled but that's with the waterproof case on. As far as underwater performance goes, I couldn't be happier with that also. I took the camera to a water park and my kids loved filming themselves going down the slides and attaching to their snorkeling masks which have a mount. Truly waterproof!The software works great on my Galaxy S7, all of the different accessories serve their purpose and the remote is a nice addition.",5,1,2017-8-14,1,1,0
Camera freezes 3 seconds into recording 4k video and never recovers without holding the power button or removing the battery to force shutdown.  The image quality is horrific (and for this price I didn't expect it to be very good).  I really don't understand how this got positive reviews.  There is a lot of horizontal tearing in videos when panning or watching fast-moving objects.  The app and wifi functionality also seem to crash a lot.This is one of the really rare cases where I buy a well-reviewed item on Amazon and it turns out to be trash.  oh well,1,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I use this for autocross--- so it is in an ""interesting"" environment and I was looking at others, including GoPro, but I just can't seem to justify the price. So with it showing up in an Amazon search for action cams, I added to my list and had to think about it. That lasted a few days and I ordered one. It came nicely packaged and so on...had one snafu with the case in which Akaso promptly shipped me out a new one and I had it in a couple of days...nice and responsive...thank you!Performance wise, I first tried the 4k setting and the frame rate is too slow for me, so I went for 1080p which looks great at 60fps, the video feed is smooth. The sound is muffled as I used the waterproof case but considering it was in a sealed case--- it sounded pretty good. The remote works well and overall I am very pleased with the camera. The only thing I wish it did was have the red light on the face of it versus the top... would be easier for me to see it when I use the remote to start and stop it--- and with that the light is slow to blink/ respond on the camera to my remote control inputs....but...for the price and how it has worked for me--- it is something I will adjust to without issue.",5,1,2017-10-3,1,5,0
"Wow what a disappointment! This camera, while maybe has the pixel quantities to be 4k or 1080p, does not have the lens or ISP quality to produce images anywhere near that resolution.  I would say maybe 720p is the photo and video quality you're getting.Product was received with a cracked housing, and the lens got foggy after use in scuba diving. The remote is utterly useless and doesn't work- rather it got in the way rather than helping.  Returned product and going to buy a GoPro instead. Don't waste your time unless you want a 720p camera.",2,1,2017-5-7,1,1,0
This is great camera for the price and the remote just tops It Off this one is way better than all the others I seen I had a little trouble at first with the interface and at first thought that the case front lens was damaged once I contacted them after the follow up email they sent me a swift response telling me to just remove the protective film over the lens that I didn't even notice was there thank God it was. while giving me awesome instructions on how to work the interface for a certain function I really needed. Overall I am super happy with this purchase you can't beat the price and the quality is way better than expected the remote control just tops It Off even though you can use the Wi-Fi option and use your phone as a controller also but the app could still use a little work on certain versions of Android the customer service was great and willing to fix the problem instantly with no questions about who was in the wrong which is very rare these days. The 4 k was amazing as the 1080 wide lense I mostly got this to record some of my first music videos for my band and was not disappointed!,5,1,2016-10-16,1,0,0
"I was looking to own a high end action camera like those go-pro kinds. So I thought lets get used to these by starting low. I got a deal on ""AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera"" which was very reasonable. I read few reviews and bought and was not expecting much.  The package arrived nicely packed.I was totally surprised by the output this camera produces. I compared it with one of my friends high end action camera and we didn't find differences.",5,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"I started snowboarding this year and needed a camera to review my riding skills. Go Pro is too expensive and I didn't want to loose it since I fall pretty often. This camera is a great substitute. The price is perfect for the quality of video and sound. Although the color is not as vibrant as I wish for it to be. It comes with a lot of different stands to use during different activities. I love to travel as well, so I think it will be very useful and easy to carry around with me. Overall, this is a great buy for the price.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

"I just received my EK7000 and I really like it. For everything you get as well as the quality of the camera, it is very much worth the cheap price point. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on an action camera because I would be using it in harsh environments where there is a lot of dust, noise, static electricity, etc. The camera is working great. The only problem I've had with it is that I cant sync it with my iPhone 6. Other than that, great camera, great price.",4,1,2017-1-9,1,5,0
I've just started using this camera as a replacement for my older GoPro cameras.  I love the amount of accessory mounts that come included in the package.  The image quality is excellent and rivals the much more expensive GoPro's.  Having a second battery standard with the camera is a plus.  It is super easy to setup and use.  my favorite feature is the remote control that allows you to take pictures and video from the press of a button. I will probably buy one or two more shortly.,5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"I just received this camera and tried it out with our dog on the hiking trails.  It is a great value for the price.  The image is crystal clear and the sound is really good.  There is a little bumpiness, but I was running after our dog and holding the camera by hand.  I hope it will be better stabilized once it is locked into place with headgear or on abike.  The camera is easy to figure out how to work, just a few simple buttons.  The wrist remote is super convenient.  Its small and fits nicely into a small bag.This is a great action camera for the active person who wants video and pictures on the go!",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
This is my first action cam and am not upset with my purchase.  At this price point you get several attachments and can pretty much mount it anywhere you would like.  It has 2 batteries and each last around 90 or so minutes for me.  I like filming in the 1080p 60fps or 30fps the best.  Another nice feature is this has a remote to start and stop video or to take pictures with.If you are looking for a camera that will stabilize this is not the model to go with there is no stabilization and probably my only regret.  If you have a gimbal or purchase one would be perfect setup.,5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
This was a gift for my grandson. He is enjoying it but the down button on the side of the camera is stuck. Working with manufacturer on this. According to claim it should be covered.  That’s only reason for three stars.  Great price compared to go pro with same functions.,3,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I was looking at the usual competition and I am SO glad I tried this one out first. The transition using the remote is amazing - just a quick click switches you from video to camera and back, no futzing around on the actual camera avoiding need to adjust angles, or fat thumbs in your image :p  The fish-eye lens covers also a great span of scenery as you can see, without too much curve, just a cool enough effect. Go Get It!",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,1
"It is wonderful if you are going on vacation because it is very small and it is waterproof. We found a lot of wonderful videos underwater and above it. My only drape comes with the picture quality is good but not great, video quality is very good though.

"I bought this camera for my wife and I to take on our Honeymoon to Hawaii. I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on a GoPro so judging by the amount of positive reviews, and good price, I went with this camera. We were very impressed with the video quality, and while the still images are not the highest quality, overall for a $43 camera I cannot complain at all. I shot in 1080P the entire time and had great video quality. The only complaint I do have, is that the time stamp resets to 2018 every time you change the battery, so I just turned it off.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,1
"i was looking for something to use on my motorcycle when I take my trips.  I didn't want to spend the $$ for a go pro, I'm not that savvy, or plan on using it THAT much to invest too much into it.  I played with it the first day and it's cool!!  granted, I had to watch a you tube to figure out some of the things (again, not tech savvy).  I'm waiting on an accessory kit that I ordered also so that I can just harness it to myself.  I'm not too keen on attaching it to my helmet as of yet, but who knows, maybe in time I will be!  I used it this weekend when I went for a ride and other than I need to mount it to a better location, it was awesome.  we also have horses, so it will be neat for trail rides as well.  and, I always wonder where the dogs go - now, I just may find out!!  for the cost, I don't think it can be beat.  I'm very pleased with it!",5,1,2018-9-4,1,0,0

I bought 2 units Akaso EK 7000 and I like love it so much.. the Wi-Fi connection on my phone and the remote control are absolutely flawless. for the price you can't go wrong the best deal so far. It comes with a LCD screen at the back of the camera... and tons of accessories that you would normally buy separate don't forget to batteries included.. The list could go on and on I would recommend this to anyone who has limited budget but want a great performance..,5,1,2017-1-16,1,1,0

The sound isnt there but thats fine. it doesnt have the full fisheye view of a GoPro, but it does have a good field of view. overall its a good camera...for a 9yo.

It's a great camera and is just as good as or better than my old Go-Pro.  For my needs, it's  everything the Go-Pro was and much more when you look at all the accessories included in the package that arrived from Amazon.  I added up all the similar accessories & camera from Go-Pro  and they came to almost  7 times more cost than what I got in the AKASO EK 7000 kit.

"I've been very happy with this product. It's as close as you could possibly get to a GoPro Hero, without buying a GoPro price. It should be noted that the higher resolution you record at, you lose out on framerate. 4K resolution goes down to 24fps or so.I still like it with that compromise, and I believe there's a similar problem on a GoPro.",5,1,2018-3-7,1,0,0
"For the price point, it’s a great camera. Used it while scuba diving multiple times (60ft depth), cliff jumping, snorkeling and shark cage diving in South Africa. Results were always satisfactory, very close to that of a GoPro for a fraction of the cost.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"Unit worked great! I have never owned a GoPro unit before, and I'm sure that the GoPro may have better resolution, but for the price and what I got from this unit on vacation, I am thoroughly impressed and happy about my purchase. Videos came out great at 1080p, and pictures were awesome at 12mp. Underwater footage was awesome and took some great pics and videos there too. At a third of the cost of other brands, I would definitely buy this again.I did buy some additional accessorizes for my trip like a bobber and mount for the car. Great value and great product!",5,1,2017-4-4,1,1,0
This was a good camera to record riding on my motorcycle. It did great for one trip until the adhesive came off and blew the camera away. It was strong enough to stick to my helmet but not to the mount apparently. I also broke one of the clips when disconnecting it.,4,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
Good little camera for the price.  I mean little it is so small its great.  Very light.  Waterproof case is great.  I bought it for my son who is going on a cruise.  It is easy to use and at that price I won't be as upset when he breaks or loses it on his trip.  It came with tons of accessories.  Wish it came with a micro as card also though as it does not.  So far the quality is fine.  I dont have another camera of this type to compare it with.  Works great for what I needed.,4,1,2018-2-4,1,0,0
"We bought this camera for out trip to Playa Del Carmen ,MX. To tell you the truth we purchased it from both the reviews and price and it was well worth the cost. Unfortunately we didnt use it as often as we would have liked, not because of quality, but because I forgot to take it out on occasions, it worked very well. We used it in the rivers of Xcaret and at the beach. It holds up extremely well while being submerged. The picture quality didnt drop at all. I really liked the fact that it comes with a wristband that you can use to take pics. So if youre looking for a good but price worthy camera this is the one for you.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
Amazing product for the broke guy trying to go pro! I have always wanted to get amazing shots riding the motorcycle right down to scuba diving but could not afford to.....GoPro.

This is an amazing compact sports camera right up there with the overpriced GO Pro.  I love all the accessories that come with this camera as well of the fact that it has a water proof case that is good up tho 100 ft.  the WI-fi enabled feature is great as well.  I bought this camera to go with my Akaso v50 and in all honesty i think it stands up right next to it.

If you want it in a case and still be able to attach it to the various mounts they give you you have to put the camera in the open framed case.

In total with a memory card it was 1/3 or less than the cost of the famous brand's camera alone.

The color and contrast was superior, in tough theatrical lighting conditions. However, it has much less configurability than the other - no ability to set picture settings the way other cameras can. The menu is shorter and simpler. The audio was also much more muffled sounding.Overall, it was great image quality, poor sound quality, and since I have other sound recording gear, I'll probably get a couple more of these thanks to the great video in dark, spotlighted conditions.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

I've enjoyed that there is a screen flipping option so I don't have to fight with the way I hold the camera as well. I haven't experimented with it underwater yet, but I intend to test the case a few times before filming under water as it can be finicky to get to seat fully. I would say it is a solid buy if you want to start making videos before committing to something pricier, or if you just want a cheap camera that you don't have to stress over.Pros:",5,1,2018-1-21,1,0,0
"This camera does make great videos, and is probably a nice alternative to a much more expensive GoPro.  It does come with lots of accessories.  The WiFi feature is nice, but just to be clear it's a way to view the video your camera is taking, on your iPhone.  It's not for transferring data.  The firmware, is very buggy, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.  A frustrating example: the camera will not put the correct date/time on the video file!  This is pretty important to me since I use Google Photo, which sorts by date.  Fix the firmware, Akaso, and I'll gladly update my review to a 5 start review.",3,1,2016-12-29,1,2,0
"I really like this little camera.  Ive been using it for a bit and it has exceeded my expectations.  I take it on fishing trips with me and it has survived well.  Also can be used as a web cam.  I am very happy with it.  Should be aware that if it is in the waterproof case, the audio recording is greatly diminished.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"This is a terrific camera. Picture quality is perfect, accessories fit perfectly, easy-to-use, easy setup. But two thumbs down for the ez icam download link. Scanned the box and downloaded easily, worked great for two days and an update download made it stop working. Reviews show everyone in the same boat, no phone access! So, unless you have a laptop or PC to connect to via USB, you are not going to be able to review or share online. Hoping they fix this problem. Again, camera itself is terrific!",4,1,2017-1-26,1,1,0
I purchased this for an upcoming snorkeling trip next week. I've never owned any action camera so for someone with zero experience its confusing to open the box with so many unlabeled parts. The only attachment I need is a wrist strap so I dont have to hold it while swimming and it doesnt come with that. A little cheat sheet to show what's what would be helpful. I'm never going to use those pieces if I have no idea what they are. I'll provide an updated review once I've used it underwater.Update: videos and pics came out great underwater. Easy to use. Better than I expected for the price.,4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

"I am impressed with this little action camera. I bought it as  complement to another brand name camera I have (for different angle shots. The picture quality is comparable with my more expensive device on the same settings. The major difference is the stabilization, which I already knew this camera did not have before my purchase.  I have tried for only one day, but overall I am very satisfied with the cost-benefit relation of this product.",5,1,2020-5-10,1,0,1
"We purchased this camera for our preteen son. It is his first underwater camera.The camera is small and light. It took me a little time to get used to hold it without touching the lens. It has wide screen, stable image. We wish it had zoom function, but that is available in pro. My son is a great swimmer, he took some amazing underwater photos with camera. He will be taking scuba lesson next month. He can’t wait to bring it to the open water scuba!",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"If you are looking for a cheap alternative to the GoPro. The AKASO EK7000 4K is the way to go. The camera it’s self takes some decent pictures for being a cheap camera. But right out of the box the water proof case it came with broke. The plastic that is attached to the clip and the part where the clip locks down broke. The adhesive on the sticker mounts came off right away as well, almost lost the camera in the river if it wasn’t for my cat like speed and reflexes!",3,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"I bought this camera for my son to film his snowboarding runs. Since he was 10 at the time, I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a camera that he would potentially misplace or be otherwise careless with. I had read other reviews of this camera and made the purchase based on those. This is truly an impressive value. Not only was it a simple camera to operate, the image quality is solid, it comes with every attachment you could think of, and the remote control was really handy when attached to the top of my son's helmet. I highly recommend this product!",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"Don't waste your money on the name brand, this works amazing, worth the money! My husband went onto youtube to see what he could do and found out it can connect to his phone via the phone app. You can view the images from the app. The pictures it takes are very clear and it works under water. If your hesitant youtube the product and you won't be mad you bought this.",5,1,2017-7-16,1,2,1
"Great for the money, that is if you don't want to have high quality video. It was rated very high on amazon, so I assumed the quality was going to be great. The video quality is worse that the original Go Pro. You get what you pay for. I'll still use it as a 5th camera when I need multiple angles, but it will never be a primary camera. I will be sticking to Go Pro.",2,1,2017-3-17,1,2,0
"I was impressed by what all was included in the box. Also it was easy to use and find instructions for the things I didn't know how to do. The camera functions well, I like the WiFi option, the software on my phone crashed a few times, but mostly when I tried to do more than one thing without waiting for the first thing to finish. Great product for the price, I am excited to get to try it on my vacation.",4,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"Great product! It works well and the mounts are nice. My husband really likes it for off-roading. This was a great value! The only downfall was the lack of instructions, but there are YouTube videos available that helped explain exactly how to use it and what attachment did what.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
Not sure if its the programming I am uploading the video with (final cut pro and I movie) but the picture is pixilated pretty bad. Uploaded as 1080p. Uploads perfect from my sony a6000. But this camera is 720 at best with proper lighting. At night its almost useless. Still giving it and overall 3 stars because its a good price. Recommend if you need one on a budget.,3,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"My husband and I both own a Jeep and go out most weekends on 4X4 adventures through mud, dirt and ponds. I bought this for him for his birthday as he loves to record our adventures and using our phones made it hard to enjoy the experiences. This product has an amazingly wide picture angle and the picture and video quality is top notch. We also love that a computer is not needed to be able to access the pictures or videos off the SIM card as everything is available on the app that you download on to your phone or tablet. I will be investing in one for my Jeep shortly. Thank you for such an amazing product.",5,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
So excited for this Akaso action camera!! I can’t wait to take it out when I kayak and video record in the car too! The shipment came right away and customer service for the camera wrote me back same day! I will write another review after taking the action camera to the indoor pool! So happy about this purchase!,5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"The picture is of a farmers market stand, looks pretty great. I just bought this action camera and after 2 days of experimenting with it I am very very impressed. For the price of 60$ you get a lot of bang for your buck. It comes with lots of cool mounts and I've already tested out one of them on my bike. It worked great and the video was fairly stable and recorded all the sounds, including my squeaky brakes. This camera is definitely worth the buy and I'm excited to put it to the real test this year in Costa Rica.",4,1,2019-8-18,1,0,1
This is a very user friendly and kid friendly device. We opted for this one over others because of the great reviews and we were not disappointed! The waterproof case has been great for swimming pool and outdoor adventures. The picture quality is amazing!,5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I was looking for alternatives to buying another GoPro when I came across this camera and figured for the price it wouldn’t hurt to try it out. I got this camera to use on my helmet during my track days and so far I am impressed, the video quality was very good and even when driving through the bumpy spots on the track the image was really stable. I can’t speak for the water resistance as haven’t used it in water but the case seems well built and doesn’t look like it would have any problem handing it. Overall for the price you can’t beat it and will be buying another one soon.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I have never owned a GoPro or other brand of ""action camera"" and I chose the AKASO EK7000 4K Sports Camera because at the time when I saw it was listed at a very reasonable price of $ 84.99. That price alone warrants it 5-Stars, without taking into consideration the accessories included. I haven't tried it underwater or mounted on my bike yet, however in my testing of it's abilities it's performed adequately. Obviously, you won't see the 4K video in 4K unless you connect it to a 4K monitor. It blows my mind how many people complain when they try to view footage on their standard 720/1080p monitors, or look at a review on youtube and go ""Hey, that's not 4K! 0 Stars!"" Please understand the way video compression and FPS work at different definitions before you start shopping for a video camera. I also recommend using the appropriate high speed/high capacity SD cards and formatting it using the camera's format function. For a fraction of a GoPro, you get a camera that has an LCD display, many mounting accessories, and two batteries that seems like it can keep up and you won't hate yourself too much if you lose it in the ocean or wherever your decide to film shenanigans.",5,1,2017-2-7,1,1,0
"Hard to beat this camera. I was initially looking to buy a GoPro but couldn't justify the price. This camera is affordable, and for kids, perfect. Good quality pictures so far and no issues.The only issues we had were with the charger and battery as one of the sets wouldn't work. We got the issue resolved though.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
We bought this device for our daughter who had been asking for one for a long time.  She found it very user friendly and lightweight.  It's good value for money and she has been having a lot of fun with it.  She loves it but has yet to try it in water - she is so excited to take it to the lake later this summer. The customer service is very good - they are very attentive and will respond very quickly with answers to your questions.,4,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
easy to transfer videos/picture to the phone. I bought this product for multiple out of the country trips I had coming up.

"I had wanted to get an action camera for a while but wanted to get a well-rated one at a reasonable price.  this camera meets both requirements.

"I've only tested the Akaso for an hour thus far, but so far so good. Video quality is good @ 1080/60 and the camera comes with several attachments. Unfortunately, instructions for said attachments are almost non-existent. Sound is a little muffled, and imagine/video quality would have benefited from optical imagine stabilization. However, EIS does an okay job by action camera standards. Low light performance produces grainy video/pictures. Overall, great value vs GoPro competition. Set expectations appropriately. I'll update my review after further use.Update: After using the Akaso EK7000 for a few weeks now I have to say I am impressed. Is it as good a GoPro? No, but it is comparable enough at a fraction of the cost. The accessories, video quality, and overall quality have impressed. I've updated my score from 3 stars to 4 stars.",4,1,2018-1-7,1,0,0
"I purchased this for using it for youtube and other videos, I was hesitant at first with everyone screaming get a go pro.

"Overall a good camera for the price - as long as you do not need it for long periods of time. The battery life is laughable. I went on a 4-hour rafting trip and the camera only recorded the first hour. I never had one of the more expensive action cameras on the market and have no way of comparing. But if the battery on the other cameras can hold four hours or more, then I would be willing to pay more for those. Having a camera that will die in the middle of your adventure sucks.",2,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"Just yesterday I wrote a review (pasted below), about how this camera is ""Almost perfect"" because of the great quality and value, but that the app did not work, which caused the WIFI feature to be useless. Well, this morning I saw that AKASO reached out and explained that the app is being fixed but we can use  ""iSmart DV"" on the App Store and/or Playstore. I immediately tried and BOOM, it works! So now I can safely say its perfect and a great buy. Love seeing Amazon merchants reading their reviews!**PREVIOUS REVIEW**",5,1,2017-3-3,1,1,0
We bought this for a trip abroad in February and it was terrific!  It was great to not have to worry about it getting wet.

I am a customizer who was looking for a better cam than my iPhone that was also affordable at the same time this was NOT it all the pics they show bs. I couldnt take pics with the cam and see it on my phone it was either or you take the pic and wait to unconnect from the wifi to reconnect the cam to my phone I took about 20 pic none came up I had to manually save them to my phone sad.

"Took on a mud run obstacle course and it got great images, was pretty stable despite being chest mounted and even picked up some sound despite being in the waterproof case.Only draw back (and it may be user error) is it seems that the recordings stops when the file hits 4 gigs in size. Could just be the format of my mem card but thought it was worth noting.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"It feels cheap, shoots poor quality video in dim lighting, has low contrast backlight-bleeding display, 4K video did not work for me - the option was simply disabled in the menu. I chose to ""format"" in the menu, but my card was not formatted. The Android application works, but again is poorly designed and you can't use it to copy files or watch the photos/videos on the SD card (maybe GoPro app doesn't have this feature either, to be honest). I wasn't able to open the battery cover with my nails, too hard, had to use a knife.On the pros side: of course, it is nice to have a GoPro-looking camera for a fraction of its price. Also, it comes a ton of extra gear. And it works more or less. The best of all, however, is that you can send this thing back to Amazon.",1,1,2017-3-22,1,7,0

I am in no way an expert with action cameras and I purchased the EK7000 to get started. The camera is well made and quite small. Yes the body is plastic but I have to say that someone in the design team made an effort to pay attention to details so it feels nice to the touch and well made. Image quality is surprisingly very good for the price and size!The amount of accessories that are added on is incredible! Best bang for the buck!,5,1,2018-6-21,1,1,0
Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks,3,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0

"Great video quality and camera appears easy to use. The documentation that is provided is clear and written in good english which I appreciate. It does not go far enough however. I initially couldn't  get it to connect  to a network. The sticker on the outside of the box solved the issue, the app is now called ""ismart dv"".

great purchase price. plenty of attachment  hardware and 2 batteries with charger. I purchase a 128 gig mini sd card for extra memory and an Anker battery for extra operational duration. I can almost record for 24 hours. This is my first camera so I can only attest to the fact that it is a great pic at 4k and the waterproof casing seams very sturdy. I like the handheld remote for pics or video recording alos. great purchase price for the beginner.,5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0

The footage this camera records is excellent considering the price. however the computer inside it that saves data to the memory card doesn't work at times. I will find that a whole day of recording has been wasted because the footage does not exist on the card or has been corrupted. have tried different memory cards thinking that was the problem. the problem is the camera itself. besides this one bug the camera works great. unfortunately it is such a huge bug that it makes me leave only 2 stars,2,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
I just received my AKASO EK7000 today. After trying the still shot mode as well as the video mode I have come to the conclusion that this camera is definitely better (quality wise) for the video feature. The remote control makes filming as well as taking a picture extremely easy as well as user friendly. For the price and the number of accessories that come with the camera it is a great deal. My only complaint so far ( in just a few hours of use) is the audio recording quality which could be better.,5,1,2018-6-20,1,2,0
"For the money, I don’t think you can do better. This little guy exceeded my expectations. I’ve used only for a few days, but m impressed. I do wish it had an external mic input, but for the price point I can’t complain. I use this for in car and outside use at the race track. Definitely for out door use, video is pretty dark without lighting when filming in car. Besides that video quality is impressive. I plan on buying more for different angles. Money well spent to get me started out.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"This camera is a nice product. I use it to record my drive to and from work each day. The battery runs down after 30-40 minutes, so the battery charger is a companion you want to keep with you.

I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend because he loves outdoors and doing spartan races. So he was really excited that it was water resistant and could use it while racing. The only issue he was having was that it is difficult to figure out how to use. It didn’t really come with the proper instructions on how to get it started and use it. He had to look up everything on YouTube which was okay for him but annoying because the instructions should have been inside the box of the product. Overall he loves the gift but is still trying to figure out how to work the camera. He has issues with it deleting and keeping some of the files as if it’s overwriting footage.,4,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
I purchased the Asako EK7000 camera to replace my GoPro and was rather skeptical at first but after using the camera it really is a no brainer.

The bought the camera to attach on to my motorcycle helmet and thanks to the mounts that came with it, made everything super simple. Honestly couldn't ask for a better camera to ride with, the clarity is amazing and very stable.

Okay for the money if you're using it for non-professional uses or giving it to your kids to mess around with, but even then there's better options. I'd recommend spending a little more money and getting something better. YouTube reviews of this camera will show you better options for the same price.

Can't wait to really get out there and use it for what I bought it for which is my trip back to Asia next week.  After that I'll be able to really share my experience, but so far so good.

You also get extra accessories with this buy as opposed to buying it separate like you if you bought a standard GoPro. My son enjoys using this little camera when he is outside riding his bike up and down the hill or while doing flip stunts. We highly recommend this stunt camera.",4,1,2017-3-11,1,1,0
Got this Camera to record my bicycle commute to work. The Camera works well without the App. The Remote control works well. All the fittings and accessories allow you to mount the camera to do different things. For $50 this camera is pretty good. The menus and app are pretty user brutal and can be made more user friendly. The manual is biased towards apple computers.,4,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
Great camera and can't figure out why you would pay so much more for a Go Pro.  I used this on a canyoning and surfing trip in Australia and for some snorkeling in Hawaii in addition to some local mountain biking.  After about a year and a half with the product I had an issue with the firmware that the customer service team helped me troubleshoot.  Troubleshooting didn't work so they sent me a brand new one of the more recent model even though mine was technically out of the warranty by a few months.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if needed.,5,1,2018-3-2,1,0,0
"I bought this camera because my 8 year old son wanted a Go-Pro camera so he could start his own YouTube channel and for the price, it made a great Christmas present. This is a great camera for a novice or kid that really just wants something to play around with or someone who wants to get started doing video. Since I didn't spend a lot of money on it, I'm not too worried if it gets lost or broken. Getting started using it was a little bit of struggle since the instructions are digital, but once you figure it out, it is not to bad. Still waiting on my son to start that YouTube channel though.",4,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
I was considering buying a more expensive camera but this one works great and it comes with a lot of great features.  I like the wrist band remote the most and all of the different mounting options it comes with.  It also connects to an iPhone or other smart device to control the unit and take pictures and video and use as a remote view screen and download saved content.  Great deal and tons of fun!,5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"This is a good little camera for the money.  We used it while snorkeling in Mexico and I was able to get some very nice video of the sea turtles and fish.  What surprised me is how well it works for still photos, much better resolution than the camera on my phone.  Hard to beat the accessories included for the price.  My original camera had a spot in all of the photos and videos but Akaso replaced it with a new camera.  So far I’m happy.",5,1,2018-6-13,1,0,1
"So, let me say, for the price, compared to a GoPro, you can't beat it. Compared to LiDow brand, it's better than that too. I would recommend this to a friend, however there are some Cons that make me a little hesitant.Pros:",3,1,2017-1-12,1,0,0
"I bought this product to go on a cruise with my sons (8 and 11). Initially, this was a great purchase. Similar items are more than twice the price, and for an underwater camera, this was a great option. All but one thing about the camera was great. The wifi did not work correctly. I called the next business day and spoke to someone who said to send it back and they would replace it. I did and am very happy with our new one. It all works great and even upgraded to the Pro. Thanks for making a great product reasonably priced.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"I bought this for my 13 year old to use on a trip to Hawaii. I used a GoPro Hero Black 7 and he used the Akaso.  When I uploaded the video, I could barely see any difference in the shots. It worked flawlessly. Highly recommended for water, and other action video and stills.",4,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"Bought this item for some family pictures and videos of our vacation to California. Beautiful quality, shipping was fast, and you cant beat the price. I would recommend this product and would definitely buy again.  I have plans to buy another to start my new YouTube channel. This product comes with 2 batteries that last a g amount of time.  Cant wait to capture more memories. Also means the wife have used it to make our own videos at night time if ya know what I'm saying and the picture quality in the lighting is amazing. My wife and I are very satisfied to say the least 😁",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"Firstly, maybe I didn't notice when I purchased, but there are a lot of little gadgets in the box. This was nice. We bought this to record our biking outings. The camera is very clear, very stable. I haven't tried the water resistance as yet but it looks very secure. This camera is awesome value for money. My only complaint is that it doesn't pick up audio very well. Maybe because the camera is locked in the waterproof holder.. other than that, awesome buy",4,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"Haven't used it in water, purchased it for filming automotive repair work and for my particular application so far it's worked great, especially for the price. Would definitely buy this product again and I certainly would recommend it to others looking for a camera like this.",5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
"I purchased one of these a year ago and was highly impressed with the quality of the video for the price. I was so impressed that I purchased another one in January. Now after little use, like clock work, both of them have ceased to function completely. You turn on the power, see the product screen, then nothing. There is still power, but no display. I effectively have a load of mounts and 2 ultralight paperweights. Don't go the cheap route, get quality gear that stands the test of time. These unfortunately don't fall in to that category.",1,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"Just like your favorite name-brand action camera but less than half the price. Very basic functions but the app control works very well. I haven't dropped it yet but it seems sturdy. Overall a great camera, for the price you can't get much better.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it. She already used it in the pool and it’s 100% waterproof. She also went on a bike ride and got it all on camera. She’s absolutely loves it. I would recommend this one.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"The camera itself was good but the attachments are next to impossible to figure out without any instructions.An update to this review.  I was recently contacted by customer service concerning my comments about my purchase .  I was offered a new camera with the correct attachments for the application I want to use the camera for.  They were very helpful in resolving all the issues I told them about.

"This turned out to be exactly what I wanted. It is a perfect camera for my needs. I wanted an action camera, but didn't want to pay the high price of some brands.Once I got it set up and used it some today, I am not sure how I could get better out of one of the more expensive cameras. I would recommend this to anyone for normal action use.",5,1,2019-3-5,1,0,0
"Good for the price. Not the most clear or HD camera but it is good for the price and comes with TONS of accessories and different attachments. Looking forward to use this underwater!UPDATE: After leaving a 3 star review on this camera, AKASO emailed me offering a refund or replacement and wanted to ensure my 100% satisfaction. I have since used this camera underwater in Panama and the pictures turned out good. No complaints at all about this camera, and very impressed with AKASO's customer service.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"While this is still not a GoPro, by any means, the newer version is a lot better than the previous incarnation.  Firstly, the battery lasts a lot longer.  Secondly, the colour balance is much more ""real.""  Thirdly, the files no longer curt when you try to transfer them.  It is still a little ""foggy"" in low light conditions, but for outdoor sports, it is almost indistinguishable from a Go Pro.",4,1,2018-9-11,1,0,0
The video and images you get out of this camera for the price makes it a no-brainer instead of spending almost 10 times on the well-known brands. And the fact you get a screen with super simple interface makes it that much sweeter to use. Waterproof to larger depth and two batteries in the pack means this will be the highlight of any holiday that's by the sea.,5,1,2017-10-1,1,1,0
"UPDATE:I wanted to let people know that the company was very responsive to my  concerns and replaced the remote controls for the cameras that I bought. These are good cameras for the price, hopefully they will make the remote waterproof in the future, so it can be used with the waterproof housing. It doesn't make sense to not have it all waterproof.",3,1,2018-8-4,1,1,1
"This little camera packs a punch with regard to quality and cost. I wanted a compact, high definition action camera to take on bike rides and other action events and didn't want to pay the high cost of a GoPro. With this camera, I not only get the comparable features, but the quality is equal to the most high priced GoPro. Has Wifi and 4K resolution which makes great videos and transferring easy. The attachments that it came with let you mount to just about anything. I was pleasantly surprised.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"Great camera, and it was nice to have so many of the accessories included.  Picture quality is excellent and controls are intuitive.  Our kids have the cameras on their helmets when downhill skiing and we've taken some great videos on a ski vacation in Montana this winter.  Our only complaint is that the battery doesn't perform well in low temperatures - even with a full charge, with some time in the cold the camera/battery registers that a low battery signal.  A minor issue that we learned to work around...overall an excellent way to capture family memories and a fun thing for our kids.",4,1,2018-3-15,1,0,0
"I was quite skeptical given the price of the camera, but overall its performed great! I use it as an action camera on my motorcycle helmet and it works great. The only improvement I could suggest is a longer battery life! You can pickup some replacements pretty cheap.. still way cheaper than a gopro though!",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
I like how the camera comes with all sorts of accessories. The instruction booklet is easy to follow. I did notice that the casing bracket on tripod mounting is a little loose so we'll have to watch out that the Akaso doesn't fall out. Doesn't come with an SD card but does have two batteries. It's charging right now so I haven't tried it out but I'm excited to see how epic this little guy is going to make me look.,5,1,2017-3-17,1,1,0
"I bought this for my son two years ago and it sat unused until now when I decided I needed an action cam for myself. I ”borrowed” his, thinking I would surely need something better than a camera at this price. Better than expected - great picture, great accessories. It can also be used as a web cam - I’ve used it in video conference calls.",4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Great video quality for the price,BUT:  Battery lasted under 10 minutes in cold weather. Wifi remote that connects smartphone to the camera worked well the first 3 times I used it then struggled to connect at all. Wrist remote did not indicate if it was in fact recording. I had to keep asking people around me if the camera was on or recording when it was mounted to my helmet. Easy return via Amazon. Oh, wrong color was shipped to me as well and the camera came off the mount and bounced around in the box prior to arrival. So that wasn't good. I was excited to record my kids skiing, but this is not the proper camera for that.",2,1,2017-1-25,1,1,0
My daughter loves this camera! She downloaded the app and loves that she is able to send pics to friends right from the app instead of having to upload them with the SD card first.  She can’t wait to take it on vacation.  Great camera overall.,5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Love it, bought it after reviewing the high price sports camera's. Took it on our 10 day trip to Hawaii and it is an awesome camera great quality video, pictures not so good I think I might be able to adjust. Was able to get the whole trip on one 32g card. I couldn't be more please with this purchase. Thinking on buying for for our friend in Hawaii. Easy to use to boot.",4,1,2018-10-4,1,0,0
"I got this because of a lightning deal, thinking it was to good to be true.  Since having this camera, I have been on vacation, used it on roller coasters and the pool and normal day to day activity.  I also have a youtube channel and I have used this camera in almost every video I have made since getting the camera.  Very easy to use.  I even let a someone I know from, I won't say the name but it rhymes with (snowglow) take a look at it to compare and I was told virtually the same.  except 1/3 the cost.  The only thing it can not do that a go pro can is time lapse...let me rephrase,  It can time lapse but it can not convert all the images into one video of time-lapse like the newer go pros can.  I love this camera and can't wait to add more to my collection.",5,1,2018-9-6,1,0,0
"This looks to be a very nice little camera. It appears to be as represented  and the price was very competitive with similar cameras. I really wish it had come with an SD card, but I think I have found one that works. I would like to see at least an 8gb card included to get started. That would be convenient for buyers. The number of accessories is good and the size is just right for use on my helmet. There is much to learn about the settings, but it is not as complicated as other cameras I own. In general, it looks like a good buy.",4,1,2017-1-19,1,1,0
"I just played around with this camera today. I am amazed that you can purchase this camera within a reasonable budget as well. You can do anything with it as you can with a Go-Pro. The mobile app is pretty neat as well, my mobile app keeps freezing, but I haven't put too much time into getting it to work. It comes with all add-ons you would need and makes for a complete kit. I'm looking forward to using this product for many projects in the future!",5,1,2016-10-26,1,1,0
"For the price its okay for basic recording. The picture quality isn't great and the sound quality is really bad. You can tell by holding it that the camera and included accessories are cheap plastic. The screen on the back is very poor quality so don't expect to be able to use that for anything other than judging whats in frame.This was purchased for online college as its required to take video of yourself performing certain tasks. It'll work fine for that, not sure what else I'd use it for.",3,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"I needed a webcam, and they are in short supply these days. But this action camera works as a webcam on Windows, could not get it to work on a mac though. On windows, plug in (it turns on and connects as an SD card reader), push the top button so it says PC Camera on the back, and it just works.  I use it without a battery installed. All the extra accessories, batteries, mounts, etc are a great bonus for me use case. Only Caveat is that it's a 170 degree wide angle, it's much wider than a normal webcam.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"So here is the story. I got this wonderful AKASO EK7000 for Christmas. It was totally awesome!!! I went on vacation to California, tested it out in the water, and you won't believe it!!! The camera view was amazing, the sound affect was clear and not annoying, and it was like looking through goggles. So Clear!!! I loved it. The only downfall was the fact that it came with a backup back to the waterproof case, and the back is not even waterproof. Luckily I didn't find out the hard way. I had heard this from a friend and tested it to find out for myself. Dodged a Bullet there!!! Though the one downside, it's only minor, and is not part of the camera, just sort of useless. Love the Product and hope to see more like it.",5,1,2017-12-31,1,1,0
"For a fraction of the cost for what you'd pay for a GoPro, I couldn't be more thrilled with this camera.  I'm just a casual user taking various video of kids events, travelling in a vehicle, etc. and both the video and audio quality are great.  Everything works as advertised and after owning it now for a couple of months, I don't have a single complaint!

It produced good pictures and video. Excellent for the price. However the arm band remote just stopped working after a couple weeks. Worse though is that the mount broke ( the plastic just broke) and my camera went to the bottom of the San Francisco Bay. The base of the mount remained attached. It was attached to a kite that hit the water but the plastic mount on a sports camera should endure that. Disappointing.I am changing to a five star review because they sent me a new camera. SUPERB AFTER SALE SERVICE!,5,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0
"I like it so far. Picture and video quality are clear and honestly for the price, this is a great little camera. I like the versatility of the different mount options it comes with as well. I’ll primarily be using it on my tripod, but if I’m feeling extra adventurous I have the option to try something different! The only reason I have for knocking down a star was the very vague directions that came with it. Sure, it tells you how to use the camera, but not what each mount is for or how to take the waterproof casing off from the display mount. I literally had to google all of that and watch a YouTube video. Other than that, I’m liking it so far and hope to do a follow up review some months to a year in 😉",4,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
Loved this little beauty. It takes great pictures and video and is very comparable to a GoPro. Only drawback what so ever is when the underwater cover is used the sound muffles a bit. But your underwater so what do you expect. Lol,5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"I was a bit skeptical to only spend $50 on an action camera! But I took the chance and I'm so glad! The quality of the camera is pretty good and I can't believe it came with so many attachments!

The camera also has some pretty cool features such as the wireless remote, the wifi connect setting (which allows you to take pictures/videos on your phone and quite a few resolution options (many other cameras I looked at only had one or two!)If you're thinking about buying the Akaso action camera EK7000 - DO IT!",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
I purchased this on a whim because I was taking a trip to Florida. After hours of recording footage I got home only to realize that the video quality is absolutely terrible.

I bought this camera in order to record action videos with my friends for youtube purposes and this camera has exceeded my expectations. I love the wide angle view and the 4K is beautiful.

Night-time quality not so great but all of my deliveries take place during the day so all-in all it works well for me.

Ok.  For the most part this camera seems pretty decent. The functions are easy to understand and operate. The reason for two start is the screen on the camera.

I have tested all features including wifi app and very impressed.,5,1,2017-1-16,1,2,0
This camera in every way. Portable and very useful. I like the image quality of it and how i can even record without feeling like I'm being watched.

It was awesome.  I used it to take videos of all of my kids wrestling matches.  I have never had an issue however last week and I have only had it since November It suddenly stopped charging the batteries in the camera.

Took it to Hawaii without much of a chance to look at it before going and was a bit disappointed that there was no wrist strap included.

It's not important but the battery door on the camera was broken out of the box, making is very hard to open the battery door.

"Awesome camera! Using this for my quadcopter to get HD footage of some of my flights. Camera is small and light, which is a major plus when every gram counts, and the footage is awesome. We got a GoPro Hero Session for christmas, and I wanted something cheaper that I wouldn't be *as* disappointed if it was destroyed in a crash. Found this deal and jumped on it. The whole lower half of the box is jammed with accessories, way more than we got with the GoPro. Footage is roughly comparable, although some of the colors aren't quite as vibrant, but that can easily be adjusted in typical video software. 3D printed a mount for the drone, which I had to make by hand, as this is not quite as popular as the GoPro where thingiverse has a plenty of GoPro prints available.

I just purchased this AKASO last week and have already had some fun using it!  So far it works great and its at a great price compared to the GoPro.  We will see how it holds up over time but for $65 ... its a steal!  Its also great that all the GoPro accessories seem to fit this as well...however I could be wrong on some but I've had zero issues so far.,5,1,2017-11-3,1,1,0
It's a great little camera. I haven't taken it under/in the water yet. But I know/learn more about the camera I'll be sure to update my review. But thus far it's just as good as my GoPro and between two and three quarters of the cost ( Sorry GoPro ). It also comes with most of the accessories needed to mount to the more commen places including bike and car windows.,5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,1
"We purchased this as an alternative to the GoPro cameras and have not been disappointed.  4 stars because the audio is just not there, however, this will be a great stationary camera to catch action and we can dub audio over it.  The video quality is excellent for about $60 bucks.  I have not compared it to the GoPro cameras, but couldn’t be happier with the video quality.  If you are looking to just capture the video and not worried about the audio, make this purchase.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"This handy camera came with every connector or attachment you could need for every adventure you might go on. We used it for hiking and ziplining and it worked very well. The sound was a bit muffled, since it was in it's protective case, but the picture was clear and the video was very clean and even transferred well onto a large TV screen.",5,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
"We bought this for our son who loves making his own action videos. He has rode his horse with this as well as other activities and the videos turned out great!

"Sucks.  Two weeks after Amazon return date, just as I was leaving on a bike packing trip, the thing won’t turn on.  Tried everything in the manual but it’s dead. Guess going cheap is cheating reliability .  Will have to purchase a GoPro (gulp) to start my trip.  Don’t know who was rating this camera so high, guess they are not using it!",1,1,2020-4-2,1,1,0
Camera works great. Put it on my helmet to video my quad and rzr rides. Picture is great and sound quality is remarkable even through my full face shield helmet. I put a 64 gb in it and it works great. For the price you can't beat it. Love this little camera. Had this camera 3 months now and not a problem. I use it 2-3 times a week. I have never had a gopro but I can't see it being 3 times better to justify the price.,5,1,2018-2-28,1,0,0
"I recently purchased this product not really knowing alot about it.  There was good reviews and bad reviews, but I decided to take a chance and purchase it and so far I like it.  I am definitely taking this product to universal with me in May and I am sure I will still get great pictures and videos with it as well.  I am excited about purchasing this product for all my outdoor outings.  I feel like I am definitely getting my moneys worth out of it.  You can't complain with the product for the great price it was.  I love my new Sports Camera.  I definitely was impressed on how fast I got my product as well.  It was at my home at the date promised can't get any better than that.",5,1,2018-1-1,1,1,0
This is a great little camera for the price. I have been shopping for a decent action cam for a price that is justifiable and this fits the bill. Works great for what it is. It is not a professional grade camera however it works awesome for me! I use this on dive trips and the waterproof case is great the buttons are easy to use and it is pretty simple to use. The battery life is adequate it comes with 2 if you need more get more. People complain too much! Many cameras are battery hogs it's a fact of life. Personally I love this little thing.,5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"This is a great camera!  I never did an underwater video before.  This was easy to set up, easy to connect to WiFi and my phone.  It took great videos even though I had no clue about how to use it correctly.  Plus I took it to 93 feet deep thinking it would flood.  Nope. It was bone dry.  I recommend it highly.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"This thing is awesome right out of the box! For the price, with two batteries, and all accessories, you can't beat it! I used it all night in a race car at Daytona and it survived the heat, humidity, and vibration. Image quality was awesome.

"This is a great action camera, considering the price in contrast with an actual go-pro and this thing is awesome. Im not exactly a tec guru but the photos are high quality as is video. It is easy enough to use that my 7 y/o daughter makes videos of her own just like her favorite YouTube videos. Tours of our vegie garden, tutorial on riding her bicycle. Anyway, unless you are looking to make professional productions (Probably would work for that as well) this is the best choice.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"Honestly I purchased a GoPro hero session and I just wasn’t satisfied. I did my research and looked around and found his beautiful camera. When it arrived first thing that stunned me and made me fall in Love was how it came in the box. Compared to my GoPro, it was like gold bar that came in the mail. Next, the amount of accessories was amazing and very appreciated. The remote, very important Nd handy, also very appreciated. Finally , quality of product, amazing. The clear image and the nice sound, I was happy of the purchase. definitely would try out this camera.",5,1,2018-8-13,1,0,0
Love this little camera.  Takes some Google searching to learn about how to do some things because the manual is good but not detailed.  I've never used any kind of action camera so I was bewildered by some of the mounts and brackets.  But I will be using a tripod 95% of the time so that's ok.  It was easy to setup.  I have an iPhone so I'm using the iSmart DV app and it was also easy to setup and use.  I love the size and features on this camera and love the price point even more!,5,1,2017-3-19,1,1,0
I had been wanting a camera for some while not to record the things I do outdoors but did not want to sacrifice quality.  This camera has been almost PERFECT!  The app that it connects to is super easy to use and a great tool.  The quality of this camera and the extras it comes with is absolutely unbelievable.  The only downside I have had using this camera revolves around the battery.  I feel as if the battery runs out too quickly and that directly affects a key function...the time stamp.  Any time a battery is taken out the camera it resets the time on it which is extremely inconvenient when in action.,4,1,2020-3-22,1,0,1
"Wasn't sure what to expect given all the reviews and the digging I did about this product especially after I received it I understood why it had so many reviews.  Lots of reviews due to the free gift they give you if you write a review, hence why I'm writing one.  Some would say this is deceptive marketing, I would say so too if the product in fact was crap which it isn't.This sports action camera so far for me has been a great purchase.  I've had it for about a month now and have taken a few videos.  It's very easy to use and the quality of the videos from what I have taken so far is exactly what I expected.  For me this was a very good alternative to the much more expensive gopro and this camera comes with a variety of accessories. I'm very pleased with this purchase and can't wait to continue using it.",4,1,2017-4-16,1,0,0
"I haven't used it for long, but it's a fun little camera that is great for beginners who want to try out action-type videos without a lot of financial risk. It's just okay as a camera, but again, a really good starting point for those with an interest in trying it out. The video is just some snow outside my door, but it shows the general quality.Biggest upsides: easy to use (except for the wifi connection thing, it's much easier to plug the camera into my computer), fun, waterproof, and inexpensive",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

"The GoPro Akaso Ek5000 is a great camera overall. Everything about the quality of the picture, to the sound is great. I find this product useful wherever I go. I live the way it feels like there is nothing even on you and everything is normal, but your recording your every step. Only problem is that getting the micro SD card is a bit of hassle. I was running from Rite aid to Walmart trying to find one and finally succeeded. One other problem is that I could have got some great footage but did not know when my camera was ready to record. I recommend if you are wearing a helmet of some sorts, ask someone to check if your camera is on(It always sucks to lose great footage from a great camera:) Overall the Akaso Ek5000 GoPro camera is cheap, well workling, and a great camera.",4,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0
"This camera is an awesome value!  The price is reasonable.  The quality of the camera and accessories is excellent.  And, there are more accessories than you'll ever use, for almost any application you could think of.  The camera is easy to operate, and the waterproof case fits snugly.  The wrist-strap remote is incredibly handy, and an extra battery is included.It does not include a memory card, which are easily purchased.",5,1,2018-8-16,1,1,0
Bought this product due to the high review ranking. Don't be fooled by this. After getting it home and using it for a few days it began to start freezing and failing. The camera got very hot after just a few mins of use. Returning it and buying another camera.,1,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
The camera is a great price for what it is and comes with tons of accessories. It says it has 4K picture but I don’t think the quality is up to standard on that could be a lot better. It’s kind of pixel looking compared to the go pro. With all the said it’s a decent product for the price.,4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I got this camera to film my driver's around the state. Once I figured out it connects via wi-fi and not Bluetooth, I was set. Connects easily to my phone. Easy to use, I do recommend reading manual. Picture quality is great once transferred, hard to see in the cam itself and is easier on the phone. Using an Android phone btw. Comes with a bunch of accessories and straps. Definitely worth the buy if you want something cheaper then the go pro.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
Very pleased with camera. Learning to use it but that is seemingly easy. Easy connection to phone via the app. Pleased with both video and photo quality. Only reason for scoring of stabilization is it is not available on this model. Two thumbs up!,5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"Purchased the camera to shoot some training videos, and to use for live music sessions. Have used it for the training videos so far, and it has worked great.The one suggestion I have is to not charge the batteries and let them sit for a few days before using them. They have a slow discharge, so they don't last very long if they have sat for days.",5,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0
"Kinda a cheapy device. Advertising makes it seem as strong as a go pro but its no where close. It is good for little small things like recording while driving ( dash cam ) or simple picture taking, dont expect photographer quality images tho.",3,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
We use this camera while we are jeeping mounting it to our jeep and using the remote to control when it records does a great job easy to use easy to take off and then take stills as well also nice to be able to get wet when we go thru the creeks and rivers.,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
It’s a decent camera that comes with a ton off add on items. The wrist remote is a cool addition to the camera. The sound quality is very poor. The WiFi feature does work but I had to google the password online being that it wasn’t in the instruction manual. Overall it’s decent but the sound quality is very low. Also there’s an app where you can do playback and other things.,4,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
"Very pleased with this product. Feels like a quality product, the packaging is nice and comes with a lot of accessories. I bought it for an upcoming family trip to Costa Rica to get some action shots in the water, in the jungle and zip-lining and I think it will be a perfect fit for that. I'm excited about the waterproof case and not having to worry about damage in the water, on the beach or in the jungle. I also like that it fits accessories from other competitive products.",5,1,2017-1-22,1,1,0
"This is my second AKASO action camera. I bought a second one because I have had no issues with the first one. It is light weight, takes a great picture and video, and is easy to use. The accessories that come with the camera are an added bonus. The only thing I haven't liked is the battery compartment -- it is a little difficult to open. I broke the tab opening it on my first camera. Even though the tab broke the hatch still shuts and stays closed. You can't go wrong with this purchase in my opinion.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
This is a pretty great camera compared to the other high priced ones in the market. It comes with so many accessories that you don't need to go out and buy anything right away. The wrist camera and video buttons is great and makes taking shots on the go really easy. The picture quality is great! The indoor shots are a little dark but thats to be expected in my opinion. When its bright out the pictures turn out great. Ive taken many under water creek shots and they are great! Sound is good even with the water tight case on.,5,1,2017-5-11,1,1,0

Also, some of the hardware is not stainless for the attachments, and they corroded when I took it to the beach.  The camera itself functions good though.",3,1,2017-8-23,1,1,0
"Even though this camera isn't a GoPro, it's a steal for the price. The image stabilization is okay. It just depends on how you hold the camera. I bought a separate stick attachment so that helps with the stabilization. The picture quality is great, especially for an action camera that's 60 bucks! It's not as good as other action cameras such as a GoPro, but it's still good quality. The waterproof case works great. I've taken it underwater multiple times already, and so far, nothing has gotten damaged. Overall, I think it's a great camera to get, especially if you don't want to spend 300 dollars on another action camera. The Akaso does just the trick.",4,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0

"Haven't had any hardcore experience yet but so far it takes good enough photos and videos for the price. At least as good as a iPhone 5.

Video quality is fair in well lit environments only. Photo quality is poor when well lit and extremely poor in dimmer environments . Overcast day caused very poor lighting (usually optimal lighting for photography).,2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
I really like the camera pretty easy to use if you just read through the answers on here. Great picture. The app on the other hand I have had no luck with at all. It works maybe one time after I install it than says the contact the dealer about over heating issues. After you uninstall and reinstall it may work one or two more times than pop up with the same message. I do not care if there may be a recall you should still be able to use the app the camera functions fine. I do not even think the app knows what camera is connected there doesn't seem to be a way to select you device. And it says I am using some 360 degree view camera not the ek7000.,4,1,2017-6-7,1,1,0
Video quality on every setting sucks. Pics are great if you are inches away. Always blurred video unless very still and inches away in optimal lighting. The case is waterproof at least. Good camera for kid's to tinker with. 8 to 10 year old range.,2,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0

Great quality for the price.,5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
I received this yesterday and although it all looked okay when I unboxed it the image quality is not at all what other reviews stated for video or stills.  My two year old Samsung  s5 shoots better video and pics.  Also the camera freezes when I try to use anything higher than 1080p mode.  I have another sd card on order that will arrive tomorrow in case that is the issue but I don't think that is the problem.  I leave for a trip that I purchased this for in 3 weeks and don't have time to mess around with trying another one.  Most likely I will have to bite the bullet and get a real one from GoPro.,1,1,2017-6-8,1,2,0
"I purchased my AKASO EK7000 on Dec. 29, 2019. I loved everything about it. All the accessories and the wide angle, HD, 4K. The picture is awesome and as good as the GP For a lot less money.Finally had a chance to fire up my replacement after my first one crashed. Everything is back to normal and pleased with the camera. Probably would have got a 5, However to charge you for assistance on their product should be re-thought.",4,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
I bought this early for our trip to Hawaii where we plan on swimming with dolphins and sea turtles! I read plenty reviews before purchase. I just received it and adjusted the settings to beat picture/video quality! So far the camera is super clear when turned on! My micro sd card isn’t here so I haven’t seen the actual picture quality but if it looks like the screen does then I’m super impressed! Will be doing a pre-trip water test on the case (it appears to be really secure) and I may come back and update this review after! Definitely happy with my purchase so far!,5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,1
This camera is really a joy to use. It took me a little while to become totally familiar with how to adjust things...but once you do it becomes easy to do. For the price you cannot beat it. The AKASO EK7000 performs as well as the high-end competition!,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"I was surprised by this camera, the video looks really good, and the camera is really easy to use. The pics are really nice as well, looks great underwater took to local pool to try it out. Going to be my action cam when I am in Hawii, leave soon. But for the price I do not think you can get a better action camera",5,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0
So I’m trying to get into making church promo videos at my church so I had to look into buying one of these small cameras I was gonna buy a go pro but it was way to expensive for a high schooler like me so I looked into AKASO and the price looked really good a little to good if you know what I mean but after using it for heavily for a day it’s great the quality is super good I charged the batters and used it right away. We played slip and slide kickball and It was so handy and the shots it took looked soo good. 20/10 for someone wanting to buy one and not spend 300 dollars,5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"For the price I paid, this thing is fantastic!! Picture quality is excellent, beats out my more expensive action cam. Fits all go pro accessories which is nice. Super easy interface to use. Battery life seems to be pretty good as well.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
The case filled with water the first 5 minutes we used it. We are hoping it was just a defective case bc the reviews are so great! Reordering today with fingers crossed!- update! The company contacted me and replaced the camera FREE of charge! How cool is that?! We are excited to give it a try again since everyone else raves about it! What great customer service! 5 stars!,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"This camera is absolutely wonderful. I was looking to get a GoPro and didn't want to spend $400. I couldn't believe when I saw the price.  I thought it was a joke.I was hesitant,  but I was willing to try it.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
This is my first go style camera. There are lots of components inside the package that will allow for many mounting scenarios. It looks to be of good quality. The waterproof case appears to be water tight. I'll know more after my off shore trip next month. There is one curious component - a back cover for the waterproof enclosure that has slots for mounting with a strap - the slots of course make the enclosure not water tight. All in all a great value for the price.,5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"It took a little while to figure out how it works and where the manual is, but now that I think of it it's just like my unpacking experience for my go pro camera.  This comes at a fraction of the cost and works well for a similar purpose.  My kids will have loads of fun with this filming his bike ride and swimming adventures.The wifi connection works well and frankly is less cumbersome than the connection process for go pro.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
Speechless. We purchased this for the kids to play with in the pool and to our surprise the quality of photos and videos was amazing! So easy to use our 9 year old son can operate it with no issues. We will be taking this with us everywhere now!If you’re second guessing this product... just don’t! It’s worth every penny!,5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,1
"Nice product and considerably cheaper than the competition.  Wish it had a true time-lapse mode.  (Mode works, but display remains on and drains standard battery in <1 hr.  Only real disappointment is that I was hoping for a crisper image in photo mode.  Still, very happy overall. Used in some extreme conditions, (caving & kayaking), without a single failure.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,1,0
This camera is awesome!! The price can't be beaten!! It came with alot of accessories which in my opinion is a PLUS! Great quality and very easy to manage. Great buy! 💯,5,1,2019-9-13,1,1,1
"I’m so happy with this camera! I bought it to have something to take pictures underwater and it does great. It took a little research to figure out how to set the exposure and some other settings, but once I played around with it the quality of my pictures and videos were outstanding and you can’t beat the price. I really like how I could access the app on my phone and see what I was viewing through the camera on my phone, sometimes it was hard to see how good the quality of the picture or video would be viewing it though the camera as the screen is pretty tiny, but I’m very pleased!",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,1
"The picture quality is fantastic on this camera. It has a nice wide angle lense that captures a fantastic field of view. The ""Burst Photo"" option is a nice feature for taking pictures of moving objects. The audio is good for a device of this size.The only con I've had so far is with clip 2. The camera can only point in one direction with this clip making it very limited. All of the other mounts are interchangable and quite versatile.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
My son loves this camera. It’s easy for him to use and he is 12. Image clarity is great for the price of the camera. He opted for this over the top name brand camera and he is not disappointed. His YouTube channel will soon be filled with even more action! Thanks for an awesome at an affordable price! We would purchase again. Sturdy construction,5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"I compared this to the GoPro and was skeptical at first.  I can say this was probably the best decision I made as it is just as good if not better than the GoPro at a 3rd of the price or less.  With all the accessories it comes with plus remote, A++!  Why pay for a name(GoPro) when the AKASO is just simply better in my opinion.  A co-worker who owns three GoPro's is now jealous of my AKASO.  Easy to use, just plain EXCELLENT!",5,1,2017-1-18,1,1,0
"This camera is great for the price listed. I am using this camera for my certifications and exams as they request for in-person. The picture quality is great and does not fade away. i was debating to buy the camera reading the initial reviews, but i love the camera..would recommend to buy it to my friends",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"I purchased this to video and provide lesson for tennis.  The camera is perfect especially with the camera remote to turn the camera on and off when I need.  The only problem I have is the camera turning off after it's been running for a while.  Perhaps its the heat that shuts it off, not sure but this is usually after about 15-20 min of filming nonstop. Overall happy with the product.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I was hoping for a slightly longer battery life, but the fact they give you two batteries is definitely a plus. It's just a matter of remembering to change the battery after 60 minutes of activity. Otherwise, exactly as advertised.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
I received this camera as a gift.  I had asked for something like a Go-Pro but less expensive since I didn't know how much I would use it or if I would manage to break it somehow (mountain bike crash perhaps?).  So far I have been pleased with the camera.  I was amazed by all the accessories and that it came with a spare battery. The remote is a nice addition but the strap is uncomfortable and not adaptable to a handlebar.,5,1,2017-1-17,1,1,0
"tested out some features. The battery life is short, it says it's only 90 minutes and it's quite accurate. It may seem troublesome to walk around with this camera plus a lot of extra batteries, but for the price it's worth it and plus the batteries are small as well. This little camera serves it purpose, the video quality is awesome and we purchased an SD card to go with it. It came with a lot of accessories, no explanation on how to use them, but we can figure it out. We are not professionals, but it will serve the purpose of preserving our vacation memories.",4,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"bought it because of the decent reviews, not sure if its only mine that was acting up but it wouldn't record anything sometimes, sometimes it would do its own thing and time loop by it self by 10-15 seconds for a few vids then record normally or it would record for 15 seconds and stop recording completely , I tried taking the batt out and putting it back in, it still continued, and the settings wouldn't save at all.",2,1,2019-7-31,1,1,0
"A great video camera, but not the best pictures. I just came back from a trip were I got to try the Akaso EK7000. My comments are: for the price unde $70usd I think is a great video camera, I took great underwater videos and I loved the quality, I did not try the 4k resolution, but the 1080 was just fine. The camera is easy to operate once you start playing with it. As for all the gadgets that come with it, the best is to look for a youtube video on how to use them, as the instructions are not detailed. The cons, the pictures I took were not good, and the video quality in low light conditions is not great. For the price I would recommend it if a sports video camera is what you are looking for",4,1,2018-4-30,1,0,0
"Is a cheap camera with good resolution but it overheat after 5 or more minutes of using, even sometimes the mobil application doesn't connect because the camera is overheated. On the other hand sometimes the button to take pictures from bracelet doesn't work it seems like it no respond when theres a lot of wifi connections near. Anyway it has a good features but it still needs some fixes.",3,1,2017-8-30,1,1,0
"I have had this camera for a day and I am already loving it! It has a great quality waterproof case and a lot of accessories that come with it. You can mount it on a helmet, kayak, go underwater, mount it on a tripod, and other cool things. It would be a little more convenient if the image stabilization was a little better. I also don't really like the mic. It is horrible. I had to buy an external mic to use with it. Overall I would give this camera a 7/10 for this price.",4,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"Update:  Akaso went overboard with customer service to make sure that I was satisfied with the camera.  Sent two replacement WP cases to replace the broken one.Nice and small, lightweight with many extras.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,1
I bought this camera as a gift becuase I wanted something similar to a go-pro but more cost effective and I was not disappointed. We compared this to the footage from our go-pro and it was very similar. The design and features are as well and it is an extremely high quality camera. We have used it in the pool as well as traveling. It has been a great camera and I would highly recommend it to anyone!,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
Amazon states that the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports camera is their choice for “ Go Pro” and I AGREE... this sports camera is well built easy to use and has many of the same functions as a Go Pro has but is a lot less expensive. I dunked it underwater for a few minutes ( maybe 10’ ) and no water leaks and picture quality was amazing..,5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they’ll give you another accessory that you’ll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow.",1,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"EK7000 comes packaged with 90% of what you need.  I would have said 100%, but it does not include a memory card as shipped.  Plenty of adapters for most users.  Easy to get the camera operating and ready to shoot video.  At this price point, if it falls off my track car and is destroyed, I can afford a replacement.  Sorry about the no track video, but I broke the engine last time out.  I am looking forward to using this soon.",4,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
The AKASO Action Camera is an amazing camera for doing any outdoor activities. I took some videos with this camera when I went kayaking and I have to say the picture quality was better than I thought. The wide lens allowed me to capture great pictures when I was on the ocean. And the price for this product is much cheaper than any other camera I was searching for with this good quality.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
This is my second Akaso (lost the first one over the side after two years)  I am very satisfied with the quality of the videos and the ease of use.  The remote start is essential for starting the camera after getting a fist on the line.  The other biggest selling point for me is the adaptability of all the go pro accessories.  I love this camera and the price fits my budget.  Thanks,5,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
"I've always been an outdoor guy, and after much research watching youtube videos that compare this camera with the GoPro, I decided to buy it.  I have absolutely no regrets.  The camera delivers astonishing pictures and videos.  The accessories are extremely affordable, and it comes with an array of mounting brackets to include the head mount.  It is well worth the money.  I recommend this product without a doubt.",5,1,2017-5-2,1,2,1
"Worked great for maybe 2 hours of use. I was very impressed to start, but that quickly changed. This camera is complete garbage and I’ve gone through 4 cameras trying to resolve the issue (all 4 have had the same issue). After 2 uses, the screen would go black after turning it on. Save your money and buy a legit GOPRO. The contact I’ve been working with has been helpful and considerate, but in the end I am stuck with a camera that doesn’t work, I missed many trips that I would love to have on film, and spent money shipping my faulty cameras back to the seller.",1,1,2018-2-19,1,1,0

The sports camera is the best product I have purchased so far this year. The picture quality and ease of use far surpasses the Go-Pro brand. The accessories are interchangeable with Go-pro and with the click n play hand carry device makes moments to capture effortless!Now AKASO is in 4K resolution and demonstrates brilliant picture even in low light settings. I highly recommend purchasing the 32 gig flash card around $8-11 which enables short 60 seconds bursts of action.,5,1,2017-1-17,1,1,0
"Takes nice pictures and video but the battery life has been really really bad.  Even with the two included batteries, I was having trouble keeping the charge on.  Also, even when fully charged, sometimes it won't power on without connecting it to live USB power.  When I connect it to a USB battery pack, it jump starts the camera to turn on, and works.  Also, removing battery and re-seating it will get it to boot.  Simply pressing the power button has been a problem for me.",2,1,2017-10-19,1,1,0
"I use this camera on my my bicycle trips. The image stabilization is pretty good and the 4k videos are a treat. The pack came with all needed accessories to mount on a bike (except for the SD card). For the price you pay, it's more than an awesome deal.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"This little camera is great!  Comes with an awesome bundle of accessories (2 batteries, several mounts, wrist remote, etc.).  Takes great photos and videos, clear LCD screen on the back, what more can you ask for?  This is a no brainer when comparing it to a Go Pro...you can get 5-6 of these for the price of 1 GoPro, and the picture and video quality is basically the same.  Highly recommended!",5,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0

Really pleased as compared to the price for a ‘Brand Name’ such as GoPro.  Went whitewater rafting with a friend and could not tell the difference and the case on the Akaso gave better sound quality after being submerged.  A little fog in the case first use and be warned the arm remote is not waterproof I killed it (but it told me that it was only resistant that’s my fault)! Very happy with this unit!!,5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0

Couldn't be happier with this camera.  Bought it for my son's 13 bday.  He uses it to video his hockey tricks for his Instagram page.  Picture quality is just as good if not better than Go Pro at a fraction of the cost.  Highly recommend this camera.,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

"Great camera, high quality picture. Had to search for some basic set up instructions, but once it was up and running I was blown away by the quality the camera produced. The wide angle made it incredibly useful for shooting sports action as it showed the entire field.

I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a Go Pro as my typical usage is very basic. I was looking for a camera just to record outdoor adventures. After looking on amazon I came across this camera AKASA EK7000 and I could not be happier with my choice. Yes it doesn't compare to Go Pro's but for my needs it does just fine.

The quality of the video is decent and given what you pay and that the kids tend to be hard on things it was well worth it.

I plan on using it to record track days on my car and this camera fits the bill perfectly. It even includes in the box about 10-15 different accessories that can be used to mount the camera to pretty much anything.

For under $60 not more than I could ask for.  Easy to use and set-up.  Just follow the instructions.  Plenty of mounting accessories and mounted right to the GoPro mount installed in my Toyota Tacoma.  Video was great with no noticeable vibration.

In addition it comes with two batteries which is extremely helpful for the long trips. The image quality is respectable for the price.

This is a nice compact camera that is a great value for the price. It comes with many attachments and a water proof case. So far it has worked very well. You can expect decent quality video and picture. I found the 4K quality to be underwhelming but the 1080 options worked very well. The WIFI app integration is easy to use. If you want to shoot more professional grade then you may want to buy one of their more expensive options with the better 4K rendering capability. Overall I am satisfied and would purchase the camera again.,5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"This little unit is pretty good.  Good quality video for a great price.  You receive a ton of accessories.  I like the WiFi connection to my phone so I can use this as a back-up camera for our travel trailer.  With so many accessories, it's easy to mount the camera on the back of the trailer.  In addition, I can mount the camera on our tow vehicle when I'm hooking up the trailer.  Lots of options.  One downside is sometimes my recordings would get lost.  When I uploaded the videos, I would occasionally get an error message that rendered the recording useless.  Can't figure out how to fix that.  Totally bummed, especially when the DeLorean passed us on the freeway.  I recorded everything only to find out later the file was corrupt.

The footage is a bit shaky but that was expected since I have it attached to my front rack. Overall I'm happy and will be buying more cameras from akaso.,5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0

"I was very disappointed... great reviews but it’s not up for the Texas heat. I’ll be recording for 10 minutes or less and it’ll over heat and freeze. It won’t save when it freezes,  so you’ll loose whatever you had recorded.",2,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0

Purchased for 13 year old son. Works perfect. He spent a whole day at a water park making clear videos. Waterproof case worked a treat. Came with lots of accessories (not sure what they are all for). Great value for money. Haven't tried the wireless aspect yet - but so far so good.,5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"The camera works well and I'm pleased with it overall, but a couple of the brackets aren't very useful as they're such a tight fit the camera doesn't sit right, and vibration from a passenger vehicle will work it out of the stand. The batteries charge fast. The camera is tiny, but just weighty enough to feel sturdy which is nice. I've submerged it in the waterproof case and had zero issues with leaking.",4,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
I ordered this camera on the recommendation of a friend after coming back from his honeymoon. I myself am going on my honeymoon soon and am eager to have a camera to take video of the excursions i have planned for my trip. From what he has shown me the video quality is great and managing the photos and video through the app is super convenient. I received my package today and was pleasantly surprised with amount of accessories it came with and the detailed easy to follow instructions it came with. There was plenty of different accessories to customize how you want to experience your video recording experience. All in all a good affordable product.,5,1,2017-2-26,1,2,0
"Our 10 year older daughter is fascinated with YouTube, and she wanted a camera that she could use to record more traditional video, but also record in the water.  She has been able to record all of the video she needs, and it has been a great opportunity for us to work together editing and processing the video.  It is the middle of the winter season so we've not been able to test the equipment under water.  The price point is great for our needs.  An entry level, versatile video recording system.",4,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"Software is a little flimsy, crashes a lot. Make sure to get the ISmart DV app, it works a little better than the Akaso app to view, but still crashes repeatedly. Downloading a 20 min video was going to take about 1 hour. Price is low, so no regret. Customer service is very good, and offered to refund 6 weeks after i posted 3 stars, so they deserve another star. The product itself was not expected to be a pro, at this price, but it’s ok.",4,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0
"This was intended to be a Father’s Day gift. My family and I were traveling to Hawaii for vacation and I bought the camera for my father. He can’t swim, so he asked me to take it snorkeling with me so he could see all the fish, turtles, etc.The quality of the pictures/videos that I got is awesome! The underwater case worked like a charm! I purchased a $12 mount/handle from Walmart that was waterproof and floated to go with the camera and I honestly can honestly say I like this set up more than the go pros!",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0

I don't have any experience with gopro's so I don't have a reference but this one works great for me. Great video. I get about 23 minutes per charge. The camera gets warm/hot after that time. Not so much that you can't hold it but but I was a little suprised. I like it.,5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

"This camera was an Amazon daily deal that I bought on a whim and I'm glad I did.  I went on a camping trip with friends the next weekend and this little camera did exactly what I'd hoped it would.I do wish they'd included a little more information in the online manual. When I first started charging the camera, a blue light came on. Usually red indicates when something is charging so I would have liked clarification that I was either charging it correctly, or that it was already charged.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I've never used a go pro before, but these things work exactly as I expected them to. Underwater shots were clear, fast moving was easy to follow with no lag, and the quality of the video is amazing. There are some times when the light changes that it takes time to adjust, but it only seems to happen in extremes (really dark to brightly lit). The Wi-Fi functionality is cool, but it's often leggy and unnecessary. Overall, these things are awesome and a fraction of the price of the top brand name.",5,1,2017-10-15,1,0,0
"This camera is absolutely awesome.! I’m not going to lie, I was a little nervous to buy another brand other than GoPro, because of them being so mainstream. But this camera is out of this world. The picture quality is perfect and I went ahead and got the larger SD card so it can keep up with the 4K capability. I can’t wait to take this camera on all of my adventures with my family. Also, the shipping was way faster than anticipated even with all this craziness going on with the corona virus! If I could give more than 5 stars I absolutely would!",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"This is a very high-quality action camera. The same thing but GoPro brand is $398.99. this product saved me a lot of money and it is very awesome. It comes with 7 mounts, 2 clips, and 2 helmet mounts if your helmet doesn't already have a mount on it, they are extremely sticky stickers in the bottom of the mount and you just stick it on. There is also a little charger box that you plug a phone charger into and you can insert both rechargeable batteries at once and they charge quickly. Great product and its just as good as GoPro brand.",5,1,2018-8-29,1,1,0

Bought this specifically for my Toyota Tacoma since they come with a factory GoPro mount installed on the inside of the windshield. The camera angle isn’t as wide as I expected but enough to catch whatever is in the proximity it is facing. I’ve never owned a GoPro and this is the first camera I’ve ever purchased so let that speak for itself. But if I ever was to need/want another camera for my truck I wouldn’t have a problem purchasing another one of these.,5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"The camera its self is ok. But they give you a bunch of free stuff to leave a review. The free stuff had a very toxic, super glue smell. And the camera case is not waterproof. Very short battery life. Made in china.",2,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0

"You get what you pay for. Works GREAT for the price but it doesnt compare to gopros, at all. Quality is nice but with such a small aperture low light and indoor is VERY POOR quality even at 1080p.

"Bought this camera a few months ago off Amazon, and for the price, this camera is amazing. While it may not completely measure up to a true GoPro, this is the best bang for your buck. Camera is very light but durable. I have used it under water and outdoors a lot so far for my BoyScout trips. No complaints so far! The screen on the back is extremely convenient and the camera comes with everything you need to get started. While it is debatable whether or not it is ""4K"", I mean come on, it's $85. Definitely would recommend. Totally worth every penny.",5,1,2017-3-19,1,1,0
"The camera arrived on time and with all parts. Previous reviews warned me it was a bit confusing since there are only 5 small instruction pages. However if you read the reviews and research a little online you can find out everything you need. I did not realize a Micro SD card was not included and thank goodness I started playing around a week before my trip so i have time to get it. I agree, if you are trying to get this for a vacation or an event give yourself plenty of time with the camera first.",4,1,2017-11-9,1,0,0
"Hi, few weeks ago  I got my new Akaso Action camera the EK7000, that I'm very happy with. It is well constructed and I like the picture and video quality. I would like to have a couple of screws a little bit longer to attach to my motorcycle easier but so far it's working really good, easy to set up and operate. The water proof case is easy to install in and out.So, I recommend this camera to anybody, even my wife likes to have one to carry in her purse !!",5,1,2019-3-27,1,0,1

It’s also very light and portable, which is exactly what I was looking for!! Highly recommend this product, give it a try!!",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"this camera seems to be made of a cheap plastic but doesn't matter because of the case in which the camera sits in doesn't feel cheap. feels to the same quality as a real go pro which is nice, picture quality is pretty good and the camera is very easy to set up and use right out of the box. Overall I firmly believe this is one of the best budget action cameras to buy for those starting out in making videos with out spending a fortune.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
For the price it’s absolutely worth it! I was surprised the picture quality was excellent. Totally worth getting this instead of a $300 dollar one.

"The camera was a bit smaller than I was expecting.  Once I started using it, the setup, picture quality and features arebeyond what I expected.  There are enough mounting accessories for any use.  The remote control is a great feature to start/stop video and snap pictures with ease.  The battery life seems a bit short, my experience is about an hour but on the plus side two batteries are provided along with a dual usb charger.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,1
"Great product for the price.  I have used it for some basic testing (walking, riding bike) and have no issues or problems with it.  The video and picture quality has been great.  The product is easy to use and the LCD screen makes filming/photographing much easier.  The app that goes along with this product so far has worked great as well - very simple but effective.  NOTE:  I have never owned an action camera of any type so I cannot compare to other brands or models.

Not only does it work great, my son absolutely loves it.  It took a little to figure out (non-tech savvy parents) but once we did my son has been using it daily.  Lots of accessories included, most we haven't tried yet...good quality pictures/video, exactly what son wanted minus the go pro price tag.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
I bought this camera to use on my dual sport motorcycle rides. I have had a couple of GoPros that were probably better cameras but did not last very long. This camera fits all my GoPro mounts and comes with a wide variety of mounts also. Video recording is pretty good although possibly not quite as good as the latest GoPro. But for less than $70 and is a winner in my book.,4,1,2018-4-19,1,0,0
We used this to video manatees underwater. It was an affordable little camera and so we were surprised at how well the pics turned out.

Moreover all the features included, the easy way to use it, the cost has achieved to convince me and now my family is happy to enjoy this amazing product.As I'm convinced by this solution, I recommend you tu use it for your hobbies, holidays and fun moments.

"This is my first action camera and I was a bit skeptical due to the affordability of this product when compared to the price of other action cameras (GoPro). I purchased this for my trip to Hawaii and I was incredibly impressed. The video quality I was able to record while snorkeling was exceptional. I've only used this while swimming, so I can not speak to the quality of using it in other situations, but I'm sure it will be just as impressive. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this camera and I look forward to testing it out in other situations.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
Got this for my 9yr old to track her adventures. Looks nice and comes with a lot of accessories. Doesn’t come with a mini SD card - you will need a 32GB. Charges fast. Instructions could be better-onlyPictures,4,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
The camera comes with a lot of useful accessories. The setup is easy and user-friendly process. The camera works as described in the manual available from the website (make a search with the camera name). The quality of a wide-field images is good to see all details (see attached photo and details of the painted wall outside the picture frame). With the power and memory saving options (I used in the setup) the battery lasts to make a number of video files up to the memory card capacity. The change of a backup battery is easy. I am fully satisfied with this camera.My rate is five stars.,5,1,2019-6-20,1,0,1

This was the first type of camera like this I have ever gotten and it’s a great camera. It is very easy to use and it was very easy to connect to the wifi and get it to connect to my phone. It’s a great camera for beginners and I think the picture quality is really good for the price you’re paying. The only issue I had with this camera was that I couldn’t get one of the screws out of the mount so that I could take the camera off of it. I ended up having to use several screwdrivers until I finally got it off. Otherwise this is a great camera that I will definitely continue to use!,5,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
"This camera is awesome and worth it for the price. I use it for different outdoors activities such as biking (downhill on trails, through NYC [ALL BOROUGHS], and day to day) and hikes.

There was like 15 included hooks, attachments, and extra parts which to me is huge knowing I can take this thing out as soon as possible. Everything seemed to be built well, and I see everything lasting well into the future. When I first bought this camera, I was skeptical yet hopeful. I had really been wanting action camera to record mountain biking, climbing, and skiing but did not want to dish out hundreds of dollars for a Go Pro. After watching my first recorded video which took into account various levels of lighting, distance and close up shots, and varying degrees of motion, I was sold. And each video since this point has been equally impressive. Yes, the company does offer me a free gift for giving this review but I would have put this review up despite this.

The product was actually surprising with the features that it had but it was not advertised. This thing is the best alternative to not spending a fortune trying to capture activities. I have used it on a golf course and while paddleboarding in the ocean. It has worked flawlessly as far as taking video. The only thing that I can say that might be my ignorance is the sound quality but again it was me using it for the first time for two totally different scenarios.

La recibí en el día de ayer y aunque la he trasteado poco aún la presentación me ha sorprendido. Naturalmente no puedo esperar que se comporte como una cámara de 150 dólares, pero sin duda tiene unos acabados de primera fila. Viene además con un buen set de accesorios que le dan versatilidad.

"First off let me say that this action camera is a FANTASTIC camera for the price. I have mounted it to the front of my ATV for taking video of trail rides. I put it in the waterproof case and it endured the snow & mud that we encountered thus far. I have found what works best for my needs is recording video on the 1080p x 60fps settings, with a 32gb micro sd card that I can get about 3 hours of recording time.  The only disappoint I have is the the length of the rechargeable battery life. It didnt seem to last all that long especially in the colder temperatures, however it does come with a second battery so if your willing to change out then your set..

"""Santa"" got this for our 6 year old son for Christmas. Mainly purchased it for its price and what appears to be good durability. Well worth it! All the adults at Christmas ended up playing with it as well. After watching a few YouTube videos, we downloaded the app and can view videos on our phone both as play-back option and live-stream. It also comes with TONS of different attachments and 2 batteries that seem to last quite a while. Great product for the price.",5,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0

The remote works well, still playing with the optional app. The video is good although I do wish we could get bet that 25fps at 4k.

This is my first camera of this kind so I can't comment on the comparison between this one and GoPro, but I could say that I'm satisfied with the image and video quality. The remote control can be left in a pocket or on a strap that can go on the wrist, quite handy. Comes with a ton of accessories that you can use to put the camera on helmets, bike handles, etc. I don't think there's a chest strap tho, you might need to get one of those to go hand free.",5,1,2017-1-13,1,1,0

This is a quality camera for an affordable price. Much better then spending several hundred dollars on a GoPro. We purchased this camera for our 10 year old daughter. She has enjoyed making fun and adventurous videos. The only problem we had was when she took it into the ocean and lost it. She dropped it when she was playing in the waves and since we had no flotation equipment it was gone. So we had to purchase a second one. So my advice is to make sure you have some type of flotation equipment mounted to the camera before going into the ocean.,4,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
I am a youtube content creator and travel with my teens. I purchased this camera to avoid giving my sons my expensive GoPro during action shots on rides and snorkeling and also to have different camera angles for the videos. This camera performed like a charm and you can barely tell the difference between the two cameras in each video. I may purchase one more of these so that both boys have one for their videos when we are separated on our adventures.,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0

"Top Notch Affordable Action Camera Even For BeginnersI am not “tech savvy”, so I was apprehensive of using the Akaso EK7000 Ultra HD 4K camera. My fears were misplaced.  It was super easy to set up right out of the box.  The attachment to my full face snorkel was obvious.  The underwater video was superb on my very first dive.  Plus  I downloaded the 9 minute video wirelessly to my iPad in about 10 minutes.  The still photos were also high quality.  The device is rugged and has mounting adaptors that even a person with no common sense could hook to handle bars, dashboard or helmet.  This beauty will be my regular traveling buddy.",5,1,2018-1-30,1,0,0

I did not like the image quality. My iPhone XS is way better quality for video and picture. I bought for vacation and sadly half the videos didn’t turn out as well.

And I'm not the only one to get the camera-3 charter clients had the same one! The product description is accurate. The features and quality are comparable to higher priced products, and I got great, useful gear. All of which is compact, easy to use and truly waterproof. I do remove the camera from the case and air dry it. I also use dialectic grease on the cases metal screw fixtures because they did show slight corrosion. If the case doesn't fair well, I will ask for a replacement. All fixtures should be stainless steal.

"Update: Akaso reached out and replaced the camera with the newer V50 model.  I have used it several times and it appears to be better constructed and held up to the it the few uses that we have put it through to this point.  It always nice to have a manufacture respond and try to improve the experience of the users of their equipment.The video quality is acceptable, and the camera is easy enough to use.  On mine the down button sunk into the camera making it impossible to press the button.  This occurred after about four or five uses of the camera. Losing the ability to use the down button means that you can no longer access the Wi-Fi mode. Without Wi-Fi mode you cannot set the time on the camera, nor can you take advantage of the phone app.  Know that you are not purchasing a device with a high build quality.  You are getting exactly what you paid for, a disposable low end action camera, it is not built to last.",2,1,2018-2-18,1,0,0
Great little camera so far.  I have had a GoPro before and this camera is not quite as nice structurally but it is comparable and at a fraction of the price. I will probably be purchasing a second in the near future.Pros,5,1,2017-1-29,1,1,0

This part of the menu is stuck on 1080p 30 and won't change either in the app or on the camera's menu itself. I disconnected from wifi and even took out the battery for 30s to see if once I put it back and turn it on, it'll be back to normal. No success, still stuck. I did a reset and still stuck.

As a camera that performed as I would expect however the waterproof case had a broken tab the instructions were horrible and after I figured it out the phone app constantly crashed and never did work you would have to go through a lot of effort to display a video on your TV considering the connection process to be fair there was lots of accessories which was good and the camera itself performs as expected,4,1,2017-9-23,1,0,0

From the initial experience, I think this could easily rival other top-tier action cameras in all aspects. Not to say that the accessories are also complete, and if you wish to get more, you can do so at still a much better bargain that the competitors. Money well spent! 👌",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0

It was a cheaper alternative to getting a GoPro, but that being said. Cheaper products are not necessarily always a good thing. The side button on this thing broke on our very first use.

This is the worst action camera I could've purchased. I bought this a few days before my family vacation and it constantly kept turning off ever few minutes. I missed key moments of my family's life because I chose not spend additional money on a more quality camera.It got even worst I went on a sight seeing adventure and got up close to bears with my camera turned on and a few secs later the camera continue to turn off.

I am having issues with this camera out of the box: It freezes 9 out of 10 times when recording. There is no other way to reset other than taking the battery out. It is not practical when you are snorkeling. The only way around this is to keep filming without every pausing/stopping. Not sure what to do. I will use another set of cards to check if the card is the culprit but this is a fast card that I use on other cameras filming at higher resolution and frame rate combination. Chances are I will end up returning this camera if it keeps failing/freezing during normal usage.,2,1,2017-8-11,1,0,0
Reasonably priced action camera. The SD card makes a difference.  4k video requires a name.brand high speed card. The instructions are a bit turbid but understandable.

"For the money there should be no complaints with this camera. The video quality is very good, the audio quality is decent (for those complaing about the sound while in the waterproof case, they need to replace the backdoor with the vented one), and the accessories that come with it are very versatile. In 4k the video is slightly choppy (could be because I'm viewing on a 1080p screen), but other then that everything else is great. I'm using a 64GB Sandisk Class 10. I do wish the waterproof housing was designed in a way to protect the lens portion (currently is flat and can be scratched if dropped), but replacement cases are less then $15 so it's not a big deal.",5,1,2017-1-12,1,1,0
"I was browsing to purchase a small, compact, water proof camera for my family and I. Got lucked out and came across this camera. We often go fishing and camping by the river. I always like to take pictures for our memories. As you can imagine, walking down the river while holding our fishing poles and trying to take pictures at the same time can be tough also risking dropping the phone in the river. So this camera is perfect! Takes great pictures and water proof, best of all has all the accessories you need to have the best experience.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"Tested it out and the kids love the camera already!  Originally, I was going to buy the more expensive GoPro model, but when I saw that over 300, I went to look around for another brand for kids.  Glad I found this brand.  Great value for 1/4 to 1/5 the price!Already charging it again (includes the charger and 2 batteries!) as I used it all day long.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,1

"Got this as a gift for my cousin that is in China with her high-school senior class and she loves it.  The pictures she has uploaded look amazing, crisp, clear, sharp, and with incredible color saturation.  She loves the LCD screen, it is genius, it makes it really easy for her to take pictures and the chest harness that we bought her separately lets her share the experience with us without distracting her from taking it all-in in real life.",5,1,2017-4-12,1,0,0

"At first this worked really well, but after a few weeks of use, the camera locks up when powered up and sticks on the start up logo and will not go to the camera screen.  The battery for the camera needs to be removed, reinstalled then powered back on for it to work.  Not something you want to do when you are already in the water snorkeling!  If the return window hadn't passed while I was on vacation, I would return this.",2,1,2018-1-5,1,1,0
"Ive never owned a camera like this before, so I don't really have anything to compare it with but I LOVE the camera.  Especially for the price.  I purchased this right before Summer because we had a few trips I really wanted to use a multi-purpose/ underwater camera with.  Great quality video.  The waterproof box works great.  Unfortunately, I had taken the remote snorkeling with us and ruined the remote  (NOTE: remote is ""water resistant"" NOT waterproof.  Which is clearly stated in the instructions.  I'm just an idiot).  I contacted  Akaso customer service and they worked with me to replace my remote.  They were super easy to deal with and attentive.  I would absolutely buy this camera again.",5,1,2018-1-26,1,0,0
"I am planning a vacation cruise this coming summer and wanted an action camera to document my travel.  After exploring the numerous options, I decided on the Akaso EK7000.  The economical price of this camera compared to others is what initially caught my attention.  The numerous features and included accessories are what closed the deal for me.After having a chance to use and explore what this camera can do, I am very satisfied with the video and picture quality.  It would be nice if there was an option to using an external microphone.  All in all, I am very satisfied with this  camera and look forward to using it on my future trip.",5,1,2019-1-30,1,0,0

"This action camera is great!  I wanted a GoPro, but didn't want to spend over $400 so I thought I would give this a try.  This little camera is well made and performs very well for the price.  We have used it in the pool several times now and had no problems at all.  Comes with many accessories and is easy to use.  Battery life isn't very long, but that is to be expected in such a small camera.  The app that goes along with it for android works fine, a little buggy, but gets the job done.  I have recommended this camera to all of my friends because it works so well and costs so little.",5,1,2017-8-9,1,1,0

"Works amazing! We bought one for our honeymoon cruise and we love it. The camera takes great pictures, the plastic casing works great not one drop of moisture inside. All the attachments are cool too. If using underwater though I would recommend getting a red filter, one thing that didn't come in the pack that we probably could have used but pictures were still good just really blue. Really recommend especially if you don't want to spend the high price for a gopro",5,1,2017-6-5,1,2,0
"Very good camera. I was a bit skeptical about the quality for such a low price but it works well and is very comparable to the other well known big namePro camera. I haven't used it on my motorcycle yet, which is why I purchased it but for videos I have taken it's done a great job. For some reason it breaks up longer videos into shorter multiple videos. Not sure it's the camera or using a 64G sd card",4,1,2017-4-3,1,1,0
Way over sharpened video with no apparent way to reduce it. Okay for a junk camera but no way near a GoPro in quality. If I could reduce the sharpening I might rate this better.Update: Great customer service. They sent me a new one for free and seems to be a little better.,5,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
"Love it so far. Even took it with me for a test ride on my motorcycle and caught my first crash video when I wiped out in mud. Impressive resolution, and the interface has been fairly intuitive.  Got the extended protection plan through Amazon, we'll see how it holds up over time.",5,1,2017-12-27,1,1,0
"The audio leaves a lot to be desired. It's not super clear and sounds a little distant. The water proof box eliminates sound which is natural do to the box you put it in, but I would like to hear the burbling sound of water. For the price though, it's not bad.",4,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"I have never used any of these type of cameras before, I bought it to record my daughters softball games and practices. It worked really well for the low price and very easy to use.I did buy a 256gb memory card for it and seemed to have trouble using that. It wouldn’t record for more than 5-10 min, it also would show a memory card error. I then jumped down to a 128gb mem card and it worked and recorded very well. The sound was very faint unless you were standing next to it.",4,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"After doing some homework, reading the reviews and having experience with the GoPro, I opted for the Akaso. I am very pleased with the purchase and the capabilities of this action camera. It more than meets my expectations and is comparable to the GoPro on all fronts. Excellent product and an amazing price. Set up was simple as well as connecting the wifi to the app on my iPhone 7. It comes with a good variety of accessories, and additional accessories are cheap and easy to get. Great product all around.

"This camera is such a great alternative to GoPro.  I don't like buying mainstream stuff but the problem with doing that is sometimes you get bad quality stuff.

I like the size and weight of camera. I found it confusing with all the accessories included but no information what they are used for. YouTube helped a lot so that's what I would suggest.

"I bought this camera for my son and it turned out to be really good. It says it has 4K quality but it only went up to 1080p but it still looked like it was 4K. The battery lasted pretty long and it also didn't take much time to charge. I love all the accessories. I also found it very useful to have an extra battery. Something else that I love about it is that it comes with a remote and wifi. Also with the instructions you get a card giving you the choice to either claim an sd card, extra batteries and charger, or an accessory bundle. I found that very cool. The recording quality is not 4K as it said but it is still very good with 1080P. The picture quality is VERY GOOD. I will leave a picture taken by my camera down below.",5,1,2018-1-10,1,1,1

Everything worked great 80% of the time. The video quality was great when it worked but It seemed to freeze intermittantly when switching from standby mode to video mode. The only way to unfreeze camera was to to pull the battery out. I used this to scuba dive and to un freeze the camera as u can imagine in the water with wet hands while floating on the surface was extremely inconvenient (impossible). I missed some great footage. I'm going to be sending it back and getting a Gopro.,2,1,2017-1-23,1,1,0
This action camera comes with every accessory you can imagine.  Everything is very solid and works as advertised.  I use the camera on my road bike and can get 2 hours of use on one battery and the video quality is perfect.  I get about 4 hours of video on one 32GB micro SD  card.  I highly recommend this camera and other Akaso products because I haven't been disappointed yet.,5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0

Just got it and have been messing around. Picture quality is amazing and has been very user friendly in figuring out. For what we needed guidance on we found easily through the online manual. The app to download is as user friendly and is very helpful. It allows full control of the camera as well as the settings! Can't wait to use it for the first time! Will it be my husband on his pontoon or me on my paddle board!? With all the included accessories for mounting makes that easy as well!,5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
I got this product yesterday and already  love it. Really great video and picture quality. Super easy to use the Wi-Fi feature and also easy to set up.The battery lasts long and the package come with everything it needs and more so good quality for the price. I recommend 1080p @60 FPS settings. I cant wait to start my adventure and capture the amazing moments.,5,1,2017-9-1,1,1,1
Comes with every attachment needed to get the best pictures.  I have not used this underwater yet. Only issue is the tab for battery case (battery cover) and sd card is not anchored to camera so i feel like i will eventually lose it,5,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0

"This is my first time owning an action camera, I originally started looking at Gopros but was not a fan of the price for a first time camera. So I went on Amazon and came across this one. Overall all I am pleased with this camera and you cannot beat the price. I was a little skeptical because of how inexpensive it was but to be honest it gets the job done. The camera and case are very sturdy and set up wasn't difficult at all. Only negative I came across was the battery life and the sound quality could be a bit better but that was not a deal breaker for me. I will definitely be ordering more.",4,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0
Love the video quality of the camera. Fairly easy to setup and use. Jury still out on the WiFi portion. Only addition I would like to see is a zoom feature. Battery door could be designed a little better. I could see where it might break after multiple uses . Otherwise great value for the cost.,4,1,2018-11-12,1,0,0
"Not 4k in any way.  Only has the option for 1080p and 720p. Though it says 4k all over it.That said,  it's  full hd cam that's got ease of use and great picture. Just don't expect anything above 1080p30fps",1,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
Can't go wrong with the action camera.  The high number of reviews and stars speak for themselves.  It is a great camera.  1080P on 60 fps shoot great video.  The waterproof case works well also.  Can't recommend this camera enough.,5,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0
"Small, simple, easy to use with a ton of accessories. If you're like me, and not sure how much you'll truly use an action camera as such, this is a great starting point.

"We have vacationed and done many activities that would benefit from an action camera like snorkeling, zip lining, parasailing, etc. However, we didn't have one and were nervous to take our phones with us for fear they would be lost, broken or stolen, so we sadly missed out on capturing many of those experiences. This product is perfect for what we needed! It takes great quality photo and video and can pretty much be taken anywhere and comes with accessories to safely mount. The best part is if something were to unfortunately happen to it while we are traveling we aren't out much money and they are so affordable everyone can have one to record their own experience.",5,1,2018-1-7,1,1,0
This is a great action camera for the price. Pretty easy to set up also. I formatted my sd card and started taking videos right away. My Chromebook accepts a micro sd card so it was very easy to pop it out of the camera and into my chromebook to view my videos. Lots of accessories come with the camera and my daughter is excited to use the waterproof case to shoot videos under water.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an action camera.,4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0

I got this camera from my parents for my birthdayI'd say it is a pretty good camera I put it on my dirt bike and the video was good and easy to watch one problem I had with it though is When I was swimming in the lake with it the battery died and didn't save the footage another problem that's not that big of a deal but it comes with a lot of part and I couldn't figure out what they were for or how to use them.

"At first the camera seemed like it was going to be great. Lots of parts to use it in different ways. During the first week of my son using the camera, it became difficult for him to turn it off. The on/off button wouldn't do the trick so unbeknownst to me he would just leave it on and let the battery die. He'd be able to recharge and use for a bit before the same on/off button wouldn't work again. It's finally at a point where it just doesn't work any longer and I am unable to return. I should have paid better attention to what was happening so I found gave returned or replaced it.",2,1,2017-12-27,1,0,0

We bought this camera for an upcoming trip that involved a lot of outdoor activities. We wanted something that could get wet and potentially even get dropped with little to no damage.Overall we are very happy with the product especially for the price!

"The camera’s controls are pretty easy to use. No complaints on the quality of the footage other than the fact that some of the burst shots were a bit blurry. The included foot is a little wobbly but still does its job. The bike mount fits onto every handlebar I’ve tried it on (can’t guarantee it fits all handlebars, though). All and all it is better than what is expected from an average $50 camera. (This is the first action camera I have ever used so for all I know it could be better than a $300 GoPro.)",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0

I'm pretty impressed with this camera for the price. It takes pretty descent photos and videos as well. Its definitely not a go pro but for the price difference it's a good starting action cam. I purchased this with the intent to record while fishing but I plan to use it for much more now. I am using a samsung evo 128gb micro sd card and it works perfectly with this camera.

Looking forward to taking it on vacation in two weeks.This things comes with a ton of accessories, however be aware it does not come with a simple wrist tether....but that is just a 5 dollar add on. Totally worth it for the value you get with this camera.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
The quality of the video and the number of accessories you get at this price is amazing. The kit includes two separate batteries so that you can charge the second one while using the first and then immediately use the second one if the fist gets discharged.I haven't had any issues with the connection and setup. You could easily connect to your phone over Wifi and get a live feed from the camera. You get roughly around 50 minutes of video record time on a single battery. I must recommend this to anyone who is looking for an affordable sports camera.,5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0

"I've never taken the time to write a review until now. Perhaps I got a lemon, because I don't understand why this camera is rated so highly. From day one, I had it issues with it turning itself off even though the batteries were fully charged. It was also getting quite hot to the touch when this was happening. I've tried using external power without the batteries, but the camera still unpredictably shuts itself off within one to a few minutes of use. I got so frustrated with it, that I smashed it with a hammer for cathartic release.",1,1,2017-10-2,1,2,0

The images were very clear and turned out great. I read other reviews and purchased an external flash.

"This camera although good and incredible for the price is not as good in some aspects when compared to the Gopro. The image is more contrasty than the Gopro so in shadows you lose some detail. The colors seem a bit saturated and produce a less realistic image. This can be changed with an editor if you really need to, but not the loss of shadow detail. Build quality is good especially when you take into account the price. and the LCD screen on the back makes everything a lot easier such as settings and actually being able to see what you are filming. After a month of hard use I definitely recommend this camera. If you want to see a side by side comparison, go to youtube and seach ""Photojunky Drone Zone"" .",5,1,2017-1-25,1,2,0

The card that Amazon recommended (64 Gig) wont work. The maximum that the camera can handle is 32 Gig. Don't make the same mistake I did. The app works great except that you have to switch off of your home network to use your device with the camera's WIFI. If it could connect to the camera and home network at the same time, it would be even better.You get load of accessories with this camera. Everything you could think of except a carrying case and tripod.",4,1,2017-12-25,1,0,0
"So far it’s awesome for the price. I’m not a photographer, just a typical person with a camera who has no clue what they’re doing when trying to edit. That said, I’ve had a GoPro hero 4, and so far, this camera does just as well if not better. Again, I’m no pro, just raw footage sent to my phone for uploading to social media etc. Can’t say how well it does for the pros, but for everyday propel, wanting a cheaper alternative....this is the one to get.",5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
"Purchased this for my husband for a dashcam which he uses and it works great, but we ended up having a vacation scheduled and brought it for a underwater camera. It has adapters that allowed us to attach to our snorkel masks. Worked great and we got lots of great videos of the fish and the reefs.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"Good video but hard to use and batteries drain fast.  Good for the price,  my problem was I needed to keep it in the case to protect from dusty conditions but needed to be hardwired for any extended use (batteries died fast). Customer service was great,  responded to my review and worked to remedy issues.",4,1,2018-9-23,1,0,0
I am SO excited about this camera. The price is great especially compared to name brand cameras. I took it out immediately and filmed some footage of a SUP trip and it looked great.,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He wanted it to use for shooting video for his Youtube channel.  So far he seems happy with it and the video quality is excellent.  A great little camera for the price.  I cannot believe how much cheaper it is vs the leader in the action camera field.,5,1,2018-1-1,1,1,0
So far this Camera has exceeded my expectations!!  I love the ease of use the picture quality is better than I expected.  The wifi is a plus being able to use your phone to control the cam is a nice feature.  Overall for the money you pay for this and the better known camera this camera matches the performance of that unit.  Packaging was great all documentation was included although it may be a little date for this particular camera it was there is nothing to download except the software.  All in all I would recommend this camera to anybody I cannot wait to take it on my next cruise.Hope this helps your decision on which cam to buy and you can save a ton of money to spend on accessories...,5,1,2016-10-10,1,2,0
"Purchased this to film family white water rafting trip.  It came with a ton of attachments for all manner of helmets, bike handles, etc.  The camera takes 4k video and 12mp pictures wide angle and does it with a wrist remote.Couldn't be more pleased.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0

"This is my first camera used for underwater footage and it works great. For the price I would say this is well worth it, it comes with different mounts and a remote control! One thing that I noticed was that if the video recorded for one minute, the screen would turn off but would still record. Turns out all you do is have to press any button and it will turn on and still be recording. The battery life is pretty long and I would say that this is probably as good as a GoPro.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I love what this camera can do. I'm just getting started using it. It's long on features and capabilities, but for me a little short on instructions. I may be over complicating things a bit. I would like to see more how to's about this camera. Additionally, I'd like to use it to record speeches I'm giving for class. Does anyone know of a wireless headset that transmits well with this camera? All in all great value in hardware, though you have to do some of the figuring out for yourself.",5,1,2017-1-20,1,1,0
This camera is amazing!! I bought this just days before leaving to go out of the country. I took this camera with me kayaking and swimming. Some activities we did you were not allowed to take your phone so this was perfect. It took great pictures in the water and not. Even better I was able to upload my pictures to my phone without having to use a laptop. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a go pro but can't spend the money for one.,5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"The AKASO EK7000 4K WIFI Sports Action Camera is not bad at all. Results have been good. Initially I could not get the camera to connect to the recommended app called EZ Cam, as they suggest in the little book that comes with the camera. I went back to the product listing here and saw that you should use the iSmart DV app. I installed iSmart DV app on my iPhone and it connected with zero problems and works great! I also own a GoPro Hero5 Black, GoPro Hero2, and an APEMAN Action Camera FHD 1080P WiFi. The AKASO EK7000 and Apeman cameras are not GoPro Hero5 Blacks. However, they are very good cameras for general use. I've been a professional photographer/film maker for 40 years and have relied on GoPro-type cameras since they arrived on the market. Make sure if you get one, purchase a top-of-the-line ultra-fast card for it. Again - the AKASO EK7000 4K WIFI Sports Action Camera is a very good camera and the build quality is very good. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone that is wanting a good action camera with WIFI and good quality imaging.",4,1,2017-2-22,1,5,0
Case is sturdy and the camera works great. Be sure to read the instructions as it explains how to navigate the camera options. I used this camera in the Bahamas and it worked great under water! The case attached to all my go pro accessories. Perfect for traveling! Works the same as a go pro for a significantly lower cost!,5,1,2018-10-8,1,0,0
"I was a bit disappointed when the camera arrived without a SD card, but I was so exited about finding the product in amazon I didn’t read all the information. However my disappointment quickly faded when I found the “share your experience” note that offered a free card and more accessories which is amazing since it already came with so many, to write a review. I can’t wait to write one after I’ve actually used the device, because if it’s half as good as the fantastic customer initiatives offered, I KNOW I’m going to LOVE IT!!!!",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Great (nopro) alternate at a fraction of the cost. So far picture quality is great, the frames seem a bit choppy on my PC once downloaded, I might have to play with the file or adjust on my video editor. They record in mov. Files so I'll likely just need to convert or have the correct player.Pros: great quality, price, etc",4,1,2017-3-3,1,1,0
"Great camera for the price - small, lightweight, comes with 2 batteries and many accessories. Recording video at 1080p is very good but 4K is disappointing. I found recording at 4K or even 2.7K was quite glitchy. So if you all you need is to record at 1080p, then this camera is hard to beat at its price.",4,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"So glad I went with this camera!  I was right there, gonna spend 6x as much and figured to try AKASO since all in $75.  I was concerned about no stabilization but after buying a chest strap/holder the video look great - even on the worse single track Mt bike trials.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"Camera is really small. Sound is horrible when in the case. Makes it sound muffled and like its under water but without sounds ok. But you need the case to mount it anywhere. No instructions,  you have to scan a barcode to get any direction. And make sure you buy whatever SD card they say. I gave 5 stars because although the camera wasn't what I needed the customer service went above and beyond to make sure no matter what I was happy.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

"I had a GoPro and lost it, and decided on the AKASO due to price and the positive reviews. It looks exactly like my old GoPro and comes with several attachments as well! For the value it’s a good deal - for basic photos and for when traveling.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,1
This is a great hunting camera. We took it pheasant hunting and got some great video. We still have to edit it.The con of this is that you can’t see if your video is pointing in the correct place until you review it.

The remote it’s definitely a plus on this one. I have tried the camera myself on our camping trips and it works smoothly. I wasn’t so sure when I purchased it but now I know I made the best decision. Cheers!",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"I bought this for my son for Christmas, and he absolutely loves it. He finally gets to record himself when he rides his bike, snowboards, and water boards. He's most excited that it is waterproof and he can take it under water with him. The only downside, is that it comes with a lot of pieces. That can be overwhelming for a kid, let alone a parent. But we downloaded the manual and it was pretty easy to put together and figure out how to mount it on his helmet. Overall, this is a great product.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"This is a great camera for the action-minded person! And the price point sold me. No need to spend 2-3 times more for a GoPro. We used it on a recent trip to Hawaii and it worked well. The waterproof case works as advertised and it's fairly easy to operate. My only challenge is getting the wi-fi to work, I've tried several times and can't get it to connect.Still need to mount the attachment so I can put it on the handlebars of my bike. And, I love the remote wristband, makes it much easier and safer to operate. Being not super technologically-inclined, I've found the sequence of buttons a bit daunting for me to figure out!",4,1,2018-2-4,1,0,0
The Camera is very cool it take real neat pictures and very versitile. My Girlfriend love it. I also will buy a second one to vlog my bee keeping ventures.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,1
It arrived the day before I went on a cave exploration just in time. I used the included accessories to mount it to my helmet and was ready to rock! It got banged around a lot but the mount held FIRM. The included two batteries are great! I had one charging while using the other and during the whole 4 hour expedition I only had to swap the battery once. I haven't had time to look at the footage yet but from what I can tell by using the remote viewing app....I'm impressed!!!,5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"I am very amazed with this camera, especially since the price is so  low.  I mainly use it to record while i go off roading. and it takes real good video.

The camera is very easy to use it only took me a few minutes to figure out the menu system and how to change all the settings.",5,1,2017-3-19,1,1,0

I liked it because the camera quality is really good and it’s nice and small so it can fit any where it was a little difficult to connect it to the WiFi but all you need is the password which is 1234567890 and it should connect you to it it was rlly nice and Easy to put the bundles on and it has great camera quality under water I recommend it.,5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I received the camera on time. I used the camera several times and it worked great. The only 2 negative parts about the camera is that after extended use, the camera gets extremely hot and the battery life is not 90 minutes I got 30 minutes per battery. Other than that the camera is a AWESOME DEAL!!! I  thought which should I get a  Go Pro or  the Akaso , But the prices made the difference in my decision. Under $90 for a Action Camera verses a few hundred dollars. I recommended this camera to my friends and they all ordered it. The one feature I like most is the wrist control. It makes taking action clips or photos a lot personal. to control at a push of a button to capture life's greatest moments. I really like my Akaso EK7000. I also can control all functions on my cell phone once it is connected to Wi-Fi. This Action Camera is a great buy.",5,1,2017-4-29,1,0,0
"For a beginner this is a wonderful set. I was impressed with the variety of peripherals that came with it and, while not the best, the battery life is suitable. This is a great tool for learning how to shoot various videos and its size and stuffiness ensures that it can last. I think this will eventually be upgraded and when I do I will look into the Akasp line.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"On the surface...I thought this produce would be a alternative to a GoPro (tm). Not so. The accessory package was the best part of the item, although the self sticking mounts don't stick, so plan on buying command strips or something else to use to adhere the mounts. Additionally, the batteries don't last more than a 20 minutes and in the cold, maybe shorter.  I even tried to use the camera as a dashcam and plug the camera into the accessory charging slot. It worked for a short time but it seems the camera uses more juice than what is being replaced by the charger. 1 hour tops and your done.  Buy accordingly.",2,1,2017-1-7,1,1,0
My original purchase came in damaged so I returned it.  The replacement came perfectly packaged and had more pieces then the first order.  Which makes me wonder if I was originally sent a returned item.  But the camera works great and is a great (cheaper) alternative to the GroPro.

No issues with water resistance. The app that goes with the product is pretty bad but we didn't care. Looked at all our videos connected to laptop at end of day and were thrilled with what we were able to capture.  Overall picture quality very good.

I bought this product to video tape patients (wearing device on my head) and use footage for lecturing.  Easy to learn how to use and was able to manipulate footage with computer software in a short period of time for high quality videos to present in Power Point lecture.  Had bought another product that was more expensive and did not compare in ease of use.  Extremely impressed and cannot go wrong with pricing.  A bonus is that you get several different attachments to use for various set-ups.,5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0

Overall price still lower than just buying a bigger brand name camera alone. I would give it 5 stars but she hasn't used it enough for me to say for sure how it holds up over time. But we are very pleased so far!",4,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
The AKASO EK7000 is one heck of a camera at a great price. I’ve only had mine a few days but already gotten great use while biking and kayaking.

The provided clips and waterproof case are a great start and fully rounded out by the mounting accessory option.I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking to chronicle their adventures who doesn’t want to sell a leg to get it.,5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I have bought this camera for capturing skiing, roller-coasting, biking, under-water swimming activities.  It works well for all of these.

The AKASO EK7000 has been a wonderful addition to my newly growing collection of cameras. I wasn't about to drop hundreds of dollars on a big name action camera and the positive reviews of the AKASO led me back to it over and over again while I was searching through the many options online. The videos from this camera look great (I only bother with 1080p video...I have no desire to mess with any higher resolutions at this point in time). The photos are fine but I don't see myself needing this for still shots. The accessories that the camera comes with makes it easy to use it anywhere you might need and the ability to connect to a smartphone through an app is super convenient for starting/stopping the video recording as well as setting up a frame since you can view the camera's video live from your phone. This is a great product with great value,5,1,2017-2-20,1,1,0
"I purchased this to record my travels and outdoor activities. I also have been enjoying the time lapse shots to add some different shots to my videos. I mainly work in 1080 60fps and this has been ideal. I have only shot a little footage in the 4K format, but not really worked with it yet. I started with a 16GB micro SD card which only allows the 720 60fps and 1080 30fps settings. I switched to a 64GB micro SD card that allows all formats. The pictures are nice a clear excellent burst shots and time lapse. Good price point for a fun little action cam.",5,1,2017-1-10,1,3,1

I am not too happy with the stabilization of the camera for videos but personally I am not really interested in upgrading at the moment so for the price it suits my needs!

He also looked at youtube videos on how to use it.  It has a built in Wifi + HDMI, a waterproof case, helmet mounts, handlebar supports, as well as adhesive mounts for multiple surfaces.  It has a lot of functions such as time lapse video, video mode, burst photo mode, still photos, and other trinkets not yet explored!!!  Sadly, it didn't come with a SD Card but we had one on hand.

Product works very well. Comes as described. Image stabilization is not the best but you cannot expect a $400 go pro for $60 either. The fact that it comes with two batteries is amazing. It even comes with a separate dual battery charger so you don't have to charge using the camera. I happen to have plenty of mounts but if this is your first camera it is so cool to be able to mount it on something immediately and start to record. The batteries even had a partial charge in them. Happy enough to where I am ordering one of their V50 Elite at $140 it also seems like quite the bargain for the specs.,5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,0

I honestly doubted this camera quality because of the low price. Trust me, it is worth much more than what it costs.",5,1,2016-10-30,1,2,0
He camera and assocories you get at this price point is amazing. The video and audio quality is on par or better than any of the other cameras I have tried. Love that this even has a rear screen. Packaging and instructions were great. Keep up the good work on the tiny little wonder of an action cam.  Off to shoot some runs down the ski slope. Yeah for winter.,5,1,2017-1-13,1,1,0
"Definitely worth buying! I bought this camera to use while I’m traveling and doing active things like zip lining, rafting, etc. I especially love how great of quality the photos turn out even when I have clearly been shaking or moving the camera while in motion! It comes with so many accessories as other cameras do not! It does not come with a micro SD card just an FYI.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"Amazing quality for the price.  The sheer amount of included accessories is staggering, and you get 2 batteries AND charger.  I use this camera for scuba diving, and like the peace of mind that if something happens and I lose the camera, I'm not crying over a $500 camera.  Also, the premium price on other action cameras with a small subjective quality increase is, in my personal opinion not even close to worth it.  Look on youtube for examples of this cameras output.  For a non-photographer who just wants to show people cool things on a dive, this camera gets it done far better than I was expecting.  I am considering buying another one to have as a backup.",5,1,2018-1-31,1,0,0

"For $50 lightning deal, it does everything you need it to do. For action sports, I'd rather buy 3 of these and set up multiple angles then drop $200+ on a GoPro. It all comes down to what you use it for. If you need perfect video quality with image stabilization, save for the GoPro. If you need a camera for capturing weekend warrior activities, this is perfect.",5,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0

The second day I just made sure to turn it off after I got the shots I wanted, then back on, so forth.",4,1,2017-2-24,1,1,0
This is a good action camera/recorder especially since it is a reasonable price.  You won't notice a difference between this and a gopro because gopros try to rob their customers by being unnecessarily expensive.  This is exactly what you want while still reasonably priced.,5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0

"I was extremely impressed with this product.  Bought it for a trip to the Galapagos Islands because it was affordable and if it wasn't good, I hadn't lost that much money.  It was 1/4 the price of the equivalent Go-Pro.  Pictures were great even in murky water and couldn't tell any difference between the go-pro shots in the group and the Akaso shots.  Simple instructions.  The only problem I had was remembering to click past the movie part to get to the still picture setting, but that was not the camera's problem but user incompetence.  Also had some random movies because I had it on movie setting thinking it was on picture so I didn't turn it off.  The provided extra battery was a very useful perk. Glad I bought it!",5,1,2017-2-3,1,1,0

The battery seems to die fast when recording sready. Great thing is you get 2 batteries and you can buy 3 more for 13.99 and up... Overall I would recommend this action camera to anyone looking for an inexpensive high quality action camera.,4,1,2017-10-18,1,0,1
A little disappointed in the product. For one they send a bribe with the product asking for positive feedback in return you get free accessories. So that could be the reason for all the high ratings. Wi-fi was the biggest reason I chose this cam and it's useless. The app for the camera doesn't work and there is no other app that will work. Id give a higher rating if this was fixed but right now I'm not happy at all with this purchase.,2,1,2017-3-2,1,0,0
We use to record videos for my daughter and this is her favorite  toy now. She uses the remote to record her own videos.  Tons of accessories to fit this camera anywhere you like. the extra battery definitely helps.Overall the battery life span isnt much.,5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
Very Impressed. I bought this with a ton of skepticism the first time and was blown away. The picture quality was on par with m friends go pro which he spent 3 times the amount on. The battery life could be better but with the inclusion of the second battery it was fine. Buying it again cause I was reckless and lost my first but it is a great product.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

I bought this little camera for a couple reasons.  I am using it as a dash cam for my daily commute and I also find it useful for taking videos of my kids.An added benefit is that it is smaller than I expected.

"The video itself is great. Everything works really well with it, except the batteries last maybe 2 hours if that! That is when you are recording a video the entire time.

It also would get moisture inside the waterproof case.",1,1,2019-6-23,1,0,0
"This camera has worked perfectly as a helmet-mounted ""dash"" cam for my motorcycle. Battery life is good and at FHD 60 fps it can record for about 2 hrs before needing battery swap.

"I was a little skeptical about this camera but i was completely wrong. It is amazing. I ride horses and i love to capture my trail rides and outdoor arena work. I didn't know how the quality would stand up with the changes in light from riding in a sunny arena to woody trail rides but it was fantastic. I love this little camera. The video quality is amazing as well. The HD quality was shocking, it was so clear and crisp. It is very easy and simple to use. It charges insanely fast and it hasnt died on me and I have use it quite often. I use a mount on my riding helmet and there was no shakiness or unwanted noises when i edited the video.

"I purchased this to capture my daughter's volleyball games and it works great. The wide angle lens allows you to place this almost anywhere and still get a great shot of the action. I was looking at GoPro's, but they are on the high end of my budget. For what I paid, this is an amazing little camera. I use a 64 gig sandisk and it gives me plenty of storage for video. I haven't taken many pictures with it, but the video/audio is great. The remote on/off feature is nice too. My only complaint is that the ""wifi"" APP is not reliable at all. It will connect, but only for a few seconds at best.",5,1,2017-1-22,1,1,0
Unit arrived neatly packaged with all contents. Upon opening I discovered the clear plastic protective housing around the camera had a massive crack right across the lens which pretty much means my camera is now useless.

The reason this product have good rating because they send you frew battery if you give them posative feedback.This product is garbage .mic audio recording is pathetic .battery goes down very fast when video recording.video quality is ok .i climbed up a mountain and record my video and when i play it on laptop i cant hear any audio at all from the recording.,1,1,2018-1-31,1,1,0

"I recently upgraded from a cheaper model because I wanted the features that the AD7000 offers. I'm not sorry! I spent all day yesterday using the video, time-lapse, and camera modes and had a ball. The camera is easy to operate, and with all the excellent connection accessories, it's easy to put it wherever I want. The video quality is very good, even in low light; same with the time-lapse function. What really blows me away is the quality of the still photos I took in the camera mode. I printed 9 photos from inside buildings (hence often low light and always tungston or florescent color). The camera was set of ""auto"" white balance which I did by using my WiFi/tablet connection. I made only one adjustment: noise reduction, because the photos were noisy due to the low light conditions.

Finding the correct positioning of camera while wearing the headband took a little trial and error.  The only negative thing I can say is that the manual is limited in explanation how to use all of the camera's functions and the font is too small, at least for Seniors, even while wearing reading glasses.

"I ordered to action camera to recording training videos on how to operate machinery in my laboratory. Due to COVID, it is difficult for new hires to learn how to operate the machines without them being in the lab physically. The camera allows for me to record the process and it does so in a good quality. It does record sound fairly well too. I don't plan to use the camera for other things but if you plan to use to record stuff like this I do recommend it.",4,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"I have two boys age 9 and 6. As all the kids at that age, they are both very active, and surprisingly enough, this camera lasts pretty long with them making action videos. We have used it to capture great family memories in water, mountain biking, skiing...and the quality of the  picture is awesome. When used in the water, the sound is muted due to the hermetical box, but when i put the videos together adding my own music in the background, it all turns out pretty awesome.We are first time users and i think we will stick to AKASO with the next purchase.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,1

"It's pretty good.  As good as it's going to get for under $100.  The glass for the lense is not super good quality.  One of the mounts don't fit right, so it won't completely seat into it.  Therefore, I'm stuck using the water proof case; and, had to remover the protective lens off to get good resolution.",3,1,2017-4-30,1,1,0
We ordered this for our active 10 year old. So far he's used it during a Nerf war and on the slip and slide. He knows to be careful but he is still 10! - I'd say durability is good. Images came out nice. Definitely worth it for a 10 year old!The screen is small so it's trickier to take a traditional photo (compared to my phone screen). But definitely do-able (I snapped a few extra pics in case I moved and one was blurry).,5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0

"This is great in my opinion. Still have to get the right angle on my helmet. Remote works good. Lots of mounting hardware. Still need to work out some bugs but it is my error, not the unit. Comparable to go pro hero 4 or 5 I think. I have only used the 1080 setting. Will try 2.5 and 4k soon. Battery runs low fast in cold conditions but it does tell you what temps you should use it at. Very pleased so far.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

For the value i really like this camera and i have bought 2 so far.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
We bought this for our 8 year old grandson.  The set up was a bit tough but once he started using it he loved it.  The waterproof case was his favorite.  The only thing that would have been better is if it came with a cable to upload videos and pictures.  We had to get a cable with a converter to save his videos from the micro disk to his iPad.  But that is a minor suggestion.  We give this camera 5 stars.,5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"I used the camera for a couple days outdoors. I used it more for videos than photos, and I'm pretty happy with how they turned out. The videos were taking while in a car driving/off-roading, so considering the activity the video was actually quite stable! It was also very simple and quick to transfer the videos from the camera to my phone with the app. I would recommend using the open back door for videos for better sound quality. I also own a GoPro, and this device comes quite close in features and quality. For the price, it's a great camera!",5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
"What an awesome action camera! I have a GoPro Hero 2 and was looking to upgrade and get an additional action camera when I came across the EK 7000. I couldn’t believe that it was 4K AND WiFi  for such a great price. I was skeptical when I bought it until I tried it out. As a private pilot, it is great having the screen so I can see what I am filming BEFORE I get home. The clarity is unbelievable and the remote control is an absolute safety necessity for my needs. I will be purchasing a 2nd EK7000 to augment the one I currently own. THANKS AKASO for such a great AND affordable product!",5,1,2018-2-11,1,0,0

I have tested the camera in underwater and regular conditions and it has worked perfectly. I was surprised that you can still hear a bit of audio even underwater. The tons of attachments and the second battery are a plus for me. It works well with my phone and the app as well. I look forward to using it on our cruise.

Now IT WON""T DO ANYTHING AT ALL, no screen, no lights, just a dead piece of plastic.  Even with charged batteries.  Piece of garbage.  Save your money and get a Yi.  There are small bubbles under the rear screen (no, it isn't the protective film) with small pieces of dust or something.  The charger light is red until I remove the battery, then it turns blue.  The problem is, it stays blue even after I put the battery back in.",1,1,2017-6-7,1,2,0
"The best of all, the price for this action camera is unbeatable !  A very honest price for what it is and all the accessories that comes with it. Actually, it is a real, real bargain!  Very impressed with the 1080p video quality, something I think is key for an action camera.  Has a high quality look and feel.  Very easy to operate.

"The build quality on the one I received was sub-par. The spring for the up-button is broken and it would jam rendering the camera useless. Unfortunately I really needed the camera for a trip I was leaving for the next day so I decided to tinker with it and I got it to the point where it was usable. However, it is still very frustrating because I had to fix it myself, I have to press very hard to make it work, and it still doesn't click to let me know that the button push has registered. I give two stars because the camera still seems to function correctly and the video/picture quality does not seem bad for personal use.",2,1,2017-6-2,1,1,0
I love the quality and is really small. It is like a go pro without all the extra features. I din't like how it only does 4k in 25 frames per second. I bought with think cheap camera it is more of an action camera still use and love it.I noted it kind of has a fish eye effect but still love.To unlock all options for resolution for video you need an 32 micro sd card.The door at the bottom for the battery was hard to open so I took it and works fine just can't be jostled around or it falls so I lost the two batteries it came with.Great camera hope this helped you know about the product.,5,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"Got the product about a week ago and have been fiddling with it and am very impressed! The quality of the images is very good and the fact that it includes a waterproof case for underwater video and pictures is fantastic. I will be using it heavily during my upcoming snorkeling trip. While it is a good value and comes with a lot of accessories, it surprisingly doesn't come with a wrist strap so I've had to rig one up with the provided accessories. Battery life could also be a little better, but it does come with two batteries and a charger so that definitely helps.",4,1,2018-4-14,1,0,0
Overall product work as expected. Picture quality was great I have it mounted to my motorcycle helmet and it captures great video for when I ride. One of my only cons is the battery life is very short I can probably get about an hour worth of ride before I have to change it out which is expected. With the typical go pro battery I don’t believe you get that much battery life out of it either.Luckily they give you a second battery so I can just switch it out once I reach my destination.,5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"I'm incredibly surprised about the quality of this camera for the price. It works well, is extremely tiny and portable and comes with tons of accessories for mounting and stabilization. This camera is meant for action filming, so if you don't want a fisheye lense then it isn't for you. The screen also is quite small, therefore the quality on the camera itself is a little low. But it works well for my purposes and I'm very satisfied with the end results.",4,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0

I didn't do that and we have some things dated for 01/02/2019 - Oops!",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
I used the camera for 2 days of diving in Roatan. First 2 days everything was fine. On the third day of diving half way through the first dive I went to take another video. Unfortunately the housing was half full of water! I had taken a few video at start of the dive so I know it had a seal when I got in the water. That afternoon. After a dive I took the housing itself into the water off the beach and in about 4 feet of water it flooded again. The camera was very good and took good videos and was easy to use. But the housing failed.,4,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0

The only bad thing I have to say is that some of the mounts are a little confusing just because theres so many options on how to put it but its a great product.,5,1,2017-4-1,1,1,0
So far this product is amazing. We weren’t sure how we felt about a camera and didn’t want to pay 200+ for one. We decided to grab a cheaper version and honestly it’s really nice. There’s two apps you can download. I love being able to see the videos/photos straight on my phone (side note be sure your volume button is on or there will be no sound). I haven’t tried the water proof case yet but it seems pretty solid. The picture is really nice as well. Definitely worth the money!,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
I had thought about buying myself a GoPro for years. I frequently attend large conferences and travel to new places often and was looking for something to document my experiences.

I used it over the 4th of July to capture some awesome videos at a family picnic of my cousins and I will be brining it to Chicago with me in a few weeks while I volunteer at a World Leadership Congress.

This year we are going on another cruise and I decided on the Akaso EK7000 4K after reading many reviews. It takes small learning curve but every time I use it I am impressed. I was very disappointed  about the LOW audio when using the water proof case. Then after reading more reviews I discovered that there is a second rear cover that is vented and it was in the box. Problem solved. The camera is better then I expected given the price. Included are many attachments and bands to attach. I also bought on Amazon a kit with many many more for 24 dollars.,5,1,2017-4-26,1,1,0
"Was going to get a GoPro, but this was an amazing action camera as well. Maybe better! It was cheap as well. There was a lot of qualities packed into such an affordable camera. Also, it came with extra small excesories that I can clip on to things. Has a great image as well. Very clear and has different modes like video, burst, picture, time laps, slo-mo, and some others. Has waterproof case with it too, which I wasn't expecting. It really did fit all my needs.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0

"What a great price for this fantastic camera. I can't believe how good the quality is for the Akaso! Having always bought GoPro's before, I thought I would give this a try because of the low cost. I can't tell any difference between the Akaso and the GoPro's. The mount's are not compatible between the two units, so you will probably want to get the Akaso accessory kit. I bought two of these, and I am very happy with both of them.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
Awesome camera! For the price you really can't beat this camera it is much better than the GoPro does the exact same thing as and is made with high-quality product material but the only thing is you have to find a compatible software that will let you edit the video. Comes with 2 batteries and a charger as well as many other accessories.

I have nothing to reference the quality of the video I took too but I thought it did just fine. The picture was clean and clear. The camera is very simple to use.

Maybe I just had gotten a bad camera, but sometimes you get what you pay for. Oh well. Going to go for the GoPro Hero 4. At least with that one, it has earned a reputation for itself.",1,1,2017-3-21,1,2,0

"I ordered this camera to use a webcam for video conferences.  The video is really dark, so some manual adjustment to the exposure settings is crucial.  Also, the phone app makes the device MUCH easier to use.  If you plan to use it as a webcam, I'd recommend ordering a microHDMI to HDMI cable/converter.  The USB interface as a webcam works, but the throughput on USB makes the video very jerky and not pleasant to watch.",3,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0

It was easy to use underwater and just as easy to view/offload the videos. Could you spend a ton more for a different action camera?  Sure...but why would you?,5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"Video works very well, unfortunately the microphone is very weak. it is very quiet if to want to make videos with audio I have a two year old 5000 model that works better",3,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"1st time I used the camera diving, all was well and it beat my expectations for the price I paid. I did notice a little water had seeped into the case but it didn't cause any issues. The next time however the case leaked and camera quit working. After drying it out it appears its still dead.  Would be an OK camera for dry applications but would not recommend for any water activity.",2,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

"Akaso read a recent complaint I made and did everything in thier power to make it right. Most companies ignore bad reviews or at minimal make an empty apology and move on, but akaso cares about thier customers and asked what they can improve and looked for my feedback to actively make thier product better. Would recommend this product and company to anyone",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

It's an awesome little camera for the price you just cant beat it. Only dislike was the fact that it didnt come with any instructions to how any of the accessories worked or even the names of each one. You have to have an app to scan the code and two of the apps I tried didnt work. Needless to say it took a few weeks but we figured out how to use everything without instructions.,5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I've been impressed with the quality and all that came with the camera for the price.  Good picture quality and great integration with the app...I'm impressed with what I got for the money.

"I took the camera out for the first time yesterday and the latch on the waterproof case broke.  Upon inspection, it looks like the design is very flimsy.  You also need to buy an SD card reader if you want to be able to transfer images off the camera - it estimates that it will take 60-minutes to transfer photos from the camera to my iPhone via wifi and the camera isn't recognized by my computer when I try to connect it via USB.",3,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0

Great little camera at a very affordable price. I use it to capture off-road video in my Jeep. It mounted to my dash and takes great action video.

We got this as a starter camera for our grandson's 8th birthday.  The camera seems to be simple enough that he should be able to start using it immediately with a little guidance. He is becoming quite active in outdoor sports and activities so I'm sure he will start experimenting with the included mounting options soon.  I am confident that he will grow into using  more advanced functions with a little experience.,5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"It is a handy little action camera. It takes decent picture and videos which I think I could compare to more expensive cameras. It is perfect for taking with you on a trip or under the water. It takes a little bit of time to get into the function of the buttons but after a short amount of trying it's easy.There is only one thing I don't like, if I took pictures and wanted to look at the last ones I took. I couldn't find it directly because they are in the reviewer mixed up.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"I ordered this primarily to make drum videos. I wish the recording sound quality was a bit better, but for the price it does the job pretty well. Picture quality is quite good. I've only had it about three days now, but it's done everything I've asked of it. The accesories that came with it are plentiful, although the online manual only has pictographs to help with assembly, so it's a lot like trying to put together IKEA furniture. Looking forward to a lot of use from this in the future!",4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
"I bought this camera for use on our JetSkis but didn't want to pay the high price tag for a GoPro. This camera was a great price and the clarity and color quality of the picture is amazing! Super easy to use and I love the remote. I also have used the app that allows me to use my iPhone to control the camera as well as view the video and pictures as the camera captures them, very handy, especially when the camera is mounted in a position that doesn't lend itself to immediate viewing of the images. I definitely recommend this camera for the outstanding picture, ease of use, and great price!",5,1,2017-1-7,1,2,0
"Seems like a good camera. You get what you pay for definately, although i feel like this camera is better than other 50 dollar cameras on the market.

"Couldn't wait to get this thing out of the box and get it to the track this afternoon.  I love the remote switch it comes with, very simple and convenient accessory.  Pretty smooth video on bumpy roads and for the price, it's an unbeatable product.  Not many action cameras allow a 64mb card or an extra battery.  Why would anyone pay 4 times the amount for a GoPro camera is beyond me.  The accessory bundle it comes with is pretty great as well.  This little camera will definitely be on my list of referrals to friends looking to capture life when they live it at its best.",5,1,2017-1-4,1,2,0
"January, 2017: Just received. Instructions are clear. I've been through all the instructions in the menu everything works except I couldn't get the ""Quick Modes Menu"" to work. I did download the Android APP to my Samsung S6 and was able to operate the camera from the phone. The HD video playback is sharp. Battery life may be shorter than I was hoping, it seemed to drain quickly while I was learning the camera. I'm hoping it will last at least two hours, anything beyond that will be a bonus. I'll return to update this review when I get a chance to try it out.February, 2017: I've used the camera for two weeks as a dashcam, hiking cam, bicycle cam. I'm very impressed with the quality of the video and with the quality of the accessories. The battery is a 1050 mAh Li-ion and lasts only a bit more than ONE hour. That's a disappointment. I'll be checking for a battery with more Amp hours.",4,1,2017-2-3,1,5,0

I had some problems with my goPro and only had it for 2 years and customer service sucks and wouldn't take care of it so I hope I have better luck with this camera and if something goes wrong, I can get help getting it resolved. I sampled some videos and pictures and they look great. I love that it came with 2 batteries but I wish it would've come with an SD card even if it was a smaller GB. I am excited to use!",4,1,2018-5-6,1,0,0
"For the price, you cant beat it. But like the other reviews say. The display on the back SUCKS! The recording quality is great. Look it's not a Gopro, but then again it's not over 300 bucks either. Bang for your buck? Definitely!",4,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0

Worked amazingly well.  Was concerned that for the cost I would possibly sacrifice performance or quality... BUT the was not the case!!This camera is amazing and simple to use.

"First POV type camera I’ve owned, and its been great so far mounted to a bike helmet and handlebars. Advertised as 4K, but seems to produce less choppy video on the 1080 setting.  It would be better if there was a louder beep when you start and stop recording. You also have to wake up the camera to stop the video, so you actually have to hit the button twice to stop recording. Overall it works great and I have some great bike ride videos now.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
Wow this is actually really good quality. Definitely bang for the buck. The wide angle lens is amazing probably my favorite mode. And the battery level is really good too. It’s my first action camera and it’s like perfect. looking forward to go trailing with this.,5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I was having problems with my older gopro and figured a few years had improved technology on the market.  I was pleasantly surprised that the current entry level cameras definitely meet (and in many instances surpass) the specs cameras had just a few years ago.  The 4K on this camera is outstanding.  Same for the 120 FPS.  Transfer to phone via app is quick.  Overall, I'd recommend this camera.  And for the price, it can't be beat.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
I am a go kart racer out of Pennsylvania. I was given a GoPro a couple of years ago. My brother in law recently recommended me to try the EK7000 and wow... the color and sounds absolutely blew me away! I’m loving this camera way more than my go pro!

For the most part the product seems like a quality product. It does take a while to get the process started. Download or get the user manual on your phone via the website/QR code provided. Highly recommend getting an micro SD card with a Class 10 to handle the 4K quality and speed playback. My biggest drawback is the lack of a case/bag to carry the equipment in and a useful Phillips Screwdriver to switch gears.,4,1,2020-3-8,1,0,1

So far it seems to be functioning as designed. I have not cycled through each of the designed features,but the ones I have tried seem to be OK.

I used a 64GB SD card which worked fine, but after about 25 minutes of video capture, it would reset to a new file.  I'm not sure if it's better to use a smaller SD card for continuous recording.

"When I first ordered this product my initial intent was to buy a GoPro. I continued to this products page and started looking at the specs and realized that this product and the GoPro specs matched almost identically. After receiving this product I then tried to attach it to the, already owned, GoPro accessories that I had purchased earlier. I proceeded to download the free app and checked out its features. The only thing that I am not impressed by is that the app is not compatible with 4k or it is not updated enough to recored and take stills in 4k. This was my only gripe with the product and is still not a gripe with the actual product itself.

This camera performed as advertised.  We are planning on taking it on vacation for use in water.  I have tested it out in advance and found it truly is waterproof.  The remote works (but not through glass).  WiFi ap performs.  Be aware that it is a wide angle lens that will distort shapes on the perimeter of the image and is best used to capture images less than four feet from the camera.  Great for remote shots of birds.  Have had a lot of fun testing it on my bird feeders.,4,1,2018-3-3,1,0,0

This cam was easy to use and good quality.  Still learning the ins and outs of recording and editing.

It is not great, and I have only gotten it to connect to the cameras once using my iPhone. It isn't a huge deal breaker for me, and hopefully this is something that will improve in the future.

I haven’t been able to test the 4K out because I don’t have a 4K device to view the videos on, but I’m doing 1080p with the highest FPS and I’ve been satisfied.The videos take quite some time to download to my phone via WiFi, which is my main complaint because you have to keep the app open and keep the screen from locking while it downloads otherwise it will cancel the download.",4,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0

The software is not the greatest, it takes a bit of work to transfer the pictures to your phone wirelessly, but the pictures are decent quality and it’s easy to use.

The downfalls, no directions included, couldn’t see the date so it was wrong on pics, and it did fog up after some use....

Ordered this for my son as he has been asking for a go pro for quite sometime. He is very happy with it so far. Downside to this is there are lots of pieces come in the box and there is no directions as to what they are or how to assemble.

I purchased this camera a few years back and was highly impressed with the value and what this camera provides. This is my first ever action camera so I dont have much to compare to but its easy to use. My previous one was brought to Jamaica and took great videos underwater and out of water. Audio was good even in waterproof case. Only reason I purchased another was due to me losing the previous one. Other than that perfection!,5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
I think the quality was amazing it doesn't look that good on the camera but through the app it looks amazing.  The sound on the camera is horrible but when you hook it up to the app it's not that bad.  The waterproof case and all of the accessories seemed to do the job.

Regarding video quality, I did get two days of underwater footage and I do have a 4K tv.  The video is beautiful both on a computer and on the 4K tv.

Hopefully the second one holds up.",3,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
I can't believe I almost bought a GoPro.  I'm sure they're awesome too... but for like $50 you can have a camera that does the same things at the same level.

"The camera takes pretty good video. However, half or more of the video files were unreadable using a SanDisk 32gb class 10 sdhc card.  Upgrading to a SanDisk 4K uhd sdhc uhs-1 card worked better.  But there are 2 main reasons I gave it 2 stars and why I sent my back: 1) the battery life is horrible - at 70 degrees F., you get an hour or less from a battery, as opposed to the 90 min that is advertised.  At 30 degrees F., you get about 25 min of battery life.  Not good when used mostly for skiing.  2) The date/time keeps getting reset to Oct 1, 2016.  This is very annoying,  Especially because the timestamp is used as a file name.  It's impossible to keep track of your videos and photos when the time stamp keeps changing.",2,1,2017-3-24,1,0,0
Using this camera for action fishing videos. Very easy to use with the remote start/stop that's included in the package. In my opinion the only thing missing in the accessory package is a cap clip. All in all a great bargain for the price.,5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0

This thing is pretty impressive. So far all of the features work. The WiFi works great. Your able to pretty much do everything from your phone except change the system settings on the camera. You can change the different video modes and picture modes on your phone. Many accessories included. I had a gopro once but I got a bad egg I think. This is a cheaper alternative that delivers results. Video uploaded is at 1080p/60fps. Of course the quality is lowered after uploaded online.,5,1,2017-3-7,1,0,0

Disappointing. I am not looking forward to going through the whole warranty process. I would not recommend buying this.",1,1,2019-2-28,1,0,1
"I'm satisfied with the quality of the video and the resolution of the photo is a bit disappointing. When I tested the watertight case, I didn't know the water.

I just received the camera today and the product came on time. Packaging seemed amigos and nothing was broken or missing. There are a ton of attachments. The manual does not explain how to use all the attachment and I’m not sure what to do with some of them. The camera has a lot of good reviews and I will soon find out how the camera performs. Stay tuned...,4,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

This thing is really cool and the image is just spot on and i have never seen one of these in person but its smaller the i anticipated and the accessories it comes with seen pretty solid compared to store bought ones i know because i have but some just incase i didnt like the ones it came with ended up taking the ones i bought back lol good little action camera,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,1

"Great entry level action camera that suited our family holiday needs ~ theme parks and snorkelling! We couldn't justify the cost of Go Pros, and after reading the amazon reviews, I bought this.  It arrived just in time for our trip to Dubai, and the resultant videos and shots from Aquaventure and theme parks are brilliant! Great quality even at 720fps and super easy to use.

Sound Quality went out. This is a cheap alternative to a GO Pro but will never by again. Do a lot of trail riding and a friend of mine has a GO Pro and there is no comparison.

This is a great little camera! Your can't beat the price for all the features it offers. Excellent picture quality. Comes with a bunch of accessories for various mounting options. Battery life is good before it needs recharging. 2 batteries came with my camera. I got a lot of time on each charge/battery. I used it to record long drives.

This camera performs amazing considering its price. The wifi remote viewing is a nice touch and works flawlessly in my opinion. You also get a plethora of accessories. The stuff you get as well as features exceed the price point. Would be nice if it came with a starter memory card  so it can be used out of the box. Still gets 5 stars as that is really my only complaint and it is not detrimental to the product.,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,1

I opened it up and checked and the battery was already charged.  Cool.  I already had a 32GB microSDHC card for it and it slid right in. I had this camera up and running, taking videos and pictures in less than 15 minutes.  I haven't had time to check out a lot of the features, but the operation is simple and the videos/pictures are high quality.  The wrist remote is really useful, and the iPhone app works as described.  This seems like the perfect sports camera for the person who thinks he/she might want a GoPro.  Once you get this one, I bet you never ""upgrade"" to the GoPro because you'll never notice the difference between the two.  Yep, this Akaso Ek7000 is that good.",5,1,2017-1-8,1,6,0

They give you two batteries, but they have to be charged individually and they take 3.5 hours to charge. The gopro I had could charge both at the same time. But that's okay.

The mounts and accessories are ok, but definitely a little flimsier than those provided by GoPro. But they all work well and you cant beat the price. I sumed up what all that equipment would cost if I bought it from GoPro and came up with about $800.Can't say enough - highly recomended.",5,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
"So right out of the box the screen picture is a little fuzzy and distorted. I’ll update later after I check out a video from walking my dog. The accessories are super nice and convenient but you def need to buy more to hook to the accessories you get in the box. Only complaint is the clip on does not swivel. Overall, seems great so far. Again, will update later after it gets more use in my hiking adventures.",4,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
I just got this camera the other day and was very surprised at the quality of the video and images. Videoed over two hours using the two supplied batteries which is an extra plus that you get two batteries. Very easy to operate. The app is a little wonky in that sometimes it has trouble connecting to my phone but works well when connected. Over all a very good camera package for the price.,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
For the price its no brainer. I tried it today going to work and i just love the quality of the camera. I'm not a tech person but i know this is a solid and more affordable sports action camera out there. I like the fact that it has a remote control and i can connect it to my phone. I can control the camera and download photos and videos through my phone. Great camera!UPDATE: 3/31/17,5,1,2016-12-30,1,1,0
"So far, so good. The camera was a great price. I feel comfortable experimenting with this before diving into a more expensive model. I would love of there were an option that came with different accessories. I haven't been able to really use it yet because I am still waiting on the 64gb micro SD card as well as the additional accessories. Plan on spending an additional $30ish to really be able to put it to the test. But hey, I didn't pay that much for the camera.",4,1,2018-4-11,1,0,0

Great quality for the money. I have had no problems recording in 1080p at 60 frames per second. The waterproof case works great. I have used the bike mount and it works great. The batteries are easy to change. The microphone picks up good sound while it is out of the case. There are so many included mounts that I can mount it almost anywhere!

"This camera is awesome for the price and everything that was in the description came with the package. I've played with it for about half a day already it it does everything you need it to. The battery holds a charge for more than enough time while running in 30 FPS at 1080p and the video comes out crystal clear and since it comes with a second battery, you'll have plenty of recording time. It also very convenient that you can use gopro attachments for it as well so you have a bunch of different mounting accessories to choose from. If you want an action camera that can do everything while costing less than half the price, this is your camera.",5,1,2018-1-6,1,0,0
Bought the product for a family cruise. Used it on a zipline in Honduras and while snorkeling. Zipline worked out great. Would have liked that the wrist remote for the camera was waterproof. Was tough to make sure it was recording while in the waterproof case and mounted on the snorkel. Didn't do full 4k quality to conserve storage space and was pleased with image quality. Would recommend.,4,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0

It’s a great camera for the price. qualities good mic works but you’ll wanna get a better one if you care about audio.

I can't speak much to the underwater components as I haven't tried that part out yet.

There’s practically nothing to dislike about this camera. It works amazing and just the same as the expensive competitors.

If your looking for a camera for your biking trails and weekend trips to the lake this is a great little action camera. Dont expect amazing quality regarding photos because this isn't ment for that I would look at this strictly for the Video.,5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
my mother purchased 2 of these action cams for my daughters. these cameras are awesome they take great video. camera gets a little hot when using 4k and batery drains rather quickly however when recording in 2.7 picture is excellent and battery is a little longer. came with 2 batteries and lots of accessories. i have the go pro version of these action cams and there is very little difference for the costs.,5,1,2018-1-26,1,0,0
The camera has definitely met our expectations. It's a great little unit that's easy enough to use. One of the great upsides is that it comes with so many mounting options that it saves a good deal of money just on the accessories that you would have to buy to get the action shots you're looking for. Well thought-out product. Very happy with it.,5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"Pretty pleased with the camera so far, but I'm still getting used to it. It could come with a better user manual, but scanning the QR code gives you a helpful pdf.  As the listing states, you need to order a separate SD card.  It came with more accessories than I saw in the listing, but not the most important ones to me (head mount, chest mount, floating handle), so I'll have to buy an accessory set. Much better value than gopro.",5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0

The remote was useless, as it didn't work very well and again, it still wasn't easy to tell if it was really recording.",2,1,2017-12-10,1,1,0

"I purchased this camera for an upcoming trip this summer, and so far, I am extremely impressed. After debating between this camera and versions by SJCAM and Lightdow, I originally ordered the Lightdow. The pictures taken by the Lightdow were very blurry, lines kept appearing across the display screen, and the battery window was cheaply made and almost broke on the first use. Needless to say, I quickly returned that model and purchased the AKASO EK7000. This product is of much higher quality, and the pictures are extremely clear. Plus, this product comes with a remote. So far, I am extremely pleased with my purchase!",5,1,2017-1-29,1,1,0
AKASO EK7000 4K represent a significant alternative to the exceedingly higher-priced GoPro. The video quality is excellent. It came with lots of clip accessories. Two batteries and a charger. I takes about 2 hours to charge batteries if totally dead. Charges two at once. The waterproof case worked excellently! No leaks as my kid tried in the bath tub for more than 45 minutes,5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
We ordered this for my 7yo sons birthday.  This was only a little more than a kids camera and we figured this was good for adults in case my son didn’t really use it.

I bought this for my husband so he can record his roller hockey games. For the price it is an amazing product. Daytime use it amazing as well.

Which might not be an issue for other uses.,4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
This is now my third review of this product. I was initially very satisfied with the camera as an affordable alternative to GoPro. The side buttons then broke off on me after little use.

So I'm changing the review back to 5 stars based on their customer service.,5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,1
A great buy! Far less expensive compared to the competitors and this EK7000 does everything I need it to do. It's easy to use and I had it up and running in no time.

"So after doing alot of research for a cheap action camera, I decided on purchasing the AKASO7000.  I was very hesitant to invest in a fully priced gopro because I wasn't sure if I would use it or not.  But in the few days I have had it, I don't regret my purchase.  My family and I are going on a cruise in April and I plan on getting alot of great shots for it.  The AKASO is very intuitive and a great purchase for some one interested in action cameras but hesitant about paying big money for a gopro.  AKASO7000 is a great purchase",5,1,2017-1-10,1,1,0

This camera is great for its price. It's so close to the 500$ gopro I can't believe it!The one thing to note is that the still images are not good. So don't even try to take pictures.,5,1,2018-1-5,1,0,0
I'm giving this item three stars because of the quality of the images and video recording. Images do not look 4K or anything close to high quality resolutions. Videos and images are grainy even with editing. Played around with the settings but did not make the quality any better. I guess for the price the low resolution is expected.,3,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0

We bought this camera then the pro version 2 months later for my other son. The pro version is much better. This version has a delay when hitting record before it starts recording.

"I'll start by saying that this has got to be one of the best reviewed items on Amazon based on thousands of reviews and a mid 4 star rating. If you remove the poor reviews from the people too stupid to peel the film off the lens or the waterproof casing to see it isn't scratched, or the morons who dive into the ocean thinking it's waterproof without the casing, I guarantee you this review would be near a perfect 5 stars. That said, this is a fantastic little camera. I wish people would keep in mind that it's under $100 bucks and comes with so many extras, it's easily worth twice that. Is it as good as a GoPro? No but a GoPro 4 is going to run you twice to three times this price while a GoPro 5 is bordering on $500 for 4k recording. The fact is this camera is a really good camera. Not just for $85 bucks, but just really good. I'm able to use it on my motorcycle, around the house to harass my dogs who somehow know I am recording them,or at night time to piss my wife off when she is talking to me in the bedroom about nonsense things and then learns I recorded her whole spiel. The picture quality is fantastic. The audio is pretty good too if you are within a 2 foot radius of the camera. Outside of that, you probably need an external mic which this does not allow for unfortunately. The instruction booklet is sparse but it helps. This isn't exactly made in an English speaking country so cut them some slack. It doesn't feel like it's made of much, but the little guy is pretty sturdy. This is easily one of the best deals anywhere for anything.EDIT: 8/13/17 update- I've now had this camera for nearly 5 months and it has been really great. I have purchased several add-ons for the camera, namely a good mount for my motorcycle. I've recorded hours upon hours of rides, dozens of gigabytes worth of time on my motorcycle, and this little camera keeps on ticking. The video is really good, the photos are decent (though my Samsung phone does better) and the build quality of this little knock-off is extraordinary. Buy yourself some of the extended life batteries that will give you 1.5 hours of recording time in 1080p/60fps and take them with you. Eventually, I will move on to a Gopro for the video stabilization and noise reduction, but for now, there is no better camera for the money than this one.",5,1,2017-5-27,1,2,0

"I bought this to get action POV shots for when I go snowboarding. Originally, I combined some of the accessories that came with the camera (there are a lot, and it made my head spin) to make myself a headstrap, but it was too front-heavy and unstable, so I ended up buying a goPro head strap instead to go with it. It also does not come with the selfie stick, which would be the only other accessory I would use very regularly. The rest of the accessories are specific - for strapping to handlebarsIt can take a little while to get used to, at first.

"What an awesome camera for 2x less then the real thing. Yes please do use the real go pro accessory as you cant beat the quality of a go pro accessory. The camera quality is rather very nice compared to go pro, very easy to use. I have had a ton of fun filming with a camera for $80 rather then $450. Of course its great for beginners, but for someone filming everyday i would recommend buying a go pro because the app that this camera uses needs a lot of work, sometimes it doesn't connect and or shuts down at random times, especially when you have the camera on your roof of the car and your driving down the highway and you loose connection with the phone to camera, then you dont know if its still there or not.. and no you cant use it with the go pro app. The batteries die rather fast..

"Great action camera for the money. I'm not a professional photographer, but for my ""weekend warrior"" use, the quality is great.  In some instances, this appears (to my eyes) to be better than the ""other"" more expensive action cameras.  The wrist remote is a great bonus, especially with the head or helmet mount.  The one con is that currently the Ez iCam app they have you download does not work with this camera. It keeps displaying a message on how this camera is not supported in preview mode and will not connect.  You can download another app that does work. It is called ""PNJ iCAM"" and it works just fine.  It says it does not support a 64gb card, but that is what I'm using.  I don't know if it will only utilize up to 32gb of the 64gb.  Time will tell.  The accessories are plentiful, but not the same quality as the GoPro, but this would be expected with the price.  Even if there were no accessories it would be a great value.  5 stars if they fix the app problem. Over all, I would recommend.",4,1,2017-1-28,1,6,0

"Amazingly fast delivery.  Ordered at 9 p.m. and was in my hands by 5 p.m. the next day with Amazon Prime free delivery.  Unfortunately it is a really crappy camera.  I tried 1080p at 30 fps, 60 fps and 4K at 24 fps.  In all three cases, the slightest motion created a blurred image. There seems to be some type of software interpolation to create these image sizes and they are not really at the resolution they claim to be.  In other words, it is not done optically.  Seems deceptive to me and the camera is useless for drone videography.  I'm going to try to use it with 12mp time lapse photography. They probably have a 2mp image that their processor is interpolating and blowing up into a 12mp image - sort of a built-in digital zoom.  So, if I don't get a crisp image it's going back.

"Although the camera claims a resolution of 4K the quality of the pictures is awful (I made the comparison for several situations on a Mac with a 5k screen), compared with another, more expensive, action cam with 4K (Yi). Something in this cam , apparently not the number of pixels, causes the bad image quality. The lack of image stabilisation even adds to the low rating, as does the fact that the internal time stops as soon as the camera is switched off. Akaso also does not seem to have a helpdesk. For me, the low price and many accessories does not justify this lack of quality.",2,1,2017-1-1,1,1,0

"Some problems with this cheapen the entire device. Getting straight to the points, the waterproof case is crap, the buttons on it don't work. On examining the buttons, I can see on two of them that don't work the plungers are just a touch shorter than the others, maybe a millimieter or less, but enough that the plungers can't properly press the buttons on the camera itself. To prove this, I slid a small piece of folded paper inbetween the camera and the corresponding buttons that didn't work to account for the short plunger and viola, the buttons would now work while inside the case. So that might be a work around but I think it's an unacceptable solution. Next is the ""EZ iCam"" android app - TOTAL crap, doesn't work. Phone says its connected, cam changes from waiting for wifi to wifi ready but no difference on the app - there is no control at all. Usually it would connect without asking for a wifi password but a couple times I could get it to prompt (but can't remember how I made that happen) but still no difference. The camera is usable outside of these problems. I don't have a 'real' gopro to compare it to, but my son who has one (but is only 12) is not impressed with it. However, the low price is the only thing keeping it in the competition, because you can buy 2, 3 or 4 of these over a single gopro. Overall, if you can live without the wifi and are willing to dink with the case if your buttons suck then I'd say its a good choice to start with instead of a several hundred dollar gopro, especially if you are planning to use it for any gnarley stuff that risks damaging your cam. The wrist remote is probably an okay substitute for app based control, but there's no feedback for you to know if you are really controlling it without looking at the camera itself. If you get it, I'd recommend getting the 3 battery plus charger you can find on Amazon for only about $17, which would arm you with 5 batteries total. Hope this review helps!",3,1,2017-3-4,1,3,0
"Love the Akaso  E700. I'm a 10 year old boy and my parents gave it to me for my birthday. It is easy to put together and take apart (YouTube can help). The pictures are great and it's easy to use.

My wife and I were debating on whether to buy a GoPro or the Akaso EK7000. After researching and reading reviews on both we decided to purchase the Akaso. Our first experience with it was in Florida on vacation. We were absolutely AMAZED on how clear the videos and still pictures were!!

I really like the camera for my motorcycle. I do have a windshield so its easier to capture images when the wind is not at play.The reason I make it a 4 star is the little metal pieces at the end of the screw bars come out from time to time when screwing in the bar. Make sure you hold them in place. Other than that it's really good.,4,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0

"I think the hype about the camera is that it's inexpensive, and that it does basically all a GoPro does for nearly 300$ less (with the exception that it is NOT touch screen). I found the photos were really REALLY grainy, and when taking photos of people it distorted their facial features. There is an app you can connect to, but it's kind of a pain because it times out pretty quickly and once it times out you can't do anything with the camera itself so you basically have to shut the camera off and turn it back on.

It's probably too late to send it back and I have had it out of the box and attached to various mounts so it's probably not fair to send it back but it's a real annoyance. I guess you get what you pay for.",1,1,2017-2-23,1,4,0

"So I received this Akaso Ek7000 after scouring the Amazon, internet & youtube for endless days. All because I wanted to get the best bang for my buck. And this little cam is top notch without question. I've used it swimming at the Ymca, strapping to my boys life jackets & going down the big twirling slide, the video is amazing. I use it at 1080p at 60fps. The waterproof case works flawlessly. It can go to 2k & 4k HD resolution for the video, and the camera pictures at 12mp is excellent quality as well. I've so far taken this Akaso everywhere. Even out in below zero temperature with my dog, running around, even tossed it into a fluffy snow bank with the case on just so I could watch it afterwards on my computer. The watch button style remote control does wonders for when you have the camera away from you. The buttons for camera & video start/stop are on time & gives ya a mission impossible feel with it on, cause no one knows what it's for or what your doing when pressing the buttons, haha. I can honestly tell other customers to buy this without hesitation, because I've done extensive research & played with this nice Akaso Ek7000 for several weeks & it's performing fantastic. Meeting & exceeding my expectations. You won't find another action cam under $100, with countless attachments mix & match plus an extra battery! Hope this helps you with deciding to purchase it, cause you won't be disappointed. :)",5,1,2017-1-15,1,2,0

The quality of the videos is awesome.Just a side note, ""timelapse"" is not actually timelapse. It's just a timed photograph. I believe there is a function for actual timelapse, but I'm not too sure how to do it yet.",5,1,2017-8-26,1,0,0
"I really don't know if this action cam can be compared with GoPro or other more expensive action cam as I haven't tried those.I was looking an affordable action cam that can record 1080p 60 fps. After searching for a while and reading reviews on variety of action cams, I've stumbled upon Akaso EK700 and decided that for my needs this action cam will suffice. I was not disappointed and the cam is great. The video quality is amazing( I've only tried 1080/720p). The accessories bundle is amazing, especially at that price.",5,1,2017-1-27,1,6,0

"This Action Camera is a very well designed one. If your looking for a cheep action camera that shoots as well/ if not better than a go pro than this one is it. It comes with many accesories for any mount that you can imagine. Although, it does not come with a head/ chest mount. It is very easy to move around the screen and get were you want to go. It also shows how long/ how many pictures you can take. The camera shoots very smoothly and very good quality.

I have had this for a week now and used it at my airsoft games with some friends and it works wonderfully on 1080p at 60fps.The wifi remote definitely comes in handy when its mounted on your hat! I was searching for an action camera that was inexpensive but still of decent quality. I searched all other results and kept coming back to the EK7000. Im glad I chose this cam. It comes with an insane amount of accessories as well. This action cam is definitely the best value for what you pay. Five stars.NOTE please get a UHS-3 Micro SD card to record in 4K. I purchased a sandisk class 10 UHS-1 card and it cannot keep up with 4K recording. It works fine on 1080p 60fps though.,5,1,2017-1-3,1,1,0

Action cameras are always at risk so you want something durable. Second, the footage is is very disappointing. At 60 frames you get a lot of blur, low light detail loss is an issue even when there is light and colors are washed out. I really wanted this camera to work so it would embarrass companies like GoPro that inflate their prices just because the name but it didn't do it for me.",1,1,2017-1-24,1,3,0
I was skeptical at first due to price of the product. Once I received the product I was extremely surprised and pleased with the product and all it’s accessories.

"Was in the market for a go-pro type camera, but couldn't see spending the money for a go-pro. This got the job done for the right price. Easy to use and good image quality.

I have 3 trailers so I find my myself hooking up to a trailer a lot. I back into a trailer so much that I am pretty good at doing it by myself but rarely do it get it in the first try. I started looking at truck backup cameras and all of the wireless ones had just average ratings and were $150 or more. One of the bad reviews mentioned that they used an action camera and it worked great. I found this one for half the price and it fits my needs plus I might actually use it as an action camera. Obviously it wouldnt be ideal to use as your everyday backup camera but for hooking up to a trailer it works great.,5,1,2017-3-15,1,0,0

The quality of the pictures were really good. The quality in video was good. When you created a video and it was inside the casing you could not hear the people talking. The battery would only last about 50 minutes fully charged. Good thing it came with two batteries. A lot of accessories included which was a huge plus. If you think about it the camera is only $59 while the accessories added $20 to the total value,4,1,2017-8-25,1,0,0
"I haven't gotten the chance to take this camera out on the slopes yet but from the pictures and video I have recorded, it seems to be exactly what I was looking for. For those of you looking for great pictures and video at a reasonable price, this is the action camera to buy! The package deal with the AKASO EK7000 makes it that much better! It comes with multiple attachments and the REMOTE which is perfect when the camera is attached to your helmet and its difficult to reach. It is also compatible with a 64 GB memory card, allowing for extra storage space. The second battery that comes with the package is a great add too!",4,1,2017-1-22,1,0,0

"Purchased in 2018, I wanted an action camera, but didn't want to commit to a big price since we only use it on family vacations.  I've had no issues, it's performed in all kinds of environments.

Amazing quality at a great price. Many people feel you need to buy a GoPro just to get good quality action camera footage but with this camera you get amazing footage at a fraction of the cost. The kit comes with all kinds of hookups you will need along with a wristband to start and stop videos and photos. I have used this camera constantly and I've gotten some amazing photos and videos with it I suggest this camera to any beginner that wants to get into action video and photography,5,1,2018-1-22,1,0,0

"I use this camera in my property inspection business.  I wear it on my forehead, so it records whatever I see and say.  I have inspected four homes with it so far, and it does the job.  The wide angle lens distorts the image, but that is not important to my application.  Using the buttons to access the menu is becoming more familiar.  One gripe:  after my second use, the clip detached from its cheapie wire hinge somehow and was lost.  When I contacted Akaso about getting a new part they just told me that Amazon sold waterproof housings.  I see replacement housing latches are much better constructed.  I got through the day with the old housing wrapped in rubber band, but I would have preferred a camera with a better housing than that fancy box with that display case lid.  Really...just look at it!  Akaso, a plain brown box would suffice.  If I could I would knock you down half a star over the poor housing design, but I do like the little camera at this point, and battery life is okay.  And there is a review which says that the camera only records vids fifteen minutes long.  Mine will record one long vid that fills the drive if I so desire.  I'll revisit this in six months or so.",5,1,2017-2-19,1,2,0
"This is a cheap and easy to use camera. But it isn't 4K, it isn't wifi. The resulting video clearly looks like something that has been upscaled. Its not quality you'd upload or show around. Works fine as a dash cam.",3,1,2017-11-2,1,0,0

"I purchased this AKASO EK7000 4K because I wanted to have a sports action camera that is suitable to my budget and to replace my old one. For the price that's less than $100 bucks and with all the accessories included with these package, I've got everything that I need to keep going anytime I want to go on a road bike. And also it's a perfect fit with my Feiyu Tech G4 3 axis gimbal. I haven't tried setting it at 4K video set up because as of now I don't have a 4K video input, but I'm amazed and very happy with the 1080 HD quality. I love this sports action camera.",5,1,2016-12-26,1,0,0

Received the product 1 day in advance of scheduled delivery date which was nice. Product packaging was in great shape. Opened camera and read the directions and started using the camera. Watched a video on Youtube to help with the workings of the camera which was a great help. I have now used the camera for video and still pics and this little camera works great!

Absolutely found this camera to be great during vacation trips to the lake or camping when I don't want to take my bigger camera out.

My brother has a GoPro and was impressed with this camera. We took video and pictures on both to compare and we all thought the Akaso was just as good if not better than the GoPro!

Arrives as described. Contains a variety of plastic mounting brackets/clips/clamps/options that give many different options for mounting. Camera is 2.25in wide x 1. 5in high x 1in thick. Comes with a clear plastic waterproof case custom fit with an extra replacement back. Comes with a USB cable and AC adapter for charging (does charge when connected to a computer). Does not come with an SD card which you will need to take video or photos.  I cannot speak to quality of image as I am not an experienced videographer but it seems great to a novice. The best thing about the camera is that it will stream the video to your Android cell phone using the free app you download (it has its own WiFi so does not require an Internet connection to stream to your phone). This is a great feature for everything from a temporary baby monitor to backup camera for hitching your trailer (used a flame of a candle on my bumper while the camera was in my truck cab and it streamed with no delay or latency to my G3 Android). If this thing does break/fail after a few months I will change the rating to LOVE.,5,1,2016-12-13,1,2,0

"Nifty little device. This was my first action cam so I don't have a good basis for comparison- however I've been quite impressed with this product, and at a fraction of the cost of a Gopro.Comes with the camera, waterproof case, remote and straps and other accessories. The included instructions were not too helpful but it seems pretty easy to figure out. Downloaded the EZ icam app for the iPhone and connected to the camera quite easily. The app allows for realtime feed, control of camera and also allows for editing of video though I haven't used that function yet.",4,1,2017-1-13,1,1,0

"I've been looking around for a go-pro for our upcoming South Caribbean cruise but they're all so dang expensive!  Then I took a chance on what I suppose you could call a ""Go-Pro knockoff"".  It's not fair to call this product a knock off though because it's every bit as capable as the go-pro from what I can tell.  I took some sample videos underwater, in low light and daylight.  I'm very happy with the quality of the video and the high FPS option in 720P is awesome!  The 170 degree fisheye lens lets you capture all the action around you without missing anything important.It comes with a TON of accessory mounts for just about anything you can think of.  The buttons all actuate cleanly and accurately, although it's a bit cumbersome navigating through the menus with a lack of touchscreen.  The included remote works well- I'm not sure I'll use it on the cruise a lot but I can see using it while my hands are full on a bike ride for example.",5,1,2017-1-14,1,2,0

"I bought this camera for use in and around water. I haven't had the chance to test out the ""waterproof"" capability yet. I have used it to take some pictures and videos both in low inside lighting and brighter out side lighting. As for the resolution, I found that you need it to be bright for decent video quality. low lighting causes poor quality video and wouldn't recommend for indoor use. As for out side you get better quality video. 4K size videos but with SD to 720P quality video I would say. For the price of the camera I'm not sure if you would be able to beat this. The instructions that come with the camera don't go into enough detail I don't think. It took me a while to figure out how to change some settings no thanks to the manual. In the manual I says the camera is compatible with 8, 16, and 32GB micro SD cards, I bought and used a 64GB card because Amazon said it was Frequently bought together. I also used a older 8GB card I had laying around and saw no deference in video quality. Playback videos on the camera have very low sound that you can hardly hear. Although once you upload the video file on the computer you can hear it much better. I can't seem to get videos longer then about 10 minutes before it makes a new track. I'm not sure if this can be changed or not. The Camera app ""Ez iCam"" wouldn't work for me I kept getting a message saying the product is not a registered device and to return to the seller. I read that I should download and use ""iSmart DV"" It took a few tries to get the camera to connect. I played around with it for a few then when I tried it again the next day I wasn't able to connect to the camera and gave up after about 10 tries.",5,1,2017-3-26,1,1,0

"I just returned my second EK7000 camera.  The first camera worked great and I liked it, but one of the batteries was non functioning and the Akaso tech support refused to send me a new battery.  The second camera also has some battery issues and the camera does not work most of the time.  It will start recording, then freeze and the only way to unfreeze it is by removing the battery.  When it does successfully record without freezing, it will only properly save some of the video on to the SD card and save a couple of corrupted files that I still can not remove from the SD card using my computer.  This is using a top of the line SanDisk microSD card that worked perfectly in the first camera.  I really want one of these cameras to work for me so I will purchase one more in hopes that it actually works and comes with good batteries.Also, the sound recording is pretty terrible with both cameras I have tried, especially when in the waterproof case, but for an action cam that's ok, some don't record sound at all.",2,1,2017-3-22,1,2,0

"I almost bought a GoPro over Christmas, but I wasn't sure if what I wanted is an action camera and for the price it would of been a waste if I didn't use it. When I saw the Akaso I decided it was a perfect time to give an action camera a try and after reading reviews and watching various videos it didn't take me long to make the decision to purchase it.As a newbie to action cams and who doesn't like to read manuals, I was a little overwhelmed with all the mounts and parts that came with the camera so my hate of manuals was defeated and I ended up having to take a peek to see what goes with what. I found out that most of them I would probably not use (like the helmet cam mounts) so I have to order the kit that has more useful accessories for my purposes. I plan on using mine for vacations where there are no helmets required but a lot of walking, some climbing, boating, and snorkeling. I can't wait to test it under water which I will do on my upcoming vacation and come back to update my review. I had no problem with the battery compartment as some reviewers had. I just used my nail and it popped right off.  I found the settings extremely easy to use, no manual required initially, but I did learn quite a bit just reading reviews which I found more helpful than the manual. The only issue I have had so far is that the the button to record doesn't always respond the first push when I want to stop recording. I have had to push it twice a few times. Maybe its not enough pressure, but I have no problems starting the recording, so I don't think so. So far so good on my first few videos, I really think for the price you can't beat this camera.",5,1,2017-1-27,1,1,0

"I bought this camera to use as a dash cam, but I like the versatility that I can attach this to my bike or helmet primarily to take action shots.  I have it on 1080p (60fps), the mic is pretty weak, but the video is crisp and clear, and I can see the potential of simply adding music to the videos using an editor.  As a dash cam, I noticed the battery tended to heat up, so I took it out of its water proof case, and used one of its attachments to hold just the camera to my car mount, this seems to resolve some of the over-heating. Not all of the attachments included with the camera have instructions, you just have to figure it out yourself, for example I’ve figured out how to connect it to my selfie stick, and tri pod using the included attachments.  For the price and for what you get, this is a great value.  Additional accessories I’ve bought are extra batteries with charger so I don’t have to plug the actual camera to charge the battery, car mount and micro SD card.  I also downloaded the app Ez iCam, which lets you control the camera wirelessly through Wi-Fi, and this doesn’t appear to use my smart phone’s data plan, as one reviewer pointed out its pretty much an alternate to bluetooth.  But opening the files of the SD card from my PC, the videos weren’t broken up in 10 minute intervals as another review mentioned, just the length of the recording session.  Bottom line:  This camera is a great value, I enjoy its ease of use and versatility, and it will definitely come in handy.",4,1,2017-2-1,1,1,0

I was surprised with all of the accessories that were included. Everything fits with universal accessories. The camera is easy to operate. I however would prefer that when the camera is turned on that it is set to camera verses the video. It took some getting use to. I used this camera on a Caribbean vacation. It takes excellent land photos. Very clear and with great color. The wide lens  makes for beautiful landscape photos. This camera does not take good pic in dusk/dark. No flash. The underwater photos turned out well. I had many people ask me about my camera and even offered to buy it off of me. I would suggest this camera to anyone.

"I was looking for a good and inexpensive alternative to the GoPro action camera's. I did some research and tried to compare the many brands/versions on the market. Based on the many reviews for the AKASO EK7000 4k camera and the price point of under $100, I wanted to see if I found a GoPro alternative. I have only had the camera for about a month now and I am quite pleased. Now...GoPro has some features that are better in terms of the quality of the sound/audio, but for this price point the quality is pretty darn goodl! The waterproof casing is sturdy and fits snug. I have not truly tested it in a pool or ocean yet, but I hope to do that in the upcoming months. I like that AKASO comes with an extra battery and the wrist remote. Syncing the camera to my smartphone was pretty easy using wifi. The camera is lightweight and has a 2 inch LCD display screen on the back. There are many pluses on this little action camera. This was definitely a good and inexpensive alternative to the GoPro's!",5,1,2018-3-12,1,4,0

"To start off I must say I am no professional camera man. I did a lot of research into this product and many of its competitors prior to purchasing. It was interesting that the capabilities were expected to be comparable to that of an overpriced GoPro, and to make it even more attractive it was a fraction of the price. I have played around with a couple different models of the GoPro and I must say that I am thoroughly happy that I bought an action camera for much cheaper but with the same, if not better, quality than those that are outrageously priced. The functionality of the camera is fairly basic and requires little to no previous experience with action cameras. The menu is user friendly and easy to navigate.The package comes with a dozen or so attachments. Still trying to figure out what some of them are for, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I will say that during a test shot, i took the camera (inside the waterproof case) out for a drive. Although i did not notice any evidence while playing back later, i did notice that condensation had gotten into lens of the waterproof casing. Not that the camera was at risk, because there is an air gap of sorts within the structure of the case at the lens part. Not sure whats up with that, but it very well could have been the fact that I live in the deep south and the humidity can be pretty unforgiving around here.",5,1,2017-2-18,1,1,0

"The action camera was best deal for the best reviewed GoPro knockoff. I bought it knowing it. Couldn't afford the real thing. I know I feel guilty not supporting the original GoPro R&D, continuing developments, support and marketing.Also EK7000 has good build quality, good video quality without a side by side comparison, packaged well with fast delivery.

Bought this on an impulse when I came across it from reccomendation via Amazon. The previous customer reviews sealed the deal and I would certainly agree with other happy customers. I have used this camera more than any other because of the convenience and small size and I have been coming up with new ideas for its use. Better than expected video and picture quality. The free app (android) works well as an interface to control the camera remotely and to view/delete stored items which is better than trying to navigate through the menu just using the buttons on the camera. The only drawback to this camera is that it needs a good amount of ambient light for best results (i.e. underwater shots when fishing don't turn out so well however images came out good at a water park in clear swimming water). My kids love this camera as well when I strapped it to them on a water slide; they keep asking to use it for all kinds of stuff. I purchased extra batteries and fast micro SD cards with my original order because of doubt of performance with other cameras but I quickly found out that the batteries last a good amount of time for my use (actual time unknown but I have been using the same battery for 3 days and still have half life left). I would reccomend not skimping on the sd cards as slower and lower grade cards can hinder speed and performance. I can't speak for the higher priced comparison but this camera has certainly won me over for a fraction of the price.,5,1,2017-7-18,1,1,0

"The AKASO EK7000 met my expectations! I was expecting to receive a great product, and I did! Great quality! I have used the camera several times to lower it to the bottom of a reef area from the boat where we have been fishing. Great to see what is down there. Deepest so far is around 60 feet.

"Great action camera. The camera housing doesn't feel as durable and rugged as I'd like but it only feels that way. I don't plan on abusing it in order to test its durability.

Pleasantly surprised by the video quality and ease of use. Remote control works as it should. I was a bit concerned about purchasing a 64GB SD card as I was getting mixed signals as to what size actually works in these cameras but the 64GB works flawlessly. Battery life seems a bit short but so far I've only recorded in pretty low ambient temperatures so the extra battery comes in handy. Accessories seem to be of good quality. Bottom line is you'd be hard pressed to find a better camera for the price.,4,1,2017-2-13,1,0,0

"The Pros: The camera is exactly as described.  It comes with everything in the pictures and the camera and accessories are actually decent quality as well.  From past experience, when you buy an off brand GoPro product its normally pretty cheap.  But this stuff was actually pretty good.  The quality of the video is very good.  I own a Hero+lcd and the video is very comparable in quality.  I would definitely buy another one of these cameras.The Cons:  I didn't see anywhere that in order to shoot the higher quality modes you needed a class 10(high speed) micro SD card.  I assumed my micro SD cards i was using with my GoPro would work. (which could be my mistake).  The only other thing i dont care for is if the camera is on and I try to load it into the waterproof housing and snap the cover shut, it will start recording.",5,1,2017-3-8,1,2,0

"I was slightly skeptical of all of the five star reviews but I decided to give it a chance. Ultimately, it really didn't meet my personal standards. First of all, one of the accessories shown in the description was missing. Second, the water proof case wasn't the best build quality and it had quite a few marks on it from the factory. The two major factors for my two star review though were due to the battery cover and the video quality. In general, a lot of the video quality wasn't even as good as what my iPhone can produce and it seemed to issues being played in both Quicktime and VLC. Now, the battery door is a huge issue for me. It's not hinged to the camera itself which makes it way too easy to lose due to how small it is. The battery door is also quite difficult to get off with your finger nail.Now, I understand that this is a very cheap product but I felt that it really wasn't worth it for what it is. Sure, it has a small form factor and it works with all the GoPro mounts. If you absolutely need a camera to work with that system, this might be satisfactory. I don't think that the camera's design gives it a lot of durability and the user interface isn't all that intuitive either.",2,1,2017-9-7,1,2,1

I just got this action camera about a week ago to bring with me on a trip.  I leave for my trip tomorrow morning and I just realized that the water proof case broke.  I've only taken it out of the case to charge.  And somehow the plastic piece that you use to mount the camera broke! I'm so frustrated. I haven't even been able to use it and it has already broken.  How is it suppose to with stand any environment when the case broke on its own while taking the camera out in order to charge it.,1,1,2017-3-9,1,7,1
Great little GoPro for a fraction of the price of a name brand GoPro. The first video was a bit fuzzy but I’m sure it’s user error and not the camera. Easy enough for my son to use- this was a gift for my 10 year old son from his grampa,4,1,2017-12-29,1,0,0

I'm using a Samsung 64gb cards which hold 6 hrs of 1080/30fps video.Unit comes with various mounting brackets.

I was looking for gopro for a cruise trip but found this for half of the price. This is the first time I am using sports camera but I absolutely liked it. The Quality of the picture is great and using it while snorkeling is priceless. having a peace of mind in the water that you are not going to loose $300 camera by accident. The only mistake happened was I always end up running out of battery for the prime time. I realized that I need to plan well and carry more than one battery all the time. The best money I spent for the vacation. Love it!!,5,1,2017-2-4,1,0,0

"I buy so many things on Amazon that I find it cumbersome to write reviews for all of them. Although, I had to review this product after I used it. First of all, I received the package in a day after I placed the order. I planned a ski trip for the weekend and being a beginner/intermediate at skiing, I wanted to record how it feels and also just for the experience. I started looking at GoPro but it was expensive even for a basic model especially when I'm not a professional. Then I saw the Akaso sports camera and from the price point, you just can't beat it. Coming to the quality of it, I thought the pictures and the video would be decent, as with a 12MP camera and a HD video recording capability at 60fps, it can't go bad. To my surprise though, even in the cloudy weather I got some really good pictures. The wide angle camera is just great. I need not worry about which way my camera should point as it covers a lot of area. I later took a video too and I loved it. Apart from the camera in general, there are a ton of accessories that come with it which are really useful. Overall, I definitely recommend this product not only from a price point but also after being satisfied with the quality of it.",5,1,2017-1-31,1,4,1

I was given this camera as a gift for the holidays. I have used it a few times so far and am very happy with the camera as well as the accessories it comes with. The wrist band is an awesome option to use while shooting and I have not see that with many other cameras. I will be looking into getting more accessories shortly. The app is not the most well designed but it is easy to pair and is convenient. Overall I am more than satisfied.,4,1,2017-12-20,1,0,0

"Received the camera Thursday Apr.6. Was working great, really can't complain. Took about 15 to 20 videos  with it all weekend and all looked great. Battery was low so decided to put it to charge and that's where the problem started. Went to unplug it because it had been charging for about 4+ hrs and camera won't turn on. Thinking maybe I put it charge wrong or didn't plug it in right, I plugged it back on and tried to turn it on. Once plugged camera turned on fine and showed that battery is full. As soon as I unplug it, boom! Off again. Tried this again, and just like before it would turn on while plugged and once unplugged it would turn right back off. Thinking maybe it's the battery that's messed up I went and grabbed the other battery and replaced it with the old one. Result? The same as before! Only this time when I unplug it and try to turn it on, it stays in the presentation screen, the ""Akaso EK7000"" screen. Needless to say I will be returning this camera and I'm pretty dissapointed by this. Thanks but no thanks Akaso.",2,1,2017-4-9,1,5,0
Camera is overall great deal. 2.7k at 30 frames is perfect for clear recordings. 1080p @ 60 frames is great for fast moving videos. Great price and comes with many accessories. I’ll definitely recommend this as a starter sport camera.,4,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0

"I wanted to get a GoPro, but the price point was too high for me to consider. I was about to pull the trigger on the GoPro Hero, when this guy showed up.  It had all the things the GoPro didn't have.  4K video, WiFi connectivity and a bunch of accessories.  I was able to try it out last night.  I used it to shoot some footage at home, a YouTube video.  I made the mistake of leaving it in the Waterproof case for this, which muffled my voice, my mistake.  I took it out and gave it another try, the audio picked up just fine.  You get 2 batteries, and at 1080P 60fps, I'd say that's a couple hours of video based on what I shot last night, probably a little more.  I haven't tried 4k yet, but obviously, the better the quality, the more power consumed.It says on the packaging that it supports up to a 32GB micro SD card, but I bought a 64GB card and that is working just fine.  I did notice that the videos shoot in chunks instead of one long video.  depending on the quality you choose, the length of the video in this chunk will be longer, but the size is the same, nearly 1.7 GB.  I happen to like this, it helps to find what you are looking for when putting videos together.  You will find some reviews that say the video keeps restarting, but this is by design apparently, and from what I read, is similar to GoPro behavior.",5,1,2016-12-2,1,3,0
Product takes excellent videos and still shots. Have not used it underwater as of yet but plan to next week to scope out our boat bottom.

Amazing customer service I opened the box and one of the mounts was over tightened so it was broken. They replaced it right away. I just sent a picture and that was it!Very easy to use quick charge and two batteries makes for an easy time. Very durable when I went snorkeling it was very strong waves and at one point I hit the rocks with the camera not a scratch to the case. There was only three down sides in my mind one is that it always starts in video mode not camera and you can't change the boot option. I like photo more than video but that is just me. Second is the ability to click and have a focused picture but this is not a sport camera so don't compare the two. Finally they have an app for the phones to use for wifi pictures. Not their app but the one they recommend it is slow to respond like you push the button you hear click on the phone pause and then click on the camera.,5,1,2017-8-8,1,1,1

We ordered this for our 10 year old son who is always on the go and wants to capture his adventures. For a 10 year old this is perfect and doesn't cost as much as a genuine GoPro. It came with everything we needed to get him started. The only thing that I did not like was the fact that the camera had come loose during the shipping process and was rattling around in the plastic box. I would definitely recommend this to others.,5,1,2017-12-26,1,0,0

"I'll keep this short, as I really don't have much to talk about. Overall I think it's a really good deal, considering the features you get for the price. In the box there's a small booklet that asks you to post a 5 star rating for free accessories, which made me skeptical of the positive reviews on Amazon. However, I think it does live up to the positive reviews. My main complaint has to do with the customer service. The waterproofing case that comes with the camera came with severe scratches, especially where the camera lens sits, which significantly affects the video quality. Believing that it must be pre-owned (which was not acceptable considering that I paid full price), I sent them an email about the issue and they replied quickly. However, after giving them what they asked for (store name, order number, etc.), they have gone dark... So now I'm stuck with this pre-owned, scratched up case that destroys the video quality no matter what I do. Inspect your item carefully once you get it for such signs.",3,1,2016-12-17,1,5,0

This is a fantastic alternative to a GoPro if you are on a budget. I’ve had 2 GoPros in the past and this is just as comparable. Thing that makes this camera better is that it’s about $150 cheaper.,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

I purchased the Akaso Sport Camera mainly to use while hunting.  So far my biggest complaint is that the directions for some of the features/settings are very vague that is why I gave it a 4 star.  As a novice pointing and shooting the camera on my cell phone is about the extent of my knowledge of cameras. The few details explaining how to use the features/settings is pretty frustrating.  I did find several youtube videos that were really helpful figuring out most of the features.I used the camera for the first time the other day while out rabbit hunting with a buddy and his dogs.  I was really impressed with the quality of the video.  Playing the day back on my computer the video was so clear and crisp I could see every pine needle and blade of grass.  The sound even surprised me.  On the video I can clearly hear my buddy and my conversations even though he was 20 plus yards away and the dogs barking 50 to 75 yrds away.,4,1,2017-1-5,1,1,0

"So far the video and picture quality looks god-awful. The ""4k"" barely passes for something resembling grainy sort-of hd video, the 720 setting makes it look like a camcorder from the 90s, if even that good. Most cellphones nowadays take much clearer and better quality pics and videos than this cheap camera.Then theres the wifi connectability, which is a joke. To use the camera with your phone you need an app that they completely stopped updating so it only works on phones still running OS's from 3 years ago, nothing current. Didnt find that out until i bought it and tried to download it of course.",2,1,2017-2-18,1,2,0
"This camera is straight garbage. I've noticed some negative feedback regarding the battery, but that was never a problem for me because the camera would freeze up after 15 minutes max of video time (even at the lowest bit rate, 720p@60 Hz). If you long-pressed the front button, you could get it to re-start, but at this point your file system would usually be corrupted, and you're unable to retrieve your files. I've tried three different brands of class 10 micro SD cards (SanDisk 64gb, Samsung 128gb, Lexar 32gb). Oh, and the ""Ez iCam"" Android app won't connect to the camera. If you are unfortunate enough to already own this camera, for what it's worth I discovered some other Android apps that will actually connect - ""iSmart DV"", ""SBCapp"" and ""iSport Cam"".I think all the positive reviews are disingenuous.

"First off let me thank all of those before me for the wonderful reviews for this budget action camera.  I recently purchased the EK7000 camera and have only played around with it at home for a few hours, but was immediately impressed.  The camera is easy to use with simple menu's that are navigated from button's on the camera.  I was able to figure out how to navigate the menu's without looking at the user manual.  Evidently Akaso assumed most users would figure this out right away because the user manual is not very detailed, but the instructions are sufficient if you need them for reference.  Video quality appears to be what I would consider ""very good"" in comparison to some of the older action camera's I have used.  I don't own a GoPro, so I can not compare the two, but there are several great reviews on Amazon and Youtube of folks comparing the two and I felt from what I saw that the Akaso is actually better than the GoPro for video clarity, sharpness and color.  This definitely helped with my decision to purchase the Akaso.The camera came with several different mounts and accessories which was very nice.  Instructions with the camera on how the accessories go together were not very clear, but for most you will figure it out!  We also purchased a separate accessory pack for some additional mounts we felt we might need.  We are using a Sandisk Ultra Micro SDXC 64GB card with the camera and it appears to accept it with no problems.  The manual mentions the camera will accept 8GB, 16GB and 32GB, but as mentioned, the 64GB appears to work just fine.  The camera most likely will not be concerned about the size of the card but may be more picky about the quality and the speed of the card! If in question, you should check with Akaso customer service (cs@akasotech.com).",5,1,2017-2-2,1,0,0

"This camera is more trouble and frustration than it's worth, due to a software flaw that routinely fails to save the movies you record with it. I have missed out on capturing a lot of exciting memories on video because the camera only saves the movies you record about 60% of the time. Reformatting my micro SD cards in or out of the camera did not resolve the problem, which was unpredictable and seemingly occurs at random. Image quality is passable in bright sunlight, but in shade or low light the quality drops precipitously. Build quality is fine.",1,1,2017-4-1,1,5,0
"I had purchased one of these cameras to add to my live music recording capabilities (shots of drummers and high birds eye) and after trying it out one time during a production, I ordered more. Although i would defiantly not call this a 4k camera because the quality is not that, but it looks really nice at 1080p at 30fps. Other than that i am happy with the product, its a good value. I do wish however you can turn off the screen while recording in order to save on battery power. I will attach a video i shot of a friend playing the national anthem at a basketball game that i used the camera clipped onto the guitar.",4,1,2017-1-25,1,5,0

Second time I've ordered and returned this product now - each time I've received it has clearly been used and scratched up! Waterproof case has scratched and the camera itself has scratches all over the screen. I'm paying for a NEW product that's what I expect to receive!!,1,1,2017-6-1,1,1,0

"It comes with a water proof casing which is very handy for my snorkeling trip. It even comes with 1 spare batteries. The video quality is decent with good lighting and it is very simple to use. The image is distorted but I guess it is common for camera with very wide angle (~170), and it is fine for my underwater video. The battery door is hard to open and is not easy to change the battery while moving. Overall, it is a camera with great value and I am happy with it.",4,1,2016-12-10,1,0,0

"The unit I received connected to WiFi twice, and then stopped connecting. I tried rebooting the unit, rebooting my iPhone, and couldn't get it to connect. Customer service was unresponsive.

"Really small and lightweight with a nice rubbery suede-like body. Simple to use and configure, and the wrist remote is fantastic. All of the accessories, mounts and spare battery it comes with make it a great buy. The LCD screen makes viewing what you are snapping vid or photos of a breeze and it has a playback feature to review with. It also has an iOS/Android app which connects via WiFi, remote controls the camera and has a realtime video feed that is perfect for adjusting the tilt of the camera when it is mounted on your head.The action cam is awesome and takes clear and crisp video. Now I can easily shoot some video while riding my bicycle and I am going skiing next week and looking forward to wearing the action cam on my head for some point-of-view vid of the slopes!",5,1,2017-1-29,1,1,1
Directions are not that good. The app to upload the videos keeps loosing connection. When we tried to upload the video to Facebook we are still having issues. I am not sure if it's the phone or ap but when we try to listen to the video you cannot hear the audio. The audio can be heard through the ICam itself. The main issue we have though is the icam app. It freezes or looses connection. The quality of the video is great though. Wish there was more details to figure this out better.,3,1,2016-12-30,1,0,0

"I loved my GoPro hero3, however on a recent trip to Kona the camera was knocked out of the waterproof case on a rock and got wet.

"I ordered this camera to take to the Bahamas in a few weeks to use for snorkeling. I am a little disappointed, as straight out of the box, the water proof case already had scratches on the lens portion and effects the picture quality. Also, as I tried to gently open the battery compartment door to put the battery in, the very fragile latch broke… so not really what I was expecting… contemplating returning this camera and looking for a different one that is more durable.. I am a professional videographer and photographer, so I know how to insert and remove batteries, this shouldn’t have broke this easily… I did glue it back together , but not sure it will hold",2,1,2017-5-13,1,5,1
