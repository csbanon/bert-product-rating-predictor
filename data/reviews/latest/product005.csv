"I bought this over the more powerful Anker one because this one is ""Amazon's Choice"" do not make the same mistake as I.With no case on (and I always have a case) I could get the phone to charge if it was perfectly in the center and rotated a bit.  However this is for bedside use and I want to be able to place it on it however I want and not have to worry.",1,1,2019-5-5,1,2,0
"After going through several micro USB charging cables I decided it was time to charge my phone wirelessly. This thing works like a charm charges quickly with no hiccups on my S7 edge. Grip pads are great, no sliding :). Does what I want, and am a happy customer.We will see how it holds up, but so for so good",3,1,2018-7-13,1,3,0
"Used this item for only a couple days before it started having issues. Should have guessed that would be the case when we got it and it appeared to have been previously opened. Guessing that someone else got it before us and sent it back. We sent it back because it would get really hot and then stop working after only about 20 minutes. Then, it just stopped working at all.",1,1,2018-12-18,1,2,0
"When I first got it, I thought it was great because my Samsung Galaxy S6 Plus said ""fast wireless charging.""  I never seen a fast wireless charging display on my phone before.  But after a day of used, I begin to examine the speed.  To my surprise even though it says ""fast wireless charging,"" it says 52 min until fully charged even though it's 77%.  So then I took the phone away and charge it on another wireless pad that I had (slow one).  This one didn't say fast wireless charging.  To my surprise, it took the same amount of time as the ""fast wireless charging,"" 52 mins at 77%.  So what's going on?  The standard wireless took about the same time as the fast wireless.  Something ain't right.  Definitely not happy.  The only reason I want this fast wireless is to speed up charging.  But now i found out it took the same amount of time as my slow wireless pad, what's the point of owning this crap?  I got to return if I can't resolve this...something ain't right.  By the way, I am using the Samsung Fast Adaptive Charger, so it show work just fine because it shows 9.0V--1.67A....which is what is needed for fast charging.",1,1,2019-6-25,1,1,0
"I noticed when I first bought it a review stating the charger had burned a ring into their phone case. I was very worried about this but still wanted to try it so I left it on the charger only when I was awake and in the room so I would smell anything going wrong. I'm going to guess that person received a defective unit, which is scary but does happen with any electronics, even Apple branded things. I think we all know it happens with Samsung. Regardless, I've had mine for I believe 3 months now and have had no overheating issues and it charges my phone very quickly. I haven't tested it, but it seems to charge faster than a wire. Again, could be wrong, just my untested observation. I've had no real issues with it, other than the pad being overall kind of small and sometimes you have to poke it a little so it's actually in a charging position. The battery and charger need to be aligned for it to work, naturally. Spending more money on a bigger one would save you those few seconds of potential hassle. Though 90% of the time you just put it down and it starts charging. I would highly recommend this if you just want to test wireless chargers before dropping some crazy amount on a quality one.Update:",5,1,2019-1-1,1,1,0
"I was excited because this charger had really good reviews, but the first time I tried to use it my phone started to smell burnt. I had left it on the charger for maybe 5 minutes when I noticed the smell from a few feet away. It wasn't very strong, but it was noticeable. I took my phone off the charger right away, and asked for a replacement. I got the replacement a few days later, and tried it again. After maybe 10 seconds I took my phone off the charger and smelled it. It definitely smelled burnt, although faint. I am disappointed in this product and I don't know how it has this many stars. If it had just been one broken one I could understand, but being two in a row seems fishy.",1,1,2019-5-9,1,1,0
"I bought a two pack of these chargers to use with a Samsung Galaxy S8, and a S9. Both phones have different branded covers. There is a 70/30 chance they will fully charge before disconnecting from your phone. Also, EXACT placement is critical to get it to charge. Even an 1/8"" off, it won't connect. The only other complaint I have is the green power light is very bright in a dark room. It does go out after a minute, but is known to disconnect and reconnect several times a night. Each time luminating the green light, as well as your phone screen. I still use one of the chargers occasionally, but have since switched to a stand up type charger that is spot on every time.UPDATE: I added 2 more stars for the good customer service.  After leaving my initial review, and rating of 3 stars, I was contacted by  a Yootech representative, who wanted to make sure I was 100% satisfied. I was sent a different model charger (the stand up style), and it works perfect. It isn't finicky like the puck style. You can plop your phone down on it and it connects instantly. You can also tell that it is well made, as soon as you take it out of the box. Compared to other stand up chargers I use, this one is heavy. It also has the rubber ring around the base to keep it from moving around on the table.",5,1,2018-12-28,1,8,0
"I was super excited to be able to wirelessly charge my new iPhone XR; this charger works great and I like that it verifies that the phone is charging by vibrating and flashing the green light. It was also the least expensive option out of all the wireless chargers with 4+ stars on amazon.THINGS TO KNOW: One thing that I did not account for was my pop socket-- it looks like the Qi wireless charging technology is not yet compatible with some cases or with pop sockets. You might want to make sure that your phone cases is compatible with wireless charging before purchasing. Additionally, please recognize that the phone needs to be centered on the charging pad to work.",4,1,2018-12-22,1,9,0
"Excellent choice for a wireless charger.  Set it up without looking at the instructions.  I'm impressed how compact, lightweight, and well made this charger is for the price point..  My XS max charges quickly even without taking the case off.  Fits inconspicuously on any table big or small.  Black matte color further makes it almost unnoticeable.  I like the soft green light that signals the phone is set on the charger correctly and the connection is made.  The light goes out after a few seconds along with the soft beep.  This is a must have charger for wireless phones.  Charging is quick. Highly recommend.",5,1,2018-11-23,1,9,0
"I bought one for the novelty. It worked once. After this, it would turn on for a few seconds then die. It thought it might be that my power adaptor might not have the requisite wattage so I ordered a couple 27 watt jobbies. Still no joy.  I returned it and ordered one with better reviews (also more costly but that also included a high power wall adaptor). Stay tuned!",1,1,2018-12-8,1,1,0
"I've bout two of these.  The first came as advertised and so far has been a good purchase.  However, the second charger I recived was not this device at all.  it was a Yootech device but looked very different and was shockingly cheap in construction - returned without using it.  If you get the device that matches the picture it will probably be good but given I am 50% on getting the right product I think I would recommend looking at another device as there are plenty of good ones out there.",3,1,2018-7-4,1,1,0
This product only worked for a few days. It would get really hot then not work at all. Then it would start charging then stop then start again then stop. Became aggravatingz,1,1,2018-8-21,1,1,0

"This charger came in, I was excited! Opened it, plugged it in, didn’t work!! So I thought MAYBE the cord was the problem. Still didn’t work. Even tried changing the box (even though I just got it & it had never been used) still doesn’t work. I know I didn’t pay a lot for the charger so it’s kinda expected, but I was sooo excited to try a wireless charger & the SOB doesn’t even work.",1,1,2018-12-9,1,7,0
"I gave this product a 5 star review only after 1-day of use, which was a mistake.  After about a week of use, something is wrong with the charger.  I left my iPhone XR on this wireless charger to be charged overnight when I went to sleep.  It was working good for the first few days.  However, in the past 2 days (2 days in a row), when I wake up in the morning and reach for my phone, both the charger and the back of my phone were extremely hot!!  Additionally, which is a bigger concern, there was an obvious definite electrical burning smell coming from the charger!!  Dangerous!!  I'm not taking any chances with this charger that might burn/melt and damage my phone.  Thus, I'm returning this charger immediately today for a refund.  I'm sorry but I have no choice but to revise the previous 5 star positive review down to 1 star negative review.",1,1,2019-3-28,1,5,0
"Ok, I like the concept and it works really well.  It is super convenient.  The only downside is that it is much less convenient if you need to use your phone while charging as it must stay on the charger.  I actually still use a wired charger a good bit when in bed just so that I can use the phone for a little while and still charge.  If you like the convenience of just setting your phone down to charge, this is a great option and would work well at an office desk for sure.  It really makes me want to go with a wireless charger in my vehicle.***********************************************************************************************************************************************",4,1,2019-5-13,1,5,0
"I had it plugged in to the cable in my car. I hadn't used it that morning. When I went to unplug it to take it in to work  the plug was extremely hot. It wasn't even charging a phone, just sitting there on the console. I purchased based on ratings and reviews so this is just a fluke but the potential is there.",1,1,2019-3-1,1,5,1
"This thing kind of worked for a couple weeks, but now doesn't work hardly at all. It never worked well requiring so many adjustments for the phone to be placed an absolutely precise way so that it charged at all. Now, it doesn't charge the phone above about 60% despite hours of charging. Of course, it's outside of the return window, so I'm stuck with this thing. Don't make the same mistake as me and avoid this product.UPDATE 2/19: The company contacted me after this review and offered a refund. I accepted so will add a star to acknowledge their commitment to customer service.",2,1,2018-11-15,1,4,0
"The ONLY reason I am giving this one star is because I just purchased two of these only to find out that they DO NOT work with the aluminum heavy duty case I just purchased for my Samsung Note 9 phone. The instructions on the packet say remove any metal from your phone case but I haven't been able to see that anywhere else in the description of the product or anywhere else. So, now I have two wireless charging pads, that won't work with my phone unless I remove it from the case, which requires un-screwing a total of 8 crews from the front of the case. I'll be selling these.",1,1,2019-4-30,1,9,0
"If you want to fast charge your compatible iPhone or Samsung phone, this charger will do the trick - provided you follow their directions.CABLES:  The Yootech charger comes with a USB-A to micro USB cable that's engineered to work with the Qualcomm Quick Charge (QC) standards. It's visibly indistinguishable from a legacy cable so you may want to mark it. When it comes to fast charging over USB, most legacy USB cables won't work.  Using this Yootech charger and a quality QC compliant power adapter, I can't get it to fast charge with several of my legacy cables.  I assume the charger or the power adapter can sense if the cable is compliant or not. Bottom line is you'll need to use this cable or another one that meets the QC standard if you intend to wirelessly fast charge an iPhone or any of the 10W Android phones that the seller lists.",5,1,2018-4-22,1,1,1
"Only had it a couple weeks but seems to work flawlessly. I have a leather case with a plastic backing and it fast charges my S8+ perfectly. Wireless charging is not as fast as plugged in, to be expected. Silly to spend so much more for a branded charger if you already have the wall adapter.",5,1,2018-5-10,1,7,0
Awesome charger!  Much slimmer than my Samsung version.  I bought this for a mod on my Toyota Tacoma... now I have wireless charging in the console.  I liked it so much that I purchased another.,5,1,2018-7-11,1,5,1
"I love this charger!Charges my iPhone 8 Plus with my Otter Box Defender case on it, the light comes on when you first set the phone down on it and then goes off which is perfect on my nightstand next to my bed.",5,1,2018-9-5,1,3,0
"I read a few of the reviews that stated that the charger quit working fairly quickly, but I figured for $15 it would be worth a shot. So far I'm having no troubles aside from the fact that it doesn't want to seem to work with some brick adapters (the little thing you plug into the wall with the USB plug for your phone cable). I plugged the charger into the brick that came with my Galaxy S8 and the wireless charger would cease working after a few seconds, but when I swapped it to the old brick that had come with my Galaxy S7, it started working again right away and hasn't stopped. I'm thinking this may possibly be the issue that some reviewers had regarding the wireless charger suddenly and mysteriously not working within a few days of purchase, but I can't be sure for obvious reasons. I'm not sure why this would be aside from maybe incompatible technology, but a brick is a brick, so who knows? If you do buy this wireless charger, try to use an older brick, not one of the newer ones. If you use a newer brick and the charger stops working, try swapping to an old one before complaining or demanding your money back.One thing I really like about this is that the light ring around the base lights up when you set your phone on it to signal that your phone is now charging, but the light turns off after a few seconds (Phone continues to charge). It's difficult for me to sleep with light sources in my room and I keep my phone basically right next to my head to make sure I don't accidentally miss my alarms, so this is a god send.",5,1,2018-12-14,1,6,0
"Bought this to use w/my Samsung S9. I love wireless charging that this pad does what it promises, I like that the green light temporarily illuminates when you place your device on it.The only issue I have is that you must place your phone right in the middle of the circle with the edges hanging over equidistant on the top and bottom (at least that was the case w/my S9). There were a couple of occasions when I checked my phone at night while half-asleep in bed and I did not place it exactly on the pad, thus ended up not charging. I'm sure this is common across all other flat charger bases like this one. I decided to go with a vertical stand model instead as placement should be a little easier to center on the base.",4,1,2018-12-3,1,7,0
"I can tell half of the reviews must be paid reviews because this charger is horrible. I understand it doesnt charge as fast as the lightening cord but when i put it to charge before i go to bed 8 hours later and all i get is 45% battery life ??? my phone was at 50% when i put it on the charger !!! (and yes im making sure when i set it down that it is connected) Good idea, horrible product. Will be returning and buying a better quality brand.",1,1,2019-9-12,1,8,0
"Amendment to original review:I was contacted by the company about the issues I was having. They asked if they could send me a replacement, free of charge, to see if a new one worked better. I was open to this,  as its possible mine had some kind of defect. I received a new one in the mail just a couple of days later, and it works great.  They didn't send me the same model,  but a newer, stand-up version. I really like it, as you can just set your phone on it without having to worry about placing it just right to get it charging (unlike the lay down model). The customer service was great,  and I really appreciate their efforts to rectify what I saw as a minor issue. Highly recommend, changed to 5 ☆☆☆☆☆",5,1,2019-1-20,1,6,0
Works but incessant green blinking once charged is annoying. No one wants a blinking light to start up in the middle of the night. I will be ditching this and looking for another!UPDATE: I cannot be sure that the problem may not be due to my own sloppy use in combination with a phone case and perhaps the device itself being sensitive to proper phone placement. The behavior was as if the phone was being lifted off then put back on the charger so perhaps the on/off blinking behavior was due to intermittent syncing between phone and charger when placement was not exact.,4,1,2018-12-28,1,6,0
"I needed a second wireless charger. This one was fairly well reviewed, so I got one. I was impressed on day one. It'll charge as well as my other one on my brand-name power, but I've got no numbers for ya. The S8 batt. is older, and doesn't charge quite as fast as when it was new. Add to that I'm not gonna do any detailed testing. IMNSHO this is a decent charger, adequate for whatever power you plug it into. Better power = faster charge.So, it charges through my Otterbox, and there's a silicone strip on top and bottom to hold your gadget and hold the charger to a smooth surface fairly well. Cable plug is snug, secure. Lights up nicely when I put S8 on it, then goes out, no annoying always-on thing. Apart from those, not much left to say. Well, one thing. Wireless charging spoiled the ol' lady and I. Beats the carp outta fiddling with plugs, wires and sh... tuff. Try it, y'all, you'll see.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,3,0
"If you're just putting your phone on to charge when you go to bed and/or don't care how long it takes to charge, you might be happy with this, but compared to a normal charging cord, this thing charges WAY too slowly. I'm returning. :(",1,1,2018-12-13,1,1,0
"After doing extensive research I decided to buy this Yootech 7.5W Wireless Charger for iPhone X/8/8 Plus,10W for Samsung Galaxy S9/S9. I have an iPhone X and wanted to try out the wireless charging featured. I paired it with a 5V 2A AC Power adapter ( thehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0119BUJDQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ). I don't need the fast charge feature, so that is why I purchased this power adapter. I leave my phone charging overnight on my nightstand. I have a spigen clear polycarbonate case on my phone. The phone connects and starts charging every time I place it on the charger. I like the fact that the status light turns of after it starts charging for about 15 seconds, so the light doesn't disturb my sleep. My phone has not gotten hot while it is charging. Overall, I am very impressed with this charger for the price and features. I have only had it for a few weeks, so I can't review longevity of it. At this point, I would highly recommend it to others and buy it again.",5,1,2018-8-6,1,5,0
I purchased the iPhone XS Max and wanted a 7.5w wireless charger that was it too expensive for my nightstand. The Yootech fit the bill. It was easy to setup and use - just plug it into the wall adaptor (not included) and place the iPhone on the charging pad. Works through my iPhone silicone case and I like the green light which shows it’s charging. I’ve been using the Yootech for over two months without an issue. Charges fast and easy without the hassle of plugging in each time.,5,1,2018-12-21,1,4,1

Works great with my iPhone XS Max. I use this charger every night and have had no problems. I ordered another one for the office.,5,1,2018-12-16,1,2,1
"Good product, does what it’s supposed to do. If you are looking for fast charging I would not recommend but if you don’t care and not in  hurry to get your phone charged super fast this does the job. So far no problems, hopefully they last a long time.",5,1,2019-1-16,1,1,0

"It asked me for face recognition in this review. Unsure what that’s about as it’s a wireless charger?? It’s be good for traveling since it’s simply a little disk and a cord. It completely BAFFLES me why these products don’t come with the wall adapter. It actually quite ticks me off (makes no sense, it’s required!) Luckily I had to buy extras for all the other products that also don’t inluce the adapters. *major eye roll* One star off for inconvenience, even though they stated it doesn’t come with one I consider that BS.  Material quality seems fair. Doesn’t feel cheap but also isn’t heavy as a brick. I have a case on mine where they instruct you to REMOVE any debit/credit cards to avoid melting so I do that. Case is kinda thick (Spigen). Not worth the risk of damaging my cards. I also have a pop socket on my case which makes it too thick to charge. But I just open the panel for my cards to get the pop socket out of the way and it charges just fine. The light doesn’t stay on the entire time just when you first connect it which is nice if you use over night. Convenient!",4,1,2019-3-18,1,2,1
"This charger heats up my Samsung S7 while charging, and both phone and charger are abnormally warm/hot.  It charges, but my phone never gets this hot an another generic (Pleson or Samsung) wireless charger.  I was using the ""USB-C"" port on my monitor to power the charger (using USB-C to USB-C cable).I've just switched to a USB-A to USB-C and connected to my PC, and it seems to fix the hot issue, but I need to test a fe more times to be sure..",4,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"So I've had this charger now for well over a year and can honestly say it is the best wireless charger I have. I actually have 4 different qi chargers from four different companies. The other three look fancy and high tech, like one of them is a clock/pen holder and was pretty pricey while my yoothech charger seems small and flimsy. In the end, though I can tell you that the yootech charger is hands down the better charger. The reason why is that on the fancier chargers I keep having to move my phone around the charging pads until it finally alerts me that it is charging. Then minutes later it stops charging all on its own and I have to move my phone around again to start the charging process. I've tried everything and the only thing that works is to remove my phone case every time I start charging my phone, and I actually have a pretty slim phone case!!! Now with the small seemingly plain yootech charger I set it on there on the right spot for the phone and leave it and it charges from beginning to end without interruption. I also like how when you have it in the right spot a bright green light turns on telling you that the charging has started. With all my other chargers it's mostly a guessing game if you have it on the right spot for charging. My guess is that all the other chargers aren't putting out a strong enough current to work with most phone cases, while the yootech charger is putting more or is somehow stronger. I would be willing to bet that you could even put thicker phone cases on the yootech charger. I hope this helps someone out.",5,1,2019-9-21,1,1,1

"My phone doesn't always start charging after each time that I put it on the wireless charger, I often times have to pick it up and lay it down 1 or 2 more times before it registers.

"Recently upgraded to the iPhone XS Max after somehow getting through 4 years with the 6 Plus and decided wireless charging is one of the ""perks"" of such an upgrade. I don't use the phone all that much compared to my iMac and MBP and being that I live in SoCal, I constantly have the phone plugged in for charging in the car so it's actually very rare my phone's battery falls below 90% during the day. Even during my 2~3 week business trips to Asia which I make 3~4 times per year, the battery level rarely falls below 70%.So, fast charging is not a necessity for me although it's certainly a nice feature. I can tell that this doesn't charge all that fast but I look at it as an office desk and bedside charger and it does just fine for such usage. It really is nice to lay the phone down on this pad. When I pick up the phone, it's at 100% and ready for a full day or two.",5,1,2018-12-29,1,1,0

"In comparison with the cable, it's a MUCH slower charging speed. Also may be a problem if you keep credit cards in the back of your phone case. For me the iPhoneX will not charge face down, only if I put the back of the phone on the pad, but on the back I have my ID and a credit card that I was not going to take in and out all the time. The chip on the credit card stopped working after I used this charger for a couple of days, so I am returning it. The charging pad and the phone also get very hot. If you don't have credit cards on the back of your case and don't mind significantly slower than cable charging speed then it could work for you just fine. On the plus side it charged even with a thick two layer phone case with two cards on the back, although you have to position your phone just right on the pad (can't just plop it down, have to adjust the position just so for the charging to kick in)",2,1,2020-1-8,1,3,0

"I bought this to charge my phone by my bedside. I gave this four stars because it works well when you can get it to connect properly. When connected, it has a solid green light around the middle. Easy enough.  Sometimes, it will connect, but then it will disconnect later for no seeming reason. When it does that, the green light starts flashing, and its brightness flashing will wake you up. It won't charge after it is blinking and you have to unplug and then plug in again to stop the flashing. Not necessarily what you want to be doing in the middle of the night.However, if you want to use this during the day, I would highly recommend it. You just put your phone on and bam! it charges. It charges through my thinnish case, but won't charge if you have a pop socket on the back, unless the pop socket is placed just so. I just turn my phone face down and it charges fine.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,1,0
This is a product fail. You barely touch it and the phone stops charging. It takes hours and hours and hours for it to charge my iPhone max and note 9. It’s not really wiresless as it has to be plugged into the outlet to charge the phone. I guess the only wireless aspect would be that fact that your phone isn’t connected to a wire while charging.  Over all it’s pretty crappy. I can use my regular charger that came with my phone and be done charging in 30 mins from a dead battery. I. An say though customer service has been a delight to work with. He sent me a replacement and upgraded it to the one that stands up. I like the second one I was sent better but still no rapid charge. However works well for overnight charge.,2,1,2019-1-1,1,5,0
I have arthritis and have had trouble charging my  with the plug in attachment and it was even worse taking out the charger cord.  Hated when I had to charge my phone.  The ease of charging my phone with this wonderful device is fantastic.  Charge actually seems to last longer than before.  Love love love this.  WILL NEVER GO BACK TO OTHER CHARGERS!!!!

I ordered two of these wireless charging pads for Christmas gifts. Both worked perfectly during the initial test run and then both suddenly stopped working after the first use. Rather irritating since I live in Arizona and one of them was a gift to my mom who lives in California so now I have to go through the hassle of having her send it back. Sending both products back for a refund then ordering an Anker wireless charger like I should have in the first place. Very disappointing.,1,1,2018-12-28,1,9,0

"Really like the design of this product with the rubberized rings which help keep the phone from sliding but wish that the item was somewhat larger to accommodate a larger phone.  On occasion, it is difficult to keep a phone level in a case on a small charger.Revision: After using the product with no difficulties for about a month, all of a sudden like a number of users, the charger started to get unacceptably hot. I was forced to discontinue use because I was concerned it might damage my phone.",1,1,2019-2-19,1,6,0
"This has such great reviews so im really disappointed to write that this is one of the worst chargers I've ever used. Maybe I got a defective model but despite it saying ""Fast Charging"" when my phone is set onto it, the charging speed is very, very slow. If I have the phone unlocked while charging, it barely charges faster than it is drained. It also randomly stops charging and the rings blink green. I thought maybe I elbowed my phone on the desk and maybe knocked it off of the pad but I just watched it literally stop on it's own for no reason. Again, really disappointed :/",1,1,2019-9-18,1,5,0
"I’ve had this for months without issue, and use it overnight while I’m sleeping. This morning my cat woke up strangely early and when I reached for my phone, it was VERY hot and there was a hot electrical smell. I ripped the case off the phone and it’s cool now, and unplugged the charger, but I won’t use it again. I hate to think what might have happened if I hadn’t woken up when I did. My cat may have saved my life!",1,1,2019-4-30,1,6,0
"The material that I have purchased off of Amazon was meant to do its job which is to charge most smartphones wirelessly. However, this wireless charger that they have presents for us is not meant for traveling. If you are traveling and if you dare to use this as a charger then you are going to have to be very cautious of how your phone is balance on that wireless pad, because if you are driving you have to make sure that phone is steady as possible. Whether you are driving, on the bus, on the train, even on the airplane, you have to make sure that it is on. And I learned that the hard way. I was on my 7 day cruise and I've been using the wireless charger for at least 4 days out of the 7th Day and everyday when I check to see if my phone is fully charged it is always around 50%, why? Because apparently my phone would slide off of the wireless pad. It does its job overall the material quality I give it a five-star, even the charging power I will definitely give it a five star. But for traveling?  I gave it a rating of two stars. This is why I personally preferred a wired charger than a wireless charger. If you have a wired charger you can charge and play on your phone and do whatever you need to do on your phone on the go, but if you are wirelessly charging your phone you can't be on your phone and charge your phone at the same time, it is impossible and you will have to hold the wireless pad and your phone at the same time if you want to be on it that much.",4,1,2019-4-13,1,1,0

It is the ""...and so on"" that is open to misinterpretation as I did. It does not support fast charging for the S7; the S7 is not QC2 or 3 compatible even when attached to the Samsung Fast Charge wall adapter. The Samsung Fast Charge wall adapter does fast charge the S7.Charge time for S7 with wall adapter (start at 51%) is about 40 min.",2,1,2019-11-26,1,3,0
Today almost a month to the day my charger stopped working. I checked all connections and power source and all is fine. the device just died and won't charge anymore. when I lay the same phone I have been charging with this device for almost a month on it the light doesn't go on and after a while when I check the charge it hasn't changed.

"I purchased this about a month ago.  I've used it with an iPhone 8 and an iPhone X.  It will work about 60-70% of the time.  I'll put my phone on the charger, then I'll have to watch it for a few minutes to make sure it doesn't start flashing green.  If it does, that means that it is no longer charging.  A solid green light for several seconds and it goes out means it should be charging normally.I've had to take my phone off and put it back on up to 5 times for the charging to take.  I would have probably given it less stars, but at least it blinks to let you know that the phone isn't properly charging.",3,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0

I can charge the phone with my case and Pop Socket on (although full disclosure my Pop Socket is on the bottom of my case and not in the middle). If you use a Pop Socket you may have a little trouble getting this to charge without taking your case off. The charging time is no better or worse than my regular charger.

"This is definitely the best wireless charger that I have purchased.  It is easy to place my phone on (I do not have to line it up at the exact center).  It also displays a light when the phone is picking up a charge, which makes it easy to use. I also like that it has a nice rubber grip to it, so I feel like my phone is not going to slide off if I knock the table it is on.  It also charges my phone quickly and is a reliable charging source. :) It is also small and compact, so I often put it in my purse to carry to the office.I also like the fact that it lies flat, since my other wireless charger is a stand -- which makes it difficult to use my phone while it is charging.  This one is easy, and like I said earlier, with the grip, I feel like my phone is secure.",5,1,2018-4-11,1,3,0
"It constantly flashes green, which indicates poor to no charging performance. This is probably due to my thick Otterbox case on my Samsung Galaxy S10e -- if you have this device configuration, this charger won't work for you.Also, regardless of this problem, the downside to this product is that it's a circle shape, so orienting your device on the charger center isn't always precise. Often times, you have to fiddle with position and learn where works best for your device (and remember to use that every time). I'm going to try my luck with different wireless chargers, particularly those that are more rectangular rigid shape to enforce optimal positioning.",1,1,2019-9-23,1,2,0
"Loved it - Until now.  Returned expired jan 31, 2020 and now it stopped charging Feb. 8th!  What a bummer!  Loved it while it lasted but should last longer than 2 months.after writing this review, a couple weeks later the company reached out to me, offering me a gift card if I take my rating down.  I told them, I would take it down but will update with what they offered.  They must have liked my answer because I got a notification from amazon that I had a credit.  - Then the pandemic hit - finally getting around it updating the review.  Feel terrible I took so long... anyway, with the pandemic ""safer at home"" rules, I'm cleaning things out and came across the wireless charger.  My daughter saw it and asked if she could have it, I told her I needed to Recyle it because it doesn't work.  Well maybe it needed a break from charging ?? I'm not sure but it works like a charm now.  When it first broke, I took it to several outlets to make sure it wasn't the power source.  it wasn't.

"***Be sure to read update below too****I purchased the Yootech Wireless Charger Qi-Certified 7.5W Wireless Charging from Amazon and received it Saturday.  I hooked it up and it charged my iPhone XR fine Saturday night.  However, the last two nights it isn't working right.

"I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and so far it's worked pretty great. Charges both my phone and even the bluetooth earbuds very well. So long as you set your device square in the middle of the pad the green light around the pad will light up showing it's charging properly (best to make sure the center of the device meets the center of the pad for best results), and it's small enough that I could probably get away with traveling with it in my pockets. My only complaint is it ""kinda"" works with my case. This is advertised to work with cases up to 4mm thickness and I have a ZIZO Bolt Series case (don't know the thickness), While it seems to work and even continuously work when I stream to from my phone to tv while it's charging, it left alone while changing in the case it will stop and the pad will start flashing. It's a bummer that it doesn't work properly with my case but since it's my first one I deal with taking off the case at night to charge. It's good, but be warned if you have a phone case with any kind of real heft to it.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0

"Bought 2 of these for the bedroom and living room. Overall you probably won't find a better charger for the price (it's quite cheap for the technology). Charges quickly without interruption. My favorite part of the charger is that the base flashes a green light when the phone starts charging so you know it is working. The green light stops flashing in a few seconds, it just works as an indicator.The only downside of this product is that the ""sweet spot"" is somewhat small. You have to put your phone on it in the very center to start charging. Nevertheless, after a few days it was pretty easy to figure out where that is and now I usually put my phone on the charger in the perfect position instinctually (plus the green light flashing always helps ensure it's working)",5,1,2018-12-24,1,3,0

UPDATE TO UPDATE inexplicably it started working again so I went back up to 4 stars.

I opted for a replacement and was happily surprised to not only receive the replacement extremely quickly but also to receive the newest version of this product. I immediately tried it out and was delighted to find my phone charging away within seconds of being put on the charger. I have to say that it charged my phone very quickly from about 30 to 100 in less than an hour. I would totally recommend this. And if you have an issue reach out to the seeker and they will correct it for you.I bought this because my husband has one and loves it. Mine however is just not working the same. He has an Xr and uses his computer to charge his phone. I have an Xs and have attempted several outlets, charger ports ( including the one that came with my phone), several ports on my computer and my husbands computer and nothing. I have even taken the case off my phone thinking that it was that (it’s only a clear silicone case) and nothing. It will light up like it’s charging, but I leave my phone on all night and never get past 35%. On his the phones will be on for 1/2 hour And be near full. I would say this is a quality control thing since they are both the same brand. I personally would not recommend this to anyone and would suggest a different brand",5,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0
"I was skeptical at first, as this was my first ever wireless charging pad. But I have to say, I'm quite impressed at what you get for the price. It's a very solid piece of tech to start, I've had no difficulty with the setup and charging powers at all.As far as the technical aspect goes, the setup is basic but smart. The pad is designed with a non-integrated charging cable, meaning that you're not stuck with the default cable here. This is always a huge bonus as being able to swap the cables is often overlooked but quite important for tech longevity.",5,1,2019-5-24,1,0,0
"I have an iPhone 6 (I know an upgrade is long overdue lol ). I wanted to join the other folks who are living the wireless charging dream. After reviewing many wireless chargers, I decided to give this one a shot since it had the most reviews. Since iPhone 6 doesn't support wireless charging in built, I bought a Qi wireless receiver. I was a little skeptical at first. However I can say that it has been few days now and the charger works extremely well. Its easy to use (just unbox and plug in), looks elegant and the charging works like a charm. It also makes me look super cool when I others see me using it. I just toss my phone on it and it starts charging. I have also tried using it with my laptop. Seems to work well so far. I have a case (<4mm think) on my phone and it charges right through that. These guys definitely seems to have an edge when it comes to wireless chargers. Checkout their site. They have amazing products too. I'm glad I made this purchase.

Found that the phone had to be dead center to charge. Leave it alone and check two hours later...50%. Pick it up and right back down, starts charging again. Takes another three hours to fully charge.

Automatically detected. Green light came on to show it was in charging mode. I’m noted the time, it charged two units/points in nine minutes. My phone was already at 98% -  it went to 100% in nine minutes. So it’s working. Today, I’m satisfied. I will find out over the next 30 days if that continues to be the case.

It's so nice to just set your phone on it at night and if you need to pick it up in the middle of the night, it's easy to just drop it back on without having to mess with any cables or plugs.  When I had to travel recently and use a regular charging cable, I was a little bummed becuase I like it that much.  I have an Otterbox Defender on my iPhone and even with that thick of a case, it works just fine.  That said, it's helping my case last much longer because I'm not opening and closing the flap over the charge port every day.

"Great wireless charger for my iPhone XS. Will definitely purchase another charger as my last iPhone 7s plus had problems with the charging port. I’ll keep one in the kitchen, one next to my bed, and one in my office.Regarding my 7s plus, the Apple technician stated that over time, particles of debris, dust, and lint can become trapped in the lightening cord port and can cause misalignment of the pins when you plug it in to charge. Had I known, I would have had the port professionally cleaned- but who does that?! So, unexpectedly, I was unable to make or receive any calls. The phone is otherwise completely useful and less than two years old. So I bought a new phone in the meanwhile. Needless to say, I don’t have to use the port on the Xs as often as the X is wireless. The wireless charger makes grabbing my phone to check something seem very painless- I always felt limited with the phone connected to the wall charger. Overall, I love how easy it is to charge and it’s very attractive. My husband just got the 8 and it’s wireless, too.  Won’t go back to a traditional charging port.",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0

Both phones charged very fast. The phone cases didn't seem to affect the chargers function at all. The charger has a co continuous rubber rim running along on top and bottom which keeps your phone and charger free from slipping around. In addition there are no annoying continuous lights other than a soft meditative green light which appears when you first place your device on it. Then it turns off after 16 seconds.

I decided I would rather be able to just set my phone on my nightstand instead of the glorious hassle of grabbing the charger cord and trying to stick it in in a dark bedroom (Giggety). I plugged the charger in using the Adapter that came with my IPhone. I knew a better one is needed if you want ""fast"" charging but honestly I didn't care about that and didn't feel like spending more money. It works perfectly. I picked the phone up and set it back down lots of times and it always started charging. I wasn't even careful about centering the phone. I would purposely set it haphazardly to see if it mattered.

There seems to be about 1 inch of ""tolerance"" on positioning it so that it will charge, and the indicator light tells you if you got it right.One thing to note is that if you use a use a magnetic dash mount with your phone, and therefore have a metal plate sandwiched between your phone and its case, that will block this charger from charging the phone. It's a pain to remove the case every time to charge it of course.  I assume this is true of all wireless chargers however.",5,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"I feel silly complaining about the ease of use with a wireless charger, and I wouldn’t even know I had something to complain about, BUT I just purchased another charger for the 3-in-1 use for some of my other devices and have learned what this charger lacks in the phone charging department.The charger works GREAT once you have your phone in the “sweet spot”, but finding that sweet spot sometimes takes longer than just plugging in an actual cord.🤦🏼‍♀️",3,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
The charger worked excellent until today. My phone has been in the charger for 9 hours. And has only charged from 23% to now 37%. It is positioned correctly. I’m using my fast charger and it’s not working. Anyone else can recommend a better one? I think I’ll just return anyway. It’s unreliable.,1,1,2020-6-19,1,2,0
"I purchased the Yootech Wireless Charger on April 12th for $7.95.  At the time I needed an extra charging cord for my iPhone.  Given the (low!) price, it seemed an interesting alternative.HOWEVER, when I went to reorder today (May 1st) the price was $12.95 - a 62 percent increase.  Seems like price gauging in the age of the Corona virus.  Amazon was reported to be watching for this kind of pricing behavior from its providers.  Apparently Amazon missed the Yootech Wireless Charger as part of its ongoing review.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I have a samsung fast charger the vertical one with the cradle, I got it from the ATT store and it does not work with my otterbox case on it, it would work sometimes if I turned it sideways but I could never get it on there right all the time, a huge pain in the butt.This thing I pulled it out, plugged it up, put my phone on there and it worked right away with my otterbox on there, I wish I would of gotten one of these a lot sooner, wireless charging is the bee's knees! It lights up like in the second picture when you put it on and it turns off after a couple seconds, super nice!",5,1,2019-5-1,1,1,1
"Purchased in April 2018, as I wanted a wireless charger for my iPhone.  Came in quickly and well packaged. It comes with the charging base and an approx. 3' charging cord (mini plug at one end and USB at other). You need to provide the charging block/USB end to provide power. The charging base lights up green when plugged in and when a device is placed on it and starts charging. The bottom is non-skid, which keeps the charging base from sliding around. With a case on my phone, I have to move the device around a bit to make sure it starts charging.  The green ""charge"" light helps to determine when I make that connection.  The light goes out after a short period, so it won't be disruptive.Ordered a second charger for my wife 3-4 months ago and hers is also humming along nicely.  Both perform flawlessly.",5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,1
"Bought it for a Huawei Nova phone and it didn't work for some reason. Gave it to my daughter who tried it with her Huawei P30 Pro as well as tested it on iPhone 6 & 6s+ and it worked for those phones. To be honest, she wished this little device could just be charged and hold a charge for easy wireless charging without a cord when on the move. On the pro side, I suppose this does save cords from being bent and the need to replace them. But overall, I see limited use for our purposes. It's an alright product for what it is. I probably would have returned it since it is useless to me and my daughter seemed indifferent about keeping it but I missed the return window.",3,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Update: I've had this charger for several months now, and it is still working great! No complaints. One of the things I like most is that it doesn't have any lights on it, so I can keep it on my beside table and charge through the night.Original review: I really like this charger for the price. It charges my Samsung phone just fine with a case on it. I was having trouble with my phone’s USB port, and this charger provided a great solution for charging. I will update my review later to share about durability since I only purchased this a week ago, but for now I really like the way this performs.",5,1,2019-3-7,1,1,0
"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he hasn’t complained! This charging pad is wonderful! It lights up green to signal that it is charging, and then the light shuts off a few seconds later. You just plug it in and place your phone on top! It charges through cases, even through my super big silicone case. My only critique is that it is not a fast charge by any means. It takes all night, so this pad is useful for bedtime.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,1,0
"It's got a great form factor, comes with cables, and is super convenient now that I have more wireless charging tech in the house. My only complaint is that it is not as powerful. My Galaxy S9 takes around 3 hours to full charge on this vs 1hr 40min on direct connection with same ac adapter. I get that that's a part of the tech, but it's still a bit disappointing. It more than makes up for it in convenience in that I can put my phone down and just forget it for a while and then swap in some headphones or something else when I need it again. I just want to caution people to not expect super fast charging speeds.",4,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"This is a rave review, despite the 2nd paragraph!!I purchased two Qi-chargers for my home, and one as a gift.

It is small, extremely lightweight, and is excellent for transport/travel.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,1
"I finally decided to buy a wireless charger and this one in WONDERFUL.  It's great that it came with a quality USB C cable since I didn't own any and it charges my old S7 Edge pretty darned quickly.  It's a little finicky about having your phone in the right place but that may be partially due to the Otterbox case I have my phone in.An unexpected benefit is since this is the only thing in my house with USB C it means I don't ""borrow"" the cable to use for something else, lol.

"This is the third time that I've ordered one of these chargers and am very pleased again. In the past, I had to keep replacing my phones, because the port at the bottom would wear out/ break so the phone was unable to be charged and I had to go buy a whole new phone. With these, you just set the phone on it and it charges. I just ordered a third one because the charging port on my Galaxy S9 has worn down from plugging/unplugging in my phone while driving and using my GPS and doesn't work anymore. So I just got another one of these and set it on my dash and charge my phone in the car with it too. So overall very impressed.

"Great item, I actually bought it to replace my older Yootech model wireless charger and I was not disappointed. My older Yootech wireless charger was starting to fail after 4+ years and I wanted to change it and get some updated technology. My older model was not charging as well anymore and I needed to find the sweet spot before I could get it to charge my phone.This new model is awesome and I use it to charge my phone as well as my airpods. The build on it is sturdy and very good quality. As soon as I drop my phone on it the charger takes over. I always wake up to a full charge and the phone does not feel hot when I pick it up.

This is an update of a 3-star review I originalLy posted -I thought I had a failure of one of the two chargers I had bought 8 months ago but I was mistaken.  It is my iPhone that has quit working on an inductive charger - NOT the Yootech charger's fault.,5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0

I will say the charge is a little slower than the cord but I do have a full charge when I wake up in the morning.The one thing I wish was different was that the green light doesn't stay on the whole time, only for a few seconds to show you that your phone is successfully charging. Or it would be cool if the light turned green when the phone was at 100% charged.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
I bought this so I did not continually have to plug my phone in to charge it and thus wear out the plug.  I expecially like the feedback it gives users.  When plugging it in it flashes to let you know it has power.  When you put the phone on it also flashes to let you know it is in the right spot but then stops so it is not on so you can sleep if it is in the bedroom.  This is especially helpful since it is easy to place it incorrectly.  It also flashes to let you know the phone is incorrectly placed if it is incorrectly placed for a long  period of time.  Thus I rate it high for helpful user feedback.,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0

Also, the green light comes on and off throughout the night like the connection is bad. I left it on the charger all night last night and woke up this morning to only a half full battery.

For the price this items is good.. I haven’t had it for long so I don’t know how long it will last but so far pretty good. It’s super lightweight and not bulky. It comes with the different type cords. I think the only thing I didn’t like was that if you have one of those magnets pieces on the back of your phone that hooks up to your car holder it does get super hot while charging. And when I tried to do it face down and charge the phone it doesn’t work... or at least it was hard to move the phone and have it charged the phone facing down on the charger. Other then that the charger would of been perfect. I just don’t like having to take my case off every time to charge.,4,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0

"I have had this charger for a little over a year, but after about 10 months or so, I began to notice that sometimes it would just stop charging.  And the rubber on the surface began to warp.  The warping doesn't bother me as much as the inconsistent charging, as sometimes I will check to see that it is charging when I place it on & then it inexplicably stops charging later.  It's inconvenient as I think it's charging & find out later it didn't charge at all.  The inconsistencies have become worse over time.It's a great price, but maybe it's a ""you get what you pay for"" situation!",3,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"This works well. I put my phone on it overnight and it's always charged when I wake up the next day. One downfall is if you're half asleep and think you have put it on the charging pad, but missed the perfect alignment and wake up to a dead phone - that's more user error though.I have had this plugged in next to my bed for about three months. The charging cube it was plugged into,  an Apple one that came with my iPhone, stopped working one day. I've never had an Apple usb cube die like that before.

It has rubber grips to keep it in place and to keep your phone from sliding around. It also charges through my case. This is perfect for and iPhone 8/X/Etc user and it’s price is incredibly worth it.

I slipped it out of its case to put it on the charger back side down and it charged very quickly. But it’s not practical to take it out of the case every time I want to charge it, and I like having some sort of grip on the back, so a conundrum...

"Pros and cons to this charger.  It's quick to charge and convenient to lay your phone on without having to plug in but this is the second one I had to buy because the micro USB-B connection is weak and if you have to unplug it, for example to charge a non-wireless charging device, it will loosen the connection and later, after unplugging and plugging back in, your charger may stop working...as mine did.

I love the fact that it’s micro USB so I don’t have to waste my lighting cord by being plugged in this. Also, the fact that it can fast charge it awesome too. Only thing I don’t like is that you have to get your phone relatively centered on the pad or it won’t charge, but that may also just be the small receiving coil in my phone. ( you get used to getting it centered very quick, not a big deal at all. Also, other products are no better)Ps love the LED that lights up for a few seconds when it starts to charge something.

"This thing charges at the slowest possible speed. I originally had this by my bedside. At first, I didn't think much about the slow charging, since it would reach 100% by the time I woke up. The more I went about my day, I realized how much this wireless charger sucked. Sometimes, I have only a half hour break or so at home before my next errand, meeting, etc. Factor in the natural loss of battery life our devices lose after months/years of ownership makes this thing useless. The final straw for me was that I thought I could have this at the office. I had force closed all of my apps, screen off, bluetooth and wifi off, only streaming pandora or apple music in the background at 35-45% volume. While ON the charger, I was losing battery. It is completely useless. A garbage product. I don't know if any of the other wireless chargers are better, but they must be.

I found the charger CANNOT charge through this piece of metal.  I simply had to move the piece to the top or bottom of the phone case and the charger works fine now.  I found my phone has to be centered on the charger to work correctly.  Overall, I like the product and it seems like it is durable and should travel well.

"Overall this is a decent charger for the money. I have had no problems fully charging my iPhone SE overnight. From my use it appears to charge about 30% in an hour, but your mileage will probably vary depending on your device's battery health. The cable is a little short, about 3 feet, but that's pretty standard nowadays. The green light is nice and bright, and turns on whenever a device is placed onto it. If a non-compatible device is on it, the light will flash. I might hope that when a device is fully charged the pad lights up, but that's not a feature. Not that it's that big a deal but something i think would've been a nice addition. In general, I recommend this charger for light-moderate use.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0

Not having to deal with a long ugly cable on my nightstand and replacing that will a cleaner looking charging pad is something I'll never be able to live without again.  I really like the green light popping on to tell me it's working, and then it turns off after a few seconds.  It's perfectly understated and at an amazingly low price point.  Buy it.

"I’ve had my iPhone for a while now and I’ve never thought about getting one of these Qi chargers because plugging my phone in is too easy and it’s just another thing I need. That said, though I’m not sure how well this Qi charger compares to the competition, I like it a lot. It’s really convenient to be able to pick up my phone to use it, then set it back down to charge it up. It’s especially helpful with these new iPhones because like most of you are aware, apple got rid of the headphone port and while that’s not necessarily a negative, I don’t really feel like paying a ton of money for a set of air pods so using the headphone adapter to listen to podcasts and audiobooks at night is really nice. Now, I can also charge my phone while doing that so I don’t have to worry about falling asleep, waking up, and finding my phone, that was supposed to wake me up, dead because I forgot to plug it in. It all sounds like 3rd world problems but honestly it’s the small conveniences in life that make things so much sweeter, this charger is no different. For the price, I’d recommend it, especially since if you get the adapter, you can turn this Qi charger into a 7.5w or 10w charger too which is pretty cool.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,1,0

"I haven’t done any kind of technical test on the power output but it seems to charge my iPhone 11 Pro about as fast as the fast charger that came with the phone, maybe more like 70-80% as fast.  Easy to set up and use. The green light around the edge is extremely bright in a dark bedroom but it only kicks on for about 5 seconds when you set the phone on the charger. Still, if you check your phone in the middle of the night and set it back on it’s charger, it will be super bright for a short time.  I wish there was a way to dim or turn off that status light.",4,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0

My spouse has an easier time finding the correct placement for her iPhone X to charge but I have to roam with my Google pixel 3 to begin charging. I've had one instance when charging, my phone stopped charging but the saving grace for this product is the LED that illuminates when charging.Personally, I don't use this product for overnight charging but instead leave it in common areas for casual charging where I can keep an eye on it.",3,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I was having difficulty with my plug-in charger and thought I’d look for something different, so I why not the wirelessly charger. I was surprisingly satisfied at how well this has worked to charge my cell, however, I did think it would charge a little faster.  It’s very easy to use...just place your cell on the unit which activates the charge light, so you will know it’s charging.  I have had to unplug the unit a couple of times because after placing my cell it continues to flash and it’s not charging. Once I’ve unplugged the unit it does reset. I’m not sure why that occurs especially since I’ve only had this for two weeks. Otherwise, it works okay.",4,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0

"This is a great little charger for your iPhone if it has the wireless charger feature.  I must confess when I first tried it, I thought it didn't work.  The problem was that I had a metal plate taped to the back of the phone for magnetic attachment to my car's dash for navigation purposes. I removed that and it worked fine.  A flashing light means there's a problem. A steady light for a few seconds means it's charging (and your phone should show that).  Then it's unlighted until it reaches 100% when the light comes back on for a few seconds.  Nifty.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

I was a bit skeptical, since many reviewers said their iphones got really hot due to the Yootech wireless charger, but gave mine to my mom, who recently bought iphone xr.  To my surprise, it worked fine.  (I used 3.0 Anker 18W usb walll charger.)I bought 3rd Yootech wireless charger.  However, this time, both the charger and my phone got really hot. I tried several times to make sure, but every time, they both got really hot.  I emailed the company and after correspondence, they sent me an another one.  I was satisfied with their service.  The new one is working fine so far.  Perhaps last one was faulty product?",5,1,2019-3-28,1,1,0
"This product is amazing! Three days  ago I found out that I was no longer able to charge my phone (note 5) with the plug due to a few of the prons being bent up UGH!! WHO CAN LIVE WITHOUT A CELLPHONE THIS DAY AND AGE?? NOT THIS GIRL! So at that time I bought an $89 charger since my phone was completely without any charge. The charger I bought was ok, but it was a hassle because I had to take my phone out of th case to charge and I had to make sure it was on there just right, I have no patients or time for that plus I needed more than just one charging station and I didn't want to pay $89 again so I  immediately went to my go to AMAZON, and started looking for wireless chargers. That is when I found Yootech wireless charger. It came within a day! I opened it and it looked just like the description said I decided to try it with my case on just to see and I immediately was  estatic because it was charging my phone with the case on it, it also charges much faster than my $89 one , so guess what???? I bought 3 more which are already on the way 😉.

"This being my first Wireless charger it performs just the way I hoped it would. I have to place my phone in the right spot for it find the connection. It rapid charges and stops at 100%. I have left my phone on it overnight with no issues but I do remove my phone as soon as I can just in case (I do the same with cabers too). I do leave my phone case on (which has 3 magnetic strips) when charging. This case has been tested and proved for wireless charging by the company, so no issues there. I have notice my phone gets a little warm after being on the wireless charge but nothing to concern me of overheating. Overall I am extremely please with the use and quality I have been getting, even more so that I let my parents use it to test their phones and they have purchased two for themselves. It does not come with a power supply, just the usb cable but most who buy this will already have the power supply necessary, I use my apple power supply on mine. I have the iPhone X and my parents have the XS. I highly recommend this product because of it's price ease of use.",5,1,2019-1-19,1,1,0

All USB adapters used were Apple brand. Their product support didn't reply to their product support email address provided with the charger.

"An amazing idea and could be fantastic, but there are many flaws. It takes a long time to charge a phone. it's convenient is you leave it next to your bed at night or something, but isn't great to just leave for a bit to charge up. Occasionally, it doesn't recognize that a phone is on it and I have to unplug it and plug it in again to get it to work.Update: constantly having issues with it not functioning, I decided to buy a new cable to replace the one it came with.

As stated by other’s and the company, it’s not as fast as with a direct cord but it’s a great alternative especially if you’re having any port issues or if you just want a cheap and reliable charger around. It worked right out of the box and I’ve had it for over a month. It does not work on any of my IPad models however, just my IPhone 8+. I use it downstairs as an intermittent charger throughout the day when my phone runs low or for guests who come over and stay and to use if their phone has the capability.I was disappointed that neither of my IPads nor my children’s phone’s were able to be charged with the device as that would have made it an invaluable resource at my house & I would have purchased another.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0

This is so easy to use. I have an older Nexus 7 that the charging port is giving problems on. I was told it was Qi capable so I ordered this charger. It was as easy as plugging in the charger using the supplied cable to my wall USB plug and setting the tablet on it in the right spot.

"I’ve always been skeptical when it comes to wireless chargers but after reading the reviews and after seeing the competitive pricing on this one I decided not to pass it up. It was one of the best decisions I made. I LOVE my wireless charger!! It works great, I’ve had it for a few months now and still the same great charge. It’s easy to use and I love that I don’t have to keep plugging in my charger ever night or remember it’s plugged in when someone calls and rip it off the charger on accident. It’s very convenient.

"This charges even though I have a thick case. It’s thin, and light weight if I want to take it on the go (although the reason I bought this was so that I didn’t have to keep moving my cord from home to travel bag). So it stays sitting on my nightstand. I like how the green rig lights up to tell you it’s on and then turns back off so it’s not shining in your face when sleeping. It doesn’t charge quite as fast as my cord, but it’s close in time. I usually buy expensive cords that charge at 5V 2.1A, (higher amps lower volts is a safer way to quick charge). I just thought I’d give a less expensive wireless charger a try since it got such good reviews, to see if they were true. I’m quite surprised how well it works for such a low price, well done manufacturer, and well done to this retailer for picking up this product for your customers. I’m going to get another for my desk.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0

Love it thou if you like looking at the phone or use it while charging that can only happen if it’s on speaker. All in all it’s wonderful. You do have to make sure it’s centered correctly.

Although the use of a completely different phone is a work in progress, this charger has been a godsend! The one thing that was plugged in and had absolutely no problems whatsoever.

Shortly after I got this charger, I mistook it for a coaster and set a beer can on it. It blinked green and I was afraid that I might have damaged it or maybe it was trying to charge my beer. After some experimentation I've found that a can set on top of it will cause it to blink 3 times quickly, while my phone makes it give a single blink that fades in and out. (The user manual says nothing about this behavior.) I suppose this means that the foreign object detection works. Don't be afraid to use it as a coaster in a pinch.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"I love this charger! I'd been using it for some time now, and it works flawlessly with my Samsung Galaxy S10. It's convenient, incredibly easy to set up, and it works just fine with the official Samsung power adapter that came with my phone. It's also unobtrusive during sleep: At night the LED only stays on for a few seconds before turning off, just like it says. No need to worry about sudden disco lights in the middle of the night!As for the charge rate, I feel it's pretty fast given the price point. It took about 2.5 to 3 hours for it to charge from 8% to 100%, and that's when I closed all recently used apps, and left the phone on with the screen turned off. Your mileage may vary depending on how many apps you have running in the background.

The fast wireless charger straight from Samsung costs about $60 so the price of this Yootech one is definitely worth trying. It came with a USB A to USB C cable and USB C to USB C. It does not come with the fast charging wall brick, you will have to supply that yourself. I'm using the fast charging brick that came with my S10e and it does in fact wirelessly fast charge.

Now with a normal power adapter don’t expect it to charge too fast. It will charge but very slow. if you buy the recommend 2.0/3.0 adapter it will charge a lot faster. She loves it I’m happy I don’t have to buy wires so it’s a win win. I did a short test with it and got 8% charge in 15 mins with my otterbox case on. Results may vary.,4,1,2019-1-15,1,1,1

"For the first 2 days this charger worked great. On day 3 it just flashes and doesn’t charge anything, tried different base & phones.  Very disappointed in this charger, won’t be buying this brand again",1,1,2020-6-18,1,2,0
Does what it’s supposed to and works well. The point is that it makes charging your phone at the end of a long night a whole lot easier by just being able to place it down on the charger instead of searching the floor for the cord. It chargers my phone and holds the charge for a long time but this may be because my phone is brand new. Either way definitely worth the money for the convenience and will free up an Apple lighting cord so you can charge up the old way somewhere else in your house.,5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I bought this because the item promised to charge AirPods. It does not do that. Also (like is mentioned in the product description) you CANNOT charge you phone while in any case. This charger is so sensitive it’s not even worth it. Use a regular cord charger instead. Plus this still has to be attached to a cord and plugged into the wall, just not plugged into your device...in my opinion that’s not truly even the definition of wireless. It’s a cheap Chinese knockoff. Just don’t buy it.",2,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I loved being able to charge my phone without actually plugging it in. However, there were aspects of it that I didn’t like. First your phone has to be set on the charger JUST right, or it doesn’t charge which is very annoying.  The other piece to that is your phone has to be turned on before it started charging. Other than that it was a great charger.We have had ours for 38 days now and yesterday it stopped charging randomly- which has been very disappointing. Especially since we were given 30 days to return.",2,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"This is charging my phone with the commuter otterbox, was not sure if it would work,  It did!!!! my phone is the iphone11 and upon doing my phone I was explaining to my husband how the iPhone store they are around 50 dlrs etc. well he said can it charge my phone and his is an android (a few years old) and it did  that was a surprise.

"This charger is awesome! I got it for my Fiancé for his iPhone 8 max but not we both fight over it for our iPhone X max’s. I plan on order more so we don’t have to fight over it. It’s perfect for nightstands and overnight charging, plus I love having one in my kitchen because I like to look up recipes and it’s awesome to be able to pick the phone up to look at next steps and then I can just put it back down on the charger which is amazing for when one hand is covered in ingredients. As long as I have one clean hand it’s all I need to keep my phone charging and ready for use. Would highly recommend and will purchase more.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"This has earned a permanent spot at the office — right on my desk! Love the sleek & compact design, the way it lights up LED green to show phone is charging. Prehistoric are days of messing with tangled chords & cables underneath! This wireless charging pad is truly “plug & play” & it plays real nice! It charged my iPhone X without  a hiccup! At first I thought Yoo~who? Meaning I was not at all familiar with the brand or the company but after reading reviews and the product features, I did a “save for later” on the Anker version as a just-in-case this doesn't work. Well, it’s definitely working so I’ll kindly delete the Anker option. And THAT is saying a lot! It’s my be favorite iPhone must have.",5,1,2018-8-6,1,2,0
"I ordered this because the kids are always coming over asking if they can charge their phones and somehow my cords disappear.  I am putting this on the front entry table - its' low profile - and when they want to charge up, they can.  I tested my phone on it, not knowing it would work because I have one of those gorilla proof 1/4 inch rubber cases on it and it still charges just fine.  It seems we have too many chargers around in our bedrooms, but this one will come in handy for the kids and any guests in the main area of the house, instead of having to go into the bedroom or my office to grab a plug and a USB for them to charge.  Plus some of them have Androids and some have iPhones and its non-discriminatory .  Apple Watch not so much, because the band keeps the face from sitting flat on the surface.  So unless you want to take your band off, you're out of luck there.  But in a pinch, it'll work for anything. Works great for my wireless EarPods, and I love that. I don't know about speed yet because I haven't tested it yet.  But it works!",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"I bought one on a whim to make my office life easier -- I have a lot of tasks across our building, so I'm in and out a lot. Plugging and unplugging just to make it through a long day was driving me nuts, so I ordered one of these on a lark.It's so convenient that I bought another for home! I know that this is a first-world problem, but it was so annoying being curled up in bed reading a book in my Kindle app, then having to roll over and reach around to find the cable, pull it up to feel the tip, stab at my phone in the dark until it clicked... now I just reach over to my nightstand, set the phone on the rubber ring, and scoot it until the gentle light comes on. So easy!",5,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0
"Great charger. It doesn't charge as fast as when I plug directly into my phone (Samsung S10+) but it still has decent charging speed and the convenience of just setting it down to go is great. It will definitely save on my charging port, since I tend to wear that out before the phone itself is worn out. You do need to charge with the phone face up and also remove the socket of the PopSocket, which I figured. So no problems there. The light does turn off when it is charging correctly which is nice. It will blink green when it detects the phone on the pad, but charging is disabled due to various reasons (e.g. phone face down). Also, if using your own wall charger, be sure it is a Fast Charge compatible charger....this will help bump up the charging rate. It will still operate with older model wall chargers, just will be more at a trickle rate.Great deal! Fraction of the price as the Samsung Wireless charger! Fast Shipping! We are happy with our purchase.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"We bought the flat charger and are overall pleased with it. On a few occasions, I haven’t gotten the phone on the correct spot to charge or bumped it and it moved off the correct charging spot...and my phone obviously didn’t charge. It is user error, but it’s annoying nonetheless. We also bought the upright ones (3 of those) and absolutely  love them as the phone is always in the correct place when you set it on the charger. I’d like to trade the flat for an upright one and pay any difference in cost...Get the upright one...you’ll be glad you did.",4,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"Replaced phone as my charging inlet quit accepting a charge. Learned it happens when plugging it in everyday, can cause this problem. This charger allows you to set your phone on top to easily charge when needed. Great for travel as it is flat and small. Takes up no room. I'll be ordering another for my office as my cell needs to have power. Nothing like dealing with clients looking to buy or sell Real Estate and your power is low.The charger will light up with a subtle green band around the outside diameter of the charger. The light does not stay on. The light is to notify you your phone is now being charged. If when setting your cell on the charger and the light does not come on, just move your phone around to assure it started the charging process. A great system and a cell charging protector.",5,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0

8/25/2019 — I have an IPhone X and this charger for some reason it doesn’t charge the phone complete somewhere in the middle it just stops. During the day I have no issue lifting it and putting in back down but when you wake you’d except your phone to be fully charged but for some reason this doesn’t do that for me.P.S I have plastic case on my phone I will remove it and try again will update review once I do that,5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"Bought this wireless charger in July of last year (2018) and it worked great. However, after only a couple months, it just stopped working.  I contacted the seller and they were great. They shipped a replacement to me right away and things were great again. I’m not entirely sure what the lifespan is on these wireless chargers being that they aren’t very expensive, but the replacement that they provided just stopped working again. It has been about 10 months so this one definitely lasted longer than the first one. But I guess I was hoping to get a year + out of a charger that literally just sits on the counter and charges my device each night. I don’t take it anywhere, move it or anything. I could try contacting the seller again but instead, I just ordered a different brand. Will see if that one is any better. The new one came with notice of an 18 month warranty so it’s already looking better than the Yootech model!",3,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
"I bought this for my nightstand, but was afraid the LED light ring around it was going to be too bright. It's not. As advertised, it turns off after about 6 seconds. The main reason why I bought this is because I wanted a faster Qi charger for my iPhone X and I wanted a better confirmation that when I put my phone down on my night stand in the middle of the night, that it was on correctly and would be charged back to 100% by morning. I love how well this works, and there's no missing this visual cue. It's not too bright, either. The green color matches the battery icon on my screen, too. It's a well made product. I highly recommend.",5,1,2019-4-26,1,0,1
"I love the fact that I can throw my phone down and have it charge overnight.  This is my first foray into wireless charging and I have to say that I won't buy another phone without this feature.  This charger isn't ""Google"" approved and won't fast charge my phone, but it works perfectly for overnight charges and I never have to worry about my phone only having a partial charge.  I love the fact that the indicator light isn't blue, but a pleasant green, and mostly goes away after a short brightness to indicate the phone is charging correctly.",5,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
"I bought this a few weeks ago and love it! It has been a great addition to my bedside as I no longer need to pull my phone around when I wake up or be tangled in bed with a long charging cord. Its very thin and light so I am not afraid of dropping the phone off of it. It charges very nicely through a spigen clear case and I have had no problems with placement as long as it is relatively center. The light is also great as it provides immediate feedback telling me the phone is in the correct spot. This might seem pointless if the phone is on as it will notify you as well, but it has come in very handy when my phone had no battery left. This light also turns off after a few seconds so it doesn't bother me when I sleep.I went traveling for 9 days in a different country not too long ago and brought this along. It came in very handy and was easy to pack. I will definitely look into getting another one of these for my desk or to keep in my travel bag!",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,1
***UPDATED REVIEW***The company reached out to me offering to give me a refund or send me a new device. They were very professional and prompt with sending the replacement product! The device works better than the previous one I recieved. So I will be giving it 4 stars!,4,1,2019-1-9,1,1,0
"So far so good, been using it for some weeks now and its working nice and smooth. Things to look out for is that the charger gets really hot when charging and it might not work for all cases, specially plastic ones, because I have a plastic cover on my S8 and sometimes it smells like burned plastic, just be carefull with that in mind.Still I haven't noticed anything wrong with the charger or my phone so I would say its a very good product for yout money.",5,1,2018-11-1,1,1,0
"As you can see from the photo, I use these regularly for my AirPods Pro. For that purpose, and if that’s what you’re buying this for, it works great. Had no problems in that department. However, as seen in the VIDEO, it doesn’t work for my Apple Watch Series 2. At all. It does this thing where the green ring around it blinks, signifying that it isn’t working. Keep in mind this is the same reaction it has to my iPhone 7, a device that isn’t capable of wireless charging at all. I do use a separate charger for the watch anyway, but it confuses me why one works and the other doesn’t.",4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,1
"I purchased this charger specifically to use in my car.  My kids and I have different model phones with different plug types so this makes it easy for anyone to charge their phone.  I also like it because I don't have to fiddle with the plug while driving.  I just put my phone down on the charger and it stays there.  The charger is small enough to fit in the tray in the center console.  My daughter complains that the passengers can't use their phone while driving, but as the driver, I'm not using my phone anyway.  As a passenger, she can fiddle with the connectors and adapters all she wants.",5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"The best part is just knowing that it is charging.  The green light the surrounds the device is lit once the device is put on to charge to indicate charging.  It stays on for a number of seconds 15-30 (not sure and did not time it) and then goes out. It charges my Galaxy S8 phone with its case on, albeit not at the same rate as the charger that came with it.  It does charge more quickly without the case on. I give it a 5 star rating because this product does not mislead, they state everything in fact up front.",5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
This has been a really nice product! It charges my phone quite well! I have a thin wallet case in my iPhone 8 holding 1-2 cards. It charges just fine through the case. My wife has a bigger wallet case with a flap and she has to open the flap for hers to charge(same iPhone). The charger is pretty quick. The one downfall I see is that my phone has to be in the perfect spot. And sometimes that perfect spot is half an inch up or down. Not sure if that is due to the charger or the phone. I like it’s sleek look and that the light will come on when there is a connection and shut off after a short time period. It doesn’t stay on to bother through the night.,4,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"I bought this to replace my wireless charger, that I use everynight, failed.The directions say that to be sleep concious when the charging completes it will blink the BRIGHT GREEN indicator ring for 16seconds. This indicator ring woke me up multiple nights as it is extremely bright. Also, the power circuit for the indicator made an audible hum each time it went on/off on/off. the 16 seconds is far to long! I would suggest this charging pad is only good if not used in  a bedroom. In which case I'd recommend a Qi mat to charge multiple things in some central location of the house.",2,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
I love having this at my desk at work.  It charges fast.  You have to use your fast charger adapter for it to be fast charging.  It's nice to be able to just set your phone down and not have to plug it in.  Great product I would definitely buy more later for gifts.,4,1,2018-4-22,1,4,0

I like to think I am unbiased, but reader discretion advised.**Update: After some research, I found I wasn't using the optimal outlet adapter for this charger.

"The charger it’s self is nicely designed with LED lighting and a nice compact platform. However, if you do not put your phone directly center it will not charge at all, which can be quite frustrating to wake up in the morning and find that your phone hasn’t been charging for the whole night.When it finally does charge it is a lot slower than using a charger, so I find myself just using my regular charger when I’m in a hurry.",3,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"As title states and probably as other reviews state. Placing either phone on this charger, will start charging. And sub 1 minute of being on it it will disconnect.

Look elsewhere or go with a big name charger.",2,1,2019-4-23,1,1,0
What more can you say it does exactly what it should.  Wanted a second charger for my home office and this works great.  Has a nice light around the side so you can see when it starts to charge (it goes off after a while but I like the initial fact it lights up as it interfaces with your phone).Also really like that it has a kind of rubberized ring on the top as it hold the phone in place nicely.  Really love this little guy.,5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I bought this charger specifically for my bedside table.  When I am ""done"" for the night, I just set the phone down on the pad.  A green light shows up letting me know the phone was placed properly and charging has commenced.  It's been a game changer for me.  No longer do I fumble to find the charging cord to insert into the phone OR curse when it falls behind the table.I did ding this as a travel charger.  It's not a huge piece by any means, but it's not necessarily small.  Is it something you can pack?  Yes.  But when space is a premium, I would recommend leaving this charger at home.",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"Love this! I keep it next to my bed and charge my phone on it at night. Charges right through the case. I only have very minor complaints. Sometimes you have to get it on just right before it’ll charge, but the light is a big help to let you know if it’s started charging or not. And it doesn’t charge super fast. It’s great for overnight and when you’re not using your phone. But if you need to charge quickly, you’re better off plugging your phone in.",4,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"Man. This is the best wireless charger we’ve used. We already had two before. We actually tried an Anker one as well at some point, but this one works far better. The grip helps keep the phone on top of the charger. You know it’s in the right spot because of the green light. It charges through both my thin case and my wife’s otter box. We both have iPhone XR’s. The picture shown is hooked up to a ravpower quick charger. It was like $10. The combo of the two helps it charge super quick. I’d buy this wireless charger over and over again.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,1
"The charger disk comes with two charging cables one is a USB-C to USB-C, the second is a USB to USB-C. The cables work very well. I can transfer data using the cables. The charging disk works well and charges fast, however; it will not charge through my wallet style case. I must remove the phone from the case for it to charge. I will not return it. If I need to use the flat disk charger I will just remove my phone from the case, if I need to keep the case on I will just plug in the USB-C cable directly to the phone.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Great charger! Easy set-up and super convenient! Put it on your desk or nightstand and just lay your phone on it to charge. Simple. I use with my iPhone XS that even has a metal tab on the back (for a magnetic mount) and the charger works perfectly. My metal tab is at the top of the case next to the camera and shouldn't be placed in the middle of the iPhone back, as that may interfere with the charging. I have been very happy with this charger and would definitely buy again if I need in additional locations.",5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
Update: The seller reached out to me and I was pleasantly surprised they were going to send me the updated model based on my previous two star review. I didn’t hate it enough it enough to send the product back so I was happy that someone took notice of my review. The newer model is faster than the one I had purchased. It takes about 45 mins for a full charge on my iPhone 8S. It’s a different design in which it does not lay flat. I prefer the flat design more but it does charge faster so no complaints. Five star for the excellent customer service.This charging dock takes a while to fully charge an iPhone. Although it does seem to work for all models it does not beat my normal iPhone charger and plug. It’s nice just to have if you aren’t in a hurry and as an alternative. Also good if you have friends who own other types of mobile devices.,5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"For the price, this charger is quite good. It’s the perfect size so that you always charge your phone in the first try. There’s no sliding your phone around to get it into the right spot.The confirmation light is also pretty great so that you know for certain it’s charging. My favorite thing about this though is that the light turns off after a little bit. As a light sleeper, I’m always trying to minimize the lights in my room. With this, that’s no longer an issue.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
We've owned a few wireless chargers in the house and this one is a fantastic new option.  Nothing is worse than waking up only to realize your phone hasn't been charging at night and a few other wireless chargers we've had don't notify you the phone is charging so you have to pay attention to your phone's screen to make sure.  This one has a large green light that emits when it starts to charge but then soon the light turns off so it doesn't light up your dark room at night.  Fantastic price as well we're going to order a few more just to have around the house/office,5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

Apple refused to fix the port putting me in a position to have to buy a new effing phone.  I am hoping this will extend the life of the bleeping phone.  It even charges through the safesleeve I use to reduce the EMF.  HOWEVER,  I DO wonder how much emf the magnetic field is generating when in use.  no one seems to know, no one seems to care.

I know some of the reviewers love it that the light only light up briefly when you put your phone on to charge so that they can sleep at night.  But since I keep it in my office when charging, I do hope that the light could be kept on when it is charging though so that I know when my phone is done charging.  Another thing is that it came with only the USB charging end.  I needed to use my own adapter to keep it plugged into the wall socket.  Other than these, this is a great item.

I didn't want to spend a lot on a wireless charger if it didn't work and this one fit the bill.  It glows green for a few seconds to confirm you are charging and charges pretty quickly.

This is the second charger of this brand that I've purchased in the last couple of months. I wanted to avoid the constant plugging and unplugging of the charging cable so this was perfect. I have the two chargers at two different locations in my house - that way I don't have to use a wired charger regardless of where I am.They say it's a bit slower but I can't really notice a difference (I'm not usually in a rush). The second charger came with 2 different cables (standard USB to USB-A and USB-A to USB-A).,5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,1
"If you’re using it right, what’s not to love? You set your phone down and it magically charges? It’s less finicky than the first generation Plesson puck I originally owned. As for speed of charge, it’s hard to say. Since it doesn’t come with an AC adapter, I have to assume that I bought the right one alongside this to “faster charge” my iPhone XS. It’s not blazing fast, like USB C to Lightning, but for sitting at my desk during the day, it more than gets the job done. I’d give it five stars if it came with the QC adapter, but can’t argue with the dirt-cheap price.",4,1,2018-12-24,1,0,0

"First, not a huge deal but we couldn’t use this with our cases on our iPhones so we had to take them off everytime we wanted to charge because they heated up impressively fast. I would have returned this particular model, however, it’s past the return window, because my iPhone XR gets (uncomfortably) VERY VERY HOT when using it. We bought the same item from another brand and it did not get hot at all. So we only use this one on a very rare occasion and try to avoid using it entirely for our phones sake. It does charge the phone(not really fast) but it doesn’t let it die when playing music via aux-lightning port in the car but just maintains %. We do like that we can charge and play road music at the same time but it heats up in any case being used or left to charge.",1,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"I was skeptical of wireless chargers in general before buying this product. I figured that if my phone wasn’t in one specific position that the wireless charger wouldn’t work, so I hesitated in buying it. It was only when I was ordering things for college that I decided to give it a shot, and I’m incredibly glad I did.For one, it’s great to use when I’m listening to music with headphones, since I have a iPhone XR, and therefore cannot regularly charge and listen at the same time. When studying at the library, this is a game-changer.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"UPDATEThis product still had issues but after posting this review the company reached out to me and asked if I would like a new version of the product as a replacement, since this one didn't meet my expectations.

Even if this particular item may have been defective it is great to see a small company care enough about their customers to make things right.",5,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0

This is a really nice charger. I have been using it for a couple of months now and it charges pretty fast. I love that the light goes away after a few seconds so it indicates its charging but without annoying me when going to bed. The only complaint I would have is that the microusb wire is a little small. It is the same length as a normal phone charger (3ft ish) but I needed a longer one. I bought another one from Amazon but all in all no real complaints about the charger.,5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"I purchased this product and been using it for quite a while. The product works excellent. But with time my unit developed a defect.  The 3 stars are because it works as described, but 2 months ago, I began to hear a very high pitch low tone in the room, I was not sure where it was coming from.  I just found out two days ago this noise was coming all along from this wireless charger when the phone is not on top of the charging unit.",3,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"Functional - a really nice charger! I have a Pixel 3 and it works fantastically for charging. I have two minor complaints which I did not think about when I purchased this item. The first is very small, I am not a fan of the logo and will either try to cover it up or remove it in some way. The second is slightly more significant, and that is that it can be difficult to figure out exactly what position the phone has to be in in order for it to start charging. If you wake up in the middle of the night and check your phone and wanted to resume charging, sometimes you have to play with the positioning on the charger until it starts to work. Otherwise, this is a great device, I might use it somewhere not next to my bed.",4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Of course I find myself two days past return by date. This just doesn’t work for iphones. Works for a few seconds to couple minutes and then stops working.

Also, do not get that “accessory not supported” message, same story with different phones, and removing phone covers did not help.",1,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
Looks really nice for the inexpensive price but the fast charging is very limited to the device being off. If you use HDMI for samsung galaxy S10 like me who got steam working on my galaxy s10 the phone will not charge very well.Tested example it charges dead to full while off in about 2 hours but while playing warframe on steam max graphics the charger would make my galaxy s10 incredibly hot,4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"I’m still in awe that you don’t have to plug in your phone to charge it anymore! So much less hassle before bed, having to dig for the wire, having it fall off the bed, etc. My only issue with this charger is that you do have to make sure you move your phone around on it until it’s the right spot for the charge. It will glow green when connected and goes away after a few seconds (so won’t keep you up at night!). Purchased two for my fiancé and I and we’re both happy with them.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
This is a great charger! It works relatively fast. It works with a thicker case around my phone. I have an iPhone XS Max and it generally fully charges within an hour on this plugged into a normal usb wall outlet. The green light feature is super helpful and lets you know your phone is connected and charging.

It's great for traveling and takes up even less space than my outlet charger.

It’s super easy to use but if the phone slides off from it then you aren’t charging. I have to try this with a different type of case. It may be the case I have that makes my phone slide off.

"One of the biggest drawbacks of charging via micro USB is the durability of the cords. I'm disapointed that I didn't realize this required your own, standard micro USB cord and wall charger... It can't cost that much more to just include it in the purchase and make it hard wired into the charging pad. Even with high quality USB cords, move this charger much at all and it will stop charging as the USB cord fails.",3,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
I loved this at first but now six months later I'm not a fan. With my mom's phone is takes no time to charge (Samsung 7) with mine (Samsung 10e) the time it takes to charge compared to a cord is doubled.

It's does charge fast, so that isn't a real issue, but something to be aware of.",4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
I purchased this charger because I was tired of replacing broken charging cables. This product does indeed charge my cellphone without needing the delicate cable but it is a low power charger which makes for long charging periods. It also makes the placement of the phone on the unit very important as you try to find the “sweet spot”.

It’s not magnetized or anything & I’ve knocked my phone off the charger quite a few times during the night (pillow falls, turning off an alarm, grabbing something off the nightstand), so be sure to place it where that won’t happen.",5,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0

The light remains on for about 15 seconds, then goes out to not bother your sleep.  I haven't run any tests, but it seems to be a fairly fast charger.

"I love the technology and the price for this. It has an amazing ring of light to tell you specifically if the phone started charging or not. One thing I would improve is a smaller light to indicate the phone is still charging. The charging power is not as powerful as I thought, but it might be due to the adapter. I used the Samsung fast charging adapter and saw no difference in charge speed. But, it is still a very good wireless charger, and I believe it would be better on an iPhone than a Samsung. The grip material to hold the phone in place is also very good, although the charger got so hot the glue melted on the bottom grip and caused it to detach. I tried several times to push it back in but it could easily be rubbed out of place again. Eventually I just took it out for good. The port to plug USB-C in was also a little loose but I've seen no issue at all so far. All in all this is a very good charger for the price.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0

Decided to buy my husband this wireless charger instead of him having to deal with plugging in his phone every night. This is a GREAT wireless charger especially for the price. His only complaint is that once your phone is fully charged it will stop charging (which is great for long term battery life on the phone) so you will wake up with only 80-90%.

"At first, I loved this. I used it every night on my S8. It was so cool, since I had never had a charger like this before! Unfortunately, it stopped working after a few months. I was so disappointed. It charged so well before that and suddenly I woke up to my phone not being charged and the charger flashing green telling me it can't charge my phone. I suppose I had this coming since it was so cheap. I think if you're going to pay for a wireless charger then you should put some extra money into it.",2,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
This product works so well and is so easy that I want to get another to keep downstairs.  Comes in handy next to the bed if your using it for am alarm clock. It will light up green for bit and then will shut off but is still charging. Reason for 4 stars is it did not come with a long enough cord and no adapter.,4,1,2018-7-26,1,2,0
"I bought this over a year ago and it's been great until last night.  Every night I turn off my phone & charge it; it's fully charged by morning.  However today, when I turned the phone on, it was only on 9%; quickly dropping down to 3% where it has stayed while on the charger.  Also, the charger itself feels very warm; almost hot.  I don't know the lifespan on these charges; maybe I need a new one?!Wondering if anyone else had this issue.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0

"This is very simple to set up and easy to use, but it charges SO SLOW. Literally plugging my phone in with a normal lightning cable can have it charged in under 2 hours.

"I bought this charger and it worked well for about a month. I started to notice after that month, I would pull my phone off this charger and it would be at less than 20% battery some times. I thought at first that I was knocking it off the charger in my sleep but it became more and more frequent. Finally, I got tired of my phone not being charged and I watched my phone as I set it on the charger, the green light would light up like it was charging, then after the green light would shut off, so would the charger. I immediately ordered a different charger and threw this piece of crap away. Not even worth the postage to send it back to Amazon.",1,1,2019-9-13,1,1,0
"Buyer beware. My husband loves his but has to take his phone out of its case for it to work.

"It works great. I bought it for my galaxy buds since it utilizes wireless charging and it works for that no problem, but I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to charge my phone on it too with ease. My phone has a relatively thick case and sometimes these wireless chargers won't be strong enough to go through it but this charger really makes it easy. Just plop it down, it doesnt even have to be perfectly centered and it will charge. If you have a fast charging adapter (this product does not include one) it does indeed have really fast charging. I also like the green light that comes up to indicate that it is charging. The light goes away after a while so it's not bothersome too. All in all a great product and highly recommended.",5,1,2019-3-30,1,0,0
What can I say other than must buy. It gets a little tricky finding the right spot to charge my phone because I have the bigger Iphone but besides that it works great. Wireless charging is not meant for quick charging your phone so I already knew that. If I am in the house and cooking or watching TV I comfortably just leave my phone on the charging mat for few minutes or hours. That is what I love the most. I don't have to look for cords when I am just laying around the house. Set my phone down and go. It has never malfunctioned for me so far. Love it. Great buy,5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
First time using wireless charger and loving it.  So easy and quick; much better than plugging/unplugging cable.  Actually this might save money in the long run; less wear and tear on lightning cable.  The phone does get warm but never gets hot.  For iPhone 11 you'll need to buy at 5v/2a AC adapter.,5,1,2019-9-20,1,1,0
I was skeptical about buying this product but thought I would try it out anyway because my son has one and he loves his.  Basically just wanted a simple one for traveling. So much to my surprise when I bought this product it works well and my phone doesn’t heat up leaving it on the charger with the case on it. My Samsung wireless charger was heating up my phone while charging. So I just use this charger and it does a great job. I have had this charger for 4 months now and still does a great job charging and not heating the phone up while on charging pad.,5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
"Great Qi wireless charger and the price and quality can’t be beat. We have already purchased 2 of them after using the first one for a few weeks and it works so well we wanted to add another one to our kitchen and living room area to charge on. I plan to probably pick up another 2 of them just to add to bedrooms also since we are all using iPhone 8’s now as it makes it super convenient to lay phone on the charger and it seems to charge up pretty fast.Overall, seems like a great product and I hope it will last us a good long time.

"Just that simple, it works. I've bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself.  It's iffy at working with a case on the phone. My wife has a new iPhone and has no issues, whereas I have to take my Samsung Galaxy out of it's case at night to get it to charge, but that's not a problem to save the amount of money I did buying these compared to what the phone manufacturers want for theirs. Now if it lasts a couple of years without catching on fire or anything,  I'll really be happy!",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"This product sucks. It works sometimes but then just stops charging for some reason. For example, I’ll set my phone down for the night and, in the morning, I’ll see my phone is only half charged because the charger stopped working. No idea why. I have to unplug the charger from the wall, wait a while, then plug it back if for it to start working again. I wish there was something better.",2,1,2020-4-11,1,1,0
I use this product for my iPhone 8. I also tried it on a Samsung s9. It has a green light that comes on when you set your phone on the disc that indicates it is charging your phone and then the light will fade out which is nice if you use the changer at night. It is very simple to use and works with my both phones in there cases(no need to remove a phone case - my case is a thick life proof). I love not having to plug my phone in at night. Heat wise the phone will be warm but not any more than with typical use ( this is mostly when I am charging my phone and streaming from it at the same time). No melting of cases or crazy heat. Great product for the price. There is no delay in delivery I ordered it right before Christmas and came in by predicted date. Over all I’m a very pleased.,5,1,2019-1-10,1,1,0

Great for my girlfriends iPhone X. We share a nightstand when she is over and she was always using my charger cable so i bought this to keep on the nightstand for overnight charging. It works perfectly and is very convenient. Only thing to keep ion mind is that it does not come with it's own charging brick so you'll need to have one to plug into.,4,1,2018-5-7,1,2,0
"I purchased this charger along with a QI receiver for my iPhone 7. The charger is pretty straightforward, you plug it in and place your phone face up on the charging pad. I use mine next to my bed to charge overnight. The green light comes on for about 5-10 seconds after the charge starts to ensure the phone is charging. I know that if it blinks I don’t have the phone positioned correctly. I am able to charge my phone while in my wallet case, I just make sure there are no magnets/metal between my phone and the pad. The charger is good quality and I hope to upgrade my phone soon so I don’t have to continue to use the QI receiver.",5,1,2018-12-19,1,1,0
My nightstand next to my bed has outlets in the top drawer that I am able to plug this charger into and lay my phone on at night. This also allows me to shut my drawer as it charges. It charges fast enough through out the nights that I need it and I am always ready to go in the mornings.

"Will it charge your phone? Yes. Will it charge it fast? No. This thing takes FOREVER to get a decent charge. From 25% battery, it would take at least 3-4 hours to fully charge. I like charging my phone before bed so I can unplug it before I go to sleep but with this thing, I had to make sure to charge it HOURS before bed so it can have 3/4 battery.

I knocked off an star only because sometimes when putting it on the charger, sometimes it doesn’t charge when it shows it is charging, but other times it does warn me that the charger isn’t charging by the light blinking.

It is easy to carry in my computer bag or small purse as it is flat and lightweight.  I have one on every floor, I have one at my office .

This is a great charger for me to keep on my nightstand. It's not a fast charger like my corded one that came with my phone. But it's nice to not have to deal with the cord when I want to quickly grab my phone and do stuff. I have a pop-socket so that hinders the charging so I have to take my phone case off at night to charge it. When my battery is almost dead this charger takes about 3 hours to charge it back up.

They are also much less costly than options at the Apple store.  A really nice product!",5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"Love, love this charger! It’s a snap to use; I just my iPhone near the charger, and I hear that satisfying chime from the phone that it’s found a power source, the green ring on the charging pad lights up for a few minutes, and then the light goes out...and the charging continues.Will your phone still receive signal while charging? You bet! I was working on my iPad upstairs from where the phone was charging, and the call came in...on my iPad upstairs! The phone took the call on both devices t the same time! So weird talking into my iPad! Oh yeah—I definitely recommend this product!",5,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0
"I originally purchased this weary of whether or not it would work with my phone case on, other chargers I had used with my Otterbox wouldn't work or had issues, this one works flawlessly every time!It's well worth every penny, for the price you might be concerned about the quality, but I honestly don't know how other people get away with selling these things for so much when these guys are able to sell them for so cheap at a much better quality.",5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
"Bought one of these a few months ago for home use. Was skeptical, given the low cost of these compared to the 'premium' brands, but figured what-the-heck let's give it a try.I was pleasantly surprised. Charges my phone quite quickly (though not as fast as a wired QC3.0 quick-charge setup).",5,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
"I am so glad I got this! It is the only charger in my life that stays put! Charging pad seems to work pretty quickly, I generally leave my phone on there for a bit each day. You do have to make sure that your phone is in the right spot to charge, I generally wiggle it around until I see the battery is charging.  Would make a great gift!",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I bought a similar charger months ago at nearly double the price. This performs just as well. If your phone supposrts wireless charging, this is a must. Why spend a single cent on cords that break and become useless in a matter of weeks or don’t fit the protective case you choose?Just as and FYI, I do have a case on my phone and it charges just fine through it. It does not work with a pop-socket.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
I might have gotten a defective charger since it doesn't fast charge my phone. It's also a very slow charger. Takes 3-4 hours to charge my phone fully when just pluging it in directly takes an hour at most.Edit:,1,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
Super convenient. Have had this for several months now and works great with my iPhone. I’ve tested it with and without case on my iPhone 8 and it works. Tested with another iPhone with otter box and worked. Tested with google pixel phone and worked - that phone didn’t have a case so cannot attest to that. Seems pretty legit for working on all phones.,5,1,2018-12-20,1,1,0
I wanted this to charge my phone and my AirPods. It charges the phone fine and the green light goes off after a moment. The AirPods don’t seem to charge and the green light never stops blinking. It’s fine as a phone charger but I really needed both.,3,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
"I like the ease of use of the product & how easy it is to transport....but charging takes forever for me. I don't think this would be a problem if you charge overnight, but since I don't do that, in order to keep the battery life from reducing, it's a big issue for me. I'll keep using it as a desk charger because of how effortless it is to just set the phone on it right next to you while working - but definitely won't be my main or go-to charger.",3,1,2020-8-23,1,1,0
"I have been using this Yootech wireless charger with my Galaxy S8 for a little over a couple months now, it's fantastic and works without any issues. I especially enjoy the fact that the wireless charging works through my phone case; I don't have to take it off to charge the device, fantastic! Quick and clean delivery through Amazon Prime. My S8 charges from 0% all the way to max in 2 hours and 15 mins wirelessly, but the original S8 charging cord plugged into the phone and the wall can fast charge it in 1 hour and 35 mins. It's not that much of a drawback but might be a gripe for some folks out there. It has a very cool and vibrant light, (mine's green!) to show you that the wireless charger recognizes a connection, and stays on for a mere 5 seconds. I don't recall seeing it light up when the phone is fully charged however which would definitely be convenient. I read an article online that said leaving your phone on the charger when it's already fully charged for a certain amount of time can damage the battery life. I would like to see future models of these awesome wireless chargers to implement more usage of the neat light that it has, if of course it hasn't been done already. The price point is also very ideal especially with free shipping with Amazon Prime!",5,1,2019-3-7,1,0,0
"I have a friend that has problems plugging in her cable to charge her phone.  She has no problems using this device to just lay the phone on it and it charges.  I understand that the light goes out for those people who are light sleepers, but I'd like to have the light stay on to indicate that the device was still properly sitting on the charger and charging.  Overall the product and price are a nice combination and I've bought another one for my friend to use in her living room so she can keep her phone charged no matter where she is when she remembers to charge it.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"Works as well as the brand name wireless charger my daughter uses for her phone. And it costs less.Comes with a USB cord for charging. I am very pleased with it. My husband and I have both used it at work and a few co-workers have purchased one they liked it so well. Charges quickly, even with a case on the phone although I usually take my case off to make sure there is no overheating, even though we have yet to have that happen.",5,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
"The product came in very nice packaging, and the charger it’s self is nice and sleek. I was worried about charging through my life proof case but it had no problem doing so at all.

Side note I have an IPhone 8 Plus and have no charging problems",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Does not come with USB Adapter Plug. So if you have a USB built into your outlet you're on Easy Street.  If you don't have a 2.4 amp (or higher) USB adapter/charger you'll need one. The typical (common) USB chargers are only 1 amp, which will not run this pad. Once you figure that out it works like a charm.  I love how I can just lay it on the pad on the table by my chair and charges while I watch tv or computer surf so if someone calls or texts I can just reach over and pick it up without yanking out the charging cord.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"I very much like the convenience, and also adore the fact that it is slow charging so it will extend the life (in years) of the internal battery in my iPhone 8.  The downside is slow charging (but which hugely--more than doubles) the lifetime of your battery when not charged rapidly.  Downside: if you need very fast charging, this will not deliver, but fast charging kills battery life.  If you need fast, urgent charging, this is not the product you want.  But personally, it fits perfectly in my life and I highly recommend it overnight charging.",5,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"Kindof cheap.  Doesn't always charge.  Light decided when it wants to work.

I am satisfied with their responsiveness and willingness to make right by their customers.",5,1,2019-2-8,1,1,0
"I like that this is more unique than the typical charger. It likely charges slightly faster (at least in comparison to factory apple chargers). However, I use a life proof case because I am clumsy. Oopsy! While this charger may be able to charge through the typical phone case, it cannot charge through the LifeProof case, sadly. If anyone out there uses a LifeProof case, you understand how difficult it can be to take it on and off. 😅",4,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"To be honest, I only bought this because I needed to spend a few extra dollars on amazon to get free shipping at the time a wireless charger felt like an unnecessary luxury. However, after having it for two or three months I can't imagine charging any other way. My wife bought two from Wal-Mart for about the same price and neither of them worked. This charger has been quite a pleasant surprise I don't think I will ever go back to charging with a cord. In fact, I don't even know where my chord is.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"I lay my brand new phone on this brand new wireless charger before bed and expect to wake up with a fully charged phone.. I lay my brand new airpod pros on it and expect to wake to a full charge. but in all honesty it just doesn't work! 9 out of ten times I use it,, It just doesn't work! Its completely hit or miss whether this thing is charging or not.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"This thing is great and saves me the hassle of trying to find the charging hole on my phone in the dark. Only complaint would be that you can’t just set your phone on it; it has to aligned exactly right, but you do get a green light that will shine when you get it on right. Sometimes that can take a few moves before success. Overall game changer though",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"The description for this product says the manufacturer provides a lifetime warranty, but this is not the case. The device failed after about 20 months of service. Attempts to contact the seller through Amazon produce never-ending requests for more information about your order -- information you have already provided -- and when you provide it again, they just don't respond to your messages. In short, this device is a rip-off and the customer service is terrible. This is not the induction charger you are looking for. Move along.",1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"The charging pad works great for my airpods, however if you have a phone case over your iphone you will need to take off the case before the charging power works for charging your phone which is kind of a bummer.

There is probably issues with other Macs as well. Other than that this is a great buy. I would have given five stars otherwise but this is a major let down for Mac users.",2,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0

"I’m very happy with this charger, it’s pretty much as straightforward as it gets. I unpacked it, plugged it into a power brick, placed my phone (iPhone XR) on top and it immediately started charging. I haven’t had to mess with phone placement a single time and I haven’t noticed my phone getting hot, just slightly warm. The charger itself is small and clean looking.

"This is a great affordable wireless charger. It’s simple, and has a few minor touches that make it stand out over the charger I used previously. I really like the rubber ring. The micro-usb port has a very sturdy hold (many products in this price range tend to have a loose connection compared to this one). I also like that the light goes off pretty quickly and is bright enough to let me be a little lazy with placement and see if it’s charging. My previous one didn’t have a very bright light when it started charging so it was harder to know that I had the placement right.Hopefully this one lasts longer than my last one from a different company. My other one only lasted maybe 8 months.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0

While it does charge, finding the 'sweet spot' is a pain. My phone (galaxy 7) needs to be facing a specific direction and it needs to be center but not completely center before it kicks in. if you pick up your phone really quick or just bump it, it will stop it from charging until you find the 'sweet spot' again. It's annoying.",3,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"I charge my phone each night without issue on this disc. Just make sure to hit the sweet spot and listen for the ding on your phone to know its charging.

"Over the years, I had to replace so many cords from constantly plugging my phones in and out. The connections would get loose and the phones would not even charge overnight.  You never knew it until you woke up in the morning to a dead phone that was plugged in all night.These pads were installed in our conference rooms at work. (Our IT folks always research and buy the most reliable equipment, so I knew that due diligence was completed). This was a great idea as many of us use our cellphones throughout the day and have to run back and forth from meetings to recharge. I love just placing the phone on the pad...it's that simple.  My wife's chord at the time was no longer working, so I bought one for her and one for me from Amazon. Love these pads. Phones charge quickly.  No fumbling around with cords anymore! Highly recommended. Now I need something like this for my car!",5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
"Doesnt work at all!! I’m so upset that I ended buying it twice. When I saw that the light turns on once you place your phone, I thought it was actually charging, then I put it on my guest room and ordered 2 more for other areas in my house. As I put one in my bedroom to charge my own phone, I saw that it doesnt charge AT ALL. My Iphone X would stay there all night and still show less than 10% battery. I tested the others around the house and same thing. My husband bought him from another brand and it works perfectly. With these, I totally wasted my money.",1,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I purchased this product for the convenience of not having to plug in a cord to charge my phone. I can say this has had the opposite effect. If your phone is not sitting in the perfect position on this charging mat it will not charge. After it lights up saying the phone is charging, double check because sometimes it actually isn't.

And it’s such a small and light little thing, so I can easily take it to my nightstand before bed or to my desk to lay my phone down to charge while I’m on my computer. Super handy. Works immediately out of the box. And it shipped really fast too. I avoided the idea of getting a wireless charger for so long, thinking they were super expensive or something. But nope! Very reasonably priced, and it works great. It’s not the fastest charge, but if you’re laying it down and leaving it be while you’re sleeping or busy with something else, I don’t really see how that’s an issue. Overall, super handy, easy to use, and very small and lightweight.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

I have an Iphone 8 in a Otter Box protective case (farming can be rough on phones).  The Yootech Wireless Charger has worked like a champ for the past month.

"This charger is great for all wireless charging capable phones. If you find that your charging rate is very slow , check the output of the adapter you are using as input for the Yootech. It may be the case that the adapter output is not large enough in Wattage to have a good rate of charge. I switched the adapter I used because the first one was not working and now it chargers quickly. Expect around 2.5 to 3 hours for a 0-100% charge. Most wireless chargers are still being engineered to charge quicker but the technology of this Yootech and other similar chargers are impressive. Also is a good budget charger compared to more expensive brand name ones from Samsung or Apple.",4,1,2019-3-24,1,0,1
I love love this wireless charger—I’ve been using it for a couple months now and I’ve had *no* problems...no overheating no weird buzz and it looks great too!

They are incredibly convenient, but I used a couple that would not charge through a phone case and that just wasn’t happening. The yootech chargers give off a momentary green glow once a connection is established, and do not drop that connection until you move your phone manually. It’s a simple thing, but a lot of other companies don’t seem to be able to make that happen, especially if you have a case on your phone. I will also note that I have a pop socket as well, and you have to detach the top part of the pop socket in order to charge wirelessly. It is a slight inconvenience, but there are no wireless chargers that work with a fully assembled pop socket.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,1

It will work for a little while but then the block just stops working entirely. I'm using it on a surge protector. I have no idea why it keeps killing my charging blocks but i'm going to have to stop using it because now I'm out 2 out of the 3 that I've had on hand for years.  I've never had anything like this happen.  If it takes a specific type of charging block, just send it with the product instead of making us figure it out as it damages our electronics.

This makes wireless charging with the iPhone easy as can be. Brief light up to let you know it's charging then goes dark. The charge is quick. I use it with an LG quick charging wall adapter.

It works as advertised. It’s a rapid charger we use for our iPhone XR’s. The color lights are especially helpful when placing your phone on it in the dark so you know it’s charging. The light will shut off after a minute so it’s not annoying. It’s easier to see than the battery indicator on the phone.

"UPDATED REVIEW: See below for my original review—which was about the actual product and not the seller. Anyway, a few days after posting this review, I got an email from Nikki, a rep of the seller. She apologized and then offered to replace the charger without me having to even return the faulty product (which I have packaged and ready for drop off). I haven't yet received the new charger, but Nikki emailed to say it's been sent. I would say this is excellent and proactive customer service. Pretty rare these days. I would definitely purchase other products from this seller again based on their actions and handling of the situation.ORIGINAL REVIEW: This charger stopped working after I charged my phone one time. I noticed it wasn't working the following morning when my phone had 10% after being on the device all night. I unplugged the charger and plugged it back in and it worked. But this kept happening. I've had the charger for about two weeks and it intermittently worked until yesterday. Now it doesn't work at all. This product sucks. Don't buy it if you want to have reliable charging.",5,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0
"Not sure if I got a defective one, but this product barely works at all. I have an iPhone XS Max and decided to try out the wireless charging ability, so I bought this. I made sure to remove my phone case while using it to get the best results but I woke op with my phone just barely at 30% charged (went to bed with it charged at 1%). I woke up a few times during the night to make sure it was working, but I always had to move it to get it charging again. Will likely be returning.",2,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
Have to your phone in just a certain position to get the charger to connect/charge your phone.  You can’t just lay the phone any which way on the charger and go.  It’s suppose to be cell case friendly but wasn’t friendly to my phone with or without the case.Very frustrating.  Sent mine back after trying it for 2 weeks.,2,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

The charging pad is roughly a 3-1/2 to 4 inch circle.  It does have anti-slip stickers on it. It comes with a standard USB 3 foot charging cable. It works for what I need and seems to have pretty good power. However I was not impressed with the fact that it did not come with a wall-wart.  All that was in the package was the cable and the charging pad. I had to go out and buy a 2 amp adapter.,3,1,2019-5-26,1,0,0
It wouldn't charge my phone unless I took the case off. I just plugged the cord directly into my phone and use the round charger to put my coffee on.,2,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
"The best wireless charger you can find. The price is great, but that's not the best thing about it. It's very slim and compact so it looks really cool on my nightstand, but it also performs really well. When I put my iPhone on it, it immediatley begins to charge. I know this because the charger has a cool green light up effect when it starts charging. This is an excellent feature, especially since the light turns off after a few seconds. It also charges my iPhone really well and fast. No complaints at all. If you're in the market for a wireless charger, grab this one! You won't be dissapointed!",5,1,2019-1-16,1,0,0
Love this charger! I keep it on a table near my front door and quickly place my phone or airpods on there whenever they need charging. It even works with my iPhone still in the case! And I love that it lights up to let me know the devices are connected.One tip: buy a fast-charge plug to go along with it so your devices charge up super fast!,5,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
I loved this charger at first and then I noticed it became very particular as to how I needed to set it on the plate for it to charge and then finally no matter how I placed it on there it would not charge.  After two months it quit working. I would like to get my money back or have a replacement one sent but I’m out of the refund window.  Too bad.,1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"This is a great tool if you dont really use your phone and have it down most of the time. For me i use my phone frequently except for when im busy at work. The main problem is that it does not charge as fast as i had hoped. it took 30 minutes to charge 10% and i connect the cord to a 61w USB-c power adapter, the same one i use to charger my laptop and my laptop charges to 100% in 45 minutes. i have no background apps running nor did i have a case on my phone. Please leave any suggestions on how i can improve the usability of this product.",3,1,2019-6-16,1,1,0
UPDATE TO PREVIOUS REVIEWUpdated review: After returning the chargers for working intermittently I was contacted by the seller. They were very apologetic and wanted to remedy my problem.  They offered to refund my money and send me two replacement chargers.  Even better is that these chargers were a newer version than what I originally ordered.  I received the chargers within a few days. They are working great and I am very satisfied with the product and even more satisfied with the customer service.,5,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0
"At first I was not sure about this item. On a few occasions it would start charging but then stop charging at some point. I quickly figured out that placement of phone on the charging pad was very important. After a couple nights of charging. I am using an add-on QI receiver, so I had to match up the coil with the charging pad. I figured out that due to the length of my phone (its fairly tall), the top of the coil pad only reached about the mid-point of my phone. The coil itself was only about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom of the phone. So I had to place a considerable portion of my phone above the charging pad. It looks weird at first, like my phone will flip off the pad because so much of it's weight is suspended in air. Now that I am used to the phone placement, it works every time.  The charge seems to be quick, but it does not touch the speed of the OEM plugin quick-charger. Though it is fast enough and you cannot beat the convenience.",5,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0
The charger works great!!  I use the wireless charger  with the newer Samsung charger and also  an  older Samsung charger (with an adapter to the newer c connector). Wireless  is  better for the phone than just plugging in the charger cable (though a little slower). Works as good as the more expensive Samsung unit.,4,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"It’s very slow to charge and makes my phone pretty hot. It makes me question the quality. I guess this would be good if a wired connection wasn’t working, but I’m not impressed with the product.UPDATE : the company has since reached out since my review and offered a refund and a different product to try.  I’m still taking off one star for the initial product, but have added two for the company being willing to make things right.",4,1,2019-1-30,1,0,0
"At this time Apple doesn’t have their own so I ordered this for my IPhone 11 cause it was an Amazon best seller. For like $10 you can’t go wrong. Its a good size for a night stand or office desk. Lights up green for a few seconds to let you know it’s charging. It works, thats always a plus lol. I would definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
While I will say I love the wireless charging. This charger has one big problem. My phone will fall off of it. It literally moves until it stops charging and you wake up with a phone that isn't charged. I don't know what makes the phone move. But I can say it would be easily fixable if they put some better rubber on the top to keep it in place. Overall the charge is good. A little slow but okay because I charge overnight.,3,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
I bought one of these chargers in December 2019.  It worked great until this wee (July 2020) when it just stopped working.  I have a second one I actually bought earlier in 2019 and that one is still working.Great device as long as it works.  I used it with an iPhone XR with a waterproof case and it charged it with the case on.,3,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Got this product to wirelessly charge my new Apple Airpods Pro. I read the description, customer reviews, and Q&A's to make sure it was compatible. I plugged in the charger and placed my airpod on the charger and nothing happened. I tried charging my phone with the case and no charge even though I moved it around. I took the case off my phone and eventually got it to work but you have to get it right in the center. Tried charging airpods again and still doesn't work. Emailed Yootech support and they respond with one email a day. They asked me a whole bunch of questions and wanted a video of it after I already packed it up for return. Not worth anyone's time waiting a whole day for one email response and who knows how long for a replacement. Quite disappointed",1,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
What a great bargain on this really nice wireless charger.  Let’s face it there are lots of options in this space but this one has all the functions of a pricier unit at a fraction the cost.  Not to mention it looks nice.  Charging power is good and fast.  Only improvement would be to make this unit a little heavier to give it a nice overall feel.,5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0

"I bought this charger for my wife's Samsung Note 8. The charger works well and charges the phone quickly.Having the wireless charger by your bed is a lot nicer than having to search for the cable to plug it in.

It does not come with a charger pack but does come with a USB cord. Attach it to your charger with USB and the other end to the pad. I have a Note8 which is 10 watts and it charges incredibly fast. Center your phone on the Pad. The pad and the phone link to start the charging process. I had a problem with the pad flashing, and I got ahold of YOOTECH. They were very courteous and reminded me the phone cant be more than 4mm away from pad. Mine was to far away caused by the protective case. I removed my case and the pad works perfect. They also have a lifetime warranty and replacement. I'm very happy with my Yootech Wireless Charger Qi-Certified 7.5W Wireless Charging Pad.",5,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0

For a summary of what they've been through, I took them out of the box, plugged them in in my office and nightstand respectively, and have left them there for the past month or so.  They successfully charged my phone without issue since, with maybe one or two instances that I attributed to failing to put the phone on the charging pad in the proper location.",2,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
It doesn't charge super fast but I leave it on my nightstand so when I wake up in the AM my phone is charged up and ready for the day.

"I love this.  The only thing I will say, is you have to make sure the phone is placed on it so the green lights goes on when you first put it down.

That's not to say you have to make sure it's in the same position every time, just ""in general"".  Nine times out of ten I just lay it on the charger it's fine.

I was a bit concerned and wasn't quite sure if it would work ok with my cell phone cover, but that was not an issue at all (phew)!  It took me a bit to get used to where to place my phone on the charger, but once I realized it just needs to be centered, all was good.  I really like that the green charging light dims after just a bit - this way the light doesn't bother me.  I'm so sick of the charging port breaking that I will probably get more wireless charges!

My phone charger plug wasn't working so I ordered this for the mean time to use and it works amazing. It charges pretty fast.

This charging pad is thin and fast. I bought it because my wife and I upgraded to the 11 pro max and I thought it was funny that the directions said it would be slow. It actually charges pretty fast compared to our mophie charging pad. There is no need to buy a $40 charger when you can get one a quarter of the price and have your phone charge faster. The photos show that when it starts charging it lights green for a few seconds and then fades. Very convenient if you don’t know whether or not it’s charging.,5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,1
"This thing is pretty sweet. It's definitely light and you can easily feel why it's as inexpensive as it is. But, overall, pretty solid design. Nothing was loose, the charging chord fit tightly into the port, and it performs as expected. That being said, you will not get an effective charge unless you use a 2 AMP USB charging brick. Most charging bricks you find (all of Apple's, most Samsungs, etc) are either 0.5AMP or 1AMP output, I had to use a 2AMP brick to get it to charge my iPhone XR. This is even without a case.

Also this doesn’t work unless you adjust your phone into a perfect spot. Really wish it did work. Would have helped with avoiding all the hassle.",1,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"This charger only works well when the USB cord is attached to an Apple adapter, then it really zooms along and charges the phone in about 20 minutes. If not, it takes up to an hour to charge an iPhone X.",3,1,2018-8-7,1,4,0
"Some of the reviews for this product were not good, however, I wanted to try it and the price was reasonable, so I purchased one.  Since then, I have bought several more; one for work, one for my son and a couple more as gifts.  All seem to work great except after a couple of months we have found that my daughters Iphone X will not charge using this charger.  It worked for several months, then just stopped.  I can still charge my Iphone X on it, however, hers just will not charge anymore.  She has not changed cases, so I'm really not sure what would cause this.",5,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
Simply the best wireless charger I have seen or used.  Great quality and very affordable.  I have bought one for every family member in my house.  I have recommended this wireless changer to all my family and friend.  The wife and I have iPhone XS Mas and our Son has an iPhone XR.  We all have cases on our phones and the all charge well without any problems.  When you place your phone on the charger the base of the charger will light up green for about 5 seconds to notify you it's sitting on the base properly and charging well.  This wireless charger is way better than plugging in the lighting cord.  I would recommend to anyone.,5,1,2019-5-31,1,0,1

"My wife has a charger that holds the phone at an angle.  It’s okay.  I personally like to just place my phone on this flat charger, see the green light come off for a few seconds showing that the phone is charging, and then have a nicely charged phone the next morning.  My wife may want one.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"Works great when it wants to... worked really good when I first got it but it’s been 2 months now and it is having issues charging my phone. If you don’t have your phone in an exact position on it it won’t charge which is super annoying. I do like that the ring lights up to tell you it’s connected but sometimes it will just randomly stop charging. Also, when it did work it charged painstakingly slow. I’ll stick with my regular amazon cheapo lightning cord lol.",2,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
I use this on my night stand. This thing works great and charges without me needing to remove a rather thick case off the phone. Also it has an LED light that indicates the phone is charging as soon as u place the phone on it but the light goes off right away so no bothersome lights at night. It’s also very thin and has a rubberized band on top so the phone doesn’t slide around. For the price u can’t beat it.,5,1,2019-4-3,1,0,0
Its a great charger and even better price. It even charges through my note 9 Otterbox defender case and very few wireless chargers will work with my case.***UPDATE*** this is very slow charger. It takes about 10 hours to fully charge but it charges through my defender case. Its just sooo slow.,2,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"1/2 the time I put it on the charger and made sure it was charging, I’d come back later and it was flashing and did not charge at all!  After 2 times overnight and waking up to an almost dead phone I realized I had to return it.  And I was always careful to make sure it was set in the right place.

"One of the only chargers I’ve found where there is NO light while sleeping.  Lights up for few seconds when you place device down to let you know it’s charging, then light goes out.  It’s been proven that ANY ambient light when you sleep, however small, reduces quality of sleep. Even small led’s from surge protectors, clocks, sleeping devices add up to reduce sleep quality.  Pitch black improves it, once someone gets used to it.  This is scientifically proven, even in those who say it doesn’t affect Them, using testing and functional mri’s.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"I have a similar older Samsung version that I couldn't use with my upgraded phone. Change in technology has made the Samsung one outdated as it doesnt support the Qi wireless charging phones. This one is easy to use out the box. Its actually a bit thinner and lighter than the samsung one. It doesn't light up like the samsung one to visually tell you when your phone is fully charged but its definitely worth the price. Easy grab and go, out the door, without fumbling with a cord. It charges fast enough. Recommend it.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"This little guy is great for my AirPods because of the size, just perfect for them! I don't only use the pad for AirPods though, my iPhone XR is also compatible for this technology. Although the pad is a bit small for the XR, it's still fully functional and charges very fast. The only downside to this product is the cord connecting the pad to a port is a bit too small for where I am putting it now. Also, I'm still wondering why they gave me two cords for one device but still a plus in my mind!Pros:",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,1

However, after numerous attempts and multiple styles of phones, removing phone cases, trying multiple outlets, I cannot get this charger to work at all.

The charger is fairly small and using a large phone is not ideal. It still works, but the phone overhangs enough that a slight bump may discontinue the charging. I would recommend using a smaller phone, such as the iPhone 8 or similar.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I use this at the office, and I'll probably pick one up for home. Not much to say about it except that it is very easy to set up and use, and the charging time is pretty quick. I've noticed I get quicker charging times when I use an actual plug, but this is a nice supplement to charge my phone if I don't have a cable available.There is some residual heat exchange between the charger and the phone.

I have an overly protective phone case, and the charger still works.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
Unboxed plugged up to my exsisting phone charger adapter and used cord provided. Laid phone on charging pad and it started charging.

Charges my iPhone X quickly. I like that the ring around the outside lights up green to confirm I’ve got it seated well.

So far this working great for me . Plus, this charger is not expensive.",5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0
"Overall, this is a great product. Super easy to set up and begin using no installation work required. Was able to simply plug it in and set my phone on it to charge. Only complaint is the cords sent with this are too short. Approximately 3 feet in length each. It’s great to start up, but you’ll likely need to buy a new cord later.",4,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"Quick charge works nicely. However, when something isn't charging, there is an audible cycling noise coming from it, so I unplug it when I'm not using it, which is rather inconvenient. Wireless charging works well, but it has to be perfectly positioned, so a few times it hasn't started charging and I haven't noticed it. Also, the rubber ring on the top was peeling when I got it and still pops up from time to time.",3,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0
"When it works, it couldn't be better. I actually have two of these. One for work, one for home. The one at work works well, the home one often does nothing when I put the phone down on it.

"This is the only one I have so maybe this is consistent with all the wireless chargers, but it is annoying making sure it is in the exact right spot to charge. It also seems to take a long time to charge my brand new phone.

This charger doesn’t complete a full charge. It is locate on my wife’s nightstand. It starts to charge but will stop charging without notice.  In order to get the charger to work you have to unplug it from the wall and reinsert the charger back into the outlet.  This doesn’t work for charging my wife’s phone during the night.

"This works great for my Pixel 3 and Iphone 8 for work. Just plugged the included USB C cord into my pixel power adapter and it charges about 1% per minute or faster. Definitely not the slow charge, but not as fast as directly plugging in.

I started out plugging it into my USB-C hub at work and that just didn’t give enough power. That lead to a frustrating experience at first, but moving it around to a couple of different power sources proved successful. The one in my kitchen, plugged into the wall, operates fantastically.

It's surely slower than the wall but I don't have to worry about charging ports taking on wear from the many times I'd plug my phone in and out. I'm on it for work a LOT so to have this chilling on my desk where I can sit my phone when I'm not using it is great and keeps me juiced.,5,1,2019-2-6,1,0,0
"I have tried for the last two days to try and charge an Iphone 8 plus. The green flashing light comes on and kept flashing for more than thirty minutes without charging the battery. Surprisingly, it charges the apple AirPods pro.I am disappointed at that because it clearly states in their promo that it works for the airPods.",2,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I originally ordered this charger because I went on a trip and my 1 month old Samsung galaxy s9 plus stopped charging because of ""water damage"" as soon as I got back the charger was waiting for me and omg!!!!! It has not let me down. I've moved on to a new phone but I continue to use my wireless charger and it charges my phone very quickly. I can leave it in the charger and go take a shower and come back and be fully charged!!!! This is the only charger I use!!! Cannot pass it up!!!",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"I used this product for maybe an hour, I took my phone off then put it back on and it wouldn’t charge anymore. I took my phone case off and that wasn’t the reason & tried my air pods to see if it was just my phone as a whole but it wasn’t it was the charger. Unplugged it changed outlets & cubes still wouldn’t work. Very upset because I bought this since it was an amazon choice.",1,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"I ordered this instead of a cord because I am bad about bending and ruining chargers. It charges okay, I don’t think it is as quick of a charge as I get with my lightening charger. Also you can’t just sit the phone on it and go on about your business, I have to make sure it’s positioned perfectly or I wake up to a dead phone. Over all I’ll be using it just for guestsI got a new corded charger, much easier to know it’s right without the hassle 🤷‍♀️",3,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"This is super easy to use and great for conveniency! It does charge very very slowly (like maybe 1% every 5 ish minutes), but I don't know what people are expecting from this price. I recommend they get a higher quality charger if they need rapid charging, but this is definitely adequate enough when it comes to convenience",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
The charger is high quality and works like a charm. It does what it should. It has never overheat my phone or the charger itself. It also works with a high speed charger. This is the second unit I've bought. I bought the first one since Sept 2018 and it's January 2019 and I haven't had any problem with it. I just plug it in and I forget about it. Having a wireless charger definitely changes your life. I would never go back and It has never failed to charge my iPhone XS Max.This charger is so perfect that it turns on a green light once you place your phone on top of it as a visual cue to let you know that the phone is being charged(see image).,5,1,2019-1-25,1,0,1
"This charger started out great. It was easy to set up and use. Unfortunately, after about 2 months it stopped working for 1 of our two Iphones. So strange because the phones are the same model and are brand new.The convenience is great but unless it works on both my phones it is useless to me.",3,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"This is the second time we've purchased this product. We purchased one over a year ago, to go along with a new iPhone X. Yet another purchase prompted by Apple's decision to change the way their products charge. It's a great product. It turns green (just for a few moments) to let you know that you've placed your phone in the right place. Great product at a great price.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"I bought two of these about 4 weeks ago and they are still working fine.  I have a caseology case for a note9, so it is a pretty thin case.  Recently,  I ordered a thicker otterbox case because I'm going down to Mexico and will be outside more often and need more protection.  I'm not sure if this will work with the otterbox.  I think it may charge faster with no case, but can't confirm. For cheap wireless charging, I don't see any downside.",5,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0
Product comes well packaged giving it a high end feel. It comes with two power cords. It is convenient to use and has charges my phone well. This is my first wireless charger so I don’t have a comparison to other devices but I’m very happy with this. My only critique is that the cords could be a bit longer.,5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
This wireless charger works great for my iPhone XR. I like how it lights up to let you know that it’s working but then the light turns off so it won’t interfere with your sleep. That was an important feature to me as my last charger stayed illuminated all night. No problems so far!,5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"This whole wireless charging thing just seems so magical to me. I really feel like it’s something out of a sci-fi movie. But it actually works.This is my first wireless charger.

I absolutely love this charger! I use it daily to charge my phone and it works amazingly well. I even have a pop socket on my phone and it charges my phone through it. I love having it on my desk while I’m working because I can still easily see & use my phone but I don’t have a bunch of cords all over and in my way. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is considering buying it! I love it!,5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"Don't buy for use in bedroom unless you like flashing green lights to shine in the middle of the night.  The charger works fine but why it was designed to flash green lights on and off when charging is complete is beyond understanding.  If you want your bedroom to light up  like a Vegas casino at 2 AM, this is the charger for you.  I had to move it out of the bedroom or it would have ended up in peices in the corner had I let it continue to interrupt my sleep.",1,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"This product works exactly as advertised. It charges through the case without issue and charges fast. My only complaint and I know this is likely an issue that very few people would notice, when I lay in bed at night and it is quite this thing makes a clicking noise that will drive you nuts. So if you have bad hearing or do not charge near you in a quite room it is perfect.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"What could be easier than plugging in a cable to charge your phone overnight?  The answer is not plugging your phone in every night. The whole process is so easy that I view it as magic.  I actually look forward to laying my iPhone down on it and letting magic happen.  Thus, I never forget doing it and always have a fully charged phone ready to go in the morning.",5,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0
"I bought this because my eldest two have iPhones and iPads and they kept stealing my chargers. Luckily my wife and I are the only two with wireless charging capabilities. All I can say is, that I love it. It came in simple packaging and it was easy to assemble! It’s charges extremely quickly! Some night I’ll fall asleep with my phone in my hands and then wake up in the middle of the night with an almost dead phone. I’ll pop it on the charger and it’ll be completely charged in the morning. It doesn’t take up much room and it has a rubberized ring so it stays in place during the night and I never have to wonder where it is. It’s a great little charger and the price is even better!",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
"I bought 2 of these wireless chargers and I'm so glad I did. I took one to work and kept one at home. I'm SOOOO glad I did.

Very happy with my purchase and plan on buying another for my son's phone.",5,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0
"Burning electrical smell emanating from this when using. I've fried a few components, I know what burning copper smells like. Too cheap to bother with a return but definitely will be going with Anker components in the future (used there charging pad without issue). I should note that the stands (the ""newer"" version of this) hasn't had this issue.",2,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
"It charges very slow but it openly says that it charges slower than wired connections in the warranty guide, so it is great to be open and honest. My only hang up is how hot it makes my phone, despite my phone being inside it’s OtterBox Case. I don’t want my battery being fried by this charger and if it does end up frying, I would expect the warranty they say you should sign up for to pay for the repair to my phone. All in all it’s not a terrible product, but don’t get it if you have the fear of your phone overheating.",3,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
The charger is pretty good. Works with cases that are 4mm or less in thickness. For $10 you can’t go wrong.The only thing I don’t like is that the light on it goes off even though the phone is still charging. So sometimes I think it’s not charging when it really is.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
I ordered this charger for my son and he loves it. It's small and convenient.  It works with the iPhones and Samsung devices that are able to charge wirelessly. It is very inexpensive compared to other wireless charges. I was a bit skeptical because of the price but no it works great and I've had it almost a year now. Definitely worth the price.,5,1,2019-5-30,1,0,0
Was excited to try wireless charging with the new iPhone SE for the first time. And it works great!! Just plug this in and lay the phone on top. I read it may charge slower but it charges quickly! Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!,5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I forgot the samsung galaxy s7 edge has charging power and picked the cheapest one to try it out. The wireless charging pad itself has a very minimalistic look to it, just be careful to not confuse it with a coaster. With this being my only wireless charger I've own, it's hard to rate the power since I have nothing to compare it too. I'm sure it's fine though. It charged up my phone from 1 to 100 in about 1.4 hours , so ill give it 4 stars.",4,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"I’m a big fan of my Yootech wireless charger for two main reasons: 1) it charges my mobile effortlessly 2) I no longer have to worry about my lightning connector breaking and leaving me without a way to charge my mobile. It’s a pretty simple concept, plug the Yootech charger into an outlet and then pop your mobile on top to being wirelessly charging. That’s it. When you’re done you pick up your mobile and use it. All without any broken lightning cables. :-)Great quality, awesome price point, kind of a no-brainer. It even illuminates green when your phone begins charging. Easy-peasy!",5,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"This little thing has come to make life a bit easier in our house. We have different phones with different types of chargers and were constantly moving the chargers around to different rooms and forgetting to bring them back to the bedroom at night. I set this up in my living room so that we can charge while downstairs and leave the old chargers upstairs. It takes up very little room as you can see in my pictures and doesnt clash with the decor. Most importantly, it charges really fast!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that it charges both our iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. I will be buying another for the kitchen since we spend alot of time in there too.",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,1
"I shopped a lot of brands but bought the BELONGME.  I bought one & liked it so much that I bought one for my wife. It's a great item & have had no issues. The light comes on when the phone is properly center & goes off after 16 seconds. My wife uses it on her desk.  We both have the iPhone 11 & with clear cases. No issues going thru the case. Would recommend.  Great prices, easy to use.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"Purchased this for my iPhone 8 and it works great. Very easy and convenient to just set your phone down on top of the charger and grab it when you need to go, no more messing with lightning cords that always seem to fall off the nightstand or get pulled by my kids when phone is connected. The lights are a nice touch to let you know it is on and also indicates when charging is complete. Lights are only on for a few seconds so that bright lights are not an issue when trying to sleep. Very pleased; buying another for my wife’s iPhone 11 which also works on this charger. Our phones also have protective cases on them and they still charge without issue.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0

I bought the 2nd one because I thought it was my sons user error not putting it on the charger right, but we have to out our phones on this charger at least 3 different times before it will start charging, otherwise it will just flash and not charge.

I love it! My sister has a much more expensive wireless charger that she got from Sprint and compared to this one I’d say they’re about the same. It charges fast and is very easy to use.

"I absolutely love my Yootech wireless charger! It works perfectly and charges my iPhone quickly. After I bought my first one for my house, I bought another one for work. It's really convenient for work, because I'm getting up from my desk frequently and don't have to worry about plugging and unplugging the phone to charge it anymore. Instead, I place on the charger and the green light comes on briefly to let me know it's charging. This is a super helpful feature, especially at night time when I put my phone on the charger in the dark I know it's charging, because the green light briefly turns on but doesn't stay on which is ideal!!",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
Not a huge fan as my phone has a metal tab in the case for magnetic mount in my car. This did not perform well with that tab so I added a charger to my family room for my guests to use. It works but just not for my phone and it wasn’t worth the hassle to return.,3,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0

"Compared to another charging disk I bought, this one seems more cheaply built, and for some reason, it has a harder time pairing.  When I place my phone on the charging disk, some times it takes a couple of seconds for the phone to recognize the charger, or I have to move the phone around on the charger before they pair up.  Other than that, it does charge just fine.

I love it, it is easy to use and all you have to do is sit the phone on top of it. You don’t have to remove your phone case either. Great product.",5,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0
I have three of these and they have been one of my favorite tech purchases of 2018. Connecting is easy with no case. It can be a challenge however depending on the type of case(i use spigen). They work well once connected. I have learned that when I am setting it down with case on it is best that the phone is centered onto the charge pad and connection is pretty consistant.,5,1,2018-12-24,1,0,0
"This is a great product for wireless charging of my iPhone. I was so tired of dragging out a cord and plugging it in every time I had to charge. It sets up easy and it small enough to not be obtrusive on my nightstand. It's a little large for a travel charger. Beware it does not come with a wall charger, you have to purchase that separately. I wish that was made more clear in the product description.",4,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
Good product.  Will see how it does long-term.  I'm curious if the micro USB port lasts (I had one of these from another manufacturer that stopped working).  But so far the product works great.Warning.  You have to have the right plug to go with the charger.  I had the wrong one and couldn't use the charger.  Just make sure you purchase the right one - info is in the box on what to get.,5,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
I had a Samsung wireless charger and the immediate difference with this one is that you dont have to worry about your phone being placed perfectly on it. I have the galaxy s9+ which is not a small phone and this charger has no problems holding onto it. It also fast charges with the OEM samsung brick if your into that. The one thing I would say is that if you have any metal on your phone case then the charger will be finicky. Overall if you look at the price compared to big names this one is a no brainers.,5,1,2019-7-26,1,1,0
Really like the yootech flat charger have tried the anker stand charger. The yootech flat is easier to use. When you first put your phone on it a green lite ring lites but does not stay on so it's not a distraction at night. I tried to charge my iPad mini its a older one and the charger light ting flashes on off letting you know it is not able to charge wireless. Will be buying more.,5,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0

The fact that it is usb-c make the world of a difference because it has fast charging capability and probably the best reliability for any port product. You can find this on deal on the day on Amazon. It is also phone case friendly. My girlfriend has a big bulk case and still charges her phone. Would recommend!! Iphone just have a really poor port functionality to them that just does work in the long run this helps keep the longevity of the port.,5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"I researched and read quite a few reviews of the various wireless chargers. And the price ranges vary widely. So I decided to start with an inexpensive charger and chose the Yootech 7.5 wireless charger. I have an Iphone Xr that normally takes quite awhile to charge on a regular wall plug charger. The Yootech surprised me at how fast it charges the iphone. No problem setting it up. Very easy. It's been a month and still working fine. I have a case on the phone, and it still charges thru the case. I highly recommend the Yootech, you don't have to spend a lot of money on the expensive ones.",4,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0

Not as small Apple brand but a lot cheaper. Doesn’t charge my phone every time it’s on the base and sometimes I have to pick it up and re place it.

Overall this product is reliable and charges my phone over night pretty well.  The only issue I have with this unit is that when my phone has completely died it will not charge it at all.  I can leave it on all night and it wont have any juice in the morning but if it had 1% when i put it on it would be fully charged at night.  Super annoying,3,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"This is very easy and convenient to use. I was worried about whether it would work with an Otter Box case on my iPhone XS Max...no problem!

"I originally ordered this for my car so I could charge my iPhone 8 and use an aux cord at the same time, and the product works pretty well. If I had an area wide enough to lay it down flat (other than the passenger seat), it would work better but that’s just a matter of the vehicle. Fast forward a few months, Yootech reached out to me to see if I was satisfied and I informed them that sometimes it takes a couple tries to start charging and I have to unplug/re-plug it in on occasion, and support was incredibly friendly and helpful. Within two days I received another model with a stand to better secure the phone and it works great! Definitely worth the purchase and rest assured if you have any issues, Yootech support will respond quickly and work to make you happy.",4,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
"After I had the product for 10 months, it seemed to have stopped working and I submitted a scathing review only to discover that it had gotten turned over.

The charger is OK, but there are times when it just didn't charge the phone (even though the lights confirmed it was charging when it was placed on the charger). I bought two of these and only one has had the issues so far so maybe it was a fluke.

I charge up overnight right by my bed and it is a million times more convenient than a cord charger. It’s small, sleek and lightweight too.

The rubber grip that holds the phone in place is also top notch.The only drawback to a wireless charger with one charging coil is that you have to hit the “sweet spot” to enable charging. This is very difficult to do when your phone has an attachment or magnet on back. I have a magnet on the back of my phone to mount on my dash when driving. If I position my phone perfectly I can charge, but, this doesn’t always happen.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,1

The charger works very well with my LG ThinQ G7 and V35. Charges as fast or faster than other wireless chargers I've used. I like that it glows green around the edges when initially making contact with the charge Center on the phone.My only complaint is that the rubber ring on the bottom of the charger has an adhesive that sometimes allows the rubber grip ring to detach from the charger. The adhesive stays sticky though and I am able to put the ring back on. Maybe a less pliable adhesive would be the only upgrade for this unit.,5,1,2019-4-5,1,0,0

Then all of a sudden 2 days shy of 6 months since purchase, it just stopped working.  If I unplug it and plug back in, it lights up green for a second as if everything were fine.

It doesn’t come with a block to attach to the charger though and I had an extra one that was a 5V and it charges like any normal one but I think I’ll purchase a higher voltage one so my phone will charger faster because when it’s sitting on the charger you can’t like use your phone like you normally would when it’s still on the charger unless you moved the whole counsel which with the long cord you could but it’s not idea but if I have a higher one I won’t have to worry about being away from my phone for too long if I need to use it while it needs to charge.,5,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"Works pretty good. I'm able to charge it through my phone case. Wish it charged faster but it's not a perfect world. Only real issue is making sure it's put on the right spot and you don't bump it because it will stop charging if bumped even a little bit off alignment.Using it with my Galaxy Note 9, fyi. Had it for almost 2 months.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"Both sides of the unit have a rubberized ring which prevents the charger from sliding on the table and the phone from sliding off of the charger. The unit is larger than most charging pads and my phone does not need to be perfectly centered to begin charging. Charging is fast.When charging begins, the unit lights up for 15 seconds. It would be nice if the time that the was configurable (or could be toggled off) -- I would prefer it not light up at all at night. Still, it is an improvement over other chargers with bright status indicators that never turn off.",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
This is cool because it comes with two cords one to plug into a wall charger and one that plugs into my Macbook Air laptop ( newest model of 2020) HOWEVER I can't charge my phone with a case on and also it has to be on the pad just perfectly to charge. Which is fine as long as you check that it's charging in the right place before walking away. It's fine but it's not amazing!,3,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"This will work for about 2 months for my IPhone 11 then stop working completely after the return policy is over. As someone who is willing to spend extra on nice-to-have item rather than must haves, this isn’t worth your while.",1,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
I love this wireless charger! I have gotten ones at trade shows including ones made by Samsung and this is the absolute best! It charges rather quickly and after placing my device on top the light goes out completely. That light thing is also great point because so many of them remain on and are annoying and bright. This is a great product!,5,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0
Ordered this as a cheap extra to keep in my suitcase for travel. Ended up using it every day as a regular charger in the kitchen. It has been in daily use for 6 months.

"Low profile, space saver; quiet charging for overnight near  bed stand; fast charging for low battery power while in need; light indicator to show position it on right charging position; low heat generation to prevent any potential fire hazard; slip free when place the phone on charger as well as on slippery table.

"Used one of these for 2 years and loved it.  Then it stopped working, so I bought another and same issue.  You have to unplug it from wall, count to five, then plug it back in for it to charge again.  Then it will stop charging completely after 15 to 20 min.

Since its a puck you have to be careful to put the phone down so it is in the sweet spot to charge. Does not seem charge particularly fast but I don't know that a wireless charger could charge as fast as a plug. I only purchased because I was tired of plugs not working after a few months.,5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"We love this product! No hassle of trying to find wires in the middle of the night when you wake up from dead sleep to find your phone dead. Just lay it on there and forget about it.

Just of a piece of advice though, if you have a pop socket on your phone it will not work it has to have direct contact to work. Thats not a downfall though its still amazing.",5,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0

I use this charger with a Pixel 4 XL and it works good IF you center it perfectly. One thing I dislike about it is that it will light up green but not charge. It should only light up if it is charging. That makes way more sense.,4,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0

I thought that this charger would make charging easier by no longer fumbling with charger cord and iPhone receptacle in a dark bedroom.  It would have succeeded if it could have charged through my phone case.  Who doesn’t put their phone in some sort of protective case?,3,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"This is a nice charger. It’s compact for travel use and easy to use. Unfortunately, each charge is progressively slower than the last.

Giving it one star and only for the first week. Worked amazing. Charged every time I laid my phone on it. So convenient. Unplugged and moved for the weekend to my girlfriends and wouldn’t come on or charge. Tried several different plugs and several different times.  Went back to my old charger. Then after a while I noticed my phone didn’t hold charge like it use to. My phone is less than a year old and now it’s dead before the end of the work day.

It seems like a great product. This is the sixth wireless charger that I have bought and maybe it’s just my luck but not one of them has been able to charge with the case on. Definitely not the products fault. Charges quick. Maybe could use a longer cord.,5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Works like a charm. I have a thick, rubbery case and it has no trouble penetrating the case. It works very fast, and there's a fairly decent sized space I can place the phone on and it will trigger the charging, so it doesn't have to have precise alignment. I just set it relatively centered and away it goes.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I keep this on my nightstand and charge my phone while I sleep. It works great, but can take a bit of time.

Very portable, I can take it anywhere and plug it in.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0

I had to move it a couple of centimeters for it to start charging.It also charges pretty slowly.

I've ordered more than one type of wireless charger and this Yootech charger works perfectly for me. It is small enough to travel with and the charging notification light is around the side so it is easily visible that the phone is in the correct position. It also blinks green when the phone is put on the base upside down. Some wireless chargers don't work with certain phones but this one has worked with all of the phones we have in our home.

Great LED ring to indicate if it's charging correctly. Zero issues!",5,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0

I keep this on my nightstand to charge my iPhone or my AirPods w/charging case. I went  through a few other chargers before buying this one. It just works. The charging speed is good.

"I bought this because my sister has a wireless charger, a friend recommended this one however she has a galaxy phone and I have an XR , I don’t use it much because when I place my phone down to charge, it will charge for 15 minutes and then stop, it is unreliable and requires a different wall plug in than the iPhone so you also have to buy a more powerful wall plug, it is not fast charging either, I don’t recommend it, very unhappy with this product.",1,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"I bought this charger after reading a lot of reviews, and looking at all of the options on Amazon. I went with Yootech because it offered all the charging options of pricier chargers, but was incredibly affordable. A few months in, and I have no regrets with my purchase. It’s reliable, doesn’t heat up, and is lightweight and durable as well. The rubber ring keeps your iPhone firmly on top of it, and as long as I center my iPhone on the ring, it easily charges through my Encased phone case. I highly recommend.",5,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
I loved this charger so much I bought 2 more and i'm planning to buy at least one more.  Perfect for leaving on nightstand for easy charging.

Love it!,5,1,2019-1-11,1,0,0
"Most disappointing purchase from Amazon to date. Maybe I've gotten spoiled with with fast chargers, but this left a lot to be desired. I purchased it thinking that this would be great to just drop my phone on to charge during a busy day.

"Like many reviews on here, it worked great for a few days. Now, it won’t stay on more than three seconds. If I unplug and plug back in the green light goes on, then goes off in about 3 seconds. It stayed on my kitchen counter the entire time I had it. At $10 it isn’t even worth trying to return. I suppose that is what Yootech is counting on. They tricked me out of $10, but based on the pattern of so many similar reviews, and Yootech posting nothing about this very common issue, I will never buy anything from them again. Another example of why Apple products are always better then the cheaper ones.",1,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Charges my iPhone X quite quickly. You do have to make sure your phone is centered on the pad or you might miss your phone's charging ""sweet"" spot.

It’s easy to travel with as well.The only thing is, when I’m in a hurry I don’t realize the phone is not centered correctly on the charger, and I don’t notice the green light around the edge of the charger flash.  So a couple of times I woke up to find my phone didn’t charge, but now I make sure the green light comes on.  Plus it vibrates, so I look for both signs (light and vibration) that the charger is activated.",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"Great charger, especially for the price. Bought this for my husbands iPhone 8 due to him yanking his original chargers out of his phone causing it to mess the port up. I will buy him one more to have as a back up.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
Better than my Anker equivalent (my only basis for comparison). it charges quicker and it’s more obvious when the device is positioned to charge. (The blue light goes out after a few seconds so it’s not annoying.),5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"works perfectly . I was hesitating of getting this, it look too cheap to be for real. but it is awesome! it has worked perfectly for months already and still staying strong. easy to carry. i use it to charge my android phone",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"Works great. I have a Samsung S9 that was taking forever to charge, if it charged at all. I was about to go get a new battery or even a new phone. This wireless thing solved the problem. Much faster than the cord charger. Maybe an hour, hour and a half. Very satisfied.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,1
"My family loves this charger! It is ridiculously convenient, no searching in the dark for the power cord. The charger lights up when a phone is placed on the charger so you know your phone is charging (turns off quickly so you can sleep). Charges really quickly and has worked really well for all our iPhone’s 8+. A month of daily usage and still works like new.",5,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
"I like the green ring around it that lights up when it is charging correctly. Others have a small LED on one side, but this one has an entire ring around the charger that lights up when your device is positioned correctly.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
AWFUL DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I tryed everything for this stupid charger. I tryed it on iPhone no case and Samsung no case. I tryed numerous charging ports. 2A and absolutely nothing. What a piece of crap definitely will be returning,1,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Update! It’s been 3 months and this garbage charger almost started a house fire . It was burning hot and the connection between the plate and cord melted, if It weren’t for someone near by who noticed It was hot It would have definitely started a fire. Buyers beware DO NOT PURCHASE.",1,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"It has worked very well for 2+ months, and I wouldn’t hesitate to buy again. I love that I can keep it in the bedroom without lights. It lights momentarily when you sit the cell down, but it doesn’t stay on. Perfect for sleeping...& charging. You pick it up in the am with no unplugging. Wonderful!",5,1,2019-4-20,1,0,0
"It charges ok, but they don't send the wall charger. First time I send the package back and replaced with another as it was missing the wall charger, but again they didn't send me the wall charger again.This time I didn't have patience so just ketp it It is ok, nothing great for the price and they never send complete set",3,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0

Works as expected. Love the green ring that shows when it's charging...easy to see from across the room. Never fails to start charging immediately when the phone put in place. Others I've used seem to require a just-right placement to activate but this one seems less picky. Very happy.,5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
"This Yootech wireless charger is as simple as can be to use. Placing my iPhone Xs on the charge lights the ring of LED light for 15 seconds so I know I’ve place it correctly. After that the light turns off so as not to interrupt my sleep and it works great.I would recommend a heavier build for a mor luxury feel, but as I rarely touch the charger this is a minor concern.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0

"Still going strong! This has worked flawlessly with my iPhone 8 for over a year, and it's been so good that I bought a second for my wife's new iPhone X. Very well build, and the fact that you only have the green ""charging"" light for a few moments is very nice. I've seen a fe others that are lit all the time, so this is much better if you keep your phone charging in your bedroom at night.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
Great charger. I have a galaxy S8 active and the charging port is loose and the USB C Connection does not always make good contact. I got tired of fighting with it every day and night and waking up to find either a dead phone or really low charge in the morning.I like how the ring lights up to let you know it's charging but goes out after a few seconds so it does not bother me at night.,5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"I purchased two of these chargers when my wife and I purchased our Samsung Galaxy S9 phones.  We used our fast chargers from our old Galaxy S5 phones to connect these into the wall outlet.  Both work great, have been using them for a couple of months now.  While it does not charge as fast as a physical connection, even a fully discharged phone is charged to 100% by the morning.  I wanted wireless because I broke the connector on my Galaxy S5 when I was late for a plane and walked off with my phone, forgetting it was plugged in and charging.  No more concerns with breaking a connector with a wireless charger.  Great value for a charger that does exactly what it needs to do.",5,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
I purchased two of these chargers and within a few months time each of them have stopped working,1,1,2020-6-2,1,1,0
"Bought this charger to use with my iphone x, works very well for what i need it for. I currently just place it aside my bed and use it for mostly overnight chargeing. I really enjoy how the light comes on to assure charging is confirmed and then turns off shortly after to prevent any annoying lights while im sleeping. From what i can tell it charges pretty fast, however since i only have the iphone x i can not comment on the 10 W charging, only the 7.5W. Everything is pretty great about the product, the only thing wish was alitte better would be the materials used may be alittle cheap, but this hasnt caused any problems with my usage",5,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0
I just give it a try because never had a wireless phone charger before. This one has good reviews and price is good.I am surprised by the quality of this charger. Have it for months with no problem at all.,5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"It did what it was designed to do. Personally returning it because it didn't really meet my needs as you will be lifting your phone from the charger anytime you need to use it, can't watch movies or anything while charging since it's laying flat. Functional if you want it while you're sleeping but not great if you still need to use the phone while it's charging. Just bought a standing wireless charger to replace this and it definitely meets my needs!",3,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"This is hands down one of the best items I’ve ever purchased on Amazon! It drove me crazy dealing with all the iPhone chords either breaking, splitting or not working anymore. This is not only super affordable, but works amazing. I love how it lights up green for 2 seconds when you set it on there at night so you know it’s begun charging. I have had no issues with it at all! I thought that since I had a pretty heavy duty case on my phone that it wouldn’t charge, but it still works even with the case! My whole family uses it now and it works on Androids as well. I may have to get another one to travel with me because I don’t think I’ll be able to go back to the regular charging chord.",5,1,2019-5-26,1,0,0
"This is now my 4th wireless charging pad. I bought a few on Wish and got what a paid for...pieces of junk. For those thinking they can get a cheap wireless charger and it fast charge forget it. Just buy this one, it's not that expensive and works just like the name brand samsung pad.",4,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"First time using a wireless charger.  It charges through my leather case, kind of slow, but it is so easy to just put the phone on there.  I plug in overnight but for using during the day in the living room it's great! Helpful too for guests.  The cord is kind of short a longer one would be better.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
Great idea.  Come home set phone in and DDT one. Use it for note 10 and 8s Samsung both with cases.  Need to make you set it on so it is correct location to charge  it we I'll light up and phone will make a noise to acknowledge connection,4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"The charger works as advertised depending on the case on your cell phone. My case has a metal circle on the back that attaches to a magnetic car phone mount. If I leave the case on the phone, it will not wirelessly charge. If I take the case off, it will charge. My son has a similar case without the metal circle, and his phone charges just fine. If your case is like mine and you don't mind taking off the case when your phone needs charging, then this charger is a great choice.",4,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"I need to warn all of the people who are enamored at how cheap this is...to remind you why this product is so cheap. That is because it doesn’t work all of the time. And this is fact.  It might not even work a quarter of the time. I’ve purchased two of these, shame on me, and both are equally terrible. Half of the time I’ll wake up in the morning to find that it hasn’t charged at all. The other half I’ll try to put it on the charger only to see the green light blink constantly no matter the position I put my phone in. If you are reading this, please know that I’m an IT Manager and I know what I’m doing, and I would in no way recommend purchasing this product.",1,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"My daughter and I both use The Yootech wireless chargers and love them. It’s nice to be able to grab your phone and not hassle with the cable and plug-in.

Buy one, you won’t be disappointed!",5,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
"This is definitely more of a charger that should be connected to a wall outlet. I need a wireless charger for when I’m at work and I use the USB connector on my computer. It my phone so slow, my phone heats up, and sometimes it randomly stops working. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this to be used with your computer’s USB connector.",3,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"The device worked well until I put a case on the phone.  Now the device indicates an error and does not charge the phone.  I didn’t think the case was thick enough to cause an issue, but apparently I was wrong.  The device works very well without a case.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"This charger is simple to use. The pad is spacious enough for my iPhone with clear charging icons to let you know it’s working!  The pad turns green when it starts charging.  I have had other chargers that didn’t work, but I would certainly endorse this one.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"This wireless charger actually worked! I recently purchased two others of another brand. One of those worked for a few minutes but would stop charging the phone and the other never even charged the phone at all. I also liked the green light letting me know it was in the right place to charge and that it would turn off on its own after just a few seconds. Not the quickest charger but I usually only need to charge my phone at night. It may be night if you work at a computer, but I don’t.",4,1,2018-4-19,1,1,0
"One of the best chargers I've ever had. It looks so nice and sleek and it charges fast. I bought one for my computer desk, one for my nightstand at home, one for my nightstand at my boyfriend's house, and one for my mom. My mom also loves it. You will not regret buying this.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0

This replaced my traditional bedside charger and I absolutely loved it. So easy to pick up your phone when u need it and the phone charges well. I only wished that it could have used lightening cable instead of Android so I didnt have to carry another cable while traveling.

"I mean it’s really nice to have when you just need to throw your phone on the charger and walk away. For traveling you’d need a place to set everything down and depending on if there is a table near you, you might have to set your phone on the ground and personally I don’t want my phone accidentally kicked off its charger😂 or when you’re busy and you want to use your phone while it’s charging it’s not great for that. But it charges my phone just fine there isn’t any issues with the actual charging part itself and I like it a lot for that. I use it mostly when I’m sleeping.",4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"Green light continued to turn on and off and seemed to not charge my phone consistently.

"Get what you pay for. This thing is affordable, but is noticeably slower than the two other wireless chargers I routinely use. Ive used this one nightly for the last six months with no problems, but beginning a week ago, it randomly stops charging, even when everything is aligned correctly. If I unplug the entire unit and replug it back in, it'll charge for 15-20 min before cutting off again. I've switched outlets, USB bases, cords, etc and it seems to be the charging base itself. Decent for the price, but next time I'll invest in something a little more durable.",3,1,2019-2-7,1,0,0
"I used to think wireless charging was a gimmick - until I had multiple devices' charge ports (and the corresponding cables) wear out to various degrees (including a Nexus 7 tablet, a Galaxy S4 smartphone, a Pixel 2XL smartphone, a Windows tablet computer...).Anyways, my latest device (a used Nexus 5) happens to have Qi charging, so I decided to try it out so the above list doesn't get any longer.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0

I originally received two as a gift and since then I have purchased a third. I love this charger from a design perspective and for its functionality.

"I've now had mine for one year and can wholeheartedly endorse this product. Me and my family use it constantly near the kitchen and it's worked perfectly.

Fantastic charger! We like this one more then our mophie one and it’s a lot cheaper! Works better!!  Love the light up lights around to so you know it’s charging and the extra cord inside is a bonus as well.  We have the one in the living room and it’s perfect!,5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
The led lights are very bright to let you know if it is charging correctly.  If you do not place your phone quite right it will blink a few times to let you know to scoot it over a little bit.  But the lights turn off after a few seconds so you can sleep without any lights on.  Charges fast and is much easier than sticking a cord in the phone.,5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0

This charger works as advertised.  No doubt about it.  The only thing preventing a 5 start is the length of the micro USB included.  A 6ft would have been nice in stead of a 3ft.  But thats not a statement on the quality of the product overall.  I'm nitpicking at this point.  Buy this if you need a wireless charger.,4,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0
"Thin and light, and fairly compact. Easy to set up. It comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable and a USB-C to USB-C cable, so it will work with almost any high-speed charger.I’m using one for myself, and I plan on getting one of these for my wife to keep at the office, too.",4,1,2019-10-1,1,0,1
When I bought it I thought i'll give it a try. My Iphone 8+ was encased in a thick Otterbox case and to my surprised it worked great with no issues.

"I have an iPhone Xs Max and and have no issues with this charger. I did buy a QC power brick to connect it to, and I’m content with the charging speeds (even if i can’t get the full power with the iphone). My only criticism is to maybe add an led indicator letting you know which power mode it’s using (5/7.5/10 volts, just to be sure) but other than that, I’ve had zero issues using this for the past couple of months. I highly recommend if you’re simply looking for a basic wireless pad to charge your devices, it’s cheap yet durable and effective and I could definitely see myself buying more once I get more compatible wireless charging devices",5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
This product is amazing!!! My iPhone 8 plus charges to 100% overnight and lasts me twice as long than using a regular iPhone charger.

"This works fine with cases and everything, love how the light turns on so you know it’s started to charge. Just annoyed that sometimes you put it on and you’re just a little bit off center and it won’t charge. Has to be placed pretty well for it to start charging. You can’t just like toss it in the direction of it and hope and pray. You gotta hold it until it’s touching the pad to make sure you do it correctly. Probably a 4 1/2 but can’t do that.",4,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0

Easy to set up and use this charger. Was working well. Until I was 9 days past the return window. It is intermittently charging. I have tried different outlets but same result. My phone is not fully charged by morning when I leave it on overnight.,3,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
I got an empty box with only instructions and 1 cord.  Obviously was a return as there was a sticky protective cover left that had to be peeled off.  Or perhaps the produce and 2nd cable were never packaged?,2,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"So for starters this charger is by no means ""fast"". Which was fine because for us we would use it overnight  and the phone would be charged by morning!

"I'm rather disappointed, the product works but does not charge as quickly as I hoped. I have the s10, and I have a different wireless which states as 10w charging. That wireless charger charges my phone in approximately 1 hour. This Yootech one is only able to charge my phone in 2 hours. I hoped that it could charge as fast as my other but it couldn't. In the end this one was 50% cheaper and my expectations shouldn't have been as high.",3,1,2020-1-10,1,0,1
I bought my new iPhone X and didn’t know I could wirelessly charge it. This was the first product with the best review I found. I’ve been using it for two months now and can honestly say I haven’t had a single problem. I’ve even dropped water on it and it’s just fine. The size of the pad is perfect on my night stand. I’ll prolly get another one for work :),5,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0
"Works great for charging iPhone X. Especially if you charge only at night. Works through thick Otterbox case but takes longer. Not an issue. Just charge at night and your good for the day even if your up early and have long day. A few hours at night is enough time even through a defender series case which is their thickest, and a must if you pay for such an expensive phone yourself, which has breakable glass on the front and the back of the phone.",5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0

Works well with my Incipio case. My husband has a thicker plastic cover and has to remove it to charge. Wish it came with a little travel case- but all in all it’s great. Charges quickly.

Charges too slow and the product is super temperamental. You have to make sure that it is placed just right on a surface for the phone to catch charge.

Then you pick up your phone and realize that it is still charging...,5,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0

"I bought two of these wireless chargers; one for the living room and one for my night stand. They come in simple packaging, but seem to be made of decent plastic and do not feel cheap.

Solid construction, doesn't look horrible, the ring around the outside that lights up to let you know it's charging is neat, and it came with TWO usb-a to usb-c cables.

"Amazing wireless charger, when you put the device on it to charge it lights up to show that charging started. Can’t say much about charging speeds, for quick charge it’s noticeable slower than using wired charging, so it’s good for night charging of the phone. I saw it once blinking, I thought that means that it can sense that the device is fully charged, or that you are trying to charge a fully charged device, can’t say what it means.",5,1,2019-4-20,1,0,0

I’ve had this chatger for quite some time now and I cant see myself charging my phone any other way.It was well worth the price. The cord is a good length (not to short/long). The block (plug) is good quality. The rubber is held on well and I personally like having it light up to let you know it’s charging (it dosnt stay on so it’s not distracting).,4,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0

So far the charger is working well. I’ve only had it for a few weeks but it’s been great to charge overnight. I like that it stops charging when it’s reached 100% (or seems to anyway).

I thought I purchased something for convenience but turned out to be more of a problem.,2,1,2019-11-26,1,1,0
This Yootech Qi charger lasted a whole 3 charges before dying on me. I now get to go the weekend with no phone. I would not recommend this product. I guess I got a bad one? The rating of this device is very high. I'm going with Aukey. Ive always had good luck with their products.,1,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"This charger is wonderful as an wireless charger. It's the first and only inter ive used with my phone. My only issue, this the 4 star rating is if I don't set it just right at night it doesn't charge. They're us a green light that indicates it's charging... that helps, but if it gets bumped from that position it stops charging.It is still an incredible charger... so i just purchased my second one to have at my computer!",4,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I have tried many chargers with cases for my S9.  I really dont want to pay $50 for one.  Then I found this one.  I have a Unicorn Beetle case and this works flawlessly.  I have had the charger for almost a year  and bought a second several months ago.  Fast charging, decent size cord.  I will be buying more soon.",5,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
"This charger is awesome!  I can't believe how fast it charges my phone.  I set my phone on the charger, the light indicates it is charging and I walk away.  I come back in a short time and the phone is 100% I cannot recommend this charger enough.  It is so sleek and takes up next to no space.  I love it!!",5,1,2018-12-29,1,0,0
The charger does not supply a wall transformer. The charger is supplied with two cables that will plug into the phones wall transformer. This works very well with my iPhone 11. A flashing circle is displayed when the phone links to the charger.,4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"How do they do it, no wires, no nothing. This may be witchery but man does it work. I use this at work and it has had a significant impact on my office popularity. Straight to the front of the water cooler line. Great product and a fast charge.",5,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
"Once you are able to get phone on it to start charging works fine. But it isn’t as easy as just set phone down and go, You have to play with it till it connects and then any little touch can make it disconnect and stop charging even if still placed on charger.",3,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
It says it doesn’t charge very quickly...it does for me. The only think that I get a little annoyed with is that you have to set it on their JUST RIGHT...but you know it’s changing when the light comes on...it’s something to get use to. But all in all it’s really good to have. I wouldn’t travel with it...that was a question..that’s gonna be a no from me,5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"Yes it’s super easy to use. Worked great for a week. Now it won’t charge anything at all. I thought maybe it was just one, so I pulled out the second one I bought at the same time. Same thing happened. It will charge, but after about 20 minutes it stops.",1,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"This is the best purchase I've made since buying an iPhone 10. I hated reaching over from bed to find my charger, but now I can just lay it right on top of this one. No ugly cords and no breaking my back. It lights up for about 3 seconds to let you know it's positioned correctly and charging.",5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
This charger works great. It buzzed as soon as I placed my phone on it to let you know that it’s beimg charged. The light at the bottom also lights up.  It charge 100% pretty quickly after a few hours.  I have not had any trouble about this charger not working right or not charging. It works great for me. I have IPhoneX. It also work on Android cause my kids has android phone and we tested it. I would different buy it again.,5,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0
Very happy with this product.  The light lets me know I have the phone in the area needed to charge and then the light dims away allowing me to sleep.  It isn't insanely picky on placement other than the phone needs to be somewhat centered.  Been using this quite some time now and have no complaints.,5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0

Yes and yes. I got one for Christmas and was so impressed with it I bought one for my mother who was immobile at the time. It was very convenient for her to be able to keep the phone charged and nearby but not have to deal with a cord dropping or being too short.,5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Just received this product yesterday, and it easily went together and charged my phone to 100%.  FYI, I have a phone protector on and it charged right through the plastic material. hopefully the product holds up over time. Note, there is a sweet spot to get the charger to begin charging when the phone is centered on it, when that happens a green ring will light up around the side of the charger and charging begins. It’s very handy for me so far.",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"What a great product! Works with my new iPhone XS and had no trouble charging through my new Incipio Case. Once plugged in a green light indicates that it’s charging and love how easy it is to use. Place on chargjng surface and walk away, no struggling to place the sharper inside the port. It’s simply the best iPhone accessory I have ever bought! AMAZING!",5,1,2018-12-30,1,0,1
I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks now with my iPhone XS and it is very good would recommend. It charges faster than a wire would. Comes with details for charging instructions which were very helpful. The led light is not overwhelming and turns off after a couple of seconds. Very small and light would be great for traveling. The only complaint i have is that it does not handle vibrations very well. With two or three texts the phone has shifted  and will not charge. If i don’t put my phone on do not disturb @ night i will find my phone on the ground not fully charged.,4,1,2019-3-17,1,0,1

"This charger has been fantastic. I have a pretty dense case on my phone so most charger I have tried had a hard time. As long as you use a good charging block at the wall and cord, this charging pad will work wonders. I know- its just charging the phone, pretty standard- but after working to find one that works, it feels great to just drop my phone next to me on the desk (on the charger of course) and not worry about picking it up to find it's at 8% still. Would definitively buy again or gift to a friend.",5,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0
The device works great. I am able to charge my phone without taking it out of the otter box case. I have a iPhone 8 and and able to use my headphones and and charge my phone at the same time. I enjoy the ease at home and work where I don’t have to look for a charging cable to plug in my phone. I can just place my phone down on the charger and let it charge. Going to purchase another one for my office.,5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,1
"It works excellent. Advise though, take the case off the phone, before changing it. Or keep your eyes on it it might  cause the battery to get hot. I have a think case it it was getting a little hot, but once you take the case off, it works great.",5,1,2018-5-25,1,1,0

"Great product that has been easy to use and works seamlessly in the 12 months I have had it. I actually bought a second device so that one sits by my bedside and one on my kitchen counter. The soft green glow is soothing and an easy confirmation that the phone is charging.NB: I received a small monetary gift in exchange for this review, but I have liked the product anyway over the last 12 months; this just incentivized me to log on and post.",5,1,2019-4-4,1,0,0
The charger is good as long as your phone is without any case. I had difficulty with thicker phone cases. I switched to thinner phone case and now it works fine. From price stand point I guess it's okay. Packaging was really good. I wish they had spent more money on product than packaging.,3,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
I have been wanting this style charger for work but have been putting it off.  I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. I love it because it keeps my phone charged all day and it is easy to use while charging. The price is very reasonable!,5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
Product works good but note that it does not come with the electric outlet adapter which requires a special unit for faster charging. That means more expense to get what you need aside of this. Just wish that it was included so I don’t have to purchase it after the fact and through another provider.,4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"This think works sometimes, I don’t know if it’s because I’m in the cold trying to use this. Or if it was from the sticker I put on. I think it is my case. Basically it can’t charge through a phone case so kinda worthless because many of us drop our phones often to not be willing to take the case off just to charge it.",1,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"Charger works, but it does take longer to charge if you use the 5V 1Amp charger that comes with phone (the price paid for induction). If your phone has a popsocket, then charging will be touchy. A small bump with cause charging to stop.",4,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0

There are many choices when looking to get a charging pad, and I am honestly so glad I found this one by Yootech. It is the best bang for you buck. Not only has it worked flawlessly the past 8 months that I have had it, but it was by far the most economical one on the market.

My wife sometimes doesn't get her 8+ on the pad in the right place and it doesn't charge.  I have yet to wake up to an uncharged phone.  They both work well.  I use an iPad charging brick for mine, and my wife uses her standard iPhone charging adapter.  If the LED color was able to be changed, that'd be awesome!

I would love it if it worked with the case on. I never take the case off and it's a hassle to take off so I will end up returning this product. My case is a thin silicone case but it might be the magnet for my car holder that is preventing the charge to come through.,2,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
I ordered this wireless charger just to see how wireless charging worked and if it would be more convenient as I'm constantly disconnecting my phone from a charger to attend meetings throughout my workday.

The only issues I have with this charger are that it takes a while to charge your phone but that's to be expected when talking about wireless charging.

It has a green ring that lights up when you place the phone down so you know the phone has made connection and started charging.

I took time for each 1% charge, while the other chargers and even directly plugged took about 2 ~ 3 minutes to charge, this wireless charger managed to do it in under 1 minute. It lights up a green light when you place your phone to indicate charging has begun. Will definitely buy more and place them throughout the house.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,1
This is the second Yootech charger I bought. I bought the first one for myself. But every time I went to put my phone on it at night. My Husband would have his on it. So I bought a second for my Husband (Or should I say for Myself) Much easier then trying to plug into a wire plug in the dark or in a hurry.,5,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0
"I bought 2 Yootech Qi-Certified Wireless Chargers. I was initially attracted by the low price ,compared to other similar chargers, as well as the features. But the great reviews (4.4 out of 5) pushed me over the top and I have not been disappointed. Both chargers live up to their promise, quickly charging my 10W Samsung Note 9 phone while in the case without getting hot. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the charger. It is small enough to fit on the palm of my hand, making it easy to take with me.I would definitely recommend this charger to family, friends and strangers.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0

This little thing works great...as long as you don't have a pop socket on your phone/case. It won't charge through the pop socket. My pop socket is on my case so in order to charge it I have to take my case off which I hate doing because we have hardwood floors and the last thing I want is to drop it when I pull it off the charger and crack my phone screen. If I didn't have a pop socket I think I'd love this thing! But I don't really use it because taking off my case just turned out to not be a plausible option for me.,5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0

This wireless charger sits on my nightstand for charging my iPhone at night.  It lights up once the phone is placed atop and then after about 10 or 15 seconds the lights switch off.  My phone (in a medium-thick case) charges quickly every time.  A great product for the money.,5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0

This charger has been great!  It is so much easier than plugging my phone into a lightning cable and you can just set your phone down and go.  It is also much faster than charging with a traditional cable.  I was surprised at how quickly my phone was able to charge on it.  For the price you can't beat this!,5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
Purchased for my wife. No more brittle wires to break. Just put your phone on top and it charges. Only con I have seen is phone must be removed from the case if you have one.  Other than that no issues.,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0

It worked well for about 2 months. The other night we were watching TV and detected a weird burning plastic smell. We went into the kitchen and found this charger melting (see picture). Good thing we were home at the time as my phone was not charging.  It just began burning all in its own. Crazy.,1,1,2020-5-9,1,1,1
I bought this charger when I purchased my iPhone XR and it took for ever to charge. Literally it was charging the whole night and in the morning it was at 93%. A few weeks later I noticed the green light started to just blink and it stopped charging my phone. I unplugged it and tried it again. And it did not work. It’s been in my drawer for 8 months now after two weeks of use.,1,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0

It worked good for a few days. But then it started over heating while it was charging my phone. My phone would heat up as well. All the way down the cord was warm too. Maybe something was wrong with just mine but be aware.,2,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
It’s good..and it may just be me.. just not life changing. It is in no way a rapid charge. If the phone isn’t perfectly placed it doesn’t charge at all.Update: Yootech contacted my and sent me a replacement - the upright one. It charges much better and consistently. Because the product does what is advertised and the special treatment by their team I feel the adjustment in ***** was necessary. Wish all companies handled business this way!,5,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0
Charger worked great for the first month. Would start charging it at night with 15% and wake up in the morning with 40% charge. It would stop charging after the first 30 minutes. You would have to unplug it for a few minutes before plugging it in before trying to charge your phone again.,1,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
It’s worked great on my iPhone 8 Plus. My only complaint is that you have to have your phone in a certain spot for it to work so definitely make sure the green light comes on. I wish I could turn my phone face down for it to work but since I have a case it doesn’t work.,5,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0

Do not buy. I purchased excited to try this charger. I have iPhone XR max. Clear iPhone cover. Did not work with cover so tried without. It fully charged a few nights.

"We were hesitant because we have Samsung S6 Edge and S6 Edge + phones and were not sure if this was compatible, but sure enough it works exactly as expected.

This is a really good charging pad for the price and fast charges my iPhone 11 Pro Max like its on a regular charger. So simple to just set down beside my bed when I’m sleeping and forget about it. I like the design of this charging pad as well it’s not too small but also not too bulky and large so you can make a lot of space for it anywhere. Really recommend for anyone looking for a charging pad instead of a normal charging cord and is finished with cords breaking when you need them most.

Meh. It doesn’t seem to charge very quickly or fully. When you put your phone on and it “connects” you get a green light. If the “connection” is interrupted the green light blinks - often times it takes several tries for the phone to stay connected and sometimes in the middle of the night it disconnects and stops charging. More trouble than it’s worth.,2,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0

I recently got a new phone and I was tired of having to buy countless chargers because the wire would always bend which made the charger no longer work. Once I switched to wireless the game changed for me!

I also enjoy not worrying about having a charging cord damage my battery portal on my phone. Also did I mention that this charging pad is a GREAT price?! How could you not order one,5,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
Bought this for my office desk and love it. Plug and play simplicity. I have an iPhone and this chargers it very quickly. Being able to put down then later pick up the phone is so easy. Not sure I would recommend for travel just because of size but I like my chargers to fit in a backpack pocket.,5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
it was a good weight to hold my trash can down.,1,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"First of all I just want to say the most important thing, the charger works. And I wasn't sure about that when I bought it. It is fairly cheap so I had my suspicions. When it came, I plugged it in, put my phone (iPhone 8) on it and it immediately started to charge my phone.For a faster charging you need a plug that holds 2.1V and above, I used the iPhone plug and it charges, but not as quick as I would want.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"Just what I wanted. Can't speak for charge speed, but as an overnight trickle charger, and for a quick and easy top off when I'm gonna leave my phone laying around anyways, it's an excellent little wireless charger for the money.Comes with both a type-c to type-c cable, and a type-c to type-b cable. And the light only stays on for the first few seconds of laying it down which is a plus.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"I used to try to remember my charger or I would snag one from someone else in the office.  Now, I just have it always plugged in and when I need it, I just rest my phone on it.  Easy!",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"No complaints. It does what it's designed to do. I leave it on the side table next to the couch and lay my phone on it when I'm not using it, and it does a good job of charging.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
This product charges my iPhone XS perfectly! Easy to use and take anywhere. It charges right through my case and I don’t have to worry about extra wires. Highly recommend. Very pleased the product works as described.,5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"The charger is well made.  Power cord fits securely in the base.  Initial lighting of the ring let's you know it's on and ready.  Upon placing my Note 8 on the base, charging started immediately.  The phone recognized it as a fast charger.  That was amazing.  Tested with small thin cases and charged fine.  Only issue was when using a thicker wallet style case on the phone, it had difficulty charging. It would recognize initially,  but then lose connection. Removing my phone from the case and placing on the base, and charging was perfect.In all, it is a well made charger that meets the expectations at an amazing price.",5,1,2018-12-24,1,0,0
This is very easy to use all you have to do is put your phone on top of it and it will charge. I loved it for the first two weeks and after that it stopped working all together. Pretty disappointed that it quit working so shortly after. Did enjoy it while it worked.,1,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
This charger is super convenient and works really well. My phone is a little tricky with its case on but it does still work if I don't touch it at all. If you have a thin case you should have no problems at all. It works really well with my wireless headphones as well.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"I like this little thing, it’s sleek and does what it’s supposed to. But I am knocking it a star because it takes forever to charge the battery of my phone, which is huge and takes a while to charge as it is. I’d recommend so you can use the lightning port for earbuds while it charges, but not for if you’re in a huge hurry to go anywhere with low battery. You’ll be waiting a while. Useful, but could be better.",4,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"I admit I was skeptical about moving from a wire charger to this wireless one but what a great decision. I use it every night and it charges my phone , a Samsung 7 , easily just by placing it on the yootech. I highly recommend it to anyone with a wireless charger capable phone.",5,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
I really was skeptical about the product at first since I was expecting a slow charge. It works fast (when you plug it into the wall). I’m really a fan now and suggesting it to others. I use it on my nightstand at night. I have no issues with connecting. Good quality. Easy to use.,5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
"There wasn't anything I didn't like, I was hoping it would charge as quickly as my fast cable charger, but I'm told that the wireless chargers can't. I've tried more expensive wireless chargers, and they didn't work any better than this one.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
Charges well but has to be perfectly centered on charger. Gets annoying. I can’t just place my phone down quickly I have to wait to make sure it’s placed correctly and starts to charge.,3,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"This is my first venture into wireless charging, as I just got my iPhone X with that charging feature. I noticed that it charged faster than another manufacturer's charger that I first bought. I am very happy with this model. Yootech is a solid company, and my usual go to company for my cellular needs. They are very well made products and they stand behind their products. They have a super support team, and all backed by a warranty. They also followed up the purchase with an email with tips about using this product, that was not addressed in the instruction manual.",5,1,2019-5-16,1,0,0
Upgraded to a new phone that supported wireless charging. The price was reasonable so I decided to give it a try. Used it to recharge my phone overnight.  Very convenient to just lay the phone on the charger as I'm going to bed.  Haven't taken it with me while travelling but may do so in the future.  Have  had a couple of times when I didn't place it properly but that had more to do with my case than the charger.  As long as it's properly seat I wake up to a fully charged phone.  Overall I've been happy with my purchase,4,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
"It’s great for charging but there is no way to turn off the massive blinking light that happens for 15 seconds once the phone is charged. Incredibly annoying in the middle of the night when the disc looks like a UFO taking off. This is a major mistake on the part of the company. It’s a great charger, but NOT for your nightstand...",1,1,2019-8-23,1,1,0
I had a pedestal style charger but I decided when I had a problem with it to try this one. This one is easier to place your phone on. Not a big deal but just a hair more convenient.,5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
This wireless charger charges my iPhone 8 really fast with my Spigen case on it. Easy to use and charges immediately after I place the phone on it. I’ve been using it for the last week and I highly recommend it.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1
"Only used with 5V, 2A. Charges about normal speed (5V, 1A wired charger). Have not tried fast charger with this product. Sleek and very nice light dimming feature for going to sleep at night.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,1,0
"I ordered this charger as a replacement for an Anker wireless charger which failed after a couple of months.  I had never heard of Yootech, but I thought I would give them a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The build quality is excellent and it works well with my phone.",5,1,2019-1-24,1,0,0
"Good for starting Wireless charging, sometimes is iffy as to whether it wants to charge my device, and (it may just be my phone) it's pretty precise as to where it wants the device when trying to charge, I've found over the Apple Logo is the most consistant spot",4,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0
LOVE this charger and will be buying more for other rooms soon. It’s so nice to not have to deal with cords anymore. With this charger you can grab your phone quickly to do something without unplugging or risking tearing up the charger and then just as quickly set it down to charge again. It’s extremely reliable as well.,5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
"I've only been using the charger for the past few days with my iPhone XS which is in a case, and it's a pretty good experience so far - I just put my iPhone on the circle (it has to be almost perfectly centered though) and a green light will turn on for 1-2 seconds indicating that my iPhone is charging (and that it detects a device)",5,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
I’ve had this charger for 3 months and have been very satisfied. I’m using an iPhone XR with an outbox symmetry case. I use the charger every night. It is my first time with a wireless charger and I love it. So much more convenient than plugging in the phone every night. The quality of this unit is very good. It is cool that the light flashes when you set the phone on it to confirm it is charging. The light turns off shortly after. I didn’t buy any wxtra adapters and used my normal iPhone usb block that cam with the phone.,5,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
This product did not live up to my expectations my phone gets exceedingly hot I will wake up in the morning and it will still be at 40% I have to take off the cover to put it on the charger. I do not recommend this.,2,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

"Wireless chargers really save your butt sometimes. It's nice not to have to worry about plugging a phone in, and this one features Fast Charging on most phones which is super convenient as well. The only downside is that this one smells significantly like rubber, and that makes it much worse when the phone gets hot from charging.",4,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
I have been wanting a wireless charger since I purchased the Samsung S9 about a year ago. I was hesitant to spend the high dollar on the name brand wireless charger and decided I would give this charger a chance. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this charger because it does everything I need and would expect from a wireless charger. It may not be as quick as the wired option but is very convenient to keep on your nightstand and use over night.,5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
Seems like magic. Works well as it says in the instructions.  I just place it on the dock and it instantly starts charging as promised. My wife wishes it would change colors when it's done charging  but I'm fine with the way it is. Great product at a affordable price!,5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"This works great. I have an iPhone 8. The only drawback is that depending on what case you have your phone in, it won’t always charge. Mine works fine, but others in my family have heavier cases and those won’t charge on this while in their cases. I don’t really think that issue is the fault of the product at all, but something to consider when purchasing.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
"This charger does not work for my IPHONE XR, I gave it to my son who  has an IPHONE 8, also does not work for his phone. We tried it on a galaxy phone & surprise didn’t work. I’m not sure what phones this is really intended for.",1,1,2019-4-14,1,1,0
"Make sure that when you place this on the charger, you do so with a bit of force.  the charger wont kick on until it is tapped hard enough that the green light comes on.  When i first purchased this, I tried setting this thing on there 'softly' for 15 minutes and never got it to charge.  Other than that, it's great.",5,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
"This product is great and well worth every dollar! The charger is a low cost product, which usually I am skeptical of, however, this wireless charger is fantastic and has yet to let me down. It charges fast, is small enough to place somewhere unnoticeable, and works on many of the wireless cellphones out there (In my case, I use the iPhone XS Max)! I highly recommend this product and look forward to investing in another one soon!",5,1,2018-12-23,1,1,0
"This charger came packed nicely, was inexpensive and super easy to setup (just plug it into a USB power plug), and works exactly as expected. Nice fast charging, and the indicator light tells you if the phone is not centered properly by blinking. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it.",5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"I bought an iPhone XR recently and figured I'd make use of the wireless charging. No complaints, charges even with case on. I like how the green light will come on when you set down your device to charge and is off when not in use. I would have loved it if the light came in blue because that is my favorite color but green is my second favorite color so I don't mind haha. Good price, sleek, and works.",5,1,2019-1-11,1,0,0
Great item. Charges great! I have one on my nightstand and one in my living room. Just make sure the green light turns on and you see and/or hear the charging sound before you leave it. It needs to be placed in the middle. Fast shipping too. Customer service is awesome!,5,1,2019-1-22,1,0,0

I like this a lot and keep it on side table beside my chair where I sit the most. My only complaint is sometimes I have to pick my phone back up and place it back down a little readjusted to get it to atm tart charging,5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I love this charger. Works great and I’ve bought 5 more Yootech chargers! This one has a ring with a green light as it charges, this one is better for any room except my bedroom because of the light, but is handy to know you have placed it correctly. Love it.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"I like the concept of it, it charges slow though. And it doesn't continuously charge. Seems like I need to move my phone once in a while so it would charge again.Unfortunately, I threw away the box it came in and took too long to return. There's no guarantee I would have received full refund without the box.",2,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
"It's ok, nothing special. Charges slower than being directly plugged in for fast charging. It works fine but sometimes with thicker cases, you have to shift it around a little. Happy with it but it's not great.",3,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
Please dont waste your money and time on this product. This product doesn't work.. atleast for me...  I use Samsung S9 and my Husband iPhone X. I liked the idea of having just one charger for both the device. I was initially excited about the product. but unfortunately dint turn out to be value for money item. it took 3+hrs to get S9 fully chagerd and after a month use it died. Highly disappointed. I would not recommand this item.,1,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0

"I like that it's very easy to use this charger and it's convenient for my phone because the usual plugging/unplugging usually causes the charging slot to break. Convenient size to carry in my purse.

Good product, I recommend it.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0

"Very easy to use, plug it in, set your phone down, and watch it work. It definitely charges my iPhone XR faster than the normal wall outlet.

Will probably buy more of them to set around the house.",5,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
The charger was very easy to set up. I use it for my Bluetooth earbuds Which have a base that stores charge. Now I don’t have to plug in the base every night. Charged very quickly. I’m very satisfied with this purchase.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1

So easy to use, love that it lights up to tell you when it’s “connected” but the light turns off shortly after so it doesn’t disturb you when you’re sleeping.

I haven’t gotten to use the fast charge feature yet because I have an iPhone 8 Plus but can’t wait to when Apple begins implementing that technology in their phones.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

That's a real plus for me.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,1

We love our Yootech wireless charger so much that we ordered another after receiving  the first yootech charger which is made very well. My husband has one set up on his night stand and I have one in the living room and our phones never run out of charge when we are home. We effortlessly set it down which has become a habit and our dead battery phone problems have disapeared.  I especially appreciate the light dissapearing so it doesn't disturb sleep when by your bed. Excellent design! When you use and depend on your phone like us this is life changing. This is a great practical gift idea!,5,1,2018-12-15,1,0,1
"This wireless charger is nothing super special, I lay my phone on it and it charges it, I like the fact that the light does not stay on while the phone is charging.

"These chargers have been great for me.  I keep it plugged in by my desk so it’s easy to keep my phone charged at work.  These work so well that I bought a couple for my kids to keep by their beds.  An indicator light lets you know the phone is charging, but it shuts off after several seconds.  That’s pretty sweet for anyone who is light sensitive and thinking about getting this to keep on your night stand.

This thing is Awesome for my Iphone XR. Charge super fast not to picky where you have to pplace your phone on it to charge. Just as long as you over the battery. Does charge better and fast if directly under it though. Definitely buy another one. Recommend buying,5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

I love this product and it actually charges faster than my charging cable. Plug it in and set my iPhone on and it bam! It’s charging. I loved it so much I bought my daughter one for her phone as well. It makes it SO easy to charge my phone while still using my headphones to listen to music or my audio books. I have it at my desk at work and even my coworkers come over and ask to use it to charge their Samsung/android phones.

"It works, is small, and has a nice grippy rubber. For the cost it can't be beat. Despite this the plastic has an AWFUL smell. The moment I opened the package it was noticeable.

It works very well. I've never used a wireless charger so I was happy that this one proved to work as intended. While charging my phone I leave the case on so its heated up a bit while charging but nothing dangerous or extreme. The only downside I think is that even though it says that it is fast charging it doesn't charge as fast as it does with the original charger.For reference I have a Samsung Galaxy S10.,4,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"The charger I received has a knockoff feel to it.My phone has to be in a specific spot on the charger pad; if you move the phone at all it will slow down or stop charging.

I ordered this product because I wanted a wireless charger for my nightstand. I love that I can just set my phone on it and am not impaired by wires when I want to look at my phone again. No messing with connectors when it’s dark to try to plug in either. The led light lets me know it’s charging then it turns off again so the light doesn’t bother your sleep.  I ended up ordering more for my husband and son! Great product! I use it for my iPhone and AirPods!,5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,1
My phone gets really warm when using the charger but so far I am pleased with it. I recently am working from home so it’s good to have another charger in the room where I spend most of my time  during the day.

I gave it a couple other chances and it looked like it was charging then stop charging out of nowhere. i did not do anything different. better off getting an apple one.,1,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0

I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S10+ and wanted a 10w wireless charger that was it too expensive for my nightstand. The Yootech fit the bill.

I bought this when I upgraded to the iPhone 11. I like how there is a slight rubber-ish edge around it to keep the phone from sliding.

I bought two of these for myself and my wife’s new iPhones. Mine seems to work perfectly all the time but hers seems to loose connection to the power socket every so often. She has to unplug it from the wall and plug it back in. Not a huge drama when you realise it’s jot charging but if you don’t realise you’ll leave your phone on charge over night and it will be dead in the morning. Maybe it’s the USB plug she is using - maybe if it shipped with its own one we’d know that one should work.,4,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0

If you're charging your phone overnight, then it's no big deal, but if you need to get your phone charged quickly, I would stick to a typical lightning cable instead.",4,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

Product is easy to use. Wireless charger. No brainer. But I hate we missed the “return by” date because in the middle of the night it tries to connect repeatedly for no reason. It’s the noise it makes when you initially lay it down. But it’s 10+ consecutive beeps. Super annoying. Makes you wonder if it could effect the phone long term. My mistake that I missed the return by date. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS WIRELESS CHARGER!,2,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

I purchased this wireless charger to go with my Note 8 and it works extremely well. The green light that circles it shuts off after a few seconds after putting the phone on so it won't disturb you while you are sleeping. The only thing I would improve is charging speed.

It charges pretty fast and is great for traveling. I’m so happy with it I’m going to get them for both my kids for their birthdays.

Product is as advertised. Charges the phone quickly and through my charger. doesn't get the phone hot or anything. I haven't had a single issue with it.

I really like this product. I was excited to use a wireless charger because I’m afraid of damaging my actual charging port. The directions are pretty simple and to be honest not necessarily needed.

I was skeptical since the price was low but I've been so happy with it. It charges pretty quickly and the charge lasts me all day with normal use.

Sleek and convenient! I like that it had a grip ring to avoid your device falling if u bump into it or something. Clear light indicators when it registers a device to begin charging. The chord sits at the perfect length so that you don’t have too much extra. If you plan on storing this in anything higher than say 3 feet u may want to use a longer USB chord. I personally love that it’s not too long.,5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,1

Don't think this is really a design issue but it is a customer experience factor.,4,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0

"Works great, it’s very slim and low profile doesn’t take up much room on my desk.

"This thing is amazing fast, highly recommend!!! I ordered this after getting a case for my new IPhone XS Max and seeing a recommendation for this wireless charger.

This wireless charger works great with my Note 9. It charges well for a wireless charger. It comes with an extra charging cord which I appreciate because I have a tendency to lose or bust cords. It is also great in my bedroom because it does not have an obnoxious light that stays on. It only lights up for a few seconds to let you know you are connected and again that you are at full charge. It is light weight and not bulky to carry around.,5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0

I was skeptical at first because the price was right around 12 dollars. I had bought a few wireless chargers before 7 to 25 dollar range and they didn't seem to last or there was just problems with them. I bought it thinking I try it out. When it arrived  right away l ilke the feel of it wasn't heavy but there was some weight to it. It wasn't light plastic like so many are.

Very capable unit for the price. The charger is low profile and sleek. Includes a USB type C to USB type C cable as well as a USB type C to USB A cable for support of older chargers.

This product is very lightweight and easy to use. I use it as my desk charger at work. The only reason why I am rating this a 4 - and I dont think it is the product's fault - is because I usually have to remove my otterbox phone case to get maximum charge.

But for regular charging is very convenient to place it down on the disc and charging begins. No problems but most of off no more cords. Would definitely buy again and did.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0

I bought this charger really only for charging my phone at night because with charging on a wireless pad saves your battery. Once it charges your battery to 100% it stops charging where as with a chord charger it charges until you unplug it and that can be bad on the battery (it will slowly weaken it over time) if you are charging your phone while you sleep. So far I have no problem with this wireless charger!,5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

Works as expected. The only tricky thing is that it requires a large charger to operate.

I bought this for my wife but ordered another for myself the same day I received it. I highly recommend this charger.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0

"An inexpensive wireless charger.  You need the wall plug thing of course, but who doesn't have a ton of those lying around from every cell phone you've ever bought.  It lights up for a few seconds when you put the phone on to confirm it is charging.  I use it to charge the iPhone 8.  Not as fast a charge as plugging in, but that is to be expected.",5,1,2019-8-15,1,0,0

This charger is fast and charges my phone reliably each time I use it so I don’t have to worry about waking up to a dead phone. My favorite feature is the green light that flashes to confirm proper placement of your phone on the charger. I also can charge my phone without removing it from the case! The black color makes it a sleek addition to my nightstand.,5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"Very straightforward to use. Just plug it in and put your phone on top. It works with all of the Qi wireless charging compatible devices I have. Compared to my other wireless chargers, I enjoy the fact that the light isn’t obstructive in the evenings as some of my other wireless chargers. The charging speed is also very nice.",5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
This item is great when installed next to my bed.  I just have to place it on it to get charged instead of playing around with cable and try to plug my phone in.  This is a lazy person's best answer.,5,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0

Can’t say enough about this charger. This charger does exactly what they stayed it will. It is so easy to use.  Just set your phone down and it starts charging. Even through the case. I love the nighttime feature on it. After 16 seconds the light goes out completely and this is the best feature because I use the strong charger in my bedroom. I can’t stand the chargers with those obnoxious LED lights that keep you up at night.,5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0

"I ordered two of these. They are great.  I got one for my home and one for my office.  Super easy to understand, just plug it into a USB and it charges.

"I take my charger everywhere!!!  Camping, to motels and of course right next to me at night on my nightstand.

I will be buying more for my family.",5,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0

I purchased this a while ago and it’s been working beautifully to charge my iPhone XR every nigh. I love the green light to let me know it’s charging (it goes out a few seconds later so it won’t intrude on sleep or anything).Don’t forget to purchase a QC plug to take advantage of the high speed charging. My phone goes up almost halfway in less than 30 mins!,5,1,2019-4-17,1,0,1
Seems like it works pretty well to me. Have it connected to my IMAC to charge my IPHONE SE2(2020 model) and so far no complaints. Ill come back an update of course after 30 days but so far 10/10 for me,5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
