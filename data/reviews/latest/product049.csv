"Without the August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge automation tools that are described in the ""Works With"" Menu of the app cannot fully function. I think it's useful for:1) Airbnb - because my guests get lock codes instantly (hence: instant book with instant check-ins).",4,1,2019-7-23,1,2,0
"It works, but as others have said... Not well. I had read about the connectivity issues but hoped they had been fixed.They haven't... Even though my router is in a line of sight to the connect and it's only 15-20 feet away, the connect could not find it.",2,1,2017-8-9,1,1,1
"I love my August locks and really wish that my HomeKit Hub would have been sufficient to keep my locks synced but as hard as I tried, there was no way around buying the bridge to ensure out of home operation. It is VERY disappointing that you have to have a bridge for each lock and it is disappointing that it must be so close to each lock. Yes, these points are made clear by August up front. It would seem like they could do a better job with it. Besides, at some point I will have zero outlets left in the house. I do not like the fact that it required the bridge to link to both my Google Home devices and to my Alexa devices. I do not like the fact that you must use a verbal code to unlock the door with either Google or Alexa — especially since anyone in earshot will hear it and that, in itself, provides multiple security risks. I am beyond disappointed that after spending $75 for what at most should be a $50 item I learn after several long phone calls to customer service to learn that the integration between August and Google & Alexa “isn’t quite working just yet”. I had and still have high hopes for August. They just need to step up very quickly!",1,1,2018-12-27,1,3,0
"This device is almost impossible to easily add to your Wifi network and the app does not make it very easy. Took at least an hour of constant attempts before it finally worked. Bluetooth connection to the lock was very flaky even though it was literally 1.3 feet away. However, I had this device connected for several months and then suddenly it stopped working. I reset the device and wasted hours trying to get it to re-pair to the network. Nothing worked... endless fast green light flashing indicating it couldn't connect.Then the real nightmare started which was my interaction with ""customer service"". I quickly learned they have a simple strategy - do everything possible not to respond in real-time and ignore whatever the customer tells you in order to make the customer go away. Seriously, after describing the problem and the fact that I've gone through all of the troubleshooting, all I got back were emails outlining the trouble shooting steps. When I insisted on them honoring the warranty I got some nonsense back about being out of the 30 day RMA window for refund. After two more emails requesting them to honor the warranty, I got back the same email about needing to follow the troubleshooting steps.",1,1,2020-7-8,1,1,0
"I use this product for my rental properties on Airbnb and it's very useful to be able to open up the door for guests remotely when they can't.  I'd say about 80% of guests don't have any problem setting up the app on their phone, and they find the whole thing innovative and neat.  They can use their cell phone to open the door.I like that I can see who locks and unlocks the door and at what time on the August app.",3,1,2020-5-12,1,2,0
"Lock and Connect packages arrived an hour ago. Although there were thumb-holes in the packaging, for both lock and connect, I had to tear the packaging completely apart to get to the items - and I have very strong hands & fingers!  Once out of the package, the lock set-up was intuitive (ie, I didn't read the directions).  Then I downloaded the app, and set up the lock - pretty easy, except I don't like having to put my picture into their database for ""security"".  There was a little fussing to enter the security code they sent, because sometimes it would send to my phone, other times to email. Once I read carefully to which device the code was being sent, the system took the code.  Then I set up the connect, ie the wifi bridge.  Set-up was easy, but the connect is 6' 3"" from the lock, and claims to have a bad Bluetooth connection.  The connect is not USB powered, it just plugs into an outlet, and I though I was fortunate to have an outlet 6+ feet from the lock.  But apparently one should have the connect much closer to the lock, so I may run an extension cord.  Crappy Bluetooth, in my opinion.  Nonethelss, the lock works from my phone using the August app when I stand a block away.  But so far, even though August and Alexa are supposedly linked, Alexa won't lock/unlock the door.  More later if/when I can get Alexa to work August.  Update 2 hrs later: lock now works with Alexa app (not sure why it suddenly started to work; maybe it just takes a while for everything to sync), but not so far with Alexa voice control. Update a day later:  Turns out I was asking Alexa to ask August to lock the door, per instructions.  However, by accident I found that it works by voice just by asking Alexa to lock the door - trying to get Alexa to ask August to do something does not work.  So much for instructions.  And as others pointed out, the doorsense doesn't work with metal-clad doors, since it is a magnet. Still 4 stars.",4,1,2018-11-14,1,2,0
"I mean, if you are committed to purchasing the August, then buy direct, because they won't warranty what you purchase through Amazon. :(  I had to learn this the hard way unfortunately.  I purchased the lock, connect and doorbell in June 2018.  At no point did any of the components work in unison.  First, the doorbell wouldn't power up.  August said it was our existing doorbells faulty/insufficient power source.  I hired an electrician to upgrade the 18v. wiring - he said it was ridiculous but did the work I requested anyway.  Still doesn't work.  Then, I decided to just use the doorbell camera as a makeshift 'security camera' set up on a table in my house.  Fine.  But, it doesn't even work anymore since I spent more money to upgrade our internet receiver.  It simply won't connect.As far as the lock, I had to have a new piece sent out and finally got it to work with the August Connect.  It worked from August - December and then we had a wind storm and the August Connect for some reason couldn't pick up the internet signal.  Like I said, shortly thereafter I upgraded and got the very best internet modem and package through Comcast because I really needed these three components to work simultaneously.  Well, the lock and connect are now working together.",1,1,2019-2-19,1,3,0
"The design and the concept is solid but the execution is poor. When installing this, like many have said, the Connect cannot find the August lock even though it is merely 5 feet away from my front door. Nevertheless, I’ve somehow managed to get this device to work. Interestingly, the device kept dropping its connection with the lock (I would get multiple notifications throughout the day with an arbitrary amount of downtime). Frustrating! Then all of the sudden after owning this for about 2-3 weeks, the connection has remained solid. When it works, it is brilliant. When it doesn’t, it is madly frustrating. Like many have said, this thing is need of a (many actually) serious firmware update. C’mon August folks, you guys need to stand by your products and give ongoing support. If you cannot do that, than the products should be discontinued.An expensive purchase for something unreliable. I would not recommend this product and suggest looking elsewhere for smart locks. Since I live in a condo with HOA that expects no changes to the outside, I was only limited to smart locks that kept your existing hardware. If it weren’t for that, I would have must definitely returned this.",2,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"I bought the August smart lock and it was awesome, I loved it. So I bought this item to connect to HomeKit and my security system. It worked great for about a week. Ever since, it’s constantly dropping WiFi and losing connection. I’ve factory defaulted both the connect and the lock around 5 times and same issues. It’s located 5 feet from my modem, 2 feet from a mesh WiFi device, and 2 feet from the actual lock. I even set up a separate 2.4ghz network JUST for the connect. No changes. This product needs software and firmware updates. I hope they update it soon or it’s going on eBay.Update 5/25/18",2,1,2018-5-19,1,3,0
"This company is going backwards... I used to be able to open my door remotely with only the August lock an the app, therefore I didnt really understood why this Connect thing existed but the past few months I wasnt able to unlock/unlock remotely with only the app and I thougth that maybe they just changed the software so that you would have to be froced to buy this which I did... Installing it was a problem since it only supports 2.4 and I had my phone at a 5Ghz network so after realizing that I had a few problems but was able to connect it an get it working... Now, first day out of my house and the thing will simply not connect... It just says ""brigde unavailable"" really dissapointed with this company...",1,1,2017-7-14,1,5,0
"I know some people have left good and bad references but I love this thing. I wish they had this when my kids were little. Having it unlock the door as I walk up to it is key. No turned on the auto lock as well not sure if that's as good as I have to be careful to always bring my keys or phone so I don't get locked out but when I forget to lock the house when I leave for work makes me wonder how often I used to leave my house unlocked by accident.  I also have a roav vnfornalexa in my car so can lock it by voice. From my car or unlock it with voice or phone so the kids can run back in. Like when we forget stuff.  If you have a busy life  this is key.  The bridge  I think should be part of the lock  it use my wink hub which it doesn't but an August lock is just the bomb. I even made it part of my "" goodnight "". If then routine. So when I'm in bed I just tell Alexa goodnight and she shuts off the lights and locks the door.  I even could give a friend a guest invite so she could let herself in",5,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
What a thorough disappointment.An eco system with such promise - but just falls incredibly short.,1,1,2016-7-7,1,2,0
"After installing the August app and adding the Wi-Fi bridge to my network it was running smoothly. However I noticed after 1 week + of use, the bridge had a red light indicating that it was not connected. There was an issue with my internet router and after resetting it I had to re-connect the bridge. There lies the slight issue I have with it.The distance in order for the bridge and lock to work is very fickle to say the least. The bridge has to be very near to communicate with the lock however if a user does not have an outlet near their door then it's 50/50 if the 2 will communicate at all.",4,1,2018-8-6,1,2,0
"I tried it for a year and just can't deal with it anymore. It's nice when it works, but that's only 20% of the time. I have the August Connect Wi-Fi bridge less than 7 feet from the door. When it works, it is unlocking the door from the driveway. Unfortunately, the frustration of expecting it to work when I'm in a hurry or have my hands full and it not working is too much. The lock itself is much bulkier than expected. It looks out of place and when you have to lock/unlock it manually, the magnetic cover falls off in your hand. During the year, I did get one email from August asking for feedback. I gave the same feedback to them and got nothing in response other than ""thank you for completing the survey"". Still worked like junk after a few updates.",1,1,2019-11-18,1,1,0
"I have been using this August bridge to add WiFi capability to my August smart lock. My current lock does not support remote lock and unlock without the use of this bridge. If you install an August smart lock without native WiFi support, you can only unlock using Bluetooth while in the vicinity of the device. Keep in mind that this bridge does not add Apple HomeKit support. You are stuck using the August app to access lock features. It does have Auto-Unlock but this works by using Bluetooth.I would recommend this anyone BUT if you are an Apple user, I would recommend spending the extra money to add an August smart lock with native HomeKit support.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,1,0
"I bought the August Gen 3 Smart lock with the WiFi bridge, I have to say I love it.  Some recommendations for smooth install and dependable use.  Use Loctite and don’t over tighten mounting screws to deadbolt assembly; make sure tailpiece of deadbolt assembly is perfectly aligned with August lock; apply generous amount of heavy machine grease to moving components; make sure bolt is aligned to bolt face plate, weather striping can offset alignment (Dremmel tool would be handy to make perfect fit).  I did all this with mine, and it works perfectly.  I love the home/away function on the app; I just walk up to my door and it automatically unlocks for me; very useful when my hands are full.  Also, being able to check to see if the door is locked when I’m away from home.  Another perk is being able to check the history of when my door has been opened/closed, locked/unlocked (great for apartment maintenance, or forgetful girlfriend who occasionally leaves door unlocked).  Definitely grants peace of mind!  If your are not the handy type, I would recommend hiring someone to do the install for smooth operation.",5,1,2018-6-23,1,2,0
"To keep this short and simple I will say that the August Bridge is a must for the lock. That being said, it took quite a while to connect as there is a few flaws in the app during setup.It took me over an hour to get this connected. I had to do my own troubleshooting and discovered that when it's trying to connect with Wi-Fi I had to manually turn off and on the Wi-Fi on my phone. Once I did that, it finally worked.",4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
This thing will not stay working. When it does work it is great. The problem is that it keeps loosing bluetooth. Every day when I check my bluetooth signal strength it says Poor. I reset the devices and the bluetooth signal says good. You have to do this everyday. I contacted August. You might as well contact a monkey at the zoo. They refuse to accept any responsibility for anything. As I told them a 12 year old with a Raspberry Pi can figure out bluetooth. But it seems these people can not. Do not buy this Dumb Lock!!!!,1,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"I have ORBI WIFI, so my WIFI is strong everywhere in my home.My issue with this WIFI connect is that it ONLY does one LOCK, even if you have two locks close to each other.  (this is why the 3 stars)",3,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
"Item works as needed. Despite being 4 feet from the lock, the reported signal level (Bluetooth) bounces up and down (most of time the August app rates the Bluetooth signal as poor) although this doesn’t seem to effect it’s functionality.Update (5/9/13): I moved my connect so that is direct line of sight with the smart lock 30 feet away). Signal strength has gone up to excellent from low (when it was 4 feet away with a stucco wall in between). The connect is now plugged into a ups along with cable modem/router so theoretically it will even work during outages.",4,1,2019-3-11,1,1,0
"I bought these locks to allow for my home to be locked when away and yet to automatically unlock when family members came home. I purchased two locks (front and back doors) and one Bridge Connect  unit for wi-fi remote access, then found out during installation that a Bridge Connect unit is needed for each Lock in order to access wi-fi remote options, an added unexpected expense. The literature hypes the Auto Lock and Auto Unlock options of the locks. However, there is no mention that these options can only be used on one lock per home. Auto Lock only operates on a timer, locking the door at a specified time after the door is closed, just leaving home does NOT lock the doors. Auto Unlock is designed to unlock the door when you return - however it can only operate on one lock per home. If Auto Lock is enabled for the Front Door you cannot enter through the Back Door without using a key or opening the app, selecting the door and unlocking.  Although the Locks do work, the lack of integration of the locks and the limitations of the Connect unit make their usefulness extremely limited. I would strongly recommend you do detailed research on the capabilities/limitations of any wi-fi lock system before buying - this one fell far short of expectations.",2,1,2019-6-3,1,1,0
"While many people have complained about the lack of range and the ability to support only 1 lock at a time, I will offer reasons why this is so.  The locks themselves are designed to have a shorter range for 2 reasons: security and battery life.  Limiting the bluetooth range to 5-10 feet means that someone has to be at your door to access the lock, instead of being able to access it from down the street.  That also means that the Wi-Fi bridge can only be about 5 feet away from the lock in order for it to work properly.  Since most entryway doors are further than 5 feet apart, it means that it can only connect to one of them.  Keeping the range low also allows the batteries to last longer.Setup was fairly easy, although I wasn't too happy with where I had to end up placing the adapter, but it's not the end of the world. Anyone with a home built since 2005 should have an outlet close enough to their door that they shouldn't have to worry about the range issue.  Functionality works well, and Alexa integration was smooth.  It seems that many of the gripes that people had are due to the design of the lock, so do some evaluation beforehand and you should be alright.",4,1,2018-10-29,1,0,0
I purchased the August Smart Lock along with the August Connect WiFi Bridge a few years ago to be used on a vacation rental home to help with check in and key handovers.The best things about this lock is the sleek look and ease of installation.,2,1,2019-4-4,1,0,0
"Really good product that works with the August deadbolt.  I bought the deadbolt from another place and found out that I needed connect to lock it with my phone so I found it on Amazon  cheaper than the August site.  Suggestion buy both the deadbolt and connect together from Amazon for about $159.  Now with both I can unlock my door while I'm away from home.  I can allow people to get in by inviting them to download and use the App.  Get this, the door unlocks when I approach my door and locks automatically when it shuts.  And most importantly I can still use my key to open the door!!  Awesome!",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"So this was the last piece to my smart home. I have a Harmony Hub and it said it works with my August Smart Lock.. the part they left out was that it works with other hubs of you have the connect. It was easy to get setup so I focus on what I liked about it and this review. I thought it was unnecessary, and shouldn't require a connect module for it to work with other hubs/Google/Alexa. Either way, connecting it was a breeze. It does have to be in vicinity of the August Smart Lock otherwise it won't be able to lock the door. Luckily, I have an outlet on an Uninterrupted Power Supply I bought that is close to my front door. I would've used an outlet, but i didn't want to run the risk of someone unplugging it from the outlet to charge a phone or something and then I'd be unable to control the door lock remotely. So plugging it into the UPS solved that problem for me. It works reliably about 99% of the time. It didn't work once, and that was because my internet connection had been reset. Other than that it works extremely reliably. I had a Home Chef delivery sent to me when I wasn't home and was able to call my neighbor and let him into my place to put the food away for me before I arrived home. It worked flawlessly. I saw some older reviews, and I think they've updated the software on the connect to the point where it is now very reliable, as those folks had lots of problems, but i think the updates fixed those issues.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"I have a serious issue with the August system, and I'm hoping that future firmware updates will fix it... its slow. You'd think that someone would think ""Hey, let's cache the last state the August lock was in that was sent to the Wi-Fi bridge, so if you look it up on the phone, it would be instantanous."" However, this is not the case. Not by a long shot. The Pixel 2 XL has some odd issues with Bluetooth making it impossible to connect to the August lock, so I rely on the Wifi connectivity to make sure I can unlock the door when I need it. However, it takes 10 seconds for it to wake up the device (despite it requiring a wall connection), then 10 seconds to connect to the lock, and then finally it sends a command.There's some good stuff going on with August, but their software needs to be improved, significantly.",3,1,2017-12-29,1,1,0
"Bought in August 2018.  Connected initially, but have had constant issues since.  Used to be once a month or week it would notify me it was offline or I would try to use the lock remotely and it wouldn't work.  The last several months has been offline more than on.  I have a mesh WiFI system that is great.  I have a mesh satellite about 20 ft from the bridge and the bridge is about 10 feet from the lock.  All ideal.  Still... major connection issues.  All troubleshooting has done in the past is have me reboot and reconnect and when it works again, thats it.  Only to have it not work days later.  Maybe they have issues with mesh networks, but man its 2020, you should have a device that works with them as that is the future of wifi and has been around for years....  awful for a product you shell out $300 total for with the bridge to not even be able to use correctly.",1,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I bought two of these; because, we can't control two locks with one of them.  That's my first major problem with these.  Not being able to control two or more locks is ridiculous.  The second major issue is they are not durable.  Both of them totally failed after being in service for a few months.  I would never buy them again.*** If you have a home hub, (Apple Homekit, Google hub, etc) you don't need the connect at all.  The locks work pretty much flawlessly with Apple Homekit.",2,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0

"This is an essential addition to the August Smart Lock.The installation and setup seem easy enough, however, the hidden tricky part is to find the sweet spot where the Connect can get a solid Wi-Fi signal as well as a good Bluetooth connection to the Smart Lock.",4,1,2016-12-18,1,1,0
It's kind of sad really. My lock worked via Bluetooth without the bridge from anywhere in my house. Even a back corner through 3 walls over 40' away. BUT this bridge wouldn't pair with the lock from less than 10' away with only an open archway between them (see the picture I posted). And the bridge shouldn't be limited to a low power battery-saving mode like the lock is.PRO TIP: Use an extension cord for the bridge (or move the lock) so that they are only about a foot away from each other during pairing. Then put everything where you actually want it and cross your fingers.,2,1,2019-8-14,1,0,1
"After reading the horror stories, I was tentative about buying this with my August Lock but I'm glad I did.  After all, what good is a 'smart lock' in a 'smart home' if it isn't internet connected and you can only use it thru Bluetooth Low Energy from 5 feet or so?The Good:",4,1,2017-9-11,1,0,0
"First, I noticed the box I received had been opened and did not contain the setup instructions. I was, however, able to find the manual on the web without an issue.The first time I plugged it into a socket about 3' from the August lock itself and about 15' from my router, it immediately started blinking fast red. I unplugged it and plugged it back in several times without a change in status. I restarted my home wireless router and tried again with no changes. I discovered a button on front of the Connect and pushed it and held it for about 15 seconds. After doing that, it started blinking slow green and I was able to setup the device without an issue. After activating it, the additional features like auto unlock via GPS location, etc. became available. This button feature was not listed anywhere in the documentation so if you have the fast blinking red issue, give it a try. Another requirement when accessing the lock remotely is you have to press the wireless button from within the app in the upper right hand corner. This will then connect you to the lock and provide you the current status. Locking and unlocking it this way took about 3 seconds each time. Very nicely done!",3,1,2016-2-14,1,1,0
"I really like this lock. I can unlock it from anywhere although the furthest distance I’ve tried was 600 miles. I’ve used it to let the sitter in, housekeeper and family when I’m away.  It’s easy to change the battery.  Make certain you change it or else it will stop working and you’re locked out.  I believe there is a key but I’ve been diligent so not a problem.

"This whole system with the August door lock is SO much better than our previous lock (whose name begins with K). We have had no problems at all with this lock over the 60 days or so that we’ve had it. Our old lock had problems almost from the start. When it finally started to randomly unlock the door, it was time to bite the bullet and replace it with something more reliable. So far, the August system does exactly what it’s supposed to do. It’s a tad expensive, but the security is worth it. The only issue I ran into with the installation was the supplied screws weren’t long enough. A quick trip to the home center solved that issue. No big deal.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"I have a short term rental and used august locks for it. I was expecting an easy integration with airbnb as August claims and I was expecting the product to be reliable. unfortunately the reality turned completely different. Integration has a lots of bugs which are causing massive headaches for me. For e.g. each guest will appear as 3 separate entries in my guest list on the app and August cannot fix it. Few times I changed the guest access to an earlier time than my normal checkin time but the timing on the guest end did not update and the guest could not access the property, had to call me. Support is simply terrible, they ignore the questions, they don't read what is written, they don't do anything to fix their problems and they have zero integrations I could use when renting properties on other channels than airbnb.Lately I started getting troubles with this connect device - without any reasons it started to lose the connection few times per day.

It WILL work remotely but it definitely takes time.

Maybe there is some kind of technical interference due to the construction of our home and how radio wave move though the house... blah blah blah.

"It's cute, and it does establish a connection to my 2nd generation August lock, but it won't connect to my WIFI.I disconnected the lock from my front door and placed the lock, my Galaxy S9 and my 1 day old August Connect within 5 feet of my router and no cigar. The Connect failed to connect to my Linksys EA6900 dual band router and won't make a remote connect to my August lock even though the August app registers it and my lock on it's device list.

"I, like many reviewers, have had my rounds with this wifi-bluetooth bridge. During initial setup the device protested that the bluetooth signal was not good enough anywhere that wasn't the outlet 7ft away straight ahead on the side of my kitchen counter. The tested locations included, an outlet 10 ft away, another 9 ft away hidden in the cabinet above my microwave, and three feet away through a standard wall. I left the device in the counter plug that made it happy for nearly one year. I would get a notification at an arbitrary time that the device had lost wifi connection, sometimes in the middle of the night/day. Not once have I had an issue controlling the lock remotely with this device. It has never disconnected at a time I needed it and always promptly reconnects. Now, I relocated the device to the outlet 9ft away that it didn't like about two weeks ago. I didn't ask if it liked it, I just left it there. No discernible change in function has occurred. The device notifications have been reliable and notified me both times Maintenance opened my apartment mid-day, when I wasn't home, without warning, to change my air-filter.",4,1,2018-11-30,1,0,0
"First, the good...  When it's working it is absolutely amazing.  When connected it does exactly what it says on the tin, I can access and receive updates from the lock from anywhere.  I have found the auto-unlock works better and the ability to use voice commands to tell the door to lock via Alexa (or ask Alexa if the door is locked) is very handy.  By default unlocking via Alexa is disabled, which makes sense.  Someone could otherwise literally shout through the door and tell Alexa to unlock your home.Now, minor issues; if you remotely lock your lock (or unlock it), the status doesn't change on the App for a good long while, even if the log shows it was completed successfully.  There was not good feedback on if the device locked or unlocked and when you can't see or hear the lock that is a bit disconcerting.  I also found the notifications don't always work but they are in the log of the app, I think this is an app issue not a service issue.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"Just wanted to mention my experience with having the August Connect fail entirely, twice. The first time was 13 months after I purchased it. It was completely dead despite being plugged into an APC surge protector and suddenly stopped working one day despite no recent surge.However, August support was great and replaced it free of charge, even though it was a month out of warranty. I connected the replacement to a small UPS I now have near enough to my door. The second one just failed again, though I think it made it about 18 months this time.",2,1,2018-10-10,1,0,0
"Why did I wait so long to buy this?  It’s expensive for what it does and yes, I should have bought the kit which included it.

Signal in identical location as my last one is reading full strength and Alexa voice command works quickly.

"Linking the Connect to my August lock was a painless process that only took a couple of minutes. Initially the app warned me that the connect was too far away from the door and I would likely experience lags when trying to lock and unlock my door, but because that was the closest plug, I gave it a try anyways. Despite the warnings, it has worked instantaneously and flawlessly every single time single I installed it five weeks ago. I'm very happy with my purchase, and definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to add extra functionally to their August lock.",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
"As description says, this will allow you to check in on August door lock when you are outside of bluetooth range.  I think this is essential item to have if you are installing August door lock.  With this, you can check in the status of the door lock and lock/unlock the door anywhere you have wifi or cellular data coverage.  I guess I have been lucky enough to not have any issues with this.  This is located within 3 feet of August door lock and after several months of use, we haven't had any issues.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0

"EDIT: Since writing my original review, the device has begun to work much more consistently, specifically with regard to the auto-unlock function and speed of connection in the app. I can now count on the device to work as intended every time I return home. I've increased my rating to 4 stars (from 3, previously).Could not be set up using my Nexus 5x due to a firmware issue (apparently). Got it set up with a friend's iPhone, and it works well enough most of the time, but typically shows a weak Bluetooth connection to the lock despite being maybe 6' away (which is the closest outlet I have). Additionally, when opening the app, the wifi has to be turned on every time to connect to the device - it would be preferable to maintain a continuous WiFi connection to speed up the process (I'm assuming there's a technical reason for this, but I was a little disappointed). Once connected, it does do a pretty good job of controlling the lock remotely when away, and it will connect to other smart home devices. Does not improve lock connection speed when near the door (for auto-unlock, for instance), which is one of my main gripes with the lock itself.",4,1,2017-8-23,1,1,0
This is necessary for the August smart lock. Bluetooth just isn’t enough unfortunately. Had issues with the Auto Unlock until I got the WiFi unit and that made the lock be able to detect my phone much quicker. Rarely ever do I wait at the door for maybe even 10 seconds before it unlocks. With Bluetooth only it was every single time waiting for it to unlock for 30 seconds atleast,4,1,2020-7-13,1,1,0
"I bought the Smart Lock because I came home to find that my teenager had left for school in the morning without locking the front door! It has worked wonderfully! I connected everyone in the household and set up everyone’s phones to auto-lock (which locks the door whenever someone travels more than 200 meters away). My kids love locking the door with their phones, and I am no longer worried that they might forget. It sends me a notification whenever the door lock is activated.So now, if my teen, who is the last to leave every morning, forgets, Auto-lock will lock it, plus I can activate it remotely from work. It also lets me know when they unlock it and arrive back home from school.",5,1,2018-5-6,1,1,0
"First, this is supposed to seamlessly transition from bluetooth to Wifi.  It's clunky.  Sometimes it takes a while to switch as I approach the door.  Second.... FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS GOOD AND HOLY... WHY DO I NEED TO BUY TWO OF THESE TO OPERATE TWO DOORS?  I can have headsets, bluetooth devices, connected to several different items SIMULTANEOUSLY, but this can only connect to ONE lock?  You forced me to buy a second one to enable both locks.  That's dirty pool.  It's also why I recommend to anyone to buy a different brand other than AUGUST for your locks.  Bluetooth is capable, but they wanted more MONEY.  Forget August locks.",4,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"I love the concept of the August and August Connect, but each one of them has their issues.  The August itself is somewhat better, but the Connect is pretty bad.  Bottom line is it is very inconsistent and buggy.  Sometimes I can see my August remotely, sometimes I can't.  Sometimes I can unlock my door remotely, sometimes I can't.  The times I am able to unlock my door sometimes I can't lock it again!  I've also had to unplug the connect and plug it back in again to get it working again.  In short it simply isn't reliable enough of a product.  Not sure if the lock or the connect is the culprit, and I'm not about to waste my time with customer support.  It is also not a proximity issue, the connect is within 6' of the lock, and 10-12' of my router.",2,1,2015-10-14,1,5,0
"I don’t know who at August was responsible for designing this thing and how it passed quality assurance but it’s garbage. Configuration was easy enough, however be able to connect leaves much to be desired. Being 38 inches from the lock it claims the Bluetooth signal is low. The test feature in the app can’t find the device. (Most of the time.) I have full WiFi in the garage, but it wouldn’t connect. I had to order a consumer grade WiFi booster and then finally I saw it online. Next I attached it to Alexa, it accepted the command from the echo app to unlock the door, but then disappeared and I wasn’t able to lock it. I don’t know if it’s a bad device or a collection of cheap parts, but it’s not staying at my house.",1,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"When in the home, both my wife and I can speak to the Echo Dots in the house to operate the lock. Fine. When using the Alexa App on my phone and away from the house, I can do the same. Also fine.Unfortunately, we can not use the Alexa App on my wife's phone to command the lock. It replies immediately with ""Sorry, smart locks cannot be controlled on this device"", and it's been FRIG'n impossible to figure out why.

"I'm on August Connect number 2, after their absolutely worthless tech support decided to just have me swap it rather than work through any troubleshooting steps. It still doesn't connect. I have a robust network and several Access Points set up in our home. We have had no other issues with devices on this network. I even dumbed the network down. I made it 2.4 ghz only, put it on a network with every setting I could find online set to it's specific decade's old technology and it still does not function. It says it is joining the network, then gives me a steadily flashing red light. Every. Single. Time. I have reconfigured and searched for answers literally everywhere online. It is subpar technology made exponentially worse by obscenely inept technical support. I wish I was close enough to their headquarters to throw it through their window. I am plugged in 6 ft from the lock, and 15 feet from the Access Point. There is no excuse for it not functioning.",1,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0
"This is my 2nd unit.  First one lasted 16 months. August would not replace it free of charge, because they only back this unit for 12 months.  So I was forced to fork up money for a new one.It would start giving me disconnection messages on my august app, followed by not even powering on when I plug it in.  Every now and then when I plug it in, the light would be a solid red.  So the unit basically died.

"The first thing you need to understand is that this device connects to your lock over bluetooth, just like your phone does -- which is why it is required to be in close proximity to your lock.Not everyone will have an outlet within 15 feet of the front door - but most everyone will have an entryway light.  I purchased",4,1,2017-11-26,1,1,1
"I gave this wifi bridge one star for each lock that can be simultaneously connected to it. It works great, but it was quite an unpleasant surprise when I realized that you need one of these PER LOCK. This fact isn't made very clear by August, and their phrasing in the fine print implies that at some point in the future they will be able to support more than one lock per bridge, but with it being a one-bridge-per-lock system as it stands, they should greatly reduce the cost and make the current one lock limit abundantly clear, because if you're not buying these on sale or bundled together it becomes quite a difference in cost. Proximity to the lock was also a bit odd, with it not connecting to the device when it was plugged in a couple feet away, and then connecting when I moved it a few more feet back.",1,1,2019-4-25,1,1,0
"I put 4 of these in my house. One failed completely and I spent a ridiculous amount of money replacing it. and two others just went offline, leaving the locks non operating. They are incredibly finicky to set up in the first place and ended up in most cases only working if they were within about 6 feet of the lock being controlled, which is absurd for any wireless device.  A Bluetooth mouse that costs one fourth the price can operate reliably at twice the distance.  The locks are very nice but the hubs are problematic to set up, unreliable after they've been setup and working, and absurdly expensive for the functionality being provided.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

Did not work with Siri.  Either device is not meant for it or description on amazon is inaccurate.  Additionally Bluetooth did not work even though the Connect was within 5 feet from the lock.

I bought this in addition to my August smart lock for my front door. I have noticed that it can be glitchy when it comes to auto unlock feature in app. Not to much to do with wi fi bridge. It does lose connectivity from time to time but all in all I love it. We were out of town on vacation and I was able to control access from 100s of miles away. I definitely recommend this product if you have an August smart lock.,4,1,2019-7-27,1,1,0
Turns a convenient device into something I don’t think I could live without  I love the fact that it notifies you when individuals come and leave and of course being  able to unlock the door from anywhere  It gets confused if you go outside out of her different door and doesn’t open the door  if you tried to enter through the door with the lock  When you install it you really have to pay attention to how well the deadbolt locks and make sure it doesn’t rub on the  catch plate.  A lot of doors will close in one position but you have to push on them to lock the deadbolt and this will not work with the lock,4,1,2019-3-31,1,0,0
"After reading all of the bad reviews on this unit, I was tempted right away to buy the August Connect to see if the issue would be operator error or indeed a design flaw with the units. After reading many bad reviews, I assumed that the issue would be with the former since in my experience, many issues with equipment use can be attributed to poor handling by the end user.Being in the unique position of being a repair electronics technician, network/IT technician, and someone who does a lot of DIY work, I was very motivated to tackle on the August Connect.

"The main reason I purchased this product was to stop from having to use bluetooth as the connection to unlock the smart lock.I found that while the remote access features somewhat worked, the device was never unable to unlock my door based upon location detection.  I was careful to follow all the guidelines on their website, such as make sure your phone is not in do not disturb mode, etc.. However, I found that no matter all the guidelines I followed I was still unable to get the product to work.",1,1,2017-5-25,1,3,0
"I also bought the August connect to have it unlock as I get home (geo-fence).  I live where it rains almost everyday, all summer long.  The auto unlock would have been nice, not fumbling with keys in the rain.  Now I must sit in the car and fumble with the phone to unlock the door.  The auto lock/unlock feature does work with voice control via Alexa.  Just will not auto-unlock when you get home (one of the main features) . Because of this, I can only give this lock three stars.  I have contacted August multiple times without any response.  August, fix the unlock feature and get some C/S.10/08/18 I have sent two more e-mails to August's non existing customer service.  You guessed it, NO response. The August app has been updated a little.  The August icon is now visible in the up left of my phone.

"I know the August Smart Lock is always rated the best in the industry if not close to the best. The concept is great and so is the lock if it would be more reliable at picking up you celll Phone signal or blu-tooth signal when arriving home from the August Smart Connect attacment I’m reviewing here. I set the August Smart Connect up perfectly as per the manufacturer also. It’s close to the August Smart door lock. I have my wi-if router box within six feet of the August Smart Connect, and I’m even getting solid or good connection signals from my router and the smart lock. Unfortunatly when I arrive home my front door only recognizes my iPhone 7plus soon to be iPhoneX signal roughly half the time and then automatically opening the August Smart Lock series two. So I’m not a huge fan of the entire August Smart Lock or the August Smart Connect. The main reason I bought the lock is never to have to use a key any longer and to date this does not seem to be working out. $250 or so is a lot of money to spend for the August Smart Lock & The August Connect if there not going to work as advertised.

"We got this because my husband cannot be trusted with keys :) and I am too impatient to fish around for the key and futz with the lock every single time I come and go. So we were pretty sloppy about locking up when we left. (which always made me a tad uncomfortable in the back of my mind) So that is why we got this. We've been using it for about a month now.Installation was pretty easy, and syncing with iphone was a breeze.

"We bought these bridges to go with the August Smart Lock.  The bridge allows Alexa to operate the lock.  Note: Alexa will not unlock the door on command but she will lock it.  Makes sense - you wouldn't want a thief tell her to unlock the door and have her do it... The bridge plugs into an outlet and has to be within 15 feet or so of the lock, the closer the better.  This is the only inconvenience of the bridge.  Depending on where you install the lock, you might be limited in options on where to plug the bridge in.  The bridge was easy to install.  The August software, on the smart phone, walks you through it.  The bridge also has a reset button if installation doesn't work out well the first time.  The bridge was a necessity and we would have preferred not have to use it, but the door locks would not otherwise work with Alexa.  So, this is  a good bridge.  It isn't very big and is easy to use.",5,1,2017-3-4,1,1,0
"August connect allows you to control the August Smart Lock through the internet. It does this by connecting to your WiFi router and then using Bluetooth to connect to the lock. So the connect must be placed someplace that it can easily connect to the lock.Because it is a bridge and has to connect twice it is slow and not reliable. Many times I connect to the lock and when I click on the link option it will loose connection foring me to reconnect. When you click on the lock status to lock it, it will not change for a moment and look unresponsive. Remember your phone just sent the command through the internet to your router, which then sent it to your connect via wifi which will then connect to the smart Lock via Bluetooth. Then it reverses the process to send the lock command.  The August connect need patience to use.",3,1,2017-7-16,1,8,0

Google assisgant for some reason has issues unlocking or locking the door after giving it your passcode.  Other than that, love the autolock feature.

"Conceptually, I love the idea of the August Connect. We have more than one August Smart Lock and this would have been a great companion. However, it's technical capability seems pretty poor and limited. I urge August to update their tech in this little guy. I had to try many different outlet/plugs and configurations to get it to work. You can't have it too close to the WiFi/extender, but not too far. It was quite finicky about placement. Worst than the WiFi, it has to be in a very specific configuration/location adjacent to the August Smart Lock (and not too far away) for the Bluetooth to work with the Smart Lock. The first time I tried to set it up, I couldn't get it to work because of the WiFi extender we were using created an ""extension"" network (2G_EXT and 5G_EXT). For whatever reason, the Connect would not connect to the WiFi through the extension network. Almost a year later, we've upgraded our WiFi network throughout the house and were now able to get WiFi signal by the door where we intended to use the Connect. This led to the second time I set it up. It took close to an hour to reset it and set up again, trying many different locations.We love the August Smart Locks that we have, but they really need to invest some technology and improvements in Connect for this review to be any better than 3 stars.",3,1,2018-7-23,1,0,0

I looked on their support website for port forwarding information to set up a more permanent, trusted connection to the outside world.  There was one article that had a title that showed some promise, but when I tried to open it it says it doesn't exist (so they have some development they need to do on the support part of their web site too).  I couldn't find anything in my initial searches on the web, which surprises me as I can't believe I'm not the only one with this issue...though this may be too new.Anyhow, and again, it works or can be made to.  If you have a newer wireless router you may have some security/connectivity challenges and with support on this difficult to find (I'm still searching but if I find the solution I will post here).",4,1,2015-9-5,1,4,0
"Works exactly as described and flawless after a week of use - we don't expect any problems with the lock.  That said, beware the keys, at the time of this review, cannot be provided to guests by using an email invite even though the August Lock company information indicates email invites can be use to send an electronic key to guests.  Also, August Lock does not allow invites using International text numbers as we learned the hard way.  Invites can be ""sent"" giving the sender the indication an invite was extended, but the guest will NOT get the invite if the text number is of ""international"", meaning not USA or Canada.  I phoned August and spoke to a lady that was to research these problems and get back to me - this was a month ago.  I also contacted August customer support about the same issues and after a month, still no response.  Buyer be aware of this limitation.  I am not impressed with the August company support - they seem rather invisible to assist their customers.",3,1,2015-7-23,1,0,0
"I was really hoping to enjoy using the connect to operate my lock remotly for maintenance visits etc but the Bluetooth function in the Connect is weak.  it never picked up Great strength and always said it was Good, even when 2-3 ft away.  Even then, I had issues with it staying connected so I could agree it.  Just over a year of having it , my Connect doesn't recognize my Bluetooth despite moving my router closer and every other Bluetooth device in my home still working.  i spoke with August who explained it was out of warranty.  I understand warranty limits, I just believe it should have lasted longer than a year and reading other comments, sounds like my unit is not the only one.  I wish August would get better customer service and replace these faulty units to make it right.",1,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"I purchased an August lock some time ago because it was supposedly HomeKit compatible, meaning I could use the Apple Home App on iPhone to control the lock and use Siri.  I knew it would only work in bluetooth range but believed I could add an August Wi-Fi Bridge later to control the lock out of bluetooth range.  I do have an Apple TV but it's out of bluetooth range of the lock. Well, I bought the August Wi-Fi Bridge and it doesn't work with the Apple Home App with the lock.  Nice Homekit support, August.  In fact, my whole experience with the August lock has been subpar.  Bluetooth range is not great and it sucks batteries.  I understand the later generations are better, but I for one will never buy another August product.  This is easily one of the worst tech experiences I've had and the inability of August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge to work with Homekit is the final straw.",1,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
"Less than 10 ft from lock, perhaps 5ft away, and App consistently shows inconsistent signal strength feedback (see image). Sometimes it shows ""Good"" BLE Signal, sometimes ""Poor"", somethings  ""Great"". So, which is it? Randomness and inconsistency gives the impression of cheap components. For the price and unique functionality it leaves a lot to wish for.",2,1,2017-4-21,1,3,1
"What an absolute piece of trash.  This is one of the worst sw engineering efforts ever on this planet.  Mine will not connect from android nor ios phones.  Bybsome miracle 1/8 tries on the first day was able to connect.  That lasted w whole 3 days.  Then I came home to a solid red led.  Meaning it is waiting in config mode.  And the 20 or sob times I've tried, I cannot get it to successfully connect.  Just watching this piece of stupidity go thru the connection sequence shows what a piece of garbage the unit is.  It reboots at least 3 times, and each reboot seems to take longer.  After 3 minutes of up and downs, different led patterns each time, it finally reboots with a red solid led and the app says my internet is not working..  But it's working will enough for me to write this review!!  Junk!!  I had been happy with the lock, but after seeing this engineering marvel, I refuse to have any product from these hacks in my possession, and will get rid of the lock as well.  This should be very simple, no idea how they could have messed this up so poorly.  Please don't believe the company sponsored success stories here, this could not possibly work reliably for anyone.",1,1,2015-10-24,1,9,0
"Doesn't work. Connects just fine. (well sort of. Has to be in line of site and about 6 feet away from the lock to get anything other than a ""poor"" bluetooth signal. My phone can be 30 feet away in another room and connect to the lock via bluetooth, so I assume there's either an antenna problem or a very-poor-quality radio unit in the Connect). Doesn't work once connected, though. I do computer stuff for a living, so my guess is that the real problem is August's server. It's unlikely that the connect talks directly to your phone over your local network. Instead, it talks to a server that August runs out in the cloud somewhere. Your phone then connects to the same server over the internet. The lock is linked to the phone through that server. The behavior I'm seeing reeks of badly done server software, so it's probably not the physical device, but rather the lousy server-side software that the device uses to talk to your phone. Frankly, none of that matters if you can't unlock your door. It's the system that you're buying, not the physical device. August needs to hire somebody competent to rewrite their server-side system, though.",1,1,2016-8-16,1,6,0

So far I have enjoyed this system.  I live on the third floor and I was always having to drop everything and find my key to go inside.  This has the door unlocked as I approach the door!

For two years I had this connected to my door. And randomly out of the blue it just stopped working. Nothing will fix it nothing does anything it won't function in any way.And customer service is the most unhelpful thing on the face of the Earth. and nothing else has changed it's not like I have a new Wi-Fi router and it can't pick it up it just randomly stopped working and randomly won't connect to my Wi-Fi anymore.,1,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I installed the August Smart Lock & Wifi Connect in January and it is now May. Most of time the lock takes 3 or more tries to connect. It has left me outside for 5 or 6 minutes, multiple times. The lock/app wanted me to create a new account after 4 months & locked me out of the house for 30+ minutes while I was on the phone with tech support. I'm tossing this lock & giving up the $300 I wsated on it. Read reviews to see how long people have owned these. Cool at first, yet in reality they stink.",1,1,2017-5-2,1,1,0
"Just like all the reviews, it is terribly difficult to connect to your wifi. But after trial and error, moving routers around, I got it to work in about 20mins. After it did its initial connection I was able to move my router back to it's normal place and the Connect+router+phone all worked seamlessly.

"The network option for accessing the August lock is less reliable than my Jaguar. I use this to ensure guests and tenants lock the door on their way out. Unfortunately, I might be able to see my door is left unlocked all day, but there's nothing I can do about it. The action to lock it just times out over and over most of the time.

They kept on trying everything they could to help, even reading the manual for my specific router and recommending changes.  The only thing that finally made my LG G2 AT&T phone (using Straight Talk) was it updating itself to Android 5.0.2.  When it was running Android 4.0, it didn't work.

Love this product. Was a breeze to install -- I simply plugged it in and opened the August app to connect it to my home network and August lock.The August connect allows for the August lock to be accessed and controlled over wifi.

Enables you to check the status os the lock from anywhere and also remotely lock/unlock the device.,5,1,2015-11-26,1,1,0
"Works like magic.  I'm now using them in two locations and very happy with them. I use them with the keypad and love the whole system. August access has the  best customer support around.  Fast and effective.This in marked contrast to a company like Lockstate, which lock setup instructions were complex & inaccurate, and whose ""customer support"" required long wait times of 20-60 minutes just to talk someone-who often could not help.

I would think for the price that the team that develops this product would not have any issues connecting via bluetooth. I have aftermarket bluetooth speakers that I can be connected to from 15 feet away and not have issues. This product may not be worth the cost to some people, however 90% of the time it works for me and I like the functionality of being able to unlock the door for someone when I'm not home.",3,1,2017-10-31,1,1,0
This bridge is the only way to make the August Lock work when out of range of Bluetooth. It works great as I can see the door’s status when not home. Your WiFi will affect its performance si be sure to have a strong signal. My lock works instantly when I give it the signal.,5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"Signal gets killed by metal cover on August lock itself (magnetic metal plate in my case).  Guessing when they bench tested the radio in this thing it was next to a lock that was in pieces.  I can put this a few feet away and get bad signal regardless of orientation.  BUT, removing the metal cover plate from the august lock itself, signal strength shoots up +10-+15 over previous...  They built the lock so strong it keeps in/out Bluetooth signals!!!  I'm replacing the metal cover with a 3D printed one to see if the signal stays the same.  Nice lock... Too Nice!",2,1,2018-2-3,1,0,0
"The wi-fi bridge works well, but is not bulletproof. First, as I learned through trial and error, it has to be pretty close to the lock. Next, it has to be off to the side, not directly in front.

Finally, I've never gotten the invites to work (we've tried on two different occasions).

"When I first received it, it was tough to find a location that was optimal for it to connect.  Now that I found the proper location, it works great.

This is a required accessory if you’re installing in August smart door lock and want to integrate it with Alexa and/or a SimpliSafe alarm system.I only gave it four stars because it has somewhat limited range; it must be plugged into an electrical receptacle close to the door in which you install the August lock.

The outlet is directly adjacent to the door without anything in between, and the physical distance between the Connect bridge and the smart lock is about 2 feet.

This doesn’t make a difference in wether or not the damn lock will open when I get home.  Sure I can manually unlock it from my phone but the auto unlock feature is why I purchased this lock and the bridge and it doesn’t work most of the time.  Extremely disappointed.,1,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
It’s really nice to be able to lock and unlock my door from anywhere and check to see if it’s locked.  The only downside is when the router goes out occasionally it doesn’t auto connect again and you have to run through the whole painful setup again.  The setup takes a long time too.  You need to switch your phone to the 2g network in order to set it up because it doesn’t support 5g.But all in all works well once set up.,4,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"My August lock is like 3 feet away but it kept giving poor bluetooth connection. Tried in multiple locations. I had to connect it to an extension cord and put it on a high stool, practically less than a feet away from the lock to get a good bluetooth connection, not even excellent. I was so frustrated I was about to return it. However it still does what it is supposed to do even with poor bluetooth connection. So, we decided to keep it.",3,1,2018-1-20,1,7,0
"it has to be ridiculously close to the lock to function. I tried plugging it into an outlet about 12-13 feet away, and it was spotty. moved it to an outlet 5 feet away and works like a champ. connecting the bridge via the app is a little clunky, need to improve the directions.  Not a fan of the connection button being on the face of the bridge. Being that the bridge had to be so close to the lock, I had to plug it in at a lower outlet. My toddler was able to push the button and interrupt the connection to the lock. this should be engineered to have a cover or something to prevent accidental interruption.",3,1,2018-5-31,1,0,0
"I could never get this to work.  I contacted August support several times about the issue, but never got a good or any response from them.  The concept is a good one, but August still has some work to do in their programming I think.  I ended up selling this to someone else and am now using a keypad lock instead, which works just as it should.  No need for me to worry if I or a trusted friend can get into my house when they need to now.",2,1,2016-10-5,1,0,0
"I should have listened to the other reviews before I bought this. The device needs to be practically next to the August  lock in order to get a Bluetooth signal.

I will just have to wait to upgrade my entire August lock at some point.",2,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
Did not expect to need this device. We bought the August Lock thinking we could operate it with our Zigbee hub from Echo Show. Wrong!The August Lock requires Z-Wave hub. Info was a little misleading. Had to buy the Z-Wave hub from August Lock.,3,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I have this so I can remotely unlock my August smart lock.  It is only 8' away in the hallway, but connection is weak.  It takes several seconds for it to connect to the lock from the app.  I wonder if the internal connector is u.fl and could be replaced with a u.fl to sma connector so a 2.4ghz dipole antenna could be added externally to improve the range?  I may crack it open some day and find out.",3,1,2017-10-23,1,0,0

I use the august lock for my rental properties as well as some renovation properties.  Nice to know I don't have my security compromised with potential extra keys out there.  Also having a log of those entering and exiting the property is very handy.  Very easy to issue access through their app.  Highly recommend.,5,1,2019-4-20,1,0,0
"It works, but it was a chore to find an outlet near enough to the door to get a decent Bluetooth signal to the Smart Lock AND get the wifi signal (the router is about 15 feet away).Also, it would be nice if they made the devices recognizable to Alexa so you can directly voice command it open and closed rather than having Alexa ask the August skill to open or close the lock, it would make it a lot more simple. Fingers crossed they simplify this soon. #firstworldproblems",3,1,2018-8-18,1,0,0
"I think I like this addition to the August lock, so long as it continues working properly. It permits locking and unlocking while away from home, as well as monitoring the status of the lock remotely. However, during the first few days that it was up and running the door kept spontaneously unlocking, which shook my confidence in the product. It has since had a firmware update, and seems to be working perfectly now.",4,1,2015-7-27,1,2,0
Turns your August smart lock into a truly smart lock. Without it you can't unlock your door remotely or using a smart speaker so what's the point. Not the cheapest option but the only option for renters and worth the price IMO.,5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"Works great. I have a plug by my front door so I didn't have any issues with connectivity. My router is also near by in the front room.  I read other reviews where people experienced issues, but I haven't had those issues. Alexa can unlock the door if I'm in the kitchen and I'm expecting someone.",5,1,2018-11-9,1,0,1
"I own a vacation rental cottage in Paris, AR and live in TX.  This allows me to remotely open and lock the doors for guests, if needed, or to just check to ensure they lock up when they leave.  Really gives me 'peace of mind'.  The only 'negative' I could say is that you have to place it close to the lock in order for it to work properly, so be sure you have a plug close to the lock for use.",4,1,2017-6-17,1,0,0

Fairly easy setup and so far (1 week) has been reliable. Not impressed at all with the fact that each lock needs a bridge and the bridges need to be plugged into a receptacle fairly close to each lock. There has to be a better way!,3,1,2018-4-29,1,1,0
August connect is about 4 feet from the lock and the Bluetooth connection is bad. I replaced the batteries on the lock with lithium batteries and no luck Bluetooth connection is still bad. I purchased the connect and I've had it for one day now we'll see how it works with a bad Bluetooth connection but I'm about ready to return the lock and the connection. I will update this review in a few days I'll let you know if I had to return everything or not.,1,1,2018-1-5,1,0,0
"Works but not quite perfect. I have fiber running into the house and sometimes this thing has a difficult time talking to the August. It's good, don't get me wrong; but far from perfect. I would say it works 80% of the time, that extra 20 is concerning when you're worried if the door is locked or not. A good reply would be the ""ever lock"" feature, but that feature i would say works about 75% of the time.Go for it, just know this won't give you 100% peace of mind.",3,1,2015-6-29,1,1,0
Ok at first this thing sucked.  For 6 months it was a brick on the wall and only worked %50 of the time.  Since then there's been a firmware update in the locks and now this thing is awesome!  It works every time.  I've used it from 1000 miles away to unlock my door for a friend over the internet.  Awesomesauce.,5,1,2016-5-5,1,4,0

"Remote control for a smart lock is a must and while August should have released this with the lock itself, better late than never!So does it work? For the most part, yes. I received my Connect within the first week of release, went to set it up, and instantly ran into an issue. My phone could not connect to the... Connect. For such a simple product, I couldn't believe it wasn't working out of the box. I called August support and ran through a lot of troubleshooting. It ended up resulting in the Connect still not working and me waiting about 2 hours for an email back.",4,1,2015-3-22,1,2,1
"The wifi bridge is 10-15 feet from the wifi, less than 5 ft from the deadbolt and yet it always takes a while to reconnect often has issues connecting at all so I have to recalibrate while holding packages or groceries, and it almost NEVER automatically opens when I arrive home.",1,1,2018-6-22,1,0,0

"Feb 13, 2018Works as expected most of the times. My Connect is plugged in very close to the door (less than a feet) and have an excellent WiFi signal at that spot. Takes time when you try to connect remotely. Sometimes you have to turn on/off the 'Remote Connect' button few times to connect to the lock. Most of the times, you have to wait 30 seconds for the app to connect remotely to the lock.",3,1,2018-2-13,1,0,0

"I’m on my 2nd generation of August locks for two houses and in every case, they work great. The key to that is the August Bridge.When the August Pro locks came out, I went ahead a purchased two for my house. The features added into the August Pro, such as auto-lock and -unlock, and door-sense proved just too convenient to live without, so I recently replaced the older August locks on my office without august Pros. Key in their use is the bridge.",5,1,2018-8-15,1,0,0
It is a good idea for August lock to have a wifi connected feature. Can unlock it remotely. The August connect is nice but it has to be plugged in cannot be hardwired to router.

"First we purchased the August Smart Lock.  After spending 45 minutes on phone with a service tech, he told us it was defective and we returned and got a working replacement.  Once we realized that only one person could have remote lock access, we then bought this Wi-Fi Bridge so both my wife and I could provide remote unlocking access.with our iPhones.  After spending 30 minutes with another service tech, he told us this unit was defective and to replace it.  We are not going to replace it.  We originally avoided buying a iPad that would also provide the Wi-fi features we wanted, but it was a $300 plus expense we were trying to avoid.  But due to the poor August product quality (not tech service), we will no longer buy their products until their quality improves.  We will buy an iPad instead..",2,1,2017-4-15,1,0,0

I am not that tech and I had no issues installing this and the smart lock.",5,1,2018-8-22,1,0,0
Works on and off. It has to be reeeeaaaallly close to the August lock for it to work and be reeeeeaallly close to wifi and even then it sometimes doesn't work. It will say that the door is locked and that it locked the door and Ill get home and its unlocked. I wouldn't rely on it to lock you door remotely.

For the longest time I couldn't use it because I thought my batteries were low and that's why it said it was not close enough but i replaced three batteries in the lock and got the same error so i ignored the message and continued setting it up and add long as my phone isn't on battery saver mode the auto unlock works great the wifi creates a larger window which gives the lock more time to connect the lock which it definitely needs,4,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0

It does take 10-15 sec to connect when initiating wifi connection away from home but is not a problem and now makes it extremely easy to give one time entrance to people that don't need everyday access, maintenance requests and also for people who are not tech savvy because inviting someone and sending them a key to use at the door can be a lil cumbersome.

And for the price tag on it I was extremely pissed off that I paid 249.00 for the lock.\On to this item...I saw this and thought well at least August is making an attempt to right the ship and fix some of the issues with the lock and accessibility that should have been built into the lock in the first place. The bluetooth on the lock itself does NOT work well at all and had hopes the geofencing would interface well.. lt does NO!

Finally, there are some design quirks - you need one Connect per lock, instead of one Connect per home, and, importantly, only one person can see the lock state at a time, meaning if my wife and I try to look at the lock status at the same time, like if there's someone at the door, connection will fail for one of the two of us.",3,1,2017-9-22,1,0,0

"Not ready for prime time!  The idea is good, the implementation however is awful.  It would find my router and connect and work the first time, but ONLY once.  After that, it NEVER worked!  It always showed connected but would not open the lock, the only solution was to disconnect it from the router completely and start from the beginning again; but each time it would work once, then never again.  The entire August line just is not ready to work in real life use.  Walking to your door and having to wait and repeatedly try to unlock the door just is inconvenient - in my opinion, Bluetooth is NOT the technology to use for door locks (even though all the ""smart home"" devices are going that way) it is a mistake.  Even having the keep the battery burning Bluetooth radio turned ""on"" makes the whole solution not work.  (run your battery down all day just to unlock your door once or twice a day??  no.  And to have to turn on Bluetooth just to unlock your door?  Inconvenient!).  August needs to go back to square 1, begin again and have a complete WiFi solution designed in an all-in-one unit (and for those out there ""worried"" someone could hack the WiFi device and gain entry to your house....it is WAY easier to smash a window or kick on the door; if someone wants in, really not much will stop them and to avoid WiFi for that reason is crazy)",1,1,2015-11-7,1,3,0

I use IOS and Android so I am quite aware of the app differences and how the Android app just does not even come close to competing with it's IOS equivalent, but until someone is willing to do something about it then why complain??  I actually e-mailed August to see if I could possibly beta test for them so that they could get out a better performing Android app out there to the public and have it work like it should.  The problem is that IOS and Android don't have the same hardware standards and IOS has had low power bluetooth ever since the iPhone 4s but there are still Android devices that are coming out now that don't have this feature set and that's why we have the problem that we do with the lack of features on the Android app.  Also, if you want to put your faith into ANY electronic device to open your home up before you are in a arms length range then you go for it, but I won't turn on that feature just because it has not been that accurate for me and I understand why!  It's not the maker of the August connect or even the lock, it's the technology being used that's not ready for that feature.

"So I own the 2nd generation August Lock which is the equivalent to the 3rd generation (latest) August Lock Pro which comes with the August connect. I bought he August Lock 2nd generation as soon as I found out it was Apple HomeKit compatible. So the August Lock. I give that about a 3.5 stars. Previously before August made their latest updates it was at least 4 stars. It would do as it should. It would lock and unlock with the app or automatically if you were approaching the house and were within range if that’s how you had it set. It wouldn’t connect 100% of the time but it would 80-90% of the time if using WiFi connected to an Apple TV or iPad that permanently stays at home that you use as your module. Sometimes it would lose connection and you would have to wait to connect and then it would connect and would work. But if you were within 20’ it would unlock and lock the door a 100% of the time because it was using Bluetooth. The reason I’m telling you this is after some software updates either on August or iOS 11 and me relocating my Apple TV to the basement I was only able to connect with August Lock to unlock and lock the door 30-50% of the time. Which is definitely not good! So why am I talking about August Lock first and not the connect. It’s because I thought due to me moving Apple TV I bought it needed a closer connection device to August Lock so I got the August connect thinking that it would help. But unfortunately I learned it has not. I literally a waste of money. When I setup the August Connect which is like 6-7’ away from the August Lock at the outlet closest to it which is on the same wall. I kept disconnecting and I didn’t know why. I looked at the settings and my WiFi said great connection but Bluetooth said poor connection. I reached out the August and they said I should install the August connect facing the August Lock at the closest outlet less than 7’ away. That’s ridiculous because this is Bluetooth not an IR connector like a remote control and tv. It should connect within 30’ any direction even through walls. But the fact that I was told thatade me realize the support person responding has no idea about Bluetooth and should be trained better. So I escalated this matter to another customer support agent/Manager. They responded and went through checklist and asked about my WiFi and I said I have a whole house mesh router at a 1gb connection so WiFi is great. Then he did a diagnose of the Bluetooth and said it’s not the August connect it’s the signal from the lock. I said then what? I basically got an okay is that all you need? Can we help you with anything else! Really? No hey send us the August Connevt back and we refund your money, or send us the lock so we can try and diagnose it or better let’s send you a new one to make sure yours it’s not defective. Nope. Nothing. This is when I wished Apple made all these devices because for the most part they try and fix things when broken and make things work the first time before putting them into the marketplace. I digress. This isn’t about Apple. This is about my August Lock and I wanted to buy more of these for other locks around my house and recommend them to others but I don’t think I can in this current state. Hope this will help some of you before you purchase this August connect or even the August Lock. I was thinking about switching to another lock but haven’t found anything else I want yet. I guess I’m hoping August will own up to their fault issue and fix my lock. They will focus on not just tying to come out with new products and sell but perfect the ones they have and make their current customers happy!",2,1,2017-11-4,1,2,0

"I bought this sucker halfway expecting I'd need to ship it back shortly after receiving it -- given all the reviews on here about problems getting the Connect to, well, connect to home wifi networks as well as with the Smart Lock itself -- but the number of problems I've had with it is precisely *zero*. I didn't have to engage in any elaborate ""trickery"" to get it working, e.g. moving my wifi router around to various locations in order to maintain a connection. Despite said router being separated from the Connect unit by 20 feet and multiple walls (plus my router's located at the bottom of my bedroom closet - long story), the Connect detected it on the first try, and I've had 100% uptime since then. Also haven't had any problems with locking or unlocking the door with my phone from any given location (the Apple HomeKit app on my iPhone works perfectly with it).I can't explain why I've had zero problems while other folks have had plenty, but I'll note that I have an unusually good router as well as exceptionally good internet service: I lucked out and ended up living somewhere with Google Fiber, its gigabit-speed ISP. In practice its connection speed is ""only"" about 450Mbps most of the time, but still: it's seriously quick, and could explain why my particular August setup has been problem-free. OTOH the Connect is plugged in directly underneath a Google Nest thermostat, which is explicitly *not* compatible with Apple HomeKit (but also connects to my Google-supplied wifi router without problem). So who knows - maybe I lucked out.",5,1,2017-4-3,1,0,0
"It's flaky.  Sometimes it works great, but usually when you need it, it doesn't.

"Not reliable at all.  The concept is amazing but the execution is weak at best.  It seems to me that August pushed out a product that wasn't ready for consumers.I have a house that is set up for AirBnB and I bought the august lock 2nd gen, the keypad, and the connect.  I did this so that I could let people in the house without being there and so that I would have a dynamic, personalized entry code for each guest that would expire when they leave.  Theoretically the August Connect allows me to do these things.  Unfortunately it randomly stops working from time to time for no reason.  Within the first week of owning the system locked me out of the house 3 times.  Lucky I had the key to the back door.  It will usually connect again by itself after 10-20 min but I can't afford to have my guests waiting for it to start working again.",1,1,2016-7-21,1,2,0

Once the bluetooth was disconnected, we had to remove the batteries from the lock and let it reset itself.  The door was left unlocked without access to check it for 4 days....

Remote Connect, which is the entire point of this device (to look/unlock your door remotely via wifi) has worked once out of maybe forty times.

"First, let me say that I am a big fan of the August lock.  One of the main reasons why I purchased it was for the WIFI ability through the August connect.  I have spent many times with customer service working through the issues of this product.  It is a complete waste of money that is unreliable.  It constantly goes offline, and the process of getting it back to pair is brutal.  It will pair one out of every 20 times if I am lucky.  I have no idea why it constantly goes offline and refuses to repair, but it involves unpinning it from august and hoping that it works.  Save your money and buy something else.  Customer service is friendly, but it is of little help when the steps that I waste all day Saturday following do not work.  I am en electronics technician with an IT background...Even I cannot get this piece of garbage to work correctly and stay paired. But, the august lock itself is great...",1,1,2016-3-13,1,5,0

I really wanted the August Connect to work.  I tried many times over several days to connect the August Connect to my Wi-Fi system with no success.  I called the August support center and they declared that I had a defective unit and sent me another one.  But the second one had the exact same results as the first.  I have a Nexus 5 phone with the latest Marshmallow update and a strong Wi-Fi signal.  My number one goal was remote access so this is a deal breaker.  I returned all my August products including 2 door locks and will try with a completely different system later.,1,1,2016-2-27,1,2,0

Couple months after I purchased the August Connect, it stopped working. Light wouldn't light up, no response from the thing at all. Completely broken. No support online and I procrastinated calling support... BIIIIIIIG mistake.Recently moved into a new house and wanted to set up my Lock and Connect, remembered my Connect doesn't work, and since it's now been over a year, I'm SOL and stuck buying another $50 connect. Frustrating I have to buy it twice, not confident it will even last a whole year. Also frustrated there's no troubleshooting try getting it to work again or some kind of offer to mail it in and fix it for me. so now i have an expensive paper weight...",1,1,2016-12-29,1,1,0

I thought that once you connected this to your wifi network, it would switch between your home network and your phone LTE/3G service. Does that happen? Nope. Instead, they add another button on your lock in the app, and when you don't connect with bluetooth, you click on that button and it takes a million years to locate your lock.

When I got my August Connect AC-R2 the directions and specs sheet that came in the box were labeled for AC-R1 (the first generation Connect). I called August's customer service to ask about the new specs and was told the AC-R2 is identical to the AC-R1 in every way except that it is preloaded with the latest firmware version out of the box. Although the firmware on AC-R1 will automatically upgrade to the newest version when it is connected to the internet. So do not be fooled and pay extra for this product! Save yourself $30 and just get the first generation August Connect.,1,1,2015-11-30,1,6,0

"I am disappointed by August. There are MANY glitches in their products and if you think it will work seamlessly, guess again. And I am a tech geek and I still have glitches that can't be fixed. The bluetooth connectivity is weak, the WiFi connectivity takes A LONG TIME (and I have two connection speeds: Google Fiber & Xfinity 180mbps speeds). August connect sits immediately in front of my front door (3' away from the August lock) which again is 2' away from my Xfinity WiFi. I have both an iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy and the bluetooth fails to connect on both devices. I bought it for my Airbnb rental property and I stopped using it after the first month.

I wouldn't buy any products by August. I purchased both the Smart Lock and Smart connect and neither work correctly. The autolock/auto unlock just doesn't work (at least without the connect feature) because even at the shortest geofence zone your outside of the bluetooth range to connect back to the lock. I bought the Connect hoping this would resolve the problem but the Connect wont connect to my network on which is on a google TP Link router which does broadcast on a frequency that's supposed to be compatible. The app seemed to have several glitches even stupid stuff like not being able to update the profile pic once set. I was really hoping this would work since the lock mechanism is internal which I need due to homeowners policy to keep outside locks the same. Great product in theory but this company really fails on execution.Too many bugs for me. I did reach out to their support department who are fairly responsive via email but after going back and forth decided to just return the product since they don't seem to have the kinks worked out.,1,1,2015-11-29,1,6,0

"I could write down my saga with trying to get my smart lock to work, but here is the gist.  I DO NOT recommend an August smart lock, but that review will go under that product- suffice it to say I am not pleased. This device is used to connect the ""smart"" lock (which you will have already doled out 200 hundred bucks for) to the internet. Yes, you read that correctly, the smart lock itself is not actually internet-connected without buying this expensive dongle. Otherwise its just a fancy deadbolt. The Connect bridge only allows you to connect one lock, so if you have more than one door in your house, you have to shell out hundreds of dollars to connect them all. According to installation instructions, the bridge needs to be within 30 feet of the lock; according to reality, it needs to be within 5 feet, so if you don't have an outlet IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT to your door, it will not connect. Finally, if you use an Android phone, it will almost never connect to the device, you will have to close and open the app numerous times, and re-start the installation several times from scratch.  This device is also not compatible with Google Wifi, and presumably other ""mesh"" networks, as it needs to connect to a specific access node, and it is often impossible to determine which one you are connecting to, and all of them will have the same name in the list of nearby networks.In summary: if you have an Android device, or a Google Wifi, or more than one door in your home, or a long distance between your door and nearest indoor power outlet, you will have a bad time.  The iOS version of the app seems to work A LOT better, but alas, that does not work for me.",1,0,2017-9-7,1,0,0
"We purchased this lock shortly after it came out.  We've gone through a few upgrades,  some with problems ...however,  I must say that we do love this lock.  It can be programmed to lock after a certain time delay,  access can be given to any number to people.  The app is ready for our children to use.  What I love most about this was the time our oldest forgot his phone.  He called us from a friends phone as he was being dropped off to tell us he was home but couldn't get in.  We were still about 10 min away but connected quickly and unlocked the door for him.  Very convenient.  Looking forward to trying their new products soon",5,0,2016-1-19,1,6,0
"Works great. Requires periodic double checking to keep everything working. Either by restarting or checking the batteries so it’s not a set up and forget about it device. But it’s nice to know that I can unlock the door remotely and let people into our apartment if needed. It’s nice to have the capability. Though I will say, I admit I’ve actually used it far less often than I thought I might. So there’s that. Then again maybe that’s not true. Integration is pretty seemless so maybe I’m connecting via WiFi a lot of the times when I’m doing smart Home stiff with out realizing it. Overall, happy with it.As a whole I think the August is an excellent product. Easy to install. Doesn’t require permanent modification for renters. And worst case scenario, when it stops working, it reverts to a normal lock rather than locking you out. Like a broken down escalator just turns into stairs (as opposed to an elevator where you are out of luck)",5,0,2018-5-19,1,0,0

"I love it. Every time I pull into my driveway it unlocks the door for me. Too bad apple HomeKit doesn’t do it automatically. U have to tap a notification that pops up and if phone is locked it has to be unlocked first. But with August app alone it does auto unlock without having to take phone out of my pocket. The only thing I do not like is there is no geofence for locking the door. I don’t want it to auto lock every time door opens and closes and I don’t want it on a timer. You have to setup a geofence area for Auto Unlock so it recognizes u are back in home area which it’s prob about a quarter mile circle around my home but it doesn’t unlock at that point, it unlocks once I’m pulling into driveway which is maybe 35’ from the lock. I didn’t get the Bluetooth keypad which I think I may that way if I’m leaving the house and not just staying in the yard I can just hit a button as pass out door rather then pull phone out and have to manually go into app to lock. IFTTT does not work for setting it to lock for crossing an area but it is compatible for other recipes. You get to keep your old lock and keys so it great for people who can’t change out their locks because of renting or other reasons. It is a bit bulky on the door but it’s only on the inside and most other smart locks are too. I’ve never had trouble with it not locking from a far over my cell service and always unlocks when I get home.

"We wanted a system to allow us to answer the door from our chair as it takes a long enough time to get up, that people leave. In combination with a Ring video doorbell pro, a Samsung hub and an Echo Show, we now have that ability.

Not working, either a manual lock movement or with the app and Alexa works fine again.  I don't know if the Connect  , August lock, Samsung hub or Echo Show is at fault.

"Overall: Works great w/ Amazon Echo.  Would buy again.  Connects my August doorbell and lock together.  Simple setup.What I found important: Having a strong router/signal strength is key.  Before upgrading my router, I had a basic $20-30 one and half the time I couldn't connect to it with my phone.  August equipment/app did recognize the low signal, so it was kinda clear that I needed a better router.  After that, performance has been very consistent.  Also, you have to redo the setup completely to change Wi-Fi networks (probably a good security measure too).",5,0,2018-2-10,1,0,0

The app set up was easy until it came time to invite additional users. It is as a little confusing, but the good news is that I called the tech help line and the gent I spoke with was polite, accurate and had me on my way in less than 5 minutes. The WiFi bridge was odd in that the first plug I tried to use, which was the closest to the door lock would not connect, so I moved it to another one a little further away around a corner and it linked up no problem.  The lock itself was easy as anything I’ve ever installed.

The Schlage locks we used with them too and we had ""the lock,and key man"" in sandwich IL install them.  We use both Android LG phone and I phone, the Wi-Fi connection that feature along with Z Wave mean never worry about locking doors.  We feel safe and we use one to let our dog walker use her virtual key.  Our college son he gets his virtual key. We know who comes and goes. Got groceries in your hands the door locks know you and automatically unlock the door,  It's the best automatic door locks and we can say well worth every penny spent. It evens tells the person if batteries are low and if each door closed, correctly so,the door is  truly locked.  August engineers have to be rocket engineers we believe.  They thought of every gotcha and we never have a gotcha even if power in our home goes out. My wife stated, “ a  Mom” or a ‘women”  must have had a say in its design because it's even keeps Mom from worrying if the doors are locked, and who locked or unlocked it.There's is no better well made Auto lock in the world.  It is a reliable lock system.  We have both a version 4 and a version 2 with August Connect devices. The virtual key to our dog walker is such a relief and gift.

"Changing the wifi password or network on an August Connect is a very delicate process, and if you don't do it exactly right you will brick your device rendering it completely inoperable. It gets stuck on a loop of the green light blinking 10 times fast and the red light blinking 25 times fast.

"I have an August lock and the only  real flaw in it is the exceedingly long connect time for Bluetooth.  I hoped that the Connect would alleviate these problems by tracking state of the lock and allowing me to just launch the app and poke the lock or unlock button immediately.  Instead, the connect is even slower than bluetooth only.Basically, if it's slower than keys, the lock has failed.  If it's slower than driving home from work to let someone in (exaggerating a bit), it's a disaster.",3,0,2015-4-16,1,2,0
"Just bought this device.  So far, it has very poor reliability.  I actually think the problem is more about the lock's weak blue tooth signal strength than this device.  However, the only reason I bought these devices together was for the pure purpose of having access to the lock remotely from anywhere.  So, despite where the weakness lies, this lock shares the pain of a poor review.  I have moved this device to multiple receptacles.  The blue tooth signal has been very inconsistent at any 1 location.  It will either report a poor signal or excellent signal, but not a consistent one.  I have a feeling I'll be sending both devices back.  A really cool idea, but very poor delivery of the concept.",1,0,2018-3-21,1,0,0

It works great with the August app.  The lock doesn’t use the bridge for HomeKit it uses only Bluetooth. With our shop and house a 100ft apart the WiFi would help HomeKit.

WiFi bridge and lock both work very well. Easy to install and connect. The app walks your through almost the whole process. I would buy it again.

"August is a company who has impressed me with its Smart Lock for home automation. The August Smart Lock started with only the option to use Bluetooth to unlock your door. This meant you had to be within a certain range to open your door. This is actually a great feature because if power goes out you can still lock and unlock your door. August even lets you send invites to people you would like to let in your home while you are away. Unfortunately, there is a downside. What if the person you send the invite to doesn’t have a smartphone?The great team at August thought about this and came up with the solution – a small adapter called the Connect. “With August Connect, August is expanding the range of functionality for our users, delivering new experiences around secure, intelligent access to the home,” said Jason Johnson, CEO and co-founder of August. “While the existing Bluetooth connectivity in the August Smart Lock allows it to be a truly offline, independent device, August Connect enhances that core offering with new benefits such as real time and WiFi Internet connectivity.”",5,0,2015-3-19,1,8,1

I do wish the batteries lasted longer but if you think about it you lock and unlock your door often in a day (at least we do) and it is literally a motor physically rotating a deadbolt back and forth.

Tried to set it up less than 5 feet from my lock and could not get it to work, due to poor Bluetooth connectivity.  Well, August suggests trying to make sure the connect is facing upwards and mine was facing sideways in an outlet expander.  Removed the outlet expander and plugged connect in alone and upright; no difference.  August suggests trying different outlets (even if a little further away) in the general vicinity.  I tried it at twelve feet, I tried it at 15 feet, with direct line of sight; No difference, no difference.

August came recommended to me by my dad who has been using it for over a year. It is the best lock available for not replacing your existing deadbolt (my apartment will not let my change the lock/key) I've had numerous guests dl the app and use it to initially enter the apartment with ease. The only guests who have trouble are international guests (don't really know why) or guests without smartphones and in those cases I have them notify me of their time frame and I unlock it remotely. It's also great for when I forget my keys or have to lend them out - I always carry my cell pphone.

I have the earlier version of the August Connect and I find it works reasonably well.

"I purchased this from August directly, not from Amazon, to add to my August Smartlock. Its unfortunate the experience a couple other reviewers have had on here with this product, my experience has been quite different. I love this add-on to the lock itself and it not only setup extremely easy, but has worked very well and I really like being able to verify the lock is engaged when I am away or be able to remote lock and unlock the door. My experience with the SmartLock itself has been equally great. I use the geofencing to lock and unlock the door the most. When I first got the lock that feature was still in beta and there were occasions it did not unlock when I arrived home (I always used the app to manually lock the door since the feature was in beta)..but often this would happen after I had restarted the phone. If I remembered to launch the app after doing so, it always seemed to work well, especially after the latest batch of updates.The Connect, in my opinion, takes a great product and makes it even better. But, keep in mind, there are a lot of variables at play here...technology isn't perfect...wireless communication isn't perfect...life isn't perfect. I mean COME ON people...you can unlock your door with your freakin phone...its pretty amazing where this technology of home automation is heading. Keep in mind, those of us who have taken the plunge are the early adopters...we will be the ones who help smooth out the rough edges...as time goes on the tech will improve.",5,0,2015-3-18,1,1,0

"I would give this device a 0 if I could.  It refuses to connect to any of the 4 WiFi networks I have in my house.  Two broadcast on the 2.4 GHz band, and 2 operate on the 5 GHz band.  Channel switching does not help the issue of connectivity.Also - for those wondering, it s a 2.4 GHz WiFi only device.  That's a shame given that modern technology embraced both bandwidths a long time ago.  Note that I am very tech savvy; I set up networks for friends, and build computers for fun in PC gaming and PC multimedia production.  I'm a tech service representative for friends and family, and often beat my company's IT representative to the end issue prior to even calling them.  I have no connectivity issues with any other device throughout my house - from laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart TVs, a Nest thermostat, and the list goes on.  This is sad that the device just fails to connect at all despite repeated attempts through the application.",1,0,2016-1-11,1,5,0

"Guys, perhaps you were like me excited to get into the whole remote controlling your lock wherever you are especially if you are running an Airbnb business. I did, and got the smartlock and connect. After 3 months of back and forth with August Support team I have finally thrown in the towel. Here is my experience:In my first month, I had yet to install home broadband at my apartment and so I was using a spare phone to act as a wifi hotspot to link the smartlock and connect to the internet. Remote operation worked in this 1 month but not in the way that you think. Firstly, the connection at the connect may fail for no reason and although August says the connect will auto reset itself, this is simply unacceptable as you have no idea when it will reset and not when your Airbnb guest is waiting at the front door! I got an adapter which turns the connect on and off every 15 minute intervals to offset this unreliability and this worked for me although if your guests happened to have missed the 15 minute gap when it was on, they will have to wait for 15 minutes.",1,0,2016-9-20,1,4,0

"Have used the bridge for about a week now and no problems at all.Set up went smoothly, for a brief moment during set up it had trouble connecting, I was about to unplug it and plug it back in when everything lit up as food to go.

"So this thing is great. Easy to use. I’m not sure what the difference between the pro and the the other August.

"Ok so here goes another review. Hopefully this will help all users willing to dive into this lock. First I have to say that as for the Smart Lock 3rd gen goes, the unit is absolutely well built.  Super solid and installs great. The auto unlock and auto lock feature works amazing. Love it. But sadly there is always a down side. So here is the down side.1). The August Wi-Fi connect is just horrible. I connected it to the lock no problem but trying to add it to google home was just a nightmare. Added the device in google home and it did not work. Removed it from google home and tried to add it again, nothing. Did not even show up anymore but said it was successful. After hours of trying to unlink and link it in google home. I decided to reinstall the august connect from the reset to pairing it to the lock again. Bingo the device finally decided to show up in google home. Tried to contact august and spent 1.5 hours on hold with no one answering. Just gave up. There is no customer service. Be WARNED !!!!!!! you are on your own.",2,1,2018-3-19,0,1,0

"This little plug in just allows you to check your lock status while you're more than 10 feet away from your august lock. At $90 it's quite the rip off, but what can you do when you already bought the lock? It's a great tool to have to ensure you locked your door when you already left your home.Setup was a pain. Took 3 tries for it to connect to my wifi. I have a Netgear R7000, while not the top of the line router, it's still very decent. My phone has full wifi bars. Not sure why it had trouble connecting.  It's also VERY SLOW at connecting to the August lock. I timed it and it took about 30 seconds for the lock status to show up on my android app.",2,1,2017-7-24,0,7,0
"These must be made real cheap. I bought one about two years ago and it worked fine up until January when it randomly died. It was out of warranty so I bought a new one. That one worked fine up until a few days ago and now it's dead too. Considering the lock is mostly useless without this thing, it's really infuriating. I think I'm going to jump ship from August...",1,1,2020-3-14,0,3,0
"Me negaba a comprarlo porque supuestamente no se necesita si usas HOMEKIT de Apple. De pronto la conexión con Home Kit se volvió sumamente inestable y la puerta se quedaba abierta o no operaba mientras me encontraba fuera de casa y no se puede correr el riesgo de no saber si tu puerta está abierta o cerrada. Mejora mucho el desempeño de la cerradura contar con el Connect, pero su interfase con HOMEKIT sigue fallando. Si no quieres tener problemas, te recomiendo que lo añadas a tu cerradura August, lo que le quita la ventaja de no necesitarlo si usas el ecosistema Apple.",3,1,2019-6-24,0,2,0
Used this product for a year and then it stopped working.. Contacted the company (not Amazon) to get a replacement and they told me it was over a year and they would not be replacing it.. Absolutely unbelievable.. Shocking.. Then disgust.. After supporting their company and buying their products they turn their back on a valuable customer and do not replace the bridge... Am I supposed to buy a new one each year? They're outrageously overpriced so that will not be happening.. If I receive a replacement I will be very happy.. Thank you.,1,1,2020-9-7,0,1,0
"Worked okay for a few weeks, then it wouldn’t connect to my wifi anymore. Says it’s too far (it’s 3 feet away from the router, no walks or doors in between, just AIR, and 2 feet away from the lock itself). I can never guess when the connection will be lost, so I have to carry my keys all the time « just in case ». I’ve gad the thing for two years, I can’t count anymore the number of times I have done a factory reset and reconfigured the whole thing. Customer support was pretty much useless.I’m giving up.",1,1,2020-8-23,0,1,0
"Set up was simple until a got to linking the product with the August Lock. The bluetooth signal is far too weak. I could not pair the devices until I had the unit 3 feet away from the Lock. At 4 feet the device was too far in direct line of sight! Disappointed in that fact. However, in terms of functionality it worked like a charm. A little slow at times but that could be dependent on the network (I run 75mbs connection).",3,1,2017-12-12,0,1,0
"I purchased the August Smart Lock bundled with August Connect, after a year the August Connect completely stopped working.

Very disappointed.  Will be shipping this back and finding a new product.",1,1,2020-6-3,0,1,0
"The geo-lock/unlock setting is great, but you do have to tap the wifi icon on the app as you're getting close which sorta defeats the purpose of it.

"I purchased the august lock & August connect. The lock installed quick, easy & worked fine. The lock opens and closes without any issue. The ONLY problem is the lock connecting to August Connect. After several hours and days of trying to make this big investment work i realized the August support is only available to work within a US region. As a Canadian this is the only reason i can think of it not working. If this is the case, August should be more transparent with the regional availability of their product. Why even allow foreign shipping to countries that don't have support for this product? Anyways the Lock is fine but the add ons and features definitely not so much.",3,1,2019-7-15,0,0,0

"Bought this with an august lock. The over all package is expensive but it provide the exact required functionality, which is to remotely unlock my door from anywhere I want.

This thing loses connection so often it's unreal. Takes ages to connect to the lock. Majority of the time it is faster for me to walk to the door than wait for this to connect.

bought this along with their deadbolt...most unreliable product that I have used in my home automation. Previously had a schlage connect deadbolt and never had an issue. This product is supposed to detect your phone but it works 10% of the time and even when it works you are standing in front of the door for more then a minute before it will unlock.

"This is the 2nd connect I bought, I was hoping perhaps there would be a new version.Wifi performance and set up is the worst Ive seen of any product Ive used and there has been a lot. Ive spent days, using android and apple apps to bring this up. Moving my router so that is within 15 feet, viable to the device. Was able to connect via wifi once with the unit and lock right beside my wifi router just to get the configuration going. When I moved the wifi router back to a practical spot, again within visual distance of the connect, it could not pick up the wifi signal. I'm in the country so this is not a case of overlapping Wifi signals. No issues with any other device with my Wifi. This is just a very poor implementation and I'm shocked they have the nerve to release this to the public. Save your money and do not purchase. I cant believe I bought a second (which I will be returning) to try and get it to work.",1,1,2020-8-23,0,1,0

August customer support is very good but the “no questions asked here’s a new one” solution to my connectivity issues makes me believe that these are common recurring problems.

I bought this because I thought it would improve connectivity with my Smartlock. It doesn't. I still have to stand besidE my door and wait for the bluetooth to connect.

"Well let me start by saying this is a long review by someone who 99% of the time doesn't bother to write reviews. We recently bought a new home and am wanting to create a smart home ecosystem. By all popular sites this was a good product ( and ecosystem) to invest in. I am a huge tech nerd and computer geek and am well versed in tech.I purchased a Connect Hub, The Smart Lock, and the Doorbell Cam. I purchased the locks as the teenagers can often forget to lock the doors when they leave the house and I figured this would give me peace of mind that the house is always locked even when they forget. It will also unlock when we arrive home so that was pretty cool too. The Auto Lock feature worked well. The auto Unlock feature was completely nonfunctional. After spending over 90 mins on the phone with ""August Support"" they said the fault lied with the Android platform not communicating with their app and recognizing when we entered the home geofence. Not only was it not auto unlocking but when standing at the door it would take 45 seconds to connect to the lock to unlock the door! How is this faster, smarter, more efficient then using a key? IT ISNT !!!",1,1,2017-10-10,0,8,0

"Changing the review for this product. I gave a fair amount of time to test (6 months) with both iPhone and Samsung, and decided to remove this product (along with the smart lock) as it became very frustrating. Very inconsistent behavior, wait up to 1 min at the door for either the app to connect or to automatically unlock. Button to unlock will randomly freeze, need to restart the app and re-wait for the app to connect. Product does not synchronize when lock/unlock manually, which in turns jam the lock. Lock will unlock and relock for some undetermined reasons at anytime which make this product unreliable and unsafe. Very disappointing! as this product is quite expensive. I do not recommend AT ALL this product.",1,1,2017-11-9,0,0,0
"Seleccioné esta calificacion porque el producto es bueno, cumple lo que se dice y sincroniza bien con los demás productos de la compañia, el problema es que me llegó con la Caja abierta, los sellos de garantía rotos y con marcas de dedos tanto en la caja con en el producto, lamentablemente me hecharon a perder la caja para poder guardarlo, es un punto que se deberia de cuidar bien.",3,1,2017-3-23,0,0,0
