"Please whatever you do, don’t pay their ridiculous 200+ price for the same exact (NOTHING DIFFERENT) product only because they had money lying around for this exact reason. It’s sad and pathetic seeing scalpers buy things in bulk just to resell at a ridiculous product just because they have more money to spend than everyone else. It’s toxic and should be illegal.I managed to buy mine at Best Buy for my girlfriend and it’s exactly what an animal crossing fan would love, aside from not including the game, which isn’t too bad because then you can decide if you want it physical for the cover art or digital without having to worry of loosing the game.",5,0,2020-3-14,1,2,0

"Everything about the physical device, i feel like is pretty well made. Good set up, some minor future issues that are mitigated by screen protectors and similar. Several easy to work with ways to play it, kinda fun in its novelties on its build.My issue?",2,1,2019-8-23,1,1,0
"I like the Switch Console and even with its quirks, at $299 it's fairly priced and hopefully will be again when the demand goes down.  It's nowhere nearly as powerful as what Playstation and Xbox offer but it's so much more flexible that it can get away with a $300 price tag.  $450 though?  No, not worth it at all.",1,0,2020-4-3,1,9,0
The Nintendo is cool and all but I got price gouged hard on it. I promised my kid one for Quarantine. Apparently people have been buying them out to resell on ebay and Amazon. I am one of those victims.,1,1,2020-4-9,1,8,0

"This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)).So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,5,0
"man, every time the switch goes back in stock its up for like, five seconds and then goes out of stock again :) i’ve been trying to get one for the past three days and its impossible! every time i get close to ordering it, the page redirects me and tells me the item is no longer in stock. sucks but at this rate i would rather buy a regular switch than pay the bloated scalper price. which is a shame but what can you do.",1,0,2020-3-16,1,8,0
"False advertisement, I got the old version of the switch when it clearly is a picture of the new version, and it has in the dicription that it is a new version of the console. Don't waste your money on this, also they over charged me by almost 200$. If I wanted this version I would have paid a significant amount less. How have you not been sued yet. Disgusting",1,1,2020-4-7,1,6,0
"This is easily a 5-star console. I've docked 4 stars because of the scalpers though. Don't give them your money. I gave this review 1 star because I so heavily advise against purchasing this. It's worth its MSRP, not what the scalpers are charging",1,1,2020-3-19,1,5,0

Giving the console a low review because of scalpers is NOT okay. The console is beautiful and I can't wait for it to come back into stock and screw over all of the scalpers. But come on people... don't review bomb it because someone is charging way too much for it. That's not fair.,5,1,2020-3-17,1,2,1
"This is so sad to see. I wanted to purchase this for my father as this was the game that we loved many years ago on the gamecube. I thought this would had been a great present for his birthday in a time where everyone is depressed and I come and see other people, not the coronavirus, adding to peoples depression. I couldn't be more disappointed with people that somehow manage to get their hands on a mass quantity of these so they can make a disgusting profit. This needs to be outlawed.",1,0,2020-3-31,1,4,0
"I received it a couple of days earlier than expected, however one of the controllers was not recognized by the console, I followed the online directions, still nothing, ended up sending it back.  Not happy, also Nintendo fix it shop is down with the virus so they wont fix anything until this is done.  I know because when I went online to try to get it to work it was one of the notifications I got.  I have to wonder if there is any quality control, a new product that costs this much should work.",1,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0

I am a huge fan of Animal Crossing and at the last minute I decided I had to have this. I ran around and called some places. Ended up getting one of the last ones at my local Wal-Mart. The console is slick and I am not disappointed! I love the colors and I am super glad I decided to get it.,5,0,2020-3-13,1,4,0
"Wow how disappointing dont buy this until they get this improved, older version of this is better in my opinion. The newer version gave me 8+ crashes of system and game crashes leading up to finally unable to play this system having to return this system ,what a horrible experience this was. Being a big Nintendo switch player what a great disappointment this was. Hopefully they improve this newer version system to where this does not happen again or to someone else.",1,1,2019-9-7,1,5,0
"Good Seller, Console came with everything as specified on description. I'll upload some pictures so you can see the box and hardware quality.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,4,1
"This revised model of the Switch comes with a number of features that I honestly can't fully appreciate as someone who didn't own the previous model. The big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life, even though so far I haven't played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop, but they use the same amount of battery either way I would imagine. The reason I'm giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else. But I pretty much expected as much. I'm sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system, but in case you're wondering here, this one comes with the system, two gray joycons, two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller, a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller, the required cables, and the Switch dock. So you'll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an SD card for reasonable storage space, a pro controller for a more standard controller experience, maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system, an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features... just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself. This will inflate the price further, but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the Switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now. So... basically, if you want a cheaper Switch you'll want to get a Switch Lite and this one will still cost about 300 bucks like the 2.5+ year-old original variant still costs. That is, unless you want to go used. I'm only bringing up these points because while this is a great system, I do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly. Once I realize a Switch was still going to cost the same if I wanted the ability to do on and off TV play I decided I might as well just hop on board with this newer variant. I'd recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model. Otherwise, if price is a concern, wait for the Switch Lite and see how it tickles your fancy. Also, here's tip. If you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode, simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down. Also note that you cannot play on the TV off of the Switch's battery power. The dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function. I hope something in here was helpful.",5,1,2019-9-15,1,3,0
"So, I did some research and bought this switch because it is advertised as the 'NEW' model with serial number beginning with 'XKW'. It is said to have better battery life, possibly a boosted processor, and generally just be an updated switch model. That being said, the old discontinued model still retails for the same amount. I checked my model on my 'NEW AND IMPROVED' switch, and it is the sane as my 2018 switch XAW. Needless to say, I am rather disappointed in Amazon. I installed all my games, transferred data, and now I am stuck with wiping and returning it or just settling for a mediocre version of the switch. Thanks for the annoyance Amazon! Also, the left Joy-con bumper was broken right out of the box! It was also covered in grease. $300 for outdated switch, and a broken controller. I don't normally leave nasty reviews, but I'm pretty bummed. Also nintendo will switch out the outdated one, but I have to ship it to them!",1,1,2019-10-1,1,1,1
"Ordered new model (HAC-001 [01]), with better screen and battery life. Was sent discontinued model HAC-001 instead. New models serial starts with XKW, old starts with XAW. Be aware, I did my research and bought what was advertised as the updated model but got bit instead.",1,1,2019-11-14,1,1,1

A quick peak at game prices, and you'll soon realized that you've been duped by Nintendo.  Their games are ridiculously expensive.

"I wish I could give negative stars for Nintendo. This was purchased as a gift for the kids for Christmas after recommendations from some friends. I still don’t get any appeal to Nintendo? We have only had it open for 2 days and already both JoyCons are complete toast. The drift in both is so bad that you can’t make right turns playing Mario Kart. I checked the calibration and followed a number of online tutorials for things to try, but to no avail. Come to find out, there is a class action lawsuit against Nintendo for this very problem. Apparently the solution is to send the controllers to Nintendo and wait a month for them to diagnose and maybe repair them. This is probably why I haven’t thought about the brand Nintendo for almost 20 years since I last owned any of their products. I’ve owned virtually every gaming console created and never once had this issue with any other controllers. If you are so desperate to play outdated video games with Nintendo level quality that enduring this garbage is worth it to you, then more power to you.

This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability.Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it.

My grandson saved his money for almost a year to buy a Nintendo console by the time he turned 13 - and then of course --- they are nowhere to be found except for 3rd part sellers that have raised the price to outrageous levels.

Not only are several quality-of-life improvements missing, but tons of content such as the Dream Suite, Happy Home Showcases, deep sea diving, and more are absent. Why is island-visiting the only option for multiplayer when multiplayer island tours existed in New Leaf? Surely not because of hardware limitations?

"Definitely love how bright the colors are on this switch, more of a neon pastel shade. The switch is the V2, which has extended battery life and a more efficient CPU. Comparing this switch the the V1, the IPS panel has a warmer tint whereas the V1 is much brighter. Though color values do vary across switches. The joycons themselves are more of a matte finish on the coating rather than the glossy feel on previous joycons. The colors match well with the dock and will definitely stand out by your TV. The dock itself is a bit wider compared to the V1 allowing more wiggle room to prevent the switch from being scratched, though I do recommend purchasing a glass screen protector. The pattern on the back of the switch definitely gives it an ""animal crossing"" feel to showcasing. They did a really good job in making the pattern stand out compared to previous special edition switches.Overall, pretty happy with having a new switch that stands out and has a longer battery life. Will definitely be a well-used switch in the coming months.",5,1,2020-3-16,1,7,1

This is not designed with comfort in mind for handheld play sessions so the Lite may be a better option if comfort is important.  If you get hand cramps like I do, I highly recommend the Skull & Company grip case.  They also have a great travel case that you can get with it that has plenty of space for the switch with case and joycons attached and space for games, a power adapter and power bank.  It is very good quality and the Switch is dockable with the grip case attached.The switch itself has a much faster, more user friendly, prettier, less congested graphics user interface than all of Nintendo’s previous consoles.  It has a solid state drive for saving and downloading some games, and is expandable with the purchase of Micro SD cards for additional space.  The online store is easy to use and probably the best Nintendo has ever had.  Easy to sort by price, genre, developer.  It is fast and easy to use and you can sort for free games and demos too.  The load time between starting games and between cut scenes in game is very quick on hard drive, sd card, and game cartridge.  Much quicker than nintendo’s previous consoles.  I haven’t played with the joy cons detached so I can’t comment on how responsive the joycons are to movement and player interaction when joycons are detached.  The HD rumble is more subtle than on PS4 and XBox but some games have used it very well.  Mario Odyssey for example has done a great job of blending the environments in some levels to match well with the rumble feedback; its hard to explain, but this feels like the next step in controller evolution and PS5 and NextBox will be adopting a similar tech so more developers should get on board with HD Rumble in future games, hopefully.  The switch buttons have a nice click and feel like they will last, much like most of Nintendo’s products but the stick feels a little looser than the PS4.  I would like Nintendo to tighten that up for the Pro version.  Overall, this is decades of Nintendo engineering in the making which has resulted in, arguably their best console to date.  It is going to shatter console sales records for good reason.  I highly recommend this version of the Switch for the battery life, larger screen and hd rumble, but you may want to get a comfort grip if you will be using it predominantly as a handheld.  I no longer play on my 3DS because this is a much better player experience.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,6,0

"I love my Switch, this console really brings me back to my childhood, there is something about it that recaptured that magic I felt playing my Super Nintendo and even the GameCube. I've played every Nintendo console and while I was a major fan of the early ones, after the Cube, I got sucked into the Xbox 360 and then the PS4, but, this console is the first I've played in years that brings me back to that childhood magic. I got this console on a whim after watching Detective Pikachu and realizing how much I missed Pokémon games, so I had to get Let's Go Pikachu and pre-order Pokémon Shield, as well as getting back into Mario, and checking out Fire Emblem Warriors which is totally amazing. All in all, not only are the exclusive games amazing, but, the console and even the joycon controller rig are something special. I can't put my finger on it, and I really can't put it into words, but this is a great system and for kids or those trying to rediscover the child inside of them, this is a must have. Just don't try to get inside a child with this is, or you're going to jail sicko.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,9,0

Bought 2 of these for Christmas and they stopped working after 2 months. They won’t turn on. I have tried holding down the power button for 15 seconds and the release and then push it once and nothing happens. I have unplugged and plugged in the charging cord. Used different outlets.

"This review is for the Nintendo Switch w/Grey joycons, V2 HAC-001(-01). I've owned the original Switch(HAC 001) and recently, the Switch Lite(Turquoise). Battery life wasn't so good with the original Switch and only a bit better with the Lite. This Switch model has improved battery life, up to 40% depending on brightness settings, volume settings, and the type of game you're playing. Another thing I've noticed is if you download digital games, it takes less time. The graphics(colors) seem to be more vibrant.If you're a gamer who likes to play games on the T.V exclusively, this would be the perfect choice. On the other hand,",5,1,2019-12-7,1,4,1
"I couldn't believe my luck when I was able to snag one at MSRP after the release date. It's so cute! I like the design of this one much better than the other switches, and the dock is adorable, especially if you're an Animal Crossing fan. And it's the newer version with improved battery life, too! I was thinking about getting a switch for a while, but the lack of games I absolutely had to have and the colors (I'm not a big fan of the standard colors/designs) put me off. Animal Crossing solved both of these problems with ACNH and this amazing special edition.My only complaint (other than how difficult it was to get - finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than 5 minutes) is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap. It's probably just an issue with mine in particular, but it does make it kind of annoying to remove. I have to put some force into it, and I'm sure that one of these days, I'll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it. Otherwise, it's very cute, and at MSRP, I'd definitely choose it over the other colors!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,5,0

"Alright so since the Covid-19 outbreak has officially ruined my sisters senior year she had started getting into animal crossing. After playing on the I Phone app for what felt like forever she decided she wanted to transition to a game on the 3ds console. Since she had started playing animal crossing new leaf she fell in love with the series. So as her big sister I had decided I would get her this limited edition themed switch in hopes of helping with her depression as well as to cheer her up for her senior year being ruined. Also so she could get a taste of Animal Crossing new horizons for when it comes out March 20th, 2020!  The day I told her I purchased it she hopped with joy. I was excited too considering I was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister. It had finally arrived. Its box didn't come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages. It works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself. The only concerns I have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use. This is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you're trying to play a game after a year after consistant use. So I'd be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case.All I have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn't be happier with her early senior graduation gift!",5,1,2020-3-19,1,4,0
"After a little over a month of (very light) use, the hdmi connection no longer works. The switch will still charge while in the dock, but I cannot play on the TV while in docked mode.

Wait for the official Amazon restocks because they charge MSRP, now onto the Switch.Love it. I cannot say that enough.  The console won't blow you away, but it will keep you entertained for hours. Whether you play in docked mode or handheld mode, they both work very well and looks very good on both screens.  The battery on this generation is much improved over the day 1 release.  The battery itself is the same size, but Nintendo put in a more efficient processor which extends the battery life.",5,1,2020-6-1,1,3,0
"My screen was blank the first time i turned it on though I could still hear the sound of the menu.  It took a call to Nintendo to figure out how to fix it.  Not really what you expect from a $350 dollar product.  I did a hard reboot and put it in maintenance mode to fix it which only worked for a few weeks.  Now the screen is completely dead.  This really doesn't look good for Nintendo's quality control seeing that the Switch failed to perform out of the box.  Furthermore, I have had read numerous other stories online of people experiencing the same thing.  Nintendo needs to get better hardware and quality control processes.  The last Nintendo system I owned was an N64 which was a brick house and never had any problems.  The Switch just feels cheap.",1,1,2019-12-29,1,5,0
This is my first switch console. So let me start off by saying the console itself is absolutely beautiful. The design on the back is so pretty and the joycons are gorgeous as well.My biggest issue is not the console itself. But the accessories for it. I’m sure you’ve seen the terrible reviews for the joycons themselves. If you haven’t please check them out. I had done my research on them before hand and ended up buying a different controller just because I was so nervous about using the joycons. The idea is awesome. But they feel so flimsy and cheap. I hadn’t planned to even use the ones that came with the console. I planned to put them away as collectors items. But of course I had to use them to start up the console. As I was holding them I felt the plastic on the back of the right joycon move and make a loud snap. I thought I broke it and I hadn’t even done anything. I was just setting up the console. The colors may look great. But after having that as my first experience I do believe all the reviews I’ve seen for them.,4,1,2020-3-20,1,3,1

"I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,2,0

I managed to snatch a retail price Switch away from scalpers somehow.  Which took about two months of attempts to pull off!  Anyways here is my honest assessment after watching repair videos.The Switch is an excellent console at an excellent value (As long as you can obtain one at MSRP).  However being what it is the Switch itself is fairly fragile.  If your child has the self control of Angry German Kid(tm) this would not be the best gift for them.  And if playing it in undocked mode understand by all that is holy that the Nintendo Switch is not a modern smartphone.  There is no water resistance built into the design.  Submerging the switch or even spilling something onto it will likely be the end of the console.  The docking port is another point of fragility.  It won't suffer being slammed into the dock well.  All of the weight of the unit is baring down on that port while docking so being gentle and sorta gingerly easing it down is advised.  The Joycons are also rather fragile.  Not flimsy but they won't tolerate mauling like let's say a PS1 controller could take.,4,1,2020-6-22,1,3,0
"I received the newer model, as advertised and it has been great.  No complaints on the system - it's exactly what I was looking for.

"Seller deliberately did not state that the console was for sale and use in either Korea/Phillipines/Dubia as it turned out after calling Nintendo and giving them the ups code the one I received was meant for the Phillipines. I called the seller Wacky Jacky and told them what was written on the bottom of the box, he then told me to please wait a minute while he got another from his warehouse and proceeded to verify what I said then said he was sorry and that he had no idea and that his distributor assured him it was a US (North America) console. He then said I feel really bad and was going to send me a $100 gift card but what he did was refund $100 of the purchase price thinking that I would then keep the system. I don't know why he thought I would keep the system when I already had my return authorization label printed out and told him I was returning it, never did I say I wanted to keep the system. Am I supposed to believe he didn't know it wasn't a North America console when even now he has edited his listing to let any future buyers know that what he's selling isn't intended to be sold in the US. The seller asked me to please edit my review and rating but I see no reason to change the stars although I did edit this review to include the conversation with him and the fact that he did not add a note to his product description to make buyers aware of the consoles region. BEWARE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING A SYSTEM THAT IT MAY NOT BE INTENDED FOR SALE IN THE US.....

One thing I notice is the switch itself looks more premium if that makes any type of sense. Lol You can tell they fixed a lot issues with the joycons and other things. My OG switch had so many flaws.

"For quite some time Nintendo has been underwhelming when it comes to hardware specs on consoles. To the point that I switched to buying only the handhelds after the Gamecube. With the jump to an Nvidia GPU, not only does the bar for graphics get bumped up significantly from what Nintendo has released recently, it also allows third-party title developers the ability to bring their fun games to Nintendo for releases.Let's state that this isn't as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but still has very good graphics. Not only that, but being able to undock it and play it like a handheld is an awesome feature. Switch Online, a service needed for online gaming, also includes NES and SNES titles you can play for free (included in the price really). My ONE issue, is that chat is needed through an external app. If this is done so the playing experience online requires less bandwidth in the rooms and therefore is smoother on the servers, than it makes sense. Otherwise, seems a bit annoying to have to need another device for it.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,2,0

"I have an loaded opinion on this console that I want to express. The Switch is flawed. As an avid gamer who usually ends up buying all the consoles (except the xbox one) and loves the hardware behind these machines, the switch was super cool when I first heard about it and saw it. I got one not to long after release once they came back to my area. Though it took awhile to save up for any games as during that point in its life, everything was expensive on it and 3rd party devs hadn't moved to it yet. Also there were no media apps on it besides hulu which somehow is still a thing, surprising. But that isn't what I want to talk about, its more how the switch feels really damn cheap.I don't mean cheap as with the plastic shell either (but that is an issue, dislike the texture a lot, and it was also damaged by strong adhesives from dbrand before), but you get a wimpy TN panel for its main built in display, in an era where amoled and ips are very obtainable for device of this size (the original psvita was oled, so it could have been possible). As the resolution is at a solid 720p, which can help balance good enough quality on the go with actual game performance, I feel like they should have opted for a nicer quality screen to have better range of colors, would have created more vivid scenes using sharper and brighter colors. Instead they chose washed out TN panels which leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to any handheld screen semi modern hand held screen with exception of DS's which also chose awful screens. (and some might argue TN for faster response time, and to that, I highly disagree with improvements to other display types, and also for the type of audience the switch aims at)",4,1,2020-7-31,1,1,0

"I got this Gray version of the Nintendo Switch after a few months of hunting for retail price $299. There's a couple of websites out there that will notify you of in-stock. I happened to be able to grab it off of Amazon, but GameStop, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc, also have them as well. With it being in stock is rare, so you just have to look and be patient! Plan a few months ahead for birthday / xmas gifts so you have time to wait for a retail priced stock is in. Enough about the INSANE price gouging....I am very pleased with the Switch and am very happy with it. I have played on it for a week so far and everything is working fine and dandy, as it should. One gripe is that the storage capacity is small so only a few games can be played at a time, but with a micro SD card, possibilities are endless. I ordered one of those, and expect it soon so I can expand my downloaded game collection. I've enjoyed the Switch so much I'm getting some additional joycons and a grip and a charging station. I'm going to continue looking for accessories. Maybe a case I also had to get a TV adapter because my old TV only has one HDMI port, so I had to RCA to HDMI it up in order to not unplug and replug my Roku every time I want a bigger screen. How that goes is yet to be determined.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,1,0

I watched a Youtube video that also showed that the colors on the screen are more accurate and the cooling system has been improved. So if you're wanting to play Witcher 3 on here, I recommend getting this one, as that power hungry game might warp the chassis from overheating.

"On paper this is such a slick device, and combined with great Nintendo titles this was something I was excited for. BUT this system just isn't there yet. Right now I'm dealing with input lag that goes beyond controller or title specific issues. Right from the get go, setting it up (while in portable mode) felt odd. The touch screen and the attached joy-cons felt a bit slow. The input lag was the same speed as my PS4 with my TVs game mode OFF. Not a huge deal for many who will play most casual games, but annoying enough for me that titles like Cuphead and Enter the Gungeon are hindered. I do wonder if the newer portable only version doesn't have these issues, but I'm mainly interested in this as a home console.And it's online component? They still haven't caught up with Xbox Live from the 360 generation. Not a huge problem with Discord around, but still.",3,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"The switch is already of my favorite consoles I’ve ever owned. As an adult-I’ve been surprised by how much I play it in handheld mode. It’s nice to be able to sneak in some gaming time here and there at work when there is some downtime. And I actually find myself playing it in handheld mode pretty often at home when I’m watching football on the weekends. I’m glad I waited until this model with the improved battery life came out. Sometimes, I don’t have to put it on the dock to charge for 5 or 6 days, assuming I’m playing 30 minutes here and there. I highly recommend this system.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,4,0
"Okay so this is going to be a review with my overall experience. Yes, it was overpriced, I think this was worth it, I personally got it for the Joy-cons, and I don't regret it, because you really don't know when you will get the opportunity to get one for less. Anyways, arrived in perfect condition, first switch ever, the only thing that was wrong is the Left Bumper on the Joy-con, which i don't know how to explain it but kind of loose, more than the Right Bumper. It bothers me because of something on the inside, and also since I paid a lot for this switch but not enough to complain, its just something i'll have to live with. But besides that, it was a great experience, the bumper was the only thing that gave me a fright since it feels very weird. Now I don't have anything to play since my game doesn't arrive until Wednesday, but just downloading free games is fun, but originally there is only 25gb so I would recommend getting a micro SD, but i think that's all.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"This is, strangely enough, the first portable system I have ever bought in my 30+ years of gaming. I’ve actually bought 2 Switches so far. The first one was a Christmas present for my son who I was trying to ease into video games. He loves it. After him having it for a year and me occasionally playing it to help him through areas where my greater experience with games could help get through certain areas, I was tempted to get one for myself to play when I had long periods of downtime at work. When Witcher 3 came out for the switch, I bought another one for me and have been playing it a few times per week since.My experience with the console is pretty much strictly in the handheld mode. I bought a Satisfye grip and case for my switch which allows me to hold the system more comfortably than I would without it. Holding the standard system and playing for more that 20 minutes or so causes my hands to cramp. The small joycons are just too small for adult male hands to use for long without some discomfort. I’m fine with that since the small size makes the system easier for kids, like my son, to use. A regular controller can be a bit bulky for a grade school age kid to use well. With the case and grip, this system is perfect for me to throw into my vehicle at work and forget about it until things slow down when I’m waiting for a call. Then I can break it out and pass the time in style.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"The game system we received is the newer one with better battery life. However, we've been disappointed with the joys cons. Both right joy cons in the included one and another set we bought would disconnect. If you read online there are all kinds of issues with the joy cons ever since they made the system. There are fewer problems since they updated them, however, the joy cons we received with this system are dated 2017, before they updated them. So, new game system, old joy cons. Seriously disappointed in this. Nintendo is in the process of setting up a warranty repair, but I shouldn't have to do this for a brand new system. The individual set we bought is going back and we purchased new ones in a local store that should theoretically be newer. To initiate the repair Nintendo asked about a hundred questions and 2 hours later the repair is accepted. Not a good setup, in my opinion.",3,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0

"I bought this system for myself as a birthday present, and I have enjoyed using it!  The controllers took a bit getting used to detaching on and off properly.  I think the main thing is to be careful about what games you buy if the device will be worth it to you in the end, or if you are excited about upcoming games.  I waited to purchase the Switch until I knew there were about ten games I wanted to play and added about three of them into the in initial cost as well.  I’m pretty picky about my games because I am a casual gamer. Zelda breath of the wild—which I borrowed from my brother later— is more intensive than anything I have played in YEARS.Games are expensive in physical format, although that is my preference.  There are some cheaper games on the online store.  So far my favorite local game shop does not have any used copies of Switch games although they have everything else.  Maybe some day.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"Similar to other Nintendo systems, innovation is always attached to their new ideas. The joy cons are similar to the wii remotes, albeit not as precise for some games where they were used for shooting type games, the joy cons are incredible for multiplayer. I honestly prefer using one joycon whenever I can when playing games, it's really nifty being able to play two player automatically with a friend or family member without having to pay for an expensive controller, or a cheaper built one.Nintendo Apps are so-so at the moment, it would be great to have streaming apps such as Netflix for streaming, but other apps such as Youtube have worked well streaming but I do not like the interface for searching for videos.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

Glad to get one at retail price! This is by far the most fun system on the market today. If you see one for sale at $299.99 or less BUY IT! Just keep checking! That’s what I did. Try sites like zoolert (google it) to let you know when they’re in stock! I have faith in you!,5,1,2020-8-21,1,4,0
"I received a Switch that is unable to connect to the TV, so, it's pretty much just a more expensive Switch Lite.  After an insane amount of troubleshooting, I was finally told by Nintendo that the product was defective.  Nintendo wanted me to ship it in for repairs, THE DAY AFTER I BOUGHT IT.  So instead of offering me an exchange, they want me to send in my BRAND NEW SWITCH for repairs.  Kind of ridiculous if you ask me, they should have replaced my Switch no questions asked.  On top of that, Amazon is not offering exchanges either. I am very disappointed that neither company has a reasonable solution for defective Switches. I will be returning this Switch, and I can tell you, it definitely wasn't worth the headache trying to get my hands on it.",1,1,2020-6-10,1,3,0

"Our household doesn’t buy the latest, greatest gaming systems but it was time to upgrade our original Wii for another family friendly system. The reviews were pretty glowing for the Switch and I can say they’re warranted. Just make sure you buy the newer generation (this product) so you have better battery life and less decline over the life of the product.I love how Nintendo the Parental Controls essentially live within an app on the parent’s phone. A motivated kid can hack just about anything so keeping these settings non-local is a brilliant little safeguard. My kids have to ask me for “more time” when they’ve hit a daily limit (which is customizable for the day of the week). It’s very much like a simpler, more reliable version of Apple’s Screen Time feature on iPhones. Of course, you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
I can play and explore in games for 7+ hours before needing to connect to the charger.

Having access to games on the go is fantastic.  I play my Switch docked a lot as well and looks good even on my 4k TV. It doesn't have the graphic level of a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X but I find I play this more than either of those consoles.  Also from a family standpoint, the kids love playing together in Smash Bros and Mario Kart. We have a lot of fun all around with it.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
"I'm mainly going to list off the pros for this unit, something I like that they did on this generation compared to the other consoles by Nintendo and some gripes.Portability obviously with its docking capabilities - very good move.  The way the Switch locates itself within the dock is a cool party trick.  I like not having to have a rucksack full of gear just to bring my system with.",4,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
The only way Nintendo will hear is is through reviews. Limit purchases 1-2 per household. These people buying up special editions and reselling for double the price HAS to stop. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.

"I knew people who owned the Switch were seemingly all very happy with it, and I planned on getting one at some point. When Pokemon moved to the Switch, ""some point"" became ""right now"".Nintendo likes to make their consoles unique. The DS Lite had two screens, a touch screen, and a microphone that were all used to make the experience unique. The 3DS, The Wii, and Wii U also had their own interesting elements. At times, it just felt gimmicky. The Switch on the other hand, doesn't feel that way at all.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

One issue that still remains is the onboard WiFi on the console is still just as bad as it was in the first original model.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,5,0
Turned on the console for the first time and immediately received error code 2002-4153. I called Nintendo Support and I have to send it to their repair service.

"The Wii and Wii u were cool consoles, but i really only used them to play like mario, or gamecube games on, they were never really used to play ""wii games"". well the switch completely turns my opinion of nintendo consoles around. I have a gameboy advance, and still play the old pokemon games on it from time to time, but the switch is so much more than that. Its like combining all of the good things about a wii, a gameboy advance, and even an old n64, and packing it all into one box, that can even be taken on the go.I am super excited to own one, and i cant wait for more switch games to come out, BOTW, lets go eevee, Smash, the upcoming pokemon sword, and mario odyssey are my definite favorites.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,3,0

"The only time I’ve used a Switch has been playing on one that my friends own. Just these experiences has really intrigued me into getting my very own Switch. I love playing video games and I own an Xbox and PS4, so I figure at some point it was time to complete the trifecta. While I’m more of an Xbox person, I will say I am very impressed by the Switch. It is a very simple console, but genius in of itself. I’ve had some Nintendo gaming devices here and there. A SNES back in the day, but mostly their portable ones from the Gameboy to the Advanced to the DS and 3DS. The Switch combines that of a home console and a portable gaming device and for that I love it. I can put it in the dock and play it on my TV. I can play it handheld which will be great for road trips or maybe just wanting to play anywhere. This was a brilliant move by Nintendo and it makes the Switch really stand on its own.Now what I’d say my favorite thing about the console is it’s simplicity. This device is made for one thing only and that is for playing video games. The console is both modern and old school at the same time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who really likes Nintendo and their games.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"The switch is a very nice system, read the reviews of wobbly joy con’s which there are many of but figured what are the chances I get one with that issue, Ordered it as a christmas gift, arrived on time the week before, christmas day, present gets opened and of course the joy con is wobbling, not enough to come loose but enough that it would definitely preoccupy while you play. Not for nothing but nintendo is getting to dollar, offering the worst deals on the switch and with the switch being it’s big hit , still can’t have quality control, the switch should feel as solid as a tank, not cheap when the joy con wiggles right out if the box and nintendos policy for fixing their mistake in my particular right out if the box defect is that they might send you a replacement which might be the plain grey/black instead if the colored joy con that I paid for is imo,a disgusting business practice, way to stand by their flagship product and instantly  turned me into a never by another nintendo product for anyone person.

I called Amazon, at which time they let me know that I surpasses my warranty on the item.  I immediately was disappointed and than immediately relieved for the next thing the Amazon representative told me was that I was going to be able to receive a $340 refund of the 399 i spent on the item.  After 30 months, if you tell me that I would receive almost a full refund after my warranty had run out... I am still in shock.Now as for the Switch itself... We love it.

But only till after the return date passed did I realize, the game card reader was broken! When I first played one of the games it seemed to work fine. But later when I removed the game and I inserted it again, it told me it couldn’t read the game card. Easy enough, just restarting the switch made it read. But now months have past and the only game card it seems to read is animal crossing. All my other games just wont read. Even a brand new copy of Minecraft. Since I believe I still have warranty, I wanted to contact Nintendo for repairs but it’s been shut down due to COVID. I hope I can get this fix. I’m very disappointed.",3,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0

"Playing switch games is great, i bought 5 games with my system for variety. Turns out the most amazing feature i was not aware of before i started playing. The online subscription they offer for a measly 20 bucks a year offers a library of nes and snes games you can play at will. You can save state in them as well up to 4 save files for each game. You can ALSO reverse time when playing (it is a cheap feature but VERY cool still) Died in mario, just hold in two buttons, reverse the game like a dvr on tv show and bam, try that part again right where you just were!! i do not know if it is true but i read they have two more slots for future classic systems in their coding in the system. We have Nintendo 8bit, Super Nintendo but we could see Nintendo 64 or game cube in the future as well.All 5 games i picked up for it run great as well, no complaints except it was 150 dollars more than list price.

The seller was also very helpful and the switch arrived much earlier than expected and on my birthday, coincidentally.

I shouldn’t have had to pay double or more for this switch but I did. And luckily I had enough but others may not and it makes me feel bad. It would’ve been nice to pay the original price or at least make it more of an affordable price. Or not just bought it and sell it for more and let others have the actual chance of getting one in stores or online when it came out. If you have the money for this and if you’re a big fan of animal crossing I would say that this is something to do but I wish this was for affordable for others who may be fans of animal crossing as well and don’t have this much money to spare.,3,1,2020-4-6,1,2,0

Will try to send it to Nintendo for repair, but I am absolutely unhappy about this. And you can imagine how my 7 year old son feels...",1,1,2020-1-9,1,3,1
"This is my first game console. I like how it is small and light for easy carrying around. But the games are really expensive, like a Mario party game is $59. I think they probably do not make much money from the console but they make a lot of money by selling the games. You can easily pay more for the games than the console itself. I also bought this for my little kid but it turned out that there is barely games for little ones.",3,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0
"Factory, but the $30 reward/rebate was obviously a scamazon issue. Shoulda bought it at target, a retailer at least will qualify the $30 rebate. And acknowledge it actually existed.  Class action anyone?",4,1,2020-1-4,1,3,0
"compre la switch por Amazon.com Services LLC y al momento de conectar al televisor no funciona y al reclamar la garantia me indican que no pueden hacer nada. Tenia fe de que al comprar por aca tendria mejor soporte y aseguraba una compra de calidad pero no, viendo que ahora me toca quedarme con un nintendo defectuoso hubiera preferido pagar casi el doble en alguna tienda de electrodomesticos donde si aplicaria la garantia sin ningun problema.

"I travel often for work, so needed something to do in hotels and long flights. The Switch hits the mark. This newer version has great battery life, i never had the old one with the shorter life, but no complaints on this one.I immediately jumped in with the old NES and SNES games you can get by subscribing to the online platform. They look great and play great. Also have been playing Link's Awakening and Super Mario Odyssey, beautiful games and looking forward to more.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0
Fantastic Console! Nintendo truly knows how to design a solid gaming console from the portability of the Switch and being able to play it on the TV. What I love about the Switch is the games are actually full length instead of the shorter and more casual games on the 3DS.  The games are expensive but the PS4 and Xbox were too when they first came out. The Switch is still a fairly new console and a lot of great ports are coming to it.  I always look out for deals and end up with games for $40. Overall I truly am enjoying the Switch being an owner of a PS4 Pro and Xbox One S.,5,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0
"This was my first hand held gaming device and I think it is a very unique, innovating what a portable console should be. I love the portability of it on the go and the ability to allow multiple players play at once. For $300 I think this is a solid gaming console that can be used to pour hundreds of hours into and still find games refreshing. The Nintendo game lineup also has the best exclusives out of the other competitors, from Mario to Zelda to Animal Crossing, there’s a game that suits anyone’s taste. Of course there are improvements to be made such as the joycons being small and sometimes uncomfortable in the even if you put it in together like a controller, it still doesn’t replace the feeling of a real full sized controller. In the future, I would just like Nintendo to make the portable screen 1080p with a 120hz refresh rate for an even better gaming experience. But overall, with its creativity and innovation still standing strong 3 years later, there isn’t much you can’t love about the Nintendo Switch.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,1,0

Honestly as much as my wife loves this thing its not worth it. Ours came with the game code and it doesn't work and the seller won't work with you even after showing the proof. The code does not work. Yes it says game doesn't come with but the one they sent does....that tells me they bought in bulk without knowing what they bought then maked it up...karma is a b****.,1,1,2020-7-15,1,2,1

"I really wanted to be able to play video games while I was at work. I am a doctor and some nights just are slow since I work ER/Overnight. This was the easiest route for me to have the ability to game. Only issue I would say is the fact you need a capture card if you want to share with your friends via discord. Other than that, its easy to set up with TV/Just use with joycons. Accessories are expensive and so are games so I suggest figuring out exactly what you want and looking for sales etc. Also google how to make sure you are getting the new model since they are selling the old model with the same name. Theres a few things you can do to ensure you are getting the newest!",5,1,2019-12-12,1,1,1

The battery life on the new consoles is much better than the previous model which is great. I gave my old model to my three-year-old who loves playing this console as much as I do! Every morning, the first thing he says when he wakes up is ""Can I play my game?"" So it really is a great console for all ages! Would buy again and again!!",5,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0

"If you’re willing to wait, Amazon occasionally gets some, and puts them up at regular price.  Received mine much sooner than their initial estimate. As for the console... it’s fun, everyone knows that. Great first-party games, and a nice selection of third-party games. Okay battery, unusual but feature-packed controllers, and a tiny bit uncomfortable for extended play in handheld mode. Less powerful than its competitors, but ray tracing does not a good game make.Just do everyone a favor and don’t pay a scalper for the console. That’s the only way to choke them out. Stay patient and check multiple stores, regularly. Eventually you’ll find one at the proper price.

"I already own a Switch but wanted to pick one up for my fiancee to have fun during quarantine. She is someone who has never played video games and didn't like them on the few occasions I tried to play a multiplayer game with her. Managed to pick up a used one (that looked virtually new) from Amazon Warehouse for about $240, which was a steal. She is really enjoying it and slowly becoming a regular gamer (1-2 hours a day), and the Switch has several games that are great for newcomers. She prefers handheld mode while I almost exclusively play it on my TV, so having that option is awesome.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"A Nintendo Switch with extended battery life? What's not to love? It's a no-brainer! Nintendo is always at the forefront of console innovation and they didn't miss a beat with the Switch. Want to play a game on your tv like a traditional console? Drop the Switch into the dock and game on in 1080p HD. Need to hit the road? Slide the Switch out of the dock and continue your gaming on the go in brilliant 720p HD. And I haven't even gotten into the built-in option for multiplayer gaming with the removable controllers. Like I said, cutting edge console innovation from Nintendo! Come for the innovative console, stay for the myriad of both cutting edge and nostalgia-inducing first party titles from Nintendo. Not into Mario and Link games? How about the largest library of quality Indie games and old-school games? No matter how you look at it, the Switch is where it's at!",5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0

It alerts you the minute there's Switch stock and you just have to be quick enough to buy it. It may take a few times and a few clicks but I was eventually able to purchase mine and I love this thing! It's really helped me curb boredom. I hope this helps anyone and please don't buy a Switch from any of these 3rd parties jacking up the price.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,2,0
"I've been wanting a switch for a long time, and finally managed to get my hands on one close to MSRP (at $307) during the pandemic. I only have one game on it so far, but to say I'm pleased and impressed so far is a bit of an understatement. It's nice to be able to play on my TV in the living room, and when someone else wants to play their own game or watch Netflix, I can just take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode, but stay in the same room and socialize. I like being able to bring the game into my room and not be forced to play it in the living room if I don't want to deal with all the noise.It's pleasant to hold, with just a bit of weight to it to feel sturdy. The Joycons are nice to the touch, although the sticks are a little too 'smooth' for my liking so I put some grips on. I haven't experienced any drift, yet, but it's only been a few days. They're very satisfying to hold, and even more satisfying to click into place on either the tablet or the included joy-con grip. I haven't tried the straps yet.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,1
"One of the joycons is a little weird but like, wow!! My little animal crossing machine is working really good to let me keep my mind off this whole quarantine thing!! I've had it for a few weeks now and my friends were wondering if I died.Not many downsides, There's lots of games to play on here since the switch has been out for a while and it doesn't even have to be connected to a tv to let you play. If you know a kid who loves video games but you don't want your 9 year old to get shouted at for being bad at video games by 20-somethings that want to win games after work, this little guy doesn't have voice chat so you don't need to worry.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"I kept checking and FINALLY was able to find a Switch for retail. Thank you Amazon!  We have a couple games so far.  Animal Crossing New Horizons, super smash bros, and Mario Kart 8.  I love how Nintendo is more parent friendly games, you don't have to worry about the games your kids are playing on Nintendo Switch so much compared to say games on other consoles with adult ratings and such.. Love that most 2 player games can be played with one joy con, (although a second joycon is on our to buy list)  the reason being is adult hands holding half a joycon is kind of hard.  If you can grab one at retail and are in the market, i'd say go ahead and pull the trigger.  If you can't find at retail, i'd suggest just waiting it out until you can. :)",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"The switch is honestly the perfect console. Being able to easily transition from a portable console on the go to a docked console connected to your TV is everything I wanted. When I am tired and no longer want to sit at the TV and play, I grab it and jump in bed and just continue. My only issue is quite technical: the resistance of the Joycon controller buttons is too high. Takes too much effort to press them down. I got a pro controller and the difference is astounding. I don't understand why the Joycons don't have ""soft"" buttons like the pro controller does.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0

You can play classic with it hooked up in a dock and connected to the TV (console is very small which is great), or you can put the joy cons on the console and play, of you can play with it looking like a old Nintendo 64 controller or x box/playstation controller. It's also touch screen!",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"The switch is a great game system but my blue joy-con broke within a couple days of playing with it. It was very disappointing as I bought it for my son’s birthday so I waited about a month before giving it to him. Of course, that meant I could not return it once the controller broke. We had planned a big road trip and I was hoping the switch would keep him entertained but because of the broken controller, it was useless the whole time. Nintendo has a warranty on it, but being holiday season I haven’t gone through their “process” of returning it and getting a new one. All I can say is its been a very disappointing experience with this Nintendo product delivered by Amazon. Just sucks something so expensive can break so easy.",3,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0
"When I was little I used to be able to spend all day playing games. Of course as I got older, my amount of free time decreased exponentially. If, like me, you need to balance your job and college life but still want to play games, this console is a really great choice. It's loaded with tons of pick-up-and-play games that are great for quick 30 minute sessions. The handheld mode makes it really accessible and portable, and the new model has a great battery life. My only big complaint is that the controllers when in handheld mode don't always feel securely attached to the sides of the console. There is a small amount of wiggle if you move the console that is not really enough to bog down the experience, but is still noticeable enough to feel sort of cheap. Overall though this is a great console for a busy young adult still trying to find time for their favorite hobby and I highly reccomend it if you're interested.",4,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0

The overall design, especially Nook and the Nooklings on the dock, is so cute and the pastel colors for the Joy-Cons, like all other Joy-Con colors, look so much better in person.

You do need to make a Nintendo account, though, if you don't already have one in order to play on it, but overall set up was easy and didn't take too long.

I did my research and moved it to an open air location and even at one point had a floor fan pointed directly at it with no success. Do not buy this product.",1,1,2020-7-8,1,2,0
"I’ve had my Switch for about a year now and I can say it’s a very fun console. It’s no where near as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox but the fact that I can take my games on a road trip or play it at home is pretty awesome and convenient for gamers. The Joy-Cons do get loose however over time and will slide off without having to press the release button so I would recommend getting a grip or a case like the picture shown above. Another thing I wan to mention is the joy con drift, which can get really annoying at times. Having to calibrate them in the settings menu every other minute can be really annoying and for others, ruin the experience. I usually use a pro controller while playing on docked mode and I don’t run into any issues but the problem persists when I’m playing on table top or handheld. Besides the minor inconvenience here and there, I think the Nintendo Switch is great, especially with third party games like Skyrim or the Witcher 3 being ported over to the Switch. It’s a great little console.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1

"There are not many games worth playing on the Switch. If you have kids your probably ok but as an adult, I quickly got tired of Animal Crossing. Legend of Zelda is good, but there is not much else besides 7 different Mario titles and Super Smash Bros. My take: don't get this system unless you really like the nostalgia of these older franchises or have kids.",3,1,2020-6-19,1,1,0
"I thoroughly enjoy the size, versatility, and portability of this product! Easily one of the best handheld devices ever manufactured. Nintendo has completely out classed their competition with this wonderful piece of machinery that is guaranteed to have you busy for hours. And this is coming from a die-hard Sony fan :). The sleek but comfortable design of the joycons makes intense gameplay surprisingly seamless. Their massive game selection ranges from AAA titles, to RPGs, First Person Shooters, and MUCH MORE. There is so much more that could be said, however, it’s too much to type! Lol. If you’re looking for an excellent game console that you can play either casually or continuously, look no further. Additionally, if you’re like me (frugal) and you’re on the fence about shelling out the money, don’t be; it’s worth every penny. Also, this seller moved my shipping up to one day shipping FOR FREE!!! Literally the BEST SELLER I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Would definitely order from this seller again. Do yourself a favor and buy the switch!",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"The product is fine and the shipping was fast.  However, the box was not sealed which indicates that somebody opened the box.  I ordered this to make sure and get the newer switch with the longer battery life and also to get another dock.  I have not done so yet, but I will be checking to make sure that somebody did not switch an old switch of the new switch in my ""brand new""  open box.  It seems quality control was lax here.",4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
Switch (main screen portion) was warped upon receipt. The back side slightly bulged out while the screen side was concave and bent inward. I’ve never seen this issue before on another Switch. Didn’t realize this problem until a few days after receiving when I was installing a screen protector on the Switch. Set up a return and replacement of the Switch through Amazon. I assume this issue is simply a manufacturer defect and hope the replacement doesn’t have the same problem.,3,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"Very Impressed with the depth of this special edition, In the past, the previous Special Editions have been cool, But I feel this one surpasses them all, The two-tone Joy-Cons are great, As is the Dock and backplate. The Joycon holder is about the same as other switches, Just a basic black. But Everything else is great!",5,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0
"I bought this for my younger sister as a Christmas present, along with Zelda BoTW and a SanDisk drive. She loves it!! I love how intuitive it is to learn the controls, she had the hang of it in no time, and being able to play looking at the switch screen OR play looking at a monitor/TV is soo nice. The battery life is great too, it charges perfectly fine with a portable charger, or wall charger. Cannot wait to see what Nintendo brings us in the 2020s.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"The coronavirus shortage is incredible. I  searched everywhere for 2 months and didnt want to pay the markup from third party sellers who were going for $500. I finally was able to order from amazon for $299.99 but on a 8 weeks delay. I placed the order and to my surprise it came in less than 2 weeks. Now on the console itself i give it 5 stars even though i wish it had more built in memory. My kid loves it. It's portable, so you can take it anywhere. The online gaming ecosystem though is build to milk you like a cow so one less star for that. Like most/all games are exclusive  and very expensive.",4,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I come from PC and PlayStation gaming. The guys at work all talked about the switch and convinced me to get one. I got to say it's really cool. Great screen and very portable. Games library is not huge, but enough to be worth it. The hardware is not a powerhouse, but it doesn't need to be for these games. I wouldn't play Skyrim on it, or make it my only system, but it is a great addition.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"Good battery life, nice screen. The kickstand is very flimsy, and the dock is way too large to be portable.Grip is the worst thing about this system, both when using it in handheld mode and a single joycon.",4,1,2019-11-9,1,1,0
"Our 4-1/2 year old loves it!!  We knew she was a little young for it but she needed something to fill a little time during the day.  She stays busy doing activities and school type work but she needed some downtime that wasn’t just watching TV.  This is perfect.  Paw Patrol game was perfect for her to start learning how to play video games.  Since then, she has graduated to a Yoshi game that has her problem solving.  She only spends about 30-45 minutes On it a day, total.  We also downloaded some coloring books and puzzle games.  She loves those.  Highly recommend but watch the screen time.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"I finally found a new Nintendo Switch on Amazon. I wasn’t happy how the price for a basic gray one was double the price, but I hoped for that price everything would be working perfectly. It was brand new in the original box and wrapping. Unfortunately, both joy cons have an issue with on button that it doesn’t work everytime you press the B and Down button.",4,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"I didn't think I'd like the switch after buying one for my son and seeing him play it. He said he liked it and I was still stuck on my WiiU.  However, I'm loving it right now! I love the handheld game that you can take with you if you would like and I love the console that I can play on my big if I'd like a. The only drawback is the little controller holder is quite small said sometimes uncomfortable if you play for extended periods. Other than that, I haven't found a flaw :)",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
Love this! I hate video games yet I have played and actually enjoy it! I bought for my 12 year old daughter but had to buy 2 more controllers as my 3 and 4 year old boys play as well! Didn’t think they would be able to but they love it and actually comprehend how to play! Great game for the family and for all ages! Little kids and adults! Even my mom (grandma) played along!,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

"Absolute blast of a system. It is a genius design and the games are fun. I love table top mode where I can play Super Smash Brothers with other people or Mario party. It is a 3 in 1. A home console for the TV, a portable gaming device, and mini TV in itself. Not the most powerful console but it is definitely one of my favorites due to its features, comfort, and games.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"The Nintendo Switch that I purchased arrived today and unfortunately, was returned today due to it being defective. It was advertised as a Nintendo Switch in brand new condition. However, the error code that displayed on the screen upon turning it on indicated otherwise. I called Nintendo to troubleshoot, but the switch was so defective that while trouble shooting it completely shut off and wouldn’t turn back on – not even to display the error code. The Nintendo representative assumed that I had this switch for quite some time because these are issues that any “brand new” switch shouldn’t have.",1,1,2020-6-9,1,1,1
"I didn't want to buy this for my kid.  I thought the wii u he had was just fine.  But when Christmas rolls around and your kid begs...glad we bought it.  It's fun, versatile, and works great.  I made him hook it up to a tv so he isn't staring at a super small screen.  His friends come over and bring their switch and they play together.  He can bring it over to a friends house which is pretty cool.  Great buy.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"So, I honestly wasn't sure whether I should buy this or not since I've never played an Animal Crossing game before New Horizons. However, it has quickly become my most played game on the switch and it is so awesome to be able to play it on a system that looks this gorgeous. I don't know if this will go back in stock but I would recommend this to any Animal Crossing fans out there. My favorite part is definitely the island etchings on the back!Do not support scalpers!! I bought this system for $300 dollars and scalpers are out there trying to sell it for more than twice of the MSRP! If no one buys from them they will have no choice but to lower the price to a more reasonable level.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
Received it Saturday which was super fast considering all that’s going on. My dtr played it the whole weekend. She loves it! She wanted a grey but received a color one. They sent a card of apology and $10! So thoughtful. She was happy just to get one cause they are all gone in the store. A little pricey but we all pinched in so should could have it. Worth it!,5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"Really well designed, sturdy and very fun to play solo or with my wife and kid. Mario Kart 8 I think we are up to now and loads of nostalgic fun. I 3d printed handheld controller grips for when we use the joycons for two players separately! Much more comfortable with big hands than holding the single joycon sideways. Really happy all around with the Switch.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
Absolutely perfect!  Sure it was overpriced and all that but it’s worth every single penny!  I wanted this so bad and they were sold out everywhere. Glad a found one from a reputable store that arrived fast. I’m spending the next few months of quarantine building my animal island!,5,1,2020-8-21,1,1,1
"Finally found one used one night at 2am and bought it. Was listed as acceptable condition, but the system and accessories looked like it was in ""Like New"" condition. Been wanting one, but all these price gougers were making it impossible. So far so good. I haven't had any issues that I've seen with the Switch itself. Only thing I have noticed is that there is already joy con drift on the right joy con. Absolutely worth the wait for the right price. Me and the family are really enjoying it during the quarantine.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"This is my second Nintendo switch for my 2 kids. They get to play together at the same time either on TV or on the switch itself in seperate room. One thing that really makes me upset is the digital/download games. You can't download a game in one console (primary) and download the same game in the other console (different profile/account). Nintendo might have found a loophole to prevent losing more money by forcing people to buy second game for second console. Every game must be purchased two times for both Switches if they want to play together. Overall, Nintendo Switch console is worth it.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0

"Long story short, 17 years ago, my mom sat on Animal Crossing for the Gamecube and played 8 hours straight until she got the gold statue before me. I was 15 years old, and upset.So when this console came out, I bought it for her as her reward for beating me all those years ago.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"AMAZING! Iv been wanting a Nintendo switch for a whole Nile now because my older brother just got one and I wanted to be able to play with him since I haven’t seen him in a while. The problem was that all these sellers are taking advantage of this pandemic to make an extra few bucks. THANK YOU AMAZON for not price gouging. I was able to get this switch for the regular 300 dollars and I received it sooner than I expected! I would give it 6 stars if I could. A little note, the red Joy-Con seems to be a little more neon pink than red which I personally love! But I’m pictures it comes out looking red which is funny. Loving my switch so far!!!",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,1
You have the catch amazon because the prices change consistently! After checking 3 times a days for a week i finally caught the price at original price! I received mines today. Brand new. Newer model (-01). Very happy! Shipping was first estimated to be in Oct and after a week my switch was shipped out.,5,1,2020-8-14,1,1,1
"Pretty disappointed with the fact that I could find game sold separately anywhere in the sale s ad, so I assumed due to the huge price tag and the fact that animal crossing is all over the box that it came with it. Very unhappy! I feel purposely mislead.",2,1,2020-8-20,1,3,0
"This thing is Awesome, its a portable handheld and home console....its so much fun. I am currently playing the legend of Zelda and the graphics are so nice.

"Haven't own a Nintendo console since the Wii. I really wanted something I could play bowling, tennis, Mario etc and after finally pulling the trigger I can say 100% I'm in love with the Switch. My wife and I play every single night and it's great to bring on trips. I wish it was easier to travel with and you didn't need the dock and could just use a USB-C to HDMI but other than that even if you're a casual gamer this is a must have.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I took a break from gaming consoles before I got this. My last home system was a PS3 and my last handheld was a Nintendo DS. I couldn’t find any games I was really into or anything that seemed worth my time. I got the Switch after having seen my friends using it and after a few minutes of playing Breath of the Wild. Let me tell you.... this system is wonderful!! You’re really getting two systems in one!! Being able to play on the go as well as just plug and play is such a wonderful concept. Not to mention the game options and variety. I’ve played over 70 hours of Breath of the Wild, and loved it. The other indie games available are also great additions. Overall, it’s a great system. Worth every dollar. I haven’t had this much fun with a gaming system in a while. Great job, Nintendo!!!",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"Everything is in perfect order when it arrived. Though I didn’t know it would have to be charged upon arrival. Was looking forward to playing it as soon as everything was hooked up to the television, but I had to use handheld mode which made it die while setting up! Minor gripes aside, it’s a great console. We all know this. $20 for the worst online gaming service on the market is a bit much for me though.",4,1,2020-3-10,1,1,0
"This console is beautiful! I'm not a huge Animal Crossing fan but the new game did catch my eye even more when this Switch was announced. The pastel colors really work on the Switch, along with the design on the back. What really tempted me to buy this specific one was that it is the second version of the Switch. Which of course includes better battery life. I'm sure you've heard this all before, so I won't go any longer. It's a very pretty console and if you have your chance to get your hands on it for the normal market price. I'd suggest that you go for it!",5,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
Great Christmas present for a 4yr old. I tested it before wrapping it and putting it under the tree and everything was setup perfectly. I could not be happier but the price was a little steep but it’s is what it is. I bought it because my 4yr old asked for it and I spoil him and he already has an iPad MINI but he wanted a switch because his cousin has one. Go figure! So far so good! I hope it lasts a long time for him.,5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"My switch came in a lot earlier than I was expecting it to so I am over the moon with that! Not to mention that it came in perfect condition (I bought it in New condition but was feeling a little suspicious about it, not going to lie) Everything is working wonderfully right now so I really can't complain at all about the product itself. I definitely paid WAY too much for it (over $500 with tax) but if you're looking for a switch now in this quarantine time, you'll know there's a serious shortage of available consoles. All in all, definitely recommend buying if you're as impatient to get it as I was.",4,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"I bought this just to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and it didn't disappoint in the least! It's incredibly fun!One cool feature is that if you set up Parental Control using the free app, it will tell you how long you've played each day. Since I'm neither a parent nor do I need to be controlled, I disable restrictions and play-time limit so it doesn't actually interfere when I'm playing, but it is a bit sobering to see that yesterday I played for 6 hrs and 40 min.",5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"I love my Nintendo switch! With new ones not being available I saw this used/open box one on there and thought it was worth a shot. I feel like I really scored on this one.

So if you need one and see a used Prime one available, go for it, for the price you can’t go wrong...",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"I bought this Nintendo Switch from this Seller. It was an Extra $145.00 than the original Retail Price of $300.00, but I believe that was because of the Switch Shortage that happened everywhere due to COVID-19. The actual Product I received was top notch though. It was packaged very well. I didn't have a problem opening it which I have had with some other Products which actually lead to me accidentally damaging those items. But no such problem here. The actual Switch itself was also in perfect condition. No scratches anywhere on any of it. And nothing was missing. It runs perfectly fine too. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. I am very happy with it. The only downside, like I said, was the Price, but is understandable given the Pandemic and Shortage. So I'm giving this Five Stars. Great job!!",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I’ve had a Nintendo Switch before, but I just replaced it and it came today! No damage was done to the console or any of the accessories inside as I got it out. Feels just as I remember it. I’m sooo excited to be playing Zelda again! The only thing I was unhappy about was that the delivery guy didn’t follow instructions I left to knock and ring doorbell. It was also raining and the step he left the packages on were getting wet. So I spent $320 on this just so it could have potentially gotten ruined if I hadn’t seen the truck or got a notice it had been delivered. Other than that, I love it!!! Highly recommend!!!",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"I've been looking to get a Switch for a while and thought that I had missed out due to the limited pandemic stock.

We tried to use three different microSD cards (even the ones manufactured by Nintendo) to add more memory, but none of them worked. Formatting wasn't even an option. We kept getting error messages. I scoured the internet and used every troubleshooting option to no avail. We have only been able to use this Switch very minimally and is now being repaired by Nintendo since it is still under warranty. Also, because of a back up in repairs (due to Covid-19) we won't have it back for a couple months. Wish I could give it a raving review.",3,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

"Here is an actual product review, not an opinion on the sellers business ethics. To start, I bought this solely because it's the limited edition version. It does not come with the animal crossing game however, so keep that in mind. The product is exactly as advertised and was completely new and unused. Absolute perfection. The price is not ideal, but Amazon has amazing financing options. So overall it's a beautiful device and so very cute. I definitely don't regret buying.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,1,1
"-1 Star because I hate price gougers, and I normally wouldn't ever support them for something like this, but I was behind the bus on the news about the release on this switch edition and decided if I was going to spend more on it I'd rather do it while it's still reasonable seeing as I was already spotting $700 ones which is outrageous. On another note the item came in pristine condition and as expected is very cute.",4,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"The perfect console for all ages. Having grown up with Nintendo consoles, this system brings back my fondest memories with an innovative twist. I love the “switch” capability of being able to pick up the console right from the dock without interrupting the gameplay. There are so many fantastic titles exclusive to the Switch, which makes for many hours of nonstop enjoyment. This is one of Nintendo’s best systems yet, and I’m excited for what’s to come next.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"Nintendo exceeded my expectations with this console, the portability, the quality of the games, the graphics and everything else about it is so great that you wouldn't be able to find any of these things on any other console, I've only played a few hours on Nintendo switch's exclusive games like Mario Odyssey or breath of the wild but even by playing 2 hours with these games you can see how much effort and care went into these games, especially with Mario odyssey.I can't recommend this console enough.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0

I found the switch a great alternative to a number of things he COULD be doing.... drugs, drinking, thuggery.  Although at 18 I’m thinking a job might be a good idea.  Hard to find work when your skills include; gaming, cuteness, extremely tall, did I mention the gaming?  Anyway, at least this keeps him at home, safe and out of trouble.  😉",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Happy with the product.  This is the revision with the improved battery life, which is a noticeable improvement.  It also has slightly higher brightness and truer color compared to the past model due to a display upgrade.

"I'm satisfied with this, nothing crazy about it.  Doesn't come with the game or anything like that, just some extra decorations.  It costs the same as a normal switch retail so you can't be mad.  If you're an animal crossing fan I would definitely purchase this, if you're not, just go for the normal one, as the special edition is selling over the price of a normal switch on the second hand market.  Works great and as expected from a Nintendo product.",4,1,2020-3-22,1,1,0

I do suggest getting a screen protector though if you plan to use it as a handheld device. You can find a 3ok for under $10 on Amazon",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"I pretty much like the console. In portable mode, the ergonomics are quite good and the controls fall naturally under the fingers. The buttons are quite small and close together but you get used to it very quickly.  In Salon mode, nothing special, the console defends itself well, and the graphics are excellent for a console of this range.  A quick note on the parental control application which is also very practical and which lets you know how long players are using the console per day. Only one regret, however, the daily limit of playing time applies to the operation of the console and not to the time per player. Difficult to enforce equity between mhy childrens. Apart from that, excellent console.",4,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
This saved me from going crazy in quarantine.  I bought this right before it all happened and this is all I do to keep my mentally okay.  I virtually see my friends and change my island constantly with Animal Crossing.,5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
I've been putting off buying a Nintendo switch for myself until they made an animal crossing game for it. It turns out that my patience has paid off! This is one of the most aesthetically pleasing special edition consoles in my opinion. The pastel colors on the side and the off white color of the base gives it a nice tropical and island vibe. The details on this are amazing as well! They even go as far as to make little islands on the back of the tablet iself. I am completely satisfied with this and more!,5,1,2020-5-24,1,1,0
So I love my switch for game nights but this day in age given what phones can do I struggle to think this is worth price. Couple that with how expensive games are this just makes it even harder to justify getting it. In hindsight I definitely regret investing in the price of the unit and the high cost of the games. The games in my note 10 are just as good.,3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"I was not a believer. I'm a PlayStation guy...have been since PS1. Finally broke down and scooped up a Switch. This thing is a game changer. I never thought I would WANT to play a game in bed. Now I can't stop. Being able to play on my big screen TV and then continue the game anywhere else is something I never knew I would enjoy doing but it really is amazing. And the amount of exclusive titles seals the deal - Breath of the Wild is one of the best games ever made, Smash Bros Ultimate and Mario Kart are perfect for big groups hanging out.It's worth every penny.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"Exactly as we expected. Packaged in a brand new box. My family has enjoyed this system more than any of the others that we've had. It's been pretty easy to setup accounts, implement parental controls,  and even purchase games. The portability is probably why it's used more than any other system.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
This looks so cute and soft. I love it very much.Works fine. Currently waiting for the game so I cannot say much about battery life and performance of the console in general. But I guess it will be fine.,5,1,2020-3-20,1,1,1
This is the cutest console I’ve ever laid eyes on. I have a couple of other special edition systems in my house but none of them were so adorably on brand for me as this one.It’s your typical switch. I’m happy with it. The Animal Crossing detail on the back was a fun addition to this one. I’m glad I was able to snag one on release day!,5,1,2020-4-1,1,2,0
Bought this for the Mrs. for an early Christmas present directly from Amazon. It is the new version with extended battery life. We’ve been taking turns playing Breath of the Wild for hours on end. No complaints whatsoever. Except maybe that I prefer my Xbox controller which can work on it with the Brooks adapter (also on Amazon).,5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"The system came new, packaged great. No issues. Perfect condition and playability. We have been Nintendo buyers since the beginning. We like the family-friendly games that Nintendo offers.

"A tremendously well designed platform for gaming. I do wish it had more educational abilities so I could blend both education and gaming for my nephew.

"We are thrilled with our Nintendo Switch. We got Animal Crossing, which I can play online with my daughter (I can visit her island and she can visit mine).

Nintendo Switch is just what I thought it would be! Straight entertainment out of the box. System was easy to set up and I was able to be playing within 15 minutes.

"I understand that many of us like to limit screen time for our kids, but the hand-eye skills kids learn with these child friendly games are very good. Buying these for my nieces and nephews as well.

I have been tracking on this V2 Second Generation Switch for at least six months. I have been trying to find all kind of sources but it seems lots buyers try to stock them and resell in higher value. Maybe amazon and other platforms can only allow one buyer with one product only through their ID. Waiting period was not accurate since it shows will be arrived in October thus the delivery period is not accurate and unorganized timing.,2,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

I got this for my son who is 6. He loves playing it and so do I. The system is amazing in so many ways of using it. Very easy and quick to set up. Easy and quick to switch from TV playing to the Switch console without losing your points in the game. Work great with the internet. The battery life is better than the old version. We really enjoy it.,5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,1
"My daughter asked for this as a Christmas gift. It's easy to set up an account and download the games. I preferred this method instead of buying cartridges. For her convenience, I bought a memory card. She uses the device when we travel, have to use waiting rooms, or similar activities. She can also invite a friend to play since each can use a control, or whatever it's called.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"Nintendo has done it again. This is a great product with a lot of variety of games including some with motion control. The apps are a bit lacking compared to say the ps4 so don’t expect a web browser or Plex.Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bro’s and Mario Kart are the definitive titles (sold separately) and they are really fun for all ages. Of course the biggest appeal of the Switch is the ability to go from TV to portable. The best thing is that when the adults are using the TV the kids can still happily play",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0

"Wow, Nintendo has again leapfrogged the market, hit a niche like the Wii.We bought the Wii for the kids (and the parents) 10 years ago.  Other than replacing some game discs that stopped working due to overuse the Wii has been the best buy ever.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"The center console itself was fine - it was actually the newer version (XKW) with longer battery life. However my joycons were very clearly heavily used, and the left one had drift so severe it was useless. It’s not too much of a hassle to get replacement parts from other sellers, but it is frustrating having to wait another week to use my new switch.Aside from the joycon issue, it was packaged nicely and shipped quickly with all parts accounted for. I’m sure once my replacement part comes in I’ll be more than satisfied with this purchase.",3,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"I really love this, but my only complaints are that I was supposed to get the gray joycons but I got the red and blue, and that it had a game predownloaded. Idk if that’s how it comes, but it was super easy to delete. So glad I got this, and the color thing is basically a non issue.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,2,0

"Exactly as it was described, and it arrived early. It is still overpriced, but it came in a sealed (but slightly beat up box) and everything came in their original packaging.If you're wondering what it comes with (because I was), it's the console itself, a single set of controllers (joy cons), a controller base for your joycons, the dock for the console so you can play on a TV, an HDMI cable, and a charger.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
The Nintendo switch I ordered came about 2 weeks early from when it was supposed to be originally shipped. It works well and is constantly being played by my girlfriend for hours on end.

Please restock in large amounts and I would truly give it 5 stars.",4,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"Very well done. Kinda taken back at the durability and power of this unit for being a handheld. Was reluctant to buy because I thought it would chintzy but no, this thing is legit. If you have been holding out on getting one of these, dont. Seriously my favorite console now.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
"My son loves the product BUT the reason I gave it only 3 stars, is because they offered a promotion for a $30 credit/gift card for buying the Switch & when I tried to use it, it came back as invalid & when I contacted Amazon about it, they were useless! So, I was never able to use the $30. Promotion!!",3,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"It's adaptability to different scenarios (tv, portable, multiplayer, etc) is really neat. It's getting a decent amount of games found on other systems and PC, and if you have more time to play handheld than in front of a TV, it's pretty neat to be able to play some AAA games wherever I am.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0

"Prior to purchase, I knew that the Switch was an awesome platform. After purchasing one, it has quickly become my favorite console.

Nintendo once again putting in minimal work. You literally can’t find these switches anywhere and once they come back in stock they are out of stock before you can get your card information in to order it. I guess I’ll hold off on playing the new animal crossing and other switch games I’ve wanted to buy until Nintendo learns how to mass produce consoles. If you buy from resellers your mom never loved you.,1,0,2020-3-17,1,2,0
"The ordered was delivered as promised. The product comes with the dock, the joy-cons, cables and accessories to play. The Nintendo Switch is just a great hybrid console, having so much fun with it. The screen looks better that the last one. The joy-cons are working without any problem, been playing for about 40 hours now without any issues on the console or any part, if something goes wrong will update this info.Nintendo has a huge library now and since the PS5 and Scarlett come next year, they are like transitioning, this is maybe the best time to get a Nintendo Switch.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

I finally was able to buy this Nintendo Switch for my kids after weeks of trying. It's really designed well and the graphics are surprisingly good for a portable gaming system. Really impressed. My kids are always fighting to who will use it so at least it's keeping them busy while at home. Wish they had more games available but I'm sure more will come out in the future.,4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
My son is in lower grade of elementary school. Nintendo switch is the best game console for us because many games for kids are exclusive on Nintendo. The console can be used for TV projection or hand hold so it is good for both home and travel. The battery life is good too.,5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Siempre fui #Fan de otras consolas y quería un cambio para complementar mis días libres, al principio dude en comprarlo por la variedad de juegos! sin embargo, cuenta con muchos clásicos y otros nuevos para no perder nunca la diversión.

It doesn't have any problems with wandering joysticks or the screen being scratched by the dock like older versions of the switch. The animal crossing design and blue/green controllers look very nice. Overall, a worthy purchase.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0

"The product is pretty good, but there are some things I think Nintendo could have done better. I think Nintendo could have marketed this to an older audience, because there are some features, such as Netflix and other things of the like that are not available.

It also came a little later than I expected but still in the time frame it gave me. Overall it's a great product but an outrageous price.",4,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"The system is great, and I love many of the games on the switch. However, I’m not impressed when I take over a year to save up the money, and I find the product already has scratches, and the red joycon spontaneously disconnects and needs to be reset multiple times in each gameplay session. The console is great, but perhaps consider purchasing from somewhere other than amazon.",2,1,2019-11-27,1,1,1

"While technologically inferior to the other 2 consoles of this gen, the Switch is hands down the most fun of them all.

Nothing can beat being able to play your favorite games anywhere you want. Definitely a must buy.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"The switch works great, and I actually use a mini docking station, so it fits it perfectly. The joy cons that came with it are not working properly, so that has been a struggle.

The Switch is a great size. In it's handheld form it is still thin enough to fit into traveling cases and bags. While it does have weight it isn't too heavy to carry for a good amount of time.

"Let me start by saying that I am so glad I got this switch. I didn’t buy it from a scalper or even from Amazon— on launch day, Target had a few units available and pure determination had me up at 1am to order for pick-up in store and in Time Square at store opening to ensure I got my unit.Unfortunately, as is true with many Nintendo special/limited editions, a bunch of absolutely horrible, awful people have bought out these units with the intention of selling them at an inflated rate to make a profit. And sadly they succeed in their slimy business venture because of the high desirability of these items.

Raising the price this high should be a felony a Nintendo switch is worth $300 tops.

For reference, amazon has restocked about 4 times since then. Each window lasting about 5 minutes. I finally snagged one this morning at about 4:30 AM PST. Amazon is opening up small windows where they are selling original (new) stock, periodically every couple of hours. So don't give up hope!

How many devices have such a poor warranty?  All those who buy and use the cheapest components they can buy.

"I’m so disappointed to just be learning that Nintendo has one of the WORST ecosystems around, I wanted to love them. We got our lite first then a week later a regular switch. I purchased a few (overpriced!) games with the lite, with my account and soon learned my daughter or wife can’t play them in their accounts. Then my wife and I started playing Animal Crossing, I setup my island first and later she did but she remarked how her island had the same name as mine. Turns out Nintendo intentionally limits you to the same island per switch console!  WTF kind of money grab is that bulls$&*t Then I purchased 3 months of online gaming on my account on my Switch and started playing the streaming SNES games. My daughter started playing on her lite under my account so she could play Paw Patrol that I had purchased on my account on the lite. It kicked me offline immediately since you can’t have two online at the same time in the same account. So if you have multiple family members, they all need accounts and need to purchase their games all separate on their own accounts. I have never, ever, before seen other gaming systems with such intentional money grab schemes in my life. I tried adding the other accounts together as a family account but Nintendo verifies this by charging the main accounts card! You can just send an email to verify but instead need to charge their card! I’d advise staying away from such a ridiculous product.",1,0,2020-5-29,1,1,0

"The Switch Lite may fall short in many areas, but this is the one to get. Its an improved original switch, with better battery life. However about 2 hours of battery life is the only difference, so if you find the old switch at a discount price that may be worth getting as well. This one has all the features and you can be sure all games will work with it, unlike the Switch Lite. The Switch Lite isn't worth getting IMO.The biggest pro IMO of the switch is the detachable joy-con's. I have never seen a handheld with detachable joy-con's before this one, and its a huge improvement. If you get sticky buttons, worn out buttons or have a problem with your joy-con's you can just swap them with a new set instead of having to replace the whole handheld. Because of Joy-con drift Nintendo is now fixing Joy-Con's for free so you can buy 2 sets of joy-con's and send one out while the other set is getting fixed. I play Pokemon and a lot of it which requires mashing the A button a lot so I used to find that the A button got worn down much faster than other buttons on previous systems. It was a very complicated procedure to fix this problem on previous handhelds, they didn't come apart too easily if you could get them apart at all. If you tinker or like taking things apart its much easier to take apart a single joy-con and replace a button pad rather than it is to take apart most of a handheld to reach the part that needs to be replaced. This increases the longevity of the system and makes it more durable without having to spend a lot of money on future systems.",5,0,2019-11-24,1,2,0

"The switch and accessories are cheaply made. My first issue with the the system was the controls.... The controllers are insanely expensive and luckily my wife bought me a extra set of controls for my Christmas present when she bought the switch because within a couple months two of the 4 controllers stopped working. Looked it up and apparently alot of people were having this issue. But was deploying and really wasnt to worried about it. So got back from my deployment and tried to play  my switch on the dock and guess what that decided it wasn't going to work either, looked this up... Guess what alot of people had that same issue too. If I want to replace the dock and one set of controllers it would cost over half the price of the system. Every other system has expensive accessories but I can depend on them to work. But I do love the switch but hate the fact I can't use it on the TV to actually play games with my family which is half of the reason people buy this system... Other wise I would rather stick with my PlayStation for anything at home and only play my switch if I'm out of the house and have nothing to do.",1,0,2019-12-29,1,1,0

The game is glitchy, won't load, or constantly shuts off mid-game. Nintendo has to know the Minecraft game is this way because its been this way for two years with no improvement. We have played on other systems with no problem. We have also had problems with our joy con controllers. The joy stick on both gets stuck in forward and its a pain to get them to connect to the system EVERYTIME! It even doesnt want to connect to it when you slide into the sides to play on the go. Needless to say I feel let down by Nintendo and feel this product is very poorly made. Controllers are also very expensive for this sysyem to not last longer than they did!

"Switch’s big sell is its versatility. As I’ve already stated, it’s both a handheld and a home console. Its innards are powerful enough to deliver better-than-Wii U visuals, no matter where you happen to be. If you want to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the bus, you can. If you’d rather sit in front of your TV and sink your teeth into some competitive online Splatoon 2, you can do that too. Heck, if you fancy a two-player game of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe while sat in the park, I would be 100% behind that decision.Pro: It’s extremely flexible. The main selling point of Switch is its ability to transform from a home console to a portable gaming system in a snap. And on that front, it works as well as advertised. Transitioning from one style of gaming to another takes seconds and lets you continue playing right where you left off. A likely use-case is people who want to keep playing when their spouse/parent/roommate wants to watch something on the TV",4,0,2019-12-4,1,1,0

"I'm a huge Animal Crossing fan. I also never had a Switch before, nor was I going to get one, because it just didn't appeal to me. I also never had a special edition console before either. I was going to skip this console even though a brand new Animal Crossing game was announced, but when they announced this Switch. I just couldn't pass this one up. The Animal Crossing game itself wasn't something that appeal to me either. It looks like it plays too much like Pocket Camp. It doesn't seem like it plays like your traditional Animal Crossing game, so I was going to just pass up on it. Now that I own the Switch. Hopefully I can get some more games for it besides Animal Crossing. That way It won't feel like a complete waste of money on purchasing it.Anyway, the system is adorable and I'm happy that I have it. I waited a day too late to pre-order it, so on release date. I had to get up early to hit my local Target. I went to my local Wal-Mart, but they was clueless as to what I was talking about. Even though I called two days earlier and they said they know of three they had in stock. My local GameStop said they'll have extras too, but that store is the store I go to as my last resort. I'm not a fan of GameStop (even though I pre-ordered New Horizons there.)  My Wal-Mart is extremely ghetto. No good Customer service at all and workers got terrible attitudes and are impatient with their customers. I went home after being at Wal-Mart for a little over an hour waiting for them to open up their electronics section and my phone had died. When I got home, I called them to see if the electronics were open. Still no answer, so I gave up on Wal-Mart. I decided to call my local Target after I looked up what time they open. I called the first time which was no answer, so I waited a few minutes and called again. They finally picked up and told me they had quite a few systems after I asked them. When I went to my Target. It was only two people back in the electronics section and they were not looking for a Special Edition Animal Crossing Switch. I was the only one looking for it. I got my copy and headed home finally able to rest since I didn't sleep all night that previous night. I wouldn't be surprised if my local Target still have some in stock.",5,0,2020-3-19,1,0,1
I use to not mind the battery of the original switch until recently. Playing witcher 3 drained the battery in about 2 hours on my old switch and it was annoying.

"I’ve had my Nintendo Switch for about a year and half and I can definitely say I have not regretted that purchase since. Although I have the original version that has the shorter battery life, this shouldn’t take away from the review. I still have managed to seek hundreds of hours into all my games. As of right now I have 5 games which includes Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Pokemon Sword, and Fire Emblem Three Houses. These are all great games to choose but I recommend Super Mario Odyssey as your first game of choice as it is super enjoyable for just about everyone. The Switch feels great in both handheld and TV mode. To summarize, the Nintendo Switch is an amazing product for not only hardcore Nintendo Fans but also for average person or family.But to get to why you should consider getting a Nintendo Switch, the first and most marketed reason is that you can both play it on your TV and on the go. When the Nintendo Switch goes to handheld mode, it experiences very little noticeable graphic drops. Being able to play your favorite games whenever you want is an amazing experience, especially with such high graphics compared to other handheld consoles. The second reason is that a lot of games with multiplayer, both first and third party, allow the Switches new joy-con controllers to be split into two controllers so two people can play at the same time without buying another controller. Some of the big games that are compatible with this are Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart, which are the Switches top 10 highest selling games. As for the third and final reason is that all first party games and most third-party games offer a great game play and an overall great experience to a game. The Switch even comes with a grip to hold both of them together and wrist strips for when they are separate. A small point to add is that the rest of Switch items, the two chords and dock are really easy to set-up and take anywhere. It’s made easier to carry them with the overabundance of Switch accessories everywhere.",5,0,2020-9-13,1,1,0

"Cool toy and my child loves it. However, for a child to use it, you MUST make your own Nintendo account as well as a child account, download the app to set some parental controls, then use their website to set another round of parental controls. Really poorly designed and not intuitive. For example, when making an account, it allows you to use Google, Facebook etc instead of setting a unique Nintendo password. Convenient! However, you can’t buy anything without a parental password, so once you get father along and try to download something, they forgot about the Google sign in and you need to go back to the beginning and set up new Nintendo password for the parent.

However, when I'm at home, this system gives me the option of playing on the TV as well.It comes with everything you need to start playing (except for a game). I've got a couple of games for it and also downloaded free games. I haven't purchased a SD card and haven't had any issues with space. I haven't upgraded the joy cons or purchased a pro controller. My wife and I play Mario on this a few times a week with the joy cons and they work just fine.

The amount of time spent with the Switch dwarfs the others, with the gaming PC coming in a distant second.

Each of my modules behaves in one of those two ways, although the one that slides off may be because the other needs to be forced off.  Went though customer support and still having issue with ""fixed"" modules.  Can't find a way to contact support directly, only automated contact through web site.

Another disaster from Nintendo following the Wii u calamity. Just a mess of a product even for a long time Nintendo enthusiast. Joy cons are a joke. Just keep buying other controllers. Visually mediocre. Avoid at all costs. Nintendo needs an entire regroup as a whole after this one. People will say it's fun but they are lying to themselves. If you grab a couple oversized Wii wheels Mario kart is solid but it's pretty much the same as Mario kart on Wii. The last good product they put out. My advice put the thing up for sale along with your Wii u on offer up or marketplace and dust off your Wii. Cause this is a train wreck from top to bottom. Slow loading visually poor it just goes on and on and on. I will never turn my back on Nintendo due to years of joy and great nostalgia but they are starting to push it,1,0,2019-12-26,1,1,0

"I like this one a lot better than the switch lite. It's bigger, and the screen is much more colorful, and brighter. It also doesn't hurt my hands like the switch lite did after playing for a while. I think because the controls are a little bigger. The battery lasts a long time. I had to charge my switch lite 2-3 times to get the same play time out of it as this system.I play Mario Kart online for 2+ hours and still had 30% battery left. The next day I was able to get another 1.5 hours of Mario Kart off that last 30%. I ended up charging it at 16% because I didn't want to run the battery all the way down.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,3,0
"We have 6 kids who played on and loved the Xbox, only thing is I wanted more kid type games for them so we ended up buying a switch and then Immediately a second one for our other room because we loved it so much. Every day since they have rushed to get school done, so they can play on it. We homeschool. We love all the games, only thing we wished they had was Roblox for the switch as they love those games as well. Do wish they had a bigger selection of games and each game is pretty expensive but you can sometimes find better deals online on Nintendo’s website. Make sure if you want digital to get a bigger memory card. Maybe one day they will have Roblox available. We also loved that it is super easy to travel with so we bought a case to protect them and took them to grandma’s as she has nothing for the littler kids to do. What was even cooler is that you can set it up on its stand and play multiple player even without a TV screen which is amazing!!! So many cool things about it as you don’t need internet to play either, it can be played solo or with others. Also love the dance 2020 game as the whole family gets up and dances together. The parental control blocks are also a bonus!!! Not to mention Xbox family is double the cost so a year of family on the switch is very affordable at about half cost. The size is also very compact and small. I’ll share a pic as size comparison. Oh and we bought a screen protector as well as I was worried sliding it in and out of the console might scratch it. Hope this helps! Oh and the pic is of the same switch but different color joycons. The gray one is in the other room but I wanted to show you the compact size. So look for the blue and red gaming console next to clock. For size comparison our TV is a 65”.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,1,1
Great casual gaming. I suggest hunting down the physical disks over utilizing the Nintendo store if she'd like to maximize your dollar value in a long run. If you have large hands I'd also suggest getting a remote control that fits your hands. I like that the switch has so many options available of controllers. all of the players in my house have been able to find forms that are comfortable for them. As a huge Mario fan there's no other place for me to get these titles. the biggest hit on the system is that many of the streaming services do not have applications or programs available at this time which is just strange to me.,5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"Bought for my son’s birthday! Great video game console. It is very small and light which makes it very portable. The screen isn't too small, but just right to be able to use it without problem.

The system is rugged and well built and we have no problems with it when it comes to its hardware. It is very comfortable in the hand and we have no problem playing with it for a long periods of time. The battery is also great. It lasts him hours of playtime without problem and is great for commutes.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0

I have to say, this multi functional console is awesome. Console can be used like a 3DS or like a regular console (has a docking station). Highly recommended.

O novo nintendo switch é uma versão apenas REVISADA. Não houve NENHUM CUSTO ADICIONAL. Essa prática de sair ganhando em cima da ignorância das pessoas deve acabar. NÃO COMPREM ESSE VIDEO GAME. O VALOR DE MERCADO ESTÁ NA FAIXA DOS 2000 e você facilmente encontra abaixo disso.,1,1,2019-12-9,0,1,0

"La consola muy bien y más barata que la versión anterior, mi hermano tiene un Switch y ahora yo quería la versión 1.1. Todo perfecto, de hecho llego muy rápido pero el detalle fue que la caja venía dañada y muy sucia: polveada y con manchas como de aceite. Para mi la caja importa por que las colecciono. Además la caja no venía sellada, se nota que los manuales, joycons y la pantalla habían sido removidos por alguien. Hace dudar que sea 100% nueva la consola. Al ser un comprador recurrente de Amazon incluso Prime, esto me ha decepcionado un poco.",3,1,2019-10-18,0,1,1

While the system is beautiful I have never bought a special edition console that didn't come with the game it was based on and therefore assumed this one came with the new Animal Crossing. Wasn't expecting to drop another 80$ for the game and it's not really specifically stated that it didn't come with it. My Animal Crossing 3DS came with the game and my Windwaker WiiU came with the game. It seems like Nintendo cheapest out on this system with not including the game.,3,1,2020-3-17,0,6,0

"The nintendo switch in my opinion is one of the best portable consoles in the world. Its very light, very powerful, and is really portable. The nintendo switch gives you possibilities to play wherever you want and whenever you want. Which is something you can't do with an Xbox one or a PS4. The game selection is constantly expanding with many games some of my favorite being Minecraft and Super Mario Bros Ultimate. I myself am a mario fan and this console lets me play whatever mario game I want in its amazing 720p or 1080p docked screen. The joycons feel awesome in the hand and truly are unique. Overall the nintendo switch is an amazing console by nintendo and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable gaming console.",5,1,2019-10-22,0,3,0
"Sim, o Switch atendeu bem às expectativas. O engraçado é que já não vejo mais ele como um console portátil, ou apenas dessa forma e sim como um console em miniatura pois é possível jogar com a mobilidade de um portátil e o conforto de um joystick padrão.Pontos negativos: a conexão do switch com o Wifi é péssima e não foi nessa versão revisada que melhoraram, infelizmente. Outra que o aparelho não contém lacres na caixa e plásticos que contém seus componentes, o que o deixa com cara de usado.",3,1,2019-11-9,0,2,0
"I bought a switch when they first came out, completed Zelda Breath of the Wild and eventually Super Mario Odyssey, then never picked it up again... sold it and missed it forever due to the fact that Nintendo decided to grace us with an impressive game library to date, what ultimately sells me on the switch now, is its portability, and to take all the wonderful games not just the Nintendo name has to offer but other big name titles as well, I would like however to see more apps within the store, along with classic titles that were available on Wii&WiiU store overall you can never go wrong in *investing* in a Nintendo product.",5,1,2019-10-4,0,2,0

"The Nintendo Switch is the best!! It's portable, light weight, and perfect for gaming on the go. The unboxing and setup experience was easy and straight forward. It has lots of fun games and Nintendo exclusives making it a great gaming system. The battery lasts long and the product itself feels very high quality too. I use my Switch mostly in handheld mode but playing in TV mode is just so much better because of the 1080p output and bigger screen. The joy-cons feel very nice in the hand and the HD rumble makes the games feel so much more immersive. The dock is also not as big as I thought it would be and it doesn't take up much space either. There is even a HDMI cable included so even if you don't have a spare one, you don't have to worry because it's already included in the box.Also another thing to note, the Switch does not have a built in microphone, so in order to voice chat with your friends in online games like Fortnite, you have to connect a pair of headphones that have a mic, use a gaming headset, or use the Nintendo Switch Online app on your phone or tablet. Some games also require the Nintendo Switch Online Subscription in order to play online but its very cheap and affordable at only $4.99/month or $24.99/annually. I am glad that Nintendo has chosen to keep the online subscription prices so low!",5,1,2020-1-10,0,1,0

"Gran consola, que aunque carece de potencia como xbox o playstation, es una opcion buenísima para jugar, y el hecho de ser hibrida entre portatil y sobremesa le da muchisimo valor. Los materiales de la consola se sienten de buena calidad, excepto los joycons, que no es que sean malos, pero se siente muy delicados, eso si, no me han dado ningún tipo de problema, asi que quizas solo sea la sensacion de fragilidad. La pantalla cumple muy bien, aun que ahi ya depende tambien de los juegos, agunos se ven mejor que otros en modo portatil. Es recomendable comprar una mica de cristal, ya que aun que es el nuevo modelo no parece que hayan arreglado del todo el problema de la fricción con el dock, y con una cuantas veces que lo he metido se a rayado (Aun que no fueron marcas permanentes, quizás con el tiempo si sean permanentes). La bateria dura bastante, no podria decir la diferencia con el modelo anterior por que no lo tengo, pero por lo general me dura entre 6-9 horas usandolo con diferentes juegos.",5,1,2019-9-21,0,1,0

I also bought several fitness games, so hopefully it will motivate me enough to lose some weight?The Nintendo online is slightly confusing for me, because I thought, by reading comments somewhere, that all games in-store will be free after purchasing the membership, but it's not really the case. The membership is more for the online co-op play, cloud saving data, and Nintendo Entertainment System.

Used two stock alert sites to email me. You have to be quick it usually sells out within 1-4 min.

"I setup email alerts on nowinstock (google it). Was finally able to get a new Switch!!! I had the Switch Lite but didn’t enjoy the handheld only mode. I am a long time PC gamer and not really big on consoles but Zelda BOTW and Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Maker 2, and Animal Crossing are such fantastic games. Literally this console is worth buying even for 1 of those game’s I listed. My last Nintendo product was a GameCube I received as a child Christmas gift and this is the best purchase I made in years. No regrets at all. The neon colors are awesome too . I wasn’t sure about gaming with separate Joycons but it’s very comfortable. I ended up buying a refurbished pro controller to go with the console and it’s a good buy too if you’re coming from Xbox or ps4. I found the joycon grip to be too small for my hands",5,1,2020-5-4,0,4,0

With most graphic-heavy games like Breath of the Wild, Dragon Quest XI, or Astral Chain, my battery would be almost completely drained in about three hours.This is the newer, more recent version of the Switch with the supposed extended battery life.  I figured it was time for an upgrade and I made the purchase.  In all honesty, the battery is much improved over my launch model.  My three or so hours of battery life have now gone to about five hours or so with the same types of games.

I know there are people who has joycon drift, which is when the joycon stick has problems and it turns by itself causing the camera or character to move. So far I haven't had that yet, it could be since these are the new Switch version they might've done a bit of tweaking but not sure on that.",5,1,2020-5-9,0,0,0

I've been using it for almost a week and have not run into any problems (touch wood) definitely recommend since Amazon is a legit place to buy instead of places like carousel where you can get scammed.

"Excelente el servicio de Amazon, tuve un fallo con el primero e inmediatamente me lo cambiaron, el nintendo switch sencillamente es la mejor consola de la generación, vale cada centavo con o sin descuento, tengo 3 Nintendo Switch y el único problema que noto con esta revisión, es que sinceramente no se nota para nada la diferencia en la duración de la batería en modo portátil, lo siento muy similar, incluso igual, diría yo, pero es mi punto de vista, quizá porque el tiempo pasa volando mientras juegas, pero es muy difícil notar una diferencia",5,1,2019-11-10,0,2,0
"This is the first switch that I have ever owned.  I had put off buying one for the longest time and when Animal Crossing was getting closer to being released, I realized that I had to stop waiting and purchase a switch.  I than procrastinated even longer and Nintendo dropped this special edition.  So in the end I learned that if I wait, good things will come my way.  The colors are beautiful, system works wonderfully and I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  It's so damn cute and looks adorable next to my TV.",5,1,2020-3-25,0,2,0
"4.5 Stars - From a fun console to one of the hottest commodities especially during the pandemic, Nintendo probably hit the jackpot on the versatility of this item.

"Comprei o New Nintendo Switch vendido pela BalbinoShop. O produto foi entregue no prazo, no entanto, tem sido mais fonte de frustração do que de divertimento. Em 20 dias de uso, só foi possível usá-lo em duas ocasiões, porque o aparelho constantemente trava na tela inicial ou nas telas laranja e azul. O desligamento total pelo acionamento do botão superior na tela, orientado pelo fabricante, não funciona. A única forma de desligá-lo completamente é esperar que a bateria se esgote, o que leva dias, para então carregá-lo e eventualmente dar de cara com telas travadas mais uma vez. E no meio desta pandemia, o atendimento na assistência Nintendo está suspenso. Então o produto se encontra sem uso. Me pergunto se o produto entregue foi entregue íntegro e em perfeitas condições de funcionamento pelo vendedor da Amazon. Vamos precisar esperar a avaliação da assistência Nintendo, quando o atendimento for regularizado.",2,1,2020-6-19,0,2,0
"During this time, it's incredibly hard to order this item. But if you sit for long enough and refresh the page, you'll get one! And it's worth it!This console feels fantastic, and in my opinion, it is perfect for light or heavy gaming. It works SO well for family gaming too. This is the best all-around console I've ever had. Now, there are a few tiny flaws, but everything has its flaws. There are hundreds of cute and super fun indie games to play, like Goose Game, Cuphead, Hyper Light Drifter, etc, and heavier stuff like Dark Souls and (soon) Bioshock. Also, it's incredibly customizable! You can get sticker skins and put a clear hard case over it (which I did!) and you can buy different colour joy cons or customize them with coloured shells (but BE CAREFUL it's very tricky to change the shells).",5,1,2020-4-14,0,2,0

I love that I can just pick it up and go, play full current gen games on a hand held, and just stick it back in the dock, and it's a home console again, seamlessly. It's next level, in that regard. I don't think it replaces a PS4, Xbox, or PC, but it is certainly a great addition, if not only for the exclusive Nintendo content. I mostly use it to play retro arcade games, Animal Crossing, and Tetris...oh god, the Tertis is strong with this system.If you want one, you likely won't regret getting one, it's all that Mario/Zelda goodness.",5,1,2020-6-26,0,1,0

"O New Nintendo Switch Cinza foi uma excelente aquisição para esse período de festas de final de ano. Não só pela diversão que seus jogos exclusivos proporcionam, como também pelo excelente modo portátil do console, que nos permite levá-lo para qualquer lugar que queiramos. O destaque do ""New"" vai para a bateria do console, que possui uma duração maior e carrega com mais rapidez.Talvez a única crítica que eu tenha sobre o videogame, seja em relação aos periféricos que, apesar de não-essenciais, melhoram a experiência do jogador. No caso, comprei a película pra tela, para evitar arranhões, um bom cartão de memória e fiz a assinatura anual ""Switch Online"", para poder usar os recursos online dos jogos da plataforma. De quebra, essa assinatura também libera uma porção de jogos de NES e SNES pra jogar quando quiser no console.",5,1,2020-1-2,0,4,0
"This is a fantastic console. Going from my tv to portable is seemless, and the portable screen is very good in it's own right. One minor nitpick I have is that the screen feels kind of loose in yhe dock, but that's mostly because they want the switchto come out of the dock smoothly. Overall, a great console.One thing though, getting this console on amazon is a frustrating ordeal. Other sellers buy out amazon's stock and sell it for double the price. I wanted to get the switch for it's actual price, and it took me three months and a miracle to actually get a switch before amazon's stock went out. So while the console is great, buying it on amazon is frustrating. Hopefully this will get better when the pandemic is over.",5,1,2020-8-9,0,2,0
"This Switch comes with everything that you need to get started: Console, TV Dock, one (1) pair of Joycons with controllers and handstraps, one (1) joycon controller grip, HDMI cable, Type C power adaptor.

"This is the best system design for a console ever. So ingenious and feels great in hand. Even docked it is smaller than any other console. But somehow, despite being the graphically inferior console and basically consisting of mostly ports, they still have the most expensive games, not to mention the most expensive accessories. Also really inconvenient that you need to dock the joycons to charge them instead being able to charge them while playing the switch in dock mode.

Genial la idea de tener su propia pantalla, lo que la hace perfectamente portable, el tipo de juegos que soporta (la inmensa mayoría) son para el mercado infantil, muy caricaturescos, muy para niños. No está mal... pero se siente un tanto frágil en cuanto a materiales. Los controles están demasiado pequeños para ser usados cómodamente por un adulto (consola para niños, a fin de cuentas).Para lo que es, la calidad de materiales y el muy limitado catálogo de juegos, encuentro un contrasentido el hecho de que sea la consola más cara de las 3 grandes (Xbox, PS4 y Switch); en mi opinión está MUY sobre valorada con respecto al precio.

Los joy-con se tienen que cargar, así que no es posible dejarlos siempre en modo de correa, separados de la consola, a menos que tengas un cargador, obviamente también requiere retirar el adaptador con las correas.Es muy sencillo colocar al revés los adaptadores de correa a los joy-con, así que estén atentos con sus hijos para que los conecten correctamente para evitar dañarlos, ya que son accesorios muy caros.",5,1,2019-12-4,0,0,0

Fortunately I was at home and checking periodically to receive it. I would have expected an attempt to hide or leave the package at the back porch since it’s an expensive item $400+ that could have been stolen easily.",5,1,2020-9-17,0,1,0
"I waited until Animal Crossing was announced to buy a switch. And although I don't regret my purchase, it's rather frustrating that the display on my console went dark within a week. Turns out Nintendo used a different manufacturer for the animal crossing switches, and some other users are also reporting the screen going black and not working in handheld mode.Called Nintendo and their repair centres are currently closed due to the pandemic. I understand that they had to switch manufacturers, but that doesn't mean the quality of their product should be less compared to their usual standard.",4,1,2020-4-14,0,0,0
"Switch was delivered fast and in great condition. Box was not dented, which is important for limited edition packaging. While this is one of the nicer looking switches, do take note that it does not come with the new animal crossing game. It is quite strange for a limited edition console not to come with the game that it is themed around, especially when its JPN and UK editions do.Price was gouged though. It cost $60 more than when it was first in stock here, and I thought I'd be happy to absorb it because of the game, but it didn't and I still have to fork out another $70+ for a copy of the game. Now I have an expensive console with no games to play, real bummer.",4,1,2020-6-15,0,1,0

Lo fácil que es rayar la pantalla con el dock (algo que puede ser fácilmente arreglado con un protector de pantalla) y su exagerado precio en latinoamerica. Fuera de ello es sin duda una de las mejores de esta generación. Recomendable en cualquier caso, pero especialmente cuando está de oferta en black Friday o buen fin.",5,1,2019-12-21,0,0,0

"A pesar de que acabo de adquirir mi Nintendo Stwich y de que sólo tengo  2 juegos... el concepto de consola híbrida ya la hace un ""consolon"" desde mi punto de vista. Es verdad que soy un Fan de Nintendo, y de jugar muy poco consolas de Sony o Microsoft. Y pensarás que mi comentario esta muy influenciado por ese gusto personal a esta franquicia o marca... Pero tener todos los juegos emblematicos de nintendo que ya están a la venta y los que vienen a futuro, mas la apuesta a tener títulos orientados a un publico mas adulto que puedes encontrar en Play Station o Xbox. Poderlos jugar en todo momento de tu vida hace que sea una gran ventaja sin importar mucho la desventaja de gráficos menos potentes.  Para mi esto ultimo no es tan importante, si el juego es realmente divertido. Si las consolas como Wii o Wii U te detienen a comprar este producto ya que no perdieron el rumbo contra sus competidores, esta nueva consola esta poniendo a Nintendo  como lo que es.
